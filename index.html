We are still not seeing any changes being made at the company but it does change the attitude that HR has on us, and it does make it slightly better. Thank you :)

                              <span>Hi all,
 We were recently discussing the Microsoft Authenticator app in a meeting. Someone mentioned they store all their passwords in it rather than in Chrome / Edge. One of us - fairly senior member of the team- became concerned about this and basically said:
 &quot;Well the whole point of MFA is you have a known password, and then a thing, and that thing is either a hardware token, or the MFA app - However if the app now stores passwords, doesn&#x27;t that defeat the purpose of MFA?&quot;
 From my point of view, it would be way too much of a faux pas if Microsoft just hadn&#x27;t thought of this, and with our phones being in Intune, they have to have a password, they likely have biometrics etc, so i cant see it being an issue?
 Also i just tried signing in with my work account to the password keeper part, and it wouldnt accept the details, as it needs to be a Microsoft account, not a Work or school account.
 Does anyone else have any views on this that would help me articulate clearly to my colleague why this wouldnt be a security issue? Thanks

                              <span>This may be a really dumb question, apologies if so. I have inherited a group policy that restricts which Edge browser extensions can be installed. There&#x27;s a lot in the list, but the policy only stores &quot;extension ID&quot;s and I can&#x27;t find a way to figure out what the extension is from the ID. Googling this just returns how to get the ID, not how to use the ID to figure out the name of the extension. 
 If anyone knows I would appreciate a point in the right direction!

                              <span>Hi, 
 I am working with CIS custom Image for my EC2 - AMZ2 instance.
 I am facing a new finding in the Inspector result, which is:
 Ensure use of privileged commands is collected 
 The recommended action is to run the following command:
 # find -xdev \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -type f | awk &#x27;{print \&quot;-a always,exit -F path&#x3D;&quot; $1 &quot; -F perm&#x3D;x - F auid&gt;&#x3D;1000 -F auid!&#x3D;4294967295 \-k privileged&quot; }&#x27; 
 And add the results to the:
 /etc/ audit/rules.d/audit.rules 
 ​
 But, when running this command; I got a syntax error.
 ​
 So, I tried to add the following lines (Containing my partitions) to the mentioned file, but this finding still appears in the inspector report.
 -a always,exit -F path&#x3D;/dev/xvda -F perm&#x3D;x -F auid&gt;&#x3D;1000 -F auid!&#x3D;4294967295 -k privileged -a always,exit -F path&#x3D;/dev/xvdb -F perm&#x3D;x -F auid&gt;&#x3D;1000 -F auid!&#x3D;4294967295 -k privileged

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 It&#x27;s kind of a never ending topic, but I&#x27;d like to discuss it with you :
  
As a starting point, which firewall logs would you forward to your SIEM ?
 How do you improve your strategy over time ?
  
Do you go by log severity ? By policy ? What would be your different opinions ?
 I&#x27;ve been talking with many sysadmin and no one of them was doing it the same way. So I&#x27;d like to here your take on this subject !
 Thank y&#x27;all !

                              <span>Hello
 I manage a server for an important site which is regularly the target for DDoS attacks etc. The site is occasionally sending out newsletters to subscribers. That server is hosted on Hetzner. Hetzner has been contacting me with abuse requests (AbusePhishing: SPAM/PHISH Complaint) that people have sent them and is now threatening to shut down the server. I had a look at those forwarded emails and I discovered that the Message-ID hashes cannot be found in my /var/log/mail* logs (I have enough logs to cover the timestamps that those emails have allegedly been sent from my server). The emails content contains the newsletter content from the site but also appends various Pfizer spam links and images. All other legit emails that the site has sent can very easily be found via grepping their Message-IDs in /var/log/mail*.
 Question: Is there a possibility that a malicious actor has subscribed to the site&#x27;s newsletter, copy/pasted the email that was sent to them, polluted it with spam links, and reported this as an abuse to their provider, in hope that it&#x27;ll reach Hetzner which will in turn threaten with shutting down the server? Does this thing (&quot;fake spam abuse claims&quot;) actually exist? Have you heard about it before?

                              <span>So I read up on a lot of pros and cons of having multi-tenants and I have a good idea when it comes to enterprises. 
 However, if you work in Education or my case Higher Ed you know things are... different? 
 At the moment our staff and faculty have always used Exchange while students have always used Gmail. 
 Well, now we are going to move students over to Microsoft 365 along with exchange online.
 My question is, does your institute use different tenants? One for students and one for Staff? Or do you put them all under the same tenant and if so do you use different domains for each?
 I&#x27;m leaning toward having 2 tenants. 
 What have your experiences been?

                              <span>Hi fellow Redditors
 Due to also some recent ransomware that had attacked also my company&#x27;s competitor, some people, that in my and a colleague of mine opinion are trying to justify their pay, have had this &quot;novel&quot; idea to change the wallpaper of computers every week or so, with a message dedicated to educating ransomware/phishing techniques and avoiding them.
 There seems to be a good intention, for this, and I definitely agree, however, what i don&#x27;t agree with, is the way this is intended to educate the end user. 
 You see, the very end user audience that this is intended for has no time to pay too much attention to the text that is on the wallpaper. They are on the clock the soon they enter the premises, and they have to be ready to start working asap. 
 As a company, we have our internal courses for training purposes, and this includes almost every subject that touches the company, and some of those courses are mandatory, even for IT staff like me.
 However, having this type of messaging via wallpaper, seems overboard to me, and having to file requests to go before CAB, any GPO changes go to CAB no matter what the purpose is, for this is ludicrous.
 Time is better spent to educate the users with proper courses, not via a small text on the wallpaper, with horrible colours.
 ​
 So, my fellow professional Redditors, how would you approach this if it comes into your lap? What better solution would you recommend, and what is your general opinion of delivering messages via desktop wallpapers every other week or more?

                              <span>Hi there!
 My company went from around 150 employees to 600 in two years.
 User management is beginning to take its toll on our relatively small IT department.
 We currently have a Microsoft Form that HR submits with the User On- or Offboarding info. Name, e-mail, Department, Manager, Title, Accesses, Licenses etc. We then get this form sent to our helpdesk where we later create the user on-prem which later syncs to Azure.
 There is always something missing, wrong manager, new distribution group needed, additional access/licenses, wrong PC ordered, new start/end date, change of PIM etc,. It takes so much time from us.
 Is there a better way to handle these requests? Any third-party solutions?
 How do larger enterprises solve this? I can&#x27;t fathom them having guys only working full-time with user management (on this level).
 How do YOU do it in your company?
 Cheers!

                              <span>The full data set is about 5TB and it will be split up into sets of 30-100 GB each. Performance of compression / decompression and encryption / decryption is kinda important (mainly because I don&#x27;t want the task to run for 5 weeks).
 Using tools / formats that are readily available on most machines (like zip) is helpful but not a must.
 For compression, it seems zstd is pretty sweet. I&#x27;ve never used it tho. Opinions or alternatives are very welcome.
 For encryption, I usually use GPG, but I&#x27;m concerned about performance. I&#x27;m open to both symmetric and asymmetric solutions.

 I&#x27;m pumped, was a read only user of this sub for some years but I guess this will change in the future :).

                              <span>Hello all,
 ​
 Im curious about how a site-to-site IPsec VPN tunnel works where one end have a public IP and the other end have a private IP.
 ​
 For example, let say on site A: we have a firewall that is connected to a router. The WAN interface on the firewall is a private IP, 192.168.1.1/30 and is connected to a port on the router, and the routers WAN port pointing to the ISP, have a public IP.
 ​
 So,
  
How can we establish a VPN tunnel between the sites and how would the configuration look like? I know for example that on site A, the router needs to forward port 500 &amp; 4500 for IPsec communication. But from site B, what would the peering IP be since private IPs are not routable on the internet?
 And how would the configuration would look like on site A when configuring a peering IP? I think that you need to NAT on site A but my brain just wont let me understand how this would exactly work out when I tried to lab it.
  
​
 Appreciate your help.
 ​
 EDIT: I want to understand how to establish a VPN tunnel between the firewalls, so from site A firewall that have a private IP to the firewall on site B that have a public IP, sorry for not clarifying it.

                              <span>Let&#x27;s say you have 2 3850 switch stacks, A and B, that have a port channel between them, with a host dual homed to each switch in stack a, and a different host dual homed on stack b.
 The hosts need to talk to each other, and each stack is the layer 3 gateway for its respective host.
 How would you expand this to avoid the switch stack as a single point of failure, without the benefit of purchasing any new equipment other than more 3850 stacks.
 Splitting the stacks and connecting the 4 switches together is an option, but now we have a spanning tree loop (that&#x27;s blocked, but still)
 Is there a better way?
 Quick edit, obviously there ARE better ways, with equipment that would support VSS, vPC, MLAG, etc. But in this case, let&#x27;s pretend we only have access to 3850s.

 I have a comware OS switch (C-Sw) that I&#x27;m looking to get started with VLANs but it&#x27;s not going well. Previous config that &#x27;worked&#x27; saw C-Sw without VLANs and connected via single SFP+ to upstream switch (Brocade, B-Sw) and then to pfSense over LAGG. This worked - hosts could ping each other across B-Sw and C-Sw and out to greater internet (if allowed). It&#x27;s unfortunately router-on-stick- model with pfSense doing routing (and I want to change that next phase).
 Next phase config - I want to deploy some hypervisors to the hosts connected to C-Sw and want/need some VLAN support so I can correctly segment client from various mgmt networks. The usual. 
 Approach - I&#x27;ve tried to translate the working B-Sw config (Lagg, trunk ports, vlan membership) across to C-Sw but there is no lo…</span>

                              <span>Hi, we have an ICS network with about 20 switches running RSTP in our DC
 These are basically all access switches, with one of the switches connected to the main SCADA-server which all the hosts on each access switch are constantly sending metrics to.
 Is RSTP recommended here? Is there any other protocol to use? Do you recommend changing the structure to some kind of 2/3-tier topology with access/distribution layers instead?

                              <span>Hi everyone
 I’m currently a senior telephony engineer, my career began in 2015 (I self studied CCNA and whilst studying, took the leap and applied for junior network engineer job and landed one, I did not go university so I have no degree) I stayed at my first job for about 1 year and then moved onto another network role as the colleague I worked with was awful and I wasn’t learning much from him, just experiencing his anger issues at everyone and anyone each day. 
 Second job rolls around and it’s going great until they push me into telephony, aren’t paying me enough but are making me juggle both network and telephony and then one day decide I have to cut out networking and focus on telephony, I then get a call for another telephony job and I go for it as it’s paying more, I get it so I move on.. I stayed there for about 10 months and then I got a call for my current job and I’ve been here for nearly 3 years. 
 Now.. my current workplace are getting rid of all Cisco telephony and moving onto MS teams, no issue there but I’m not feeling any personal development for myself and I’m not sure if I should get my CCNA and go back into networking (also worried about a salary cut as i’m now a mum and I also support my mum financially as my dad left when I was very young) or do I delve into the cyber space as I always had an interest for it.
 My husband is suggesting I try programming as he’s in the field and he thinks, with my background I won’t have a problem landing a job if I can learn and understand it.

                              <span>Fyi- I am pretty new to azure and its SDN setup. But my question is, is there a way to create a default route in azure to send all internet destined traffic to my palo alto vm that is internet facing? Furthermore, is there a way to advertise that same default route and advertise it to a downstream spoke via eBGP, in this case OCI assuming that the eBGP peering is already in place between the two clouds. Would I perhaps need an azure route server , and pass this default route from my palo vm via ebgp, so that azure/oci internet traffic all goes out of the internet interface of the palo vms?

 If I copy a 500Mb file from my computer in NY (local C: drive) to a file share in London, it takes 10 seconds give or take. 
 If I transfer a 2MB folder containing 100 - 12kb files, from the same C: drive to the same network share in London, it’s takes 5 minutes to transfer the files. 
 Any ideas? All are welcome to respond.

 part of my campus a pretty large flex connect local switching deployment, I had a question is a &quot;Flex connnect Roam&quot; treated the same by mobility as a regular L2 or L3 client roam, when a roam happens from one AP to a different ap connected on a different controller?

                              <span>Hey all, I’m having an issue where one computer will intermittently loose connection to another device on my network but I can ping the computer from the device. 
 Example, the main device on my network will loose connection with another device but it I plug directly into the switch on that device I can see/connect with the device that is not seeing the other device.
 Also if I plug my laptop directly into the cat cable on the device that can’t see the other devices I can see/connect to that device. A reboot of the device that is having issues fixes the problem. 
 I should also add that there is no firewall enabled and it’s super intermittent and it’s not always the same device when it happens but every time the only fix I’ve found is to reboot.

 i don&#x27;t know if this question is allowed (Rule #6), but i don&#x27;t get the necessary pieces together.
 I found the following article / documentation for Proxmox which mentioned the use of OVS for SDN deployments.
 Now to my question: How can i route traffic from a specific VXLAN (VM inside of a VXLAN) to the &quot;outer world&quot; such as physical servers or other networks? Or even intra VNI traffic? The best case scenario would be that a firewall could handle all these cases. 
 To be clear i don&#x27;t expect a full-answer to this question. A hint would be sufficient which guides me to the pieces or knowledge i am currently missing.
 Thanks in advance of all people who are wiser and kinder then me ^^
 Regards a Rookie

                              <span>Hi, I have two physically separated networks, one is 192.168.0.0/20 (1G copper) and the other is 172.16.8.0/24 (10G fiber). The 172 network has no gateway out to the internet, and configured manually on the workstation (no dhcp)
 Some clients are physically connected to both (copper / fiber). Machines with 10G cards connect to the 172 network to connect to file servers, and use the 192 to get to the internet. 
 Would connecting these two networks to each other, via a fiber cable from the 192 switch to the 172 switch, cause a loop? Or should I pull the copper from each workstation first? I want to phase out the 172 network, and have the 192 network access 1G and 10G infrastructure.

                              <span>Hello, I work in a logistics depot for a large company that provides laptops/desktops to employees all over the country. Techs remote access these devices and configure them for the users before they are shipped out. 
 Part of my Job duties include making sure these assets are connected to our wifi network and available to remote into, usually between 200-300 at a time. Recently I&#x27;ve noticed that our AP&#x27;s have been dropping assets more than usual and I would like to monitor the devices proactively vs waiting for a tech to inform me that one has lost connection and they are unable to remote into it. 
 I keep an excel sheet with all the assets listed by Serial number and location and I&#x27;m looking for some sort of solution to monitor this list and make sure all assets on the list are pingable and showing connected. I am a contractor and have ZERO access to the access points or wifi network so I obtain IPs by pinging the serial number. 
 This may not be the best place to ask this but I figured it&#x27;s simple enough that people in this group would understand my question and probably know of a simple solution. 
 Also I have a very small amount of technical experience, mostly all self taught for this position and solving my own problems at home. I know some basics, but way less than most of you probably lol.

                              <span>I can&#x27;t seem to find a good answer; maybe my Google-Fu is weak. Due to some provider limitations, we&#x27;re looking at using two firewalls for egress from a specific location and want to make sure that client/server conversations stick to a single firewall. Current plan is to use static routing with IP SLA health checks and set each egress at the same weight. What I can&#x27;t figure out is what load balance mechanism for static routes is used on IOS XE on a Cat9400 or Cat4500. Is it just src/dst IP or is there more to it than that? Labbed in Eve-NG with IOSv and it appeared to be src/dst IP but I don&#x27;t know how to confirm that hardware will function the same way.

                              <span>Hello, i am in a situation where i have been for the past 8 years working in data communication department (not really focused on networking but did projects) also studied CCNA and degree in computer networks. Not that much experience in networking working day to day as you guys do and furthermore I work 4 shifts day, night rest off (good for work-life balance). Our ICT department just split in half NOC and SOC, and head of NOC is vacant. I have always been keen and worked very hard. The vacancy requirements, I full fill them all but I have to start to work 5 days a week from work and, later on, I can work remotely. My biggest concern is my lack of experience, not in a managerial position but in knowing all the systems that they work on. What are your suggestions shall I apply knowing I lack experience and then if I will be chosen I learn along the way?

                              <span>As the title says, I am looking for an unmanaged POE powered switch. I have a POE switch already but I am looking to power like a 5 port switch from this to save on the amount of electrical sockets I need. I saw a few that had this but they are all managed which is not ideal as what I need them for is just purely networking. Advice on this is also welcome.

I&#x27;ve just set an ip for the device as 192.168.0.2 and gateway the same exactly and I don&#x27;t see it within the network anymore. I have no mac address for it and can&#x27;t find it with any scan tool or anything. I can&#x27;t hardware reset it in any way and I had access only via network. It also has an open telnet port 23 that I don&#x27;t know how to use and if I can access it.
 Any help will be really appreciated. 🙏

                              <span>Hello all,
 Hopefully someone has insight that can help me out. We have a relatively simple setup using a C3750 for inband mgmt (that&#x27;s all it does, no high work load or QoS). The C3750 advertises it&#x27;s LAN network into BGP, route is seen job done.
 C3750------BGP-----SSH Client
 |fa1
 |
 | LAN 192.168.0.1/24
 |
 |vme0ACX 192.168.0.2
 However and recently a couple of new deployments are seeing intermittent traffic loss to the end points behind the C3750 device. The C3750 it&#x27;s self remains stable, no high CPU or mem usage. Traffic to it see no drops. Only traffic that must be routed via the C3750.
 Looking at the interface counters we see Xmit-Err and OutDiscards e.g.
 show interfaces counters errors Port Align-Err FCS-Err Xmit-Err Rcv-Err UnderSize OutDiscards Fa1/0/1 0 0 1106 0 0 1106 Fa1/…</span>

                              <span>Hello all,
 The organization I work for is merging one AD domain into a larger domain. I&#x27;ve combed this sub and some forums so I&#x27;m going to answer the question I think I&#x27;m going to get fist: yes we have contracted with a company that has software that does this very thing.
 Here&#x27;s the issue. For as good as this company used to be, it&#x27;s gone downhill in recent years. The support (or lack of) we&#x27;re getting is making us think they have no idea how the tool works. We&#x27;re a small outfit so it&#x27;s possible they&#x27;ve given us less experienced techs, but we&#x27;re still talking about moving 800 endpoints and a lot of files. I&#x27;m getting nervous about using the tool to re-permission files when they don&#x27;t seem to have a grasp on what the tool is doing. I want a backup plan.
 The sAMAccountName is the same in both source and target domain. File servers are located in and permissioned to the target domain.
 Here&#x27;s my question: does anyone have a suggestion for a tool or script that can view the permissions for files in the source domain and add the matching target domain user?
 I&#x27;m more of a bash guy, but I can learn enough PowerShell to get this job done if necessary. I do have a full set of backups should the worst happen.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello folks,
 I am positive I am doing something someone else has done and my google-fu is failing me. I am not a VMware guy, but our on-prem data center is 100% VMware. Today I use packer to build and distribute our new monthly windows images to our azure regions. Word made it to the powers that be that my image is better documented (infra as code essentially) and more consistent than what our on-prem server team is doing. So naturally they decided that I should just &quot;provide the image&quot; to the infra team to use on the vcenters. Problem is I am way out of my element here. I have a repeatable process to get the azure images down as an VHD to the hybrid runbook worker. The problem I haven&#x27;t figured out is how to get them into a format the VMware guys can use. 
 So with the long context out of the way, anyone got any good step by step guides or YouTube video they can recommend to get azure images into vSphere as a template? Or a tool that easily converts VHD files into a VMware vSphere friendly template format?

                              <span>Hey everyone, I ordered a gen 2 T14 with win 11 pro, 11th gen i5, 16gb RAM, 512 SSD 
 It looks like there aren’t a whole lot of differences in the Gen 3 other than the 12th Gen i5 but it’s like $1000 more. Is it REALLY worth the spend to go into a newer generation of processor? I’m open to extra spend if it’s justified, but I’m drawing a blank other than it’s slightly better performance. 
 These laptops will be for standard users who mainly just run office apps and PDFs so not power users or anything. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Anyone else out there relate to this? Mid-sized company, 350-ish employees and the finance team absolutely insists that I put everything on our damn company credit cards rather than cutting a check or ACH. Critical services like telecom, the AWS bill, other cloud services, literally everything.
 They also won&#x27;t let me use terms billing with vendors like Amazon, because you have to pay those invoices with a check, so I get to reconcile dozens of receipts separately every month.
 I&#x27;ve tried arguing against it, citing the PITA that ensues every time there&#x27;s suspected or actual fraud on the card and I have to get a new one, or when we&#x27;ve gone over the company limit and my card is just dead for 2-3 days. But oh no, &quot;this is what management prefers.&quot;

                              <span>After months of complaints, I think my company is finally going to bite the bullet and get a new VPN after realizing Meraki&#x27;s VPN was not designed for WFH. I&#x27;ve been fiddling with a bunch of products and would love to hear any real world feedback on what folks are switching to for VPN. I have a small office network but most stuff in AWS. 
 So far, I&#x27;ve been recommended:
 - Twingate: most often recommended in my circle and I use it for my homelab. Super easy to use and nice integrations. Curious to learn from anyone who&#x27;s ran this in production at their company.
 - Cloudflare: eng team uses their CDN so easy to tack-on for their VPN product. Finding it pretty gnarly to set up and maintain and generally seems like a half-baked product. Anyone using this?
 - Zscaler: friends who work at bigcos use this, but honestly seems a little overkill. Sales process to even get a trial to POC was a pain, but seems very full featured. 
 - Tailscale: lots of people use it for homelab, but haven&#x27;t found anyone who uses it for their company. Generally doesn&#x27;t seem serious for businesses (most of those same people pointed me to Twingate to compare). Any one using it for their company?
 Have looked at a bunch of others as well, but shortlisting the above. Looking for some real world feedback.

 &quot;Support&quot; teams are clueless. Customer service is completely absent. 
 The first response is often a generic request for information that was provided in a ticket.
 Reactions to basic questions like &quot;You&#x27;ve collected logs, how and when should I expect to receive an update?&quot; make it seem as though I&#x27;m speaking a different language.
 Tickets go into black holes, and I have to call and speak to a supervisor to get something as basic as a status update.
 Seriously - speaking as someone that manages a support team, the people managing these teams should be embarassed to go to work.
 Am I alone here or have things seriously gone to shit?

 God forbid such an important figure degrade himself by submitting a ticket with the rest of the plebians, so he goes right to the CIO (who is naturally a subordinate under the finance department for the company). CIO goes right to my boss...and it eventually finds its way to me.
 Now I get to work with CFO about this (very high priority, P1) &#x27;issue&#x27; of random hotel guest Wi-Fi sometimes not being the best.
 I&#x27;m so tired of having to drop everything to babysit executives for nonissues. Anyone else feel similarly?

                              <span>Do you leave the Windows firewall enabled on workstations and servers? Or do you just have it enabled on workstations or servers? We currently have it disabled across the board via GPO but I am in the process of enabling the firewall internally. I&#x27;m just not sure if I want to enable it on servers. Seems like a disaster to have to whitelist every port that&#x27;s being used.
 UPDATE: Thanks everyone. I obviously knew what the answer was going to be but wanted to bring this to management to prove that this is an issue. This network was inherited and the org definitely has a lot of &quot;if it ain&#x27;t broke, don&#x27;t fix it&quot; mentality.

                              <span>Howdy! 
 We have multiple servers that ~70 staff use daily that I would like to migrate to drive.google.com given the age of the equipment and the recent string of hard drive failures ... but after asking everyone to pair down to the current data versus legacy we still have many department folders that are over the 400,000 items/object limit 
 Since a shared drive can contain a maximum of 400,000 items/objects ( including files, folders, and shortcuts) I&#x27;m not sure what to do ... also given the large quantity I&#x27;m concerned about how well the Google Drive for Desktop application will work (everyone uses macOS and some computers are 5 years old)
 Through discussion, staff have agreed they can split out the files they don&#x27;t need constant access to e.g. an &quot;active archive file server website&quot; and could access via a different site/service or similar but I&#x27;m not sure what would be a good service to support split access and doesn&#x27;t cost a fortune. Looked at Backblaze B2 but its not really built for that. Google cloud storage supports the idea of it but is expensive and still isn&#x27;t really designed to be easily browsed like a filesystem. Certainly Dropbox or similar services could work well ... but we&#x27;re duplicating systems and costs then which seems silly. Management suggested just start new on drive.google.com and keep running the legacy servers but that doesn&#x27;t fix the issue of the old, failing equipment.
 In a perfect world there would be select folders that you would stream to Google Drive for Desktop and then others would only be available at drive.google.com but that doesn&#x27;t seem possible like it once was in older versions? Thought about setting up a separate Google active-archive user that staff could login to but with 70 people and changing staff that seems cumbersome at best. 
 Any suggestions?
 Thanks!
 -Adam

                              <span>Hi,
 Backupify was driving me nuts,
 I just switched to AFS last night, they backed up my 100GB mailbox in 5:06 minutes, insane speed.
 They gave me option to choose datacenter which I could not find with other solutions, this made compliance easy for one of our domains has to be in Canada due to healthcare rules.
 The interface is clunky, but the speed and cost are amazing,
 I wanted to go back to spinbackup due to the search/discovery and security features for multi-domain environments (I find it cheaper then enhancing and building policies in multi-domains), but their prices seemed to have doubled in the pandemic and the multi-domain is complicated.
 AFS seems to hit the multi-domain part well, I got various licenses at multiple entities so getting a solution where everything is under one hood is nice. I have some domains with Gsuite+M365 and others that are just Gsuite and some just M365.
 Anyways the setup and configuration took me about 25 minutes, I set it all up myself and have all my sites / teams / mailboxes etc... all backed up now and I am saving a few hundred bucks a month which I will use now to setup some other compliance tools.
 I am still searching for a solution that has a faster and easier interface to run searches across multi-domains / platforms (Gsuite/M365), right now I use an expensive tool and its a pain in the bum for the queries, if anyone knows of a moderately priced solution like AFS I am interested. I have to run searches for PDF&#x27;s and the content within PDF&#x27;s regularly, which is why I sync things to google drive as they have ability to search PDF&#x27;s.

                              <span>The firm I work for has a small residential site in a rural area in the UK (South/West Wales). From the looks of it there&#x27;s no chance of anything other than 3mbit ADSL via the phone line or less than ideal 4G using an external antenna. There&#x27;s no altnets in the area and leased lines are looking at £800/month which isn&#x27;t really feasible.
 However, as this site will need to provide public and staff internet connectivity we will need decent bandwidth (say up to 80mbit download), so we&#x27;re looking to use starlink to provide this.
 I was wondering if anyone here has used Starlink for this kind of fixed site job and had any information regarding reliability and ease of configuration? My main worry is being able to use my own router/firewall if the supplied unit doesn&#x27;t have the features we need. Also does anyone know if the &quot;domestic&quot; tier has any acceptable use limits?

 I have added two reg kids which say are supposed to disable rebooted and as soon as I open up chrome incognito is running. I did what was suggest in the GPO after installing the latest Chrome admx, and still does the same thing, days later too.

                              <span>I&#x27;m using Windows Server 2019 as a host with a few Mellanox Connect-X 6 LX cards. I&#x27;ve created a vSwitch with SR-IOV enabled.
 I&#x27;ve used VMNetworkAdapterVlan -Trunk to pass a number of VLANs to the SR-IOV enabled vNIC in the VM.
 I&#x27;m using a nightly of VyOS and have an extremely simple single interface config for validation. I am able to use tcpdump and see tagged traffic coming in on the parent interface.
 But I am unable to get traffic out the NIC tagged. Is this a limitation of SR-IOV in Hyper-V? I have been down so many rabbit holes with VF security and MAC spoofing and filtering and nearly all information is targeting KVM not Hyper-V.
 Has anyone been able to get guest VLAN tagging through SR-IOV?

 All of the hardware I am testing this on is Windows 11 Capable with TPM enabled, including my own one, a laptop with a Ryzen 5700U, 32GB RAM and TPM 2.0 enabled with the recovery code backed up to AD.
 To double check its compatibility, I ran this &quot;Hardware Readiness&quot; script on the two devices I anticipated being Windows 11 compatible, and both provide the same &quot;Capable&quot; result below.

 I know how to do it normally so I can manually go and install the updates on all the machines. But I would like to know if there is a way to set it up to download, install, and do no restart the machine. This way I can tell the person in question to restart his computer every Thurday morning when he comes into the office.
 Any ideas?

 I am not worried about making use of company devices for personal purposes, as this is easily covered by a policy. 
 I am thinking of tools like network sniffers or vulnerability scanners that are normally acceptable on system administrators&#x27; devices, but may occasionally be required by someone else to troubleshoot specific code projects etc...

                              <span>Good Morning,
 Hopefully someone can help as I&#x27;ve run out of ideas.
 I have an old tenant and a new tenant. Both are using Microsoft Purview Encryption&#x27;s &#x27;Encrypt-only&#x27; option within the Outlook desktop client.
 If old tenant sends an email to newer tenant, the new tenant can read the email natively within the Outlook desktop app.
 If the new tenant sends an email to the older tenant, the old tenant has to go to Outlook on the web to access.
 Bits you might want to know.
  
Both using Exchange Online
 Both are using Microsoft Outlook for Microsoft 365 MSO (version 2208 on new tenant, version 2209 on old tenant).
 I&#x27;ve tried doing this manually via the Outlook client and via DLP, but same experience.
  
If someone has an answer or guidance, I&#x27;d really appreciate it.
 Thanks,
 Max

 After performing remediation on the vulnerabilities listed on Scan_VM_Report, the vulnerabilities are not detected anymore, but we can still see the vulnerabilities detected on snycr file.
 Also, there are other vulnerabilities on Scan_Report_QCA file. I&#x27;m kind of confuse on the three files.
 Responses is greatly appreciated.

 slapd[1574077]: conn&#x3D;1154 fd&#x3D;11 ACCEPT from IP&#x3D; (IP&#x3D;0.0.0.0:636) slapd[1574077]: conn&#x3D;1154 fd&#x3D;11 closed (TLS negotiation failure) slapd[1574077]: conn&#x3D;1155 fd&#x3D;11 ACCEPT from IP&#x3D; (IP&#x3D;0.0.0.0:636) slapd[1574077]: conn&#x3D;1155 fd&#x3D;11 closed (TLS negotiation failure) 
 Here are the permissions for the CA files,
 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root aaple.ca.crt -rw-r--r-- 1 root root aaple.crt -rw-r--r-- 1 root root aaple.crt.bck -rw-r--r-- 1 root root aaple.key -rw-r--r--. 1 root root aaple.key.bck 
 I haven&#x27;t done any configuration changes before restarting the service, and I don&#x27;t know the exact root cause for this failure. Please help me with this.

                              <span>Are you aware of this breach? 
 Yesterday, Dropbox admit a breach in which their 130 code repositories were exposed to attackers and revealed that it happened by phishing emails impersonating CircleCI, a code integration and delivery platform. When I came across the news, I found that 
  
A few thousand names and email addresses of Dropbox employees, current and past customers, sales leads, and vendors were exposed. 
  
On October 14, the account got breached by the attackers through a phishing campaign impersonating CircleCI. The phishing link redirects employees to the fake CircleCI login page and asks for their GitHub username and password. Also, they are asked to pass an OTP using a hardware authentication key. 
 How threatening! Please remember that

                              <span>So I have a domain with 5 servers in it run in HYPER-V. 2 are DC&#x27;S the other 3 have dedicated functions (fileserver, print server, software server). All of the servers are running the windows time service is this correct? Using w32tm query on the primary DC I see the NTPServer is set to time.windows.com however the clocks on all servers and workstation are continuously loosing time a few minutes every 6 months or so. I&#x27;m not sure what exactly I should do here. If I adjust the time manually on the DC it will change the time everywhere else but why is it continuously falling behind? Note I have replaced the cmos battery on the physical server just to make sure it wasn&#x27;t coming from there.

                              <span>At a university, I use to work at we installed over 150 APs around the campus. Many in a mesh with the AP hanging on a pole and powered by solar/batteries. All the switch gear, the routers, and the wireless bridges are also Ubiquiti. After 5 years I replaced 3 APs. I was out there yesterday and some of the same APs are still running 8 years later (I had to go look at it and do the whole &quot;I installed this years ago&quot; routine to everyone).
 We have a mesh with over 300 Unifi APs in the small town I live in and other than the occasional dickweed that tears one up there have never been any issues.

 ​
 I am currently working on a ticket. Our customer has dell optiplex 3000 wyse clients and they want to use a webcam in there rdp session.
 ​
 The wyse client does see the webcam and under device manager on windows the webcam is picked up. Howerver it cant be used.
 Things I tried:
 - Reinstalling drivers for the webcam
 - usb redirection set in wms using 0xvvvppp format
 - usb redirection is activated
 ​
 I am completely at a loss at the moment. Does anybody has any ideas?

 ​
 For debugging purposes, I do not only need to see, when a tool does start a network connection. I also want to see, when it is terminated/finished.
 ​
 Are you aware of any possibility to log &quot;Network connection closed&quot; with sysmon or any other tool additional to &quot;Network connection detected&quot; on Windows systems?
 ​
 Thank you for your help

A solution was posted that said you could turn off whitelisting by typing -Djenkins.security.ClassFilterImpl.SUPPRESS_WHITELIST&#x3D;true 
 The answer was marked as solved by the OP. This is probably the solution for my problem, The only question i have is, Where do i type the command?

                              <span>Is it so alien to some people that we are not backing up local data? We put so much efforts into security and file servers and cloud and give them the best and easiest way to share\work and do their job efficiently and safely with daily\weekly\monthly backup yet they keep working locally and save stuff on desktop and when the disk getting corrupted or they are absent for months and we need to repurpose the workstation for something else they are angry I can&#x27;t restore their local files. I am the only sysadmin at the company so I basically in charge of the entire IT of the company, I sends weekly reminders for right way to work whether it&#x27;s about security stuff\ suspicious mails and not working local. Every time a new employee goes through clearance for the first time, I open a personal folder for them on the network and explain to do all their work from their because we backup daily and can restore if something happen, they can share it with each other and manage it very easily . I send mail and map it as a network drive for them. What else can I do to make someone understand this very simple concept?

                              <span>Dear r/sysadmin
 I was givin the task to implement S/MIME. Yet, never done that before.
 I know that after some research, that every E-Mail Adress needs to be signed for encryption.
 We have roughly 150 Clients which just need to communicate to a single entity (some gov. agency). Altough the plans are to expand that in the future.
 Now I&#x27;m not sure what to do, we do not have a S/MIME Gateway (yet) and all we have atm. is an Exchange OnPrem (2013 , Update soon) and Outlook 2013/2016 on our Clients.
 I&#x27;m not sure where to start and where to go from here.
 &gt; Purchasing S/MIME Certs and distribute them on all of the Clients
 &gt; Letting a internal CA create User-Certs and use them to sign and just send the other entity the root CA.
 &gt; Implementing a S/MIME Gateway (NoSpamProxy?!) and hopefully Implement it smoothly.
 I am a bit over my head here and every guidance is more than welcome :)
 Thanks!

                              <span>We currently have a VNG for IPSec connections back to two of our on-prem data centers and just stood up an ExpressRoute VNG to a vendor&#x27;s network (same region). While BGP is working great for our IPSec VNG, how do I go about taking the BGP routes I&#x27;m receiving on the ExpressRoute connection from this vendor into the rest of our Azure environment?
 Trying to get the routes to propagate like our other BGP routes do from the IPSec VNG.
 I&#x27;ve tried setting up a peering from a VNet to this VNG but the routes don&#x27;t advertise.
 Sorry, kind of new to Azure routing..

                              <span>Is any one in here familiar with the ShowCollector Python script that is available for running show commands on IOS/NX-OS devices utilizing netmiko and Python? I am extremely novice to the Python world but was recently assigned a task of doing data collection on around 100 IOS switches so it’s not very feasible to manually SSH to all of them and run show commands, nor should it be. I need this done by the end of the week which is why I am trying to use this script that’s already published as I know I won’t have time to learn from the ground up by then.
 Anyways, I am not having issues running the script, I am able to run it fine and it “works,” but the account I have for access needs to pass the enable password which this script doesn’t account for, so whenever it tries to create a new file using the host name via ‘show running-configuration | i host name’ it just ends up not naming the files with a host name like it’s supposed to, and overwriting them because I can’t view the running config with my account. I have been trying for a couple of hours to modify the code to allow the enable password, but I just can’t seem to figure it out. I was able to create a very basic script and use net_connect.enable() which worked for passing the enable password, but was only ran on one device and didn’t export the output to a file which is needed. After I was able to get that working, I tried adding that bit and the enable password into the ShowCollector code in multiple different areas, but ultimately couldn’t get it to work, and now I am stuck on where to add the parameters which is why I am here lookin to get some pointers/ideas on where to look! 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve come across some inconsistencies across vendors on how RSTP and RPVST interact and was wondering if anyone else deploys both to the same device or if you just default to RPVST.
 For context I the device is a 100G access switch(Arista) for some devices in research cluster. This device carries only a couple of VLANs. Management, node management, node uplinks(LACP) are pretty much it. I have both turned on ATM and see no issues but I&#x27;d rather take my chances. It will eventually become a dual switch setup in MLAGs if I ever get the sister switch delivered... T.T

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m not sure which sub best fits this question, but I&#x27;m trying to determine what this device is that&#x27;s on my network. I first noticed the device when I added the new VLAN to my HP Aruba switch (SW02) and it grabbed an address from DHCP. Trying to determine which port it was plugged into, I ran: show mac-address on the switch and it showed that the device was connected to the trunk port, so I SSH&#x27;d into the switch that the trunk port runs to (SW01) and ran the same command, it came back showing that the MAC was attached to port 3 which is the trunk port that runs to SW02. I&#x27;ve checked for the MAC on every other switch on my network, as well as DHCP for all VLANS, the only place I can find this MAC address is on SW02 trunk port, and SW01 trunk port that runs to SW02.
 Device details …</span>

                              <span>I am working on a fail-over for a 2nd campus that normally gets its internet from our main campus via a site-to-site fiber link. We want Campus B to be able to fail-over to a new local ISP in case the site-to-site fiber goes down. 
 Please look over the basic diagram:
 https://imgur.com/a/nmMNkDW
 ​
 The SonicWall NSA and ISP at Campus B are new additions.
 We want all Internet to go out Campus A unless there is a break between campuses, then Campus B can fail-over to its ISP.
 OSPF is in use for sharing routes about various VLANs hosted on the L3 switches and the NSA at Campus A. 
 The NSA at campus A does not inject the default route into OSPF.
 I was initially going to just add a static route to the Meraki Layer 3 switch at Campus B with a metric to make it 2nd choice, but it can&#x27;t set a metric for a static route.
 Should we inject the default route from the NSA at Campus A into OSPF, add NSA at Campus B to OSPF, and inject its default route and set that as a lower priority?

                              <span>I recently learnt about the Transmission Control Block, or TCB, and I&#x27;m wondering what this means when a packet is actually forwarded from a computer&#x27;s NIC or how do we use TCB and create.
 Example, Initially, as soon press enter, that the time we will build the packet which include the source(From DHCP or Static), destination (from DNS), and port information. however, the TCB also manages the connection at this point and we get the TCB/Socket information similar on how we build a packet.... So, could you please confirm that we first build the TCB that holds the socket information before actually forwarding the traffic to the nic? Is it possible to connect this during the layer-by-layer processing of the packet in the OSI representation?
 Per research, we can say TCB is the Netstat? 
 Sorry if my question is confusing, but I simply need to know how important TCB and how packets are processed with it.

                              <span>Hello fellow network nerds! :-) For many years I have been helping to send out RIPE Atlas measurement probes (world&#x27;s largest open Internet measurement platform) in the US - initially a few hundred as IPv6 deployments happened. There are currently ~1,400 active probes in the US. But with some newer ISPs there are gaps that would be cool to fill - initially newer ISP connections like Starlink and 5G fixed wireless (TMo &amp; Vz). (Next year maybe some rural FTTH ISPs.)
 In my day job[1], I just renewed our RIPE Atlas sponsorship which gives me another block of probes to deploy. If you might be interested in hosting a probe on your connection, I am guessing I will have probes be able to ship them in about a month (given the upcoming IETF meeting starting this weekend). Once you receive a probe, it connects to your network via Ethernet and you will need to use the RIPE Atlas site to activate the probe – which is about 5 mins work.
 If you might be interested, please PM with the following info: Your first &amp; last name, your shipping address, and your email address for probe activation process.
 Don’t know what RIPE Atlas is? See https://atlas.ripe.net/ 
 Thanks! Jason
 [1] Day job is at Comcast where I work on Internet measurement and new standards and lots of other good-of-the-Internet sorts of stuff. This RIPE Atlas system is run by RIPE NCC - all I am doing is facilitating distribution of probes in the U.S. Here&#x27;s a somewhat recent paper I co-wrote about Internet measurement: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3372135.

                              <span>I am trying to confirm if running a GRE Tunnel from a c8000v within azure can be successfully terminated to an on-prem c8500, via expressroute. I spoke to my azure consultant/sme to check if this was possible and he said he is doubtful that it is but he has been wrong a few times in the past with what is possible and what isn&#x27;t, so I do not want to take just his word. I have also done some research and I read that GRE is not supported in azure however I wanted to further vet this to be true before crossing this out as a possible option to enable an overlay for direct ebgp peering between my on-prem c8500 and cloud c8000v. Has anyone had any experience in deploying this, or is this even feasible? 
 Any comments/advice or know docs are much appreciated!

                              <span>Let me start with we are an Aruba and HPe environment. We also have an ISP Switched ethernet for 19 different sites and it is in working order. I have been in my position in charge of the network for the last year, I know enough to keep things running.
 However the ISP is dragging their feet on getting us information regarding information on when they can setup the Switched Ethernet line at a new site (this is just information).
 Sadly the current new site has a limit on time to be up and running (11/14/2022).
 My boss wants a &quot;point to point&quot; setup from the new network to ours. I was researching on a VPN pptp from our layer 3 to the current layer 3 in house, however, I find that the Aruba 2920-48G J9729A cannot do this.
 With that said, can I get some suggestions on how to do this?

                              <span>Does anyone work in this sector, particularly designing, implementing or administrating infrastructure in space? Is it the same as on the ground here or are things done differently in spacecraft? Would the topology be the same on say Mars compared to Earth? I was having this conversation with some of my colleagues today. I guess this is a sector that cloud can’t really take over…. right? 
 The inner kid in me feels like it would be such a worthwhile undertaking to be apart of.

                              <span>I have a building automation system using a hardware cellular VPN and it all resides on 192.168.1.1. I have over 300 static IP controllers on this network. Now, we want to use the network of our office to provide internet to our BAS instead of the cell service VPN. The problem is, our office network uses 10.1.1.1. Am I going to have to change the static IP of all our BAS controllers for them to be able to communicate to the network?

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve got a couple of buildings where a couple of people complain about their wifi getting slow or not working at all. They say more people experience the issues periodically than are reporting it. 
 I&#x27;ve exhausted any logs from network equipment that might shed any light on this. 
 Basically looking for a tool that I can throw on a micro pc and leave in a closet. Connect to wifi. Then see a history of ping times, speed tests, and whatever other network statistics it can throw at me by date/time. 
 This way I can deploy these to trouble spots and maybe find some data to back up the claims so my NOC will actually listen to me.
 I admit my google-fu has been weak here. 
 Anyone have any suggestions?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I found a contractor to run cable from my building&#x27;s MPOE where ATT trunk/ciena resides to my unit a couple floors up. Now we have two path options and I&#x27;m not sure which is more ideal so would like some perspective on best practices:
  
  
Path 
  
 1) Run in conduit from MPOE to a shared telco/electrical closet (one on each floor) then terminated in a splice tray/patch panel (not sure correct term) and then from closet down a zig zag hallway (drop ceiling) into our unit where I imagine it ends up in another termination box/splice try before being handed off to ATT BGW320 gateway with pigtails. This is the longer run of the two, but I guess more modular as the cable has more sections/splices.
  
 2) Second option is ran in conduit from MPOE through a shared stairwell straight to…</span>

                              <span>Hi, 
 Fairly new to SDWAN. Regular client has QOS policies across all their LAN switches which is typical when using MPLS to help preserve voice/video traffic etc.
 With SDWAN, my understanding is that the devices will identify the traffic type and will do its own prioritization without the need to specifically mark traffic as EF on the LAN.
 Can you help me understand this please?

                              <span>I&#x27;m facing my first software upgrade on a 9800-L, 16.12.2(s) to 17.6. I&#x27;m primarlily an Aruba engineer, and not too familiar with the IOS XE series from Cisco, although I have some battle scars from the 2500-series.
 I&#x27;ve read the documentation, and while it&#x27;s very informative, I struggle to find answers for some of the basic principles. 
 My main question is wheter the AP&#x27;s require dedicated software images loaded, or if they will pull their software from the controller image named C9800-L-universalk9_wlc.17.06.04.SPA.bin. My understanding so far is that during an upgrade to new major release, AP images are included in the controller software.
 The other thing I&#x27;m questioning is which upgrade procedure is the most safe and efficient. I&#x27;m reading about SMU, hitless upgrade, ISSU etc. The customer does not have N+1, just a single controller. We have planned maintenance, so I&#x27;m not bothered with hitless upgrade etc. Should I just upload the .bin-file, select &quot;INSTALL&quot; mode and run the upgrade - that&#x27;s it?
 ​
 Appreciate any helpful advice!

                              <span>Mods, if this question isnt allowed please let me know.
 So I recently started a job as a network analyst (with no prior experience, but I&#x27;ve been taught some aspects and self taught with guides and a lot of google). I&#x27;ve noticed lately users keep letting me know their internet is dead, which is odd. Every single time this has happened so far (3 times) the vlan in my switch is showing a vlan that hasn&#x27;t been in use by this location for a long time. Is there any reason a switch would &quot;default&quot; or change the vlan on the running configuration without a user&#x27;s input? Obviously it&#x27;s not a big issue for me to change the vlan and watch the connection spring to life, but if there is something I&#x27;m missing I&#x27;d like to start getting ahead.

 I cant find any examples or anything when searching for it. 
 What I need is change the subscriber from one VRF to another after Radius Accept.

                              <span>I recently saw an example of a pcap capture which shows an HTTP GET request to a legitimate .com TLD which was seen in the ‘Host’ header of the capture. However, I also noticed the ‘Referer’ field was to an unusual, possibly malicious .xyz TLD. 
 Do this mean the http GET request does not actually connect to the .com TLD but rather the malicious .xyz? I’m a bit confused on what the referer field is implying. 
 Thanks for any insight

                              <span>Work in the non-profit world, State funded. All of our switches have been EOL since 2017, ASA firewalls just went EOL. My manager isn’t in on buying all new hardware. She has the, “it’s working, why change it” mentality. How can I tackle this? Or do I just say okay, wait for it to shit itself, then move from there? 
 Disclaimer: We do have money to buy the equipment. We actually get tons of cash thrown at us from the state. Anything 5k or less is just an expense and written off. So I see no problem

I don&#x27;t put a lot of effort in, so maybe that is part of it, but I haven&#x27;t gotten many replies, despite being a senior sysadmin. 
 How big of a deal is it to fluff your resume? I don&#x27;t mean outright lie, but add a bit more than is technically truthful?
 Additionally, how often to you look at college vs no college? 
 I&#x27;m really pointing my career to Systems Engineering, rather than systems administration, so I was wondering if College is a big decider there.

                              <span>Hi r/sysadmin,
 We had our internal root CA certificate expire and it broke our NPS setup. We renewed the root CA and Windows clients are able to have the WiFi work if they get a gpupdate/force over a cabled connection but unfortunately, clients cannot get this over the WiFi. 
 Does anyone know how I can get a fix for this outside of creating another SSID or cabling all laptops to get a gpupdate with the new root CA. Is it possible to pull from the older expired cert and fix it?

                              <span>Our company has been down for a day and a half now thanks to a network issue with our IP phones (I won&#x27;t say the manufacturer, lets say there is a problem with My Telephones and leave it at that)
 It&#x27;s not with our network, it&#x27;s not with the telephone reseller, it&#x27;s a problem with the cloud providers internet routing. The engineers are working on it at the moment.
 Back in the old days of copper, even if the phone system was down, we&#x27;d still be getting phone calls on the main number where messages could be taken by receptionists and emails could be sent to people asking them to call certain customers back.
 Say what you want, I still reckon copper lines were more DR proof than IP phones. I miss copper telephone lines.

                              <span>Any recommendations for a router or l2/3 switch that can route a symmetrical 1 gbps line speed? I have a Aruba switch that can pass traffic from port to port at 1gbps, but when I use it to route I cant get above 400mbps. I have read other manufactures have the same problem.
 I am looking to simply route my lan traffic to my ISP hand off and vice versa. . Not interested in any software features except basic routing on the device. (Firewall does all the heavy lifting) 
 Ive seen ubiquiti, microtiks, and others noted. Any models or other brands I should look at? Not intrested in PFsense as i dont want any servers to deal with. Just small devices with a little onboard flash. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Our manufacturing branch is always asking to connect manufacturing automation equipment to the network. Because 99% of time the automation is not even remotely secure we keep it air gapped and use sneaker net. The is very inefficient.
 I&#x27;ve talked to some of these automation companies and it seems they have no incentive to create new automation controls.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m hoping someone can cast some light on what might be happening here in the Forwarders section of our DMARC reports:
 https://imgur.com/a/2H8JSy7
 It looks like well-known spammers (AdVids with their many domain variations) are somehow using our DKIM to pass DMARC alignment for their spam emails via Google forwarders. If so, I&#x27;m concerned about potential impact on our reputation, as well as how the heck that could be happening in the first place.
 Our DKIM keys for the 2 affected selectors are 2048-bit through Microsoft 365 and have been rotated 2 weeks in a row, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have affected this spam delivery in any way.
 We do also receive spam from these very domains, but when I look at the headers they&#x27;re all passing their own SPF/DKIM for their many domain variations, with no mention of our domain in SPF/DKIM.
 Any thoughts or insights would be very welcome, thanks.

They have been excellent helping me get comfortable in my new role as a solo &quot;IT Manager&quot; and monitoring our security and backups. The issue is they all work remote up and down the east coast. Besides a visa gc any good ideas that could be delivered via email and redeemed. Wonder if Total Wine has something. Any ideas would be much appreciated.

 It feels like we are trying to jump through a ton of hoops just to avoid using something that&#x27;s an industry standard, and the justifications just don&#x27;t make sense. It comes across as &quot;we know better than everyone else&quot;
 I&#x27;m a junior here so I can&#x27;t really say much but, have any of you encountered this? How did you handle it?

                              <span>I thought I&#x27;d share some key points from a talk I did on Shadow IT as it&#x27;s most often the sysadmins that have to battle with it.
 Tackling shadow IT is a never ending battle. You need to be vigilant and always looking for improvements.
 It&#x27;s a human problem if your company hires humans you have shadow IT
 Decreasing friction and improving the relationship between the service provider (You) and users is the most effective way to minimize shadow IT
 You need to understand what exists where through mechanisms that can&#x27;t be bypassed. Instead of importing your excel sheet of NetBIOS names into an asset inventory tool, scan all your IP ranges. You will be shocked by how much unknown stuff sits on your network.
 Tools like WDAC and App locker are great if your just starting to tackle the problem.
 Don&#x27;t villainize your self by snapping at users you catch with shadow IT. Understand why it exists and what you can do provide an appropriate alternative.
 Because your always going to have Shadow IT take a risk based approach and tackle the stuff those poses the most danger even if it&#x27;s easier to remove that weird app Janet in finance uses.
 Once you have a strong understanding of what&#x27;s in your consistency explore more &#x27;heavy handed&#x27; technologies like Network access control. You can use these technologies to mitigate while you solve the problem.

                              <span>So we received some marketing junk from Dell, but honestly it&#x27;s really cool. Came with a biometric padlock that will never get used as they are all a novelty. The cool part is this: https://imgur.com/a/qcL0JBH It came with this cool timer thing that actually has a little spiny countdown thing.
 The cool part is that although they are only using a small (3 inch) percentage of the screen, it&#x27;s actually a 7&quot; LCD panel with a little control board, battery, speaker and magnet switch: https://imgur.com/a/F7rm9Bt
 Unfortunately I can&#x27;t seem to find any info on the screen or the board (they do have numbers, but my google-fu couldn&#x27;t find anything) as I would love to &quot;hack&quot; this any actually repurpose it! Maybe throw my Nagios map on it. Anyone else get one of these boxes? I would show a pic of the box too, but it&#x27;s... a little torn up lol.

 I could use this apparently, but I don&#x27;t know what &quot;parserr&quot; is and if its 3rd party or not.

                              <span>I need to make sure the details for each individual SIM card subscription are updated with the name of the person who the SIM is issued to. 
 In order to do this I need to find out the SIM details of each device in our organisation (some are voice and data connections, some are just data connections) so that I can then make sure the right name is assigned on our SIM provider portal.
 Is there any way to do this with InTune? Or will I have to manually collect every phone and inspect the SIM? 
 Thank you

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been having Teams crashes on Windows 7 since mid last week.
 Version 1.5.00.28567 crashes with &quot;A javascript error occurred in the main procees&quot;.
 Our current workaround is to launch Teams.exe from the Appdata/local/microsoft/teams/previous instead the default shortcut which uses Update.exe. This is getting deployed by GPO to users.
 We&#x27;ve tried clean installs, deleting folders and regkeys. Repairs and reinstalls of the C++ redists.
 Is anyone else experiencing this issue, and have you found a solution, or is Teams finally not supported on Windows 7?

Anyone come across any way to do this, so they can only use the internet if they&#x27;re on the local wifi, or if there is any other way to lock them down until they reconnect to the staff wifi? And yes I know, this is not ideal but this is one paranoid manager.

                              <span>The last time I had to set up a firewall for a customer with this they went out and bought an internet plan without telling us, ended up getting sold on the 10x more expensive &quot;dedicated internet&quot; and we had so much trouble configuring the WAN as opposed to regular cable/fiber service. The provider gave two WAN schemes and were insistent upon having to use both for the service to work, referring to one group as the &quot;LAN&quot;. I researched dedicated internet for some time and realized it is innately different than the usual internet service with shared pipes. 
 This was months ago but am seeing more events of customers signing up for this and then passing the buck to IT and it only being a problem once the cutover happens and nothing works as expected. The last thing I remember in first example was the provider suggesting I set up my &quot;LAN&quot; with this public scheme and basically NAT traffic from one scheme to the other to show outbound coming from their &quot;WAN&quot; scheme. 
 If not obvious already I feel I&#x27;m clearly missing something here: can anyone chime in on best practice to get this working as expected? Have set up countless networks and helped facilitate cutovers for businesses utilizing static WANs before, but this dedicated internet setup obviously involves more than just the WAN port config and bridge mode modem that had come to be the expectation. How do you configure this firewall side? Do you need additional physical equipment that the provider does not provide?

                              <span>I work at an MSP where some clients are on Azure AD. A common call we receive is a user having account problems with their O365 applications. The apps either don&#x27;t sign in properly or the apps state it&#x27;s a license error.
 The resolution is very simply for us. We go into &#x27;Access Work or School&#x27;, select &#x27;Info&#x27; on the account, then scroll down and there should be a red message by the sync button stating the user needs to sign in to resolve an error. We re-authenticate and the problem is resolved.
 How can we implement some preventative measure for this issue, and/or make it so the user is given a prompt to re-authenticate when there is a sync issue. I know it&#x27;s such a simple process for us to navigate to Access Work or School but I feel like we could cut down the number of these type of calls.

                              <span>Just got promoted from PC admin level 2 to net admin level 2. New title is a little misleading as I won’t be doing much net admin stuff, more like Junior Sysadmin stuff. I’ve waited 14 years for this. Any tips on how to not fuck up?

                              <span>Hi All, 
 Have a change planned to add a few extra OUs to our Azure Sync through Azure AD Connect. We&#x27;ve had a number of 365 accounts be deleted and have realised after a bit of digging it&#x27;s because only limited OUs in our AD are syncing up.
 Process is fairly easy and I can&#x27;t envision any issues - however just want to triple-confirm (as can&#x27;t find any documentation that mentions it). If adding additional OUs (not removing any) - and a full import on the directory is performed on next sync cycle - will there be any outage or change expected for current users in 365?
 (Azure AD Connect -&gt; Customize syncronization options -&gt; Domain/OU Filtering -&gt; Sync Selected Domains and Users -&gt; Select all additional OUs)
 Being overly cautious, however figured it wouldn&#x27;t hurt to hear from somebody who has done this also, for peace of mind.

                              <span>Hi all, what antennas do you use for your LTE routers? I’ve been using taoglas guardian series, and they’re great, but I’ve found that their prices are a bit steep for what you get.
 Usage is on cradlepoint IBR series routers, only need for LTE (wifi disabled), the small router attached ones are not usable for my installations since the routers sit within steel boxes that acts pretty much like a faraday cage.

                              <span>We have a small Citrix AD environment, coworker retired and made me an admin of it. I haven&#x27;t been in it in awhile as there hasn&#x27;t been any problems and I never set my account for password to expire. Well my password expired and I cannot get in.... I normally RDP to the domain controller from there and make changes/create accounts as needed. The laptop I currently work on, is off domain from our actual domain and the Citrix domain. So my question is how do I get into the domain?

                              <span>I screwed up and updated the PCL6 type 3 driver for our Canon printers on our Windows print server to a newer version. Now nobody can print to the printers unless they update the driver first, and nobody can update the driver because they aren&#x27;t an administrator. Is there a way to push out a new driver version to all Windows 10 clients centrally without having to touch every laptop one at a time (with an admin account)? I&#x27;ve been out of the print management game for years (due to the pandemic and nobody being in the office) so I have completely spaced on how this is done. Thank you in advance!

                              <span>We are going to be re-IPing one of our datacenters and have an older NetApp SAN there that we need to change IPs on. The management interface seems straightforward, but there&#x27;s an SVM that we aren&#x27;t sure is actually in use...and if it is, it looks like we have to blow it away and re-create to change the IP scheme on it? We only have one production VM left on it, but blowing the SVM away is a little disconcerting. 
 - Do I actually need to blow away the SVM and re-create it to change the IP?
 - How can I tell if the SVM is actually used? There is traffic on the NICs assigned to it, so I&#x27;m guessing it is used, but some other proof would be nice.

                              <span>There are a few users who are getting bitten with the “my account is locked out every morning” bug. We’re hybrid, the account in O365 is fine when on-prem is locked. The usual tools and logs always point to bad password. User always claims it’s entered properly. Users are mobile, and the problems seem to occur on boot or waking up. OS is Windows 10.
 My current theory is that these lovely (/s) USB docks may be delayed in registering to Windows and identifying keyboards. And in that delay possibly the password, while being typed, isn’t keying in all the characters. Netwrix lockout auditor, DC event logs, etc, never show logon events from any other workstation, so I don’t believe it’s anything malicious. Our helpdesk is done with the problem, so it’s a sysadmin issue now. 
 My insane idea is to throw a keylogger on one of their laptops and capture what’s being typed when they have this issue. In order to see if I’m right about mistyped passwords being the culprit. Because I have a feeling if I call Microsoft, I’m going to be pissing away $500 and months of my time arguing with the level 1 crowd, and going nowhere. 
 If anyone has any other ideas, I’m game. 
 Sorry for the long post.

 This morning I have a user yelled at me that they used to work as a graphic designer 20 years ago so I need to give them local admin rights to their corporate computer so they can download some shady software that they don&#x27;t want to disclose.
 I have to question myself. I am a 5 feet tall 100lbs Asian woman that looks 10 years younger than my age and work in a field that mostly for men. Is that why people think they have the rights to argue with me about how I do my own job? My boss told me not to take it personal but I can not help not to :(. I have been in IT for 3 years and have ran into this a lot.

 Sorry for the morning rant guys and ladies!!

                              <span>Hi everyone, my last role was two years ago as a vCIO and then I funded two businesses that are still going on but I don&#x27;t want to be in them anymore. I realized I can&#x27;t do the constant remote, the 13hs a day... I just can&#x27;t. 
 I&#x27;m an introvert, I like to think, strategize and implement. My background is in network security mostly and I like that a lot. I used that knowledge and some people skills to work selling equipment, and even though that is not what I love and where I thrive, I can do it if I need to. I quickly learn IT products and can explain how they work. 
 I went to a trade school, studied engineering, dropped out, and went to business administration while working at Net. Sec. - I like the IT world, I&#x27;m passionate about security and privacy but I also like the processes and structures where I can create a place for teams in businesses can work and can have success in what they do. I always jokingly called myself the architect of my businesses because I can easily connect or relate all the software, systems, and processes to make sense of it for the business and find ways to leverage all of them. And now I realize that&#x27;s kind of a career as well. 
 I would like to do something with my business experience and I was thinking Enterprise Architecture could be something interesting. I don&#x27;t want to go back to configure firewalls or anything really. I could sell, but I rather not. 
 Has anyone of you jumped and moved laterally like me? What&#x27;s your experience?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all, I have noticed that google meet doesn’t cope with a closed lid on MacBook Pros regardless of MacOs version and hardware specs. Even a webcam with a builtin mic, keeps switching between macs mic and the webcam. From the fact that MacBook blocks microphone when the lid is closed. Please share your experience if you’ve had this issue

                              <span>Hi, I need to rejoin a bunch of users to an AD domain (domain controller is lost and they haven&#x27;t another one). 
 I never used Profwiz, which I believe is the correct tool, and I think I have a very basic question: I will need local administrator account on every workstation to be able to switch profile? I am asking this since I don&#x27;t think users will know their local password, probably I will need to reset them first. Thank you

                              <span>Hi, generally I use the original putty, and I open several sessions in screen when working on Linux servers. Anyway I found a bit annoying switiching between panels, I&#x27;d prefer to use some solution like SecureCRT to open multiple session to same server and easily switch tabs.
 ​
 SecureCRT is great since it allows to rapidly switch between sessions with Alt+1, Alt+2, and so on.
 MTPuTTY looks ok, but it seems can only allows to cicle between sessions (previous/next), it doesn&#x27;t allow to switch to session X for example.
 What your favorite tool, if you use any? Thankyou

                              <span>Now, we&#x27;ve all had issues with spam E-Mails.
 Be it a non-CAPTCHA&#x27;d PHP E-Mailer on an old web-server or the daily LinkedIn Bots messaging you with corporate propaganda, we all get bad mails from time to time.
 ​
 However, one of the worst feelings I&#x27;ve had experienced in my company is realizing that 90% of the E-Mails we send out land in people&#x27;s spam folders. We do not send out bulk E-Mails, each Mail is and was handwritten, often included very long explanations and resources that never saw the light of day. That is frustrating.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve found this website: https://mail-tester.com/ which is very helpful in testing whether your E-Mail gets marked as spam and why! You SHOULD absolutely check it out and test an E-Mail just like you&#x27;d send to business partners and clients.

 I&#x27;ve been im a Helpdesk role for 14 months now and want to better prepare for moving into a system admin role. There is so much to learn, what does everyone recommend I focus on to build a better foundation?
 For context about were I feel Im at skill wise I set up new users with AD, handle most of the day to tech issues, do basic server work, like connecting ports and sorting out tape back ups. I maintain VBS scripts for deploying signatures and printers (but couldnt write my own). And I&#x27;m trying to study the new server architecture and learn powershell currently.
 I&#x27;m keen to keep learning, but I know the day will come when my boss steps away from taking on the sys admin role and if he feels like he cant rely on me and hires someone else, it would really hit hard

                              <span>There&#x27;s a simple and effective command to remove any empty (sub)directories within a given directory (&quot;dir1&quot; in the example):
 robocopy &quot;dir1&quot; &quot;dir1&quot; /s /move 
 However, it turns out robocopy is removing all the attributes of the folders (R - Read only; S - System; H - Hidden) if any, except A (Archive).
 So, the question is as in the title: is there a way to make the target folders keep all the attributes of the source folders?
 NB any robocopy /DCOPY flags somehow don&#x27;t help here

 After some advice, we have a client that is running an RDS farm, they have users that are licensed for Adobe Acrobat Pro and some that dont.
 I see Adobe have stripped us of installing Reader and Pro side by side, installing Acrobat works until a user signs in and it auto upgrades to Pro, rendering the application useless for everyone that is unlicensed.
 What are other SysAdmins doing here, or can this simply not be done anymore. :(
 Any help much appreciated!

                              <span>I am deploying several PHP websites on the same server. Mostly Laravel and WordPress projects.
 How much of a security vulnerability would it be to use the same MySQL user credentials in each project&#x27;s .env file?
 My guess is that I should use a unique username and password for each database. Credentials which I don&#x27;t actually need to memorize since at the end of the day I always have root access to my databases.
 One project&#x27;s .env might look like:
 DB_DATABASE&#x3D;foobar DB_USERNAME&#x3D;frankzappa DB_PASSWORD&#x3D;g4HEs45m220x 
 Whereas another project&#x27;s .env would look like:
 DB_DATABASE&#x3D;goobar DB_USERNAME&#x3D;jimihendrix DB_PASSWORD&#x3D;t3sy47sd3ts3 
 So, in your opinion, what is the best practice when it comes to deploying multiple dynamic websites on the same server?

                              <span>r/sysadmin patch megathread mentions that TLS 1.0 will be disabled by the 2022-10 patches on 2012r2 devices. This will, if I understand correctly, prevent the Connection Broker service from connecting to the WID database. Microsoft suggest upgrading (!!!) or moving to SQL for the Connection Broker (!!! again) OR re-enable TLS 1.0 (see Remote Desktop service (RDS) Connection Broker or Remote Desktop Management service (RDMS) fails - Windows Server | Microsoft Learn ) but they don&#x27;t specify how to re-enable TLS 1.0
 I&#x27;m asking what the best way to do that is - I believe it&#x27;s a combination of registry keys but I&#x27;ve seen differing recommendations as to what keys are required.

                              <span>Hi there
 I thought that if anyone had the answer to this it&#x27;ll be the r/sysadmin community
 I&#x27;m looking to backup around 2TB of files from a Linux server, I want to upload the files to a storage site &amp; download them later all purely through Linux commands
 I thought of Google Drive at first then quickly found out it has 750GB/day limit on bandwidth
 So now I&#x27;m kind of hesitating about using OneDrive
 What&#x27;s the best storage site u know of that has large bandwidth?

                              <span>Can anyone tell me what would cause a handful of Outlook 2016 clients to use basic authentication when connecting to Exchange Online while MA is turned on for our tenant?
 We had several users lose connectivity in Outlook after basic auth was disabled. My fix ended up being to change EnableADAL key to a value of 1, but can’t understand why these clients were opting to use basic auth to begin with?
 My understanding is that 2016 should default to MA, unless explicitly told to use legacy via registry keys. 
 I’ve been reading/researching for hours now and see a few similar questions, but no answers.
 Edit: a word
 Edit 2: A) is the enableADAL key added to the registry automatically when installing Office 2016? If so, is there anything other than manual intervention that would set the value to 0? If not, how does this key get added to the registry other than manually?

                              <span>Company is slowly expanding into a new location. The facility is huge and has been vacant for a few years now but still maintained (to an extent).
 Thankfully some of the guys from the previous IT team were nice enough to provide any and all of their documentation. I still have a lot to go through but I was immediately impressed by not just WHAT they documented but HOW they documented it.
 This made me realize that while it is widely agreed that documentation is critical it has never been anything I&#x27;ve been taught or even shown how to do. Several times over the years I&#x27;ve felt there were better ways I could be doing my documentation but when trying to research methods or templates I would get nowhere.
 Obviously there is the catch that to show how you format and do your documentation you would have to either censor all of your actual data or take the time to input dummy data. Curious to see how you guys are able to explain or even demonstrate HOW you do your documentation.
 PS - Drink every time I said &quot;documentation&quot;

 What do (if you do at all) use to help aggregate and read these reports? Open source is fine, free or paid just curious.

                              <span>Currently a senior system administrator, and I’m finding myself more and more in a position where things are just nonstop a shit show. I’m trying to work on real life projects, I’m literally designing networks, putting servers together and deploying them for real businesses, and then I find myself caught in a shitstorm of Level 1 Level 2 bullshit tickets. 
 My company does not wanna hire L1’s, so we’re basically a bunch of senior sysadmins having to deal with Morons that can’t Google their goddamn problem. Ticket after ticket after ticket, as projects Pile the fuck up. You ignore it and the customers whine and complain. 
 How do you guys deal with the stress? Because I feel like my health is slowly declining because of my ABSURD Stress levels due to this, and I’m only in my 20’s. The money is great but what’s the point if you don’t get to enjoy it because everyday is stress 9000? 
 Any advice from the wise ones is appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious what the consensus is on blocking emails with a SPF soft fail. SPF is a simple thing that can protect the sender and recipient. I see too many spoofed emails coming in that fail on soft to feel comfortable about letting them all in, but also see too many that haven&#x27;t taken a few minutes to configure one.

                              <span>For those of us in the VDI space, you may have systems users self upgrade and run Windows updates on and you may find that the 22H2 upgrade fails at 8% with a complaint of &quot;Unsupported Processor&quot;.
 You may then check the compatibility list and find your processor on it like I did. You may even find previous reports of the 6226 processor being bugged.
 Don&#x27;t worry your not going insane, the compatibility checker is just broken but fear not you can bypass it with the following registry key. Create the following a DWORD registry with a Value of 1 to bypass this faulty check and allow for upgrading.
  DWORD: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Setup\MoSetup\AllowUpgradesWithUnsupportedTPMOrCPU 
 Hope this helps someone else save a week of their time.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I don’t do social media much so sorry if my post super stinks but I’m grasping at straws with this.
 Got a 300-400 user environment with multiple DCs. This morning the entire company got locked out of their accounts from the AD. Logging was turned on and the 4740 ID shows that everyone was locked out by account: DomainController$ and the call computer is “?”
 There were no Bad passwords logged.
 It’s in a hybrid 365 environment and azure ad does not see anything related to these lockouts.
 Anyone have any leads on where to look for a global lockout?
 Thanks for your time :)

                              <span>My IT org is pushing hard to get ISO 27001 certified and I’m all for it, but I’m having trouble figuring out wtf that even means.
 I’ve seen the 2013 and 2019 revisions and I can’t seem to find any good references to what the IT org is asking for. All of the ISO stuff looks very generic and non-specific.
 For example, IT org says we need keycard entry into the server room. Ok great we have that. But to me it looks like the point of ISO is that you create a policy, you test it, and you stick to it. I don’t see where I’m ISO it say you need keycard access. The policy of my company doesn’t say you need a keycard access either.
 So is the gap that my company doesn’t have a policy that says you need keycard access or am I missing the something?
 EDIT: I’m just a cog in the machine trying to understand a high-level view of the process. By no means did I intend to imply I was managing this project or writing policies.

                              <span>I work for a financial company and about a year ago, our security team put a policy in place to forensically image every computer used by a previous employee. We use various cloud platforms to back up the important stuff, but they set this up to get every thing on the local machine “just in case” 
 It is incredibly time consuming and in constant need of attention or process change due to OS updates or our MDM applying new policies, and that the software/devices perform very intermittently. 
 We use Cellebrite digital collectors (MacQ) for our Mac and Windows computers. Apple is already more difficult to navigate with this, and we still cannot obtain full images from M1 macs. I run into constant issues with the software freezing/crashing and, without any issues, the image can take anywhere from 1-5 hours to complete, so coupled with these issues, I can spend days working on these and make very little progress. 
 Since starting this work, I don’t believe even one file has ever been booted with an actual need to find something. 
 I am having a hard time seeing exactly why we need to have these images. With all the systems in place to record an employee’s work and the machines activity, I just don’t see how booting these images up later can be too useful. When researching, it seems like I am in a pretty narrow use-case, and it seems like there would be better tools and documentation if this was a larger and needed operation. But, maybe it’s the standard and I just have to keep pushing to get this into a good flow. 
 How does your org handle this?

                              <span>Our email signature isn&#x27;t overpowering... but the images in it are often causing annoyances when those who don&#x27;t have HTML enabled cause them to become attachments. I was asked to redesign our standards since they are over 3 years old.
 We currently have:
 Name
 Title
 Logo (300px wide)
 Address
 Phone Numbers
 Social Media
 ​
 I&#x27;d like to completely remove the social media images and just have the website. I am considering hosting the logo on our website, so we no longer have the attachments. Any other suggestions? Is the hosting of the logo on the website not a good idea?

                              <span>I just started my new sysadmin job (finally away from help desk!) and I&#x27;m now responsible for managing New Relic for my company. Both of these apps are new to me.
 I&#x27;ve been getting alerts from one of our web servers having over 80% space used. I checked it out and it looks like that New Relic is currently using up 16GB of logs in &quot;C:\ProgramData\New Relic\.NET Agent\Logs&quot;. I have a feeling this probably isn&#x27;t necessary.
 Two questions:
  
Is there any way to enable some kind of log rotation here? It looks like we&#x27;re using the .Net agent. After scouring the documentation for hours, all I can find is info on how to do this for the Java agent. Is there no way to set this up with the .Net agent? If so, how?
 If log rotation isn&#x27;t a thing for the .Net agent. Would I be safe in archiving (or deleting) most of these logs? Would this effect our New Relic instance?

                              <span>Hi all,
 This is such a niche topic so I apologise that I am trying to find a needle in a haystack here, but I have some Alcatel Lucent 8028 phones authenticating using 802.1x. They send their certificates to my Cisco ISE server, but the certificate chain is incomplete so they get rejected (as they should!).
 All I need is to acquire the root cert for Alcatel &quot;Wired Phones&quot;, but this appears to be much harder than it should be. I have found the below in a forum:
  
The certificates from the Alkatel business portal doesn&#x27;t work as these are not the correct CA&#x27;s signed the certificate of the phone. You have to obtain the correct CA &quot;Wired Phones&quot; from your Alkatel local vendor. 
  
Does anyone happen to have obtained this certificate? And if they have, can they please share it? 
 Thank You

                              <span>I have a firewall and two linux servers. I would like to aggregate the logs in a central location, run some basic analysis to identify potential issues and, ideally, be alerted when issues are identified. I realize a full SIEM implementation is probably beyond my budget and pay grade but would like to improve our logging and use of our logs. My goal is to reduce the amount of time I spend inspecting logs on 3 different machines.
 One server is remote and should connect via TLS, the firewall and other server are on the same local network I wish to implement the log server. I prefer opens source on windows but I am willing to consider a Linux based solution as well. Spending a little money is an option if the feature justify the expense but I really don&#x27;t have a budget for this.
 I&#x27;ve discovered there are a plethora of tools ranging from simple log servers to full SIEM available with a dramatic range in prices. I would really appreciate it if someone could help steer me in a good direction to help me understand what people enjoy using and find appropriate for small environments like mine. I imagine, like in many other areas of IT, there are certain tools that get used a lot and have more active communities. Thanks!

 I have been asked to create a folder to be mapped as a drive for our quality department. The quality department needs to be able to add files to the folder but not be able to delete or edit the files. What permissions do I have to set on the quality security group to accomplish this? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>How does this stuff genuinely get past policies? I dont have any experience in government IT but surely they would have DLP policies and visibilities to stop stuff like this happening? Is it me being naive and theres probably a layer of corruption in there (most definitely), perhaps it was raised internally then dismissed with con consequences?
 It doesnt require expensive software to have the visibility or awareness of an incident like this. Does anyone have some insights to GOV IT and how this was even allowed?

But how do I create a logoff reminder to clock out? Or something similar. Maybe a scheduled task 5 minutes before closing time? The challenge there is, some locations stay later than others due to volume.
 Is anyone doing something like this? How did you do it?

                              <span>I missed the memo about DLP being deprecated in August, and because we&#x27;re a standard O365 org (not E3 or E5) we can only get a 90 day trial of the new version (Purview)
 All I need to do is change the recipient address on some alerts that are set up (I&#x27;ll be changing it to a distribution list instead of named individuals).
 Will signing up for the 90 day trial allow me to make the changes and then forget about it? Or will it all just stop working then? Can it be worked around via Powershell? Am I totally scuppered?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>This is for Macs. Most Zscaler deployment tutorials have you download the .app file and converting that to a .pkg, but it looks like Zscaler has a .pkg file that you can download. I&#x27;ve tried deploying it but it just stays pending for a while before erroring out. 
 Anyone have any luck deploying the app?

 I know there are other ways to go about this, I was just curious if there is a policy to restrict this.

                              <span>Anyone dealing with this right now? MS is turning this off.
 I am wondering if it also affects Connectors. I had legacy clients that stopped working a few weeks ago and the answer was to get the upgraded to a newer Outlook client. And that was easy enough.
 However, I am relaying through a report server to O365. It has worked well. Will this also be turned off?

                              <span>Hello. I got a customer service (mostly phone calls) job 2 months ago, and I want to travel abroad temporarily while being able to work. Here&#x27;s the setup already:
 ​
  
I&#x27;m using VMWare Workstation to avoid pesky/obtrusive software from accessing my PC
 The employer made me install &quot;Remote Desktop&quot;. So now I&#x27;m controlling the VMWare and then again through &quot;Remote Desktop&quot; to access the organization&#x27;s remote desktop.
  
How would I go about working during my trip? They don&#x27;t allow foreign IP addresses or VPNs. Therefore, the only option is to use a remote control desktop tool such as AnyDesk, Remote Desktop or TeamViewer. This would make the entire thing 3 layered:
 Layer 1: controlling my laptop from foreign country with another laptop
 Layer 2: using VMware on my remote laptop
 Layer 3: using Remote Desktop to access their remote desktop
 Any thoughts? I&#x27;ll be testing before the trip to ensure it works, but any feedback would be much appreciated.

 I know you can enable meeting room bookings from outside but it doesn&#x27;t provide the external with the Room Scheduler and I need that.
 So put another it another way; I want to book meeting rooms in an MS tenant I am not a part of and it has to ve user-friendly.

 we have a terminal server with office and a shared computer licence installed. After some kind of bug, office had to get reinstalled. Now after reinstallation I thought that every user needed to have their mailboxes reconfigured with password entry and so on. However every user can access every mailbox again. Are these information stored somewhere in the userprofile, even after deinstallation of office? 
 I would have thought that every mailbox and password would have been deleted but it wasnt the case.
 Thanks for the help in advance

 I&#x27;m using NIST as a framework but wondered if anyone had any pointers or similar Risk Assessments? Needs to be inclusive of risks but not as heavy as what you may find in a corporate environment.

                              <span>Hi, I am currently having an issues on a network with trust relationship issues, some user machines and servers drop off randomly stating a trust relationship error, rebooting the user laptops fixes it an using the Test-ComputerSecureChannel -Repair -Credential works for servers however it is an ongoing issue. I checked the domain controllers I don&#x27;t see any errors I thought it might have been a sync issue between them but I don&#x27;t see that. Wondering if anyone had any suggestions? Thank you

                              <span>One of my managers told me that SCEP/NDES is dead. And we should focus on cert enrollment using another protocol, though he couldn&#x27;t tell me what it should be. We&#x27;re working on renewing network equipment and creating a list of modern applications to replace a lot of outdated stuff.
 Already told him that while I agree that SCEP/NDES is old, its anything but obsolete. If only when using MS ADCS.
 Obviously there&#x27;s modern protocol, next to custom REST API, such as EST, CMPv2 and ACME
 Me and my colleague find it pretty challenging to get a list of known brands/applications that actually still support SCEP/NDES based certificate requests, as well as those that support EST, CMPv2. 
 A lot of CISCO solutions support EST (such as ISE), but hopefully some of you in this community can help me with other applications/network equipment that supports SCEP/NDES, EST, CMPv2?

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Recently took over a site and their VC provider has told us our CVI BlueJeans is coming up for renewal. 
 Currently all our meeting rooms have been upgraded to dedicated Yealink MTR over the last year with no legacy devices remaining. 
 I questioned this as in my mind, if our devices are native Teams MTRs then why would we need a bridge but the response was it is needed for any external parties joining from older devices. 
 &quot; The tenancy hosting the teams meeting must have the tenancy with the gateway. It won’t work if a guest has the gateway.&quot;
 ​
 Is that correct? 
 ​
 thanks,

                              <span>I was trying to cut IP address column from the last&#x27;s output on a Linux machine. But it was somehow not working. Then I remembered I wrote a blog post about Perl one-liners and used a command from there:
 sh $ last | perl -wlane &#x27;print $F[2]&#x27; | sort | uniq  
 This time it worked nicely.

                              <span>Hi!
 Simple domain, server 2016 Standard, about 70 Win10&#x27;s (Pro) - they want bitlocker enabled on all of them (including the DC?) and are spread around several locations (hence why I&#x27;d like this to be silent)
 What is the best way to do this now? I&#x27;ve read that they have taken away the silent-option for non-enterprise editions and I see several PS-scripts on spiceworks and whatnot, but I don&#x27;t know which one is the best one to use.
 And while we&#x27;re at it, is storing the keys in AD the most safe/reliable approach? (Haven&#x27;t done that before.)
 Thanks in advance! :)

                              <span>Due to reasons such as a better overview and security I&#x27;m planning on having two seperate systems.
 One for games and stuff, where for example it can&#x27;t be outruled that from time to time something like a mod gets downloaded from a less trustworthy website. The other one shall be for working and for important as well as sensitive data.
 Windows will run on both.
 But how do I seperate these systems? From what I&#x27;ve read, dual boot doesn&#x27;t really increase safety: If maleware makes it onto one system, it&#x27;s likely to infect all connected partitions and hard drives.
 Does using BitLocker for the respective partitions/hard drives improve security?
 Switches for 2.5&quot; and 3.5&quot; sata-drives exist, but I&#x27;d rather not downgrade from my currently used M.2-ssd.
 Is there any other option than using two seperate computers? How do you handle this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently running three Windows Server VM&#x27;s for a small business running some accounting software. Two of them are D4s v3&#x27;s (4 vCPU + 16GiB RAM), and the last is a B2s (2 vCPU + 4 GiB RAM). There&#x27;s a reservation in place which brings the monthly bill to approximately C$650 (US$476). This is getting a bit too expensive, especially considering that we&#x27;d like to add another VM. From looking at the bill, it seems that the main cost is the Windows Server VM License cost. Aside from the cost, the setup is optimal for the owner of the business as all of the employees can login at once (2 max per VM) and the work is synced through the use of SyncThing.
 ​
 Is there a recommended alternative that we can switch to? Or is this license cost going to exist everywhere? I&#x27;ve looked into it and saw that big names such as GCP have similar price ranges, whereas relatively unknown companies like Kamatera have cheaper prices. I&#x27;d appreciate any input.

                              <span>Hello,
 ​
 I have been working for one year at a company in the medical production business and the business has been growing rapidly for the past years. Last year we doubled in size and now we are about 100 users.
 ​
 I used to be working at a MSP as a consultant doing it all (from fixing printers to setting up servers). Im not great at anything but i have a broad knowlage base to stand on. I worked for this customer and they hired me as a IT-Manager last year. I am currently alone doing everything IT-related for the business.
 ​
 Now they want me to present a 5 year roadmap for IT and as this is a first for me i wanted to get your feedback on whats important to add to the presentation?
 ​
 My first thoughts are 
  
IT-Security withing the company and how to educate users (its almost non existant, before me there was no MFA, no general knowlage about security, no password on the company wifi etc).
 How to reduce costs
 Documentation
 Going Cloud (started to tamper with intune for easier computer management)
  
​
 Everything is helpful :)

                              <span>We are starting up Duo in our enterprise. We rely on Google&#x27;s Single Sign-on to be used with a service already for most of our users. So we use the Third-Party SSO Profile for that service. However a portion of users need to use MFA.
 To do this I set up Generic SAML Service Provider - Single Sign-On, and applied it to the OU where the users will be. On Google&#x27;s side, I also set &quot;Have Google Prompt for their username&quot; on the SSO Profile assignment. If I use &quot;Require users to enter their Google Username&quot;, it doesn&#x27;t prompt for MFA. 
 When signing into Google, I get a typical Google login page. After putting in the username, it then dumps me to Duo&#x27;s login page, prompting me to put the username in again. 
 Is there any way I can change that behavior so that Google passes the account name to Duo so my users don&#x27;t have to type the username in twice?

 We are looking at getting 100M symmetric for one of our sites in Lewisville. Looking at Spectrum and Frontier. They both look similar cost wise.
 Any ideas who is better in these aspects Availability Support Speed to delivery
 Also thinking of a secondary link, any ideas on who can provide best business grade asymmetric internet?

About the top warning one, I never had such problem with it, the first time it appears and the second one in the low part I don&#x27;t know what it means.
 And when I login on Eve website my machines in labs won&#x27;t start up, so I thought it could be a RAM issue, but it can&#x27;t be that because these exact machines always started with any kind of problem and if I give more RAM the virtual machine won&#x27;t start.

                              <span>So i have a lenovo ix2 NAS at work, suddenly for some reason i can no longer access it using its static ip via a browser.
 When i connect it directly with a cable to my work computer i can access it through a browser through its name only, not the ip.
 I checked the network settings, everything is still the same, same static ip, same subnet same everything, web access is also on.
 Anyone got any idea what could be the problem? Is it possibly something related to my network’s firewall?

                              <span>Looking to find documentation on using the same RSA keypair for different CA (trustpoints). I tested it by building ikev2 p2p tunnels and placing both trustpoints in the ikev2 profile and it worked. Also after establishing the connection I removed one of the trustpoints clear the sa session and connection reestablished on the 2nd trustpoint. My question is will it be a ipsec conflict using the same rsakey pair for different CA?

                              <span>I&#x27;m reading a networking book and I&#x27;m stuck on a sentence that suggests a circuit switched network divides its transmission rate depending on the number of connections/circuits. Why does a connection get a fraction of the transmission capacity? This makes no sense to me.
 In the TDM, you&#x27;re switching between circuits, but the speed of the link doesn&#x27;t go down based on the number of active circuits. But I guess you could argue that the transmission rate is reduced since you&#x27;re not sending data when the circuit switched from you to others, so it&#x27;s a if the network is slower, but when you&#x27;re sending data, you&#x27;re sending it at full speed possible by the link. But I don&#x27;t understand why a 1Mbps link is quartered to 250kbps if there are 4 circuits? Or is this saying the same thing I said, it&#x27;s a if the link speed is reduced?
 In the FDM, this makes completely no sense to me. You&#x27;re dividing the spectrum, but you&#x27;re sending stuff in parallel and at full speed just with its own bandwidth. No?

                              <span>Were currently contemplating on renewing our internal WLAN AP. One reason being, making the &quot;conenction faster&quot;. Sure we can do that with channel bonding and maybe thinking about implementing Wifi6 but we want to figure out if our internet connection is sufficient for user experieince. 
 ​
 How would one go about or how would you investigate to see if your internet connection is enough for your users? meaning if X amount of jitter, X amount of ping latency is enough or needs improvement and what not.

                              <span>Hi all!
 Here&#x27;s a bit of a confusing situation for me. I&#x27;m working with a pair of Cisco Nexus 3048-TPs running software version version 6.0(2)U2(2) which were given to me, and I&#x27;m attempting to configure the switches with a handful of SVIs, and with RIPv2 for the dynamic routing protocol (it&#x27;s a lab environment, don&#x27;t worry). I&#x27;m having issues with the behavior of the SVIs / L3 functionality on the switches.
 To start, let&#x27;s assume SVI #1 is for VLAN10 with the subnet 192.168.10.0/25 and the SVI has the IP address 192.168.10.1/25 and lives on Switch #1, and SVI #2 is for VLAN11 with the subnet 192.168.10.128.0/25 with the SVI having the IP address 192.168.10.129/25 living on Switch #2. RIPv2 is used to distribute routes for these subnets across the network. I also have a router at 10.1.0.1…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a direct fiber internet connection that comes in via a media converter as VLAN 35. However, the location where this fiber and media converter are located only has one network cable in that area which services some other equipment already. The simplest solution to pipe the internet connection to the router and firewall (on another level) would be to comingle the unsecured, unfirewalled internet connection on VLAN 35 with the rest of the LAN (that currently doesn&#x27;t use VLANs) on that one single cable. However, that seems counter intuitive. Usually I would prefer to physically have the router/firewall between the internet and the rest of the LAN, and not just virtually. Can VLANs be trusted to virtually separate the internet from the rest of the LAN? Or am I asking for trouble?

                              <span>Whenever I look up the benefits of http3, I see mostly the fast connection starts and the faster handling of errors. However, it seems to me that using udp instead of udp, would increase the speed of downloads substantially. For instance, if your ping is 100ms and your windows size is 32KB, then you are limited to 2.4Mbps to wait for the ack packet to come back. If you don&#x27;t have to wait for the ack packet, couldn&#x27;t you get the full network speed download of 1gbps (assuming that is what you pay for and the server also pays for that upload). That is a huge difference in bandwidth. Am I missing something?

I have 2 in office days and the other 3 are virtual days. Work only takes up maybe 4 hours of my average day, and nothing is too challenging right now to me. My team is about 6 network admins and a manager. Medium size environment. 
 I&#x27;m thinking that I&#x27;m getting bored where I&#x27;m at now. I&#x27;ve been thinking about making a move to something else. I&#x27;m looking at cloud networking, or maybe something virtual like NSX. I&#x27;ve worked with NSX about 5 years ago but I don&#x27;t know how much since then it may have changed, or if it&#x27;s even still something orgs are using. Is there anyone in these jobs who wouldn&#x27;t mind sharing what an average day is? Are you work from home, hybrid, or in office? What&#x27;s the work/life balance in your job?

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 I had searched this question earlier, but didn&#x27;t get a convincing reply. And today i was asked this question and couldn&#x27;t answer. :( Could you please help with specific answers?
 Two scenarios:
  
Area1 &gt; Area0 &gt; Area2 &gt; Area1: Area 1 and 2 have direct connectivity using an ABR. Will Area 1 routes be advertised into Area 2 through the common ABR? If yes, will it cause any routing loop? If No, How will OSPF avoid the loop?
 Area 1 &gt; Area 2 using two ABRs. There is no Area 0. Will the routes be advertised between Areas? If yes, will it cause routing Loops? If No, how will OSPF prevent the loop?
  
I know Inter Area OSPF works like Distance vector (As per many answers i found on other posts), but still not clear how OSPF avoids loops in above scenarios.
 Thanks.

Especially your preparation strategy for the behavioral or leadership questions. Do you just collect and research your stories etc? Do you have a backup plan incase went south and you forget the stories?
 Has anyone in this room not had an offer? What do you believe you can alter or fix to change that?
 What important question should we ask or know with the interviewer? 
 Mind sharing tips in passing ?

Terraform was my next bet but Meraki doesn&#x27;t have a provider. So, any suggestions on a tool/tools to automate/manage my network stack? I&#x27;d prefer to use the same tool for all network gear. I manage 3 sites so consolidating and automating management is ideal.
 I see Ansible looks to have collections for each and they both have python SDKs. Both of those tools I would like to use and learn more of. Maybe a preference of python but I could imagine how Ansible could be better for the job.
 Any suggestions? Other tools to use? Personal experiences? Bummed we leverage Meraki but it is what it is.

                              <span>Hello gents,
 you may find this a funny story, but I started recently to work for a data center provider in Europe. Initially, we were not carrier neutral so we had been trying to resell the internet traffic we purchased from tier 1-2 carriers to our clients as our own service. I mean it works well, as long as the customers aren&#x27;t the smartest ones and are ready to pay for it. 
 As I am one of the most experienced guys when it comes to carrier network (even thought I am in telco and carrier sales for more than 15 years) they now asking me to develop and establish 2 new products.
  
Become a carrier neutral DC
 Develope a Business Plan for a IP transit product
  
Regarding the first task.
 I am fine with it, as this had been my key business my entire career. The challenge is: They want me to offer these services (carrier neutral) only to the new clients, but not to the existing ones. So they want carriers to join, but will not allow them to approach existing customers, which is nonsense. IMHO. Why should carriers join us if they are not able to do their business and with whom? I need to write a business plan for that and maybe anybody has any kind of templates or something I can use, I would really appreciate it. 
 Regarding the IP Transit Product.
 I need to write a business plan and present it - even though, again, I am not a product designer nor manager, I used to be sales all my 15 years in DC Business. But that&#x27;s ok, I don&#x27;t have any choice. So any plans how I can start? 
 Thanks in advance...
 PS: Sorry English is my 3rd language

                              <span>Hi all! My question is about how load balancers work in corporate environments.
 I understand that a load balancer will distribute traffic between backend services, but I&#x27;m not clear on how the load balancer itself doesn&#x27;t become the single point of failure?
 In other words, as the title asks, how do you load balance load balancers?

 I&#x27;m planning to disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1 on all the servers including exchange server. I want to logging for a couple weeks to see what I was in for on F5.
 ​
 How can I do that ?
 ​
 Any other pointers appreciated as well.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently studying for the CompTIA Network+ certification and I&#x27;m reading Mike Meyers&#x27; Network+ 8th edition exam guide. I&#x27;m currently in the last chapter on Network Troubleshooting, on the section ipconfig/ifconfig/ip. He shows an example of the macOS/UNIX ifconfig output, and on the inet line it says:
  
inet 192.168.4.78 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.4.255 
  
I&#x27;m just wondering why does the netmask show in hex and not dotted decimal or CIDR notation? Wouldn&#x27;t it normally be written as 255.255.255.0 or /24? 
 This seems to be specific to the ifconfig output, as ipconfig shows the subnet mask with dotted decimal notation, and ip shows CIDR notation. This is the first time I&#x27;ve even seen a hex netmask, as literally the rest of the book has used dotted decimal or CIDR notation. Even in my limited real world experience troubleshooting computers and networks, I&#x27;ve never seen a hex netmask.
 I&#x27;ve tried Googling the answer, but most of what I found was just decimal to hexadecimal conversion charts, or talking about hexadecimal in a general sense not really networking focused. From what I read I think it might just be a remnant of the early mainframes and UNIX systems, and the language they ran on. But I can&#x27;t find anything definitive about it. 
 I don&#x27;t think it ultimately matters what notation the subnet/netmask are written in, but I am I wrong is there some system out there where I&#x27;ll need to know how to convert binary to hex for subnetting?

                              <span>I have a user who is getting undeliverable email notifications. Looking into it, the email is attempting to be sent from the user, to an x.500 type of address, and then failing.
 Checking the users mailbox, I have found that the subject relates to a meeting from seven years ago, which the user declined. It looks like outlook has started to try and send notifications to the other person invited to the meeting all of a sudden. Several notifications seem to be triggered per day.
 Any clue as to how that may have happened and more importantly where to track down the cause to stop it.
 Thanks for any tips in advance!

 If I get a message reported from users that has a PDF for a Norton renewal (among many other things,) I don&#x27;t even have to look to know that it came from a randomly generated Gmail account. I&#x27;m freaking sick of it and Barracuda is doing a crap job of finding them. Of course, I can&#x27;t just outright block all of Gmail as much as I&#x27;d like to do so.
 This sucks.

 During this time, all these advanced access to portals like azure admin, 0365 administration, switch administration, firewalls, vmware, server administration/patching, citrix server administration, vpn, etc was completely off limits. And just the company culture was that of keeping it that way for people like me.
 So fast forward, company breaks into smaller pieces and I end up as single IT point of contact for all of this. I get the access and surprisingly I find all these things very easy and self explanatory or not something I wouldn&#x27;t be able to find in google and do it.

They are doing fine, but lately they have been extra pushy on getting things that they have partnerships with implemented and most recently, trying to offer assistance with tasks I&#x27;m directly responsible for. We are a small company, and we need the help, but half of me is wondering if they are positioning themselves to get in and replace someone. Am I just paranoid, or do I need to start driving a wedge between them and us? 
 Thoughts ?

                              <span>We had a company come to us for some help with an old Windows Server and we noticed they had a LOT of OpenSUSE VMs. I, as someone who uses mostly Windows and Ubuntu, I asked why they choose it, and they stated they liked the stability and optimizations, etc (I don&#x27;t know how accurate that is because as stated before, Windows and Ubuntu). But here&#x27;s the funny part, this is how they got introduced to OpenSUSE (they were a Ubuntu server room before this).
 https://youtu.be/SYRlTISvjww - Uptime Funk 
 A parody song basically introduced the IT staff to OpenSUSE. They did some digging and eventually completely migrated to OpenSUSE back in 2018. This song is basically the IT department&#x27;s theme song. Thought I&#x27;d share this little fun bit from my day working with a really cool group of IT folks.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m trying to write a PS script which will get a list of all partner tenant names I manage, and tenant id&#x27;s into an array, which will then populate a combo box. I can get a list of tenant id&#x27;s easily using get-msolpartnercontract. But cant get a list of names, which I can add to the array alongside the tenant id&#x27;s
 Anyone have any pointers for me?
 Regards
 James

                              <span>Engineering startup, we are getting ready to buy a new round of computers and thinking about getting rid of laptops and moving to Mac Minis or iMacs for each engineer plus an iPad Pro. The primary reason is that we’re a hardware startup and we want to give people a way to work on the platform without mailing prototype boards around the country. We do have an office and a lot of people do come in a few days a week as well, so we want most of them to have a dedicated area. We were thinking about using static IP’s and Guacamole RDS to accomplish this. Is this a terrible idea? We’re just trying to figure out a way to standardize our builds but not have to worry about laptops with code and PII on them disappearing or if someone’s got a hardware prototype that gets stolen.

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 My company uses GCP and we found the pricing for their VPN pretty confusing. When I was researching a pricing calculator similar to the one u/PFK_Manager made on AWS, I struck out, so I worked with someone at my company to research and create one. If you think AWS VPN pricing is complicated to calculate, Google’s is even worse…
 Here is a calculator for GCP VPN to hopefully save others the trouble we went through. Google’s pricing and documentation was so convoluted that we actually caught some mistakes in their own pricing examples. My summary is below but we also have a full write up here. 
 How Google Cloud VPN Pricing works
 There are three components:
  
A time based cloud VPN gateway charge
 A charge for the number of non-tunnel external IP addresses assigned to a VPN g…</span>

 Does anybody know a comprehensive tutorial on how to read those? seems the reason for high CPU usage is due to the constant queries being done by the computers that connect to that RODC but want to know the reason behind those, any insight?

                              <span>Working with a small network that has Linux, macOS, and Windows systems. * All systems have a system certificate deployed that is used for wired or wireless EAP-TLS/802.1x that works (FreeRADIUS deployed on RHEL8 servers) * Some users now have smartcards that they want to incorporate. * Smartcards work fine on Linux and macOS systems for EAP-TLS wired or wireless * Smartcards fail weirdly on Windows 10 (22H2) with this error in the EapMethods-RasTls event logs:
 &quot;Authentication failed for EAP method type 13. The error was 0x80090331.&quot;
 GoogleFu says that error is something like &quot;The client and server cannot communicate, because they do not possess a common algorithm.&quot;
 Wireshark packet captures of the EAP conversation show the client sending its list of ciphers it supports in the Client-Hello, and then the Server-Hello coming back using one of those ciphers. But the Windows 10 host stops responding and simply says it could not connect when using the smartcard.
 The same host works fine when using the computer certificate and the cipher exchange looks the same in that case.
 Is there a deeper/better way to get Windows to show me more information so I can figure out what cipher mismatch it thinks it has ? Has anyone seen this error before for EAP-TLS ?

 Framework laptop looks like an interesting option but for that price for such a short warranty I&#x27;m concerned that it may not be the laptop that lasts me the next 10 years. But I love the idea of being able to upgrade laptops the way I have my desktop.
 Then there are the HP/Dell powerhouses where the cost of ram/storage is stupid and is not replaceable or upgradeable.
 What would you choose for your next 10 year laptop today?

                              <span>I have a lot of responsibilities besides being a sysadmin. And, like a lot of you I imagine, I’m responsible for the care and feeding of things in a lot of different domains. Some of those domains I have a lot of experience in, some not so much. 
 Because I don’t have the resources or bandwidth to research and test ALL updates for example, I rely on the vendor (or trusted third party) to tell me how critical a vulnerability is to know how soon it needs to be patched. MSFT says there’s a domain controller vulnerability, deploy it to one DC today, the rest tomorrow. I generally don’t try to do an analysis to determine for each vulnerability or update how susceptible we might be. I know I can get burned this way, but I rather risk getting burned by a patch than leaving a known vulnerability in place. I do check reddit to see if a patch Tuesday is particularly rough. Standing on the shoulders of giants if you will.
 I kind of apply this same rule in other domains where I have found best practice dashboards. I know that it won’t find all the problems, but I’m hoping it will at least help us avoid the most common pitfalls.
 Here are some that I use: * AWS - Security Hub, Trusted Advisor * Azure - Advisor * Office 365 - Security checklists (forgot name?) * Microsoft Endpoint Manager - Security Score * Crowdstrike - Spotlight * Custom Dashboards - Grafana, Graylog, misc
 What tools do you use? Does anyone have a great tool for AD/GPO tuneups?

                              <span>Hey r/Sysadmin, hope you&#x27;re all enjoying your weekends? 
 I&#x27;ve recently started publishing M365 related content to help the IT and business communities I serve, and to help me grow as a person / individual. 
 In this video (just under 10 mins) I&#x27;m sharing 10 things you can do to help secure your business using a few best practices, a couple of built-in M365 tools and free stuff. 
 https://youtu.be/8nEjTuFmKgY
 I&#x27;ll be pleasantly surprised if anyone is already doing every single point on this list of topics which I cover off:
 - User Education / training
 - Safe Links 
 - Safe Attachments
 - MFA via Conditional Access
 - Location Blocking
 - RBAC / Reduction of privilege
 - DKIM
 - DMARC
 - M365 Portal Branding
 - Backing up M365 data
 Hope you enjoy the content.

                              <span>I have integrated my WD Mycloud EX2 storage with AD for more secure authentication ( I wanted to disable local users ).
 everything worked just fine and all the users appeard in the WD Share permession console, when I set the permession on a shared folder to Public everyone can access it, but when I specify read/write only to the Administrator account it give me access denied and can&#x27;t access the shared folder.
 does this have some issues between unix and windows permissions?
 what can I do?

                              <span>Is there a way (policy / registry / powershell) to make windows 10 apply a default of &quot;Private&quot; instead of &quot;Public&quot; to any new network it encounters? 
 Or, is there a way to make it stop this nonsense and just use &quot;the network&quot; like windows XP did? 
 I know it&#x27;s insecure for a laptop that connects to everything, but I&#x27;m working with desktop PCs on small networks that don&#x27;t have a domain.

                              <span>Good day,
 The company I work for currently uses signature based Symantec AV. Now, we are looking to change to another product.
 The question is, in this ransomware world, is it necessary now to get an EDR tool as well? I wonder how necessary is it? Big companies like Solarwinds, got hacked and they supposedly would have have all the EPP/EDR tools at endpoint. I wondered the effectiveness of these tools.
 Should we just stick to the usual AV or just really look for EDR?
 Please also suggest some of the best tools out there,
 ​
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi All
 I have a list of provisioned edge favorites that deploys to all staff in our organization. 
 I would like to further deploy managed favorites dependent on particular security groups assigned to users. 
 It seems that you can only have one list of provisioned favorites set, so does anyone else have any sort recommendations on how to achieve this?

 Cheers

                              <span>I have about 20-30 deployed PC&#x27;s all across the country running a custom application as their sole job, and I have very few issues with them. The majority of the issues I do get relate to windows updates or nagging. I run them on a local account, not a Microsoft account, and every few months something will happen where it starts asking to switch to a microsoft account or change all of the default browsers or other settings. The users running the application just start clicking through and it brings it out of the validated state and breaks things and I have to log in and change everything back.
 How do I tell windows I want updates, but I don&#x27;t want any default app, account, or other major changes? Seems like there should be a way to do this, but I am not finding anything good so far.

                              <span>So I was on one of the anitwork subs and crucified for making a comment about how sometimes I ask my wife to help with queries I&#x27;m building. I didn&#x27;t think it was a big deal but they flipped their shit.
 So my wife is a database developer and she knows SQL like a second langue. She can whip insane queries in minutes that would take me days to build (and still be kind of shitty). Anyway, I don&#x27;t do this often but once in a while I&#x27;m stuck on something and just holler at her like &quot;hey, babe can you check this syntax is OK&quot; or I&#x27;m sitting there and she comes in to see what I&#x27;m doing and we end up going over one. It goes the other way also, there have been quite a few times we are staring at her screen chewing over a problem.
 To me, it&#x27;s not a big deal, it&#x27;s fun sitting together and figuring out a problem (sometimes we end up spending the evening &quot;watching Netflix&quot;), and besides, we both benefit from the money I make from the job.
 But to be clear we never sit in the same room when we are working from home. There&#x27;s a fine line between spending too much time with your spouse. lol

                              <span>Devs were complaining about not able to POST to a web service in AWS from a Dev Server in On-Prem when the request had a large body, for two weeks and started blaming the firewall / VPN. Yeah, as strange as it sounds. 
 Today, my team was involved and managed to identify the maximum body size that could be used in that Dev Server: 1.35KB (I was in awe). More than that, timeout.
 I then involved the network team, no issues. Checked Firewall, no issues. Checked VMware, no issues either. So I decided to test the Webservice from other servers (using Invoke-WebRequest) within the same site: worked. Test the WS in the same VLAN: worked. 
 Narrowed to the same dev server. There was no error log, no other issues.
 So I asked. &quot;Hey, have you tried rebooting the server today or in the last few weeks?&quot; (this is a dev server, so one of them have that privilege). &quot;No&quot;.
 Rebooted the server. 
 WS now worked properly.
 WTF Microsoft?

                              <span>I currently have a DFS Replication group configured to sync files between two servers.
 The share being sync&#x27;d exists on its own drive on each server, so data compared on the drives would be 1:1. 
 Data as it exists on Server A (parent share) 1.6TB used (402 GB free on the drive). A few days into replication now and I have had to expand the drive 3 times now on Server B, as it has completely filled up its first allocation of 2TB far exceeding the 1.6TB of data it should be getting.
 DFSRprivate does exist within the the share, however the staging area was allotted 40GB and conflict/deletion area 20GB. So if factoring in that space, there is no way (that I am aware of) for that area to contribute to the extra 600 GB (and counting) of data making it&#x27;s way onto Server B during this replication. Windirstat also confirms only ~40GB of date in there.
 Curious if anyone out there has seen this behavior before, is this common, something I messed up? Any help would be appreciated, Thanks!

                              <span>Hey all, hope you can help me out.
 I&#x27;m a full-time student at Oregon Tech with a full-time job. I am set to graduate soon and need to do a Capstone project. OIT, for some bizarre reason, does not provide project sponsors to students and you are expected to find one in a span of about two weeks. Yes you read that right - you need to find a project sponsor with a Capstone-level project lying around for you to complete on top of managing your established work schedule (we&#x27;re a commuter school). This is obviously insane and thankfully they offer the option to do a research project instead and write about your findings.
 My problem is... I don&#x27;t really know what to research. Specifically, our project needs to bring to light a problem in the world and how we can apply our knowledge to fixing that problem. My focus for my degree was on Network and Systems Administration. I know how networking equipment/the internet works, how AD works, some basic programming, took several business courses, and learned a bit about cybersecurity along the way.
 My original project idea was how IoT implementation can benefit businesses and the security risks with IoT devices. My advisor doesn&#x27;t really like this idea and insists that it won&#x27;t be a big enough topic to fill 350 hours of work for the next year. I worry she may be right, but she doesn&#x27;t seem to be giving me any usable project ideas. 
 Any idea what kind of research project could fit the bill? Something networking/security or business-adjacent would be highly preferable. Thanks for the help, and feel free to ask me whatever.

                              <span>Hi All,
 We run several Dell VRTX appliances with dual nose Hyper clusters. They run great, but we are looking for a replacement. I have been out of the hardware game for awhile and wanted to see if there were any good recommendations from the community for a small multinode HCI appliance that has network, storage and compute options, like the Dell VRTX. 
 Everything I am finding appears to be 1u appliances that are either compute or storage and meant to be scale out for VMware or nutanix. 
 I am sure there are small units out there, if anyone has any suggestions I would be most grateful 😃

 Interested in Ubiquity for price and features, but it seems Azure AD SSO is simply not possible for WiFi auth.

                              <span>Ok so I’ve got Server01 which is part of a replication group. I want to upgrade it to a version of Windows Server which won’t be EoS next year, I want to have minimal downtime and I don’t want to do an in-place upgrade. Also, there’s a lot of data. 
 So I’m wondering what the most efficient way of doing this is. In the past for smaller sites I’ve removed the old server from the replication group, stood up a new VM and added to the group, kicked off replication and waited. I don’t want to do that this time though due to the amount of data. 
 So do I stand up a new VM side-by-side with Server01, robocopy the data, then when I’m ready rename and change the IP of Server01 and put that IP and host name on the new VM? If this is best, do I need to exclude dfsrprivate?
 I’ve also considered adding the new VM to the replication group with a name like Server02 while Server01 is still in production. Then wait for replication to finish, then (overnight) rename, remove from group and power off Server01 and then rename Server02 ‘Server01’. I feel like that’s a bad idea but I need to hear someone say it!
 Or is there a better method that I haven’t considered yet? Any suggestions and/or help is appreciated.

                              <span>Hello and happy Saturday :)
 Over the span of a few weeks now I&#x27;ve been working towards improving our network efficiency and speed as it relates to a few Databases we have over two sites.
 The sites are connected over site to site vpn, thus the traversed traffic has a secuirty packet overhead, reducing the mtu available to 1438
 That number was found by doing ping -f [some-ip] -l 1400 then modifying the number to ensure there was no packet fragmentation, that number plus the 28 bit header gave me 1438, however not the point I just wanted to provide context.
 From there I investigated manipulating the MTU via GPO, I came up empty handed however knew there were other options... Option 26 to be presice.
 I added option 26 to our dhcp server, did a reboot on an end device, a forced release/renew, and the mtu ( checked with netsh interface ipv4 show subinterface showed the same default 1500
 from there I grabbed wireshark, grabbed a capture of the renewal, and the ack does show option 26 with the correct value.
 I&#x27;ve checked the logs within the client however there are no entries or evidence that windows knows what to do with this information.
 so, can you help me with a few questions: 1. why does windows not honour dhcp options, speicifcally option 26? and 2. how would you go about modifying the MTU for client devices?
 ty for taking the time and have a great weekend everyone :)

 I&#x27;ve never really found a good answer to this, other than having something installed into the rack when it was first put together

                              <span>I would be very greatful if more knowledgeable members of this community would help me find some puzzling answers regarding proper disk benchmarking.
 Here is what I have gathered so far:
 High queue with small block size based on median of files stored on the server usually 16KB-128KB
 Random not sequential read/write depending on read write stats in my case usually 95/5 read/write for web files and 80/20 for database. 
 Fsync on, system memory (ram) cache disabled directly in apps used in my case database ( buffer in mysql disabled ), web server ( file logs disabled ), language parser (in case of php opcache file timestamps disabled, error log to file disabled ), any logging and monitoring apps disabled
 Block sector of disk during formatting anf filesystem is equal between tested drives.
 Fill system memory loaded to the 99% to make sure os especially linux doesn&#x27;t use ram as cache for file operations. Swap file disabled.
 Also because duplicated files in linux are referenced not physically duplicated try to make unique files.
 Also always check extreme parameters like 100% read or write workload or test very small 1KB or 1GB to avoid lags when for example somebody decides to upload big file or put this file as a blob to the database. 
 Analyze data in a statistical manner. When parameters are gradually increased look for linear or logarithmic spread of the results to ensure disk performance is predictable
  
Is there anything more to know when benchmarking disks to choose the optimal one ?
 
I&#x27;m wondering if apps for automatic tests like webdriver io imitating concurrent users in not so random fashion should be used beside the usual fio and sysbench i use ?
 
I know that linux filesystem is little different due to points I mentioned earlier, is there anything else worth knowing in this subject which may affect the results of benchmark disk ?

                              <span>I was assisting an end-user yesterday as he called for some random issue on his computer. Had him on the phone for about 10 minutes and said he didn’t need to be on the phone while I fix this so I would call him back. We hang up and I see him working on his computer (obviously I can’t work while he’s working). I message him twice - once on the app and again on Teams to say only one can work on the computer at a time - no response. An hour and a half passes before he says “sorry, let’s reschedule for tomorrow at 2”. I say fine and call him and 2PM the next day on Teams - rings once and stops. I figure he’s on a call and rejected my call or my call just didn’t go through so I message him - no answer. I was contemplating going upstairs to my main PC where my kid was (I was in the garage) but decided to stay to see if I could reach him. I call him again 10 minutes later and he says “meeting went over - 10 minutes?” This is when I hear my wife yelling my name because my baby fell from the bed about 2 and a half feet asking me if we should go to the hospital. The part that’s pissing me off is this end-user who #1 didn’t have the common sense or listen to me when I said I’m going to work on his PC and to leave his shit alone, #2 I’m trying to baby sit this end-user because he wasn’t courteous enough to give me a heads up that he was late earlier. I feel as if I could’ve helped my son if it wasn’t for this douchebag.

 I am sure it is possible however I have not fully looked into the it yet, however with a few brief searches I couldn’t find anyone who has set up a NPS and CA server joined to an AADDS domain via the site to site VPN tunnel?
 We are fully cloud and a requirement has come up to implement unique logins for our WiFi &amp; VPN. We are using Microsoft AAD as our identity provider. Plan is to also implement 2FA for our VPN by leveraging the AAD MFA extension for the NPS server.
 If there are any other solutions people have for this - please let me know!

                              <span>Hi,
 Im looking for a cheap solution on how to license users that dont have computers/phones from work. 
 They need access to 3 different system (salary/schema, intranet and a third webbased application) from their own phone (or home computer), i think i want to use the same IDP for federated access so they get SSO. 
 I was thinking of using Azure AD + Microsoft F1, but i dont really have the budget for that.

                              <span>As anyone ever seen Windows Server OS upgrade itself? I was under impression that this had to be done manually. I know how to check regedit to see when OS was updated but does anyone how I can to see how the server was upgraded or is that even possible?
 I have RDS server that was upgraded from WS16 to WS19 and we don’t have licenses for RDS 19.

 I am looking for a cheap RFID antenna and fobs for our keys. Our drivers constantly take our vehicle keys home with them.
 My idea is to have an RFID antenna over the door so that a chime plays and to tell them that they are leaving the building with company keys.
 Does anyone use something like this currently. I looked at the anti theft antennas that stores use but that seems to be an overkill for what I need.

 I am working to start a small rural ISP and am trying to better understanding of carrier scale routing. My background is in the physical infrastructure side, and I would like to have a good quality rough draft before we start .
 ​
 https://imgur.com/a/yRteSjS is the diagram I&#x27;m working with. The use case is, we have 10 small communities where we&#x27;d like to provide FTTH.
  
We will have two edge facilities. Each edge has 3 routers.
 Each community distribution site will have a link back to each edge facility. The pair of routers at a community will be in VRRP (or HSRP if the router has it).
 The goal is to be a native IPv6 environment. We will have one ASN.
  
Can eBGP, iBGP, and/or OSPF be used to implement a multi-home multi-path load shared environment as diagrammed?
 Given we will be IPv6 native, what would the best practice be for handling IPv4 bound traffic in this environment?
 ​
 Thank you,

                              <span>Help with network setup for small business
 Hello,
 I am a software engineer but I don’t know a lot about networking hardware. I would like to have an idea of what needs to be done to setup a network on a 3 floor building for a small business.
 There will be 26 computers connected through Ethernet (wiring is already in place), and approximately 50 concurrent wifi users, so I guess I’m going to need to place an access point on every floor for wifi.
 There is a small IT room, where I’ll place the router, switches, camera DVRs, etc… though currently I haven’t bought any of the hardware, just the Ethernet wiring from the IT room to the computers.
 Another thing I want to plan for is a possible internet failure, since internet connections in the area are very unreliable, I want a backup fiber connection in case the main one has problems.
 So basically I would really appreciate some guiding regarding a good setup for this. Budget is approximately $3000.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hey! I just put a pair of S5224 switches in a VLT stack in production. The config isn’t anything out of the ordinary, some L3 vlan interfaces and some L2 interfaces. 
 Before I went live with them I had no issues with slow logins on SSH (like 2sec to get in after entering pw) and our observium was polling snmp without any issues. 
 Now however the sign-in takes 80-100sec and they stop to respond to snmp polls once every hour. The network however works 100% fine. If you ping any interface on it I don’t lose a single ping. Cpu hovers around 10% and memory around 40%. 
 Anyone experienced this issue before? I’m running the latest os10 10.5.4.3.

                              <span>I have an architecture question and was hoping one or some of you networking geniuses could help me out. 
 I am implementing an architecture where agnostic front ends will send backend requests to load balanced reverse proxies. The complication I am facing is that each backend is individual to an organization, so each backend will be spun up in its own environment (containers), but the routing BETWEEN the front end and the organization’s specific backend container is where I am having trouble. 
 The simple solution that comes to mind is to use a header and implement some sort of header-based lookup to obtain either IPs or DNS names to route to the correct upstream. I feel like there’s a million and one ways to do this but I feel like I’m missing the “right” (simple/robust/scalable) way to do it. 
 The goal will be to deploy agnostic front ends as needed based on load, and then auto deploy a backend/middleware-with-lookup-table/updated-proxy-config for each organization that joins. 
 Have any of you solved this type of routing issue? Am I missing something to simplify this process? Any help is appreciated!

Physical side of things is all done and prepped but we are trying to figure out the best way/approach to migrating what rules we want from our ASA&#x27;s to Palos. I&#x27;ve looked into migration tools but haven&#x27;t really found anything yet that I can start from.
 I&#x27;m guessing people here have done this many a time now, what has been your best way of doing it?

 First I would like to apologize for my English, I&#x27;m from Brazil and I&#x27;m using the translator.
 We currently use in the company Aruba Instant On for Switch, Unifi for Wireless. We are going to move to another building and with that came the opportunity to improve our infrastructure. Our company is considered average here in Brazil, we work with road infrastructure works and at the office we currently have 80 users with a tendency to grow. There are about 200 devices. Now are my doubts.
 In the above scenario, does Aruba&#x27;s Instant On line still serve us or should we think about Aruba Enterprise? For wireless we intend to migrate to another company considering that Ubiquiti does not have support, which one should we consider for our case?

 I noticed the high prices IPv4 Provider Assigned is going for these days but no Provider Independent IPv4 is offered. What price range would IPv4 PI space go for these days?

                              <span>For context I am following this tutorial: https://youtu.be/0EklBDIZSgc (timestamp 3:30)
 It is VMWare running Windows Server 2019 with a Bridged Adapter.
 In the video he configures a static IP address of 192.168.50.201 based on his default gateway 192.168.50.1.
 This is an example of a setup I have tried: https://i.imgur.com/8WPDA1G.png
 Since my default gateway is 192.168.0.1 I assigned a static IP address of 192.168.0.201 (I have also tried various other numbers on the last octet in case it was some weird conflict issue, as well as typing exactly what he did in case I was missing something) but upon validating my network settings I get this:
 https://i.imgur.com/0r1IzaL.png
 And this is the ipconfig:
 https://i.imgur.com/cjuWRyZ.png
 And when I try something like ipconfig /renew or /release I get the following error: 
 &quot;This operation failed as no adapter is in the state permissible for this operation.&quot;

                              <span>We&#x27;re trying to build a budget server which is essentially a power workstation that will be occasionally used for building golden images on as well as some other script/deployment dev and testing.
 One of the more affordable HDD options are the 1.92TB 400-AXSD , which are marked as &quot;Read Intensive SSD&quot; when you get into the quote.
 We&#x27;re considering putting 4x of these in raid10
 What is the overall performance of these drives like, are they equivalent to consumer sata SSDS when it comes to write speeds or are they substantially slower when writing data?

 Just noticing the recent spate of recruiters. The complaint has been, steady as rain on the rooftops during monsoon season, that recruiters don&#x27;t read. Fair enough. I did set out to make my resume easily readable and answer 90% of common questions. But the past 6 weeks has been tip-tappier than normal. It seems that these recruiters must hear you say it, on the phone, before it will register across the screen inside their minds. Only about 10% is recognized on the summary page when they skim despite being spelled-out in short bursts.
 I try my best to help them by telling them upfront that most of the base information they need is on the first page. Furthermore, I try to get the basics out of them before committing to a …</span>

                              <span>Most of you will have figured this out or already knew it.
 There are some who are just running into this because they haven&#x27;t enabled modern authentication on a tenant. If you have found yourself in that situation; I hope this may be of help to you.
 I may have missed it in documentation, but the following were not obvious to me as a newbie to oauth2, and didn&#x27;t come up in the searches of the forums:
 You do need to have ssl enabled bindings
 While the redirect URL does not have to be publicly resolvable, using loopback fails on machines other than the server itself for obvious reasons. To use a non-loopback URL, ssl must be enabled. Self signed works.
 There are two separate Microsoft guides on osTicket&#x27;s site, one for SSO (portal) and the other to enable an email fetch. It is easy to confuse the two via search terms.
 Good luck.

                              <span>I am trying to copy from a eSATA enclosure holding a 4TB HDD with some (okay, more than some, ALOT) bad sectors. I&#x27;ve tried running a check disk but it never completes, I&#x27;ve resorted to trying to robocopy everything off of it using the command;
 robocopy 4TBDRIVE:\ \\NETWORKLOCATION\SAN /MT:1 /r:0 /w:0 
 I&#x27;ve been able to get some files off, but robocopy keeps getting stuck on certain files, obviously ones with bad sectors. I haven&#x27;t figured out a way to get it to skip these and move onto the next if the percent copied doesn&#x27;t move in say 1 minute ... it just sits there forever, until I stop the copy, go into the disk, delete the file and start all over. There is about 2000 files I need to copy off so I am hoping that there is a better way.

 Has anyone seen issues since the October updates?
  
&quot;Because of these additional protections, domain join operations are intentionally prevented from re-using an existing computer account in the target domain.Domain join operations will be blocked automatically after installing the October 2022 security updates on client computers due to additional security checks before re-using an existing computer account (the changes do not affect new accounts).
  
I assume since most people&#x27;s &quot;golden&quot; images are a little older (e.g. most recent updates aren&#x27;t slipstreamed), and most domain-join operations occur during imaging before the OS is patched, this might be going under the radar.
 More from the article:
  
This happens unless the user attempting to join the domain does not have the appropriate write permissions (i.e., the user is the creator of the existing account or the computer was created by a domain administrator).Microsoft explained that domain join processes might intentionally fail with &quot;0xaac (2732): NERR_AccountReuseBlockedByPolicy&quot; errors saying that &quot;An account with the same name exists in Active Directory. Re-using the account was blocked by security policy.&quot;&quot;Affected scenarios include some domain join or re-imaging operations where a computer account was created or pre-staged by a different identity than the identity used to join or re-join the computer to the domain.&quot;
  
Hopefully this isn&#x27;t as dastardly as it sounds...?

                              <span>I recently began a new job at a company of 350+ employees with what seems to me to be an exceptionally large infrastructure for what the company is and its size. Perhaps I&#x27;m just very green, but we have about 300 production servers with all the apps and services that run on them coming to about 500+.
 I&#x27;m a new Sysadmin straight out of college with some internship experience and a little bit of freelance as well as personal home-lab setup. However, I&#x27;m a little overwhelmed by the size of what I&#x27;m getting into with this job. I&#x27;m very excited, but I am unsure on how to best go about just getting an understanding and layout of the IT infrastructure. My team is about 3 including myself and while they are happy to answer questions, it&#x27;s unreasonable to ask them to sit-down and talk me through each server and what it does. 
 Do others have any tips, tricks or suggestions on how to just familiarize myself with the infrastructure?
 I&#x27;ve been given the job of building out a Zabbix server for monitoring purposes and that seems to be a really good way to start as it will force me to become familiar with everything. However,it is also hard to figure out what to monitor and how best to setup useful alerts if I don&#x27;t know the infrastructure.

I was inherited a broken network and I&#x27;ve been fixing things left and right on it over the past few weeks. Come last Friday I was working on using PSWindowsupdate PowerShell module and I noticed that I was unable to traverse registry remotely. So me being the dumbass that I am not thinking clearly I implemented a registry change to give the server admin group full rights to the entire HKLM registry as well as the HKCU. Now, I really fucked up by overriding some of the registry keys permissions so I&#x27;m having all kinds of services not able to start and I&#x27;m have to manually remap the service with the registry key.

                              <span>I was recently reminded that not everyone learns FC troubleshooting in their sysadmin careers. I thought I&#x27;d post this here for future reference in case someone needs.
 The guy that taught me everything fibre channel gave me a list and order of troubleshooting steps. I have tried to reconstruct them here. As this was 10 years ago, it may not be 100% what he said, but I think it&#x27;s pretty close.
 troubleshooting FC:
  
host (initiator) HBA driver
 host HBA status
 switch port for initiator
 cabling to initiator
 zoning connecting the initiator to target
 cabling to target
 port on target
 LUN to port mapping
 port security
  
Start with 1 and go to 9, for all things able to be checked remotely first, then check physical. 3-7 can be checked partially with one step, checking the switch to make sure they show links. This excludes 90% of issues. Leave checking the physical cabling and SFPs until all others are excluded. So, troubleshooting order should be 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 3/4, 6/7
 May it be useful to someone, someday.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been applying to a ton of jobs for about 3 weeks now and I&#x27;ve had zero responses to anything. No rejections either, just dead silence. I&#x27;ve been a systems admin for 7 years and I&#x27;m really looking to move away ASAP, but it&#x27;s been impossible so far. Are there just a ton of experienced sysadmins in major cities with not enough jobs for everyone? In the past when I&#x27;ve applied locally, I&#x27;ve been offered an interview almost every time I&#x27;ve applied somewhere. Is 7 years just not enough experience anymore?

                              <span>Evening all,
 We go through quite a lot of headsets and bought a load of Manhattan USB headsets from our regular supplier.
 We also use sophos endpoint and use it’s usb device protection features, most devices are blocked unless we allow them.
 Storage devices are certainly heavily restricted, so strangely, we found new, out of the packet headsets, that are being blocked because they have storage in them.
 Tested on a machine that is isolated from the network and doesn’t have sophos on it, and found that it does indeed show a storage device, but doesn’t show up any drive.
 My first thought is that it’s a small batch of devices that may have been tampered with and is collecting audio. Which if it’s the case, is very bad.
 But if it’s not, what is it for, considering other “identical” model devices from the same order don’t have it at all.
 What can I do to try and figure it out, or should I just bring it up with the supplier/Manhattan?
 Thanks

                              <span>We are using M365 for email hosting with our MX records pointing to Mimecast as our primary email security solution. In recent months we have noticed more phishing emails being allowed through Mimecast and delivered to our users. We have very little in the way of EOP policies in place, our original thinking being that Mimecast is our email security layer in the first instance, not EOP. We&#x27;re now thinking about enabling the policies in EOP to act as a second line of defence. We&#x27;ve even noticed genuine phishing emails that have come through Mimecast to then be flagged as phishing by EOP, but delivered to user mailboxes due to our EOP Anti-spam -&gt; Connection filter policy that has all the Mimecast IPs within it, which then bypasses the majority of checks. Not good!
 Is anyone here running in this manner with Mimecast and EOP or indeed another security product sat in front of EOP? I&#x27;d be interested to hear how your EOP policies are configured, with regards to:
  
Anti-phishing
 Anti-spam
 Enhanced filtering
 Safe Links (Minecast vs EOP - We&#x27;re using Mimecast, which as I understand is a retrospective check of URLs when a user clicks)
  
Are your users OK with having multiple places to check for quarantined/junk emails? e.g. 1st line product (Mimecast in our case), Microsoft and Junk folder in Outlook.
 Are we attacking this in the wrong way and should be focusing on tightening up Mimecast rather than looking at EOP?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Semi rant semi question.
 Anyone else getting fed up with being asked to handle shit outside your scope while also being bugged and blamed for things not going as fast as everyone wants.
 Post COVID I have noticed a ridiculous increase in wait times for everything. Examples
  
Moved our shop to a wireless long range AP solution to share internet with main office (building is close) to cut down on our overall internet costs. AP equipment from CISCO took literally 6 months to get. Pushed back demolition of building near the shop as our Fuel Management Pump System is there and would be cut off from internet before AP installed if we demo&#x27;d 
 AC in shop storage room went out. Was asked for some reason to handle it so contacted and scheduled the recommended person boss wanted to use and it&#x27;s taken them a week to finally come out but shop manager sends me repeated emails on when this is going to get done.
 Anytime I order equipment needed outside the basics it takes a week or even two to arrive. Bosses complain every time saying it should be 2 days tops like everything is Amazon.
 All Vendors I deal with lately whether its security system maintenance or door fixes/AC are behind in work and take days to show up sometimes. Again... bosses whine about it and get aggravated. 
  
Question is, anyone else notice this trend getting worse? Especially an escalation in impatience lately?

                              <span>Hi all,
 We&#x27;re looking to create a GPO, or whatever is applicable, to automatically switch client machines to our public WiFi in the event the private network is down. Is there a way to store the public WiFi credentials and ensure that the machine only uses this as a failover -- i.e. it will always prioritize the private network when available? Thanks for any insight.

 just a quick question as I&#x27;m really unsure and maybe somebody could help me out on this one :D
 How would I have to license RDS when using multiple RDS servers where those servers are NOT redundant but rather server A serves use-case A and reaches VLAN A whereas server B is used for a totally different use-case (and another pool of users)?
 Can they both share a single RDS user CAL-pool? Would I have to have multiple RDS CAL pools (and license servers)?
 Or am I totally wrong on everything? :D
 Thanks. Much appreciated :)

 I am searching for some USB thumb drives, that can survive on a bunch of keys and that can survive daily use for multiple years.
 ​
 Are you using anything, that can fit my criteria?

 Thank you for your hints!

                              <span>TL/DR: would you hire someone with this on their resume:
 “studying for CCNP - using Cisco training and pass4sure”
 I had a candidate interviewing not long so ago and after reading their resume noticed they listed dump sites as one of their study materials. 
 This person had a ton of certs and had that they were current slated to take another one and had next to it listed that they are studying with pass4sure. 
 Basically “studying for CCNP - using Cisco training and pass4sure”
 I was super interested in interviewing this person mainly to ask wtf but unfortunately HR killed it after everyone brought it up. 
 A few colleagues basically said well if they still know their stuff what does it matter and basically work smarter not harder but obviously in a half joking sort of way. My opinion has always been cheating degrades everyone and worse yet forced those making exams to write worse and worse questions. 
 So would you hire someone that listed this?

 Is this due to the recent microsoft breach?

                              <span>Looking for some info on Canon printer/copier/scanner drivers, specifically with respect to deciding whether to use PCL6 or UFR II drivers in a Windows environment. We&#x27;ve always used PCL6 (for decades) but noticed a printing issue within Acrobat when using PCL6 that isn&#x27;t present with UFR II. IIRC, our Canon reseller mentioned something about UFR II not being compatible at the time we rolled out our six Canon devices, but I do not have any notes as to WHY that was the case. Any insight or experiences with either of these drivers would be much appreciated.

                              <span>Has anyone worked with a third party to help develop a formalized Disaster Recovery / Business Continuity Plan? My thought would be to contract a third party that has experience writing formal technical documents and I would work with them to develop a plan. Essentially, there would be several meetings where they interviewed me about infrastructures and systems and they would develop the document. Has anyone gone through this process before with a vendor? If so what were the costs? $2,500 , $5,000, $30,000 and who would you recommend.

                              <span>An employee was let go, and we cannot get into his MacBook Pro 2016.
 He apparently had Admin access, because our documented local admin account isn&#x27;t being accepted.
 It is not bound to the domain, although that is how it was configured when we gave it to him, so we can&#x27;t login with AD credentials.
 I cannot tell if he used an AppleID to sign in.
 Is there any way to reset this thing so we can re-use it?
 As in the title, we don&#x27;t know his password, and there is no reset code to use.
 There are no other Mac&#x27;s available to download MacOS from the store and create install media.
 Is this an expensive boat anchor?

 First off if I need to throw this in one of the other various IT subreddits I will; I figured I’d start here and go elsewhere if need be. 
 I am currently a “Network Administrator”. I was hired into this role shortly after joining my current company after the previous guy left mere months after I joined. The title makes little sense though; we rarely make any networking related changes or overhauls. Most of our environment is plug and play, and I’m not really allowed to make proper changes. (IE our largest location is one giant flat /8 and they don’t want that changing anytime soon). I am angling for a Title change to “Systems Administrator” to better fit the role I’m performing. 
 With that being said, I’m also looking for a compensation increase. While I am compensated fairly…</span>

 The site does have a street address listed in its &quot;contact us&quot; section in California. We&#x27;re on the east coast. The site is hosted with Name.com and uses Cloudflare for DNS (just A records).
 I&#x27;ve used the wayback machine to capture a few pages just in case.
 What on earth do we do? They&#x27;re clearly using our trademarks and copyrighted images. I have no idea if they&#x27;re just stealing credit cards from &quot;customers&quot;, actually reselling our products, or what.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 ​
 the company I work for sells document management software and recently some of our clients started asking if we have a &quot;customer portal&quot; so they can provide their documents to their end customers. 
 Our DMS solution does not provide this functionality yet, so I am looking to either buy/integrage &amp; adapt a third party solution or build our own. (classic make or buy decision)
 ​
 Now I am currently in the phase to check/analyse what is available out in the wild that we could probably integrate so we don&#x27;t have to re-invent the wheel. 
 This is why I am asking for your suggestions/recommendations of software/platforms that I might wanna have a look at. 
 ​
 Our clients who use our document management system want to be able to provide a selection of documents via a &quot;portal&quot; to their customers. Their customers might be other businesses or private people. For example a bank that wants to provide the bank statements to their customers via such portal. Or a construction company that wants to provide technical drawings to their contractors. etc. 
 ​
 The basic use case is more or less the same, though the industry varies. 
 ​
 The platform would sit in between the consumer of the documents and our document management system. 
 Most likely the communication between the platform and the DMS should be via REST API&#x27;s.
 ​
 Do you know of any solution that might cover the basic or advanced requirements of such a &quot;portal&quot; ?
 ​
 I&#x27;m also considering building something with the M365 platform (PowerApps, Azure Functions, PowerAutomate, etc.)
 ​
 One of the solutions I&#x27;ll be looking at will be https://www.deepbox.swiss/en/overview/
 ​
 Any ideas/suggestions are welcome!

                              <span>Hi All,
 Doing routine checks of our sign in logs.
 We have this week a user who&#x27;s account is registering a sign in, non mfa (single authentication - previously satisfied) every 3 to 5 minutes.
 The service is;
 Microsoft Teams Web Client - Skype Presence Service 
 ​
 Doing an audit does not show Teams signing in.. Can anyone shed any light as to what this is? We don&#x27;t use Skype, use Teams of course.. is this just the agent having issues or?
 Only one user.

                              <span>I recently read this thing called &quot;Cyber Signals&quot; - a new publication from Microsoft. These numbers made my skin itch, they seem so cheap! 
 🧑‍💻 Attacker for hire: Prices start at $250 per job 🧑‍💻
 🪲 Ransomware SaaS kit: $40 per month 🪲
 💻 Compromised PC: $0.13-$0.89 💻
 🔑 Stolen Credentials: $150 for 400 million (!!!!) 🔑
 🕵️ Spearphishing for hire: $100-$1000 per successful account 🕵️ 
 So for less than the cost of your weekly shopping, you can buy a Ransomware SaaS kit (now so popular it has it&#x27;s own name: RaaS). 
 For the price of your council tax, you can buy 400 million stolen credentials. 
 For the price of your energy bill this month, you can hire an attacker. 
 For somewhere around the price of your mortgage or rental payment, you could pay for a successful takeover of a highly targeted, important account within an organisation. 
 I was absolutely floored to learn how low some of these numbers are; especially the Spearphishing one. Okay, you have to know what to do with it afterward.. But even so, it&#x27;s a crazy world we live in. 
 Remember; You have to defend perfectly every time, an attacker only has to get it right against you once. Protect yourself: do the basics, do them well: 
 🔒 Enable MFA
 💉 Ensure virus definitions are up to date
 ⬆️ Keep endpoints (PC, laptop AND mobile) fully patched
 🚫 Don&#x27;t give out unnecessary admin privileges
 💾 Back up your data 
 Actioning the above will give you protection from 98% of attacks, say Microsoft.

                              <span>Hi all
 I have two servers running keepalived to share a virtual IP
 and haproxy to forward mail traffic to two mail servers using roundrobin. 
 Where i am currently stuck is
 when my IP fails over using keepalive(which works as expected)
 My HAProxy service doesn&#x27;t restart, so even though the IP fails over the server doesn&#x27;t work because haproxy is offline so no mail gets passed through.
 How do i ensure the haproxy service gets restarted once teh server picks up the VIP
 Here is my keepalived config
 ​
 global_defs { router_id haproxy02 # The hostname of this host! } vrrp_script haproxy { script &quot;killall -0 haproxy&quot; interval 2 weight 2 } vrrp_instance 50 { virtual_router_id 50 advert_int 1 priority 100 state Master interface eth0 virtual_ipaddress { 192.168.30.145 dev eth0 # The virtual IP address that will be shared betwee MASTER and BACKUP. } track_script { haproxy } } 
 My Backup haproxy has the same config but state is backup and priority is 50 
 thanks for taking a look

                              <span>I’ve got a site currently using MPLS with two domain controllers to link each of their two branches. The majority of their network shares are on one site’s server and accessed from the other site. The reliability is awful. I’d love to hear some recommendations for the best cloud solution for multi-location file sharing. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Part of a multi domain forest, the CA and Offline CA are in the same domain as these DCs. CA is set to only issue certs to the domain.
 Offline CA has been offline throughout this as well it shouldn&#x27;t be needed. CRLs are all valid. PKIView comes back all ok.
 I can see the standard AD templates on the DCs
 I can see the custom templates on other devices if I add them, just not the DCs
 I&#x27;ve tried adding a single DC on to the permisions for the template restarting the CA and still nothing
 The templates have the following persmions
 Authenticated users - Read
 Domain Admin - Read Enroll
 Domain Controlers - Enroll, Auto Enroll
 Tried settings Enterprise Domain Conrollers to Enroll too but made no difference.
 Has there been some changes to AD that means there&#x27;s now an extra step for DCs to see templates?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just had the intense displeasure of setting up an HP M209 printer for one of my staff.
 So...
 Recommendations for a small, portable/luggable B&amp;W laserjet printer/scanner that will happily connect via USB on Windows 10, doesn&#x27;t require an internet connection, doesn&#x27;t require a login, and if the drivers are already installed, doesn&#x27;t need elevated permissions to do anything.

Our password rules state users have to change their passwords every 42 days and everytime they change their AD password, they have to log back into Outlook (which more often than not results in an Outlook error) Tried enabling Password Writeback but that didn&#x27;t solve the issue. Can anyone help? I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s something obvious I&#x27;m missing...
 The powers at be don&#x27;t want SSO, so that&#x27;s a no go

                              <span>Hi all,
 At the request of the boss, I&#x27;ve been implementing PIM this week in time for an MSP switcheroo next week. 
 I&#x27;m writing an email to explain how to request roles in response to &#x27;we tried logging in and don&#x27;t have access&#x27; from the new service desk but I&#x27;m having a bit of trouble with the test account I&#x27;ve put together to grab screenshots from - 
 ​
 1- Should I need to sign out/in for the role to become active? The PIM page says the page will refresh by itself, you don&#x27;t need to sign out/in. 
 I&#x27;ve been trying this for the past couple of hours, and I kept having to sign out/in because waiting 3-5 minutes was yielding no change - the 365 admin page and the ECP page were giving a &#x27;no access sucker&#x27; unless I signed out/in.
 Meanwhile, after assigning direct access, then unassigning direct access, then trying again using PIM, it now HAS worked without signing out and in again. Is this the usual experience others have had, or have I just been particularly unlucky with propagation delays
 ​
 2- The Exchange recipient administrator role in particular seems bad for this - I assign it and activate it on my test account, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to do bugger all. I activate it, I sign out, sign in, do a little dance, and still don&#x27;t have access to the ECP. 
 Meanwhile, I assign it to be permanently active, sign out, sign in, BAM it&#x27;s immediately there and works flawlessly. 
 ​
 I&#x27;ve signed out and in to these accounts so many times I&#x27;m ready to sign out of existence entirely,I just want someone to confirm whether or not this is the experience other people have had or if I&#x27;m just having a particularly bad friday night. 
 ​
 I&#x27;m gonna go make a cup of tea and cry into it while I wait to see if it&#x27;s just been me all along

                              <span>Hello everyone
 I&#x27;m the systems admin (and CIO) for a small EU company with a centralized IT system hosting data on a windows file server (in a datacenter accessible via VPN). We also have a Google Workspace plan with an account for each employee.
 Each employee has a windows laptop with a VPN client, once the VPN is on the mapped drives on windows explorer are available. Share permissions are managed in AD.
 Everything on the file server is backed up with a 30-day retention scheme on AWS.
 My CEO wishes to switch all data hosting from the file server to shared Google Drives. He feels the data will be more easily accessible this way, but I really have concerns about this - about security mostly, but also data sync on the PCs and disk space, backups, ... I am reluctant about entrusting sensible data to a 3rd party.
 Is there a consensus about doing something like this in the sysadmin world ? I need to establish a lit of pros / cons to help making the decision : either keep everything as is or follow through.
 If I were to go through with this, are there some good practices to follow ? (obviously enabling MFA will be mandatory)
 Thanks

                              <span>Nestled in a basement office where the carpet likely has not been changed since Elvis breathed his last and the wallpaper since the Cuban missile crisis I work my electronic tasks.
 With no other IT staff on the continent currently I have to manage offices for a international organization to the best of my ability in my remote office.
 Not helped by often confusing and baffling requests from the head office, so elusive the number of times I have been there could be counted on one hand and I would still have a few fingers to lose.
 ​
 One request that came through a while back still eludes me to the reason why and no answers are forthcoming despite my requests.
 Just before a long weekend I am to lockdown the emails of 5 staff members of head office. No reason given. Just told to do so and if they send in tickets or call me, to let them know we are working on it.
 Its not until after the long weekend and several requests by the locked users for help that I am told to unlock them.
 ​
 No reason is given why, only that the masters of the company half a world away want it.
 None of them were fired as far as i know which makes sense (perhaps someone screwed up or was being terminated and we needed to limit access, that is nothing new to me).
 But nothing as far as I know changed and as all the other IT staff are out of contact right now, I would be the one to remove their access.
 ​
 It just leaves me with a uncertainty in my stomach.
 ​
 I am curious if any others have this happen to you. Told to change permissions like this with seemingly no rhyme or reason ?

 It&#x27;s only one domain account (others are fine), user is long time employee and knows what he is doing.
 User says that they are just doing their work, reading email, saving PDFs and suddenly they can&#x27;t access any shared drive (because their account was locked).
 Checked Security Logs, there are no events ID: 4740 (Is it possible that login it was disabled?)
 Downloaded Lockout status but Orig Lock only shows the domain computer that locked this account.
 Is it possible to find out what computer/IP request was originated from with wrong account info?

                              <span>I occasionally work at a site that has an interesting setup. It is a medium size Campus LAN type network, with 15 or so buildings each with a switch and each switch is connected to the next in a giant ring, with one link disabled by STP.
 I know the obvious answer is a ring topology, but this is a little unusual right? This is in an industrial type environment on an air-gapped system.
 Are there any benefits to running a network like this?

                              <span>Recently joined a company who signed with Masergy for their SDWAN OTT offering. 
 I am the sole network engineer and am making changes left and right to get things up to speed from the prior self-proclaimed engineer.
 We have not been impressed with their support or their implementation of SDWAN. It is legitimately just FortiGates following Fortinets MSP cookbook examples with a few changes. An insane amount of money for something I can do on my own faster, better and more reliably. 
 They use FortiManager and RestAPI Admins to pull analytics into their dashboard. We could get our own appliance for FMG and FAZ to accomplish this. 
 Why does this feel like a product designed for organizations without a dedicated network engineer? Am I missing the value here? Please, help me understand.

                              <span>Admittedly - BGP is my weakest point in networking. I know the full stack (wireless/switch/route/firewall); just not a ton of BGP experience. 
 I just tried attaching a visio, but /r networking wont allow images?
 I&#x27;m planning out architecture for SD wan mesh behind 2 BGP routers and after going through the documentation and videos; I really can&#x27;t figure out a way to define two different paths out of the network coming from a singular /24. Typically you&#x27;d create your sdwan interfaces and prefer one etc, but i only have one interface.
 Can&#x27;t do anything tricky with private IP space due to port-forwarding/ipsec and overall firewalling. Im thinking im going to need to re-configure the OUTSIDE interfaces with BGP and get rid of the route redistribution down to EIGRP. But even if I do; i still only have one interfaces
 Architecture
 2 Edge routers bgp peered between each other, distro&#x27;d EIGRP down to the firewalls (going to migrate to ospf cuz fortigate). 
 Hoping to get SD Wan set up to pipe critical org traffic out primary ISP and youtube/fb out the secondary ISP.

 getting a bit confused, there are multiple labs (3) totaling $400, does this include the exam or do I have to pay for the exam/cert separately people are saying the total cost of the exam is $400 so I&#x27;m getting a bit confused.

                              <span>I&#x27;d love to hear comments from people using EEE in real life. I recently tested a 48 port switch with all ports connected but with no traffic and saw a decrease in actual power consumption in the switch of ~15%. It was measured with an external current clamp meter, so pretty exact readings and not what the switch measured. 15% is not massive and when traffic actually starts to flow, that will decrease of course. What kind of accumulated savings do you see in your network?
 Have you seen problems with it? Why is it not the default settings if it has no adverse effects?

                              <span>I can dig through each switch and find out which mac address is on a port and vlan, then dig through the Gateway and associate an IP address with that Mac. Is there software that will map out every Cisco switchport mac addresses and IP addresses so I dont have to manually do it across ~500 switches every time someone needs to know which port something is on, or what its ip address is?

 I have made this question roughly a couple of years ago and people have commented that it is still worth pursuing it.
 I want to ask it again today: Do you think that someone should spend their time learning CCIE? I think learning cloud/automation/DevOps is far more relevant nowadays than the CCIE.
 This is excluding Cisco shops of course, where they need certified engineers to hold their status.

                              <span>Looking to replace a switch in our IDF cabinet (1 for now, a dozen more to come) and open to moving to a new brand. I have been loyal to Cisco for years but I don&#x27;t want to deal with subscription plans or complicated licenses on their new models. 
 We only need 24 ports (needs to be POE for access points) and will connect back to our core switches via 10GB fiber. 48 would still be fine if cost weren&#x27;t 2X a 24 port model. It would be going into an IDF cabinet that is in our warehouse, which is full of dust, so it needs to be something that can tolerate the environment.
 I know Arista has been up &amp; coming but I don&#x27;t know which model(s) would be a good fit.
 What else would you be considering?

                              <span>As the title suggests i&#x27;ve been given a Huawei MA5608T OLT, i need to configure it so we can start offering ftth services, we currently only have point-point connections, no splitters. I was wondering if anyone has any resources so i can learn a bit. I tried setting it up, but i only repeated the commands from the guide. I was hoping i can get a grasp of the different Terms used(line-profile, GEM ports?, T-CONTs?) , some best practices?

                              <span>I see that the when checking out for the EVE-NG Pro Licensing is for 1-year. Is this just support for 1-year or does the actual license expire after 1-year? I&#x27;ve been trying to figure this out but can not find information anywhere.
 ​
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>cellular providers often have monthly data limits, but additional data available for specific apps (like instagram, whatsapp, viber,...) 
 i think that it has something to do with the dns server, because if i turn on private dns, the data im using on an app is billed as regular internet usage and not that specific app usage

                              <span>Hi all,
 currently my company has a set of Cisco ASA&#x27;s in a datacenter for Point to site VPN connectivity. Clients get a static IP address and our routers/firewalls etc are configured to (dis)allow those clients to the backends. So basically, every client can get an ACL list attached to it. 
 But now we are going full into Azure. Since the Azure VPN gateways only give out dynamic IP addresses our current setup can&#x27;t be transferred to native Azure VPN&#x27;s. 
 I&#x27;ve seen that Cisco has the CSR 1000V in Azure, but I can&#x27;t find anything regarding static IP addresses (or pools) in the documentation. So, I&#x27;m not sure if this would fix our &quot;issue&quot;.
 Does anyone have an idea on this issue? I&#x27;d rather not deploy a VPN gateway for each set of users. ;) I&#x27;m also not tied to Cisco btw.

 I&#x27;d like to deny access to other devices in the same subnet for a particular PC with a managed switch but allow access to two printers and internet, is this possible with a managed switch?

                              <span>I have a server that started being inaccessible internally only every evening around the same time and access is restored after ~1hr. You cannot access the website OR RDP to it as it has a trust relationship error. It runs a Jira instance on it. The web interface is still accessible externally during this time as well as still being accessible as local host within the browser in the server. There is no backup running during the time its inaccessible and event logs do not show anything abnormal. Anyone have ideas?

                              <span>Hi there,
 We had to pull drives from a dell R620 server. There were 6 drives in total that had to be removed from the server. It is believed that 2 are in a RAID 1 for the OS and the remaining 4 in a RAID 5 but it is not confirmed. I won&#x27;t get into why we couldn&#x27;t confirm that, it&#x27;s a long story, but just go with it. 
 The drives were pulled BUT I realize that we did not note down the exact slot each drive came from. We will need to pop them back in further down the road. My initial thought process was the RIAD controller should be smart enough to figure it out, but I am realizing that might not be the case and I may have made a grave mistake.
 Just wondering if there&#x27;s any insight on whether or not the physical slot matters when it comes time to plug them back in. 
 Thank you very much

 Question is, with all of you being in the field for a lot longer than I, what is your personal favorite printers / brands and why?

                              <span>Anyone else going grey from the RDP issues effecting servers from the recent patches. 
 The reg key fix does not fix the problem for any of my team. 
 I only observe reset packets to a domain controller during the rdp request. Removing the October and September CU’s from that DC, resolve the issue seemingly. 
 My problem is that it appears totally random, I will have clients all at the same patch level, remote to the same server using the same dc. It will fail for one client and have no issue with the other. I will reboot the clients and it will start working again. 
 To add more salt to the wounds the OOB fix MS released does piss all for any win10/11 clients &amp; I’m not sure if they even acknowledged the issue right now

Running nslookup produces correct results. Can RDP between VMs from Azure and to any on prem servers. Started Monday. Has anyone seen this happen before?
 UPDATE: Removing KB5018474 from the on prem DC resolved the issue.

                              <span>Hello,
 Today our company hosted a Town Hall in Teams, and we had some serious issues that our CEO was pissed about.
 Background: Users were mostly on wired internal network, and using the Desktop Teams app.
 Had over 100 people in the call and we were recording it.
 1). Anyone with a webcam on was extremely laggy and glitchy, but audio was fine.
 2). Screen Sharing a video would not show for users in the call, they could only see a grey square.
 Had no issues when I joined on my phone and even the recording was fine. It&#x27;s when we were live that we had issues.
 Any solutions to this, I saw disabling GPU hardware acceleration helped, but I can&#x27;t find a way to disable it for all users.

 I was informed 3 days ago that in 2 weeks I&#x27;ll be undergoing a &quot;job audit&quot; which seems to be some dude asking me questions about what I do and how it compares to my job description. I figured &quot;eh whatever&quot; at first, but the thought hasn&#x27;t escaped my mind. Have any of you undergone an audit like this before?

                              <span>We&#x27;re getting straight up hammered with attacks right now - very targeted phishing, something is brute force hitting accounts, etc. Obviously these things go on all the time, but there&#x27;s been a dramatic uptick in the last 24 hours. The weird thing is, when accounts are compromised, we&#x27;re not able to see the logins in Azure at all, so we don&#x27;t even know where it&#x27;s coming from. Anyone else experiencing similar?
 Edit: Thanks everyone! We&#x27;re working on enabling and enforcing MFA, but we&#x27;ve got a few more weeks for a crunch to end before we&#x27;re allowed to implement.

                              <span>Having just endured 30 excruciating minutes of utter braindead idiocy that is trying to setup and configure WPA2-Enterprise on a Windows 10 machine, I wanna go and frickin&#x27; kill myself.
 ​
 How can it be so bad after so many years this protocol has been out?! Not only can the authentication options be changed only in the who knows how many years old control panel settings and not the modern settings app, but once you finish setting up the network, you can no longer modify some of the key attributes like which CA certificates to validate the radius server against!
 ​
 What. The. Hell. Microsoft.
 ​
 I swear, I don&#x27;t usually get my jimmies rustled at work, but this... This just bloody infuriated me!
 ​
 And that&#x27;s not the end of it, either!
 Once you finally figure out how to configure the authentication details... Unless you remembered to change one tiny little option in the PEAP configuration, if someone was to impersonate an AP, even if they present a completely different and invalid server certificate, windows just displays a puny little dialog going something like &quot;Do you expect this network to be present here?&quot; along with a hyperlink option to display the radius certificate, and a pair of buttons - Connect / Cancel.
 ​
 No huge warning like in web browsers, if a page presents an invalid SSL cert, noooo. No 3-dialogs-deep exception confirmation option or secret keyboard phrases. 
 ​
 A simple. Yes. No. 
 ​
 Am I missing something here, or would that take away all the benefits the Enterprise version of WPA2 has?

 i was curious how you guys keep your skills sharp, learn new stuff or maybe you have a specific platform were you learn certain stuff.
 I have been on ITProTV before and i&#x27;ve seen some interesting stuff there but atm gonna try coursera to find leaning materials to improve my IT Knowledge. 
 What do you use as your learning platform and why?

                              <span>Hi guys, as title suggests we have a couple of Acer laptops here and they all seem to go to sleep once shortly after booting up. After this happens it’s usually fine for the rest of the day.
 See below for error from error log:
 The system is entering sleep.
 Sleep reason application API
 Source: kernel-power
 Event ID 42
 Any advice would be appreciated. Even downloaded software “don’t sleep” and disabled sleep but it still does it.
 Edit
 It used to happen a lot more frequently, we thought it could be the cheap adapters we had. Replacing them helped a lot, but still sleeps occasionally but always seems to be very shortly after booting.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been asked to implement a PAM solution (Privileged Access Management). In a Microsoft Windows ecosystem (with mostly on-prem Active Directory but a little Azure AD mixed in), what does this look like? Does Microsoft have some basic PAM options built into their OS/Directory services? is there a separate Microsoft solution you can use (or purchase) that creates a basic PAM solution? if not, what third-party options exist? we use the following vendors for additional infrastructure services so something from them would be nice: Azure, Microsoft 365, Quest, SolarWinds, CrowdStrike, Mimecast, Duo, Palo Alto. I&#x27;m also curious what is the minimum configuration that meets the requirement of a PAM solution (can we make a low-level version of one out-of-the-box without having to purchase/install additional solutions)?

                              <span>How do you manage Backup Targets &amp; Selections in your IT shops? For example, let&#x27;s say you have 100 Windows Servers and 10 Windows 10 clients and you have been tasked with installing a brand new backup solution that backs up files and folders via backup agents. You are creating the new backup job, and you have to decide which servers/clients get agents installed, and which server/client disks/folders you want to select as part of your backup jobs. Does IT just make an educated guess at what needs to be backed up? Does the business unit provide IT with a list of data sources (structured and unstructured) and IT works off of that? 
 In our shop, IT decides what should be selected for backup on a daily basis knowing where actual company data lives. If it can&#x27;t be recreated elsewhere, we back it up. If there is another source of that same data (and its current, then we skip it). For example, we do backup our home and shared folders, but we don&#x27;t back up application installation folders.

                              <span>Hey All, 
 I have just started a new gig working in a 99% Terminal Services Environment with the vast majority of users working off Windows 7/10 HP Thin Clients connecting via RDS to Windows Server 2016. 
 Users are logging into Thin Clients with Generic Auto Logins and then authenticate via RDC to their sessions. This is problematic for new users because you can&#x27;t change your password from RDC, at least not without making the process overly complicated by disabling NLA Server Side and a convoluted process client side with first tie logins using a secondary RDC shortcut with CredSSP disabled.
 I haven&#x27;t worked in a shop that has had this problem, formally I was the IT manager for a mid size org and our TS were connected to from Windows workstations so users were already authenticated.
 The IT Manager&#x27;s process has been to assign users passwords in the past and set them to not expire. Then he would communicate the password to the user or manager for login. Obviously this is 1. Not Secure, 2. Cumbersome as hell. 3. Several points of failure. 
 This has been made more ridiculous by the fact that about 6 months ago they brought an MSP onboard who is now handling &quot;some&quot; of the user onboarding process including creation of AD accounts and they use a temp password as they should. But, now new users can&#x27;t login. And my understanding is that new users have just been hijacking others accounts to get to sessions, creating security issues, profiles issues etc. 
 My understanding is that the RDP Web Portal will resolve this issue, but I am honestly not familiar with using it and wanted to see if anyone had any input before I go suggesting this as the solution to the org. 
 My understanding is that Users would connect to the RDP Web Portal via a browser where they would authenticate for the first time and be able to reset their passwords, and from there they would have access to their Terminal Services Sessions, is this accurate?

                              <span>So it’s that time of the year where we start talking about calibration and who out of the team is the cream and rise to the top. Sadly out of my team of 5, only one is up for discussion for a promotion. The four other guys are just workers and I try to coach them so they can hit that next level but I don’t think they care or just think they are going to be promoted based on their employment length. These four guys work the best bankers hours in the business but if I need something pressing over outside of their time which happens maybe 5 times a year, 3 will never pick up the phone and will respond to my text hours later and the other one simply doesn’t acknowledge it all. The one guy who is getting promoted is super reliable and will not only answer my call but is happy to jump in if needed. Do people really think the are going to get a raise and promotion just because they show up and do their job? What ever happened to going above and beyond? These guys are going to be in for a shock especially with inflation and realize with their small bump, it’s actually going to be a pay cut in the long run.

 We also want to use Azure SMS service for emergency alerts and HR communication as many users are mobile only and not tech savvy. Azure SMS service needs the format as +country code 1235551212.
 One idea I have is to reformat the phones on extract from AAD into the country code format. I admit to not knowing everything, so I am asking for advice on this. Am I on the right path or are there better ideas?

                              <span>For the most part, Win 11 is pretty much the same, but there&#x27;s a few things I wanted to find out before continuing, particularly because the vast majority of our staff do not work from the office anymore.
  
While we&#x27;re still on Windows 10, I wanted to explore any/all new Group Policies for Windows 11. How do I correctly add the Win11&#x27;s C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions files to our SYSVOL without breaking Win10? Or are new PolicyDefinitions backwards compatible (ie all old settings are in new templates, so will still apply)? I&#x27;ve updated the policy templates in the past but only within the same OS - is it just the same procedure?
 
I think I read somewhere that Win11 is no longer supported by MDT as they&#x27;re pushing for InTune. I haven&#x27;t messed around with this yet, but is this true? We don&#x27;t use 365 (Google Workspace unfortunately) so having to subscribe/set up InTune would be an extra cost/delay to this whole thing.
 
If you&#x27;ve upgraded your domain to Win 11, how did you do this? Did you use WSUS to deploy the upgrade or did you recall the hardware to do it in person? I know the cleanest way is formatting but let&#x27;s assume that that&#x27;s just not an option for us.
 
Did your staff adjust/like the change to the center start menu/icons or do you/did you just take it back to the bottom left?

 That’s good great skills and of course applying other places, but man I really hate American business practices. They just pile work on you and try and squeeze as much out of you As They possibly can. It’s all about is getting as much bang for your buck as you can capitalism baby!
 The work just isn’t possible there’s over 150 employees at my location and I’m responsible for helpdesk engineering projects, cyber security, giant software upgrades, and everything in between. Last week they denied my request for back up software so this company isn’t looking good anyway Financially. It’s best I hit the door.
 Edit: hey woke up to an interview request! Fuck this place! Did I mention they stole 40 hour’s vacation due to an unwritten policy.

                              <span>Hi all,
 My company has a nice DR plan in place, but currently, said plan is only available in printed format at the homes and offices of all relevant persons.
 We’ve been thinking abou pushing out a pdf version to intune enrolled ios devices owned by the relevant persons, but are unsure if we can.
 How have you guys handled the distribution of DR plans?

                              <span>Hi All,
 I&#x27;m a Senior IT Tech at a rural ISP who&#x27;s just come in to replace a 3rd party support.
 One of the (many) issues I have is we have a handful of Linux users of which I&#x27;ve never managed from a sys admin view before (used Linux in personal life etc.).
 The issues i have are; 
 ​
  
They all want to use different distros
 don&#x27;t want to be managed via saas solutions
 want local admin on their devices
 they were given windows devices but 3rd party support to which they wiped and installed their flavour of Linux.
 CTO wants them to run Windows with linux in a Virtual box VM ( i dont think this is workable)
  
​
 My current thinking is, for them to all run the same flavour of Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 or 20.04 LTS) as these are both supported by Intune (in its infancy atm but hoping to get more control over the coming months) with AdminByRequest which i&#x27;m currently trailing with some windows users.
 I know no matter what i do i&#x27;m going to have an uphill battle as currently they have free roam of their devices as they&#x27;re basically personal devices at this stage! But from a sys admin and security viewpoint this is a huge no go! I want them to have the best experience to do their job as they can but there has to be a line where they are formatting devices! I know if i dont approach this right they will just format it again. Currently in the progress of writing a laptop policy for staff to sign also to stop them doing certain things without a slap on the wrists!
 Open to any other ideas or advice!

 ​
 I am stragling with setup WHfB on some computers in company. The hybrid key trust configuration is completed and basically it works flawless on all laptops. Though, on some desktops users cannot setup PIN due to error saying that this device do not meet WHfB requirements.
 Fun part is that if any other use sign-in to that desktops with his account, then the issue not exist anymore and they can set their PINs. So, despite of what the error says, I think it is some issue with specific users profile. I believe they tried setup Windows hello before the configuration was ready so something might be mixing here now. I tried to delete NGC folder, but that did not help.
 Is there any way to completely purge WHfB settings of user, other than complete deletion of his profile?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m currently troubleshooting an issue with our 2 on premise Domain Controllers,
 +6000 event 521 are generated every hour (Status code 0x80000005)
 From what I can gather, the issue could be that &quot;LSA Queue&quot; is full, because Audit events are generated faster than what can be processed. ( windows - Event ID 521 - Critical Logging Failure on Domain Controllers - Server Fault )
 Now, enabling the LSA event log, shows a lot of Event ID300&#x27;s containing &quot;Groups assigned to a new logon.&quot; and then the device/user and the groups assigned. Which to me seems of no value logging wise.
 ​
 Has anyone here dealt with that type of problem?
 Right now I&#x27;m looking into either increasing the LSA Queue, og maybe limit/remove that particular audit event.

 We have GLPI here and 4 domains.
 I need to pre select the domain for the login page (actually users need to select their domain) 
 Do you know any way to do this?
 Maybe via the url but I can&#x27;t find something which is working...
 Thanks! :)

                              <span>Hey all,
 ​
 Just wondering if anyone&#x27;s supporting Huawei devices that have suddenly started prompting users for having the wrong username/password in the past couple days.
 Have had a few staff in China with BYOD phones (P40&#x27;s) not able to get their work emails anymore using the default built in mail app. I don&#x27;t have such a device myself to test with unfortunately - only an old pre-trade war Nova 3i.
 Re-entering passwords hasn&#x27;t helped, re-creating the account hasn&#x27;t worked.
 Edit - Azure sign in logs show no failures, Disabling MFA doesn&#x27;t help, google has no suggestions, Huawei website lacks info and the Huawei subreddit has no posts complaining about this either, so wondering if it&#x27;s a Microsoft change or what?
 Outlook app proper seems to work, but it seems the default one has better contacts integration, like how Apple&#x27;s mail app is the only one that works for their contacts.
 ​
 Anyone else? Ta :)

 I need help using sysprep to create , capture and deploy the image with some applications to a flash drive. I can’t use MDT third party tools due to work limitations 
 I cant use a server, I just have a laptop with clean windows 11 installed and it has the applications that I need to add to the image.
 I did lots of research it seems like there are many methods with different applications . I want to use sysprep and maybe dism something that is built-in windows 11 only

                              <span>Hi guys,
 we&#x27;re trying to rollout some yubikeys to our colleagues and my boss wants to &quot;force&quot; usage as smart cards for windows 10 (ie: GPO Interactive Logon: force smart card or windows hello). This leaves us with a bunch of problems:
  
we have to use admin yubikeys to elevate local demands
 remote support has to have a passthrough functionality (currently talking with teamviewer here)
  
So my question is, do you guys know any middleware that allows a bit finer tuning of windows logon instead of goin all in with that GPO? I heard about SCInterface or DUO. Any experience with this kind of software? Is it even possible?
 Regards.

 However, can&#x27;t find the right criteria.
 Already tried the following:
 samba-tool user edit myuser --mail [noemail@noemail.com](mailto:noemail@noemail.com)
 samba-tool user edit myuser [&quot;mail:noemail@noemail.com](mailto:%22mail:noemail@noemail.com)&quot;
 Has anyone tried to do this before?

                              <span>A fellow SysAdmin was making 80K salaried, but working 60 hour weeks, easily. Typically 5-7am to 5-7pm. Not to mention after hours when on call. That is actually less per hour than average Tier 1 Help Desk technicians make here (~$22/hr), if they work 60 hour weeks with overtime past the 40 hour mark (1.5x). Not to mention, $22 is starting rate.
 40*22*52+20*33*52 &#x3D; 80,080 &gt; 80,000
 Basically if a Help Desk worker put in 60 hour weeks, they would be above SysAdmin for annual income, even if both were doing the same (60 hours). And Help Desk would be not needing to be on call at all. The only thing stopping this, is Help Desk managers restricting total weekly hours techs can work (in theory). I know this is part of why companies have salaried workers in the first place, but it&#x27;s still wild to think many SysAdmins are making such a low effective rate per hour.

 I have some iPads in our WorkspaceONE that cause issues. The user using his Credentials to Setup the device (Didn&#x27;t clicked on: Leave Remote Management). Now their are logged in with the User Account but the device stuck in the Pre-enrollment Registration Record. And there is no linked device on the users accounts.

 Any ideas?

 I have 20+ years experience with Cisco and would rather not stray but I am being forced to look at alternatives due to supply chain constraints and our timeline. 
 I am told they are not as affected by supply chain but am cautious that there may be a reason for that as if they aren’t as good.
 Curious about others thoughts.
 Thanks!

 Server: Dell PowerEdge R7525
 OS: ESXi 7.0.3
 Card: Intel E810-XXVDA4
 Switch: QNAP QSW-M5216-1T-US
 ​
 Hello,
 I recently got a new Switch (above model) and the Intel 25Gb card (not directly from Dell) and added it to our R7525 in one of the empty bays.
 The 25Gb connection worked for a few hours, but has yet to work again. It works at 10Gb fine to the above Switch using a non-25Gb (SFP+) cable, but as soon as an SFP28 cable is used to that Switch, it doesn&#x27;t show a connection on either end (NIC or Switch). However, using a regular SFP+ cable, both work fine. And the SFP28 cable works in a different NIC entirely connecting at 10Gb, so the cables are fine. And the NIC itself is fine, since it works at 10Gb perfectly fine (and once at 25Gb fine (I even took a screenshot to show a coworker we were finally at 25Gb internally)).
 However, I&#x27;m at a loss at what could cause it no longer working, especially when neither the NIC or the Switch is showing any sort of connection using SF28 a cable. And ESXi shows the connection as &quot;Down,&quot; of course.
 And the server is fairly brand new, so I know it has plenty of PCIe lanes to absorb and plenty of empty PCIe slots to use up since dual-CPU server. I think I tried slot 5 and 7 in the server. It initially worked that one time on slot 5 (I think it was in riser 2?), but stopped after a few hours.
 Multiple cables, multiple manufacturers (10GTek coded for Cisco (initial); Macroreer coded for Intel (last resort)).
 Dell will obviously not assistance since the card is aftermarket, but I have 2 and both are doing the same thing in this same server.
 Link for proof it DID work : https://imgur.com/a/33jBzsH
 Any sort of assistance/direction would be greatly appreciated, as I&#x27;m clueless at this point.

                              <span>Hi guys, first of all I&#x27;m not a high-level networking engineer, far from it actually, but I know my way around most of the stuff we need to do, and as a lone sysadmin I kind of have to.
 We recently migrated to Nutanix and along with the nodes we got ourselves a pair of new Alcatel OmniSwitch OS6900 TOR switches. Tricky ones to manage, but solid. 
 Our old server rack will be decommissioned but our old TOR switches are not that old at all, they&#x27;re a pair of HP FlexFabric 5700s. Our core switch, on the other hand, is a VERY old HP 5406zl, with rapidly dying PoE ports and a general feeling that the whole thing is going to die soon as well. Switches are still hard to find, so getting new ones would take at least 6 to 10 months. 
 So, in the meantime, I&#x27;m thinking about replacing the 5400 with the 5700.
 Now, when I say &quot;core&quot; switch I do not actually mean it, it&#x27;s by all intents and purposes an access switch: no l3, no gateway, no nothing. All routing is done through the firewall. All it has connected to it are clients, and a trunk to the TOR switches.
 We would not hit any of the limitations of the 5700 (i.e. the 1024 entry arp-table) but we would gain a healthy new switch.
 Yet, since I constantly doubt myself, I&#x27;m asking Reddit: am I missing something here?

                              <span>The wikipedia article about TCP says:
  
Some TCP implementation use selective acknowledgements (SACKs) to provide explicit feedback about the segments that have been received. This greatly improves TCP&#x27;s ability to retransmit the right segments.
  
but it doesn&#x27;t say how common that both sides support this is. Is it like 50% of all tcp connections? 90%? 10%?
 Thanks!

The cabling, not the business. :) I&#x27;ve been slowly working on eliminating a lot of bad choices (e.g. cheap unshielded cat5 draped over fluorescent fixtures), but recently a supervisor has insisted that despite us never getting dinged on fire inspections for this, that &quot;loose electrical wiring&quot; is a problem and I have to act quickly on eliminating data cables poking through the drop ceiling to staff desks. I&#x27;m trying to find actual fire code around this specifically to avoid making this all a pointless priority. Any experts that can simplify this for me?

                              <span>Years ago we implemented a solution working with a Cisco guy who has now gone on to other jobs. I have maintained the solution with a very basic level of Cisco knowledge he passed on. We are looking at replacing the devices before we face an outage and are scrambling. We are trying to find a more user-friendly solution that still does the job and thus I seek advice.
 Currently, we have two Cisco 1811 in a data center. Our needs are fairly simple and I have been told in the past we can replace both with a single device these days. We have an Incoming device that has VPNs to the providers and contains all the traffic from field devices. That is connected to the second outgoing CISCO directly and then routes traffic via VPN to various clients based on which devices are theirs.
 Traffic to the internet is restricted with a few exceptions, some IP based, some port-based.
 What replacement device would best meet my needs? Preferably something with a GUI interface instead of the CISCO command lines. 
 *edit to add some details*
 My concerns are really just about the two routers into one or needing two.
 At present, I have some IP routes for each client VPN, like below.
 ip route 10.232.0.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2
 ip route 10.232.24.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2
 ip route 10.232.32.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2
 I also have to NAT everything from one provider&#x27;s VPN to the client VPN.
 ip nat inside source static 10.232.128.200 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
 I don&#x27;t really care about the brand, just function and something a bit more user-friendly for a fairly entry-level of networking knowledge.

                              <span>I was starting a new branch office and deployed a single AP from my reserves until my order of 635s come in (lol.) I created the site, configured the first AP setup the Virtual Controller, SSID, etc. 
 I upgraded the AP to &quot;latest recommended version&quot; which was version 10.x versus the 8.9.0.3 the AP was on previously.
 All the options for configuring the VC in central went away. I asked my rep about it, and got this statement back:
 I&#x27;m afraid &quot;Virtual Mobility Gateways&quot; are not supported yet. Right now, the only thing we have is &quot;Virtual VPNCs&quot;, which you can run in Azure, AWS, Google and ESXi. 
 So before you blindly upgrade central connected IAPs in a VC setup, take heed.

Often times, it will just fail to update information displayed without a refresh or dumping browser data. It&#x27;s also not uncommon for it to just fail to load. Usually I can clear that up by clearing browser data, but now it&#x27;s just spinning when I try to log in. If I&#x27;m gonna throw all my eggs in this basket, I had better be able to get to it!

I even got someone to come out and walk through with me, was promised a quote in a week and its been 2 months of crickets. We are in a very rural small town so it is often a challenge getting this sort of help.
 The back story is my very small family law firm is renovating the building next door to move our offices there in order to get more space. I personally ran all of the ethernet cable in the new building and am patching it down little by little. I am fairly comfortable with basic internet networking, certainly comfortable enough to meet the very basic needs we have. What I don&#x27;t know much about is the p…</span>

                              <span>Recently I had a Cisco AP (3802i) swapped out for an Extreme Networks one (AP250) trying to test something. Got the Extreme AP connected and it connected back to XIQ fine. AP reported that there were several clients connected to it and I figured everything was fine. Turns out things were not fine as the clients (primarily iPads) now consistently disconnect from wireless. Some flat out drop off Wifi and say &quot;Cannot connect to X network&quot; or that they can&#x27;t connect to the Internet and other times they appear to be working but with low signal strength. I think they&#x27;re going from the Extreme AP to a Cisco one that&#x27;s in another room across the hall from where the Extreme AP which is really odd since that Cisco AP appears to have really weak signal going into that room. 
 ​
 The same SSIDs are configured on both Cisco and Extreme with the same VLANs being attributed to both. We use the same model of Extreme Network APs in another building and they work fine. My guess is that the clients keep trying to connect to the Cisco AP instead of the Extreme but I&#x27;m not understanding why when the Extreme AP should have better signal strength vs the Cisco one. I know mixing APs from different manufacturers isn&#x27;t really ideal but this was the only room where we made this kind of swap.

Why did you / didn&#x27;t you migrate? 
 How did the migration of the rules go for you and how many rules did you have? 
 Did you migrate the rules from Panorama  Fortimanager or from the firewall  fortigate? 
 Are you using Fortinet SD-WAN (please provide scale) and how is it working out for you? 
 Are the SSL Decrypt performance numbers as great as fortinet says?

 We are working on implement management access for our campus and data center switches. My question is around how to handle this on L3 network (access-distribution-core). We have access and distribution switches in multiple building terminating to main core on L3.
 Do you crate separate vlan switches for each building or keep consistent network subnet or vlan ? what is the best practice?

                              <span>Hi guys it think I went to a rabbit hole and I&#x27;m quite unsure what type of serial cable is required to connect my Laptop to a SBC.
 I thought that all serial cables are the same eventual I found out that there are ; - Crossover or &quot;Null Modem&quot; - Straight Through Serial Cable
 My question is all crossover cables are Null modem?
 From the oracle documents the connection is required to have this pin out.
 Pin 3 --&gt; Receive Data Pin 4 --&gt; Transit Data Pin 6 --&gt; GND 
 I have found on superuser web page that I could use RS232 Null Modem Cable DB9F to DB9M which I bought from Amazon.
 Is this cable allright? Did anyone used this type of connection before?
 Are there any SSH terminals that could change the serial PIN out?
 Any help would be appreciated.
 BTW my laptop doesn&#x27;t have a serial connection, so USB 2.0 is my only option.

                              <span>For work I have to use &#x27;Checkpoint VPN&#x27; and that breaks my &#x27;local&#x27; network. 
 In briefly, I have 2 routers (one on 192.168.1.1 and the other in 192.168.1.254 ) and a home server. When the VPN is off everything works fine, both in safari and in chrome. When I switch on the VPN, on chrome I can&#x27;t connect to 192.168.1.1 and to the home server (192.168.1.80), although I can connect to the home server from safari, but not to the first router (192.168.1.1) BUT on both safari and chrome I can connect to the other router (192.168.1.254).
 I honestly can&#x27;t get my head around why on two browsers on the same machine the behaviour is not the same. 
 How can I solve these problems?

 I am little confused about DAC and Fiber usage. It looks like DAC is cheaper. Is there any difference between them functionality wise? I have to connect FW to my Switch with 10G links and they are racked up close to each other. Which one I should use for better performance?

                              <span>A little more context:
 I work in a team of 5 (manager and 3 other network admins). There&#x27;s kinda no direction or vision, feel like there&#x27;s barely any management from our manager (apart from a &quot;you doing OK?&quot; every few days). We&#x27;ve just got a few projects we&#x27;re each working on, but other than that there&#x27;s really no visibility into what&#x27;s going on.
 Everyone works from home, so it&#x27;s hard to feel like I&#x27;m even working in a team to be honest.
 Does anyone else experience this? Is it normal?

                              <span>We are being tasked with selecting several products for comparison for SAN solutions. We are heavily leaning towards TruNAS based on past experiences but an industry peer suggested JetStor. Beyond his suggestion we’ve never heard of this nor ever seen one in production anywhere. There is extremely limited information about them and what I did gather is that the underlying device OS is Russian developed (not that there is anything inherently wrong with that, but, you know…). 
 Anyone seen or heard of this before?

                              <span>I was not aware of TeamViewer&#x27;s little renewal scam requiring a 28 day prior notice. Tried to cancel several days prior to the renewal date. Told them to check my account, that I rarely use it and won&#x27;t be needing it at all going forward. The response was basically pound sand, you should have read the fine print, we&#x27;re doing this to you because we can, too bad for you that you don&#x27;t need our service. Anybody know how to effectively fight these creeps if one values their credit rating? They go full-on scam, reminder &quot;fees&quot;, late fees, and threaten collections. I wonder how many of their business customers realize what kind of people they are dealing with? I thought they were reputable until this happened and I started googling their business practices.

                              <span>I am in the cloud section of my network security class and I&#x27;m not sure I fully understand MDM&#x27;s but I&#x27;m under the impression that they are tools to manage, restrict, update, and track mobile devices like laptops, cell phones, and tablets. I know there are tools like this for policy enforcement and patch rollouts for stationary machines in an organization, but what is the general term? 
 TL;DR - MDM is to mobile as ____ is to PC?

                              <span>Original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/xcqz2r/solo_it_asked_to_do_engineering_work
 So a while back I, solo IT at my company, was asked to restructure the manufacturing processes in our companies manufacturing planning system (see original post for full story). As many pointed out, this fell entirely in the realm of industrial engineering.
 A few days ago I made the company an offer. I would help restructure their processes with the help of 3rd party consultants, but I will not work IT at the same time. So they&#x27;d have to choose what full time position they want me to be in.
 After consideration they decided today that they wanted me to work full time on reimplementing their manufacturing processes and it would be very clear to the rest of the company that I am no longer IT and should not be approached regarding regarding any IT issue moving forward. This will take effect in 1-2 weeks.
 I then asked, so how will IT be handled when I&#x27;m moved off? How will we hire someone in time to learn and manage all the IT processes? They said that end-users will have to step up their game and figure out how to troubleshoot their own issues.
 I&#x27;m very excited. Not only do I get to tell end users &quot;not my problem anymore&quot; when the inevitable storm hits from IT being torn away, Im also betting they last no more than 2 weeks tops before they pull me off engineering and beg me to get back to handling IT. We&#x27;ll see how that conversation goes 😉

                              <span>I used to work retail for a long while and I would work sick because if you called off managers would be pissed and you would &quot;screw over&quot; your department, or wherever you worked.
 I remember other co workers at the time get shit talked about them while they were out sick. Like Managers would be like &quot;so nice of Jerry to leave us hanging like this&quot;. It made an enviroment where you NEVER wanted to take a sick day because you would be letting everyone down.
 ​
 Fast forward to now, I woke up the other day with fever and real bad sore throat. I sent an email to my boss saying I wasn&#x27;t going to be in and he was totally fine with it. I still felt guilty, and tried coming in today since I felt a lot better, but everyone at work was just like &quot;nah go home, we don&#x27;t want to catch whatever you had&quot;, even when I went to tell my boss I was going home, he was totally cool with me taking today off as well.

This was the result of an employee who does not want her manager having this ability. Her argument is that Hipaa related (and company related) mental health issues might be disclosed.

                              <span>They wanted payroll integrated into ERP. Both vendors assured us it wouldn&#x27;t be a problem. At implementation time neither vendor would take responsibility for the integration. What they meant from the start is that it&#x27;s possible to use ETL to connect the two. I had to build it. Now it&#x27;s my baby and any time there&#x27;s a problem with it, I have to fix it. I&#x27;ve got a baker&#x27;s dozen babies at this point. Got an email from a manager the other day asking me to show him how to troubleshoot the solution that his department needs so that he doesn&#x27;t have to wait for me to be free to fix it. I was seconds away from suggesting that he could prevent the problems proactively by hiring competent people who wouldn&#x27;t fuck it up in the first place. I don&#x27;t know where I&#x27;m going with this. It&#x27;s just a pointless rant. The real solution is that I need to train my tiny little team on all these solutions so that we can support them as a team. I&#x27;m just afraid that once I let them loose on my environment, they&#x27;ll just become another userbase that I constantly have to support.

                              <span>Hi,
 At my workplace we have a SCCM server which does have WSUS enabled on it, and we just got a couple of new Win 11 machines and there were a couple of issues we are experiencing with them being able to update from the Windows Updates section in Settings.
 After a machine joins the domain it will install the SCCM client and once the client is installed it removes the &quot;Check online for updates from Microsoft Update&quot; in Windows Updates. I know there are some registry entries you can change or delete to get it working but I was wondering has anyone been able to get that back wither it was from Group Policy or another method? Or if anyone else has dealt with the same issue they has a resolution to it? Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had to stop myself 3 times this week from dumping my gear in my bosses office with a note that says I quit. But I&#x27;m a chicken and I feel too guilty to quit.
 I have been working non stop since July while the executives pat each other on the backs and congratulate each other on all the growth they&#x27;ve had. Including myself I have a team of 3. They have went from 300 people last year to 800 this year. Two helpdesk and me the &quot;IT manager&quot;. Or should I say field tech/sysadmin/network engineer/helpdesk Tier 2/security.
 They have opened up 3 new branches and bought one company. They gave one week lead times for each to be set up. They have me traveling and staying overnight all over the state for these. They now want a network overhaul by thanksgiving for cyber insurance purposes and a new time keep software customized, tested, trained, and deployed before December. I&#x27;m working through nights days and weekends.
 Maybe I&#x27;m just not cut out for IT management. I&#x27;ve started having heart palpitations. I&#x27;m terrified every time my phone dings. I daydream every time I drive to work on crashing just to get a short break in the hospital. My temper and anxiety are 0 to 100 at the smallest problem. Maybe I should be a potato farmer.
 I was getting paid $50,000 a year at the beginning of the year. I&#x27;ve been in this position for 4 years. I demanded more money and they bumped me to $70,000 and promise to double my bonus making it 10 grand at the end of November.
 I&#x27;m trying to just get everything they want done and hang on to get my bonus. Then push my guilt down enough to dip. I miss my family.

 Have done the URL rewrite, and the response from a test done by an auditor is HTTP 1.1 400 bad request, which they (their system) says indicates no mitigation has been done. Is that not the response desired or expected when implementing the fix above?

                              <span>Hi, we want to login via fingerprint in our domain. I enabled GPOs:
 - Turn on convenience PIN sign-in
 - Enable Domain users Sign-in
 - Allow the use of biometrics
 - Allow users to log on using biometrics
 - Allow Windows Hello for Business is NOT configured
 I can see that the policy is applied, but I can&#x27;t set a PIN (required for fingerprint) or fingerprint (Option not available). Any ideas?

                              <span>Hi everyone. I was hoping someone would have a good recommendation for a remote desktop solution in which the client could be installed on a Mac that only has user rights. I really like Splashtop for my own environment, and it has pretty stellar GPU-accelerated features for streaming content too. I have been unsuccessful in figuring out how to install the Splashtop client on a company-owned Mac machine and would like to figure out another solution (open-source and without subscription is preferred but any recommendation is welcomed). Thanks!

                              <span>Yesterday I enabled 2FA for all users via a conditional access policy. Majority had 2FA enforced anyway, including our admin account used for AD Connect.
 We&#x27;re now receiving errors with our Azure AD Connect sync - specifically:
 &quot;Due to a configuration change made by your administrator, or because you moved to a new location, you must enroll in multi-factor authentication to access&quot;.
 When I check the sign-in logs for that account I can see that it&#x27;s suggested that the MFA claim isn&#x27;t being satisfied which is required because of the CA policy enforced.
 However, that&#x27;s not the case because we have 2FA enforced and when going through the Azure AD Connect sync process, I&#x27;m entering the 2FA code we have in our 2FA app, which is accepted.
 We&#x27;re also able to log into the admin portal with the same account while satisfying the 2FA requirements.
 I&#x27;ve disabled 2FA on the account and re-enabled it, but this has made no difference. We also don&#x27;t have security defaults enabled.
 The user is also not part of risky users or risky sign-ins.
 Has anyone come across this before?

 First I would say, sorry if I use the wrong words for data
 Also my code in this post is just top of head, not sure it&#x27;s the correct syntax
 What am I saying, by learning about data?
 I am talking about understanding method of storing data below
 CSV files
 Excel files
 SQL
 Data validation and structure (This is very important)
 When I understood the importance
 At my first job, we did sadly not get to script, or use powershell because we had something like SCCM but with no code at all
 I worked in the govt in a small municipality
 But what happened often was we would get assigned a task, like example, keep track of 300 PC&#x27;s, their users, and PC names in this excel document
 Well to say we had many things in excel documents, and we spend a ton of time just updating them and …</span>

                              <span>Apologies, but I am not able to comment on the megathread for some reason. So I am making a post. We have had issues after installing the October updates on our DC&#x27;s. The issue seemed to prevent cross-site kerberos authentication over RDP for us. We&#x27;d see an event ID 4769 with the error code of 0x14(TGT was revoked). It failed until we uninstalled almost every update from October. Below is the event, the account name section was always empty.
 Is there something I have missed with these updates that would cause this? I feel if the issue was present for everyone it&#x27;d be a lot bigger deal and I&#x27;d see more information. However, I have seen no mention of issues for anyone else.
 A Kerberos service ticket was requested.

 Site bindings are all 80 and 443 using the correct host names for the sites themselves
 Strange part - if I browse to the public IP of this server (it&#x27;s in Azure so I know it&#x27;s just this 1 server) I get a Windows security prompt asking for a username and password
 If I put in the creds of a legit account, it accepts them and then 404s
 If I give it wrong creds, it just asks for the username and password again
 I&#x27;ve checked every site and I don&#x27;t see anywhere on them that mentions any kind of auth like this (they&#x27;re not listening on the IP itself, so nothing should come up)
 Has anyone come across this before? Server has been rebooted and procmon isn&#x27;t showing anything useful for this

                              <span>Anyone knows of a good monitoring software that includes computer hardware performance. Reason is we recently bought this company and they have a few numbers of office staff. Their computer is somewhat ancient in terms of the efficiency and what programs they need t access. Our company don&#x27;t really have the extra budget to replace all their computers or to hire more ITs. I need something to help me monitor if their computers are failing and to give me a heads up. 
 I been doing my research but I want to know what you guys think. Thanks.

                              <span>r/Emailmarketing does not let me post so I want to ask this question here
 In our company we have two use cases for sending mails to a larger audience
  
Multiple times a year, we want to inform part of our customers (or all) of increasing prices for our products. Recipient count around 1000-1500.
 Marketing wants to inform customers of upcoming trade fairs
  
I have just now learned about different email marketing software and that there is a difference between a marketing mail and a transactional mail. I am under the assumption that for use case 1) we should not use our own mail server since the high amount of mails might put us on a blacklist - is this correct?
 If yes and we need an external tool for this, would use case 1) count as a transactional mail? All recipients come from our CRM system and had direct contact to Sales at some point in the past.
 For use case 2) I&#x27;m pretty sure this counts as a marketing mail and requires recipients to opt-in first. This is fine for use case 2) but would not make much sense for use case 1) as getting all of our customers to sign up for price increase mails is unrealistic.
 I would appreciate some further input to guide me in the right direction. Thanks!

 We bought a &quot;small&quot; 75 person company, they have on prem AD, and hybrid exchange and so do we.
 We&#x27;d like to merge all their users/computers/domains into our AD. Same thing for their mailboxes (they don&#x27;t use much else o365 related)
 So far we&#x27;ve set up the vpn between the 2 locations and we&#x27;re going to raise domain/forest level to match the highest one and set up the trust between the two domains.
 Which steps are needed to do this as smoothly as possible ?
 Thanks in advance

 Are there any jobs in IT that involve moving around and paying well?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve been noticing recently that some new HP computers run a bios firmware upgrade during their deployment (using MDT). During the deployment, I install a recent cumulative update which I downloaded from the microsoft catalog. This is a rudimentary way to have a windows deployment up to date when delivering it. After deployment, the sccm update system kicks in.
 The process of Bios firmware updates coming with Windows updates is detailed here:
 https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c07009542
 Strangely, I&#x27;ve never seen these bios firmware updates happen with updates pushed to clients over SCCM, even though the cumulative updates should be the same.
 Is anyone aware of a difference between cumulative updates pushed with SCCM and cumulative updates downloaded from the catalog, or of another process which might block bios firmware upgrades during the regular monthly update cycle?
 I don&#x27;t necessarily dislike the update process over wsus if it takes care of bios passwords and bitlocker lockouts (which it seems to do) but I&#x27;d rather schedule it and inform the users if it would come in the regular monthly update cycle.
 The settings titled “Prompt for Admin authentication on Capsule Update” controls the password requirement for use with BIOS updates via UEFI Capsule. The default value is “Disable,” which does not require a password for this flash mechanism.

                              <span>Probably a long shot, but would really appreciate any suggestions- 
 I work for a training center that teaches MS Office applications, Windows, and some more technical classes such as SQL and Windows Server. Since all of our classes went virtual a couple years ago, I created a way of running the classes- I set up a Guacamole server to get the students into their lab PCs. We use GoToTraining for the classroom meeting. And finally we use Logical Operations for the courseware book &amp; materials. 
 This has worked ok, but it&#x27;s a bit clunky giving the students 3 different things to log into. Especially for our more novice ones, it can be a hassle. Does anyone know of an off-the-shelf learning system that we could use to combine these things?

                              <span>We&#x27;re going to shortly refresh our fleet of remote laptops by resetting Windows, configuring them with Autopilot and enrolling them with Intune for management. We currently deploy devices with MDT and are able to specify that the drive is Bitlocker encrypted with the requirement to unlock being that the TPM is present and the user uses a PIN. It doesn&#x27;t appear that this is possible with Autopilot - there&#x27;s no built in mechanism during the Autopilot process to prompt a user to enter a pin that would then need to be used to unlock the drive when they power it on. Has anyone found a way to achieve this?
 This has raised the question whether the additional protection of a PIN (alongside the TPM) is necessary to secure our remote devices. If we BitLocker our drives using the TPM only as the requirement to unlock it then the data on it is protected if the drive is removed and plugged in to another machine. Additionally, if the device is lost/stolen then the user will need Windows credentials to log in to the laptop and access the data on it. If we couldn&#x27;t find a way to dynamically add a pin to our remote devices, are there any things I&#x27;m missing by using this as a secure solution? 
 We want our data to be secure on our remote devices and up until now BitLocker with a TPM and a Pin has been how we achieve that. I guess my question is whether our data on remote devices is still considered to be secure (in the eyes of the industry and best practice) if we encrypt our drives using TPM only as the mechanism to unlock it.

                              <span>From the 365 Admin portal, when an employee leaves if we go to the user&#x27;s account and &quot;create Onedrive link&quot; to better organize files so we can download to archive, the download will never be complete and we cannot figure it out. Anyone else had this before?
 We have tried different computers, internet connections, and browsers. For instance, we had a 4GB OneDrive...from 3 separate attempts to download from different connections mentioned: 1.1GB, 700MB, and 1.4GB. We just had a 142GB OneDrive that didn&#x27;t even come close to finishing. 
 Is there a restriction we are overlooking that is causing this? Thanks

 Failed downloads, failed installations, failed verification to servers, failed verifying subscription status, failed keeping user signed in, unceremoniously exits on users.
 CS is trash from India. Run arounds, ineptitude, couldn&#x27;t have a fuck attitude and it shows in their responses.
 I think by now there should be great alternatives and I just want some examples that are deployed successfully without any issues.

                              <span>Hi,
 Recently i was asked to configure DMARC in our company.
 I see that we have a lot of SPF allignment issues (25% fail (Some of them are permerrors because we have 14 lookups and no spf flattening). But the biggest allignment issue is with outlook.com. This is weird because we have: include:spf.protection.outlook.com in our SPF record, also the Outlook ones are NOT permerrors.
 Some examples of the microsoft domains that the envelopes are from:
 eur05-vi1-obe.outbound.protection.outlook.com
 eur05-db8-obe.outbound.protection.outlook.com
 eur04-he1-obe.outbound.protection.outlook.com
 Did anybody have the same issue or know what the solution might be?

Ethernet on PC works fine, same for dock on any other device. I&#x27;ve updated BIOS, dock Firmware, Ethernet drivers (and downgraded them to) without any success.

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Right now I am in a pickle and I need to figure out the best way to get tons of testing results from production lines, index them, and share them with our biggest customer. Problem is that I kinda have 2 days to do it. 
 O was thinking about a solution: Shared Drives &gt; Power Gateway &gt; Flow &gt; Power Automate &gt; Sharepoint &gt; Index &gt; Azure Guest account and be done with it. 
 Problem is that I do not have a Power license and I can&#x27;t get one that quickly. So now I need to replace Gateway with syncing on-prem to OneDrive and then run copy flow and everything cloud only. 
 What do you think? Install OneDrive on FS and manually put local folders to sync or create a VM, map the drives and run sync outside the FS? Or maybe a third solution? I am afraid that changing folders to Sync mode can f*up the NTFS rights, paths, dedup, or anything else. 
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Does anyone know if this is an industry thing or if it&#x27;s just companies in my area? Every job I try to join has had an either 6mo-1yr &quot;we can fire you for any reason&quot; clause in the contract I&#x27;ve had to sign for onboarding.
 Edit: I didn&#x27;t realize this but I guess Montana(the state I live in) is one of the few states that isn&#x27;t an &quot;at-will&quot; state so if companies don&#x27;t have a probationary period (6mo-1yr) they have to actually provide a reason to fire someone, they can&#x27;t just fire people without cause.

                              <span>Hey guys, 
  
 i have next year my exam and i need a project.
 One of my ideas was that I could integrate a software to monitor our Switches.
 If a device it connected to a switch, then I want to see the following things: MAC-Address, IP-Address, VLAN-Tag and the Device name.
 My idea is that with the Software installed on a Raspberry PI I put one in every patch room. So that it automatically reads the port and I just need to enter the room.
 Maybe a web gui to see it from my office.
  
 Is there a Software you use? Or ideas you have to this?
 For my exam programming is not so necessary because its not the main part of my training for the Job. 
 So I hope there is a software I can use.
 Kind regards
 Lennart

 We don&#x27;t have IT people in the ground yet and need to do things remotely.
 Does the community have any good supplier to recommend?
 We can&#x27;t go with supplier like Amazon because of internal rules... 
 Some help would be much appreciated.

 Long story short, insurance company wants us to up our password policy...fine
 Old admins used the default domain policy...this policy had a lax policy.....
 To ease users into things we created a temp policy and applied it to the MyOrgUsers OU. THe gpo was enforced and place on the top of the link order. However the default domain policy keeps winning despite it not being enforced.
 TLDR....Default Domain Policy that is not ENFORCED is winning and not letting our custom password policy apply settings. Also I changed the default domain policy password to not defined and that did not work. 
 Have to say in 15 years....this is a first for me.

 Is there any way to deploy SSL Identity certificate from central point to all machines that contains Windows, Linux and Mac OS.
 The same goes if we want to deploy CA certificate for browser in Linux machines
 Thanks for your input.

 ​
  
Free (and open source if possible)
 Able to perform active scan
 Timings related to active scans should be configurable in order to avoid false positives from IDS
 Able to work ad defined time intervals
 Last but not least, able to work with OT protocols (modbus, profinet, etc...)
  
Do you have any suggestion?

 We have the basic azure free platform in our company and am trying to retain user&#x27;s data (Exchange, one drive) more than 1 month, so I configured retention policy for couple of users as a test (pending to be deleted), from what I know and read the retention policy should work and retain user&#x27;s data after I (Unassign the license) &amp; (delete the user account) so two criteria should be met.
 But I don&#x27;t really understand the field which is says (Start the retention period based on) and there are two options (When item last modified) and (when Item last created) may I get elaborate scenario for this point? and what&#x27;s the effect of it I thought the retention period would start after the user would be deleted without license.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 Someone offhandedly mentioned here that you could order dedicated Att business fiber in order for them help with the cost of running line/build out (they offer 10k budget) then switching to a significantly cheaper shared business fiber plan once the circuit was in place, is that really a thing? I looked at the early termination fee for business fiber and it mentions that, &quot;The ETF is calculated at $25 x the number of months remaining in the term.&quot; Normally the dedicated plans run 24 month terms, so eat a $575 fee (23 months) then switch to a cheaper plan seems more economical as long as you don&#x27;t need the SLA and Att would recoup their cost but just on a longer time period. 
  
 Currently, the building already has a Att fiber trunk in the MPOE, but were somehow too cheap to run a handoff to each unit. The previous tech confirmed they have tagged and turned on a port for us on their equipment like so but we have no conduit or straight line running from MPOE to our unit. So the buildout cost would be to just run conduit and line to the unit as the main trunk is already in place. Just not really sure if dedicated circuit can be repurposed for shared later on with a setup like ours. 
 Thank for any insight

                              <span>Hello fellow redditors,
 I hope you are feeling great and have a nice and quiet day.
 Let´s get to the topic: Many of my users (including myself) have noticed a horrible decrease of performance for the whole system, as soon as one starts to share his/her screen on a Teams meeting.
 Everything takes way longer to open up and the whole system starts to feel some kind of unstable. Everything you click on has a high latency.
 We have allready checked the performance monitor on the computers. The only thing that was noticable was that Teams consumpts arround 15 - 30 percent of CPU usage (for a 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 as an example). Neither the SSD, GPU, RAM or other components seem to have a higher workload. It´s just the CPU, but anyway it´s by far not at 100% workload.
 I googled arround and found out that this problem seems to be well known for many people but nobody seems to have a solution for it.
 ​
 Does anyone else encounter the same behaviour of Teams or maybe even have a few hints for us or a solution for the problem?
 ​
 Thank you in advance!
 ​
 ​
 Edit// I forgot to mention that all of our computers at least have a 10th or 11th gen i7 with 16GB RAM and a m.2 ssd.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 Just wanted to ask. Anyone go for Microsoft&#x27;s Cybersecurity Architect exam? I&#x27;ve done all prereqs in preparation. Passed SC-200, SC-300, AZ-500 and MS-500. MS-500 probably was the hardest IHMO.
 What should I expect in SC-100, since it&#x27;s a fairly new exam.

                              <span>How many hours a week does it take you to manage 7 esxi hosts (35 vms total across them)
 Trying to get a rough time estimate for how long it takes to manage 7 esxi/VMware hosts with 35 total VMs (combination of windows and Linux) on them.
 We don&#x27;t need to actually manage the operating system of the VMs, just storage/ram/CPU and networking.
 The things I wondering about are how many hours a week it takes to manage: 1. Updating esxi hosts (new esxi firmware and os) 2. Updating esxi configuration 3. Updating OSVM configurations 4. Securing and preparing for security evaluation for esxi/VMware.
 Just ball park numbers or how many people you have working on that level of infrastructure.
 Edit: for people asking ... I am an admin. Management is telling me I need take over a new vsphere cluster. I am telling them that it&#x27;s a lot of work on top of the admin work I am already doing.

                              <span>I keep reading articles trying to understand MTU and people are saying if your ip MTU is set to 1500 that means the largest packet that can be sent is 1500. Now if you are getting fragmentation then you should lower the mtu. But the thing is fragmentation occurs when you need to split the packet into multiple in order to not go above 1500. So why would you lower the mtu to 1400 in that case it doesn&#x27;t make sense.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got eve-ng installed in google cloud with the following topology
 [33.33.33.33] vm-instance(mgmt cloud) [10.1.1.2] ---- [10.1.1.1] router [192.168.1.1] ---- [192.168.1.2] server (ubuntu)
 I want to put a simple web server machine listening on some random port (65000 for example) and be able to do the following:
  
traffic initiated from internet to 33.33.33.33:65000
 vm-instance (ubuntu os) should take this internet traffic, change the dest ip to 192.168.1.2:65000
 send traffic to router and router will forward it to the web server
  
My questions are: is this possible? and what nat/ip table commands would I apply on the vm-instance?
 ​
 ---
 note: The server can access the internet because I enabled ip forwarding and applied a NAT rule on the vm-instance (server &gt; router &gt; mgmt cloud &gt; internet)

The only section I am nervous about is coping the certs from existing ASA to new one is there anything I need to be cautious when dealing with migrating certificates. The ASA is primarily used for AnyConnect.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I am currently going through Fortinet certifications (NSE 1,2,3 certified already &amp; starting my NSE 4) but I&#x27;m wondering if these certs will bring me any value in the future, I work in a small MSP with 200 ish clients and we use FortiGate for the clients. Hence, my intention was to complete up to NSE 7 (Fortinet Cloud/Azure Cert) to improve my knowledge.
 I&#x27;m wanting to know if this is worth my doing &amp; if it will get me noticed for future jobs in the long run over other certifications.

                              <span>What are some steps or tools to troubleshooting a Cisco corporate environment VPN? I have access to Cisco DNA, SolarWinds and ISE. I just started this job as a network admin and seems to me that users are complaining about file transfers being slower than normal for a variety of applications within the past few months. I read about different versions of Cisco AnyConnect causing issues and updated a user to have the most current recommended version with no success. We currently aren’t configured for split-tunneling. This is scheduled to be configured in the future. It seems we are getting a high amount of dropped packets but I am really trying to find a tool to find out what limiting the VPN connection/speed. 
 Thank you,

                              <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;ve been searching all over the place and I seem to be looking for a specific traffic generator.
 I&#x27;m wanting to test SSL decryption performance on two vendor firewalls at our DR site, with a need to generate x number of stateful SSL connections to say, example.com over time to simulate user traffic at our HQ.
 I looked at packet sender, but the packets always fall into the &quot;Do not decrypt&quot; bucket and don&#x27;t seem to tax the FW.
 Any thoughts or suggestions? TIA

                              <span>Hi guys. We are setting up transport links between our two sites. Currently we have a 100g NNI setup with carrier1.
 For this transport links we are getting L2 circuit from carrier2 and Eline on our carrier1 NNI. We want to run LACP on these two links.
 Problem: Our existing Arista switch (where carrier2 is connected) lacks support for LACPDU passthrough. Is there any economical 100gbe switch that support lacpdu passthrough? Or is there any way to make it work on Arista?

                              <span>Hello,
 These days servers doesn&#x27;t have RS232 connection. To connect to network device console interface (for example Cisco NCS-5501-SE) I&#x27;m trying to use some kind of &#x27;4world&#x27; USB to RS232 serial converter. And seems it works very buggy... the typing is slow and the letters are &#x27;thrown out&#x27;. Almost impossible even to login. So i&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;re any additional command to make USB-to-RS232 serial converter work better ? Because without converter it works OK&quot;
 To connect without adapter i&#x27;m using this command - and everything is OK:
 screen /dev/ttyS0 115200 cs8,-parenb,-cstopb,-hupcl 
 When changing connection to USB adapter mode - same settings, i just change the device naming to USB0:
 screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 cs8,-parenb,-cstopb,-hupcl 
 and the shit starts to hit the fan.
 I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s the adapter fault, some additional settings should apply ? Or the USB-to-Serial adapter suppose to work badly ? 
 Thanks

                              <span>I know network segmentation is one of those things that has no standard solution.
 We are planning to add two separate pairs of firewalls, one for data center and other for perimeter.
 The DC firewalls will pair of PAs 5200 and perimeter pair Fortinet.
 I am wondering which firewalls (DC or Perimeter) can be used for segmenting internal campus network. We have some internals VLANs for HVAC, BMS, IoT and Smart Devices and want to make them go through a NGFW as gateway.

                              <span>We have a distributed ISE deployment with 2 PANS and 3 PSNs, one of the PSN&#x27; SSL cert has expired. Our Internal CA has generated a new cert but we&#x27;re not able to add it back in as the Intermediate CA that signed the cert has renewed its cert 6 months ago. Thus the newly generated cert is not accepted as the trusted CA on the PAN has a different serial number (old one) to the one that signed new CSR. 
 As it stands, we will have to replace the Trusted Cert (the intermediate Win Server) with the new one. Then apply the new Cert to all the other PSNs, This means we&#x27;d have a total outage across our estate. 
  
Is there another way to replace the expired cert without doing all of them, Our Windows team have advised they will not be able to sign/generate a cert with the old intermediate CA. 
 Also while we do this, how do we ensure the pre-authorised machines will not have any issues? (we have authentication open on the port as well a &quot;authentication event no-response action authorize vlan&quot; but this will drop the traffic into a guest vlan.

 I really would like to work as IT in manufacturing and have a degree already in an unrelated field to IT. It&#x27;s an associates in industrial maintenance technology. 
 Is IT different in manufacturing settings? What about PLCs and robotics? Does IT configure these?

 Recently i was asked to configure DMARC in our company.
 I see that we have a lot of SPF allignment issues (25% fail (Some of them are permerrors because we have 14 lookups and no spf flattening). But the biggest allignment issue is with outlook.com. This is weird because we have: include:spf.protection.outlook.com in our SPF record, also the Outlook ones are NOT permerrors.
 Some examples of the microsoft domains that the envelopes are from:
 eur05-vi1-obe.outbound.protection.outlook.com
 eur05-db8-obe.outbound.protection.outlook.com
 eur04-he1-obe.outbound.protection.outlook.com
 Did anybody have the same issue or know what the solution might be?

 I wanted to have a hackable NIC card. It should not discard any incoming frames. Are there any such NIC providers? I know these cards allows frame with FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF mac address inside the network. I wanted to enable a few other MAC addresses too. Any solutions?

                              <span>OK, first of all, I am still considering this and not sure if I should do it. I am looking for advise if this is feasible at all
 I am a IT professional, but mostly datacenter oriented. I did build some wireless networks; based on UBNT hardware (usually up to 100 people).
 In my free time, I help out NGO&#x27;s and like wise organization with my expertise. One of those NGOs is organizing a small conference (200-300 people) and have a desire to have a seperated WiFi network and not use the hotel network (1. because hotel networks are not always stable, 2. security is not always up to par/sometimes shared with other guests)
 I am now designing a potential network to see if this project is feasible, as tell them if I can do it or not.
 I am considering UBNT, as I know the software/hardware and it is easy to configure for me. Its a temporary network, so speedy deployment is important, using UBNT will help with that.
 Below is my initial plan and looking for feedback if this will produce a stable enough network: 
 There are two floors in play here (F1 &amp; F3, F2 is not used/not part of this) 
 Floor 1
 - Room 1: 64m2/20 people, 1 AP
 - Room 2: 64m2/20 people, 1 AP
 - Room 3: 128m2/40 people, 1 AP
 - Attrium, 1600m2, 300 people, 6 AP 
 Floor 3
 - 4 rooms of each ~100m2/50 people, 1 AP each 
 Total: 13 APs, probably order a few extra to fill in potential gaps. Probably will we rent the equipment. 
 People have one or two devices, so I probably need a /22. Disable client-to-client communication, to limit broadcasts/ARP-traffic on the network. Alternative would be to split it in smaller subnets, but people will roam around, so I think that is not convenient. 
 Build up time, 1-2 days. It will be running a lot of wires.... 
 Looking forward to read that I am crazy to consider this. ;-)

                              <span>Hi guys,
 Someone offhandedly mentioned here that you could order dedicated Att business fiber in order for them help with the cost of running line/build out (they offer 10k budget) then switching to a significantly cheaper shared business fiber plan once the circuit was in place, is that really a thing? I looked at the early termination fee for business fiber and it mentions that, &quot;The ETF is calculated at $25 x the number of months remaining in the term.&quot; Normally the dedicated plans run 24 month terms, so eat a $575 fee (23 months) then switch to a cheaper plan seems more economical as long as you don&#x27;t need the SLA and Att would recoup their cost but just on a longer time period. 
  
 Currently, the building already has a Att fiber trunk in the MPOE, but were somehow too cheap to run a handoff to each unit. The previous tech confirmed they have tagged and turned on a port for us on their equipment like so but we have no conduit or straight line running from MPOE to our unit. So the buildout cost would be to just run conduit and line to the unit as the main trunk is already in place. Just not really sure if dedicated circuit can be repurposed for shared later on with a setup like ours. 
 Thank for any insight

 I was doing bit a a study on MP-BGP EVPN based VXLAN. I have these doubts which are still not clear after going through some articles. Can anyone please help?
 How does L3 VNI learns the Host IP Addresses and IP Prefixes available on Local VTEP and also from Remote VTEP?
 For Remote Learning, i learnt that the VTEP learns Host MAC Addresses from Remote VTEPs through MP-BGP EVPN Type-2 route advertisements. Is the same Type-2 EVPN Route Advertisement used to exchange Host IP Addresses and IP Prefixes?
 What is the purpose of EVPN Type5 Route advertisements?

                              <span>Hi Folkes, Can you please help me clarify my following doubts on TCP Congestion Control?
 While studying TCP Congestion Control, i came to know that Sender starts with Slow Start phase where it starts sending some amount of Send MSS and upon receiving acknowledgement, the sender increases the Congestion Window.
 Some Articles say that the sender adds one more MSS to Congestion Window and some say doubles it doubles up the Congestion Window. Which one is true?
 Also, when the Congestion Window reaches the Slow Start Threshold or some Packet Loss is detected, the Sender ends the Slow Start Phase and moves into Congestion Avoidance Phase.
 Can anyone clarify how is the Slow Start Threshold Value calculated? Is it a configurable option in OS Kernel or Registry settings?

                              <span>We&#x27;re finishing the implementation of a new Cisco 9800 (All CAPWAP) development using ISE for TEAP and guest cwa. A brand new ask is for contractors with non AD machines to be able to authenticate. Trying to figure out if the following is possible or a pipe dream.
 Contractors hit the guest network (default gateway is our Palo Alto firewall which handles all security and routing for guest). Redirect to ISE, log in with AD creds. Traffic then hits the Palo (since it&#x27;s the gateway) and the Palo then assigns access based on the AD account used in the ISE portal.
 So... 1. Capwap to controller cwa to ise 2. Login ad to use portal 3. Ise passes user info to Palo which then tags secpols by user name
 I did find this but haven&#x27;t had time to do any testing yet https://knowledgebase.paloaltonetworks.com/KCSArticleDetail?id&#x3D;kA10g000000Cm5sCAC

                              <span>Hello,
 I am running into a brick wall here with our DMVPN configuration that was originally setup by people long gone from the company. From what I&#x27;m seeing we have a traditional hub n spoke configuration with BGP as the dynamic routing protocol. On all of our spoke routers I can see two NHRP NHS&#x27;s Output below (The old ISP public WAN IP that needs to be replaced with our new ISP public IP &amp; and the 2nd that should stay). I am having an issue with where to go to re-configure this first NHRP NHS NBMA address.
 10.XXX.XXX.3 E NBMA Address: XX.XX.XX.XX priority &#x3D; 0 cluster &#x3D; 0
 10.XXX.XXX.4 RE NBMA Address: XX.XX.XX.XX priority &#x3D; 0 cluster &#x3D; 0
 I can see the locally connected route from the hub to the 10.XXX.XXX.4 in this case, but not the .3
 ​
 How do all spokes know about an NBMA address not being advertised by the hub? Does a brand new tunnel need to be created on the hub with the new public IP?
 Note - There is a switch connecting the 2 WAN IPs to the hub router.
 For whatever reason a &#x27;Show IP NHRP NHS&#x27; command on the hub shows me nothing.
 I also named this post dual isp redundancy and not dual hub. I&#x27;m hoping I don&#x27;t have to create a new hub.

                              <span>Good day. I posted this same question in r/sysadmin a few days ago and got some good info, but I am seeking more opinions from this group now as was suggested. 
 We are looking at replacing our current Wifi environment (Ruckus) spread over about 6-10 buildings/sites with something newer. I am curious about the pros and cons of various modern systems (ruckus, meraki, cisco, ubiquity, aruba, juniper, extreme etc) and what fellow network admins have experienced in recent years. What do you like and dislike about a particular product, what should we look out for, etc? 
 I would like this new build to let us take a wifi first approach, so I&#x27;d like something rock solid, good performance and security, and hopefully somewhat affordable. We currently have 1gbps PoE switches, but once their lifecycle is up we could certainly get 2.5 or 5gbps ports to support future growth. 
 Thanks

                              <span>Background: we use OSPF as IGP protocol for the underlay and then BGP sourced by loopbacks in each of the VTEPs/pods.
 For the BGP process I thought I could only activate the l2vpn family because I need to distribute just MAC addresses, no IPV4 routes. On Huawei S5700 switches it seems that if the ipv4 family is not active everything stops working though. I thought I may generalize and just say &quot;activate the family you need and nothing else&quot;; if you need not IPv4 then shut it down.
 Is really like I descrived above or is there an explanation for that? Or might it a bug of the OS on the S5700? 
 TIA,
 Pan

                              <span>With people getting more laptops, there&#x27;s a need for more flexible connection types in our building. While NAC is somewhere in the pipeline, I wanted to implement a stopgap measure to help with people roaming through the offices and attending meetings.
 Setup is as follows: users can connect to a Wi-Fi as guests through a captive portal and after that connect to the VPN if they need to take their PC away from their table and cable. Works fine, but people moan about logging in twice to get to work. I would say it&#x27;s not that big of a deal, but if I can help someone out, why not?
 On our vWLC I&#x27;ve set up a pre-auth ACL allowing connections to our VPN endpoint. While I get hits on it, AnyConnect gives out a message:
  
The service provider in your current location is restricting access to the Internet. You need to log on with the service provider before you can establish a VPN session. You can try this by visiting any website with your browser.
  
Fine, I must&#x27;ve forgotten to add something that&#x27;s also needed, let&#x27;s try with &quot;permit any any&quot; line... Gets hits, still can&#x27;t connect or browse the web.
 I&#x27;ve tried it with my phone and with my laptop, same experience. According to WLC clients are in &quot;Security Policy L3 WebAuth In Progress&quot; stage which seems fine (and timeout is set to the max amount which is 4 hours).
 Anyone had a problem like this and solved it? I have no idea what else I should be doing to make this work.

                              <span>So this is quite an odd issue I&#x27;m having and I&#x27;m not even sure it&#x27;s the right place but here we go...
 I am an electrical engineer and I worked in a program called SKM. In order to access it I have a USB stick that acts as a network license. It is plugged into my PC, my PC sees it, and when I open the software it checks to make sure before allowing access. I pay for a few seats of these software, all of which run through the USB network license. It maintains count of how many people are accessing it.
 I have a few remote employees who VPN into my network. In order to access the software they change a few settings in the SKM files per their (SKMs) direction, log into the VPN, and it sees the license, good to go. Except one employee.
 For some reason this one employee cannot &quot;see&quot; the network license once he is logged into the VPN. I went over to his house, brought my laptop, connected to the VPN, only to have the same issue. My laptop could not &quot;see&quot; the license either. 
 I have spoke at length with SKM about the issue and have tried every recommendation on their end. They have simply chalked it up to some network issue, which I&#x27;m beginning to agree with after troubleshooting. 
 The license uses something to check and i go to localhost:1947 to check. Not sure what this changes, just stating it as a fact. I&#x27;ve tried looking into the network adapter settings, etc. but I really don&#x27;t know if what I do will help as I&#x27;m not that informed on networking issues. 
 For the record, server side and user side firewalls are all off. Other employees do not have this issue, and neither do I when I am remote from my main office location. I am pretty green in this and know enough just to get into trouble, so be nice if the solution is something simple/stupid.
 ​
 Can anyone recommend any other steps to check or files/checkboxes to look into? TIA

                              <span>We are designing a network for our new site. It&#x27;s a big medical center with 6 floors. As you can see in the design, we have drawn a separate block for CCTV network. There would be approx. 400+ cameras (indoor &amp; outdoor) with high quality imaging throughout the building. When designing this network, we thought would it be better to implement a three-tier network access, distribution layer and core just for CCTV block. But the rest of the campus network remain collapsed 2-tier network
 In the end I&#x27;m only asking this:
 Would you implement a such architecture? Does it make a difference if we just separate the access for CCTV and connect them to just Cores and eliminate the distribution part.

                              <span>Hey all, I&#x27;m working on a fairly large enterprise network (3000ish users under this core) and currently I&#x27;m having trouble with our core node. There&#x27;s a whole bunch of other stuff happening with it (like how I can&#x27;t ping any VSI - even if they&#x27;re up) but the most baffling to me is that I can&#x27;t ping the loopback address at all. 
 It&#x27;s a Cisco 3850 stack with 7 members. 1 master, 1 standby, and 5 line cards. I have Loopback0 configured with an IP of 10.0.255.4 and no matter what, I cannot ping it. Even if I console into the router and use 
 ping 10.0.255.4 source Lo0 
 it times out. Isn&#x27;t the loopback supposed to be working, even if nothing else is? All it has is the ip address command in its config. 
 Additionally, I can&#x27;t ping ANY VSI on the device, even though all of them are up. We have a few dozen and they&#x27;ve all been working as expected, but starting this morning we can&#x27;t ping any of them. Here&#x27;s an example :
  Interface Vlan148 ip address 10.0.148.1 255.255.255.192 no ip redirects no ip unreachables no ip proxy-arp  
 There&#x27;s also some netflow commands but they&#x27;re long and I didn&#x27;t really feel like typing them out. I doubt they&#x27;re relevant. 
 Anyway, a computer under Vlan148 (148.17) cannot ping its gateway (148.1) yet it DOES have full access to the whole network internal and outbound. I&#x27;m completely lost. 
 Even more weirdly, the device (when console&#x27;d in) can&#x27;t ping anything itself, yet still sends SNMP logs, registers devices in the arp cache, creates OSPF neighbor entries, etc. 
 This is just so strange. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
 EDIT: Partially resolved the issue. Turns out VRRP was causing this somehow, as disabling the VSIs that use VRRP fixed the issue. Tomorrow I&#x27;ll have to figure out why exactly VRRP did this, but for now, it&#x27;s resolved.

                              <span>Our group has ordered a few of the Extreme series switches. My question is: on this switch, how do the shared ports at the end work? At first I thought they might be specifically for LACP, but it appears you can put any ports on the switch in a LAG. Also, if you run the &quot;show port&quot; command, it shows 28 ports, not 24, and you can put them into different VLANs. For example, you can have port 24 in VLAN 100 and port 28 in VLAN 105. 
 TLDR; are there functionally 24 ports on this switch, or 28?

                              <span>We have to re-IP an entire data center network and I&#x27;m wondering if a high-end DC switch can provide 2 VLAN IP addresses on 1 port. Basically put 2 IP addresses on 1 server ethernet port and then turn off the retiring IP from that interface. If this could be done it would save us a lot of pain with having to have both a tech on our side and a DC tech involved in over a thousand servers.

                              <span>Netflix has a fictionalized account of the development of Spotify called The Playlist. The story is told through the eyes of different stake holders: The founder, the music industry, a lawyer, including an Engineer. While fictionalized, the series does seem to be based on real characters, real events, and what seems to be real tech issues/hurdles. 
 Spoiler alert if you want to watch this. One of the technical breakthroughs per the story seems to be using lossy streaming where they accept a small amount of packet loss in order to avoid latency. I presumed all streaming services do this, but of course Spotify development started in the mid-ish 2000’s and maybe they were one of the first. At any rate, the engineer proclaims this a wholly new protocol that they have patented. But isn’t lossy streaming simply UDP? Can anyone speak to what protocol Spotify supposedly patented (assuming the patent is not also fictionalized)?

                              <span>Hi All - we are moving from an onsite data room in a corporate office to a colocated facility. What are people doing these days as best practice? Are you just leaving a Firewall with an Ethernet switch and a UPS for the corporate users users to join a LAN while doing site-site VPN to the data center with a xfinity line or is there some new hotness to get this done? SD-WAN seems overkill for us.
 ​
 The corporate office is very close to a data center in Atlanta so ping would be &lt;15ms. User count in the office would be 15 tops, and they currently all use (including all of our servers) a single 100/100Mbit line confirmed with no congestion issues. New data center connection to the world would be gigabit, so plenty of bandwidth there.
 Do people still typically leave behind a DC and a NAS? Nothing but a firewall? Direct connect? We run light SQL loads, AD and VOIP, that&#x27;s about it. There are two other corporate offices in the US connected via site-site VPN and the other sites are OUs in Active Directory. In each site, there is a physical DC as well as virtual on esxi - and esxi obviously hosts all of our servers in each site. There is no shared storage for esxi, it&#x27;s all local to each site. Considering moving to RD Gateway model for the users who have been used to local LAN speeds for all applications as some are a bit rough via WAN (such as document management).
 Thanks for any ideas!

                              <span>Hi, wr are looking to upgrade our access switches for our campus.
 We have been running with multiple USW 24 switches, however we are in need of something a bit more reliable.
 No fancy features is needed. 
 Must have: -Double AC PSU slots (replaceable) -2x SFP gbe ports -PVST/VSTP -24x gbe rj45 ports (a poe alternative would also be good) -rackable -preferably fanless
 Do you guys have any recommendations for pure l2 switches that have atleast the above specs?
 My budget is about 1k euro per switch (preferably less) :)

                              <span>Okay, I think this is a straightforward question. I have a location in my EIGRP WAN topology with a secondary WAN link. I want this secondary link to advertise the LAN networks learned from the local L3 LAN switches, but I want to use the reliability metric at this duel circuit location to make routes advertised from the secondary links a feasible successor. 
 All Routers in the EIGRP WAN are only configured to consider the Default metrics (BANDWIDTH/LOAD) when calculating the best path.
 Now, describing this in writing has already made me feel like the answer is &quot;no&quot; because the other EIGRP neighbors would not use this new metric when calculating the best path. It may make more sense to modify the LOAD metric. I think this would mean the routes may not be installed as feasible successors, but they would be used if the primary Router failed. 
 What are your thoughts and ideas?

They are recommending me stuff to do (mostly internal resources) and I am going back to school for a cybersecurity focus but looking for some other good options to do on top of that. I am a sales engineer so I need to be able to more closely relate to customers. I am in the packet inspection for network performance and service assurance space if that helps with recommendations.

                              <span>Hi, me and my colleagues cannot come to a clear conclusion on this, we have some clients that are experiencing connectivity troubles when trying to use an IKEv2 VPN, the culprit seems to be a MTU size issue.
 The solution would be to change the MTU size but, we&#x27;re split on where we want to perform the change. Me and some others advocate that after a PPPoE session is established between a CPE and the BNG the traffic is ethernet so the mtu size should be changed on the interface we use for eBGP peering. 
 Others insist that is enough to change it on the bba-group that is applied to the template on the BNG.
 I am not sure why that would help, could anyone help clear things up?

                              <span>Hi girls and guys, thanks for taking the time to read this.
 I need to set up a camera system for a recording studio I&#x27;m working for. They want to install PTZ cameras in the whole studio, as well as monitors in two of the rooms, so that the monitors can show any feed taken from any cameras in the studio.
 I was thinking about buying Video Encoders &amp; Decoders and PTZ Hdmi Cameras:
 Camera HDMI Out --&gt; Encoder --&gt; Network --&gt; Decoder in the other room --&gt; Monitor HDMI In 
 But that means that for every camera, I need to buy an encoder. And that gets expensive really quick.
 My question: Could I buy a camera with an ethernet port and plug it in the network directly, then retrieve the feed with the decoder to show on the monitors? Or is an encoder mandatory to be able to do that? Do you guys maybe have an easier solution to this?
 Thanks a lot, really appreciate the help.

                              <span>Hi,
 How can i remotely change wan ip + default route to the fortigate with single wan port while remotely connected via wan without disconnecting.
 Option 1: Can i add secondary ip-address to the wan port and then add new static route for the new gateway?
 Option 2: Can i just add another static route (new wan gateway) for the new wan connection and then change the wan interface ip and then connect via new wan ip?
 Can someone explain step by step what i have to do. New wan ip is on different subnet.

                              <span>Hello all, 
 I am using VRRP. (MAC and IP&#x27;s made up). 
 VRRP interface has mac bl:ab:la:bl:ab:la 11.11.11.1
 Active Router 11.11.11.2
 Backup Router 11.11.11.3
 Client is 11.11.11.21 with gateway 11.11.11.1. 
 When Client visit website, there is HTTPS traffic incoming. 
 What I see is that the Client recieve HTTPs traffic from 11.11.11.1 MAC-address. But ALSO recieves the HTTPs traffic from 11.11.11.2 MAC-address. 
 Is that wrong? I expected that the MAC-address of VRRP interface would be used downstream. And not sometimes the active-router MAC-address.

                              <span>I am in the position we all talk about on this sub which has received me the opportunity to fix something where money is not the issue. 
 First, the story, since starting in my role the team has used a shared excel file to manage our IP Space, we have over 300 Remote sites and 4 DCs... and one Excel file. I had mentioned time and time that eventually we&#x27;re going to go out, build a site, and accidentally use the IP Space that has already been reserved for a different site. Well, the day came, we had our 3rd Party go out and deploy the site as per our instructions, and bang, one of our other sites went offline. Two sites had been deployed using the same Subnet. The team did their testing, PVT passed and they left for the day. Staff started moving in the next day. I then get a P2 the next day, site down, I can&#x27;t login, and everything down. ISP says they see their side online. Then.. it all comes rushing in, it hits me and all I can do is just sigh take and sip of my coffee.
 So with that, all told and shared, what do we all use? I have only used phpIPAM before, it worked but it wasn&#x27;t great and crashed a bit.. I&#x27;m hoping to purchase something, easy to setup easy to use, and easy to maintain, the golden 3. phpIPAM was none of those things.

                              <span>Hi all
 I am kind of stuck with a customer where I have got myself into configuring one of the customer switches from cisco to aruba 6300F. (no reasoning here)
 Basically, stuck with this sample scenario and I am looking to see what should the vlan config look like on the &#x27;x&#x27; port on the switch?
 https://imgur.com/a/WBKKTD7
 i have tried doing the following and it doesn&#x27;t help. Can someone please give a hint from the image attached? Or maybe some documentation/video to explain this kind of setup?
 vlan trunk native 2 tag
 vlan trunk allowed 1
 and 
 vlan trunk native 1
 vlan trunk allowed 1,2
 and a few other combinations. 
 Thanks in advanced for help.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a multimode fibre run, and now I am looking into transceivers. Locally I can get 1310nm transceivers and 850nm transceivers for about the same price.
 The 1310nm transceivers state that they are rated for 2 kilometer runs, while the 850nm transceivers state that they are rated for 550 meter runs.
 Are there any downsides to using the two 1310nm transceivers on both ends? 1310nm seems to be better

CRITICAL Severity. This affects common configurations and which are also likely to be exploitable. Examples include significant disclosure of the contents of server memory (potentially revealing user details), vulnerabilities which can be easily exploited remotely to compromise server private keys or where remote code execution is considered likely in common situations. These issues will be kept private and will trigger a new release of all supported versions. We will attempt to address these as soon as possible.
  
As far as I can tell, this affects RHEL9 (and anything based on it) and Ubuntu 22.04

 I wasn&#x27;t part of the earliest days of silicon valley. I grew up watching them, wishing I was just 10 years older.
 My first computer was a Commodore 64. Then I had a Packard Bell w/ an Intel 486DX4 80Mhz, Windows 3.11, 8MB of RAM, and a 600MB HDD. We upgraded the HDD to a whopping 4.2 GB, added another 16GB of RAM, and eventually upgraded to Windows 95. My first modem was 19.2Kbps. I watched the first &quot;dot com&quot; bubble burst. I was an unabashed geek who loved learning things, but I could never wrap my head around math skills. I was told there was no way I could make it in &quot;computers&quot; because of my weak mathematics.
 I went off to college, got a degree in English because I thought I was going to be a school teacher. Couldn&#x27;t find a job as a journa…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m a System Admin at my current company and we just hired a new IT Manager about three weeks ago. Before even being caught up to speed he&#x27;s been constantly trying to gut all the solutions we currently have in place and replace them with solutions that he&#x27;s familiar with. To an extent it&#x27;s understandable but largely seems like he&#x27;s trying to pass business off to friends but that&#x27;s a different conversation lol. 
 One of the solutions he&#x27;s trying to implement is Ivanti which is understandable for MDM/UEM. Though he&#x27;s trying to implement other solutions of theirs that they don&#x27;t really excel at. Mainly for the reason of just having everything under one solution provider. I&#x27;m more of the mindset of choosing the best solution for that specific need (i.e. MDM, SIEM, AV, VPN). Each company and their requirements typically vary which requires a more tailored approach rather than a blanket it one. 
 My question is pretty simple; What&#x27;s your experience with Ivanti? 
 I&#x27;m trying to understand the company/solution and it&#x27;s pros/cons so that I can go into the next conversation with the ammo I need to setup the company for success. Whether that be understanding the benefits and going with Ivanti or arguing against it.

                              <span>To cut to the chase, the company I&#x27;m working for (~50 people fintech startup) is moving to a new location, and I (sysadmin, but practically responsible for anything IT related) am supposed to be in charge of moving our entire wiring and network infrastructure. To be honest I&#x27;m quite intimidated by the task, not only because the previous IT manager (who initially set everything up) did not leave any proper documentation, but also because I just graduated college last year, and I&#x27;m only in my current position because said manager left and the company has been unwilling to hire someone to replace him. In other words, I severely lack both experience and guidance. 
 So far, it looks like I have two options:
  
Convince the company to hire the previous manager as a contractor to help with the move. The negotiation will likely be difficult, since the higher-ups still have some ill feelings towards him. But in my (unexperienced) opinion, he should know best about what&#x27;s going on with our setup.
 Hire an IT service provider. I have never worked with one, so I am unfamiliar with pricing etc, or whether it&#x27;s even standard for them to take on something like this. 
  
Basically... what the heck should I do?
 Any advice would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 Last year I was hired as a sysadmin after having succeeded as a sysadmin elsewhere. I replaced one who had basically given up at the role and let things go well beyond unmanaged. I spent the first 6 months improving every process I could, and met every project I was given. After that I thought of a few projects that I could work on that didn’t require any budget changes, since anything involving a cost I get stonewalled on. 
 But now it’s a year later, and as systems admin I still don’t have access to many of our systems. I don’t have access to our email spam filter. And when I’m on group calls involving my management I’m hardly given a chance to speak, and they do my work on the call instead of letting me, making me feel like I’m in some sort of placeholder position. 
 Having the title longer on my resume is nice, and work/life balance and the pay is okay. But I don’t feel like I’m respected or trusted to have the tools to do my job here. 
 It’s gotten to the point where I’ve begun collecting evidence of my requests that go unanswered, so if I’m ever terminated I can prove I didn’t have what I needed to succeed. Do you think it’s better that I stick it out for another year for that job history/resume experience, or should I look to leave as I’m really no longer learning or able to work on progressing my career here? I am studying to take some cyber security certs to help pad the resume though.

                              <span>I work on a cloud project as part of the operationsteam. Our developer teams need some kind of S3 storage and we tried using minio. As a first review I can say that this application is not usable because the operator is horrible and the helm chart is not compatible with Openshift. How do you handle S3 storage in Openshift? Are there some alternatives we could check out?

                              <span>So I’m a system security engineer at my company. Sometimes we get the most random tickets assigned to our queue that don’t belong to us. So I’ll send it back to the service desk to figure out where to route the ticket. I had one of the senior service desk guys tell me “we aren’t the catch all for all IT issues”. Umm actually I’m pretty sure that’s the purpose of the help desk. To be the first point of contact for IT issues and either resolve the issue or escalate to the team that can. Also, I’ve worked service desk. I started from the bottom, so I know what it’s like.

                              <span>So deploying software MSIs via GPO is pretty straight forward. However, what happens when you get an updated installer?
 So let&#x27;s say in June the software vendor releases v1.0 of their software. Create the GPO and deploy the MSI, easy.
 In August they release v1.2 and you need to upgrade everybody. Are you supposed to:
  
Add another installer to the same GPO, leaving the original so that the new one is an &quot;upgrade&quot; to the previous version, or
 
Remove the previous installer, allowing it to remain on old machines and then add the new installation package.
 
 There are articles everywhere about making the initial software deployment, however, it seems nearly impossible to find anything on upgrading an installation.

                              <span>This could be a little bit off-topic but I gotta ask. I used to be a well-focused, hard-working student back in the day. After I got into the field and started earning I slowly lost that focus. I mean I work really hard and focused at the office because I freaking love IT but I can&#x27;t focus to study. 
 I want to do a few certifications and even get my master&#x27;s but sitting down and studying is like torture now. Even tutorials don&#x27;t work. I get terribly (even intentionally) distracted all the time. I believe it&#x27;s because we are so used to stimulation when we work in IT (screens, terminals, GUIs, incidents), our brain gets bored when we study. Does that make sense? Have any of you encountered this? How do you focus on studying for certs when your brain says &quot;nooooooo!&quot;? How do you get that &#x27;student mindset&#x27; back and focus?

                              <span>Hi!
 I need a program to help me visualize and filter the Windows (Windows Server 2019) event logs related to files. I work in a small company with a tight budget and since this is for my convinience I don&#x27;t want to spend any money on this. I just downloaded ADAudit, which is great, but the file auditing is only in the premium version.
 Any recommendation for free software that can help me monitor the file events?
 ​
 Thank you very much!!!

 Our MECM running Version 2207 is having trouble installing and approving clients in our child domain. Clients discovered in our parent domain are not experiencing any issues. New clients in our child domain are not installed after being discovered. If we install the client manually, the device comes up as a &quot;?&quot; in SCCM and are not approved. If we approve manually, the device comes online.
 I&#x27;m not exactly sure when this came up, but I discovered this issue this past month. 
  
Auto approval is configured correctly under hierarchy settings
 Default IIS permissions for CCM_System_WindowsAuth Windows Authentication is enabled and set to HTTP 401 Challenge
  Boundary groups are set properly

 I&#x27;m fairly certain this is caused by the HTTP SPN for CCM_POST being registered …</span>

                              <span>I understand the purpose and effect of certificates within Trusted Root Certification Authorities, Intermediate Certification Authorities &amp; Trusted Publishers...but what about the others (Enterprise Trust, Trusted Devices, Web Hosting)?
 Are these all purely for personal preference/organization purposes, as in it doesn&#x27;t really matter if you have your certificates exist in &quot;Personal&quot; or any of these sub-folders? For example, I know Remote Desktop authentication certificates can be placed in &quot;Personal&quot; (machine store) and RDP connections will utilize the certificate even without the certificate existing in the &quot;Remote Desktop&quot; sub-folder.
 The reason I&#x27;m asking is that I&#x27;m needing to move some domain Server/Computer related certs out of the &quot;Personal&quot; folder to somewhere more appropriate and was wondering if the &quot;Enterprise Trust&quot; folder would be the right place for those?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to clean up my Group Policy .admx and .adml files but I am having trouble telling which folder and files are actually being used by AD GPO. Is there not a way to find the object path of a referenced GPO? I basically have duplicate files and want to remove them.
 My current folder structure on the domain controller looks like this:
  
Root folder with GPOs: \dc-1\SYSVOL\domain.com\Policies
 Then under that directory, I have about 80 folders that look like this {12A244F0-51EA-4C20-A1BA-68DF5BEA7E8E} and a PolicyDefinitions folder.
 Then, in PolicyDefinitions, I have about 400 .adml and .admx files and then a folder called en-US which has about 500 .adml and .admx files in it too.
  
I noticed when updating ADMX templates, if I over-write any, then I usually get errors when navigating the policies in the Group Policy Management snap-in. It will say something like the GPO is missing, then just restore the original GPO files from a backup copy of the folder I made to fix it.
 Note: I don&#x27;t want to delete all unused GPOs, I just want to delete the duplicates from the unused folder (whichever one that is). I understand that some GPOs wont be in use but that I also dont want to delete them because then they wont be available.

                              <span>I have a pretty typical two-tied Active Directory PKI setup with an internal web server that hosts my CRLs. None of the servers are accessible from the internet and it all exist on internal namespaces. All of my servers and desktops internally can get to the CRLs.
 I have had two sites using internet web server certificates getting flagged by Chrome with the error &quot;NET::ERR_CERT_UNABLE_TO_CHECK_REVOCATION&quot; while Edge is seemingly fine. Additionally, the error doesn&#x27;t present itself on Chrome for all users. The same person could walk up to two machines and get the error on only one, and a profile wipe will fix the error completely for a while. 
 I can load the certificate, copy the AIA and CRL locations and download them just fine. I have check pkiview.msc for any troubles and everything looks fine, I can&#x27;t seem to find any issue with the PKI infrastructure. 
 Chrome and Edge seem to be acting differently while unmanaged Firefox doesn&#x27;t like anything signed by my internal PKI. Would there be any additional logs I can check to find out why Chrome is complaining about not being able to check the CRL and/or can someone help me understand CRLSets and if they might be the problem?

 3 Locations in Canada and 2 in the US. 
 I help manage all of them, there is a seperate person to manage the ERP and tht is all that they do. And then there is the IT manager and me, thats it. 
 I do all the onboarding, user setup, help desk. Manage the cybersecurity side of things (firewalls, endpoint security etc. I roll out new apps, set and configure gpo’s. Help with backups and restoration( had to manually free up space on the backup server because the manager forgot to before he went on vacation). And recently have been helping the erp guy with the operations side of the iseries because he isn’t good at it/can’t do it. When the manager isn’t here, everything falls to me.

                              <span>Hi We got a Sharepoint Online Assets Library which contains all of our Office templates.
 When I update or reupload a template, it doesn&#x27;t sync to people who has been using this template before. It seems to be some kind of cache because if I rename the document to something else, it works fine.
 The templates have never been replaced or updated before. So i&#x27;m curious on how to manage these templates... it&#x27;s not very intuitive to give the template a new name every time it has been updated.
 I have tried to clear etc. Word cache but it doesn&#x27;t work.

                              <span>Hi im currently writing a Oracle 8 Kickstart file for our company and i need to automatically create a file after installation and write in it. This is what i tried :
 cat &gt; /etc/sysctl.d/disableipv6.conf
 net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 &#x3D;1
 net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 &#x3D;1
 EOF
 ​
 but it somehow messes up because the file created looks like this 
 &#x27;disableipv6.conf&#x27;$&#x27;\r&#x27;

 Problem is: We&#x27;re also sending internal mails from i.e. our VeeAm Backup Server which also gets flagged as external.
 Now, to exclude mails from &quot;ourdomain.com&quot; I&#x27;d like to test if spoofed mails won&#x27;t get flagged although coming from outside our org. Is there a legit (and maybe even free) tool or website to use for this?
 Most I found looked VERY fishy.

 I know the first week is all insurance and getting signed up. I am a big believer in documenting and observing for making big changes but maybe I need a different perspective on what other people value or would start off with. thanks and curious to see what people say.

 what would you recommend me?

                              <span>... and I am baffled that I did. I tell my clients all the time to be careful with suspicious mails. And I guess this time I wasn&#x27;t careful enough. 
 The original mail seemed to originate from their web hosting provider stating a new invoice was ready for download and contained an HTML file as an attachment which should be the invoice itself. It was forwarded twice within their org, then to me with a request for credentials to access that site since it prompted for them. The website was an absolute perfect replica of the genuine login site and prompted for credentials. I filled it out planing to download the invoice and send it to them, since I knew the sender didn&#x27;t have them. However the login didn&#x27;t work. After checking the url I was on the correct site of the provider. What I didn&#x27;t notice at first: I only got redirected there after entering the credentials. For some reason I got suspicious at that point and checked the HTML file which contained some encrypted java script. Of course I immediately changed the password of the account and fortunately found no suspicious activity. 
 However I am still in shock how stupidly I behaved.
 Edit: just to add, that Mail did not trigger any spam filter nor did opening the HTML file trigger the antivirus or the webfilter of our firewall.
 Edit 2: just uploaded the file to Virustotal and it seems it&#x27;s actually a trojan. However it&#x27;s still undetected by our antivirus solution. This file was first uploaded to Virustotal a week ago.

 bounces+584721-8c22-USERSNAME&#x3D;OURDOMAIN@em2170.THEIR DOMAIN.neton behalf of THEIR COMPANY NAME surveys@THEIRDOMAIN.net
 So unless I whitelist your whole domain, it WILL always get blocked as spam. Why can&#x27;t you just send it via your surveys@THEIRDOMAIN.net address? Which I&#x27;ve already cocking whitelisted!
 Having never done this before myself so is this laziness or is it general practice and we just have to accept it and whitelist their whole domain?

 i already made a simple form connected to power automate, and it sends the inline manager a mail when an employee submits a request, and they can approve or decline the request from teams/outlook.
 is there any other way to do this? my deadline is in 2weeks

                              <span>I am running into an annoying issue at work, we deploy laptops with autopilot and intune. When we start a new laptop and connect it to our network it get stucks at the windows message “sit back and relax while we work our magic” if we leave the laptop on it stays stuck forever.
 What we found out us that as soon as we remove the docking connection we get prompted to connect to wi-fi and then autopilot kicks in.
 The wi-fi is public so we looked at our firewall logs to see if the fact that deployment get stuck only when on LAN connection is caused by firewall but we don’t see any blocks.
 Is there anyway I can get to some logging on the laptop to see why it is stuck?

                              <span>Hopefully there is someone familiar with the ESE/JET engine who could confirm about cleaning up ESE database transaction log files.
 One AD CS CA is having a rather large C:\Windows\system32\CertLog directory with numerous ESE log files. It seems to be a rather known issue that AD CS does not (sometimes?) clean up the ESE log files, for example:
 https://www.sysadmins.lv/blog-en/database-log-files-are-not-truncated-when-you-perform-a-full-certification-authority-database-backup.aspx
 The reference is contradicting itself. It says &quot;no workaround&quot; but also gives a command that &quot;identifies the start log file number to protect&quot;. I had already figured out about as much by using esentutl but would like to confirm I am getting this right.
 In the above linked example all logs with sequence number smaller than 3B, meaning edb00001.log until edb0003B.log could be removed, right? What about edb.log, that one must not be touched? Or one cannot just delete any log file and have a working database?
 It should be rather simple to make a script that:
  
Run esentutl /mk edb.chk
 Parse the Checkpoint line for sequence ID
 Delete all edb#####.log files with ##### smaller than value from step 2
  
I have been searching for a while and could not find one website about actually doing this. Surely someone must have done this before, it does not even look that complicated?! Several hits for just brutely stopping certsvc and deleting all logs which is not what I want to do if this can be done &quot;right&quot;, by just deleting unnecessary log files.
 I guess I could just download the whole CertLog and play around with it, see what happens. Will take a while, it being multi-GB...

                              <span>I am getting so frustrated with a certain vendor&#x27;s customer service every time I report a problem with our laptops. They drain so much energy out of me and send me into loops just to &quot;fix&quot; software problems, which are 99% hardware problems and we just need someone to change the parts that&#x27;s it. I have such a hard time to get through to those people even though I try to fix everything software related beforehand, but the support always wants more from me. 
 How do you guys deal with customer support? My manager says I should be harsh, but I don&#x27;t feel like being rude to a guy who is just doing their job and fend off stupid problems. Maybe I am just too soft, I am lost at this point.

 5 days ago, I made a thread about several issues I had with my new setup of Windows 11, mostly about printing issues:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/y8s2x0/windows_11_unusable/
 Well, diving deeper into that, found that the print queue is unmanageable from the Config app, dropping the message of the title, and this seems to be the root of the problem. It also seems that I&#x27;m not the only one with the issue:
 https://answers.microsoft.com/es-es/windows/forum/all/necesitas-una-aplicaci%C3%B3n-nueva-para-abrir/fdb08d24-a862-40a5-9592-a98c6ffbbe2d
 https://www.reddit.com/r/WindowsHelp/comments/yaj17o/print_spoolerprint_queue_suddenly_shows_this/
 Any fix (powershell command?) to assign the link type to the app?
 And second...
 Given that both results are from the last 7 day…</span>

                              <span>Hello,
 I am confused: back then we moved from scripting (.bat) to nice Group Policies for connecting network file shares.
 Now, as I am digging deeper into M365 and Intune I can&#x27;t find a nice, as easy to use solution, like the Group Policy.
 As I see from my researches, we are now back at scripting the network file share connection but now with PowerShell?
 So even in scripting: We move from a Net Use &quot;One Liner&quot; to a 317 Line PowerShell Script which adds a local task for reconnecting a single drive? (using https://intunedrivemapping.azurewebsites.net/).
 Maybe I am thinking the wrong way, because modern management and cloud is totally different but:
 Microsoft offers Azure Files as a File Server replacement. These Shares also need to be connected.
 I have a Client with 5 TB of data, whic…</span>

                              <span>No, it´s not about their printer line, that topic has a special place in my &quot;not to be opened again&quot; box. 
 It´s been nearly two decades since I last bought any HP product for good reason but as life goes on and people think it´s ok to purchase HP products I have to troubleshoot them. 
 First the server guy got blamed - me. 
 Than the network guy got blamed - me. 
 Than the software got blamed. So I made contact with the vendor who told me that the network guy needs to get his hands on the problem. The logs stated that also, at least the software ones. So I conceded and went back to troubleshoot even though I was pretty certain it´s not the network, most certainly not the server and probably not the software. It runs on several devices without any issues. 
 After another sleepless night it dawned to me that the only difference is, that the software is installed on a HP desk. So I grabbed just another device, slapped the software on and it runs. It just does, what it´s supposed to do, it works. So it´s the HP trash again. Why? I don´t know. I wish I could say that every single HP device is in it´s own contained part of the network, isolated from the rest of the world and hidden from any tech guy but they are everywhere and the rules applied are the same as for all the other stuff. The one and only difference is, they are HP desks. 
 I honestly don´t know who made the cost-benefit analysis or if there even is one, but I´d like to see which maniac decided to buy HP products.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve ran into the manual folder shuffle in exchange all too frequently over the last few years. 
 Awhile back, I found this random script online made by David Barrett - I think this is the single most powerful and complete script I&#x27;ve ever found via ze google lifeline.
 I encourage you to read the github and check it out for yourself.
 Merge MailboxFolders.ps1 · David-Barrett-MS/PowerShell-EWS-Scripts Wiki · GitHub 
 ​
 I just really wanted to take a moment and publicly thank this guy - Hopefully he reads r/sysadmin
 You could package this script into a full app and make a fortune -- instead, this guy updates and provides this script for free for anyone to benefit.
 and sure enough, it supports oauth/modern auth
 Thank You David Barrett. You have saved quite possibly hundreds of hours of my life.

                              <span>Just wanted to know if there is an existing documentation on what are the best practices for the preferred number and size of disks attached to a VM. I&#x27;m aware of the maximum values but that doesn&#x27;t mean we should implement it, right?

Password reset, clearing cookies/cache, having to point out their lack of VPN connection is why you can&#x27;t get access to this resource/intranet, etc. I understand this is mostly a sysadmin sub and if this breaks any rules or frowned upon for non sysadmin to post, I&#x27;ll delete.
 I work remotely so physically seeing and talking and getting to know your local sysadmin is even harder than it is.
 I had simple questions to ask him to gain some personal perspective on how he got to where he is now.
 And I was immediately shot down by my supervisor, being told to please do not contact him, only supervisors and up can do that.
 And you know what? I sorta get it. I would imagine having 10s or even 100s of agents contacting you could get tiring.
 But it still sucks that I&#x27;m pretty much forbidden to gain a little wisdom from him. Oh well.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a tad confused by Microsoft&#x27;s documentation on this topic.... I&#x27;m looking at doing a proof of concept for a possible project to migrate ALL user, group, resource data from one tenant to another and there appears to be two different pathways - both updated within the last 6 months by Microsoft and neither has any reference to the other (with the exception of recommended content).
 ​
  
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mailbox-migration/migrate-mailboxes-across-tenants vs https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/cross-tenant-mailbox-migration?view&#x3D;o365-worldwide 
  
 ​
 Which is the better method?
 Notes: 
 The primary domain in the source tenant will remain as the primary domain for the users migrated into the target (and ONLY for these users, everyone else already on the target tenant will use the company&#x27;s normal domain).
 The source tenant is only 3 months old but user accounts contain data and calendars migrated from an on-prem Kerio server.
 Both tenants have their own Mimecast Email Gateway, but after migration is complete, there will be only the target&#x27;s Mimecast service.

                              <span>HOW???
 Please share with me something :/ I have been just a hobbyist in computers since I was a kid, I guess. Building my first computer at a young age, growing in to help-desk after flipping them burgers for X years after college.. A typical story, I assume...
 Was on helpdesk in large org for 5 years, now I have been a SysAdmin for a year and some change (Age 31) and I have been overwhelmed by the sheer infinite amount of things you need to learn. My feelings gravitate to &#x27;why am I even doing this?&#x27;..
 My boss is amazing. My team is amazing. I have finally landed a kush job with a description that I thought I always wanted (small shop now doing some networking, security wherever, being new to virtualization, everything a sysadmin would do with an IT team of 3 in the datacenter and 300 employees).
 My motivation is fucked. Every day I want to do good for my co-workers and boss but I just don&#x27;t feel like I have it in me to learn and think and be creative every day... I just had a very overdue vacation a few months ago and I already have this burnout feeling.. whyyyy.. I question if I am even interested in IT.. working in the dirt or cleaning toilets can NOT be a better deal for me but it is what I fantasize about. something mindless...but idk.. I can continue to rant but I think anyone reading this get&#x27;s the point. Work is getting hard and I want to be motivated.
 (Possible remedy? Can changing my habits and routine give me a better outlook? ie start waking up earlier and getting some exercise. Can I coax my mind in to enjoying this job by employing other changes in different parts of my life?)

                              <span>Hey all - 
 Have had a s2s tunnel built between site a &amp; site b for quite some time... never seemed to be a super big issue, performed well, but lately I feel like there are times where bandwidth is just yuck... I know it&#x27;s a broad question, but I have a maybe 7 subnets going across this to 3 or 4 other subnets at the secondary location. AES256 and SHA256 for algorithms with DH14. Not sure if this is a factor? But looking to understand if this is a best solution for site to site locations still or if there is something else I should be pursuing... This area is not my number 1 - so forgive me. Both units are Fortigate. Both sites are on 1000/1000 fiber... Just seems like I can count to 4 before I see anything load up like an SMB query on a file server... etc... but latency between sites is a solid 5ms.... 
 ​
 Cheers

 I originally saw it listed over on /r/internetisbeautiful. 
 This guy made a site that scrapes Twitter for job postings in the past 48 hours, and sorts and publishes everything. It&#x27;s got built-in filters for location, remote, categories, etc.

                              <span>Hi all
 so i am tasked to disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1 and only using 1.2 for security reasons on all our windows server machines 
 this is what i am going to do, please correct me if i am wrong 
 1- Disable TLS 1.0, 1.1 from internet options 
 2- Run power-shell script to set the registry keys as described in this url
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/reference-connect-tls-enforcement#powershell-script-to-enable-tls-12
 again, the reason is to keep our windows servers secure as server and client there is nothing specific
 thanks in advanced

                              <span>I was at a position for about six years then left for greener pastures. About four months after I left I got a call from one of the users. She called just to say thank you and she really appreciated the support I had given her while I was there, and that was it.
 She was just one of the 300ish users I supported, never had any extensive dealings with her, never anything beyond answering the phone/Teams when she called for support.
 Meanwhile, the guy who owned the company, the guy who was supposedly my boss to whom I was supposed to report to, after keeping his company running 24/7 for all those years never talked to me while I was there, &quot;negotiated&quot; with me when I turned in my notice by sending verbal messages through somebody who then relayed them through HR who then verbally passed the message to me.

                              <span>Yes it happened. This gentleman, let&#x27;s call him G, is part of the operations and is good at tech. I had an hour discussion with him on how important is the security for the organisation and how are we planning to implement ir. He was really impressed with my ideas and knowledge. Right after our call he sent an email to my managers, company&#x27;s CEO and HR head. HR head then later forwarded this email to all 2000+ employees.
 G you really made my day and gave me so much motivation to work here.
 Of course I am hoping for a good raise in salary in next appraisal cycle else I will switch Lol. 
 Keep up the good work dear SysAdmins.

While I&#x27;m sure their service is wonderful for those who need it, their attempt to win clients by attrition has completely blacklisted them from our acceptable vendors to use. They call, they email, they leave voicemails. For 5 years this has been going on, if not longer. I tell them we don&#x27;t use VMWare, and I tell them we aren&#x27;t interested and yet they still harass us. And that&#x27;s the best term. It&#x27;s harassment at this point.

                              <span>Early last week PC across our org starting having one of three types of error:
 1 - PC would BSOD, possibly multiple times with no obvious cause and disparate error codes
 2 - Every application would crash in turn with an error indicating issues with Trend Micro&#x27;s dlls
 3 - PC would boot to a black screen, but be online (even on wifi) and respond to remote commands (though any form of remote control would still yield a black screen)
 Eventually issues 1 and 2 would evolve into 3 in many, though not all cases. An upgrade of TM&#x27;s client was complete or in progress at the time of the first presentation, which coupled with issue 2 made us conclude a botched update was the cause.
 Unfortunately repair didn&#x27;t seem to work and TM&#x27;s support suggested we proceed with a hard uninstall using their CUT program. The problem was this took an extremely long time (over a day in one notable case). We dug through the logs and discovered CUT was attempting dozens of tries with long timeouts for each operation, before eventually failing and moving to a more aggressive option (ie removing a service after failing to stop it).
 We discovered that an ini file was created upon launching the CUT executable and we could, if we were quick enough, replace that ini file with a modded one that reduced timeouts and # of attempts to something more manageable. This brought down removal time from hours to about 20 minutes per machine, which could be run in parallel.
 On some machines CUT would complete on first try, others would require a second application even though CUT logged its successful completion.
 After that we could reinstall the TM client with no further issue.
 TM support told us this has never happened before (when does it ever) and we&#x27;re the only ones reporting it (what good luck), so I thought it&#x27;d be useful to put it here for anyone that should happen to suffer this issue or something similar.

                              <span>Has anyone had any success reinstalling/resetting Windows Defender in Windows 10?
 We use crowdstrike as our main AV but would like to start using scheduled scanning on our devices per recommendations from our SoC.
 Our devices are in Intune, and I’ve found out that Defender will automatically run in “passive Mode” if we onboard our devices to Defender for Endpoint.
 This works fine on our newer deployed devices (via autopilot), but it won’t work on our previous ones that were “imaged” using MDT. I have a feeling that the previous image broke defender somehow since it included crowdstrike on the install, rather than installing after enrolling via autopilot in the new deployment.
 I’ve tried the commands I’ve found online to reset the app using AppX, re-registering it again using add-appx using the built in windows 10 manifest.xml, and resetting the app via “Windows Settings”. I’ve also tried restarting the Windows Defender service, modifying registry entries to enable “passive mode”, and simply enabling periodic scanning on the device itself. Windows defender seem to just won’t start at all. I checked group policy and Defender is not blocked.
 Any other ideas you guys may have to get defender running again? I could try uninstalling crowdstrike, but thats not really feasible if it’s the only way to deploy it on our older devices.

                              <span>I&#x27;m mid-career in my 30s and about to be unemployed in a few months. I know I can get another admin or DevOps type job but I&#x27;m curious what is folks&#x27; thoughts on what will be new in-demand roles in IT in the coming years.
 I&#x27;m not talking about learning an app (for example Chef and building cookbooks) or generic stuff like automation (for example learning Python for scripting). I&#x27;m thinking like where will AI be or quantum computing and what kinds of roles there will be for the admins.
 Big industry-changing stuff like when Windows 95 came on the scene and the world hustled to move to distributed systems hiring anyone who could spell PC. Or when Amazon released commercial cloud computing and suddenly the &quot;cloud engineer&quot; title was the fat paycheck.
 Or maybe I just say screw it to cutting-edge tech and get a job supporting the Mainframe and COBOL? That stuff will be around long after I&#x27;m retired. Plus from what I see folks to support that is in very high demand.

 I was doing MX switch last night, because I was changing security email provider to MS, and I forgot to remove a transport rule in Exchange Online. Now, I have a lot of incoming emails piled up as Failed due to transport rule blocked them all.
 What can I do? How can I see or recover these emails?

                              <span>Hello!
 ​
 Im a entry-Level Sys-Admin and doing a Server upgrade at my workplace right now.
 We are switching from a Terra 7220 G1 to a 7220 G4, and are using VMware for Virtualisation.
 The G1 runs ESXI 5.5, which I plan to Upgrade to 6.5/6.7 before migrating the VMs to the G4 Server, which is expected to run ESXI 7.X on it.
 ​
 Therefore i need to know wheter my Hardware is compatibel with ESXI 6.5
 I already went to Vmware Hardware compatibility Guide to check it, but the list ends with a Terra G2 modell. 
 ​
 Does anyone know how to find out if my G1 is compatibel?
 Its equiped with 2x Intel Xeon E5-2600-v2 Series, which are supported by ESXI 6.5/6.7.
 Or do you think I should just try to upgrade?

                              <span>I&#x27;ll get straight to the point, we have been receiving bulk spam emails (100-400) at a time at my job using a legitimate email address from one of our users. Exchange picks up on it and blocks the legitimate email from sending emails since it is flagging it as spam. This disables and user and the only way to get around it is to create a rule in Exchange with a &quot;body contains&quot; rule. We use MWB Nebula to locate vulnerabilities and I do not see one on our Exchange server. I am a Jr. System Admin so Cybersecurity is something I am learning. I believe this would obviously be a Blue Team issue. We do have a vendor we work with for issues like this, but would like anyone&#x27;s input if possible. Any more info just ask.

                              <span>Hello
 We have a bunch of WMware VM&#x27;s with BIOS firmware but goal is to get them to UEFI. We found that we can convert the disk using MBR2GPT.exe, but it brings an unexpected issue, the EFI partition is created at the end of the disk and the main partition is not extendable after that :(
 Also i could put MBR2GPT.exe to a MECM task sequence which boots into WinPE, converts the disk and shuts down, which is convenient.
 Has anyone faced a similar issue? How did you solve it? How to automate this as much as possible so that EFI partition is first on the disk?

                              <span>Any idea how to route outbound emails of our domain xyz.com via Proofpoint. Inbound relay is setup and working correctly. Also, our domain is not hosted on &quot;Managed servers&quot; and our MTA is provider like Bluehost or GoDaddy. 
 Mail provider says we cannot store a smart host through which all outgoing e-mails should run, and you can only send via (mail provider).

When the caching server tries to fetch a file from the Azure Files shares you get an error on the client with &quot;Invalid file handle.&quot; as you can see in the following link: https://imgur.com/a/Ro4N1pX.
 Microsoft has confirmed that this has happened to several other customers as well.
 Keep you posted.

                              <span>I am tasked with securing UAC for our clients, based on recommendations from an audit.
 Can anyone tell me how &quot;User Account Control: Detect application installations and prompt for elevation&quot; actually works?
 Enabled: Application installation packages that require an elevation of privilege to install are detected and the user is prompted for administrative credentials.
 Disabled: Application installation packages that require an elevation of privilege to install aren&#x27;t detected and the user isn&#x27;t prompted for administrative credentials.
 ​
 Microsoft says to set it to whatever fits my environment, CIS Benchmark says to enable it. But: Auditor actually recommends disabling it.
 So, which one is more secure? Does &quot;Disabled&quot; mean additional packages are simply not installed at all or does it install them without a UAC prompt?
 Thanks.

 I would like to know if any of you is actively working in France and hado to deal with what i wrote in the title.
 A friend of mine said he could not install an RMM software on his company computers, unless he update and present a document to the &quot;Economic and Social Committee&quot;.
 Thats new for me, and i would like to dig more on this matter, but i could not find any specific info.
 ​
 Thanks in advance for all the answers!

                              <span>Hi, Can anyone help me or give me an idea how to fix current problems with AppData Redirection?
 So heres the scenario: Our client has Active Directory, and we implemented Folder Redirection via GPO for all users (even AppData) and now it creates so many problems that i have no idea what to do. 
 For example: User is logged out from apps whenever he logs on other computer. He logs with his domain user on one PC then logs off and then logs on the other computer. When he logs off and comes back to his main pc and logs onto it, he is logged out in every app he was logged in. Google Chrome doesn&#x27;t work properly, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t even want to open.
 Do I remove AppData from Folder Redirection? Are there any other solutions that allow to load Users Profile on different computers? Maybe Folder Redirection should be completely removed?
 If i missed something that you need to help me, tell me in the comments, English isn&#x27;t my first language so sorry about that.

Forest Trust;
 Two-Way;
 Forest-wide Authentication; 
 DNS have each other zones as secondary
 Both domains at forest function level 2008. 
 Domain A has one master DC and when Global catalog redundant, both in windows 2016
 Domain B has one single DC on Windows 2008.
 
  
From Domain A to Domain B all is super. I can assign permissions to either network shares or remote desktop service access at will on both domains.
 Now from Domain B to Domain A, If a network share is within a Domain A machine, all is super again. I can assign permissions to both domain users.
 Now here comes trouble:
  
if the network share is on a Domain B device, i can list domain A just fine, but when i&#x27;m about to assign a permission i get the error that the domain controller can&#x27;t be found (but wait a minute you just gave me the complete list of users a moment ago?!);
 If i need to assign remote desktop permission to a domain B machine, again i can list all the users on domain A just fine, but when i&#x27;m about to commit the assign to a domain A user, again the error that DC couldn&#x27;t be reached.
  
I have recreated trust countless times, i have deleted and reassigned DNS zones both as secondaries and as Conditional Forwarders, to no avail any help?
 EDIT: &quot;The Active Directory Domain Controllers required to find the selected objects in the following domains are not avaiable: Domain A. Ensure the Active Directory Domain Controllers are avaiable, and try to select the objects again&quot; 
 Hello?! Who gave the list that i picked a specific user in the previous screen? c&#x27;mon man...

                              <span>Hello r/sysadmin fellows. I need some opinion about my career path. For basic information, I&#x27;m not based in US/EU but in Southeast Asia. 
 My current occupation right now &quot;IT Implementer&quot; for a branch of multinational animal feed manufacturing company (that is our main product, although our product lineup are diverse, from animal feed, poultry breeding &amp; abattoir, dairy products and FMGC). The &quot;official&quot; work is L1/L2 Helpdesk supporting three business units in two separate location which account to 150-200 endpoints. But as I joined the company three years ago, my responsibility has swelled up a lot. Aside from helpdesk, now I do VMware (Hosting out Win2016 and Win2019 DNS, DHCP, RODC and Local fileserver), AWS (for our critical ERP), maintaining APs, CCTVs(!!!!), developing our homebrew …</span>

                              <span>We have a machine that keeps upgrading to Windows 11, despite putting the registry keys in place to keep it on Windows 10. Last week I moved it back to 10, then cleared the update catalog and rebooted multiple times, even running manual updates and it didn&#x27;t update. The machine was then turned on at the weekend and has updated to Windows 11 for the 3rd time.
 Their server is 2012R2 so we&#x27;re trying to keep the machines on Windows 10 until the new one is installed, does anyone have other methods of blocking the updates? I have been informed that installing the ADMX to try the group policy method just caused other issues with the server, which is why I went down the registry route.

                              <span>edit colleague mentioned he has also seen it on his infrastructure using windows 10 LTSC 1809 so apparently it&#x27;s not specific to servers only
 I&#x27;ve seen this problem for quite some time and always ignored but I guess it&#x27;s time to figure out how to fix it. So I&#x27;m looking for any advice on how to proceed with fixing it once and for all.
 Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve looked into:
  
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Keyboard Layout\Preload has correct number of keyboard layouts - the two I&#x27;ve set (00000409 and 00000419, English and russian) - as expected
 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Keyboard Layout\Preload has English only (00000409) - as expected
 
In settings &gt; time and language &gt; language I only have two languages selected, 1 keyboard layout each - as expected
 
powershell&#x27;s Get-WinUserLanguageList returns two languages, 1 keyboard layout each - as expected
 
 And yet, there are three keyboard layouts to select from in tray - being two I&#x27;ve selected and 1 extra called QAA, which is basically English.
 Logging out and back in again doesn&#x27;t fix it. Rebooting doesn&#x27;t fix it. The only way to fix it is to override current settings - either using powershell or manually resetting up all that. But problem appears again sooner or later - maybe next reboot or maybe 4 months in - appears to be random.
 Googling leads nowhere as all there either temporal fixes that I&#x27;ve mentioned or common useless advice like &quot;run sfc scannow&quot;
 Has anyone figured out how to get rid of that problem permanently?

                              <span>Help my sanity... I&#x27;m not a Dell guy.
 Is there a way to remotely force a physical drive into down state on a Dell SCv3020 array?
 One disk in the array has very high (&gt;300ms) latency and filling the log with &quot;[Aborted]&quot; messages but for whatever reason the array controller hasn&#x27;t taken the disk out of the RAID. The high latency on one disk is breaking everything connected to the array.
 I can only find &quot;Release Disk&quot; in Storage Manager but that is trying to rebalance the RAID by moving the data away from the failing disk which will take a very long time.
 I&#x27;d like to force the disk into failed state without rebalancing. I know I could pull the disk, but I&#x27;m trying to avoid a long car journey.

 I am trying to troubleshoot an issue for a customer where our screen sharing solution requires port 7100 to be open in order for it to work correctly however, with this particular customer we&#x27;ve found that their managed devices are not working. We can bring in unmanaged devices on their network and our software works fine but it&#x27;s only when we try and connect using their managed devices do we get blocked. 
 We&#x27;ve disabled their Sophos AV, apparently they&#x27;ve had a look at their inbound/outbound ports on Windows Defender and can&#x27;t see any blocks on 7100 so my question is - how else can we find out what&#x27;s blocking this port? Any scanning tools that will point us to some kind of GPO or other application block?

 I&#x27;m unable to setup the Process Explorer to run at startup via Task Scheduler. Regardless if I create the task via the Process Explorer menu &#x27;Run at startup&#x27; or manually I am unable to make it work.
 I&#x27;ve installed Systeinternals via winget: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  
winget list sysinternals
 Name Id Version Source
 Sysinternals Suite 9P7KNL5RWT25 2022.10.1.0 msstore &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
  
Running the task does nothing and there are no errors in the task history log. It is as if nothing happens. &#x27;Run with highest privileges&#x27; also does nothing What I find very odd about the installation is that procexp.exe is a 0kb file in the Local/Microsoft/WindowsApps folder. It has no icon but I can run it normally by double-clicking on it. However if I use Task Scheduler and I try to selected it (via Browser on Actions) I get the following error:  procexp.exe The file cannot be accessed by the system. 
 Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.

                              <span>we&#x27;ve recently started to move our default deployed image to win11. We&#x27;ve since noticed that activation is behaving weird and so far i cannot get to the bottom of whats going on.
 We deploy our image via ConfMgr. Enterprise version is selected from the iso as a untouched image. All our changes are done via GPO or CM after the iso. Originally it did not have a key defined (overlooked/assumed AD KMS would take over), but thats now been corrected in the Task Sequence.
 I stumbled on the fact my laptop is one thats affected; it&#x27;s using the Pro retail key thats burnt into UEFI. ok - no problem; slmgr /upk, /ipk {GVLK}, /ato and /dli to confirm. /dli shows the expected KMS activation from AD. Great, job done i&#x27;ll get that pushed out to existing clients via a Task Sequence that runs those same commands. A week later i noticed my laptop is back to the pro licence (i reboot weekly; sleep the laptop during the week)
 redo the slmgr process, reboot and now the key has reverted back to the pro retail key again.
 has anyone seen this behaviour or know why it&#x27;s occuring?

                              <span>Friendly redditors and fellow sysadmins, I need to prevail upon your assistance on this fine Monday. 
 I am attempting to identify a specific planning tool that I have encountered in the past, but cannot for the life of me remember the name of. My Google foo seems to be pretty bad today as well.
 In summary, this is a tool published by a company (can’t remember the name) that allows you to pay an annual license fee to get access to part libraries from various vendors and then use these to build BOMs to submit to suppliers. I know it has libraries from Aruba, Cisco, Extreme, to name but a few. 
 Before anyone says it, I am not thinking about Visio or anything like that. This tool allows you to select e.g. an Aruba CX6300 switch and then can show you which addon modules are compatible with this switch and would then allow you build a complete BOM around this, including PSUs, SFP transceivers, interconnect cables, etc.
 Please, if anybody knows this tool, I am trying to identify it, as I need to submit budget approval for it.

                              <span>Hi!
 ​
 I need to use Microsoft Excel on a Windows Terminalserver for about 30 users.
 Currently, there is no Azure Active Directory in use (and not planned).
 ​
 Office 365 seems to be the easiest option, but I do not want every user to have to logon daily &quot;manually&quot;. --&gt; Is there any possibility without AAD to automate the logon?
 ​
 My alternative seems to be Excel as OpenValue with SA.
 ​
 Are you aware of any other option?
 ​
 Thank you for your help

                              <span>Hi There , 
 ​
 ​
 I have a scenario and couple questions 
 ​
 Here is the following configuration of the two organizations:
 ​
 Organization 1:
 ​
 Exchange 2013 CU23
 ​
 Organization 2:
 ​
 Exchange 2016 CU19 &amp; Hybrid 
 ​
 Both organizations have an internal connection between them and a Full Trust Relationship.
 ​
 ​
 I am very confused related to the Organization Relationships.
 ​
 I have found an article like below.
 ​
 https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/the-hybrid-mesh/ba-p/605910
 ​
 MS says:
 ​
  
Create an Organization Relationship between Contoso on-premises and Tailspin on-premises. Use a unique SMTP namespace for the domain name in the Organization Relationship like OnPrem.Tailspintoys.com
  
Note: In most environments, the shared namespace “TailspinToys.com” can be used as the Target address for on-premises users and you would not need the additional namespace of onprem.TailspinToys.com. However, to account for all complex partnerships that could be in place, a unique namespace used as the target address will ensure free busy works properly.
 ​
 Note: The domain name “TailspinToys.com” is not present in any of the Organization Relationships in the Contoso environment. Keeping this name out of the Organization Relationship will ensure that you can continue to use the shared namespace and see free/busy information.
 ​
 ​
 ​
 ​
 Do I have to use unique address like OnPrem.companyb.com? Because We dont have any DNS record such as OnPrem.companyb.com. I want to use companyb.com as domain name for Organization Relationship between Company A on-premises and Company B on-premises. 
 ​
 thanks,

 First of all, English isn’t my first language, so sorry about any mistakes i make. We have an On-Premise Exchange 2016 running on a VM. I received two support tickets declaring crashes after importing company contacts into own contacts. Outlook then loses connection for about 10-15 Minutes. Can anyone help me with this?

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 We are designing a network for our new medical center within the region. When designing a hierarchical network, we were having brainstorming discussion with internal engineering team to take a decide on using 3-tier network for Data Center and 2-Tier for Campus (endpoints and end devices)
 The center would occupy 2000+ endpoints in the network. We propose two main core switches, setup as VSS and aggregating approx. 70 access switches installed in different floors in the building communication rooms. Single stack contains 5 or 6 access switches with 10G uplinks to upstream core switches. Access are all L2, and we route between VLANs using SVIs on the core switches and some VLANs are firewalled for Guest and IoT devices.
 Pair of high specs firewalls connected to cores for perimeter (internet, wan &amp; dmz) and internal segmentation (servers &amp; end devices, depending on the use case and security controls requirements.
 Eventually, with regard to servers, we are thinking about having 3-tier network: access &gt; distribution &gt; main campus core
 Two distribution switches with Servers SVIs on them or Firewalls. 
 L2 links terminated on Cores with Point-to-Point transit VLAN. Servers connecting to TOR access switches. 
 Please share your thoughts and comments for 3-tier approach and feel free to add your invaluable inputs if anything is wrong in the design.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve recently discussed if we should keep greylisting enabled on our spam filters.
 I&#x27;ve been researching opinions about greylisting and it seems to have some mixed reactions. Some say it still useful while others say it just causes headaches with email delays and doesn&#x27;t help that much.
 What&#x27;s your take on it?

 No stp will be configure in the core switch and bpdu will be disable using a multicast block that is coming thru the trunk port
 Each access switches will have their own stp domain and bpdu guard enable on all access port except thr uplink trunk port
 Will there be a loop seen in this configuration? We would like to limit the use of stp in our network.
 Any advise or comments will be appreciated

 So long story short... At the CCNA level there is not much BGP required. As long as you know &quot;its the routing protocol of the internet&quot; your about good... Well anyways we have our core and 2 wan edge devices. These wan edge devices have tunnels to each of our some 300+ locations. Each location has a BGP AS number... all in the 65000 private range (at least as far as I understand it). 
 So I guess what I&#x27;m asking is does anyone have a resource I can read and study up on using BGP as a primary internal routing protocol? I have googled iBGP but man... the amount of info out there is nuts. It&#x27;s so much to the point I dont even know where to begin reading...
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I am looking at replacing our access switches in our sites in a year and wanted to look at something not Cisco. 
 I&#x27;ve been team team for over a decade and can afford them but recently, I&#x27;ve seen more and more problems with them. I even had a bug that TAC said &quot;We will wait until someone reports this bug to see if code comes out to fix it&quot; when THEY discovered the bug with me while working on the case. I asked if THEY might be the right team to report said bug and they blew me off. I don&#x27;t need anything crazy -10G uplinks, 48-1G ports, stackable. Right now I&#x27;m running 9200 switches and was looking for recommendations. 
 I&#x27;m leaning toward HP/Aruba but need to dig into which model is closest to these 9200s and want to stay away from anything that handcuffs you with licensing (I.E. charges you to make a 1G port a 10G). Any recommendations? I&#x27;ll end up with about 350 spread out across all of my remote sites so I wanted to buy a few now and plug them in on an upcoming small project to get some time with them. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I am moving from Unifi AP’s to HP Aruba’s. I am planning on rolling them out one at a time, and replacing as I have time.
 Generally speaking we have a business VLAN, and a guest VLAN. If I make the SSID and the passwords the same, and simply replace (since the ports are tagged right on the switches), does it matter? 
 I dont think it would, none of my Unifi stuff is mesh, so it should just jump to wherever its able, right?

                              <span>So I am extremely new to the networking industry. I&#x27;m in my first semester of college (computer technology) and just got a job as a network technician by dumb luck. One of my first tasks is to get an old managed HP 1910 switch up and running to be added to the network. I have a brand new USB to rj45 console cable. I&#x27;m using putty with serial connection enabled. Bits per second 38400. Data bits 8. Stop bits 1. With both parity and flow control set to none. Com 3 is the only serial line that pulls up a terminal. However the terminal is blank and after waiting 10+ mins multiple times and even power cycling during the terminal or before trying to connect, I am unable to get any text to appear on the terminal screen. Am I missing something? I&#x27;m feeling kinda dumb here. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Hi!
 There is Cat6 cabling between my MDF and IDF. It&#x27;s OK for now but an opportunity presented itself to have fiber run between them at almost no extra cost as part of another project. I don&#x27;t have any equipment right now that would be using it so it would be kind of future proofing and would be nice to have an option of 10Gig as I can easily see that being asked for in the future. Now, having never used fiber before I&#x27;m not sure what fiber should be run? I was asked if I want single- or multi-mode. What should I choose? I traditionally stick with Cisco switches, in case this is important and the distance between the locations is at most 200 ft. Are there any other questions that I should ask at this time or when I&#x27;m ready to use that link?

                              <span>I know using them is frowned upon but I am curious. 
 Does MAC address whitelisting (I one this is also not good, but 802.1x is not on the table for a while) configured on firewall still work for devices that connect to unmanaged switch, like desktop connected to netgear 8 port desk switch over Ethernet?
 My company can’t afford wiring new lines right now and we have some machines that can’t use Wi-Fi, they must be plugged in. The topic of unmanaged switches came up. 
 If I can at least whitelist devices on the firewall to allow/deny computers that plug into the unmanaged switch it would be ok for a little bit.
 Would love to hear what everyone thinks about it!

                              <span>I am fairly new to IPV6 (and networking in general).
 Have a PC that needs to talk to a device over IPV6. Hooked the PC to the device using ethernet and attempted to set a static IPv6 address. 
 Device has a static IP of fe80::def set up by manufacturer. Don&#x27;t have an option to change this. Attempted to set static IP on computer to fe80:abc, prefix to 64, and default gateway to fe80::1.
 Whenever I leave the ethernet properties page the static IP reverts to automatic IPV6 address rather than static. Any idea what I am missing?

                              <span>I installed our current “core” switch, a HP 5412zl, exactly 10 years ago. Small network for a SMB ($55m/yr in revenue). 24/7 casino/hotel, so downtime would hurt but ownership understands shit happens.
 Have 12 other ProCurve edge switches connecting to it with 2 or 3 1GbE trunks. It does my VLAN routing. All copper currently, might add fiber in a few years when we expand. Kept it simple. IP cameras are the top bandwidth devices. 
 I updated the firmware 400 days ago, which was the last reboot. I have a spare eBay 5412zl on a shelf for parts. 
 How much risk is involved with running a 10+ core switch? Am I crazy to run this another 5 years before replacing it? Do you see switches fail after 10+ years frequently?

                              <span>Did img backup using macrium of windows 10 ssd 240gb (full) to my external 2tb hdd, how do I boot into a vm from my external hdd since the internal ssd is full? It wouldn&#x27;t let me as the img backup and the initial boot (loading the macrium iso) of the vm can&#x27;t both be from the external hdd apparently? Just want to test and see if the backup works/is stable. Thanks all.
 ​
 EDIT: More info. I set the vm file location to the external hdd and when I tried to enable the physical usb external hdd to connect to the vm to load the disk img backup, an error popped up basically saying I can&#x27;t do those 2 things from an external drive?? It wouldn&#x27;t let me boot and recover the backup since if I enabled the physical external hdd to the vm to access the img backup, it would disable the external hdd to the main pc which is what the vm is running from. 
 Is there a way for the external hdd to work in the vm and with the main pc at the same time?
 ​
 Have I just missed something obvious? I am confused lol. 
 ​
 I must&#x27;ve done something wrong. Most people can&#x27;t just boot up their backup on the internal drive because who has enough space for that? (Essentially 2 copies of a whole computer on the same drive) Mine is only 240gb, how do guys with maxed 3tb drives test their backups? Nobody just assumes their giant backup works?

                              <span>We currently use USB’s to image new computers. I’d like to find a faster method and was wondering if anyone had any guides to do this?
 We have 10+ offices and each has their own localized server, so they’re not all interconnected or anything. Have only been at this company for about a year fresh out of college, I’m currently the only IT on premises with msp backup support. 
 Thanks guys!

                              <span>So during the weekend we tried a « p2v » conversion from an azure VM to vmware 7.0u3 host
 We used the vmware converter latest version and the conversion went fine. Windows booted (2008r2) lol and everything worked, except the SSL certificate. Who was broken
 We even tried to reimported the SSL certificate and it seems that the whole ssl certificate IIS store stemmed broken
 So we tried to download the VHD from azure and convert them to VMDK and import them into vmware and all worked #1
 Is it something that vmware converter couldn’t do or is it something on the azure side?
 I’m kinda lost
 Thanks

                              <span>I work at a university, and most staff that have IT issues seem to think they already know the answer, or just have general &quot;hmm I still think IT is at fault&quot; demeanour when you&#x27;re giving an answer to their problem.
 I generally try to be really civil, but sometimes the answer to an issue is so glaringly obvious, and becomes a real waste of time have to go through all the rigmarole to prove that the problem is a user problem, not a system/network/IT problem, that I feel I need to be a bit more blunt and not worry too much about how I&#x27;m coming across.
 To give you an example, just recently I had person in senior management raise a ticket because an important document couldn&#x27;t be found on SharePoint. The ticket was escalated to me, and after looking into it, it just looks like someone moved the doc into another folder (probably accidentally). The user was trying to access the file from a URL link, and when it didn&#x27;t work (because the file was moved), they panicked and assumed IT had done something. When I told the user that the file was most likely moved, their response is still implying that IT had something to do with it, as no one in their team (over 10 people, all with edit access to the file) would have moved the file. I reiterated that it was probably an accident by someone in the team, and a fairly common and easily addressable mistake, but the user has now involved their manager, to make sure the problem doesn&#x27;t happen again. It&#x27;s now become a way bigger issue than it ever needed to be, all because someone just accidentally moved an important file, and the user just can&#x27;t accept that this happened and it wasn&#x27;t someone IT behind it.
 This is just a recent scenario. Issues like these seem to happen all the time, where frustrated users just don&#x27;t believe what you&#x27;re telling them and seem to just blame anything on either IT staff or systems that they don&#x27;t understand, yet speak with authority on.
 Any advice?

 Still get number out of 9.9 and such, is it to get you to look at critical items more or something else going on?

                              <span>The company I&#x27;m working for has historically bought whatever random computers were needed as people were hired from wherever they could get them. This was ok at first but we&#x27;ve grown and need to start operating more like a real IT department.
 I&#x27;d like to hear what laptop you have and how it differs from what your users have, or if you have multiple tiers.
 The market really is Dell, HP and Lenovo. I&#x27;m not really interested in HP.
 They say IT should have what the users have. We&#x27;re a bit tricky since we have a ton of tech employees and engineers.
 A lot of people are running docker on their laptops but do not need absolutely absurd power but this just means the low end is out.
 I think we can cross off anything extremely low end, but also 9 pound workstation devices.

                              <span>I work in a manufacturing environment. Many things are done “because this is how we’ve always done it”. Change can prove to be difficult, but the toner headaches alone are enough for me to want to prompt change. Right now hundreds of pieces of paper are printed per shift and filled out by hand. One poor lady has to scan all these into a folder then they are just recycled. My thought is a few Windows based domain joined tablets with a shared account. That way all production paperwork can be filled out on the tablet and saved to the network location. 
 I have explained this and am still getting some push back. Any other suggestions?

 Trying to configure a Brother printer via print management. I have reset the printer, disabled firewall and applied all other troubleshooting that I read up here and other places. I can log into the printer web page and ping it as well. The issue has occurred recently after some updates- maybe windows 10?, I can&#x27;t be sure.

                              <span>So... we have our topology and sites well-defined and based on physical location of data centers with DCs in them. What we haven&#x27;t been keeping up with is the subnet definitions. We now have hundreds to add.
 My question is: is it better try try to supernet and add large ranges of IP, and maybe misalign some ranges, or to add all of the smaller ranges and ensure we have the right sites associated with each subnet?
 There is a business case for the smaller subnets, but I&#x27;m not sure if it creates issues with lag on site lookup.

                              <span>This is the fourth job in 7 years I&#x27;m getting laid off due to mergers or outsourcing and it&#x27;s getting tiring. I&#x27;m in my mid-30s, right here when age discrimination starts becoming a real thing, and just want a stable company for the next 15 years. 
 So the good news is the company is giving us 10 months severance plus 1 week&#x27;s pay for every year and 6 months of insurance after we are let go.
 The bad news. When our director called us into the conference call to give the news he was very candid and probably told us more than he should have. Basically, it boils down to money, the business leaders found they can hire in Europe/UK for 60% of US wages. They can hire Indians for 20% of US wages. Australian wages were a wash with the US. They also decided it&#x27;s cheaper to move the HQ to Ireland (with much lower corporate taxes) and import to the US. 
 I work with folks from Ireland and UK every day and their work is every bit as good as what we do in the states. I&#x27;m not bashing their skills but more concerned if we, Americans with insane salaries, have priced ourselves out of the global market. The state I live in has an average income of $61k. I make $153k. I make this kind of money with no degrees, a couple of entry-level certs, and to be honest very little effort on my part. I just kind of have been the guy people get along with and every few years some past co-worker DMs me if I&#x27;m interested in a new job. 
 Add in the sharp rise in remote work capabilities it&#x27;s easier than ever for companies to look abroad for workers. Hell, even Canada and Mexico have much cheaper labor.

 Once I try to demote the old DC, the wizard tells me that it is the last DC in the network, which means it doesn&#x27;t recognize the 2 new DC I&#x27;ve created.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not a trained sysadmin, more of a guy who got roped into doing some IT stuff.
 So I have 15 Surface Go with Windows 10 with S mode. I need to make all of them have Windows 10 Home(via the free switch using Microsoft Store) with the same set of software. I figured the easiest way to do this is to clone a &quot;master&quot; Surface Go and clone them to the other 14 machines using Clonezilla.
 I am wondering if the master Surface Go&#x27;s license key will get cloned to the other machines or if their key is already burnt into bios and I don&#x27;t have to worry about them. Or do I have to find the keys for each machine and &quot;re-key&quot; them after cloning? 
 As of now, I don&#x27;t have a budget to get VLs or Enterprise licensing but if that is the only way to do it properly I&#x27;ll have to do some convincing to my bosses...

                              <span>I have 6 DCs. Some running 2016 and 1 on 2012r2. I need to bring the functional level to 2016 on 2019 servers. I must re use the IPs and i prefer to keep the server names if we can.
 I understand in place upgrade on DC is not recommended. Would it be ok to demote, in place upgrade, promote? (of course, health check, migrate FSMO etc).
 I guess the next best option is deploy new VM, demote the old server and change IP of new server, then promote. But i lose the name and for matters of convenience, i&#x27;d rather not. Could i safely use the first option?

It happened to totally randomly and I have no idea what it&#x27;s talking about. Even if I knew the code that it wants, it won&#x27;t allow me to type anything in the space provided. Underneath this is an option to change languages which I am able to click so the entire screen is not Frozen it&#x27;s just it won&#x27;t let me get the cursor going....
 Is there something I can do like a key I can press upon starting up to bypass this requirement? Please help there is so so much valuable information on this laptop.

                              <span>So its been about a year since I have been with this public community college. 
 One of the things they do here is when an employee retires they get to keep there email address. 
 I personally feel that that&#x27;s not a good thing. I did some PowerShell here and there and basically did this. 
 1) Who are all the retired employees?
 2) When was the last time they have logged in to there exchange 2016 or Online. 
 Nearly all have not logged in within a year or more. 
 ​
 My concerns are that;
 1) They don&#x27;t have MFA enabled. 
 2) They may contain sensitive information in those emails. So if the email becomes compromised that becomes accessible information. 
 3) If the account becomes compromised, they can use that email to communicate to other employees and make it easier to social engineer them. 
 4) A wasted license. 
 I am still new to my role and I may be paranoid for nothing, so from a more experienced individual what are your thoughts on this and if its best to get rid of this plan what are the reasons? 
 I have some directors that agree with me, but my VP of technology doesn&#x27;t (Ironic I think). 
 ​
 But of course if a user isn&#x27;t trying to log into there account would it really get compromised? I don&#x27;t know, but I appreciate every input! Thanks.

                              <span>At one point, I had an OpenLDAP server running in my homelab on a Raspberry Pi as I was trying to learn OpenLDAP setup and configuration. I had it working and could even use it to authenticate 802.1x connection attempts.
 Unfortunately, disaster struck and now I&#x27;m trying to recreate it from scratch and I&#x27;m having a hell of a time trying to get even the most basic stuff working. I&#x27;ve managed to set the &#x27;admin&#x27; password and can query the root DSE from Apache DirectoryStudio using &#x27;cn&#x3D;admin,cn&#x3D;config&#x27;, but that&#x27;s about it. I can&#x27;t change, create, or delete anything.
 I made a post on something similar two years ago, but I was trying to create a RO user for RADIUS to search the LDAP database for user authentication. I just don&#x27;t remember encountering this specific issue before, the last I recalled, I had to create a RO user but it appears I can&#x27;t even do that as the admin user itself is RO.
 What&#x27;s even more frustrating is that all the howtos and docs I&#x27;ve been reading over the last four days all assume that admin can write! My admin account can&#x27;t write anything except its own password apparently.
 How do I get the admin user access to everything (like a proper admin account) so I can get this project off the ground? 
 Thank you for your help!

                              <span>Is anyone aware of a network switch that plugs directly into a power socket? Similar to some power line adapters but just a network switch. I have a weird space constraint in a certain spot and I need to route an ethernet connection to two devices and the cleanest solution would probably be something that plugs in like that. 100 Mbit switch is perfectly acceptable. No need to gigabit.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m designing an EVPN-BGP network. I have never gone into etails wrt BGP.I read Krattiger&#x27;s book about EVPN-BGP a Nexus 9000&#x27;s perspective and there he always mentions that two fashions of eBGP might be used:
  
one AS for the spines, one for all the leaves; here the ption of accepting prefixes from own&#x27;s AS must be cnfigured, otherwise all the announcements will be discarded
 one AS for the spines and one AS for each VTEP; here I only see a bit of complexity in configuring each VTEP because I cannot apply the same settings.
  
eBGP was proposed because, I think, if a peer goes down, then all the family memebers announce by it will be witdrawn in the peer&#x27;s BGP table.
 Then somebody proposed to use
 3) iBGP but with Route Reflectors, because when a VTEP goes down all the family members announced by it will be withdrawn by the BGP tables of of al lthe clients.
 What do you implement in your own EVPN-BGP design and why?Any preferences among the 3 options above?
 TIA, Pan

                              <span>The idea is simple: We need dynamic allocation of an incoming request via https, which will use a domain, e.g subdomain1.domain.org, which needs to be mapped to internal IP X.X.X.X and Port Y. Then, subdomain2.domain.org needs to go on a different port and IP. 
 Nothing special so far.
 ​
 Dynamic meaning on the fly, without having to edit a config file. These mapping need to be editable by another program.
 ​
 The subdomains can be created at will and need to be routed to the correct instance of our program (where each instance runs on a different port).
 There is nothing special needed, just a simple domain -&gt; IP:PORT mapping like HAProxy can do.
 However, HAProxy has its Runtime API, which seems to not be able to hold up to this task.
 ​
 Do I need to create a custom forwarding solution, or are there existing ones which i could use?
 I personally think that HAProxy is really made for this, but it does not feature a way for dyamic creation. Since adding needs to be done ASAP, these edits cannot be done by hand and have to happen automatically.
 ​
 Has anyone here experience regarding automatic proxying? It seems like NGINX has some kind of feature like this, but then i&#x27;d had to pay a few thousands bucks for their NGINX plus model.
 ​
 Please let me know if more clarification is needed.

                              <span>I’ve been tasked with helping build out a core network for our company. We recently merged with several other “local” businesses and are looking to build out a core network between the sites. Our CIO has already indicated his desire that the core will be a DWDM fiber ring but has left the rest to me (with assistance from some of our consultants).
 I’m curious if anyone has any insights that they learned from doing something similar. Anything you wished you incorporated into the design? Any vendor preferences or experience? We are currently looking at Ciena and Adva for DWDM and Cisco and Extreme for Core Routing. And I’d like to have the same vendor supply both core routing and Data Center switches. Corporate Network itself will be Cisco for the foreseeable future.
 Size wise (for context) Site is Core Chassis, 24 IDFs (30 9400 chassis) and ~400 Access Switches. ~65-70000 endpoints according to ISE. The other three sites are about 1/3-1/2 that size

                              <span>I am responsible for a community building in my village where we want to improve the network. The budget is limited of course.
 I want to have an internal LAN, for internal equipment, which can also be accessible through WiFi. I also want to create a public LAN for guests, wireless as well as wired (from selected places). The private lan should not be reachable from the public lan, but the opposite is ok.
 We managed to lay our hands on a Cisco WLC plus 5 APs as well as two Cisco manageable switches, so I believe that the only thing missing here is a router (preferably Cisco). Can anyone please suggest a suitable model? It needs to be able to handle Gigabit Ethernet, otherwise I don’t believe it needs any fancy features 
 I have found a used Cisco ISR 4331 for about $250 which is within my budget. Would this be a good choice?
 Thanks.

                              <span>We recently onboarded a group of test engineers that are constantly running automated tests 24/7 (all conducted on their own VLAN network). Ever since they’ve joined everyone has started complaining about slow internet and we cannot upgrade our main ISP connection since we’re already on the highest (albeit slow in general) service tier. 
 Luckily a new ISP became available and we are about to sign up with them. 
 So I had a question about how to best configure my firewall appliance now that I’ll have two ISPs. 
 What are the pros/cons of these ideas:
  
Load balance WAN1 and WAN2. 
 
Get the testers on a dedicated switch that would connect to a dedicated interface port on the firewall and route that traffic to WAN2. 
 
 Which of these two would be the better option? If there are any better ideas let me know.

                              <span>I have 2 Routers , A and B
 Both are directly connected to each other and are also in OSPF 
 Router A loopback and router ID 1.1.1.1
 Router B loopback and Router ID 1.1.1.2
 Router A and Router B direct link 192.1681.1. and 192.168.1.2 respectively
 QUESTIONS
  
When I ping Router B from A without sourcing, what is the source address of the ping? default source address 
  
2.When I ping Router B from A sourcing from 192.168.1.1 (interface Ip) , is the loopback of Router A involved somehow in the ping ?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello wizards of /r/networking,
 I am looking for a sanity check and guidance on how to proceed. I started at a new firm almost a year ago and the environment feels like I went back in time twenty years. There are three members of the team: the senior guy, my boss and me. Basically the situation is: I am trying to propose modern ways to design the network and the senior guy isn&#x27;t having any of it. Here&#x27;s an example:
 In the current topology, the senior guy has configured one firewall interface per VLAN. When they ran out of interfaces on the firewall, the previous person in my position configured an 802.1q trunk for three VLANs, to which the senior guy objected to, but it was done anyway because obviously, there weren&#x27;t any firewall interfaces left. The senior guy was also adamant about ke…</span>

                              <span>I’m looking for some career advice in regard to moving into a network automation role. I am a network engineer with just over 10 years of experience. I am the one on my team tasked with automating. However, automation isn’t my primary job. I have an associates degree and some Cisco certs (including DEVNETASC). I’ve created web apps, automated network configuration, and created scheduled scripts to automate repeatable tasks. I have seen job postings for “Network Development Engineer” roles at large companies like Amazon and was wondering if anyone here is in a similar role and can give me advice on what hiring managers are looking for. Do I need a computer science degree? I actually just started a journey to get a CS degree, but man is it time consuming(especially with a family), expensive, and a lot of math (four more math classes). Or would my time be better spent getting DEVNET Professional and maybe some cloud certs?

                              <span>So the question I have relates to Cisco Jabber. The User (or Users) can make calls from Jabber going from Jabber on his laptop to External company numbers. However they are not able to contact Internal company numbers.
 Naturally someone said it sounds like a routing issue. (Most of the company has Jabber working this is a new group being stood up working from vpns)
 User(who is on a vpn) can ping all the way into the Datacenter to the call manager server, I can ping from the switch the server is connected to, to the User PC. I can ping both directions from the Data Center Backbone switch. Routing seems to work. 
 ​
 So here&#x27;s my thoughts. If they are able to talk to external numbers then the traffic has to go all the way into the datacenter anyways and hit the server before going back out again. Also from what I saw in emails of previous troubleshooting the Jabber Client on the PC is saying connected as far as registering with the server goes.
 (also for your knowledge I&#x27;m mainly from networking side of the house, we have a separate dept for the phone stuff so typically don&#x27;t get too much into phone issues most of the time.)
 ​
 Jabber Outgoing - &gt; External Number - Works
 Jabber Incoming Internal Number - Not Work
 Jabber Incoming -&gt; Internal Number - Not Work
 ​
 Any thoughts of what more to look into or questions I should ask?

                              <span>Hey y’all we are spooling up a public wifi for use by our students and they are going to need access to a few services inside of the “faculty/staff” network. 
 The thing is that the students are using O365 for their email and authentication but it does not appear that they have an Azure DC service. Faculty is using a hybrid prem/azure deployment with Clear pass access rules to provide services to the Faculty wireless network. 
 I am familiar with opening services up on a Meraki Wireless and clearpass is a new animal for me. If someone can point me to a doc or tutorial on opening up a domain/server to these guys i would appreciate it. My googlefu is weak.

 I looked in the OCG ENCOR book and it doesn&#x27;t mention anything about how NAT would work in an environment like this. I imagine there&#x27;s some way that 2 routers could share NAT translations but my Google skills are failing me. 
 What&#x27;s considered best practice in a network like this?

 I tried cloudflare but my director has a dislike for their services as we need like 38 cname and MX entries.
 So my question is this who else offer an affordable DNS Hosting that can support the number of records we are pointing to our various services and sub domains.

 Right Switch: Vlan 30 computer, Vlan 20 computer, Vlan 20 computer, Router configured with subinterfaces for each Vlan (10,20,30), when &quot;show ip route&quot; shows everything allright
 So my problem is that I have configured everything exactly the same for each Vlan to make Router-On-A-Stick possible and it works, for example I can ping Vlan 30 computer to Vlan 20 computer or the opposite case but no computer on any Vlan can ping Vlan 10 and Vlan 10 can&#x27;t ping the other Vlans. So what could be the problem? I swear to God I configured every Vlan in the same way and I have deleted the lab and started again several times and happens the same issue. Thanks in advance

                              <span>Why are there different types of them when they are basically just doing the same thing, just sending data? I understand perhaps there&#x27;s something different with the formatting of different data such as files or videos but on a digital level they&#x27;re just a bunch of ones and zeros so why bother making different types?
 ​
 Also, I&#x27;ve tried cutting an ethernet cable in half and I can&#x27;t seem to find any additional circuitry. All I saw was just a bunch of wires together. So what makes this ethernet cable different from a USB cable? Is there a circuit inside that I didn&#x27;t see that processes or sends data differently?
 ​
 Also read that HDMI is better designed for sending media such as video, but why so? why is it better than a USB? Does it have some additional circuitry? If yes, what does it do?

 I&#x27;m currently leveraging the crap out of this because it simplifies the firewall policies considerably. But I&#x27;m curious if PA has something similar (or better?). What other vendors provide this functionality?
 I read, a few minutes ago, that there is now an AWS native PA firewall? 
 Anyway, thanks everyone!

                              <span>Hey everyone. Just looking for some advice. I work in a public hospital system with 8500+ employees. Myself and one other person are responsible for Mobile Technology in all forms: Vocera, Encrypted Flash drives/Ironkey, iPads/iPhones and MDM (Intune), the corporate cellular account, and BYOD support. 
 We&#x27;ve basically been slammed since COVID happened. We work 50 hours a week, then get paged off hours because we didn&#x27;t get to that one ticket that is now suddenly &quot;patient impacting&quot;. Despite working without a lunch break, being in many meetings for projects (6-10hrs a week), and working my ticket queue when possible, we never catch up. For the past two years, we&#x27;ve never been under 100 requests, and we&#x27;ve been building two new sites that have many different mobile applications in which I&#x27;ll somehow be supporting. As of current, my team of two support over 17k devices including 5k personal devices in BYOD. 
 I know nowhere is perfect, but I feel my boss is being arrogant when I ask him about hiring more people. His response is always &quot;this is only a phase&quot; or &quot;we&#x27;re fully staffed at what we have, we&#x27;ll have to get caught up&quot;. But other internal IT depts are hiring like crazy. The apps team hired 5 in the last two years and the epic team brought in a whole company of 20 contractors to do their breakfix while they worked on our new sites. Just as examples
 I guess what I&#x27;m asking is is this situation everywhere? Am I dreaming that IT life doesn&#x27;t have to be so understaffed and overworked? I&#x27;m salary and don&#x27;t break 75k, and my coworker is at 55k. We get great healthcare, which is why I stay, but just wondering if you all think I should man up and realize I work in a stressful environment and IT is that way everywhere, or is there better out there somewhere? What&#x27;s it like for you all in similar roles? Thanks for your thoughts!

                              <span>I had heard about the MS internal Azure blob that was not secured properly. I finally looked at the search that SOCRadar put up. 
 https://socradar.io/labs/bluebleed
 They do not return results, just whether the domain shows in the leak. My company’s does. 
 I’ve heard nothing from MS. I also suspect there is nothing sensitive I’ve given MS.
 I’m curious if anyone has been informed by MS that they were affected. 
 MS’ statement says, in part, “ Our investigation found no indication customer accounts or systems were compromised. We have directly notified the affected customers.”
 I’m also curious how they define “affected customers.”

                              <span>Fellow Sysadmins, 
 I am hoping that the collective minds here on Reddit can help me out. 
 I am the administrator of an air gapped network inside of our Enterprise-Wide Network 
 In order to access it the users must be on the EWN. 
 The network has its own domain which does not trust the EWN. 
 There is no smtp traffic allowed out. 
 The only way the end users can get it is to have an account on in my domain, as well as on the Enterprise domain. They can access 1 server over RDP.
 Now my problem is this, the accounts are set to expire every 30 days for security purposes. BUT there is no way the user can log in via RDP if their account is expired, to reset the account. 
 I am looking for a method for the users can manage their own accounts, so they don’t have to call me to reset their passwords. Are any of you in the same situation, and how do you resolve it?

                              <span>Greetings fellow IT professionals. I need your help and advise regarding PSU configuration issues in a Dell Poweredge r6515. It is running RHEL 8. I hope I can explain this clearly…
 We recently upgraded PSU’s in the server from 550w to 700w. According to the Dell website, the new PSU you install will take on the firmware of the previously installed PSU. So, in this case our 700w PSU is using the firmware of the 550w PSU. Obviously we just need to install the firmware for the 700w PSU’s. Here’s the catch, Dell doesn’t have any firmware for 700w PSU’s for this server available to download. There should be firmware available for download because you can buy the r6515 server from Dell with the 700w PSU’s installed. 
 When we boot up the server it enters the bios and gives a low power warning. 
 IDRAC says the input wattage is 666 and output wattage - rated: 700, actual: 550. 
 We have been talking back and forth with Dell tech support and their tier 1 support has no clue what’s going on. They sent technicians out this week to install a new power board but that didn’t do anything to help. The technicians got one of the Dell tier 2 support guys in the phone but he didn’t help much either. 
 Anyone have any ideas or have any experience with this situation?

                              <span>There is official documentation and there is personal one. There are documents referenced daily, and those prepared for handovers. It can often be blurry, depending on organization and its scale. What do you like? What do you work with? What would you like to see in a new job?
 First, the style:
 The best documentation I have ever read, was like reading an engaging story of growth, challenges and solutions. I felt like I have learned so much after finishing it.
 But it was a story of one custom application, not some giant system. Can it scale? Would it still be useful for later use if it was a large document?
 Some people know what will be useful, but not always you will catch everything.
 But are SOPs and RACIs the answer? 
 Second, the organization:

                              <span>Suppose that I spend 3 days setting up a server: installing new software, setting up user accounts and credentials, generating config files for SSH, Samba, firewall, etc. Now I want to store these instructions in a config file, so that on a new installation I press a button and the desired server is generated; importantly, all those config files become effective! 
 Basically, something like a jason file that creates a desired server according to my specification quickly, without manually installing pieces, copy pasting configs, setting up user accounts, etc. I then simply keep track of this config file. 
 What software does that? Should I learn ansible? 
 This is just for personal use, not enterprise.

                              <span>I have a pair of Brocade 6505 16GB switches, looking to upgrade to 32GB. My use case is simple, inter-connect 5-node VMware cluster to a backend Pure storage system; multi-path across.
 These were purchased back before Brocade was acquired by Broadcom. I reached out to my Dell rep and apparently Dell now has their own Connectrix FC switches. I think these are still Brocades under the Dell badge.
 Anyone have any experience with them?

 The device I tested on has a TPM and I see no issuing errors on the server side So, it should be stored in the TPM. 
 I see no reference to the certificate in the user certificate MMC.
 Where can you view and verify that the certificate is being stored in the device Tpm?

 Then they installed a new production line using Siemens&#x27; products. Which none of the engineers or technicians had any training for. It&#x27;s the equivalent of a datacenter dumping IBM&#x27;s z/OS mainframe systems onto a staff that only has experience with Windows/Linux, and telling them to figure it out.
 &quot;It&#x27;s fine, the vendor said they&#x27;ll program the production line for us.&quot;
 On the day that the production line was suppose to start, we quickly discovered there were de-synchronization between the stations that made up each stage of the production line. Such as one station being unable to properly tell an upstream station to send parts down the conv…</span>

new place (4-5 admins) and totally new mgmt
 lots of attrition and those that managed IT ( ran the shop from day to day) and knew how things work around here left.
 there is a leaver every 2 weeks( infra/apps/IT mgmt/business)
 average tenure is 3-6 mths 
 some cowboys ( 1-2 senior admins with medium to high skill / age in IT but only worked at the place for 12 mths maybe 24) who play guessing games and have to discover the env as they go ( no up to date /accurate documentation ) fix stuff which break without telling the rest exactly how and also don’t document or share their knowledge 
 stuff keeps breaking - cowboys on leave or not available leaving juniors or newbies 
 Majority of Apps team and senior mgmt is very new too and clueless and just trying to outsource to solve the issues
 lots of politics /pushback between teams ( especially apps/infra/security )and finger pointing 
 only good thing is deep/wide /complex tech stack and playground as admins have full access to a whole stack.
  
Any comments / strategies for noob in a minefield?

                              <span>Recently acquired a decommissioned Poweredge T420 that appears to be in okay condition, other than a missing RAID controller. 
 However, I&#x27;m also having issues at boot with iDRAC. Very similar to this post https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/cw7esz/idrac_initialization_error_on_poweredge_t420/ where fans are blowing at max speeds, the light at the back of the machine is flashing orange with the following error message:
  
Warning! iDRAC initialization error. Continuing to boot may yield unexpected power loss due to unknown power inventory and various features lost such as Remote Access, Active Power Management, Thermal Management, Inventory, LCD, or System Error Reporting. 
  
I guess my question is, do I have two separate issues going on here? Or is the iDRAC issue related to the missing raid controller. Just wondering if I purchase a replacement RAID controller am I going to still be stuck with more problems. This is my first Dell Server and have no experience with how iDRAC works.

 I am good with powershell and found now some time. I want to do a deep dive ito packaging with psappdeloyment toolkit, since this seems becoming more important. 
 Can somebody guide me/recommend any good resources to get started? 
 Aiming for psapp packaging for intune to deploy to clients and virtual desktop infrastructure.

                              <span>Question for my fellow Windows Server Admins. I&#x27;ve got a client that has a Windows Server 2016. It&#x27;s running as a DC, a file server, and there&#x27;s an Access database that clients access through some program installed on the workstations. There&#x27;re two client workstations that can&#x27;t have the program installed and so have to access the database directly on the server. Their previous IT set up RDS but never installed licenses; they just kept renewing the trial. We&#x27;ve had to fix a lot of how the previous IT did things and we are trying to get licensing for the two workstations that need to RDP into the server to access the database. I believe you can have the RDS session host and the RDS licensing manager on the same box, but correct me if I&#x27;m wrong. Can I use 2022 Server CALs for this situation or do I have to use Server 2016 CALs?

                              <span>Hello fellow sysadmins,
 I&#x27;m looking for recommendations of and experiences with Linux antivirus options for on-premise company servers. We already use Symantec on our Windows servers and clients, and while it has a Linux version, it lags behind in supporting recent Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu 22.04) and it doesn&#x27;t play nice with containers. We have a bunch of Ubuntu servers at various locations running QEMU/KVM virtualization, Docker (in VM), Kubernetes (nodes in VMs) und LXD containers (on bare metal) backed by local ZFS storage.
 We&#x27;re looking for an option that is capable of dealing with containers, so that we&#x27;d only need to install the AV on hosts and VMs, and that offers sensible licensing/pricing, ideally per physical server instead of full price per install or at least reduced price for a VM install. Centralized management would be nice but not a requirement, log and/or mail based alerts would suffice. Needless to say we require good detection rates, timely signature updates and the capability to prevent the execution of malware. The main threat scenarios are malware getting on the servers either via compromised clients, exposed vulnerable services (hello Atlassian) or supply chain compromise (hello npm).
 The state of AV websites is a sad affair, with a general lack of clear statements about capabilities and business licensing options and costs (its all &quot;Contact us!&quot;), thus I turn to you.

                              <span>So, I am finishing my course for becoming a sysadmin and I feel like I am varely scrapping the surface of what a sysadmin needs to know. 
 We&#x27;ve just learn a little bit of networking, some AD and LDAP management, server installation and configuration (DHCP, DNS, SMTP,...), some security (iptables, network traffic analysis) amongst other subjects that I feel have little to do with beeing a sysadmin.
 What would be the skills I should focus on learning first? What are the musts? What do you do more often in your job while beeing a sysadmin?
 Thanks in advance for your replies.

                              <span>Hi r/sysadmin, my company is currently expanding its offices to the point where IT will have its own dedicated area. Because of this, we do get a chance to pick if we want anything added to our office space.
 At the moment we’ve through of a workbench area for testing, 1/2 screens for network monitoring, our own fridge and coffee station, and thats it! I wanted to see if you all had any ideas that would be useful. Were a small department so were not building for 100, more so for 5-8.
 Thanks!

 Honesty appreciated, I have never performed upgrades on this scale, I&#x27;m spooked for very un-festive reasons.

                              <span>Currently anxious about a counteroffer I made today. So the job offered me $25 an hr which is $52K. I had the interview this past Monday-nailed my interview including the interview with the V.P. However, I made it clear that I had other interviews that week and could not formally respond until Friday. Another job offered me $28 or $56,160 a year. I called back Job A, recruiter was kind and asked me how my other interviews went. I said great and thanked him for being patient, I said another job offered $28 and wanted to see if they could match it. I stressed that I really wanted to work with them. He asked if I’d take anything lower so I said $27. This is about a $4K difference than their original offer. Normally I wouldn’t negotiate but I feel I’m the perfect person for the role-they actually sought me out from a job site-hounded me for about two weeks for an interview. They ended up offering me the role hours after my interview. My question is, did I screw up? If they reject my counteroffer, can I go back to their original offer? I didn’t make the counteroffer as a non-negotiable, I figured it wouldn’t hurt to ask. He said the latest I should be hearing back is early next week. I wouldn’t start this job until Nov 7, after my two weeks notice with my current company so the delayed acceptance is not an issue.

                              <span>things happened. I’ll be honest, I’m not sure I remember everything. But when I woke up a server with 384 GB (16GB x 24 DDR4 2133MHz) was in my rack. 
 I have no idea what to do with so much RAM. Like, I was running a bunch of VMs and all kinds of craziness and I was hitting 10% utilization at its peak. 
 There must be something cool I can run on this server that would need this much. Any ideas?

                              <span>Man, I just have to get this out there to see if anyone else has dealt with this.
 I work for a health org, so we have about 1200 or so Windows Servers (99% virtualized, on-prem). We monitor just about everything through vROPs when it comes to CPU/RAM/Disk/IOPS etc; but most important of all, Windows Services. All related tickets go to our 24/7 NOC
 We are currently on a vROPs version that is... well past N-1, so we were directed to switch. We chose vROPs cloud.
 When I first heard of the riddance of End Point Operations Management Agent (EPOPS) with vROPs cloud, I felt relief. That agent was truly a POS for some reason in our environment and a pain to deal with if it broke... Anyways... What I didn&#x27;t know though is VMWare changed the way Windows Services were discovered entirely.

                              <span>Strangest issue i have run into in a long long time.
 Network: Comcast static IP on business cable modem not resolving MX record for verizon.net
 I am trying to resolve an MX record for verizon.net and it&#x27;s failing with no records found.
 C:\Windows\system32&gt;nslookup
 Default Server: HAL.xxx.local
 Address: x.x.x.x
 &gt; set type&#x3D;mx
 &gt; verizon.net
 Server: HAL.xxx.local
 Address: x.x.x.x
 *** No mail exchange (MX) records available for verizon.net
 I have determined that this is happening on multiple cable based business comcast networks all with static IPs.
 If anyone can check and report back also? If so, no idea how or to whom to report this?It&#x27;s fine on a Verizon static FIOS network and on a Comcast fiber network, and on a home Comcast cable network just not on a static cable based business Comcast network...
 And i also tried changing DNS servers within nslookup with the same result... so something is blocking MX resolution for verizon.net but just on Comcast business cable connections!?!
 If anyone else is experiencing this as a workaround i setup a send connector scoped for that one domain using smarthost:

                              <span>For the second time in as many weeks, I spent way too much off time working on non-issues that were escalated by our CIO. The first was a tech issue that would have had an embarrassing impact on a high profile quarterly event. It was identified a week prior by the executive support team, but not reported to anyone until 16 hours before the event started. This caused everyone to scramble and brainstorm a solution. After an hour, I proposed a solid workaround that would absolutely work to get us through the event which would buy us more time to work on a permanent solution.

 Our executive was furious, because he wanted a *permanent* solution *right away*, despite my protests that it would take days to really understand it, test it, validate it, document it, implement it, then test it aga…</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 We use Symantec Email.Security Cloud. Yes, I know, Broadcom stuff. Don&#x27;t ask about it.
 This week, Microsoft 365 just disabled Basic Auth from our tenant.
 So, if you are using Schemus (their sync tool) and syncing from Exchange Online (EXO), app passwords won&#x27;t work anymore. 
 Worked with Broadcom&#x27;s support. Surprinsingly, so far so good. 
 Support adviced to:
 - upgrade Schemus to latest downloadable version ( Schemus Synchronization Tool – Mandatory Upgrade (broadcom.com) ) and apply a support-supplied patch. This will enable Microsoft Graph as a source and enables usage of Exchange Online Cert-based auth.
 - Install Powershell 7.03+ plus EXO v3. If using Server 2012 R2 (like me...don&#x27;t ask again) you need to create a config file so Schemus knows where to look for PoSh 7.
 - Configure an App Registration in Azure AD to allow to authenticate against EXO with a certificate (CBA, App-only authentication in Exchange Online PowerShell and Security &amp; Compliance PowerShell | Microsoft Learn )
 - Reconfigure Schemus to use EXO CBA. 
 - And that&#x27;s it...supposedly.
 Why supposedly? Well, seems like Schemus still uses EXO v1 &quot;get-recipient&quot; and that causes a timeout for us for just the &quot;user&quot; sync part (which is optional, but we use it). I managed to reproduce that error and compared against &quot;get-EXOrecipient&quot;, which worked fine. Already told them that, so I guess we will have to wait for another patch from Broadcom&#x27;s developer, Metanate (the one who develops Schemus).
 Hopefully this will help others who are stuck with Broadcom&#x27;s stuff.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for some suggestions on what hardware to purchase for a firewall and switch. We are a small company and the budget is limited. We would prefer (though this is not essential) a single box and something that does not require subscriptions. One of the key requirements is that the stack has no single point of failure as we need to meet high uptime guarantees and so I am looking for something with a redundant power supply (I suppose 2 cheaper switches might be ok). We also need to be able to access the device management interfaces (iDRAC, IPMI) of devices on the internal network remotely and so need to have some facility to create a VPN (this seems preferable to a jump host). So, the requirements are: 1) Redundant power supply 2) Firewall 3) VPN 4) 10GbE minimum (SPF+ is preferred to RJ45) 5) &lt;10 ports required
 Our main issue is that everything available that has redundant PSUs has 40+ ports and costs $$$. We only really need a single WAN port and 5 LAN ports (make that 10 to allow for expansion). Techbuyer have a useful product filter here: https://www.techbuyer.com/uk/catalog/category/view/s/network-switch-selector/id/482/ but all the results are switches with 40+ ports. Does anyone know of other product databases one can use or have any personal suggestions (including a different design utilising multiple boxes)? Any help much appreciated.

                              <span>We currently have 4 sites and all are connected to our main office through IPsec tunnels with ASA. Problem is ASAs are a pain in the ass when it comes to just about anything, so we are slowly moving towards FortiGates. But also if our HQ goes down we lose all communication to the other sites (internally).
 So in the meantime, I&#x27;m looking for the simplest way to get a Mesh VPN network with the ASAs. Is this feasible? I can&#x27;t find much on the topic. Or do I just wait and implement when we get new gear?

                              <span>Looking for recommendations for non-Cisco PoE access switches that can hold up to below freezing, or even subzero F temperatures. Don&#x27;t need to be outdoor rated per se, will be indoors, just not a climate controller indoors, so harsh temperature/humidity exposure.
  
L2 only is fine
 at least 5 10/100/1000 PoE or PoE+ ports
 at least 2 SFP+ (might be able to compromise with SFP)
 AC powered preferred (no need for dual/redundant power)
  
Looking at the usual suspects, Mikrotik CSS610-8G-2S+IN looks like it might be a price winner, but only lists ambient temperatures and not operating temperatures? None of the Mikrotik outdoor-rated switches seem to check all the boxes. Aruba&#x27;s rugged CX 4100i seems perfect on paper, anyone have experience they can share with those?
 Would also be open to older generation, used/refurbished units if it means I don&#x27;t have to wait for any huge supply chain backlogs

                              <span>I oversee a few campus networks where each campus currently has 1 subnet/network for voice and data that spans multiple buildings.
 I&#x27;d like to create a VLAN (200) specifically for the phones but use a unique subnet per building. This will allow us to tell the phone system if network &#x3D; 1.0.1.0/24 use e911 number 555-555-0001.
 Building A (with the firewall) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.1.0/24
 Building B (uplinks to Building A) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.2.0/24
 Building C (uplinks to either Building A or B) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.3.0/24 
 Currently all Buildings have a &#x27;data&#x27; VLAN (1) using the subnet 1.0.0.0/24 
 IIRC, this can be done via VLAN Mapping or Translation? Not something i&#x27;ve every used. Unfortunately, our HPE OfficeConnect (1820/1920 mostly) switches don&#x27;t seem to support this. (I hate these switches) 
 My first thought was to create a VLAN on the firewall per building with a DHCP scope/relay and somehow convert that VLAN to the same phone vlan on the switch. However, I realized this isn&#x27;t easily doable - I could connect two untagged ports together to accomplish this but, ew. 
 My next thought would be to utilize the switches to handle VLAN 200 and set up a DHCP relay (our switches won&#x27;t act as DHCP servers (nor do i think i want to manage that..) I believe all of our switches are Layer 3 lite - allowing for routing. This would work but i&#x27;d have to let the voice traffic traverse the data network and add in routes on the firewall to point to each network switch.. it sounds messy. 
 Is there a solution that I&#x27;m not seeing to accomplish this? (Besides buying new switches lol)

 I&#x27;ve got two 5G connections which are 1000/100Mbps rated.
 ERX seems to peak at about 800-850Mbps with HW offloading enabled.
 was wondering if port aggregation coupled with load ballancing the two connections could make more use of the available WAN bandwidth?

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 I am going to be doing some wireless surveys pretty soon, and was looking to see if anyone had suggestions on building an AP on a stick cart? I have an AP, I have one of those standard two shelf utility carts, UPS, and a small PoE switch for power conversion. What I don&#x27;t know is how I can get the height that I need to lift a pole up and down? My ceilings are going to be 10ft for the most part, so I don&#x27;t think building something with static height will work very well.
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>We&#x27;re looking at using sr-iov to improve our VoIP application within kubernetes on bare metal. I&#x27;ve got a pod using multus to move the sr-iov VF into the interface and this works fine, but am I done?
 Does the fact that I have the VF in the function now mean that I am bypassing the host os networking stack and could theoretically achieve line performance or is there more I need to do? 
 I&#x27;ve done lots of research but I&#x27;m still pretty confused how this actually works. My current understanding is the network driver mounted into the kernel does the magic that means the standard network stack is avoided allowing the performance improvements, is this right?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m new to this group, I hope someone is able to help. 
 We have several Rukus Zoneflex R310 access points in our network, which was originally set up by a third party. I need to change the IP address for our access points which are currently on a 172.16 range. They need to be changed to a 192.168 range. However, whenever I enter the correct IP address to access the browser login page for the AP, I get a 503 service unavailable error. The IP address is definately correct and I have tried accessing it both wirelessly and through a physical connection via our LAN switch. Either way I&#x27;m getting the same 503 error and therefore can&#x27;t make the necessary changes. 
 Any ideas? 
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>I am trying to run a script to check complaince with switches. I got it working for the most part, but ran into a roadblock.
 My task I am trying to do now is to check is a specific ACL exists, and then to also verify it is placed on one of the vty lines. Normally, I would start by doing something like this....
 Output &#x3D; net_connect.send_command (&#x27;show ip access-list&#x27;) if &quot;ACL NAME&quot; in Output: print (&#x27;Compliant&#x27;) else: print (&#x27;Not Compliant&#x27;) 
 That works, but I also want to verify that it is place in the right location. So I could do another function like above to run a &quot;show run | sec line vty&quot; and verify that &quot;ACL NAME&quot; is in the Output. But that would be 2 different functions and 2 different print statements.
 Is there a way I can run both of those checks and have one print statement if they are both compliant?
 I was thinking I could do something like this....
 def check_acl(Output) if &quot;ACL NAME&quot; in Output: return True return False Output &#x3D; net_connect.send_command (&#x27;show ip access-list&#x27;) if check_acl(Output): print (&#x27;Compliant&#x27;) else: print (&#x27;Not Compliant&#x27;) 
 I was thinking I could do 2 def statements then have the function check for both def statements, but I am getting lost with that.
 Does anyone have any suggestions?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi,
 I am trying to start a new project where I need some devices which will be configured with OSPF and stacking or MLAG. So far I had setups with Cisco 6500 (no stacking here but dual supervisors), 2x Brocade ICX 6610 in stacking, 2x Dell 6224 in stacking. What I can say is that cisco and brocade were both extremely stable while dell had CPU usage issues along side other minor issues. Obviously all options I used so far are very old and I would like to try something new which consume less power.
 I was looking at Arista DCS-7050TX or Dell S4048-ON (I know there is a risk of Clock Signal failure, or was there?). Any suggestions or maybe different options? And yes I am sure these options are a bit older too but for this personal project I would go with something refurbished. Thank you :)

                              <span>Long time IT admin but only just getting into setting fiber networks. I&#x27;ve got a number of Dell hosts PE640 with QLogic 4x10GE QL41164HMCU. I can use either Dell DAC cables or SFPs to connect these to a Dell S5048F-ON but regardless of which I use none of the ports light up. 
 I&#x27;ve tried setting the &#x27;no shutdown&#x27; command on the interface but it doesn&#x27;t seem to make any difference. If I connect the cables from host to host the NICs light up fine. 
 Is there something really basic I&#x27;m missing?

                              <span>Hello,
 I’m posting here because i’m a bit lost and I don’t know what to do with my career. I’m a network engineer currently working in the banking industry. Currently I work a lot on campus networking and especially Wifi (Cisco and Aruba) and NAC stuff (mostly ISE), but I’m one of the few in the team which is able to work on almost every perimeter (LAN, WIFI, Automation, Routing, Security).
 Right now I don’t really know what would be best for my career, I could dig more in WIFI for exemple and become a specialist in one of those field or keep being a « jack of all trade master of none ». But i’m always afraid by choosing to become a specialist on a field, WiFi, i’m closing myself some doors and be less futur proof in my career.
 So I’m interested from your experience what do you think would be best to do ?
 Thanks a lot

                              <span>My understanding is that a 20m cat 6 cable should be fine, but it is causing intermittent problems in linux. Oddly it works fine with windows.
 If I replace it with a short cable it works fine, so it is definitely the cable.
 Not sure if it&#x27;s a dodgy cable or if I am getting lots of electromagnetic interference.
 Should I buy a shielded cable? or perhaps a cat 7. or is there some way to make linux run on a more unstable connecton since windows seems fine with it.

                              <span>Never ran across this before in 15 years... 
 Existing gear in IDF1 was a Cisco 2960x with 1gig link back to MDF (Meraki ms425).
 Upgraded IDF1 to Meraki ms225 and new 10gig MMF SFP last night. Had issues trying to get the fiber link up. Tried rolling fiber at IDF. Tried rolling fiber at MDF. Tried different patch cable at IDF side. Now what worked was rolling at BOTH sides. Once that link came up (and at 10gig), I was like - that doesn&#x27;t make sense so we tested and rolled them both back and tried all other combinations, fail.
 Fast forward to tonight. Same site, different IDF, same MDF switch. Link wouldn&#x27;t come up after new gear was in. I said let&#x27;s roll both sides at the same time. Link came up. What the hell?
 The only thing I can think of is - at the MDF side, fiber patch cables are orange, but there&#x27;s about a foot of distance leading starting at its LC connector where ONE of the strands turns yellow. Where it transitions orange, there&#x27;s about 2 inches of some sort of shrink wrap and the cable gets slightly bulkier there. The other strand is orange the whole way. It looks factory made. I haven&#x27;t been able to find an image of those online. 
 Who know what&#x27;s going on here?

 Problem 8(using link): I know that the window size is how many frames it can transfer at a time. 
 In this scenario, the first 3 frames are sent, and B would have to send an acknowledgement that it received frame 1. The last bit of the first frame arrives at B in 20 msec and therefore, 30 msec after the frame transmission begins. 
 How I interpret it:
  
Frame 1 takes 10 msec to arrive from A to B
 I don&#x27;t understand &quot;The last bit of the first frame arrives at B in 20 msec, and therefore, 30 msec&quot; Are we still talking about frame 1? 
  
​
 This is the diagram i&#x27;ve written to help me understand it:
  
I have 10 frames(10 boxes)
 A sender with vert line, and B is receiver with vert line: frames 1,2,3 are sent.
 Frame 1 takes 10 msec to transmit from A to B
 Frame 2 takes 10 msec after frame A is transmitted to transmit from A to B
 Frame 3 takes 10 msec after frame B is transmitted to transmit from A to B
 3 frames fill up the window, so receiver has to send out an acknowledgement that it received frame 1. Window slides, and A is able to send another frame to B, then B sends acknowledgement again and it repeats. 
  
The bullet point I bolded is what I am struggling with. My teacher has tried explaining this to me, but I&#x27;m not grasping that way of interpreting it.

                              <span>We&#x27;re a mixed Mac/Windows shop in a company that is finally taking IT seriously after just handing out laptops to users with no management for years. The Mac side of things is covered with MDM now as that was the first priority because it&#x27;s a larger user base. We&#x27;re looking at Intune because zero-touch provisioning is a huge priority for us so we&#x27;d like to get our hands on Autopilot.
 The catch is, from my understanding Autopilot requires Azure Premium licenses, but we would only need that feature for the minority of users we have on Windows. There are plenty of Mac users who do want/need Office 365 licenses and we&#x27;d like to keep things all integrated, with our Okta deployment automatically provisioning/de-provisioning users in Azure. But we want to make sure we only pay for licenses each …</span>

 Right now I can&#x27;t see the health of our servers without logging into them and reading our daily email from AJTech, and I&#x27;m way too lazy to do that every day. How are people monitoring that their WSUS servers are properly downloading patches? I&#x27;d like to get this into zabbix and grafana but I&#x27;m not really sure where to start on this.

                              <span>The company i&#x27;m working for (in Europe) isn&#x27;t doing good financially right now. I already saw some colleagues leaving because their contracts didn&#x27;t get extended and now also our budget is downsized to 1/7 of the intentional budget.
 I spoke with my manager and the other tech about all the things happening right now and they both told me in confidence they are already applying for another job. Also the people on our IT helpdesk are already fired.
 The fun fact is that I&#x27;m also busy finding another job and the three of us (manager, other tech and me) are the last sys admins for the company. So we are probably all going to leave the company in a couple of weeks without a replacement and I want to leave as much information behind for my successor(s).
 Besides of documentation, what can I do to make it as easy as possible for the people that will replace us?

                              <span>We are working for multiple customers. Mostly we administrate some servers or databases for those (so we run Ansible, we connect to databases, replace certificates and such tasks). Every customer is sharing us a VPN – mostly personal accounts with 2FA, not a site-to-site or a general VPN account. This means that every new colleague is getting a new VPN account. Some VPNs require additional configurations (f.ex. setting routes/DNS manually), some not. And we have plenty of technologies: OpenVPN, L2TP/IPSec, FortiClient VPN, Cisco, …
 As some are using Linux, some Windows, some macOS – there are always troubles setting the VPN&#x27;s up.
 We first started using OpenConnect, which supports a lot of different VPN services. But we had the problem that some configurations did not apply correctly and that some IDS systems detected this and it was forbidden by the IT.
 So: I&#x27;m looking for a way how my co-workers easily can connect to the different VPN&#x27;s. I&#x27;m currently thinking of creating an RDS Server for each customer with everything preconfigured, authenticated by a certificate – or maybe something with Amazon WorkSpaces. But I think there must be a better solution to this.
 How do you handle this? Do you have an idea how we could gain some efficiency instead of a long on-boarding process and big documentations? It can be a technical solution, as we&#x27;re mostly developers, system engineers or similar.
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Currently our company has a weekly rotation of technicians who end up on call. Last night I had about 6 alerts come in from one location. It was about 1.5 hours of afterhours work and then it was resolved at about 11:00 PM.
 Later throughout the night, I had two more alerts come in around 1:45 and 3:00 AM that were short term disruptions that resolved themselves. In addition, I had two clients call in at 3:00 AM and then 5:00 AM about their VPN connection not operating. I missed these two calls, and my manager is furious with me because &quot;that is what is expected of the on-call person.&quot;
 Is it reasonable to expect someone who receives alerts like this, respond to them throughout the night and be expected to start work at 8:00AM the next day and work a full 8-hour shift? Yes, we do get additional compensation for the week of being on call, but my thinking is that setting these expectations is what results in mistakes being made and on the job injuries. I&#x27;m not saying that you shouldn&#x27;t work the next day but expecting someone to be up and running first thing and being sleep deprived is not a healthy thing.
 Am I wrong for thinking about it this way? What are your thoughts on this or what expectations does your company set?

                              <span>I am looking to audit Teams calls with some simple data: Date, Participants, Duration, Activity type.
 I have found some good help for auditing Teams &quot;meetings&quot; https://github.com/admindroid-community/powershell-scripts/blob/master/Audit%20Teams%20meetings/AuditTeamsMeetings.ps1 - this script generates a file that tracks internal &quot;meetings&quot;
 I have not found any resources or guides on how to audit &quot;activity type &#x3D; calls&quot; with PowerShell.
 Currently, I can navigate to admin.teams.microsoft.com &gt; Users &gt; Manage user &gt; $user &gt; Meetings &amp; calls and I can see call history there. But I can&#x27;t find any resources on how to grab that with PowerShell and export it to a different data source. Ideally I would like to get it into a CSV and later visualize it with PowerBI.

                              <span>Hi Friends,
 Some of our users access another company&#x27;s application, they use their email address and password from our sync&#x27;d AD.
 The thing is, their accounts all have expired passwords, yet they are still validated and can use this application.
 Should Microsoft not recognize its an expired password and deny access?
 If they log in locally on our domain they are prompted to change their password and can&#x27;t login until they do - but this cloud app simply authenticates them.
 Friends, what am I missing?

                              <span>Basically all the people who get paid more than they should at this company and think they are very important, are suddenly demanding I find a way to turn off 2FA on all their sites and services. Those here before me started the process of turning it on everywhere, and got stopped and canned for attempting it, even after getting the okay and explaining/communicating the process company-wide. They also want to make it so screens don&#x27;t lock automatically, and want to use a single shared account for all the public workstations (meeting rooms and such) instead of logging in with their own account or bringing a laptop for presentations.
 Basically C-Suite says: I want all the computers to be unlocked and working before I get near them
 But my experience says: 2FA everything, lock every screen after 10-20 minutes of no activity, detect and disconnect mouse jigglers if needed, and always use unique accounts even at public kiosks
 This company is constantly under attack from phishing/spoofing and can&#x27;t afford to pay for better M365 tiers to mitigate it. One of the IT Directors used the password Passwerd2020 a couple years ago, and the pen tester was able to use that account to find and access a full AD backup (don&#x27;t have more detail on this, but it was bad).
 Seems they should be freaking out about how bad their security is, instead the execs are just trying to poke more convenience holes. Is there a psychological trick or some kind of magic words that get this through? Can I just say it&#x27;s synergetic and get them to turn around? I&#x27;m not great at dealing with people who don&#x27;t accept the truth and want to see IT as an obstruction.
 It&#x27;s like having people say &quot;It&#x27;s really inconvenient, remove the deadbolts on my doors. The handle has a lock, why do I need two?&quot; over and over.

Internally hosted ticketing system running osTicket v1.17 (currently the latest version) is running on an Apache v2.4 web server and functions properly. 
 
An NGINX reverse proxy server is used to allow for https access internally and externally to said ticketing system.
 
 Problem:
 Microsoft Oauth2 for email authentication is not working. This guide works for getting everything setup with Microsoft Azure and then configuring the client, but the Redirect link errors out. 
 I&#x27;ve reached out to the developers and was told that as long as Apache rewrite mod is enabled, and it is, then I need to adjust the NGINX rules to allow the API urls to be rewritten successfully.

                              <span>One of my clients requested a laptop for a new manager they had hired. We told then we would have the laptop ready for setup today. So I go over to the client with the laptop, docking station, and two 27 inch monitors. 
 Manager comes off as a bit of jerk, but this isn&#x27;t a client I deal with much, so whatever. 
 Until I presented him with the laptop usage agreement. See, about a year ago, shortly after we added this client, we helped them draft Device Usage Agreements for users. 
 Pretty basic stuff. Date, Serial Number, condition issued, agreement for work purposes, cannot install/uninstall software, etc.
 Dude loses his absolute mind. Refuses to sign. Starts talking about how &quot;No one is going to tell him what he can or can&#x27;t do with his laptop!&quot;
 Anyway, owner was walking by during the rant. Guy no longer has a job or a laptop. Owner is convinced they dodged a bullet. 
 Happy Friday!

It was created as [user@company.com](mailto:user@company.com), I can still log in to it as an individual Apple account even though company.com is now registered as a domain in the new ABM account.
 [user@company.com](mailto:user@company.com) does not appear in the user list in the business admin page, and I can&#x27;t add it since the ID already exists. Is there a way to get this account into my managed environment?
 Also, when resetting a Mac, does it also reset the owner? I&#x27;m going to be testing and want to be able to emulate out of box.

 We are looking into using this for a different org (about 40 users), and found that it&#x27;s a bit cheaper through a 3rd-party. But I&#x27;m wondering if we will not have the same &quot;admin center&quot; abilities as the one I purchased through Microsoft. Does anyone have any experience with buying M365 Business Standard through a 3rd-party? We will be using on-prem AD and Exchange (probably Hybrid).

                              <span>Hi all,
 Just got a new role at a new place and noticed every switch here is a layer 3 switch performing some routing capabilities.
 Just curious about the industry and architecture. Is it typical to have access layer switches have ip routing enabled on it? (I saw some post that said there’s no need to turn it off)
 What are your thoughts!

                              <span>I&#x27;m wondering if there is a way to prevent spoofing with a approved email list in office 365
 I want to make a rule that checks if an email is part of our exchange and if not than to reject the message. we are pretty small only about 80 email users spread between 3 buildings. we never get hit with spoofed email of real people in our company but we always get hit with spoofed emails of our domain with a fake person and our users get tricked into giving info because they think this is someone new at a different building.
 I know I can do this in exchange rules but I would always need to add a new user to the approved list\ Group every time a new person is hired. I want it to be automatic when a user is created.

I have been looking through the firewall to see if there is a setting for the SMTP server or does it magically talk back to Sophos HQ and send the reports? (those are under logging &amp; reporting). Its for some reason stopped a few weeks before I started here. 
 Thanks,

                              <span>some time ago i decided to change jobs in a hope to get some motivation back (I was working night-shift in a medium sized enterprise). 
 i now got a job in a tech startup (30+ employees 70 R&amp;D) I have never worked in a start up before and most of my experience has been from larger organizations or enterprises. 
 Before i joined the company all systems administration has been done by DevOps and the CISO, so most if not all systems have never been setup properly, lots of software or other systems are still running trial versions that in some cases are expired with limited functionality. every day is a new challenge to just maintain a proper production. 
 I am hired as the IT systems administrator, so everything with IT, user management, Governance, risk and compliance falls under my scope. 
 With this whole mess that i am trying to balance I am slowly starting to lose my mind, and my motivation is long gone. 
 How do you keep the motivation up?
 it has been so bad for me that i have even considered if i should start working in a completely different line of work (oh yeah, I applied for a job in the local Lidl because the benefits are better then what i get now) 
 I actually don&#x27;t expect any replies, just needed to get this off my chest

And obviously, if you want to organize, you should use private email your company leaders can&#x27;t read. I&#x27;m just curious if anyone has seen a company that set up rules this aggressively? Has anyone here been the person to set up such rules?

                              <span>Hi all,
 So we have had an Android developer inform us that they were trying to use Android Studio with emulated (enrolled) devices but when trying to use certain features that require &quot;Verify Apps over USB&quot; to be disabled they can&#x27;t. When I looked at their device it shows that it is enabled and the config profile assigned is the same as the one on my test device.
 What is weird is that my device shows as disabled, we have the exact same config profile assigned and all I can see is that the developer options settings is allowed from the list of settings.
 Anyone know where this setting sits or is named under in android config profile settings.
 Thanks

                              <span>Has anyone else seen office 365, word excel etc lock up temporarily because it is searching for printer. However, at times the printer is not always available because the person is mobile, not in the office, and not connected to the VPN. 
 We can reproduce the issue regularly by going onto a network that doesn&#x27;t have permission to the print serve, open word, and edit margins. Word then locks up while searching for the printer (which it can&#x27;t find the default printer because they are not on the VPN or Network with permission to the printer). Eventually times out and seems to remember the time out for that session of word. It does cause other delays also
 Others are saying they get around it by setting a default printer to the local PDF writer but that isn&#x27;t really the best option. 
 It seems office is trying to connect to get the page setup information from the printer. Is there a setting somewhere to change this behavior. We are kind of stumped at the moment.

                              <span>Saw the post about the HR person who had to feel what we go through all the time. It really got me thinking about all the abuse I&#x27;ve had to deal with over the past 20-odd years. Fellow employees yelling over the phone about tickets that aren&#x27;t even in your queue. Long nights migrating servers or rewiring entire buildings, come in after zero sleep for &quot;one tiny thing&quot; and still get chewed out by the Executive&#x27;s assistant about it. Ask someone to follow a process and make a ticket before grabbing me in a hallway and you&#x27;d think I killed their cat.
 Our pay scales are out of wack, every company is just looking to undercut IT salaries because we &quot;make too much&quot;. So no one talks about it except on Glassdoor because we don&#x27;t want to find out the guy who barely does anything makes 10x my salary.
 Our responsibilities are usually not clearly defined, training is on our own time, unpaid overtime is &#x27;normal&#x27;, and we have to take abuse from many sides. &quot;Other duties as needed&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean I know how to fix the HVAC.
 Would a Worker&#x27;s Union be beneficial to SysAdmins/DevOps/IT/IS? Why or why not?
 I&#x27;m sorry if this is a stupid question. I guess I kind of wanted to vent. Have an awesome Read-Only Friday everyone.

One of the steps they&#x27;re telling the user is to make sure IE3.0 is installed, or to install axdist.exe for active X libraries. 
 Before I tell the user again that IE11 is (currently) PART OF Win10, and trying to install IE3.0 or IE 3.0 libraries for active X doesn&#x27;t make any sense - I&#x27;m doing a sanity check. How likely is this to break the Win 10 install if it&#x27;ll even install at all?

                              <span>Which one would be a better choice if my long term goal is to become a sysadmin? I have always struggled with math and foreign languages, so MIS seems like it may be a good route for me, but I am not sure how this degree holds up in the sysadmin world.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a long-time sysadm who never learned how to use Performance Monitor to determine how a server&#x27;s resources are being utilized over a period of time. I need to be able to monitor our backup server over a weekend to see if we are having any resource bottlenecks with CPU, Memory, Network, and Storage (I/O), including local disk, SAN and tape storage. Can i use Windows Performance Monitor to look at all of those resources over a weekend? Can anyone recommend a good &quot;Performance Monitor for dummies startup guide&quot;? either documented or instructional video? everytime i try to figure PM out, i always end of getting confused by all the options.

I have worked for about 2 years and everything become easy no there are no new experiences, my wage is normal not high not low. I&#x27;ve applied many times for larger companies with higher positions but I always decided to remain where I am because the wages weirdly are lower there even with higher position!! I started using my free time at work to learn web development I learned HTML, CSS, and now I am making my way in JavaScript, and guess what? I like this domain more than Network Engineering and I decided to keep improving and start moving my career to web development. but now after all this time I got an offer for a network admin position with like double my current wage in an MSP company but with more more Pressure and with more working hours 6days 9hours a day (I work now 5 days 7hours a day) I am lost what should I do know? should I move to this new position as a network admin or keep working where I am and improve myself in web development to shift my career?

More and more we are going the Chromebook route, much to our dismay, for our student one to one device program. Our Chromebooks connect to our WPA2 SSID via a username/password combo that goes through RADIUS. This is the only allowed user for authentication on that network aside from admins at the schools and their personal devices. Last year the password was cracked, it wasn&#x27;t very secure and had been the same for about eight years, so we decided once summer rolled around we would disable that user, create a new one and use a ridiculous 100 character password via a password generator. Fast forward to now and somehow the students at a high school have gotten ahold of this new password. We do …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just had to wade in to fix some IT issues after our DNS provider made some changes. I had to enable SPF to stop emails bouncing, which worked. But people still reported issues which I isolated to Google Calendar invites. So I set up DKIM for Gmail and go the DNS provider to add that TX record. 
 After enabling authentication, I&#x27;m finding the &quot;Sending email&quot; dialog in Thunderbird on my laptop sat there for ages before sending. Sending email from the GMail web UI didn&#x27;t do this. Now, some ten minutes or so later, I tried again from Thunderbird and there was a flicker of a pause, but nothing like before. So I&#x27;m hoping the initial long delays were just because the DNS changes were propagating. Can I hope this is the case? Can anyone verify that just after enabling DKIM, a pause sending emails is expected and is due to DNS which will ease over the next 24-48 hours?

 I read something about new / preview options to secure your azure MFA better. I think there were new options introduced. Something that should make it unphishable and at the same time address MFA fatigue.
 I just can&#x27;t find the post nor can I find it at Microsoft.
 Can someone point me there?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I work for a SMB that treats everything IT related as an expense. The CFO doesn&#x27;t want to deal with depreciation of IT assets. I can&#x27;t help but wonder if this is cause for some many of my frustrations, as we are under new leadership in the C suite who is trying to pinch every penny they can.

 some of our users cant login to ADFS. We are testing this webpage https://adfs.contoso.com/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.htm, but login prompt popup. In local intranet we have https://adfs.contoso.com, user is connected into internal network, hes getting internal ip of ADFS, but even If he entered right credentials connection is reset and login prompt popu again. I cant see any events on ADFS (have verbose logging). I dont really know where could be a problem. Hes using Chrome, Edge, Firefox nothing works. 
 Any idea? Ty

 Is there any way to block specific Microsoft Store Apps via GPO?
 Or even better, to block them all but have a list of selected Apps which are allowed? 
 (I am not talking about blocking the Microsoft Store in its entirety, i only want to block/allow specific apps)

                              <span>Yes, of course it&#x27;s DNS....
 I&#x27;ve got one server (Windows Server 2022 VM on Nutanix AHV) that&#x27;s having problems doing DNS lookups. Not consistently, it can usually ping the DCs in its domain and in the forest root above it. But the lookups tend to be slow. And many other servers in the domain don&#x27;t resolve.
 I&#x27;ve done a netsh winsock reset and a reboot, which I thought fixed it (I could resolve a hostname that wasn&#x27;t previously working) but just seems to have made it a little better, not fixed it altogether. I&#x27;ve removed the virtual NIC and put a new one in. I&#x27;ve switched temporarily to DHCP. The issue persists. It&#x27;s using the two domain controllers as DNS servers, the same as every other server in that domain, and they&#x27;re all fine.
 &quot;Test-Netconnection DC1 -p 53&quot; connects successfully (as does DC2).
 If I do an nslookup for anything, it finds it. But if I immediately ping it, chances are, it won&#x27;t resolve the name.
 Name resolution fails regardless of whether I just search for the NETBIOS name or the FQDN. I&#x27;ve tried putting a random dot at the end of both as per some ancient article I found on Google, but that doesn&#x27;t work either.
 This server has just gone live to the whole business, so I really don&#x27;t want to rebuild it if I can avoid it, but I&#x27;ll try most non-destructive things out of hours. I&#x27;ve got good backups of it but I don&#x27;t really know when this started.

 Is there a way to make external bootable SSD to work in only one specific computer (Mac OS) ?

                              <span>Hi all
 I&#x27;m looking for ways to centrally manage access to customer, and internal servers. Servers are 95% accessed by RDP, if not, TeamViewer.
 Some customers we&#x27;ve got shared admin credentials to, others we&#x27;ve got personal credentials on, and we&#x27;ll need to be able to use both - with personal ones only known to the individual user.
 Today we&#x27;re using Royal TS and managing document (RDP/gateway/credential folder) access with Azure Security Groups -&gt; AADDS Security Groups.
 We&#x27;re a Windows house, fully onboard with Azure, with all that it entails.
 ​
 Need to have:
  
Centrally managed access controle. This can happen any which way, fx via Security Groups.
 
Logging. Access log is a must have.
 
Automated emergency access.
 
Azure Active Directory, or Azure Active Directory Domain Services integration.
 
Windows and Mac support.
 
Helpful vendor support.
 
Session recording.
 
GDPR compliant. 
 
Admin and user rights.
 
 ​
 Nice to have:
  
PIM/PAM support.
 
Password management from the same vendor - for passwords not related to the servers.
 
PowerShell manageable if applicable (it&#x27;s nice not to have to go through every single setup point, for hundreds of customers).
 
Auditing for GDPR (if applicable).
 
 ​
 If PAM is included, I&#x27;m looking for cheaper alternatives than Delinia/Thycotic and Cyberark. (Though if a good price can be provided, they&#x27;re in the loop)

                              <span>I have a RDS deployment that i am trying to get SSO for the &quot;RemoteApp and Remote Desktop connection&quot; feed url to work.
 I have trusted certificates on all RDS roles.
 I have changed the Authentication Method on RDWeb in IIS to Windows Authentication.
 i have Changed the web.config in the Pages folder, commented out Form Auth and the needed modules and security sections.
 I have changed the Default.aspx to use bPrivateMode &#x3D; true
 I have deployed the &quot;Allow Delegating default credentials&quot; set to TERMSRV/*.company.local, also tried with FQDN of all RDS server.
 I have added all RDS servers to Site to Zone Assignment List, tried zone both 1 and 2 with FQDN
 Set the &quot;Logon Options&quot; to &quot;Automatic logon with current username and password&quot;.
 I have disabled &quot;Prompt for credentials on the client computer&quot;.
 I have deployed the &quot;Use Locally logged-on credentials&quot;.
 I have specified the SHA1 thumbprint as trusted RDP publisher from the Connection Broker certificate.
 In both Edge(Chromium) and Internet Explorer the SSO works for the urls needed.
 https://rdweb.company.local/RDWeb
 https://rdweb.company.local/RDWeb/Feed/webfeed.aspx
 But when i try to add the url in the &quot;RemoteApp andf Remote Desktop Connections&quot; under controlpanel it says &quot;Incorrect username or password&quot;, this makes the auto deployment of the url impossible.
 Is there a setting i have forgotten to set or is this a lost cause?

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 A really strange but replicable issue has arised.
 When a user forwards an email in the ios outlook app that contains pictures (such as a logo in the signature or inline images) ALL images in the email (including previous mails in the same email) become one of the images. 
 This only happens if you select &quot;Expand previous mesasge&quot; (rough translation, sorry) during the forward. You can see that all images gets turned inte one of the images in the &quot;edit-mode&quot; but that is not necessarily the same one that gets sent.
 We have the lates ios outlook and ios 16.03
 Have you seen anything like this?
 To try it yourself: 
  
Open an email with pictures 
 
Select Forward
 
Click &quot;Expand Message&quot; / &quot;Show full message&quot;
 
All the images gets turned into one of the pictures
 
 Optional:
  
Send the email
 
All the images could turn into one of the other images in the mail

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m looking to get a new UPS for our office as the current one is essentially a very heavy paper weight. 
 I&#x27;m not looking to spend loads and really only need enough backup time to shut everything down safely (5-10 minutes max).
 The equipment I have is below:
 Watchguard M270: 75W
 US-48-500W: 500W x 2
 UAP-AC-Pro: 9W x 3
 Poweredge R320: 350W x 2
 HP Microserver: 200W 
 Total: 2002W 
 Preferably I&#x27;d like it under £1000 but could stretch to perhaps £1250-1500 if really required.
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Dear fellow Sysadmins,
 I&#x27;ve been working at an old fashioned (small and rather niche) MSP for the last 10 years and will soon make the move to a well-known and bigger company. With a good bump to my salary. As smaller MSPs are, I&#x27;ve got a rather broad spectrum of skills but I am no master in a lot of those. Well, that may be knocking myself a bit down, but you get the gist.
 My new employer put me into a department that will also be focused on providing managed services with some focus on cloudy stuff as well as even providing private cloud instances to customers. I am destined to be a network-guy (but it could change to something else if it fits, I am pretty open to other positions), which fits the focus of my previous position, but with a lot of focus to newer technologies like software defined networking / SD-WAN and the like which I have pretty much no clue about. (Well, I setup a vxlan peering on my proxmox-homelab-cluster and connected three VMs with it, but that&#x27;s about it :-D)
 I guess I made a good impression and I was pretty honest about this lack of knowledge on my part, so there will probably be provided training at the start and I will not be expected to have this knowledge. I think I showed enough willingness to learn new stuff and general interest in IT to be a future asset to my employer.
 Be that as it may, tldr, I&#x27;d love to read up and learn about the newer network-concepts like SDN/SD-WAN and stuff in this direction but I am not sure where to start exactly. Can someone point me in the right direction? Or maybe recommend some good papers/videos about this stuff? I&#x27;d like not to focus on a specific manufacturer, but if they provide good content I don&#x27;t mind.
 Thank you very, very much!

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m working on a shell script to get the download link for this Lansweeper agent. 
 The original link is https://content.lansweeper.com/lsagent-mac/
 However, I would like to get this redirect link: https://cdn.lansweeper.com/download/10.2.0/0/LsAgent-osx.dmg
 I want to use the original link so I can always get the latest version.
 The curl script I used was this:
 curl -Ls -o /dev/null -w %{url_effective} https://content.lansweeper.com/lsagent-mac/ 
 But I keep getting the original link: https://content.lansweeper.com/lsagent-mac/
 How to get the redirect link that is used to download?
 Thank you.

 I am not angry. I&#x27;m more disappointed and frustrated.
  
Strike one: I only go there once a year to register. In the last three years, my account ID has changed three times. I have three ID&#x27;s from Swizzonic.
 Strike two: I received an email invoice with a link to renew. I went to renew, using the existing user/pass combo. I was told my password was invalid. I checked the domain, just to be sure I was not being scammed. billing.swizzonic.ch/. I tried logging in a couple more times and was locked out for too many attempts.

                              <span>My firm is keen on code signing all code/scripts written internally and I was after some advice on the best/simplest way to implement this. None of the code will be used externally - only for internal use and for whitelisting. 
 We have a MS CA but we also have the ability to grab a third party cert. There are about 10 people that will need to be able to sign. We use yubikeys so we have the ability to leverage them. 
 Anyone else do this in a small dev team with no code being sent externally? To be honest I&#x27;ve never dabbled with code signing before and most info is for Dev firms and large companies needing a lot of people to do it..

I was issued a USB-C Nano and man does this model defeat that purpose. I have no desire to remove it regularly, even when I let me fingernails grow they don&#x27;t budge (as if my specific laptop model wasn&#x27;t notorious for already having known-too-snug USB ports...) At least put a lip with a hole in it so I can yoink it or something.

                              <span>Our DATTO seems to be dying and I can&#x27;t help but feel like I&#x27;m being taken for a ride by either the MSP or DATTO.... It is giving esoteric errors that the MSP says DATTO says are due to a corrupted disk. The whole ordeal has been dragging out over weeks and I&#x27;m basically 
 &quot;can i replace the disk?&quot; no answer to that question.... 
 &quot;can they check the disk&quot; &quot;ok we&#x27;ll ask them....&quot;. Two days later I finally get a response that the disk is fine... but something is wrong with the (out of warranty) device. They want me to sign a new 3 year agreement and they&#x27;ll give me a free box (I&#x27;m on the cusp of not wanting to work with this MSP anymore so a commitment is not high on my list!). But they also increase the rate by about 30% - which seems extravagant. I hate not being backed up and I&#x27;m pretty angry at myself for not getting VEAMM community up and running as part of my 2 onsite backup system. 
 I haven&#x27;t had offsite replication in over two weeks. I&#x27;m unsure if my onsite/on-device backups are good or not. My SQL server backups are backing up to the attached NAS share without error, so... i guess those are ok... but they&#x27;re not offsite. After weeks of no backup I&#x27;m ready to sign fucking anything, but such a strong increase sounds like a ball twist. 
 Is DATTO, now owned by kaseya (mind you, DATTO saved me from ransomware that a Kaseya server distributed so... fuck Kaseya and I&#x27;m extremely sad that they purchased DATTO), jacking up prices? Or is my MSP taking me for a ride? A $2000increase on top of an already expensive service is pretty fucking harsh, in my opinion.

                              <span>I have a client whose Windows Server 2003 device&#x27;s motherboard died. He wants to get the system running on another computer again as the system contains software that powers some important industrial machines.
 I know that with Windows 10 and later you can just plug in a hard drive into any computer and it will re-adjust to new hardware and boot but with older Windows operating systems it will just blue screen because you will have to sysprep it first to be able to move it to another machine. But I can&#x27;t boot this device anymore to sysprep it.
 What are my options to revive this operating system into another machine?
 Thanks in advance.

 seems to have fixed issues related to office apps / teams / network dropouts
 been battling these issues for months, and only in the last 24 hours I&#x27;ve tried uninstalling this app and it seems to have helped a lot of my users.
 fingers crossed this is the permanent fix.
 ​
 EDIT: lots of people saying &quot;image/MDT ur endpoints&quot;... These laptops are sent straight from vendor and are pushed via azure autopilot/Intune. This isn&#x27;t uncommon for larger enterprises. Manufacturer&#x27;s drivers still end up on these machines even though they are specced for our org,, this scenario is just different to what you&#x27;d see if you have the opportunity to get hands on with every single laptop you order.
 EDIT #2: removed some snarkiness from my initial edit. It was a long day, sorry 🙂
 EDIT #3: if this is helping you, u/SpongederpSquarefab pointed out that &quot;Annoyling Dell Command installs Dell Optimizer lol&quot;. Important to note.

 Basic auth is gone for Exchange online, which isn&#x27;t an issue for Windows or Mac users, but for our wonderful Linux userbase this is getting quite problematic it seems. 
 Microsoft is saying use an OAuth app to authenticate via IMAP/POP/SMTP.
 I am not new to OAuth app integrations, but this is a bit out of my league, and I have quite some concerns: 
  
It is saying to give &quot;application&quot; level access for IMAP and POP - not delegated
 It is saying to give the service principal for that specific application access to a specific Mailbox
  
Now this combination makes me think that I need to create a unique App integration for each linux user and assign this unique service principal to the users mailbox? 
 I cannot create one App integration with one secret, which I give to every linux user, and then assign the service principal to each of their mailboxes, each linux user can access every linux users mailbox?
 I don&#x27;t really see an easy solution for this mess, how are you doing this?

                              <span>If a hacker got into a system, can&#x27;t he/she use LAPS to obtain additional credentials? If they can&#x27;t (because that account doesn&#x27;t have rights to access LAPS) then they wouldn&#x27;t have been able to move laterally anyway (I guess?). I guess I don&#x27;t understand how LAPS helps.

 This was just announced and I think this will help a lot of people out there so I wanted to share. (no affiliation with stack overflow, just thought it was neat)
 As a side quest, what other sites are out there that give you the ability to easily store an offline copy that you update every few weeks?

                              <span>So like title says im having issues with a radius server, i have 2 meraki aps setup on the dashboard which have static ips on them, same as another site, and i set up radius before and it worked fine, we had the dhcp server crash and moved dhcp to the firewall. 
 ​
 Since then the radius hasnt worked. gives an error message of 
 &quot;An Access-Request message was received from RADIUS client 10.3.0.231 with a Message-Authenticator attribute that is not valid.&quot;
 ​
 This is on a windows 2012 server on latest october updates. Originally the merakis were on dhcp so the ip changed, which i assumed the issue was, changed and didnt work. changed the shared key incase it was wrong, didnt work, turned off needs to containg authenticator attrible ... still nothing.
 ​
 Any suggestions

 ​
 However, I have a user reporting they cannot delete any quarantined messages, even old ones, from the quarantine page. I don&#x27;t recall configuring a setting for this behavior, is this the global default? How long do they stay until being auto-deleted?

 One day I found put that we have access to SharePoint and Power Platforms with our Office 365 subscription. I approached head of IT wishing to give it a try to build up a simple HR IS, well I didn&#x27;t have a system in mind, just something to ditch those pink and green paper forms. Head of IT refused because he wanted to hire an external company to build HR IS for us. He told me I was new and they have been doing business like this for 20 years. I argu…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got one user at one client that, starting yesterday, is getting hammered with spam, but it&#x27;s not your typical viagra or porn spam. They&#x27;re getting signed up to hundreds of different websites, lots of different languages, mostly european, some asian, lots of dutch, german and polish, and we&#x27;re getting all the account creation emails. Obviously they&#x27;re on a list somewhere that got sold, but wondered if there some sort of new wordpress form or other vulnerability that&#x27;s being exploited. Whatever bot it is, seems to hit a website multiple times; whatever it&#x27;s filling out in the forms for a name is random characters as some of those forms copy back that data to the email.
 Blocking some of it with geoip policies, some with language polices, but it&#x27;s hardly making a dent. We&#x27;re using barracuda. I can&#x27;t find any commonality in the headers other than some have references to a php mailer in the xheaders, but that&#x27;s not nearly enough to fingerprint on to block.
 Told the user that if it doesn&#x27;t settle down in a couple of days, we may have to dump his current email to a group and get him a new address.
 Anyone seeing similar or know the source? Better yet, have some sort of magic regex that catches all of it?

                              <span>hello sysadmins,
 ​
 I am looking for people that work in IT preferably sysadmins that are willing to fill out a form for school research purposes.
 The form only takes a few minutes and really helps me get my assignment/task done.
 The form is about your work/what do you do and where do you work.
 ​
 If you cant fill it out for whatever reason please let me know. I posted this on r/homelab and people told me they couldn&#x27;t because of NDA reasons please let me know which question so i can change/ remove it.
 ​
 thanks in advance to everyone that helps in any way or form

 Has anyone that is familar with Apache, messed with this? I am unable to figure out what version we have with the McAfee EPO on a server and hoping someone here can shed some light on how I figure out this. What manual way is there to verify the version? As it is not showing in programs.
 ​
 This is a Critical 9.8 vulnerability.

                              <span>Hello, 
 I would like to build a preproduction environment completely isolated from my production env.
 I&#x27;m looking at the best way to do it.
 Of course I would like to build something that is fully replicated from my prod. 
 Right now my production Vms are hosted in a vcenter.
 My company does alreay have a lab vcenter and we would like to clone the prod Vms into this lab vcenter.
 We don&#x27;t have the entreprise license of vmware, so the crossed vcenter functionnality is not available. 
 My question is more about how am I supposed to replicate the production ? 
 I can use cron with rsync or ansible to transfer files from the prod to the lab but I&#x27;m wondering if there isn&#x27;t a better solution ? 
 Do you guys have any feedback on how to build a pre production environment, fully replicated with the production servers ? 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Our users have had issues with how the current meeting systems are setup. Currently we have a Google Meet hardware kit, Apple TV, and PC. Google meet obviously for the google meetings, Apple TV for mirroring the iPads when nobody is joining remotely, and the PC for all other meeting solutions that don&#x27;t work with Google Meet. Since it&#x27;s budget time we&#x27;re looking for an all-in-one solution for joining meetings and the Smart board 6000s Pro seems like a pretty legit solution but I just don&#x27;t know anybody who&#x27;s actually used it. According to the product page it can join all of the major video conferencing platforms, and supports AirPlay mirroring, so it would wipe out all of the extra we have and users wouldn&#x27;t have to change much. Does it have a lot of hardware compatibility in terms of webcams? Is it easy for users to use? Does it give a good experience when using it on all of the different meeting platforms? Anything I&#x27;m not thinking of?

 However, I cannot write to /sbin neither from recovery or from normal boot with sudo. 
 Also, I do not need to hear that SIP is great and all that. I need to write to /sbin/ for work, end of. 
 It seems to be that all &#x27;ways&#x27; of doing it are now not working. Any solutions? I noticed that the permissions still appear as restricted even when I mount -uw /

 Is there a way to create an alert when some read/write permission is given to a specific mailbox? Kinda in the way when a redirect rule is created, it gives an alert.
 My objective is to create an warning if someone tries to read a C-level mailbox, for example. 
 For context: this is Exchange Online - Office365

 I&#x27;m trying to enforce my DevOps/SRE skills and searching for some kind of demo project (like a simple web page) to be able to deploy it using DevOps and SRE tools/principles. The issue is that I don&#x27;t know what kind of app to develop, also I have no idea and I&#x27;m not interested in frontend.
 Does anyone know some good exercises to follow to create an infrastructure to practice SRE / DevOps skills? is there some kind of awesome GitHub repo or similar? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>We&#x27;re having issues with four Server 2012 R2 where MsSense.exe keeps crashing after an update of Defender tonight. Is anyone else having these issues?
 We have no idea why this is happening and I can&#x27;t seem to find any threads where people are experiencing the same thing.

                              <span>I know that it has always been considered best practice to do clean installations but as we near the 2012 R2 end of life what is your opinion on this? I have done some in-place upgrades in my home lab with no issues but I am curious if anyone has had any problems doing this in production environments? Particularly with App servers or RDS servers where migration of the roles might be kind of a pain.

 Has anyone tried restoring the image backup using cli commands in windows. I haven&#x27;t got any success in restoring the urbacked up file (.vhd, .vhdz) to the bootable .vhd file for hyperv or vbox. I have tried assemble_disk_image bat file in urbackup to restore to combine multiple .vhd files in the incremental backup to single bootable .vhd file but got errors in doing so.

 Is there an API I can use to update the teams room&#x27;s calendar with events from an external source to keep them &quot;in sync&quot; with each other?

 What are your techniques? I recently migrated from SNOW/Remedy to Ivanti/DesktopCentral and it&#x27;s a bit different from what I used to. There has to be a way to get better in designing relationships in my head efficiently

 I&#x27;ve created this PS script to check on something in Citrix, but I don&#x27;t know how to get it to email via our internal SMTP server, I&#x27;m tried a few examples via Google.
 The PS is:
 $obj &#x3D; Get-BrokerDesktopGroup | Where-Object PublishedName -eq GSelector_W10 | Select-Object TotalDesktops, DesktopsAvailable, DesktopsInUse, Sessions, DesktopsUnregistered, DesktopsDisconnected, DesktopsFaulted, DesktopsPreparing If (($obj.DesktopsAvailable -eq 0) -or ($obj.TotalDesktops -eq 0)) { Send-MailMessage -From citrix-alert@domain.com -to me@domain.com -subject &quot;Test Email&quot; -body &quot;Test message&quot; -smtpserver smtpinternal.domain.com -port 25 } 
 Nothing arrives.
 However I was also trying to add the other values from the PS script so the body of the email message is something like:
  TotalDesktops &#x3D; DesktopsAvailable &#x3D; DesktopsInUse &#x3D; Sessions &#x3D; DesktopsUnregistered &#x3D; DesktopsDisconnected &#x3D; DesktopsFaulted &#x3D; DesktopsPreparing &#x3D; 
 Is this possible? I&#x27;m getting a little lost.
 Thanks

 This is a two part question. First part neccessary, in second topic I am not so sure about.
 Has anybody scripted to check for new updates, when found, do download and export to share? Later Dell servers iDRAC-s will check the share and upgrade its firmwares (BIOS, iDRAC) without reboot. 
 Once a month or so when operating systems get updates, servers will be rebooted automatically and upgraded firmwares will be in use. Do I dare to automate many server reboots in a mentioned way at once and soon possibly find out that many servers are not booting in case of firmware bug or something like that?

                              <span>Hey All,
 So I am trying to solve a very annoying issue that users are starting to notice and while I am aware this probably should go to the r/office365 section I am more interested to see if sysadmins have seen this and if they have, how did you solve it?
 Basically the users would be working in Outlook with calendars open capturing meetings and the like. When changing from one day to the next at one point Outlook will not draw the bottom part of the calendar and wherever you click Outlook will click that amount of cells not rendered up or down. See screenshot for the example, I clicked in the blank space but the selection was above my click. https://imgur.com/a/KxOkHv6
 Initially I thought this was an Azure Virtual Machine issue but I have since been able to recreate it on a physical machine as well. I have tried the latest Office beta but the issue persists. I have reinstalled Office, recreated the profile, used Online only mode, tried the reg key to disable hardware acceleration, tried different hardware, tried different accounts. At this point I don&#x27;t know what else to try and suspect it is a flaw in Office because I have seen this with a different user who has reproduced it in Excel workbooks that have formulas that changes the display while it is running.
 I have a open ticket with MS on this but I thought I would ask here as well. Anyone else seen this before? If so how did you solve it?

                              <span>Howdy sysadmin lords. I’ve been offered a SRE role with a large tech company. The JD was a little generic and SRE role descriptions online vary a fair bit. So I wanted to know what the role entails from some of you? I come from a sysadmin/infrastructure background with devops but no SWE experience. Is your role stressful? Is there a requirement for software dev? Before you ask I’m also reflecting these questions to the employer.

                              <span>Dear sysadmins,
 I need your advice to progress in my career. 
 A little about myself. 
 I’m about to complete 2 years as system administrator. Overall 5 years of experience in this industry. I started from tech support. Professional certification earned: CCNP core not specialization. High school not a graduate. 
 I want to earn OSCP and move towards Pentesting, general cyber security. Good idea?
 What should be my next step? What certifications would benefit me in the future?
 Thank you for your time for this. Cheers!

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve got a curly one I&#x27;m trying to work through and figure someone has been there and done that.
 I&#x27;m trying to hit a web server on a short lived AWS EC2 instance to diagnose an issue. I&#x27;m looking to tunnel web traffic back over SSH but I&#x27;m not having much luck.
 There isn&#x27;t direct access to the VPC so I&#x27;m using a proxy command in my SSH config using AWS session manager to access it. Connecting via SSH works fine but now I&#x27;m trying to tunnel on top of that to hit the web server and I&#x27;m hitting a wall.
 My current SSH config looks something like ... And it allows me to SSH to the instance
 Host i-* IndentityFile ~important.pem User ec2-user UserKnownHostsfike /dev/null ServerKeepAlive 60 ProxyCommand sh -c &quot;aws ssm start-session --target &amp;h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters &#x27;portNumber&#x3D;%p&#x27;&quot;
 I&#x27;ve tried adding a Dynamic forward and and tweaking my browser to use that as the proxy but no dice
 Anyone got any ideas? I&#x27;m stumped

                              <span>Dear,
 I&#x27;m tasked with a very nice task from HR :-)
 They want to display a splash screen on computers after logging in on a specific date.
 It will be used to congratulate endusers with their birthday/wish them a happy halloween/happy new year and so on.
 In this first phase they will only use this for halloween. They want to play a short movie/gif to wish users a happy halloween. So this is static on a specific date/for every user.
 With GPO I can create a taskschd for this.
 Does anyone know a program or something like that (lightweight ofcourse) to perform this task? Eg: a media player that starts immediate full screen and exit/quit automatically for example.
 Thanks for giving me tips in this &quot;nice&quot; task ;-)

 My supervisor don&#x27;t wanna mess with self-hosting and have no problem paying for a decent system
 The biggest thing he wants it to include is AAD/Intune integration so that the system will pull employees and their assigned devices from intune, so that when we make changes in intune it will automatically update in the Inventory system as well, he doesn&#x27;t want to manually assign anything if thats avoidable (stuff like monitors we will manually assign of course)
 It should also include stuff like a decent software license management, QR Code generation / scanning and any other useful features that might make our job easier

                              <span>As a sysadmin, I&#x27;ve decided to try W11 myself in my laptop at work in order to avoid turning my users into guinea pigs when the first W11 PCs start to come. After 24h of use, the disaster has exceeded my expectations: 
 - 2 PC hangs in the first 24h.
 - Snipping tool --&gt; Print, attempts to open a print dialog then disappears without doing nothing.
 - Copy that same picture and paste into notepad --&gt; Print. Stays &quot;printing&quot; forever but it doesn&#x27;t print.
 - Printers --&gt; [Select printer] --&gt; Open queue --&gt; &quot;You need an app to open ms-print-queue&quot;. Going &quot;shell:::{A8A91A66-3A7D-4424-8D24-04E180695C7A}&quot;, print queue opens fine. Test page from the printer prints no issues.
 - Run ESET installer --&gt; &quot;Do you want to look for the app in the Store?&quot; instead of just installing. Even selecting &quot;Yes&quot;, it throws an error.
 Everything above wasn&#x27;t happening 24h ago with W10. Dear Microsoft, if the product is not ready, DON&#x27;T RELEASE IT.
 I&#x27;m sorry, but needed that rant.

                              <span>Hello,
 Recently I changed my LDAP login credentials, and I need to update them on SnipeIT configuration also.
 When I try to update it on LDAP Settings page it doesn&#x27;t change anything. Every time I click &quot;Save&quot; nothing is saved and everything stays the same as before I entered new stuff.
 Thanks

 Not good.
 I&#x27;m not allowed to just jank the time several hours leaving overlaps or gaps in the timestamps. So I have to be very gentle.
 What is a good way to very slowly correct the time over a few days, weeks even. Adjust a minute every hour or something like that.

                              <span>Hi all,
 We have since last week, blue screens on 3 platforms / Microsoft Surface - HP laptop - HP desktop
 People can connect to their session but when it finishes to load, they have a blue screen, this can happens 3/4 times in a row when users restart before they can use their computer.
 The errors are either Kernel Failure or Driver failure.
 We deploy our OS (Win10 21h2) with sccm.
 We are trying to find what is happening, we looked into event logs, updated drivers and firmware, forced Windows Update but it keeps happening. We have quite a few GPO at logon and some script at startup but nothing was changed these past 2 weeks. We don&#x27;t understand why we get these blue screens like that.
 Do you have any other ideas for this ?

Reading up on it, apparently you can get your insurance cheaper by using it. I mentioned this to finance about a year after I was there, once comfortable &amp; no one appears to know about that. I assume its because not all insurance agree to that.
 So smartwater, for those that don&#x27;t know, is liquid laced with &quot;code&quot; that has your company details. You paste it on your kit. If your kit is stolen and the police recover it, they are supposed to check for smartwater. Take a sample, send it to smartwater who&#x27;ll reveal who the kit belongs to.
 It was always claimed &quot;Its invisible and difficult to remove.&quot; So I questioned this several years ago to them via Twitter. I got blocked. I …</span>

                              <span>Hi All,
 I work for a MSP and we&#x27;re thinking of trying to replace some Cisco VDSL modems with the Proscend VDSL2 SFP, just trying to wrap my head around the potential configurations that we might use for this.
 Our current plan is to stick the SFP into the switch for the clients (Most clients only have 1-2 switches, generally a Cisco of some sort, 24-48 ports with 2-4 SFP ports.) and then setting one single SFP and one single RJ45 port into their own VLAN and using that to bridge the SFP Modem with WAN interface on the router. However, for the router to connect to the ISP over this SFP modem, it requires tagging a VLAN on the WAN interface.
 If we were to set the SFP and RJ45 ports to access ports to some random VLAN - e.g. 2000, and then set the router to tag VLAN2 on the WAN port, would the switch see the VLAN2 tag on these access ports and then just strip the VLAN tag?
 One of our other options is just a SFP to RJ45 media converter, but then that requires extra plugs, and an extra point if failure, not to mention more cost rather than just plugging the SFP into a switch and partitioning the switch out, not as costly as a router but a cost that the client would need to bear.
 Alternatively, we could just upgrade all of our clients to routers with SFP ports, but then we&#x27;re going to need to convince the clients to put the money in to upgrade their routers in the cases where they don&#x27;t already have routers with SFP ports.
 Any opinions on the best way forward while still being cost efficient?
 Thanks all!

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I&#x27;m looking to add voip phones to our current network and was wondering how best to configure it given the current setup. Currently, it&#x27;s a flat network 192.168.1.1 /24 with our 48 port switch on eth1 port of ubiquiti edgerouter 4. The switch has multiple desktops(~10) and printers connecting to some win servers (setup as a terminal server). The voip phones would be added at each station sitting in front of the respective desktop on the same line. In order to power the phones, a second poe switch will be added as well.
  
 1) Firstly, should I be plugging one switch into another daisy chain style so the phones can see the SBC controller I&#x27;ve setup on the win server? In doing so, all uplink data will be running through a single shared 1GB line which is not great but it&#x27;s only 10 u…</span>

                              <span>Hey folks, I maintain a small coaxial cable TV plant for a campus with a few dormitory buildings (about 400 rooms total). It&#x27;s really simple with the CATV headend (digital QAM modulator) and we pipe in our licensed channels to it in addition to a few in house channels for signage and information. We&#x27;re making a new dormitory that will be all ethernet and no coax to the room to use simple digital CATV enabled TVs. 
 It appears the hospitality IPTV market is large from fancy ones that have splash pages that welcome you with customized information to your room. I do notice that at the hotels a lot of them have set top boxes behind the hospitality TV and this seems complex. I feel like buying hospitality grade smart TVs will lock us in or perhaps the set top box is the way to go? How much do these systems cost to maintain and license? is it even worth it?
 I really like the simplicity of coax CATV, just scan for new channels (the channel plan rarely changes) and go, so I can just push to get coax installed in the new dorm to each room and extend CATV to the dorm with HFC fiber. Change my mind?
 One possible driving factor for IPTV is to also allow users to watch IPTV on their desktop or mobile devices. I can technically hit the multicast IP on the distribution side (source to QAM modulator) and watch it in VLC but it&#x27;s not too user friendly. I don&#x27;t know how many users would actually watch our channels on mobile. I have tested Haivison&#x27;s HMP product and have always wondered if there are competition products to this. Is there anything open source in this space at all?

It could&#x27;ve been easier to just share the topology but I&#x27;ll do my best explaining it. This is for our networking fundamentals class and not a GRADED activity. I&#x27;m working with a partner since this is our lab activity. We&#x27;re pretty much stuck with this and worried that she can&#x27;t perform further practicals without solving this one first.
 Basically here&#x27;s the setup:
  
All devices have unique static IPs assigned
 All devices have the same subnet mask
 2 switches (same models, both VLAN 1)
 2 end PC end-devices
  
​
  
 S1 VLAN 1 172.18.1.1 255.255.192.0 
  
 S2 VLAN 1 172.18.1.2 255.255.192.0 
  PC-A NIC 172.18.1.50 255.255.192.0

                              <span>Is there any way to configure MAC addresses to be registered on a VLAN? I ask because I work for a company that provides customer service for multiple organizations (meaning that each organization is setup with their own VLAN). Many the users to these different companies are constantly moving to different cubicles bringing with them their registered Cisco phone. This means that every they move I then have search the network for the MAC and then add that port to the correct VLAN. I am looking for thoughts on how to improve this process so I can stop spending my days playing Whac-A-Mole with VLAN changes. I have started adventuring down the idea of possibly creating a Ansible or Python script that would search the network, find the port and configure the list of MAC’s for that VLAN. Any ideas or suggestions?

                              <span>Hey
 I&#x27;m searching for aggregation switch for UniFi Pro access switches but the thing is that it must not be neither UniFi nor Cisco. I really don&#x27;t want to answer why so don&#x27;t ask please.
 I would like that switch to aggregate UniFi over 10G SFP+ link each. Switch should be at least 12 ports, better 24. Can have any additional over for ex. 40G but I don&#x27;t care about it much.
 If I could use Ubiquiti I would choose USW-Pro-Aggregation.
 If I could use Cisco I would choose Nexus 3064.
 I&#x27;m looking for something around these. Was given a tip for Huawei but I&#x27;m not sure. I personally worked with Juniper and HP (before aruba lines) and I don&#x27;t see a problem with either.
 Not really fond of MikroTik but I&#x27;m not even sure if they offer anything around what I&#x27;m looking for.
 Any other ideas? Switch can be used, it doesn&#x27;t need to be brand new (so I allow older EoLed models).
 Would be great if anyone could post models that I can look for and which definitely not even consider.

                              <span>I have a Cisco 9407 that creates ARP entries for several IP addresses that don&#x27;t exist. These show up as incomplete in a &quot;show arp&quot;, return immediately after being cleared and they do not time out of their own (even after waiting several hours).
 The VLAN these IPs belong to only exists on this switch and is not allowed on any trunks. I have also crosschecked the access ports assigned to the VLAN and confirmed that none of them have any of these IPs. While there is obviously reference to the network these IPs belong to in the config there are no direct references to them.

                              <span>I have a client who has a PtP setup with Unifi NanoBeam 5AC&#x27;s between their home and an event area about 900 feet away, distanced is reported by the Unifi device. At the home I get about 700 Mbps on wired LAN with speed test at fast.com. When I plug my computer in to the end of the PtP link at the event area, I get about 190 Mbps down and 180 Mbps up after the speed test. Event area is at the other end of a farm area so as far as I know, no electrical/wireless interference in the path.
 The speeds are more than enough for what is needed at the event area but the client wants to expand internet to a barn that has line of sight with the event area, it is about 1400 feet away (distanced is reported by the Unifi device). The barn will then have a PtMP that aims to 3 homes. I would include an aerial view but I can&#x27;t share images here.
 My concerns are as follows:
  
How can I increase bandwidth between home and event area so that the barn and 3 homes can also benefit from the Internet circuit? What stats do I need to review and settings to tweak to try to increase bandwidth to near theoretical max throughput?
 If the home reaches consistently 700 Mbps, what is the max I should expect after the first PtP hop?
  
Do you have any specific resources I can read or watch to have a better understanding on how to optimize the wireless links?

                              <span>So we&#x27;ve been dealing with some issues regarding Spectrum speeds/reliability for awhile now. We&#x27;re being charged $400 a month for the 50x50 line itself (In the city), along with additional costs for things like a managed firewall. We&#x27;ve had stability issues quite frequently in the past with this line, but the stability seems to be better now. 
 50mb/s is not meeting our needs though. I understand the high cost is to guarantee these minimum speeds, though our speeds don&#x27;t seem to really ever go above that. A shared line could give us 20 times the speeds for a quarter of the price. I would think that the 50mb/s is a minimum amount of bandwidth we&#x27;d get, shouldn&#x27;t we still be able to get higher speeds despite them not being guaranteed? Or are we being capped at that 50mb mark? It seems like that 50mb/s minimum is our maximum, which seems a bit absurd. I&#x27;m not really sure if we&#x27;re being throttled at that bandwidth. 
 If spectrum doesn&#x27;t throttle dedicated lines at their guaranteed speeds, I suppose another cause may be the managed firewall that we have with them. It seems to be an older model, and from my knowledge it is performing tasks like Deep Packet Inspection. 
 We also use a shared building, with 2 other tenants in it. By paying for a dedicated line, would the other tenants in the building be using that line? From the agreement we signed, it looks like there are 3 address entries with the same address, so it seems plausible that we may not be getting that dedicated access, and that this may be a cost we should talk to the landlord about. 
 These are the theories I&#x27;ve come up with so far. I understand the value/cost associated with getting dedicated speeds, but it seems like we&#x27;re pretty much being limited at these speeds. Any help is appreciated!

                              <span>Cisco 4500X with multiple VLAN&#x27;s and I&#x27;ve added an additional VLAN to it and the traffic on this one specific VLAN needs to be limited to only this VLAN. How do I go about doing this? I&#x27;ve been looking at the Cisco on-line documentation and I&#x27;m not quite catching on to it.
 Traffic for these VLANS can interact and all. For the sake of this post, this traffic all occurs on 192.168.5.0 / 255.255.255.0
  
VLAN 1
 VLAN 2
 VLAN 3 and so on.
 
 Traffic for the special VLAN can interact and all. For the sake of this post, this traffic all occurs on 13.10.5.0 / 255.255.0.0. Any traffic in this network ID should be able to communicate only on this VLAN and outside (e.g. 192.168.5.0 cannot access this traffic).
  
VLAN 20 (Limited Traffic hidden from other VLAN&#x27;s)
 
 As it stands now I can hit the 13.10.5.0 traffic from 192.168.5.0 .

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 I am having an issue with my HP ProCurve 2510s, they are randomly shutting down the interfaces which go back to my router and the event log states that a loop was detected and the port was shut down, but im not sure where the loop actually is.
 This is my config:
 Checkpoint 1450 Appliance (Router &amp; FW)
 Multiple Port-Based VLANS, EG 10.0.70.0/24, 10.1.70.0/24 etc you get the idea. These are not tagged vlans. 
 Switch 1 (one dropping ports)
 The switch is configured to have untagged uplinks back to the checkpoint appliance. These links randomly drop for network loops being detected, but there is no logs on the checkpoint to suggest a network loop was detected either. The uplink to my other switch (100mbps half duplex) does not drop, but these are tagged vlans. No ports on the other 2510 drop either
 Each Port-Based vlan has its own IP (EG 10.0.70.1, 10.0.70.2 etc)
 im genuinely unsure where to look next in finding this network loop
 any help will be appreciated, i can share configs if required

The current router is a SonicWall TZ 105 which is incredibly outdated, I need to upgrade to something with the same security protections and better range (approximately 2,000 sq ft). I&#x27;m no expert but I did work in IT long ago, something that is simpler would be better.

                              <span>So IPSK was brought up in another thread here, and I just need to ask the people who have already implemented it..
 What happens with smartphones and tablets that promiscuously share wifi PSK-personal keys? Do they also attempt to share IPSK? 
 I see the Cisco implementation can tie it to a MAC address but these are also easily copied, so it seems like IPSK still has the potential to be widely shared and used by unauthorized devices.
 Probably a more important question is if there is some way for a wifi network to tell the clients, do not share our PSKs with other devices.

 I managed Sonicwall firewalls at my old job and honestly loved them. The Cisco Firepower’s that replaced them I did not care for haha. 
 My question for anyone with experience with both Sonicwall and PaloAlto - is there any reason to look at the SMB line from Palo Alto over Sonicwall? Advantages, ease of management, new/better features? From my experience the sonicwall were easy to manage and rarely had issues. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello,
 I have two edge SRX1500 firewalls, that I am replacing old cisco routers and firewalls with. My problem is just figuring out the failover situation during an ISP failover without using an edge switch or routers.
 Basically ISP1 would connect to the active SRX and ISP2 would connect to the passive SRX. My goal is to have it failover to the Passive SRX and ISP2, if ISP1 is down (i.e bgp down, link down etc...). I am thinking IP monitoring would be best for this situation. But I wanted to see if someone here has done something like this that maybe has a better way of doing it or if I am missing something?
 ​
 Other questions:
  
With an active/passive cluster, anything connected to the passive SRX never passes traffic, so presumably the BGP session with ISP2 would never come up until a failover occurs, correct? 
 With IP monitoring, if I wanted to fail back to ISP1 I presume that has to be done manually?

                              <span>Hi thanks for clicking.
 My issue is that I have a NAT map table setup but my IP routes are not following said map. Instead of the internal IP using the statically mapped external IP, it is using the &quot;dynamic NAT&quot;. There is no way to disable Dynamic NAT and it&#x27;s not even a range of IPs it a singular &quot;dynamic NAT&quot; IP. I believe this is the cause of said dynamic NAT IP being block listed since I am trying to send out newsletters. How can I get my IP routes to follow my NAT map properly?
 I&#x27;ve been one the phone with my ISP and they&#x27;ve told me they cannot disable this dynamic NAT and that they really don&#x27;t even have anymore control than I do.

                              <span>I want to configure WiFi Mesh for a small office. Where the number of devices usually stays around 150-200.
 (here, mesh &#x3D; wired mesh)
 I was checking a few mesh devices but all of them had this connection up to x number of devices.
 My question is, can we increase the number of devices that can be connected by increasing the number of APs in a mesh? (Assuming interference is not a problem)
 I checked Tp-link Deco XE75.
 Tp-link has written that it supports 200 devices but has not clarified that 200 in mesh or per AP.
 And if per AP, Does that mean 3AP &#x3D; 600 devices in mesh?
 Thank you.

                              <span>We have an app similar to TikTok, so the media being served is mainly videos. We are adding a CDN now to both, reduce the costs and make the loading faster (Google Cloud CDN), and are not sure how to configure it.
  
Cache static content vs Force cache all content. I think we will go with foce all content since we want all content to be cached.
 Client time to live: I see no reason to refresh the media ever. The videos cannot be changed by the users. Once uploaded they can just delete the post or keep it. So I see no reason to have such time to live at all. We would just set it to 1 year as that is the maximum time to select. Is that the right choice?
 Custom response headers and Negative Caching Policy: Do we need this at the beginning? Or should we just consider it later to further improve things?

                              <span>HI Team,
 Got kind of a weird question. 
 I got asked to configure some Juniper switches as a one time fee with certain QoS requirements. 
 I started making custom classifiers / queues but then after asking specific questions about what traffic was going to flow over this, the contacts response was &quot;it&#x27;s a standalone PA system. The only traffic going through it is PA traffic / multicast traffic, so just a single vlan&quot;
 He wants 4 different queues setup, each with a different DSCP ranking but...
 if the ONLY traffic is multicast traffic running on one vlan...what&#x27;s the point?

                              <span>Hey Team, I&#x27;ve been fighting with a Vendor who is putting all the blame on us for slowness - say&#x27;s it&#x27;s our network.
 Here are FACTS: (All tests done during off hours, no backups running)
 Location A &gt;&gt; IPsec VPN &gt;&gt; Location B
  
127Mbps TCP Upload
 156Mbps TCP Download
 635Mbps UDP Upload
 654Mbps UDP Download
  
Location A &gt;&gt; IPsec VPN &gt;&gt; Vendor&#x27;s Azure Instance
  
64Mbps TCP Upload
 284Mbps TCP Download
 420Mbps UDP Upload
 483Mbps UDP Download
  
Location B &gt;&gt; IPsec VPN &gt;&gt; Vendor&#x27;s Azure Instance (Same Instance)
  
326Mbps TCP Upload
 278Mbps TCP Download
 411Mbps UDP Upload
 461Mbps UDP Download
  
All traffic we pass to the vendor is TCP.
 Vendor says there is a problem on Office A&#x27;s Network.
 This is my argument - Office A (My main site) can pass 127Mbps of TCP Traffic to Office B (My remote site) over an IPsec VPN Tunnel. This should mean, at a minimum, I should be able to see at least 127Mbps of traffic from Office A, to the Vendors Azure Instance. I know our Router can pass at least 127Mbps, however we&#x27;re only able to pass 56Mbps to the vendor.
 The vendor says their Azure server is not setup with an active/active VPN, just failover. They&#x27;re stating there is no load balancers in place.
 What am I missing? This has to be some sort of routing issue between the ISP to Azure, or, some sort of bottleneck in the vendors Azure environment right?

                              <span>I had my Masters in Electrical and computer engineering. I was earlier interested in automation and robotics so I started working as a controls engineer. It is interesting working with CNCs, PLCs, and robots but I’m tired of working longer hours. With a job like this I either see longer hours, remote location or lots of travel. I’m unable to give my family much time as I’d like to. 
 I’m looking for something where I can also work from home. I had courses from networking in engineering and I’m fascinated so I started to learn a bit more for CCNA. I’m just worried I’ll have to start from scratch and will have to take a pay cut. I currently make between 90-100k. Is this a smart move or no? Can I make more pay once I get skilled in networking?

                              <span>Hello!
 I work for a small but quickly growing business that has a number of employees working partly or fully remote. The company has been upgrading all of the networking equipment for our relatively small on-premise server/domain, but I&#x27;m still running into issues with RDP accessed through the client VPN provided through a Cisco Meraki MX64 SD-WAN.
 The RDP/VPN connection seems to struggle mostly with video but it also sometimes drops for no real apparent reason. It&#x27;s out of my normal scope of work but I&#x27;ve been attempting to troubleshoot down to at least a general root cause.
 After doing quite a few pings/traceroutes/MTRs from the MX64 I&#x27;ve noticed that the ping to the local ISP node (50.46.181.20) seems to spike semi-regularly from very respectable numbers (1-10ms) to strangely much higher numbers (20-40ms). The connection can cope when I&#x27;m just doing office work but seems to push latency tests (performed via testmy.net/latency) on my local machine into the 200-300ms on certain video calls.
 I&#x27;m not hoping to pin down a specific cause with these tests, but would highly appreciate any insight into where I should look further.

                              <span>I have an expert level certification in WiFi and I was thinking about expanding my knowledge to include all things wireless, including CBRS. Federated Wireless has some relatively low cost certification courses: https://www.federatedwireless.com/services/certified-professional-installer/
 Has anyone taken this or any private LTE certification courses, and if so was it worth it in the end? I understand that it&#x27;s a loaded question and it depends on goals.
 My goals (to be transparent): add to resume, get a better job/higher salary

                              <span>Ok, so I&#x27;m kind of confused with Trunking ports. On some of my switches I have trunking ports where every VLAN is tagged, but somehow you you can access the management IP of the switch. The only time I have been able to access the management IP on switches (on other networks) is when I untag the management interface on the switch, but tag ever other vlan.
 ​
 Am I doing something wrong, is it bad to untag a vlan in a trunking port?
 ​
 ex:
 Trunk1
 Vlan1 Tagged
 Vlan2 Tagged
 Vlan3 Untagged

We will need to get the management platform for the PON vendor in order to provision, but can Solarwinds do any monitoring or statistic collection via MIB? Anyone successfully doing this and what PON vendor are you using (feel free to DM if you don&#x27;t want to publicly post)?

 We have Aruba 2540 in access layer and we are planning to buy few more but Aruba 2540 but they are EOL. I was reading about Arista that they have quite good hardware as switch. Anyone using similar model i.e. 48 port with 4SFP+ on Arista and can tell their experience and how much it cost roughly.
 Thanks for your input.

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to RDMA technology, and I&#x27;m confused by several rdma libraries. I cannot figure out the relationship among them. The libraries and kernel headers I&#x27;m confused with are as follows: 
 1.rdma-core/libibverbs
 2.rdma-core/librdmacm
 3.linux-5.4.2/include/rdma
 4.linux-5.4.2/iniclude/uapi/rdma
 My question is: 
 1.As far as I know. libibverbs provides the userspace applications with verbs api(i.e. functions with prefix ibv_), but it does not offer any connection-related functions, so applications need to exchange connection information using sockets(I see this operation in the libibverbs example rc_pingpong.c). librdmacm provides the user with easier connection management mechanism(e.g. rdma_get_cm_event). However, it seems that librdmacm does more work than connection management, since it also defines several apis(e.g. rdma_create_qp in rdma_cma.h) which looks similar to the ibv_function in libibverbs. So I do not know whether librdmacm is a superset of libibverbs? If not, what&#x27;s the relationship between them?
 2.In the example rc_pingpong.c of libibverbs, I cound see it includes the header file verbs.h, and it seems that linux-5.4.2/include/rdma and linux-5.4.2/iniclude/uapi do not play any role in the program(no heaer files in these two directories are included). So what are the header files in these two directories aimed at? 
 I have refer to several materials but have not made it clear. Any explanation or related resources are well-appreciated. Thanks!

 My question is, what is the best practice for management vlans? Do we tag the new management vlan or keep it untagged? If we use tagged management vlan, should the native vlan be a blackhole vlan?

 Can someone explain to me what the purpose of a &quot;Discard VLAN&quot; is and how it can help shape traffic in a network?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m setting up a lab in GNS3 to pilot enabling DHCP snooping and Dynamic ARP inspection. I got this setup and working properly with a Nexus 7k image, but it doesn&#x27;t support port channels and I want to setup my lab to mirror the real environment as closely as possible. I got the Nexus 9k 10.1.1 image from Cisco and have it all configured, but I can&#x27;t enable arp inspection because it says the ether-region needs to be set in TCAM. I&#x27;ve tried to do this but it throws an error. Trying to set any of the existing TCAM region entries to 0, saving the config, and rebooting results in no changes being made. There is a screenshot here - https://imgur.com/92E7B3a with more detail.
 Does anyone have any advice on how I can make this work?

                              <span>We are a large factory that in the past we have deployed multiple SSIDs for every service.. Eg AGVs have an ssid PDAs have an ssid, robots have an ssid...etc etc
 We have now run into the problem of to many SSIDs
 These SSIDs span over 2000 access points across the entire plant and we need them on every ap for roaming (I can&#x27;t profile down any further)
 From what I can see from other large deployments companies are moving towards a few SSIDs with a large capacity -- eg instead of 4 SSIDs with 2000 clients we would have 1 ssid and call it &quot;Manufacturing&quot; and create a /20 network for it.. this also allows us to add more vlans to the blank group if we ever need to expand its size.
 We might also create 2 SSIDs 1 with FT and another with just adaptive.
 What are you large wireless folks doing.. looking for advice and reasons why to go one way over another

                              <span>Recently just got done with a refresh: new AP installs, moving APs, etc. We&#x27;re just about done so basically I&#x27;ve cleaned up the APs that are showing &quot;down&quot; on the MM gui. We&#x27;re talking 100+ or so of them. This was done about a week or so ago. Monday, while i was checking my MM a bunch of the (down) APs popped up again on the MM. Minor nuisance really, as my APs in prod are working fine, but it&#x27;s just weird that some came back. A lot of them had partial names to them too: e.g. an AP labelled &quot;A-102&quot; showed up as &quot;A-10&quot;, etc. 
 ​
 Any idea what happened here? The only thing i can think of that changed was our Solarwinds alerting was enabled after the deployment was done. It wouldn&#x27;t make sense since that&#x27;s on the SW side.

 I would like to send only specific syslog messages from Cisco IOS switches to Splunk, for example login attempts or configuration changes. I couldn&#x27;t find any outboud syslog filter option.
 Anyone knows a solution for this?

                              <span>Hello,
 ​
 I currently have a MAN with ~20 sites interconnected with dark fibers, in a sort of a ring topology, plus a dozen WAN sites. All these sites are l2 connected (even WAN sites with metro-ethernet) so I have sometimes typical l2 issues (broadcast storm, stp misconfig...). To overcome these problems, I am thinking of doing a redesign of this network with consultants but before meeting them, I would like your views on what are the current technologies used for this type of network and what are the pro/cons.
 My needs: 
 - L3VPN but also sometimes L2VPN for legacy applications, 
 - the simpler solution the best from an exploitation point of view, 
 - ideally throughtput between sites should be 40+/50+ Gbps
 - and stable (but does it really need to be specified :-)
 I did some research, there seems to be 3 main technologies for this type of network: evpn/vxlan, traditional mpls, and sr mpls which seems to be the &quot;new simplified&quot; mpls (perhaps i overlooked some). From a budget standpoint, the evpn/vxlan solution seems cheaper because available on switchs, and mpls seems to be available only on router hardware which could be expensive if i need to go for 50+ Gbps interfaces.
 ​
 Thank you for your help.
 Regards

                              <span>Hello,
 We are used to have dedicated management interfaces on network devices. As more and more functions/features are hosted on x86 devices, it&#x27;s natural to implement the same management mechanism.
 To avoid mixing management and data planes, multiple routing tables have to be implemented. There are, from my understanding, three ways to do it :
 - namespace
 - table + ip rule from/to
 - vrf (added to linux kernel thanks to cumulus)
 Excluding namespaces which are too heavy for this need, what could differenciate the two last propositions?
 I can feel that vrf have a stronger implementation/traffic isolation but it seems that the result are approximately the same ?
 Thank you,
 Romain

                              <span>Hi guys, been working on improving our Aruba wireless set up and one thing I have noticed is we have client devices endlessly trying to auth with bad credentials (mostly missing the domain in their username) or clients who are locked out in AD constantly trying to connect. I was wondering if there was any benefit to blacklisting these clients after repeated failed auth for a period of time? Am I right to think this would free up some AP capacity as they will ignore that client for the duration of the blacklisting meaning less resources are wasted on talking to a client that is failing auth. Any other suggestions on how to improve welcome. Thanks.

 Does anyone know if its possible to edit an XML based on the result of an if else statement? Take this section of my script for example. It uses netmiko and run against iosxe......
 Output&#x3D; net_connect.send_command(&#x27;show run&#x27;) if &quot;logging buffered&quot; in Output: print (&quot;logging buffered is configured&quot;) else: print (&quot;logging buffered is not configured&quot;) 
 Based on that result, I want to edit part of an XML file that says....
 Text 
 I would like to change the &quot;text&quot; part to something else based on the result of the if else statement. Is something like that possible?
 I want to also mention that there will be multiple sections on the XML document that I would like to change with one script.

                              <span>I have an Intel XL710 network card running on Debian 10, cpu is AMD EPYC 7402P (24-Core). Network card has 24 rx/tx queues, one for each core, but the first queue gets a lot more packets on tx (about twice as more) than the other queues (which are pretty much equivalent). Because of this, the core to which the interrupts of this queue are assigned is much more loaded. What could be the cause of this situation?

                              <span>Cisco devices in MNC&#x27;s (where you have to copy images over WAN links) , are you still using tftp/sftp or utilizing any API ? Pushing via Ansible or others? 
 We have Catalysts and Nexus and FTD&#x27;s, and using tftp/sftp seems slow when you have other devices with a nice GUI that says &quot;upload file/image&quot;.

                              <span>I&#x27;m doing some clever (stupid?) routing between leaf (bgp, L3 fabric) and openstack (software routing in overlays).
 I got to the point, when I have two (or more) routes, and only one is valid (i.e. can deliver traffic to the consumer). The difference between them is that in one case there is active nexthop IP, and in other there is none. Nexthop is connected through a bridge, therefore it&#x27;s impossible to use link state to check if nexthop is available or not. The single way is to check if it can be resolved via arp.
 There are other ways to solve my problem (healthchecks, hooks into openstack code, etc), but I wanted to investigate feasibility of the nexthop &#x27;resolving&#x27; (in this context, resolving of IP into MAC, i.e. arp). Are there the name of this technique? Is someone using it?
 Basically, I have a route:
  x.x.x.0/24 via y.y.y.y dev foobar 
 And this route should only be taken in account when y.y.y.y can be seen as a neighbor in ip neighbors, and ignored, if not.
 I use bird for bgp, so it&#x27;s either bird feature (check nexthop resolvability), or linux routing feature.
 Is this a thing, or should I try other ways?

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m currently looking for console server data solution for mainly Cisco devices. What do you think about out of band (SIM CARD or wifi based(?) ) console servers - theoretically sounds very good - how about the practice ?
 Also there&#x27;re some other requirements we would like to have:
  
minimum of 16 interfaces
 possibility to use RJ45 to RJ45 UTP cables for simplicity and longer range cross-rack connectivity (than simple Cisco console cables).
 Continuing from 2 - the device should be able to rollover programmatically that cable (also - how this function is called - (software selectable pins) ?). Because manually changing pins from straight through to rollover in UTP cable from standard is not very sustainable solution. In Ethernet world similar thing is called auto-mdix - it&#x27;s interesting how this thing is called in serial world :)
  
Any suggestions ? Thanks

                              <span>Was stopped by an accountant and higher up today, to talk about implementing A second isp(AT&amp;T) to our network and trying to trunk them together. I asked why his reasoning was because our current isp (spectrum) gets capped at 600/ upload &amp; /600down and he wants the full gigabit from At&amp;T fiber internet. I asked why not just drop spectrum and go full AT&amp;T he explained he saw an article in 2020 saying companies should have isp redundancy in case of outages. I don’t see how this wouldn’t do anything but cause a potential headache trying to trunk and manage seperate isps. Any thoughts on this?

                              <span>Hello All,
 Just want to get ideas and best practices to achieve this. Essentially in the case that there are multiple branches and each branch has to pay/communicate with a vendors etc.
 Management wants to say create a PayPal account per branch. Is it best to create an entire new email for the branch specifically for this service. Branch already has an email ex: &quot; [branch01@xyz.com](mailto:branch01@xyz.com) &quot;
 My idea is to create a DL as [&quot;pp-branch01@xyz.com](mailto:&quot;pp-branch01@xyz.com)&quot; and set its users ( managment) to view these emails and request as apposed to using the &quot; [branch01@xyz.com](mailto:branch01@xyz.com)&quot; .
 I know a drawback is that DL wont have a stored location compared to a mailbox but I feel like creating 2 emails is unnecessary. 
 Using a DL will also avoid the branch email reading the PayPal email not intended for them or even delete it.
 Im all ears to know how your org handles this, thank you!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been applying for jobs lately. At least a few of them now send an email saying &quot;are you still interested&quot;, then when I say &quot;yes&quot; they randomly send an aptitude test that they say needs to be returned in 90 minutes. I&#x27;ve yet to actually do this, it strikes me as wrong and out of order.
 Others ask me to take tests that attempt to identify how I think, solve problems, get along with others, ECT. These I can sympathize with a little more, but they always ask you to take them after talking to the hiring person, not anyone that knows a ton about the job
 Am I way off base here? I think they&#x27;re just looking to weed out applicants...

                              <span>For context, I look after the health and overall functionality of the Windows endpoints at my organization.
 Just came out of a long ass meeting with this guy (Bob), and every department manager under the sun. Bob was trying to throw me under the bus because his software installed on half of our endpoints couldn’t report back to the management console for 6 months now. He&#x27;s saying how my environment is trash, that I botched the deployment, that I didn&#x27;t go to him to test, blah blah blah...
 Rewind 6 months.. Bob reached out to me asking for help because suddenly nothing is reporting back to the console. I was running a project at the time, so I didn&#x27;t have a lot of time to do a deep dive but a quick look was showing that the proxy is blocking the software from contacting the console. I sent an email saying just that and that he would need to log a ticket to the security team to get the sorted.
 I guess he didn&#x27;t do that, now everything is urgent and it&#x27;s my fault. Everyone is starting to side with Bob then having a go at me. So, I pull one of my contacts from security into the meeting, asked him to whitelist the URLs used by the software, and voila! Suddenly it&#x27;s working. WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT BOB?
 In my livid state, I dug up that email I sent and forwarded to everyone in that meeting, then left meeting abruptly.

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 Our main corporate location has been suffering from a rather annoying issue for almost a year now. We have a 600 user office in the midwestern United States. The trouble is, Google is classifying our public IP addresses as being in Brazil. This is rather annoying for our users, as search results return the Brazilian versions of websites as well as the search results appearing in Portuguese.
 We can easily switch the search results to English, but the Brazilian websites still appear as first results.
 Normally you can enable the browser to detect your location (probably also through public IP), however we have an Edge group policy disabling this. We are unable to enable this due to security concerns (even though every website can view our public IP anyways).
 Ultimately it looks like the issue is an incorrect location mapping in Google’s geo-cache. I have submitted multiple automated requests to get this updated (using this: https://support.google.com/websearch/workflow/9308722?hl&#x3D;en). However after around 50 submissions over various months, nothing has changed.
 We are a full Microsoft shop with no Google products (so no line of sight to any direct Google support). Looking up our public IP’s using ARIN show the correct address information. Other browser and IP based location services also correctly identify our location.
 Has anyone ever ran into this issue or have any ideas on how to remediate it? I know it’s nothing on our computers because Google correctly identifies the IP location of our remote users and all of our other offices. Unfortunately it is this one office with the issue.

 EDIT: My Environment is large enough that we may different kinds of climates, requirements and goals in many different situations with varying budgets. We have a few vendors but, not all needs are for servers. I&#x27;m not so sure that they care either.
 That said, its nice to know whats out there and what people are using and what their projects are.
 For example i didn&#x27;t know Eaton had Lithium based Batteries in their UPS line. I happen to know if not over charged Lithium Ion can last notably longer than lead acid, and Lithium Iron Phosphate Far longer than Lithium Ion. So the idea of Lithium based Units is quite interesting!

                              <span>Trying to sort out how to get a fresh start; I -literally- have 700+ tickets in the queue right now.
 We use an ITIL based system so some tickets are termination requests where they were properly termed, just not archived yet. Those I&#x27;m not too worried about (actually looks to be about 100 of them)
 But how do you handle 100s of incidents/break-fixes? Sometimes getting answers from people are pulling teeth with tweezers. Sometimes its a legit issue but there&#x27;s just no good fix at the moment. I&#x27;d love to get this under control. I&#x27;ve added rules and tweaked the logic on the ticket system to require people to reply to tickets if I&#x27;ve replied to them (7 days from my reply, ticket automatically closed).

                              <span>Recently got a cold call from a _seemingly_ legit company that is in the security space. Went something like this:
 [My cell phone rings - personal phone, but I also use it for business]Some Guy: Hi! I work for [company]. I got your info from LinkedIn [NOTE: my LinkedIn profile DOES NOT include my phone number at all] and I was wondering if you have a few minutes to talk about what tools you&#x27;re currently using to secure your cloud infrastructure?
 Me: [context-switching and baffled] I can&#x27;t talk now.
 SG: When can I give you a call later?
 Me: You can&#x27;t.
 [CLICK, END]
 Listen, I&#x27;m not sure who needs to hear this, but if you are in sales and your job description includes a part where basically you need to cold call companies and try to social engineer their tech people, then I need to inform you that you, your job, the company you work for, or some combination of all three, truly suck and you should feel ashamed of yourself.
 If, however, you are actually a Black Hat, then.... you&#x27;re doing a bang-up job! Keep going with your bad self!

 I THINK Google fixed that. Now I&#x27;m dealing LBS causing 100% CPU spikes.
 I can&#x27;t wait to ditch Chrome.

                              <span>Classic story of an app failing and everyone pointing fingers at everyone else. Finally, we are on a call about it and someone figures it out (shit code + DB issue). Anyway, an engineer accidently gave us our new team motto after he fixed it...
 &quot;It should not happen again, but it should not have happened in the first place either.&quot;
 If that doesn&#x27;t describe the garbage we deal with, i don&#x27;t know what does.
 Edit - it broke again

                              <span>I recently have been working on moving our org to a security-key based MFA solution considering the various attacks against more traditional push, SMS, call, or TOTP MFA solutions. 
 As part of this process, I started looking at the various avenues of attack that could bypass FIDO/FIDO2/U2F MFA style authentication. Previously I would use something like EvilGoPhish to phish employees/customers and steal their session cookies to bypass MFA but this does not work with U2F.
 Then I came across an article that mentioned using WebUSB to defeat YubiKey and of course where one attack exists, other attacks also exist.
 The important quote from this entire article.
  
&quot;Vervier and Orrù found that they could code a website to connect to the Yubikey Neo with that WebUSB feature, instead of with the usual Chrome API for U2F that it&#x27;s designed to use. In doing so, they could circumvent the checks that the browser performs before querying the Yubikey—the checks that confirm that websites are the ones they claimed to be.&quot; 
  
Thankfully STIG has descriptions of how to disable both WebUSB and its sister technology WebBluetooth.
  
Disable WebUSB
 Disable WebBluetooth
 
 TL;DR WebUSB can be used for novel attacks to attack local security keys and bypass MFA.

I made a feedback form for laptop issues and got response that 1 of 2 employees in the firm have &quot;laptop slow&quot; issues. We have only i5/i7 laptops. Most users face a CPU 100% usage at the startup. And others have problems when connecting to 2 4k monitors through docks that the laptops then become too slow. Where should I start fixing the slow laptop issues?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had a fun afternoon. User was concerned that email were not reaching them. Everything was fine in Mimecast, dug a little deeper. It appears from message trace in Exchange Online, that one person on a distribution list (used for enquiries are sent from their website) are having them sent straight to their Junk Folder. 
 I&#x27;ve asked them to mark the domain as safe, but they are still being delivered to junk. I&#x27;ve looked in PowerShell using the get-inbox rule to see if they&#x27;ve set anything, but it gets no results. 
 It seems odd behavior that an internal email address would marked as junk for one user. Has anyone else seen this problem?

                              <span>So in my IT shop the security teams seems to run everything, and make all the decisions. The security team is not super tech savvy to put it nicely , but will just log into server and make changes not knowing what they are doing. An example it logging into Windows servers and stop/disabling the firewall service. They seem to be making all the decisions for the enterprise environment, software to use or not use. I am not talking like we will not allow some software because we see it as a security issue which is actually their job, but like running the evaluation of major software like Okta (which i like by the way) then buying it and forcing it on the rest of IT without their testing or input. They seem to spec out the hardware not just say ever device needs to be from proper sources and have TPM etc. But they have no idea about hardware or how it works. They are opposed to anything open source which kills me. I am very cautious about open source, but sometimes it just is needed. To many example for non open source vendors with huge security issues that they don&#x27;t fix or disclose. Security by obscurity. They love to hold everyone&#x27;s feet to the fire about change control but do impacting things without using the change board, nor notifying the impacted persons. Like someday getting an e-mail from the application that your admin privileges are gone without any notice. CIO seems to be ok with this. Like cyber is doing all the work on the move the cloud? 
 This all seems really backwards for me, but I need perspective. My idea of security it to set policy, weigh in on enforcement changes, set infrastructure goals for the actual sysadmins to move toward a more secure posture, deal with incidents, and stuff like that. Not hands on doing IT&#x27;s job.

                              <span>Hello all - Our org wil be making a decision to consolidate some dated hardware next year and we are on the hunt for a decent HCI solution to host our VMware cluster which is currently running 3 tier on UCS for compute, cisco FIs and nexus for network, and Pure for Storage.
 I&#x27;m a past Nutanix customer and had nothing but good experiences with those appliances, but for whatever reason our higher ups dislike the name and brand because our past appliances were &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;clunky&quot; and didn&#x27;t seem interested in hearing about how we were past due for refreshes as we were one of the early adopters of nutanix back in 2013 and were still running essentially 8 year old gear. its a bit of a long and complicated story, but we had to gut all our nutanix stuff after covid budget cuts happened, So i just have a feeling Nutanix wont be considered.
 the other 2 contenders we are looking at are Dell vxrail and HPE dHCI. I&#x27;d like to ask which of these 2 would you go with if you had a choice? or if there is something different all together you&#x27;d recommend? the VM cluster is very overprovisioned for what we have, so this will be a bit of a rightsizing attempt based on current workloads. consuming about 40-50GHz of CPU at rest, 500GB of Memory, and about 15TB of storage. a full flash solution would be my preference to keep our IOPS performance equivalent to Pure. Cloud is not an option at this point

                              <span>Looks like aws is doing something funky with ICMP requests from a container running on an EC2 host to a host on the internet. Pinging internal IP addresses doesn&#x27;t have the same issue. We even reduced the frequency to 1 ICMP per 10 sec and still after a while they seem to be blocked. 
 Is there anything we can do or is it an AWS thing?

                              <span>So for some context, I&#x27;ve been at my first IT job for a little over a year now. I work at an auto group that has 3 dealerships of which the only IT is my boss and me. 
 Despite my many efforts to use a ticketing system, they say &quot;we have tried in the past but it just doesn&#x27;t work&quot; we have a Microsoft to-do list because according to them it&#x27;s essentially the same thing. This leads me to often get either in trouble or my wrist slapped because I&#x27;m &quot;working on things that are not important&quot; and it leads me to get calls from my boss regularly, or when I have all my obvious projects done for the day I get the &quot;What are you doing right now&quot; which sometimes is &quot;Nothing&quot; which is never a good answer but its an honest one. 
 I&#x27;ve just been so frustrated, especially since the pay is $4 an hour less than my best friend who does very similar work 10 minutes away. it Doesn&#x27;t help that my boss seems bipolar half the time, I am 21, and he is around 24 so we will often talk about girls, cars, etc. but a lot of the time I feel treated like a dog, it&#x27;s like he treats me like I don&#x27;t know anything and will talk down to me and just generally treats me bad. 
 I&#x27;m really conflicted, I overall like it here, and I&#x27;ve only been here a year but it&#x27;s becoming so much more often that I think &quot;I could just leave right here and now&quot;

                              <span>Some users reporting issues with delays in camera feeds, devices not working until rebooting etc.
 I noticed yesterday my teams seemed to update to a newer version, more rounded windows, larger drop shadows, slightly different fonts/aliasing. It was buggy AF. Multiple attempts to start, hanging on the Teams Splash screen, Unable to log in. Delays in starting video calls.
 Today... that update is gone and I&#x27;m back on the older version. I don&#x27;t know if this is Microsoft backpedaling or just something weird with my machine.
 Anyone else noticing the changes and/or experience user calls? 
 More info: the latest version for windows - October 12th presents a significant update to the Electron Framework. from 10.x to 16.x Likely the cause of the issues/bugs, because you know, Microsoft likes to QA/Beta Test on customers now.

                              <span>I know the first answer everyone&#x27;s going to want to post is JAMF, but my current Mac presence is not that strong, and there are plans to stop issuing Macs altogether, but for the time being I&#x27;m trying to come up with a solution that doesn&#x27;t involve a new service, with yet another set of licensing.
 I&#x27;ve been configuring an Intune environment, which is working fine for Windows/Autopilot, however I do see there are MacOS options. I&#x27;m wondering how useful this is, to those of you that have worked with Mac in Intune.
 I&#x27;m assuming autopilot is out of the question, and our help desk will still need to do some manual stuff, but I&#x27;m hoping some could shed light on a few questions:
  
Is there an OS deployment function for MacOS, similar to Autopilot?
 These are just going for be for a full AzureAD environment, not hybrid. Does that make a difference?
 The laptop will need a local user account created, right?
 Can we register all of the Macs to a single Apple ID, in the event of a user forgetting their password or something?
 Is a local admin account possible, if so, doable through Intune?
 Lastly, any recommendations for remote control software. I&#x27;ve used ManageEngine, TeamViewer, Dameware in the past. Not sure Dameware is even a thing anymore, TeamViewer might be possible but looking for what you guys have found to be most efficient.

 https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/14/microsoft_office_365_message_encryption/
 Apparently, OME is using ECB encryption which seems to be not much of a step above message obfuscation instead of being a secure encryption method.
 So, if you have a requirement to send secure email, OME is not meeting that requirement.

I want to utilize an 8 port switch with this setup. How could I use a Unifi AC AP Pro to receive the wifi signal from the Satellite? My theory is if it can do that, I could trunk it to a dummy switch and have it power my trailer. Help? Anyone?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 We have a product which sends out system notifications to our customers Sysadmins etc. We use SendGrid to send these emails (which works like a charm BTW).
 However - several of our customers are asking if we can send the e-mail from their domain (so that the FROM field would be [&quot;someone@customerdomain.com](mailto:&quot;@customerdomain.com)&quot;.
 I&#x27;ve looked into the whole authenticated domain setup in SendGrid (which we went through ourselves) - and this seems like the correct approach. However: 
 1) What would the most &quot;correct&quot; approach be? Should we create a subuser and then authenticate domains for each of our customers on this subuser? Sending our customers the SPF record etc. generated by SendGrid.
 2) We&#x27;re not all that interested in doing this manually every time a customer asks. Does anyone have experience with using the SendGrid API for authenticating domains? 
 I&#x27;m a developer (not a Sysadmin), so I&#x27;m a bit worried to mess something up. Basically we just want to use our SendGrid account to send emails from different domains (approved by the owners of the domains).
 Could anyone walk me through the correct way to do this?
 I&#x27;ve tried reaching out to SendGrid support, but they just keep sending me to the same &quot;How authenticated domains work&quot;-article, which doesn&#x27;t explain the scenario I&#x27;m interested in. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated! :)

 Can anyone ELI5 if running RustDesk to just connect from my main PC to my virtual machine on my iPad Pro is safe?

                              <span>We have a handful of machines, different models, at different locations, on different domains, that have been running into an issue where after they reboot their machine, it will not load https web pages, on any browser, unless the nic is disabled then re-enabled. I ran a Wireshark capture on one of the machines exhibiting this behavior consistently and it showed that the machine was communicating with the website but the page continues to spin. I don&#x27;t see anything different in the communication either before or after the nic disabling except that the browser loads. I see no certificate failures and that is not something showing as the issue on the browser. It also happens if the page is internal to our company or external. We have had the desktop tech update the nic drivers but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the cause. We have had the proxy server bypassed for the testing machine. I have not had the anti-virus turned off yet because I don&#x27;t see any failures communicating with the server in the Wireshark capture.
 Has anyone ever seen this?

                              <span>Article: https://venturebeat.com/data-infrastructure/report-81-of-it-teams-directed-to-reduce-or-halt-cloud-spending-by-c-suite/
  
According to a new study from Wanclouds, 81% of IT leaders say their C-suite has directed them to reduce or take on no additional cloud spending as costs skyrocket and market headwinds worsen. After multiple years of unimpeded cloud growth, the findings suggest enterprises’ soaring cloud spending may tempered as talks of a looming downturn heat up.
 As organizations move forward with digital transformations they set out on at the beginning of the pandemic, multicloud usage is becoming increasingly unwieldy, and costs are difficult to manage across hybrid environments.
 Furthermore, a wrench has been thrown into IT teams’ plans over the last two quarters in the form of the market tumult. Rising inflation and interest rates, along with fears of a potential recession have put increasing financial and operational strain on organizations. As a result, many companies are reevaluating their digital ambitions as cloud spending is brought under the microscope.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Since about a year, Microsoft refuses to offer us support through Teams-calls and instead only wants to reach out by phone. For us, having calls over the phone instead of Teams is quite inconvenient as we prefer having multiple team-members on the support call at the same time. Of course, it&#x27;s possible to have multi-person phone calls, but it&#x27;s obviously not as optimized as Teams. Also, scheduling Teams-meetings through the calendar in Outlook (which we used to do) instead of &#x27;verbally&#x27; by mail brings the added benefit of not having to miss calls because the support-engineer mixed up his timezones. Finally, sharing single screens through Teams is better than being forced to share your entire desktop through Quick Assist.
 Does anybody know why they do this? When we ask, they avoid the question. For us, it&#x27;s both inconvenient, irritating and strange, because it looks like they deem Teams to be an unsafe way of communicating. Before this, I generally had great experiences with MS Support, but this is just really annoying.

                              <span>I have been in IT for over 20 years. 3 degrees, too many certs to name and countless hours studying, just to stay ahead of the tech. 
 I&#x27;m burned out. The company I work for is a tech company that does business with many other companies that make high end computers and other electronics. I&#x27;ve been here 15 years and I&#x27;m about to call it quits.
 I own a company that does apartments and storage rentals and it is way less stressful. Sure you have to deal with tenants, but you don&#x27;t have another IT department making you use their systems just to do business with them. 
 My other company won&#x27;t really support me right now. The only way it would support me would be to raise rent across the board and cut back on maintenance etc. I don&#x27;t want to be that way. I am trying to keep my places clean and affordable. 
 This is probably just a rant, but damn it I hate coming in to work EVERY DAMN DAY.

                              <span>Hello!
 Here&#x27;s the deal:
  
There is an office with two floors, each with a different type of user. Type &quot;A&quot; use the Windows keyboard layout &quot;X&quot; and type &quot;B&quot; use the Windows keyboard layout &quot;Y&quot;.
 Each floor has its own VLAN and DHCP server.
 Computers may be arbitrarily moved between floors, so the same computer may be used by both user types.
 All computers and users are domain joined. All computers are in the same OU. &quot;A&quot; type users are in the &quot;A&quot; OU and &quot;B&quot; type users are in the &quot;B&quot; OU.
 Each computer has a hypervisor running a Windows VM. Every time a computer is shut down, the VM goes back to its original state.
 All computers shut down automatically at 21:00 and turn on automatically at 07:00.
  
How would you ensure user type &quot;A&quot; has the Windows keyboard layout &quot;X&quot; preconfigured on the Windows logon screen?
 How would you ensure user type &quot;B&quot; has the Windows keyboard layout &quot;Y&quot; preconfigured on the Windows logon screen?
 Thanks in advance!
 Edit: I have tried with a powershell computer startup script that changes the relevant registry values depending on the Windows VM gateway, but it doesn&#x27;t work (it works if executed manually after user login, so it&#x27;s not a scripting issue), maybe because when the script is executed Windows doesn&#x27;t have a gateway yet?
 Here&#x27;s the part of the script I used to get the gateway:
  
$ip &#x3D; Get-NetIPConfiguration | Foreach IPv4DefaultGateway | Select-Object NextHop
 $gateway &#x3D; $ip.NextHop.ToString()
  
Going passwordless is my last resort!

                              <span>Hello fellow geeks! I need some suggestions for my application.
 I have a server and I need to read around 200files per second, they are image TIFF sequences and the size per file can be from 100kps to 3megas. I need to read this files in Real Time and it works but after a while (30seconds) the read times slow down a bit as the drives/bandwidth has reached the limit and needs more time to deliver the files.
 I currently have a server grade NVME PCI gen 3 raid controller (don&#x27;t have the server in hand) and it handles 8nvmes. I have it set for Raid 0 but maybe on my specific case could Raid 1 be more beneficial?
 The reason I&#x27;m wondering this that if the controller asks for a single 100kps file to 8 diferent drives and needs to wait for all 8 to provide the data before it can proceed to the next file and it needs to do this 200 times a second maybe on Raid 1 2 drives have the same file and could potentially provide a more consistent random access performance?
 This is very specific and um trying to get some more knowledge. Thanks in advance

                              <span>We are currently looking at the possibility of installing Windows Hello for Business across our organisation. However, for security reasons, we would like to force users to type their password in at least once week, instead of a PIN or using their face/biometrics. This will mean that they will have to type their long passwords and the system would block them from using any other sign-in method in particular instance.
 We plan to roll out Windows Hello for Business via Intune.
 Is this possible to do and if so, how can we go about doing it?

                              <span>We planning to migrate the CA within the same domain. The Old Certificate Authority (Legacy Cryptographic Provider) has permission to issue the Old smartcard logon v3 certificate template. The new Certificate Authority (Crypto Next Generation) has permission to issue the New smartcard logon v4 certificate template (both templates are configured the same except for the cryptography tab). The most interesting customization in the templates below:
 In both templates, the following parameters are configured in the Issuance Requirements tab:
 This number of authorized signatures 1
 application policy
 Certificate Request Agent
 Valid existing certificate
 We have a lot of users using smart cards to logon, to reduce the load on our help desk (enrollment agent) we want to use the Supersedence template. So that our users can reissue certificates on their own / autoenrollment. To do this, use the criterion in the Issuance Requirements tab: Valid existing certificate
 In the New smart card logon certificate template, the Supersedens template tab contains the Old smartcard logon certificate template, certificate templates are replaced correctly with us.
 The question is:
 The user receives a request to renew/autoenroll the certificate in tray OS balloon, the user sees the required template that has been replaced ( New smartcard logon ), but when continuing to work with the certificate issuance wizard, the user is requested to sign the enrollment agent.
 Tell me, is this because the certificate issued by the Old smartcard logon template does not fall under the Valid existing certificate flag for the New smartcard logon template certificate?
 Do I understand correctly that this will not work without an enrollment agent in such a configuration?
 We cannot refuse to use the enrollment agent, we must control new users and issue a certificate for them.
 Thank you for help.

                              <span>Been working with this MNC company who I shall not named for more than a year now. Basically my role is to take care of a POC environment AKA lab manager for their pre &amp; post sales engineers to deploy their respective solutions for demo to their potential customers. The problem is, I have no idea what&#x27;s going on with my lab and my reporting manager then was too busy to entertain my inquiry, most of the time they outright ignore me.
 After a year for some reason I&#x27;ve been assigned to a new reporting manager who happens to be the principal SA for the lab. Met them privately to discuss my dissatisfaction and what I really want for years to come. In the end they promised to get me involved more in whatever pertaining to the lab and to be frank, I don&#x27;t buy it. I was right though because so far it&#x27;s same shit just different person.
 This really demotivates me as I believe what they&#x27;re doing devalues me as an experienced engineer for 7 years not to mention the jobscope that they promised during the hiring is far from the reality. I&#x27;m more than just that guy who holds CMDB for the lab and gives &quot;consultation&quot; to presales engineers every single day. Been thinking of jumping ship so far not landing any gig.

                              <span>We disable the built in administrator account and create a new local admin account called RAccess during the build process. When testing LAPS, we have set the name of the administrator account to manage to be RAccess, and were expecting to see the LAPS password applied to that account. What is happening is that the disabled built in administrator account is being re-enabled, renamed to RAccess2 and the LAPS password is being applied to that account. We&#x27;re rolling out the client via SCCM, and have tried installing it both before and after adding the devices to an OU with LAPS set up. Any ideas where to go next would be appreciated. Everything that I have read suggests that LAPS will not create, enable or rename accounts. We can recover the LAPS password OK, so it looks as all Schema and OU setup has been done correctly.

                              <span>One user missed an important email from CEO. The email was found in her Junk mail folder. I ran the email trace and it shows the email was delivered to her Inbox. I also found the spam confidence level was -1, and I saw on the Analyzer destination (Dest): &quot;I&quot; which means that the message was sent to the Inbox and not Junk &quot;J&quot;. I also checked her Outlook rules and Junk folder block sender settings, but didn&#x27;t find anything that will put the email to the Junk mail folder. I suspect she inadvertently drag/drop the email to Junk mail folder, but I can&#x27;t prove it. I don&#x27;t have Office 365 E5 license to let me check the audit log. The user insisted the email went to her Junk mail folder and requested to find out why the email was put there. She refused to accept my suggestion to monitor if the issue happens again. If you were me, how will you reply her?
 By the way, she is our HR benefit person, I may need her help in the future, so don&#x27;t want to make her upset. 
 Please advise!

                              <span>Hi all 
 I know I have low Karma, but have been on reddit for quite some time, hope this is the best sub to ask help with (and actually lets me start replying to other subs without complaining my Karma is too low)
 Anyway, I have asked google countless times and my first go-to is reddit for issue like this, but all the fixes I have found for others do not seem to work.
 Trying to log a ticket with MS too, but seems we don&#x27;t have support credits, considering what we spend per month, but will try and use another service to jump off.
 Issue:
 We had an Exchange 2010 server in full Hybrid running fine, all mailboxes were migrated to 365 a few years ago and we could use the on prem 2010 box&#x27;s to relay to 365 for printers etc.
 The main purpose keeping the on prem is for mailbox creation then mi…</span>

                              <span>I’ve been running the numbers and for a small organization with a file, app, and SQL server doing a fairly nominal amount of processing, Azure seems to make financial sense when looking at on-prem alternatives (physical host running ESXi or HyperV). Are any of you migrating existing environments totally to Azure at this point? Especially given the uncertainty of VMware licensing with Broadcom, I’m thinking this might be the last big wave of on-prem for SMBs. Am I missing anything on the horizon?

                              <span>Enterprise IT sysadmins: is there a case to be made for a hard copy user manual / handbook that would be updated and re-printed periodically (say, twice a year) and then physically distributed to end-users? This would be instead of maintaining a user-facing wiki, SharePoint site, BookStack, etc... We would keep using our internal admin-facing Confluence, of course.
 It would be a lot of work and not something that I would find particularly enjoyable. Furthermore, it almost seems like admitting defeat: our stuff is so complicated, evidently, that you need a book to understand it!
 But there are a few factors which lead me to believe that it could maybe make sense:

Would you figure it out before it&#x27;s too late, as a total outsider? You could get datacenter access of course, just no ideas on accounts/credentials. Let&#x27;s say, a mishmash of 300 servers (mostly VMs, Server 2012 R2 or Server 2019), 1500 workstations (mostly W10), up to 300 users on VDI, and 2000 employees total.
 Are there reasonably-priced outside services that specialize in recovering in such situations to save a company that accidentally their SysAdmins?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 A bit of background - I&#x27;m helping out a small tax office that has two sites. Site one has 5 desktops and the other has 2. 
 Site one has a Synology Nas Active Directory environment. 
 Site two the users have an account on each pc. 
 They want to be able to share files between the two sites and use roaming profiles.
 I don&#x27;t like the Synology and would like them on a windows environment. 
 I&#x27;m use to supporting a large corporate IT environment. So the solutions that I&#x27;m use to just don&#x27;t make business sense to a Small office. 
 If one of you can prescribe us a setup that would be awesome!
 A traditional option and a cloud hybrid option.
 Thank you for reading :D

                              <span>So, I&#x27;ve been looking for a different job in my town, IT jobs don&#x27;t come up often around here. One becomes available, i am MORE than qualified but because i&#x27;m a weird f--ker, I was rejected for the job. Alright, I&#x27;ll move on.. A week later (Today) a head hunting company contacts me on indeed about a job &quot;i would be PERFECT for&quot;.. Guess which job it was for.. Yep, the one that rejected me. I told them they rejected me and they asked if I want to apply anyways I told em &quot;Screw it, Go for it lets see what happens&quot;. Thats when I get another email about a job in my town from a different head hunter company, and then another, and another, and another. So far 7 different head hunters from different companies have contacted me regarding this position. I&#x27;ve said yes to every single one. Why? Because f--k them, thats why. 
 ​
 Thought I&#x27;d just share that story as it just happened and I am more than amused.

 Is there something I’m missing?

 In Teams, regarding AVD:
 I really hate all the move to AWS and AVD cloud vm stuff
 Always over promising and under achieving 
 ​
 my prediction: let&#x27;s move your brain to the cloud too... it&#x27;ll be cheaper and better... and faster... but you won&#x27;t be able to feel your toes

                              <span>Just need to vent some where.
 Had an engineer be a complete asshole because, &quot;outlook&quot; wasn&#x27;t working. Spent an hour and half with him fixing things that didn&#x27;t need fixing.
 Been at this specific company for almost 4 years and this is the 2nd occurrence of a worker having an attitude towards me ever. The first was just a new hire that needed an attitude check and literally was an asshole in front of the IT manager and IT director. So they backed me and even commended me for not retaliating. 
 We have no help desk. I was promoted years ago and they never replaced me. So for about 200+ it&#x27;s primarily me juggling stupid help desk and admin/engineering work with my boss helping occasionally. 
 All of this guys tickets are closed and resolved. Like it&#x27;s my fault he doesn&#x27;t ask to reopen tickets or put new ones in if something reoccurs. My bad I&#x27;m not babysitting you non stop while I have 1000 other things to do.
 Now my evening is off to a irate start because this jackass can&#x27;t put tickets in or be a normal person like literally everyone else. My bad!

                              <span>I have always been a firm believer that if your company wants to use a 3rd party provider to send out marketing or sales emails (or anything automated), that it is always best practice to use a subdomain or a different domain together; and setup the necessary DNS records, etc...... so that there&#x27;s a zero possibility of trashing our root domain&#x27;s email reputation in case something happens.
 Is that practice still considered best? I&#x27;ve been seeing automated emails from vendors with the FROM address being the root domain. Are they just being careless? Obviously best practices are likely applied, (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)... but is that considered enough to the point where companies are using their root domain to send automated emails out that way.

                              <span>Edit: Thanks for the input, folks! I&#x27;m also now trying to include in my question are there any specific certifications that are within reach of my high school kids? Assuming they&#x27;re in my program and are taking intro college-level classes in programming and info security, what&#x27;s appropriate and worth their time?
 Hi folks,
 ​
 I&#x27;m a high school teacher, running a great computer science department and we recently added a (for college credit) course in information security.
 ​
 I&#x27;m attempting to find out some information for the sake of my students interested in working in this field. I was hoping to get some guidance on credentials, certifications, college education, that sort of thing.
 I&#x27;m not the type of teacher who wants to just tell all of his students to go get a bachelor&#x27;s degree if it&#x27;s not necessarily going to suit them well for their career. Are there other ideas out there that are more appropriate? Do you need a B.S. to even get in the door? What subject area(s)?
 ​
 Thank you for any insight you might be able to share!

                              <span>Hi all! Been lurking in this thread for a LONG time, but figured this would be as good a time as any to finally post. My IT Director asked me to look into finding a Smart Card solution so that employees can log into PCs. We&#x27;re a small Hospital and many of the nurse stations have give or take 5 communal PCs that they need to log into the domain to use. I&#x27;ve tried convincing my boss to remove that step and just use a limited Kiosk account as all patient information is locked behind a second login and a remote connection (Parallells), but that&#x27;s been like trying to pull teeth. So, I&#x27;m trying to make this as easy as possible for our staff to log into their accounts and get things done. Any ideas for a badge scan or fingerprint solution to speed up the process? I really don&#x27;t have a lot of experience in this very specific subject and Googling this subject has been a mess. Figured you guys would have at least some recommendations.

                              <span>Have an owner who is complaining that his Outlook is running slow (which it is).
 Do a little recon and digging - his .ost file (Outlook is locally caching) is just under 50GB. He &quot;has&quot; to be delegate on 10+ people&#x27;s accounts too. &quot;Shockingly&quot;, he is not accepting this as the reason for his problem.
 He definitely is not liking my suggestions.
 Edit: please note, per the below MS article
  
Very large (25 GB or larger): An .ost file of this size increases the frequency of short pauses, especially while you are downloading new email messages.
  
and
  
In Outlook 2010 and later versions, the maximum size for a .pst file is 50 GB.

 ​
 Edit 2: so, I think I&#x27;ve talked him down off the cliff. I removed his profile and created a new one. I am watching the .ost grow though so we&#x27;ll see where this story ends...

                              <span>Hello all. I&#x27;m wondering what sort of laptops your companies are giving out to users these days? 
 We formerly had desktops, but we moved to a new office that the CEO insisted on setting up as a flexible workspace, so everyone needed laptops, and then covid showed up and we went remote.
 We currently have MS Surfaces (the CEO&#x27;s choice) through a 3rd party vendor. Most people seem to really like them, but I&#x27;m getting complaints from a few people that then need more powerful ones. Particularly a few people complain about the amount of ram they come with. I&#x27;ve got a user insisting they need at least 64 GB of ram to work properly, more than is available in a surface. I&#x27;m deeply skeptical of this particular user&#x27;s claim, but that&#x27;s a different issue. I sent him to his department head to argue with him about getting the budget. If he actually gets budget to buy one, I&#x27;ll need to source it whether I think he really needs it or not. 
 Anyway, what sort of laptops do you all like to send out? How much ram do they typically have?

                              <span>I have been in IT for over 10 years now, in different environments (school district, health care, manufacturing, etc.) And it baffles me that companies will spend THOUSANDS of dollars on software or equipment and don&#x27;t include IT in the conversation.
 I recently took a new job and was hired to help get a new software up and running. As I&#x27;m going through the requirements, I can&#x27;t find the options they want. I do my best, then email the software support asking if I&#x27;m missing anything. The support emails back that what I need isn&#x27;t even an option available. 
 So who authorized this? If the software can&#x27;t do the main thing you want it to do, who agreed to purchase it?!? Was the request even asked to the selling company before purchasing? What am I going to do with this software now? Thousands of dollars wasted.
 I&#x27;ll never know because I joined on after it was already purchased. But holy shit does it get me heated. End rant.

 ​
 I&#x27;ll go first.
 Last night I was upgrading esxi host from 6.5 to 7.0 and I selected &quot;new&quot; install instead of upgrade. I have never done anything like this, I don&#x27;t know if I was over tired not sure. Thankfully it only had one VM that was easily restored and no one even noticed.

                              <span>Has anyone had issues with the October Windows Desktop and Server cumulative patches that the 10\17 patch resolved? Looks to affect Windows 10/11 and Server.
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/release-health/status-windows-11-22h2
 ​
  
Microsoft has received reports that after installing KB5018427, some types of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) connections might have handshake failures. Note for developers: Affected connections are likely to be sending multiple frames within a single input buffer, specifically one or more complete records with a partial record that is less than 5 bytes all sent in a single buffer. When this issue is encountered, your app will receive SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE when the connection fails.
  
​
 I am about to do some testing with the monthly update and wondering what I should look for that might necessitate the OoB patch to also be deployed along with the cumulative.

                              <span>Is anyone finding cloud solutions like ConnectWise Control Access or TeamViewer adequate for SMB remote workers to connect from home to their office machines?
 In my last position, the remotes used RDP over VPN (with 2FA) which was plenty snappy with fiber at the office, and I also used ConnectWise for support. I found ConnectWise a less responsive in general than RDP but not unbearable, but I preferred RDP for fulltime work.
 RDS/Citrix would be overkill at my present position as a one-man show in a small office with just a couple of FT remotes and a few people who sometimes work remotely.
 ConnectWise Control Access pricing is very attractive. I would prefer to use it for support anyway, so I wanted to hear what others were doing in smaller offices with limited remote users.

 I want our syslog server to forward logs to another server (Tufin) but keep a copy of the logs. I found the forwarding rule in the /etc/rsyslog.conf file but does this just forwards the log and bypass the firstlog or will I get a copy of each log on both servers?

                              <span>I have an Associates in Information Technology. 
 Currently working a Systems Administrator role. But, I tend to have a good amount of downtime.
 So, my question ultimately is getting a general studies degree worth anything in our field? 
 It seems to be the only curriculum available online from my local college. 
 I have two years left of the GI Bill, but I don&#x27;t want to stop working to go to school. However I still want to use the benefits.

                              <span>So, I just got hired as an &quot;IT Specialist&quot; at a non-profit. I have little networking experience outside of installing switches, etc. (Fieldnation). They did not have a IT person before me. I am starting mostly starting from scratch.
 What I would like help with is building my stack. Currently, they are using Google Workspace and trying out Goodday for task management. They are a hybrid of Macs and a few pcs that they purchaced before hiring me. I am thinking about moving from Google Workspace to Microsoft 365 because that is what I am used to. In addition too, they are willing and able to move to a windows environment. This company has been very reassuring that I can move them in any direction and they will pay for it. Their major priority for is a new phone system. I am looking for a VOIP option. They also purchased a Sharp BP-70C55/70C65 before I got hired. It will get installed soon.
 We are about to split the current office team and move to a different floor.
 I feel like with help and research, I can groom this organization to a greater level.
 ​
 I appreciate you all&#x27;s help!!

                              <span>Hi, 
 ​
 I&#x27;m managing the (2) computers of a small library few hours a week, and i want to block adults sites on them.
 I&#x27;ve tried to block them using hosts file with this list : https://dsi.ut-capitole.fr/blacklists/
 But it froze explorer.exe, maybe due to the length of the file (4.5M lines) and the poor capacity of the computers.
 ​
 Do you have a smaller banlist which be usable on low config ?
 Should i try something else like changing the DNS ? (is openDNS good ?)
 Or do you have good parental control software to suggest ?
 ​
 Thanks,

 Do not run the PowerShell as an Administrator, unless you absolutely need to. So, when do you need to? When you are changing local system setting or deleting/modifying files that only Administrators have access to. When in doubt, run PowerShell normally and just try to run the command you wanna run.
 You never need to run a PowerShell as an Administrator, when you are remotely configuring resources, through PSSessions, CIM/WMI, or when using any other cmdlet that has a -Credentialparameter, such as the AD module.
 The gist of it is this: If you do not know why you need admin permissions, you should not use admin permissions.

I can&#x27;t find much online whether this is normal. Anybody have any suggestions to running down what could be causing this? Is there a event log generated on the source maybe or a corresponding event ID I could look at with more info?

 My question is, what specific certificate does it need? I would assume either SSL or code-signing, but as this is neither necessarily a website or an actual program to be deployed (it&#x27;s just for PS automation), I&#x27;m not sure what would be considered appropriate.

                              <span>So, more details here, I couldn&#x27;t catch the first BSOD, but while updating it also crashed a couple times, then it successfully installed the update, but even then it kept crashing.
 The errors I got were:
  
Irql not less or equal
 
Kmode exception not handled
 
Page fault in nonpaged area
 
Unexpected kernel mode trap
 
 This was all very late into the night so I decided to shut it off from bios when I got the chance and now today I decided to remove some plugged in USB devices and I also removed my second monitor (which uses a DVI adapter)
 Today it hasn&#x27;t crash once so far, I have plugged back in the usb devices but not the second monitor.
 I kinda suspect on the SSD because windows is installed in it, it&#x27;s also a drive I bought back in 2019, and it&#x27;s a 256gb drive with over 30TB of writes according to crystal disk info, but it also says that it&#x27;s in good health. The drive also has tons of hours since I usually let the PC on 24/7.
 Now, should I replace this drive nonetheless? Could the problem really be the DVI adapter? (I ran into problems with it before but it had been working for months until yesterday)
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi,
 Does anyone know how to disable the Outlook new email notification sound via group policy or by registry key? The only caveat is that if the user wants to enable the sound then they can go into settings are turn it back on.
 Thanks,
 W2

 I would like to be able to put connectwise tools, AV and other tools on it.
 Do I need a bonafide VM to do this?

                              <span>I feel as though I&#x27;m going insane. For the life of me, I cannot track down the cause of why this is happening. 
 A website I host https://semdeck.com (for reasons I cannot figure out) is showing two forward slashes at the end of it so it appears as semdeck.com//
 I&#x27;ve set it up the same as every other website I&#x27;ve ever built. Here is part of the .htaccess file:
  
# Always use https for secure connections 
 # Replace &#x27;www.example.com&#x27; with your domain name 
 # (as it appears on your SSL certificate) 
 RewriteEngine On 
 RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} 80 
 RewriteRule ^(.\)$ https://semdeck.com//$1 [R&#x3D;301,L]* 
  
 RewriteBase / 
 # rule 1: remove multiple leading slashes (directly after the TLD) 
 RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} \s/{2,} 
 RewriteRule (.\) $1 [R&#x3D;301,L]* 
 # rule 2: remove multiple slashes in the requested path 
 RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^(.\)/{2,}(.*)$* 
 RewriteRule (.\) %1/%2 [R&#x3D;301,L]* 
 
  
And the functions.php file contains the following:
  
/\** 
 \ Define Constants* 
 \/* 
 define( &#x27;ASTRA_THEME_VERSION&#x27;, &#x27;3.9.2&#x27; ); 
 define( &#x27;ASTRA_THEME_SETTINGS&#x27;, &#x27;astra-settings&#x27; ); 
 define( &#x27;ASTRA_THEME_DIR&#x27;, trailingslashit( get_template_directory() ) ); 
 define( &#x27;ASTRA_THEME_URI&#x27;, trailingslashit( esc_url( get_template_directory_uri() ) ) );
  
I thought that both of those are signaling that there should only be one &quot;/&quot; at the end of the domain but I guess not. Either way, I am completely out of guesses as to why this is happening. Perhaps a plugin conflict? I&#x27;ve gone into Yoast SEO and even modded the canonical URL for the homepage to no avail.
 Anyone have any idea what&#x27;s going on here?

                              <span>Some context:
 I work for a computer refurbishing/resale shop. We operate mostly through online sales and handle hundreds of laptops and desktops a month. I typically am responsible for refurbishing and repairing units for resale.
 We set up a WDS server just running on a local network (not connected publicly) using an old netgear router for handling DHCP to quickly load units. The WDS is configured properly and works , as long as the images are good.
 The issue I run into is sometimes is dism doesnt pull a good image from a unit, and breaks the WDS (Shows no available images if a bad image is present) . It took me a solid 3 weeks to figure out what was going on, but eventually came to the conclusion that if I delete the bad image from the server, then the WDS continues working properly.
 ​
 My question is this,
 Why are some images bad? and how can I fix it? 85% of images I make work flawlessly, while some simply refuse to make a working image. 
 Steps taken so far:
 Most recently we got some Dell 7460 AIO&#x27;s in, around 40 of them. I created an image as I always do, and loaded it on to the server. The issue occurred so I deleted the image and used a different unit to make an image, still no dice. I then tried using dism healthcheck and repair commands, dism sees nothing wrong with the image. I tried using compression on the image to see if that would make a difference. The image is Windows 11 Pro, and the Dell Optiplex 7460 is fully updated. I also tried making a Windows 10 image and that did not work either.
 I&#x27;m not sure if there is a correlation but here are some of the other models I cant get a working image for:
 Lenovo T540P
 Dell Latitude 5491
 Lenovo T460
 ​
 I cant understand why the WDS will simply reject some models. I&#x27;m hoping someone has some insight.

                              <span>Its happening, &quot;management&quot; agreed they don&#x27;t know what distribution lists to use.
 We have all the common ones, and some really specific ones...
  
all@
 announcements@
 office-LOCATION@
  
But the real issue is sometimes they don&#x27;t want to include &quot;contractors&quot;. We know who these folks are from Okta. But I cant make them use distribution lists, if they just want to send it to all.
 Does anyone have a good example of naming conventions for fixing the &quot;employee type&quot; problem? We have all the data/okta to solve this. Its mostly just doing a better job this time.
 &quot;management&quot; has proposed:
  
all@ for full/contingent workers
 all-extended@ for everyone human(no service accounts)
 contractors@ for contractors
  
This scenario would be CFO sending out internal financials, wants to not send to contractors.
 I personally hate all-extended. It reeks of all-except-some, and global-not-sales vibes.

                              <span>Most admins have Office 365 test tenants to simulate a small corporate environment to test scripts, install apps, and explore the new configurations without affecting the production environment. But, few admins run the scripts (which are downloaded from the internet) directly in the production domain. It&#x27;s not good to run any scripts directly to the production. 
 Admins can maintain the Office 365 test lab without an additional cost through Microsoft 365 Developer Program. You can use the test tenant for years if you use it regularly. Otherwise, it would expire in 90 days. You can&#x27;t retrieve data from the deleted tenant. So, If you have a budget that you can spend for your test tenant, then you better go with a business subscription.
 How do you maintain Office 365 test setups? You can share your techniques with fellow admins.

                              <span>Greeting,
 I find my self looking for a program that a small team could use to log what work they have done so that if in the future one of the other members needs to look up information on a old project he can find it easely. 
 A little more explanation as English is my third language and the explanaion on top is a bit vague.
 Recently a senior colleague unfortanatly passed away unexpectedly and now the 3 of us that are left find our self in a bit of a pickle as we are getting questions on how to manage past systems he has set up withouth having any documentation on the process he used to set up said systems. Most of the time things are written down in Word and stored locally somewhere or backed up to the archive under vague names. 
 So this got me thinking that there should be a program out there that is on prem (since we cannot use cloud features due to security reasons) that one can get, where whe can use it as a work log that anyone of use can access and see how and what other people have done on past projects.
 P.S. I hope this is the correct subreddit for this question, if not let me know and I will delete the post (also if you know the correct subredit, I would appreciate that info).

 When I run it using our RMM, since the install is running under the system account, it doesn&#x27;t install for all domain users.
 Is there something I can add to the .XML to make it install machine wide? This is my .XML so far:

 The IT dept. is the admin on the computer so I can&#x27;t install anything without them logging in. I have Chrome installed and am a Google user for personal stuff (email, keep, drive, etc.)
 Am I &quot;safe&quot; to use my own Google profile on this computer (with saved bookmarks, passwords, etc.) Does McAfee &quot;spy&quot; on me and/or &quot;report home&quot;? Or is it just an encryption service in the event the laptop gets stolen?

                              <span>So, the past few days besides all other tasks I do. I am looking into the possibility to containerize Local Administrative Rights in Windows 10. I have found some information but they are talking about gMSA and &quot;run as&quot; / &quot;give full control&quot; to an application as domain admin.
 The situation is, that in our organisation we develop applications ourselves and to execute them administrative permissions are neccessary to update / install and/or run the application. 
 I don&#x27;t want to give myself a lot of work in maintaining and continously sending an IT employee their way to authorize an installation.
 Anyone has some tips to get around this issue? Without losing security? Because I preferrably want to withdraw all admin permissions and only give them out when needed. So I am curious if sysadmins here have a creative solution for this?
 Again thanks for the help in advance!

However i have searched far and wide over the Ethernet and i could not come up with a possible implementation that already exist more because the terms &quot;ip scheduling&quot; provide result in different topics.
 For my current project i have a couple of devices connected over a closed network to my main server. This server is publicly reachable on another Ethernet interface. The devices are normally accessed because packages are forwarded from the server by nginx/iptables config through the server. The idea was that there is a front-end hosted on the main server where people can reserve a time slot to gain access to one of these internal devices. Then only in said time slot would the packages be forwarded and else dropped.
 ​
 It feels like i am not the first one to implement such a feature. However i have searched far and wide over the Ethernet and i could not come up with a possible implementation that already exist more because the terms &quot;ip scheduling&quot; and like wise search queries provide result in different topics like human resources or dhcp static ip reservation (github was full of people making there own hotel reservations systems which would often popup).
 ​
 Therefore the question if someone may now if such a system already exist? If not i could write my own with nginx or iptables something as the gatekeeper is my plan.

                              <span>Hello all!
 9 months ago i started working in IT, no degree and basic understanding with the maintanance of servers , computers, standard e-mail and hardware stuff.
 We were a team of 3 and the &#x27;manager&#x27; explained alot regarding the server-structure.
 However, he left the company 4 months ago as well as my other colleague. 
 Currently i&#x27;m facing alot of error&#x27;s on the application side ( which i have 0 experience in ) and it&#x27;s causing alot of stress since im left in the dark.
 ​
 Any tips on how to handle this situation? ( about ~70 people in the office )

                              <span>My ubuntu cloud server has begun having random spikes of IOPS/read and cpu every few days. I&#x27;ve tried to keep some logging scripts running but even they stop logging while server is unresponsive during this spike. The spike is anything from 5mins-1hr long
 Because of being unable to log or login, I&#x27;m at a loss how to debug this,any suggestions?
 We deployed upgraded versions of mongo/mysql and other apps via docker but I can&#x27;t kill them for days at a time to check server behavior.
 Logging script: while true; do (echo &quot;%CPU %MEM ARGS $(date)&quot; &amp;&amp; ps -e -o pcpu,pmem,args --sort&#x3D;pcpu | tail) &gt;&gt; ps.log; sleep 5; done &amp; while true; do (echo &quot;%CPU %MEM ARGS $(date)&quot; &amp;&amp; ps -e -o pcpu,pmem,args --sort&#x3D;pmem | tail) &gt;&gt; ps2.log; sleep 5; done &amp;

                              <span>So yesterday I managed to infect myself with this: https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e268f2982e14d363e7f7874696d231701234d4b426c3a1bef7271cc0bf766706/summary It came with a very well made, legit looking mail. The main reason why I was so careless is because the sender name was very similar to one of our customers. The virus itself was bundled inside of an img file. We use sophos central email gateway with all bells and whistles enabled - including the sandbox. The mail made it through all of that, windows 11 defender (also with all bells and whistles enabled) didn&#x27;t catch it either. 
 With the help of someone smarter than me we managed to gain access to the ftp server that the virus uses to upload extracted login information. Afterwards we sent an abuse notice to the hoster who immediately deleted all contents and locked the customer out. 
 We use the default sophos list for blocked attachment file types (sophos specifically recommends using it instead of making a list on your own!). I&#x27;m trying to change that to a whitelist so for example only PDF files are allowed everything else goes into quarantine. But apparently sophos central doesn&#x27;t even have that option or am I blind?

                              <span>Hello /rsysadmin
 ​
 First, if this is not supposed to be posted here, you all have my sincere apologies.
 ​
 I am a web developer (don&#x27;t throw stones yet ^^ ) and I come to you looking for advice.
 ​
 As a pet project, I am building an application to streamline data collection in non technical teams.
 It is a server based application (PHP) with a web interface so I would see it either as a cloud product or on an in house server.
 I am trying to do things the right way, and one of my next steps is to think about user authentication.
 For the basics, i made a username or email | password authentication, users stored in the database, password encrypted using bcrypt. The administrator create user accounts and generate an account specific url for account activation. Transmission of the url is the responsibility of the admin.
 To go further, I plan on implementing some SSO methods.
 My guesses are:
  
google
 openId
 microsoft AD (this one will be fun to debug, as I never understood windows server XD)
  
Finally come the question:
 If you had to sysadmin such a solution, what SSO solution would you expect to find by default ?
 (And to go further, what kind of functionnality would you expect to find out of the box ? )
 ​
 Thank you in advance :)

 I&#x27;m trying to integrate this Policy into our noncloud Active Directory Domain. But it&#x60;s a local policy and I can&#x27;t find the corresponding admx file.
 ​
 How would one go about to propagate that Local Computer Policy to all clients?

                              <span>I am just having the discussion of whether or not to remove users from the AAD sync when de-provisioning.
 We are in a hybrid environment. During user deprovisioning, after the users are disabled and the associated license groups are removed, we currently keep them synchronized via AAD Connect.
 ​
 I know that when the users are de-provisioned, they are moved to an OU in AD that is not synchronized by AAD-Connect.
 ​
 I can&#x27;t find a &quot;best practice&quot; or similar in the Microsoft documentation, is there a recommendation from Microsoft?
 ​
 How do you guys handle this?

 I&#x27;ve been trying to configure custom URL handlers that work on Mac&#x27;s for our business, but without any success. We want a handler to open links to local files, and open these files with Finder.
 So far I&#x27;ve tried:
 Lincastor https://onflapp.github.io/blog/pages/LinCastor.html
 RCDefaultApp https://www.rubicode.com/Software/RCDefaultApp/
 SwiftDefaultApp https://github.com/LordKamina/SwiftDefaultApps
 https://hublog.hubmed.org/archives/001154 
 RCDefaultApp &amp; SwiftDefaultApp are outdated and not compatible with the OS version we&#x27;re using, while Lincastor doesn&#x27;t do anything when I add a new URL handler.
 Can anyone help me out? I&#x27;m relatively new to MacOS. The macOS version we currently have installed is Monterey.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello,
 We&#x27;re currently trying to secure the network even more and we&#x27;d like to setup 802.1x auth for printers to put allowed printers in the correct vlan, and unknown devices in a quarantine vlan.
 Computers are authenticated using their AD computer account, and printer don&#x27;t have that.
 Certificates are also not a good solution since printers are not able to request renewal themselves... 
 I&#x27;ve seen posts saying &quot;you just have to create a AD user account with the macaddress and same for the password&quot; but no one seems to care about the fact that this is a huge security issue.
 The only thing I found was to create a &quot;Connection Request Policy&quot; for each MAC and put them above every other regular policies.
 Conditions are :
 - Calling station ID &#x3D; mac address
 - NAS Port Type &#x3D; Ethernet
 Settings :
 - Authentication : Accept users without validating credentials
 It does not have to be 100% secure but at least prevent users from connecting untrusted devices like some 3rd party contractor who comes for the day and needs &quot;internet&quot;... but I&#x27;m still looking for ideas or a better way to do it.
 Thanks in advance :)

                              <span>Hey, I recently installed Windows 11 ARM on a raspberry pi and installed Windows Admin Center to manage my servers. Problem is I can only access it via local host which means I have to RDC into that slow little machine. Has anyone found a reliable way to open WAC up on a non server install to anyone browsing the ip? I can protect it here via my management VLAN.

 https://imgur.com/a/Ddj19JQ
 Checking the event viewer in the GroupPolicy log, for every client side extension I see an entry like the following:
 Starting Group Policy Internet Settings Extension Processing.
 List of applicable Group Policy objects: (Changes were detected.)
 None 
 In the system log I find one entry:
 The Group Policy settings for the user were processed successfully. New settings from 0 Group Policy objects were detected and applied.
 Both log sources indicate that all user GPOs vanished from the client. gpresult shows for the user details under &quot;Organizational Unit&quot; that I am in a OU where inheritance is blocked and no GPO applies. However, this is not the case. My user is in the right OU!
 When I manually run a gpupdate /force everything goes back to normal. Nothing else was changed, indicating that it should have worked the whole time.

                              <span>I recently moved a drive to Sharepoint, and i used Sharepoint Migration Tool for the task.
 Since SPMT didnt give me any sort of errors, and telling me that no files was skipped, i belived that everything was in perfect order.
 However, i can see that it is far from in perfect order. Lots of files and folders is missing. And it seems random which files is missing and which dont. There is no difference in rights on the folders, where files is missing, and there are no obvious reason to why the files are missing.
 Running an incremental task with SPMT makes no difference, it wont acknowledge that there are files it doesn&#x27;t sync up.
 Its quite a large filedrive. My original plan was to sync everything with OneDrive to a temp location on a fileserver, and then have something like FreeFileSync to compare files and sync the missing files. But is not a viable way since OneDrive taking a really long time to get something in sync, and i dont really believe that it can handle all that data, because its also freezing up on me.
 ​
 TLDR;
 So im looking for some tool, not SPMT, since experience, that can compare my files on the fileserver to a Sharepoint site and sync the missing files. Preferably free.
 Ideas?

                              <span>I have set up an Apache2 site on an Ubuntu server which worked up until I added an SSL certificate. At first I got an error saying I was missing www-browser, which I then installed, but now I am getting no errors from Apache2 itself and the site still will not load.
 I had used certbot to create and apply my SSL certificate, this is the configuration file it had made.
 Have I done something wrong here?

 I currently operate an enterprise network that had almost no distribution layer. Our biggest campuses go switched access layer -&gt; SVIs on the core switches. Recently I implemented a routed distribution layer across an ELAN. I am toying with the idea of using QinQ to support a cookie cutter config style for access layer switches while preserving unique address space per different access areas under the same distribution or core switch. 
 For example, building group A will have different /24s for it&#x27;s SVIs than building group B, even though both use a switched access layer that goes back to the same routing distro switch in building group A. The standar…</span>

 I&#x27;m testing a firewall in my lab, decided to do a little BGP just for kicks and ended up here. In the past few hours, I&#x27;ve learned all sorts of strange things in regards to rules that some ISPs have when peering with customers. Are ISPs generally that anal when peering with customers? With the ease of filtering with BGP, why?

 I&#x27;m working on a multi-site network full of Ubiquiti EdgeSwitch devices. There are 3 LANs all bridged together. The VLANs were configured incorrectly by my predecessor which will be addressed however I do not think this is causing the issue because the config of the VLANs hasn&#x27;t been touched for a few years. This is a fairly new issue. 
 In this case there are two buildings connected together by a PTP fiber circuit provided by Spectrum. On both sides the circuit is converted to Ethernet. In Building A (BA) that Ethernet is going into a EdgeSwitch 16 XG (SW1) . In Building B (BB) the Ethernet goes into an EdgeSwitch 48 port switch (SW2).
 The issue is some computers in BB cannot communicate with some computers in BA. For instance, the troubled c…</span>

 The idea here is that if I get 1 new SSH connection per minute (or less) from unique src IPs, I log them as &#x27;ssh_unknown_accept&#x27; and accept them. More than 1 SSH connection per minute from different source IPs, I drop t…</span>

                              <span>For any ISPs offering 10G DIA or XGSPON links to residential and SMB customers, what sort of gateway are they using and how is the performance?
 I don&#x27;t have any 10G equipped gateways to play with so I&#x27;m messing around with some servers and 10G NICs. Here&#x27;s the lab, all are Dell R620s with dual Xeon E5-2670, 32GB of memory, and Intel X520-DA2 NICs connected with DACs:
 Server A 172.16.0.1/30 | Server B &quot;WAN&quot; 172.16.0.2/30 &quot;LAN&quot; 192.168.1.1/24 | Server C 192.168.1.100/24 (DHCP) 
 Servers A and C are running Debian 11 on fresh installs. Server B is running pfsense with a basic NAT configuration. Server A is running iperf3 as a server. Server C is iperf3 client.
 If I boot up iperf3 and do a regular test from Server C to Server A:
 upload [ ID] Interval Transfer Bitrate [ 5] 0.00-60.04 sec 38.0 GBytes 5.44 Gbits/sec receiver download [ ID] Interval Transfer Bitrate Retr [ 5] 0.00-60.04 sec 26.3 GBytes 3.76 Gbits/sec 89 sender bidir [ ID][Role] Interval Transfer Bitrate Retr [ 5][RX-S] 0.00-60.03 sec 37.0 GBytes 5.29 Gbits/sec receiver [ 8][TX-S] 0.00-60.03 sec 25.7 GBytes 3.68 Gbits/sec 72 sender 
 Of course, better results with 8 threads:
 upload (-P8) [ ID] Interval Transfer Bitrate [SUM] 0.00-60.02 sec 54.6 GBytes 7.82 Gbits/sec receiver download (-P8) [ ID] Interval Transfer Bitrate Retr [SUM] 0.00-60.01 sec 49.6 GBytes 7.10 Gbits/sec 685 sender bidir (-P8) [ ID][Role] Interval Transfer Bitrate Retr [SUM][RX-S] 0.00-60.01 sec 40.3 GBytes 5.77 Gbits/sec receiver [SUM][TX-S] 0.00-60.01 sec 26.8 GBytes 3.84 Gbits/sec 224 sender 
 I notice the bidirectional performance is slightly better, but basically the same with more threads. Is this a NIC limitation or possibly tuning? I know the x520 is fairly old by now. 
 Has anyone done any testing like this? Has anyone tested NAT throughput on more affordable hardware like Mikrotik or Ubiquiti?

                              <span>My understanding is that if let&#x27;s say there are multiple devices in a LAN and device A wants to make request to a webserver on the internet -
 Source IP of A will be replaced with the IP of the router from the packet which is going out to the WAN.
 So if the source was 10.10.0.1:9876 and IP of router was 125.12.31.7 then router will translate source to 125.12.31.7:5000 (5000 being a random available port) 
 Now the router will note down :
 Source : 125.12.31.7:5000 &#x3D; 10.10.0.1:9876 
 So that when the packet comes back from the server it will look up in the table and send it to the Computer A. 
 If this computer A had made multiple requests, they all would have been allotted different portnumbers from the available pool. Same if Computer B had made a request. 
 So basically it&#x27;s the unique port number which is being used here to determine where to send the packed when it enters router from outside world. 
 What if the number of requests from within the LAN to WAN exceeded the number of available port numbers? What would happen? I mean there are only 64,512 (65,535 -1,023) available ports at max.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to solve an issue in our environment where, as developers continue to work remotely, we have homebrew devices that need to be on our network to recieve code pushes from our Jenkins servers. These devices are all custom and not capable of having additional software installed on them.
 I have attempted to connect these devices to GlobalProtect enabled RaspberryPi devices, sharing the GP IP, which gives them access into our network, but this solution fails because the devices are not visible behind the Pi, and are not reachable to have code pushed to them.
 We have deployed at least 1 home firewall for a key developer but this is not a sustainable approach. Is anyone familiar with a product that would fit this need, or deployed something similar?
 Also, ideally the solution would have some sort of security (at least MAC auth) so that any random device can not connect to our network. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve inherited a network that is using public IPs inside it&#x27;s LAN. I&#x27;ve been tasked to begin cleaning these up and make them proper private IPs. Another fun fact about this network is that the original designer tagged Vlan 1 on all uplink ports. Of course Vlan 1 is still also the default &amp; native vlan throughout the network. Our main data subnet, cameras and door controls are all on Vlan 1 across the entire company.
 The project requirement is to implement department vlans at our main site and have a few other vlans at other remote sites as needed. Of course they want to move the cameras off the data subnet and also use vlans for IOT, printers, and a few other departments at some sites.
 Our WAN is connected using AT&amp;T Metro ASE Layer 2. We have an Aruba 3810 L3 Switch as the gateway at each site. IP Routing is enabled on each of these L3 Switches.
 We have 12 remote sites, STP is in use at each site, but we only connect using static routes. No ospf, rip, bgp, etc.
 My initial thought is to first install all of the new subnets/vlans throughout the network. Then slowly begin moving the Vlan 1 devices over to the new subnets. We have a server team that will handle most of the systems that will need their IP changed so my main task is to ensure connectivity.
 How would you handle moving users off of Vlan 1 onto the new subnets? For all you L2 WAN folks, is there a better way to approach this?
 I appreciate your thoughts &amp; inputs.

                              <span>So, I just got hired as an &quot;IT Specialist&quot; at a non-profit. I have little networking experience outside of installing switches, etc. (Fieldnation). They did not have a IT person before me. I am starting mostly starting from scratch.
 What would be some good options for someone like me to start off with and a growing organization like them? This is probably a loaded question, but I appreciate any advice.
 We are about to split the current office team and move to a different floor. They purchased a Sharp BP-70C55/70C65 before I got hired. It will get installed soon.
 I feel like with help and research, I can groom this organization to a greater level.

                              <span>Posting for a friend that doesn&#x27;t have a reddit account: 
 I&#x27;ve recently started working as a sysadmin + network guy for a small business, around 50 employees and up to a 100 devices if we take into account mobile phones.
 The company has a dumpster tier firewall that&#x27;s basically not doing anything and a vm running pfsense for openvpn. There are around 8 ubiquiti &#x27;enterprise&#x27; switches in the network and a few APs. 
 I would like to replace the firewall with something a bit more manageable and feature rich. Naturally i&#x27;m thinking of Fortinet etc for the price but I&#x27;ve also seen the Dream Machine Pro from Ubiquiti which has the features we need at a really low price (I assume it&#x27;s not a great unit...) and would allow me to manage the rest of our switches centrally. You can&#x27;t even monitor traffic on the switches without a gateway anyway which sucks so I&#x27;m tempted to go down this route instead.
 If the dream machine pro supported openvpn for remote workers I would grab it but it doesn&#x27;t so I&#x27;m still hesitant. 
 Do you guys think it&#x27;s better to grab an actual enterprise level switch from Fortinet or maybe a pfsense plus box from netgate instead of a dream machine pro?

                              <span>Hello guys, 
 I was wondering if in the ASA for the advanced syslog configuration with logging list there are Message IDs regarding when a user logs in and logs out of the appliance through SSH.
 I looked at Cisco’s Secure Firewall ASA Syslog Messages but didn’t find any.
 I have thought about using an EEM applet but I think the syslog list will be more easily implemented.

                              <span>A network redesign was in process when I took over this job. There’s still remnants of the old layer 2 192.168.x.x around and the ultimate goal is to get rid of it completely but that is going to be a rather complex and lengthy process due to VPN tunnels and a bunch of other things. 
 What I need to figure out is how to get that 192.168.x.x network on to the new side of the network. I need to migrate VMs that are on the 192 side over to new hardware that lives on the other side of the firewall. It is both physically and logically separated other than the firewall that has an interface for each side. New fiber and cables have been ran for the new side of the network. The image below shows an example of how the network is designed and what I’m trying to accomplish. I thought about changing vlan tags and tagging everything on the new side and trying an untagged vlan for the 192 but I’m needing some help and ideas.

 I know both will work but just wondering on the best practise? There is no servers internally and nothing that&#x27;s needing DNS resolution internally.
 What&#x27;s people&#x27;s thoughts know this ?? I think my feeling is set it to the router incase I need to set any DNS records on the draytek for something.

 According to this doc, the ASR9000 can take 1.2 million routes. Is that routes in the RIB or the FIB?
 I have an e-BGP connection to an upstream internet provider and I take a full route table (approx 900k routes) If I take a second connection to a different upstream to a second provider also with a full route table will I exceed the max allowed routes? Or, will it be OK because BGP will only take the best routes between the two and discard the others in the route table?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi all, I am in possession of a few IP-ranges as a Hosting company. 
 I encounter difficulity online with my IP&#x27;s (IPv4) because all kind of Third Parties identify me incorrectly as Polish. While I am infact in The Netherlands. 
 These GEO IP DB&#x27;s I know of, and are reporting NL correctly: 
 Ripe.net
 Maxmind
 IP2Location 
 Do you guys and gals know maybe more GEO IP DB&#x27;s that I should contact for GEO IP Corrections? 
 Please help, for me it&#x27;s a serious problem. 
 Thank you all so much in advance.

                              <span>Context: 30 users. Cisco ASA router managing DHCP &gt; 16-port dumb switch &gt; 4 port switch(es)
 https://imgur.com/a/nrG2JcM for a basic network diagram
 Had an issue where *out of nowhere, after years of this setup* the Cisco ASA got flooded with 169.254 addresses and killed the network. 
 I know what you&#x27;re thinking - why the f*** do you have such cheap dumb ass unmanaged networking equipment for a 30 user environment? Because we&#x27;re cheap and stupid and have no money. Believe me I&#x27;ve tried. I don&#x27;t want to go any further into my thoughts in case of this post being found to be honest, but it is not a favourable position I am in.
 Anyways,
 I figured there was maybe a network loop happening, with this being just as the office was closing I got everyone to leave and I powered everything off. I determined that 1 small switch with 2 computers hanging off it was tripping the network when powered back on. The other switches/computers were repowered and are OK.
 The 2 computers appear fine, like I have pretty detailed software inventories using our endpoint protection agent, and indeed plugging the laptops in elsewhere, no issue.
 This is where I am out of diagnosis, knowledge, experience and wit. So I guess I can blame the switch being worth about $10, but why would it be spamming 169.254 addresses?
 I have now plugged the &quot;faulty&quot; switch in elsewhere and it no longer trips the network. Has this been a red herring all along?
 Moral of story is - we need better equipment so I can actually see which ports/devices these addresses were coming from. But I am still in the sad situation where I cannot properly explain the outage, so hoping for ideas.
 ***Disclaimer. I bring this post with great humility, regret and pleading forgiveness. Yes, it is barely an amateur setup for a business turning over millions of $. Just trying to get by.

                              <span>Howdy y&#x27;all!
 Looking for tips/pointers on dealing with multiple internet circuits without SD-WAN appliances.
 I&#x27;m fairly well rounded with network and systems administration, but due to working in medium sized orgs most of my career, I&#x27;m definitely in the &quot;jack of all trades, leader of none&quot; camp.
 With this hurricane that recently ripped here through Florida, it&#x27;s got me looking at now wanting to add some WAN redundancy.
 I&#x27;m about midway though the lifecycle of a sizable investment in ISR 4ks as my branch office routers/firewall. Our branches all have a single internet circuit and a basic AVPN circuit from a big ISP. The AVPN doesn&#x27;t have any internet access option setup, it is only used for a private WAN.
 The idea is that I&#x27;d like to drop a 2nd, cheaper circuit for backup internet acc…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m the network admin for a client who is having intermittent internet issues. I contacted their ISP who sent out a tech to investigate. I asked the tech about removing the 3-way splitter in place, wondering if it had degraded and possibly causing issues. The tech tested the signals with an expensive looking tool and determined the signals coming in were good. At one point, he did indicate we could remove the splitter without issue. But, them he tested it again before proceeding and noticed an issue. 
 The way the tech explained it was if we remove the splitter, we would gain 5dB somewhere, but then lose 5dB somewhere else which would push past a certain threshold that would cause sync issues. Im not even sure it was dB, but I have to assume. He wasnt great at talking smart and I wasnt great at knowing what he was talkinh about. Im not an expert in coax cable signaling and understanding readings. I have worked at an ISP in tech support and understand the basics and sync issues, but I never got trained or learned much about this. Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for recommendations for learning the best practices regarding setting up OSPF and iBGP in a large network, particularly as it relates to traffic engineering and path selection.
 I&#x27;m already familiar with the basic configuration of these protocols in a medium sized single campus environment with bandwidth to spare, but I&#x27;ve recently moved to a new employer and am in the beginning stages of setting up a network to connect many data centers around the world with our own IP space. As a result we&#x27;ll have many entry and exit points with various network providers. Now latency and available bandwidth are very real issues that I&#x27;ve not previously had to think about.
 Any tips on route metrics, link costs, BGP communities / filtering, local preference, ect... Would be very helpful.
 Blogs posts, books, or personal anecdotes all welcome.

                              <span>Hey,
 I&#x27;ve been researching MTP fibre cables and can get my head around, just about, Type A, B and C (and AF), but I&#x27;ve seen a &quot;universal polarity&quot; https://www.fs.com/uk/products/143164.html?attribute&#x3D;6679&amp;id&#x3D;299323 but very little documentation about on what that actually means.
 Can anyone explain? And why I&#x27;d use it over the other types?
 Thanks!

 For the ones that have these types of jobs what is it like on a day to day?
 How did you get to this point in your life to go that route vs traditional on-prem hardware?
 Been in IT for years mainly deal with onsite network switches/routers/firewalls/WAN Services, with a few CompTIA/Cisco certs as well what does this translate to for Cloud Services?
 What are some basic job requirements are needed for cloud infrastructure jobs and is the pay much higher and if so then why?

 Both Switches have vlan 1 no ip DHCP and manually configured IP addresses on VLAN 2.
 I can plug my laptop into an access port on vlan 2 both ping and ssh into any of the switches.
 If I attempt to ssh username@switchIP from the console of any switch, it just hangs. 
 Any Ideas?

We&#x27;re running out of IP addresses on the /23 network, would it be okay to increase the network to a /22 without causing broadcast issues or, is a /22 too large of a broadcast domain?
 Normally I would just create a additional subnet/ VLAN however, creating a second network/ VLAN wouldn&#x27;t be ideal as ideally we need a single SSID.
 We use DHCP exclusively on this subnet with no static addresses - would it be a good idea to increase the network to a /22 but only increase our DHCP scope to 6-700 IP addresses to limit the size of the broadcast domain as much as possible?

                              <span>I currently have two routers running in my small business network setup. One is setup for the main network and is my Fortinet 80f. It currently has a 1gb circuit from ISP 1. The other is a Pfsense sg-3100 which is set up for our Kraft&#x27;s team only and it has its own 1gb circuit from a different ISP. My problem is the ISP on my main router is pretty crappy and has outages all the time. I would like to utilize the 1GB on my 2nd router for failover. I figured there must be a way to configure the lan port on the pfsense router to be able to utilize the circuit on the main router. Any ideas on how i should proceed with this configuration? vlans, bridge mode,??? help please!

                              <span>Good evening everyone,
 I ask you if you know of any other operators that allow you to view the statistics of your network, such as WeatherMap or traffic graphs on the backbones.
 An example is OVH, which displays its backbones and relative &quot;load&quot; percentages at this address: http://weathermap.ovh.net/#europe
 Another example is the GARR network which allows you to view more data than the previous one, also including graphs of aggregate traffic on the links.
 Also Nerim (France ISP) if you click on &quot;Accès Invité&quot; its share own graphs.
 Than you!

                              <span>Hi all,
 There are a plethora of snippet manager apps for developers, with syntax highlighting, etc, available for macOS, eg: - SnipperApp - Snip - massCode - SnippetsLab - Quiver
 ...and so on. 
 Some of those are free, some are one time payment, and some are subscription. Some are simple, some more elaborate, but all of the ones above are really designed for Developers - the syntax highlighting supports only programming and scripting languages, really. 
 I was wondering if any of you guys who are network engineers and also mac users have an app that would serve well as a snippet manager with syntax highlighting for Cisco, Juniper and other network config formats? 
 I&#x27;m currently using MacVim with vim-wiki plugin, and it works reasonably well, but I would like something with a bit more structure, where I can more easily search through and look for notes / config snippets. 
 Thanks!

 I have a couple ASR1001-x routers and enabled bfd. I see the older bfd session are “running in software”, but this new one I created is running in “hardware”. Running BFD in HW seems to be better for CPU. Is there a method/order etc… to force those bfd session to go into hardware instead of software?

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;ve got a branch office that was previously sending Internet traffic to the ISP and local office subnet over an IPsec tunnel w/ bgp. The plan now is to send local subnet traffic AND all internet traffic over this tunnel (in this case, the other end is Prisma cloud, but scenario should be the same if it was the HQ) This is my first time sending all traffic over the tunnel, so the routing intricacies escape me a bit. 
 https://imgur.com/a/jYJZweo A scribble diagram to help visualize and give better detail.
 ​
 So initially, changing the next hop for 0.0.0.0/0 to Tunnel.1 would bring the office completely down. My understanding now is that it&#x27;s basically trying to send the IKE and ESP traffic etc over a tunnel that doesn&#x27;t exist yet.
 ​
 So I&#x27;ve done a little bit of research and it sound like I have to have a static route that goes to the ISP still, but at a lower priority:
 0.0.0.0/0 Next hop eth1.4 172.0.0.2 (isp) Priority 15
 for the IKE/ESP traffic for tunnel creation.
 ​
 Then have another route for all other traffic (local subnet and Internet) with a higher priority, so local office traffic flows as before and so Internet traffic can pass to Prisma/HQ for inspection.
 0.0.0.0/0 Next hop tunnel.1 Priority 10
 ​
 The tunnel traffic is also using BGP, the traffic to the ISP is not.
 ​
 Any insight and/or corrections welcome! Thank you all in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently working in tech support (just over 3 years now) and really am wanting to move over to sysadmin. I&#x27;ve sent out a handful of applications and am having no luck so far. I&#x27;ve realized that there is a huge gap in knowledge and experience between tech support and sysadmin.
 I am &quot;level 2&quot; at my company and deal with our business products so I work with admins vs home users which has given me some understanding of what a sysadmin is, but I&#x27;m still missing a lot of what&#x27;s required for a sysadmin position.
 Is a helpdesk job going to be my best option for getting into a sysadmin role? I&#x27;m hesitant to pursue helpdesk since I&#x27;ll more than likely lose a noticeable amount of pay, but there is no more growth for me in tech support and I would be able to make more in the long run as a sysadmin.
 Has anyone here gone directly from tech support to sysadmin? If so, any advice on making that switch?

 What&#x27;s the recommended way to deploy printers in the post PrintNightmare world? Small AD environment with under a 100 users with a print server. How would it differ for printers with a V3 driver versus ones that offer a V4?

 I work in IT for a small insurance firm. I accidentally discovered that our website was having issues loading when troubleshooting a different problem and found some random text in german appearing on the homepage. Upon inspecting the source code there are TONS of links that point to gambling websites and other stuff involving crypto. Our insureds use the website to log into their portal which doesn’t contain any PHI but it does have PII such as addresses, phone numbers, etc.. Is it safe to assume that there are keyloggers stealing login credentials and possibly worse things going on?
 I emailed our webdev but he isn’t in the office today and hasn’t responded yet. I’m not sure what our next steps should be.
 EDIT: No we don’t use WordPress

                              <span>Grumpy old IT guy, coming in hot again.
 We had a filesystem migration to a new server this weekend. Figured there would be a few hiccups, given how thorough (/s) our testing team was. Sure enough got a P1 ticket that they are unable to process files from a system this morning. Turns out they were using sftp to push files up to the old server for one of the data flows.
 So, easy enough fix. Once I was sucked into the P1 group call this morning, I told them exactly what needed to be done. Put in a request to get ssh access to the new server, and here is the new path to the directory. Easy peasy, just like I sent out last week.
 Cut to 6 hours later. The call now has over 20 people on it, including management. They are dissecting all the data flow diagrams, and just ruled out the application server as the issue about an hour ago. Two managers asked me to rejoin the call, and before they could even &#x27;recap&#x27; everything they&#x27;ve done so far, I pasted a screenshot of what I told them needed to be done from 6 hours ago, and got dead silence.
 Seems one of the offshore managers (yes, this is ALL coming from our offshore &quot;support partner&quot;), stepped in at the end of the call this morning to manage the issue. They are supposedly working on the access requests now and will let me know. In other news, now management wants me to write up an RCA as to the problem, and corrective instructions. Sure, no one read my emails over the last couple weeks warning of this change, they ignored my instructions for the fix this morning, and the still don&#x27;t seem to fathom what they did wrong. That about covers it.

                              <span>We are patching it monthly and we STILL are getting high vulnerability scores among the workstation fleet. Considering the wealth of PDF viewers available, to say nothing of the fact that most modern browsers can open them natively, I was wondering what the user backlash would be if we just uninstalled it across the board. Then the question would be whether to replace it with, well, nothing (i.e let them use browsers) or instead deploy Foxit or PDF-Xchange or whatever.
 Anyone ever covered anything like that?
 ADDENDUM: I don&#x27;t mean Adobe Acrobat. Just Reader. Acrobat certainly has its vulnerabilities too but a hugely smaller foothold in the fleet.

                              <span>Hi
 We are currently using EAP-TLS with Computer Certificates to authenticate corporate assets before granting them access to our network using EAP-TLS. We have recently been discussing whether to extend this to the chaining of both Machine and User authentication.
 We are currently discussing whether to perform the User Authentication using PEAP (EAP-MSCHAPV2) or EAP-TLS with a User Certificate. 
 For Machine Auth I would always use Certificates rather than PEAP, but is it just as easy to manage user certificates? And are there any security concerns? From a Machine Auth perspective, the user has no business touching the certificate unless they have local administrator rights on the PC (And they don&#x27;t).
 In this case, the Certificate will be issued to the User itself, so what kind of access do they get to the certificate? Will they be able to possibly export it with a few tweaks even though we issue it as &#x27;non-exportable&#x27; from a PKI perspective? The fact that they have just the slightest access to the certificate itself, makes me wonder if it would be best to stick with PEAP for User Auth and keep Certificate Based Auth for the Machine only.

                              <span>This is a bit of a broad question, but just looking for the most common setup/reason. I spotted a PowerEdge R740 Server at a company that recently did a partial hardware refresh. They have 5x 3.84 TB SAS SSD&#x27;s in this server, which seems a bit unusual to me. I would have expected to see an even number of drives for SSD&#x27;s, not an odd number. I thought RAID5 shouldn&#x27;t be used with SSD&#x27;s? A single boot drive doesn&#x27;t seem like a good idea (plus 3.84 TB is a lot for a boot drive). I suppose one could be a hot spare since they don&#x27;t have on-site IT Staff, nor do they have an MSP. Their IT Department is at their main office hundreds of miles away and they fly in as-needed. 
 Anyway, just curious as to why there would be a 5x 3.84TB SAS SSD Setup?

 Now I want to read from on-prem exchange calendar when that &quot;meeting&quot; is happening and set task scheduler task to execute at that time.
 Anyone had the same case to do and can share some commands? I am guessing it should be possible with power shell to read the meeting information and then use that information to update each task scheduler task. Thanks.

                              <span>Anybody have black and white laser printer recommendations? 
 We used to run all HP printers. Recently we have picked up some Epson color printers. I had no issues with the m401n printers, they run and use off brand ink.
 I need to buy some new ones, I see the HP 4001n is a replacement. The reviews aren&#x27;t great, and I have been unhappy with the newer HP LaserJet printers requiring HP ink (404dn).
 This specific use case is printing AP bills and reports, all black and white, medium volume. A few hundred pages once or twice a week. ethernet connection is preferred in our environment. 500-700 range preferred price. As far as size goes the 401n fits perfectly on his desk.
 Does anybody have anything they like?

                              <span>I was trying to help a user who has a Synology DS920+ 4-bay NAS, populated with 3 HDDs and configured using SHR1 (Synology’s Hybrid RAID with 1 disk redundancy), with an alert he was getting. The reason for the alert was that mdstat was showing &quot;UUU_&quot;, which normally means that the 4th slot has a failed disk. 
 After reading a bit, I thought that perhaps he should remove that 4th disk from the array, but he didn&#x27;t want to do that, so instead he&#x27;ll just disable the alert. The full conversation is [here](https://community.netdata.cloud/t/critical-mdstat-disks-alert-on-4-bay-synology-nas-with-3-drives-shr1/3387). What do you think? Is it ok for mdstat to be showing a failed disk that&#x27;s just not there and will never be there?

 So, 5 for 5 on customers that after turning on exchange archiving, that archive is not visible within their Outlook Desktop application unless I create a new mail profile. 
 Is it possible to get the In-Place archiving from exchange to show up without creating a new mail profile?

                              <span>Hey all
 I am a developer and manage a few IIS servers serving mostly ASP.net classic and core web applications. I am bombarded by probing hits to various attacks. Like someone incessantly hitting /xmlrpc.php or /wordpress/wp-includes/wlwmanifest.xml, neither which are a feature supported on the server. They are mostly Asia or RIPE hits. I cannot do geo blocking as I do allow access to many of these countries. 
 I use a product called RDPguard that intercepts attempts to RDP, FTP and other services and bans IPs via Windows firewall for n hours when they fail out. I am wondering, is there a means via a module or small addin to do something like this but only for IIS 403/404 requests that fail? One IP has hit that wordpress URL 80 times before failing out, only to try again an hour later. Obviously I added their IP to a deny list but they will just come back on another stolen IP or proxy later.
 I realize I can use IIS to deny patterns, but the 404 handler is doing that already. I want to block that IP if possible on the 10&#x27;th time for 4 hours. 
 Ideally I would set up 10 or so common strings I am seeing in logs. Some are even just basic SQL injection phrases, like a select * in the query string. I don&#x27;t want to implement a full IPS just yet.

                              <span>Good Afternoon all
 ​
 I have under my care a Windows Server 2019 Standard, V1809, OS Build 17763.3532
 It&#x27;s main purpose is Backup
 It Runs Veeam Backup and Replication.
 ​
 It is Directly connected to a cluster of ISCSI Switches. a 10GB connection into either one and setup with Nic Teaming for the two 10GB Nic&#x27;s
 We have also tried this with just the singular 10gb with no Teaming and experience the same issues.
 ​
 Now onto my issue
 ​
 Randomly we have a major ISCSI failure which results in a total network loss which results in failed backups.
 I have attempted to get support from Veeam But as far as they are concerned its an infrastructure issue and not their problem to deal with.
 ​
 ​
 Now onto my issue
 It all starts with an error IScsiPrt Error 20 in eventviewer
 then we get in mixed order Event ID - 129,9,39,27,63,43,10
 ​
 In Eventviewer i see those Event ID&#x27;s in no particular order and often 9 repeats a few times in a row.
 what this represents physically is a total network loss 
 ​
 After a few Hrs systems seem to stabilise the errors stop and the network re-establishes
 and backup pick up where they left off.
 ​
 We do eventually have successful backups
 ​
 This issue occurs at what appears to be random to me (i cannot find a solid item to pinpoint the start of this issue from)
 I am at the end of my tether, have attempted every fix i could find, including registry edits and as men&#x3D;tioned above adding a secondary 10Gb Nic.
 ​
 But the issue keeps re-occuring
 Please help

                              <span>Hoping to get a second set of eyes to make sure I&#x27;m not overlooking something obvious on this one (likely). I did reach out to my vendor, but they weren&#x27;t really much help.
 ​
 A user of mine appears to have had their mailbox compromised. It was then used to communicate with their accountant to request etransfers be made. The email itself was very poorly crafted and shouldn&#x27;t have fooled a 6 year old, and it was even filtered to spam. My concern though is making sure I&#x27;m reading the logs correctly and making sure any security holes I stupidly left open get closed, so it doesn&#x27;t happen again.
 ​
 The mailbox had a randomized password with enforced MFA and no app passwords in use. These measures were in place before the supposed compromise happened.
 There are no secondary SPF records that would be allowing sending from another source (website, mail service, etc).
 If I do a message trace on the sender&#x27;s mailbox, the message shows up. The sending mail server is a godaddy address.
 There are no send connectors, custom user mailbox rules, etc in place and I&#x27;ve confirmed there&#x27;s no delegate/send as access for the account.
 ​
 ​
 TLDR: I&#x27;m positive I&#x27;m overlooking something basic here. Would I just be sleepily misreading the logs and it&#x27;s a junk spoofing attempt which is why it would have initially been filtered in spam? I haven&#x27;t dug into 365 logs much in the past but had assumed unauthenticated mail wouldn&#x27;t be showing in a user&#x27;s message trace.

                              <span>Hello all, 
 Hope y&#x27;all are having a nice Monday so far.
 ​
 Question.... I am currently implementing a new Client Authentication template that will be configured to use Autoenrollment in order to get deployed to client machines.
 ​
 This new template in question, I have also decided to configure Template Supersedence. I have added 2-3 templates that I want this certificate to supersede. 
 ​
 After logging into a test machine that has older certificates deployed in it&#x27;s store, I do receive the new template and it also removes the older certificate as is expected with the supersedence.
 ​
 Now, here comes the million dollar question. If my machine was provisoned using Autopilot and this process installs a certificate using SCEP, would this certificate also get removed from the machine if the template is configured as a superseded template?
 ​
 Reason I am asking is that this scep certificate doesn&#x27;t seem to be removed when I log on to the machine. I&#x27;m wondering why. The only difference with other certificates was the method by which it was deployed (Configuration Profile instead of Autoenrollment through group policy).

                              <span>We use the RDP desktop shortcut with single sign-on to allow logged-in users to simply log in to the remote server without entering the password again. It worked like a charm for years.
 I&#x27;ve been scratching my head all morning and found that some users are greeted with a &quot;The user name or password is incorrect. Try Again.&quot; as soon as the remote session window opens. Followed by weird logs in the event viewer.
 Apparently, it&#x27;s been happening since last week, but not many users complained. When we investigated this issue today, we found several other users have the same issue, and they all had KB5018410 installed, and those that didn&#x27;t have this issue didn&#x27;t have the update installed. We uninstalled this update from the affected machines, and everything started working again!
 We do use RDS Farm with UDP, so not sure if it&#x27;s related.
 Thanks again, Microsoft!

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m ordered a latitude 7430 and want to add WWAN.
 It offers my two options
  
 X20 LTE-A (DW5821e) with eSIM
  X20 LTE-A (DW5821e) without eSIM
  
They are both the same price.
 Why would I choose the &quot;without eSIM&quot; variant? Does the &quot;with eSIM&quot; variant no support regular SIMs as well?
 To add confusion, I have found DW5821e chips only that mention &quot;eSIM only&quot;. I can&#x27;t imagine this is true but still... very confusing
 Thanks.

 ​
 We recently had a user google search for &quot;zoom download&quot; and click one of those ad links in the search results and not the official site.
 This then downloaded zoom but it also came with some adware that triggered our security system (ATP)
 We have applocker in place that should of blocked this in the first place, and that is being investigated as to why.
 We also have zoom in our software center
 ​
 But I want to block all these ads. They are never helpful.
 In the consumer world I would just say use ublock origin.
 But is there any sort of policies we can use to block these or has anyone else done anything about these potentially harmful ads.
 I could block the links in our proxy but they are probably changing all the time (doing it for this one anyway

 It does it for all PDFs. If I open the PDF in any other app it works, but I have users that don&#x27;t like going through extra steps to get it opened.
 I have walked through this thread, and these fixes don&#x27;t seem to work: https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/msteams/forum/all/pdf-data-doesnt-show-when-viewing-in-ms-teams/e0261623-a79e-4e58-9002-31265546c5e0
 I also can&#x27;t find any other documentation of this error. Is there a way to rebuild a Teams profile, or mitigate this?

 ​
 My client asked me to subscribe to GW for their domain. We want to keep MS365 including the email. They would like the GW for collaboration, which I understand. 
 When I tried to sign up, the sales person suggested Enterprise Essentials - giving us 2TB of user storage. (I cannot find the web page for the product!) It offers the most space without email. 
 Apparently to buy Business Plus we have to set it up on a different domain. No problem, however, my question is if we can set it up and get it to work well without the email component.
 ​
 Any help/advice is much appreciated.
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>Morning all, so here&#x27;s the backstory- my company has old Cisco Ironport appliances that need to go, and we&#x27;ve been trying to migrate to a CASB, but since our default route and proxy no longer sit in the same path, we&#x27;ve been having problem after problem with misdirected non-proxy-aware traffic.
 I can narrow down our list of suspects by running Wireshark captures while correlating local ports to process IDs with TCPview, which is fine on my own machines, but not really feasible with impacted clients who we&#x27;re pulling out of their production work to run test cases for us.
 The sticking point is preserving the list of PIDs and correlating to source ports. I can get the PIDs from tasklist, but that&#x27;s just a single point in time. I can get the PID to local port linkage from netstat, but that&#x27;s also just a single point in time. I could enable process auditing, but our Security event logs already roll over too fast to scope troubleshooting across a full day because of file auditing (Splunk is tightly controlled with a formal change process, so that&#x27;s out for stretching the log storage in any kind of timely fashion).
 I&#x27;m aware I may be able to catch this in ETL format, but my ETW game is weak and limited to: pktmon capture &gt; pktmon etl2pcap &gt; read in Wireshark; I have no experience at all with collecting app data in ETL.
 At the end of the day, I&#x27;m just looking for a single tool I can run that can get me these four fields for diagnostic purposes:

                              <span>Hello fellow admins, I have a question for you: a customer of mine is a web hosting business and their clients have lots of VMs. Many VMs have a lot of small disks (16GB) joined in a few LVM volumes. I&#x27;m not confortable with this setup, but perhaps it&#x27;s just me;
 I wonder if there&#x27;s a downside in using many disks vs growing an existing one and modifying the partition table. Apparently the volume overhead is minimal, so it shouldn&#x27;t be an issue. What do you think?

 User -- [user.lastname@domain.com](mailto:user.lastname@domain.com)
 Request: please make an email address [lastname@domain.com](mailto:lastname@domain.com) so that a 3rd party can send emails, and provide them the login credentials.
 ​
 Afaik there should be a more easier way then this? (e.g. ask for their static IP at the very least and they can use their in-house email server to send emails to/from)

                              <span>So I&#x27;m working with a vendor and they have their SMTP system where they input the normal settings for SMTP. It keeps failing in their system (Says check credentials, even though I&#x27;m 100% sure it&#x27;s not the credentials), I thought it was their system because when I use the website below, it works fine and sends me an email using the SMTP information I provide. Also, we use SMTP for scan to email on printers for this same account which also works fine. So I know for a fact SMTP is working correctly for this account that we are testing.
 https://dnschecker.org/smtp-test-tool.php
 Settings used:
 SMTP SERVER: smtp.office365.com
 Port: 587
 Email From: Scanner@G**********.com
 Email to: (Myself)
 Use Secured Connection enabled
 Use Authentication enabled
 username: Scanner@G**********.com
 Password: (Scanner&#x27;s Password)
 Outcome: Success
 ​
 However, I just checked a different tool, using the exact same settings and it&#x27;s failing on the below website that requires the exact same information.
 https://www.gmass.co/smtp-test
 Settings used:
 SMTP SERVER: smtp.office365.com
 Port: 587
 Email From: Scanner@G**********.com
 Email to: (Myself)
 Use Secured Connection enabled
 Use Authentication enabled
 username: Scanner@G**********.com
 Password: (Scanner&#x27;s Password)
 Outcome: Failed
 ​
 Anyone know why SMTP would work for somethings but not others? I would expect as long as it&#x27;s using the same Port. server, security and username information it would work if it&#x27;s working for other SMTP tools.

 I have setup 2 x VLANs on the Draytek router (Office &amp; Guest) assigmed them to the ports. Then i have added the VLANs to the UniFi AP &amp; Switch thats all fine. 
 However the UniFi APs and switch are getting VLAN10 IPs and wondering if i should have them on a Management VLAN for best practise? Or is it ok to keep them on here as its the business network? It&#x27;s only a very small 5 user setup

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 I need some input for a new issue in our company. We have a small hand full of new Business Consultants that have Laptops that are offline in AD for sometimes up to 3-4 Months.
 I am very keen on keeping the AD clean, and usualy clients that are offline for over 2 Months get deactivated. 
 My question is, is there a best practice way of handling those kind of clients in AD to prevent accidental deletion and or other Input on how to manage clients like this.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi guys,
 we are a medium sized dev company. As of today, any application is developed in our own tenant. Devs are able to register new apps, grant (most) delegated permissions and start hacking away (loosely speaking).
 There are a couple of issues I see with that approach:
  
Apps grant permissions to production data.
 Bugs or misuse can lead to data loss.
 App credential stealing can lead to data loss and leaks.
 Registering enterprise apps can lead to data leaks.
  
For that reason, I&#x27;d wish that development is out-sourced to a non-production tenant. Or better: Each project gets their own tenant. We have a couple of dozen parallel projects and this could prevent teams getting in each others way - even if that would be only by accident.
 There are currently two ways I can imagine how this works:
  
For every new project, a standalone tenant must be registered. If licenses are needed, they must buy-in. Ideally, this is managed completely separate from IT e.g., by the project manager or a designated tenant-owner. They manage the tenant registration, credit-card info and payments, licensing. We have a devops-department, maybe also they could take over dev-tenant management company-wide.
 For every new project, a M365 developer subscription sandbox is registered. The upside to this is that it is batteries-included with licensing and sample data in most used areas like EXO and SP. The downside is that this tenant is linked to a person in the company, who may leave the company at any point in time. (Now that I think of it, we could use service accounts to have this not linked to real people.)
  
I imagine that this tenant should not be managed by IT at all. The project members are responsible for security, compliance and data privacy.
 How are you guys managing this kind of stuff? Are there other solutions I have not thought of yet?

                              <span>I have inherited the responsibility for maintaining the IT side of a very small 4 people startup as the lead guy has become permanently ill. Neither he nor I have tons of experience. Today a server rebooted and when it came up again the SQL server was down due to expired evaluation as I found out, when reviewing the logs.
 Turns out the reason for not having a license was that it was too expensive for us, but as long as the DB was &gt;10GB it shouldn&#x27;t be a problem I was told, but tuns out that only applies if you use the express version. We only need this particular server for 1.5 months more before it will be taken down anyway.
 Is it possible to migrate the db from the standard edition to the express? I also read an article saying that I can turn back the clock on the server, but I fear that may lead to complications with other systems, though that would be an easy solution given we only need it for 6 more weeks.
 I am frankly a little out of my depth here. I&#x27;m good at figuring stuff out by furiously googling and never giving up and I have worked as a junior sysadmin for two years and have been dabbling with homelabs etc for many years. I&#x27;m decent with networking and Linux, but I have not worked much at all with SQL, especially not MS SQL. 
 Could I buy a license for just two months perhaps? Please help, this is a production system.
 What should I do?

                              <span>Dear,
 I need your help in connecting to a SQL server remotely. The SQL server is not in our subnet but outside our network, but in same country.
 I allowed the SQL port 1433 in firewall and also in DATABASE server properties, in connection, enabled remote connection.
 Is it possible to connect to a SQL server database remotely using MS SQL Server Management Studio?
 Thank you all in advance.

                              <span>We are on a major quest to eliminate paper, moving all documentation to digital only.
 We are looking for electronic document signing solutions, we need to cover two scenarios:
  
About 30 people work with external entities - NDAs, quality certificates etc. Very low frequency of use, one or two per user per month. Something similar to DocuSign. 
 
About 150 people internal use only - to establish formal traceability in various internal process documents. High frequency of use, up to several dozen per day.
 
 DocuSign and other similar products rack up costs exceedingly fast.
 Can anyone suggest more economical solutions? We can live with two different products for external and internal use if there is a cost benefit.
 Thanks

 How would I go about finding this information? 
 Our organisation is a work from home organisation with no on premise network or servers. We are all using O365.
 Also, what would be the method to find out our IP address ranges if we WERE an on premise company with a network and servers? 
 Thank you

 Basically I want to know what information can be retrieved from stealing my Chrome data profile folder and if it is useful to him, and in what matter

                              <span>I am currently setting up several services that we will be having users log into using LDAP over TLS so I am setting up HTTPS through Caddy reverse proxy. In an ideal setting I would set up a Linux server with Nginx Proxy Manager to do this but I have been denied from setting up a Linux VM on our network. Our contracted network engineer has refused to have a Linux VM or an Internal CA on our network to make this project work according to any documentation I find online.
 He has provided me with a third-party wildcard certificate for our domain and has set up a Windows Server 2016 for me to use for the project. Is there any way for me to specify the wildcard certificate in the CaddyFile to be used for each reverse proxy without needing to declare a DNS challenge as according to the documentation. I currently have it creating local certificates with Caddy&#x27;s internal CA but it will still give a warning to end users and most will not know how to allow exceptions.
 As I am new to using Caddy and failed miserably trying to set up a reverse proxy through IIS any suggestions would be appreciated.

 I&#x27;ve been researching email hosting providers since I don&#x27;t want to manage it myself and all of them charge by the user and since the number of employees change I want to get a high number of possible account if not unlimited.
 I&#x27;m also managing some cPanel websites and I&#x27;ve noticed that they have high or unlimited number of mail accounts for the fraction of the cost of a pure email provider. How does that work?
 What are my options of adding email taking into consideration existing VPS?

 Depending on my sleep or coffee levels, it&#x27;s either amusing or infuriating the sort of things I see because DMARC. I&#x27;ll ignore everything else for now, this is just DMARC.
 Common, daily occurrences include:
  
Sending DMARC reports for received DMARC reports
 Receiving a &quot;mailbox full&quot; error for dmarc@some-idiot.com
 Receiving a &quot;message rejected by spam filter&quot; because the message attachment contains blacklisted IPs. Huh I wonder why those are there
 Receiving a &quot;mailbox does not exist&quot; error, because reasons.
  
And my new, personal favorite: 
 &quot;INEPT-COMPANY Request received - Report Domain: inept-company.com Submitter: dmarc-sender.com Report-ID: inept-company.com.1665896400.1665982800&quot;
 That&#x27;s right, their DMARC address is listed as support@ which is their Zendesk address. So any DMARC reports sent are going to end up automatically creating a ticket!
 I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s worse, their ineptitude at understanding how to setup a mailbox to take a set of messages every day, or how their support team feels dealing with the daily ticket influx of a completely automated and unactionable message.

                              <span>Hey all,
 ​
 Been bashing my head against a wall on this one. I am renewing an SSL cert for my RDGateway server. Done it plenty of times, never an issue. This one, however, when I apply the cert users can&#x27;t login and event log shows 0xC000035B. Replace the new cert with the original one (not due to expire for a few more days), and all good again.
 I figured it might be the cert (somehow), so I tried adding our wildcard cert to the RD Gateway instead. Sure enough, same error. Put the original rds.domain .com cert back in, it works.
 I found various articles suggesting setting EnforceChannelBinding to 0 (via regedit) on the RDG server, which out of curiosity I&#x27;ve done - no difference. I also set LMCompatibilityLevel on my PC to 3, no good. No other posts I&#x27;ve found so far that have to do with that error code have much else info i&#x27;m afraid.
 Has anyone else ever seen a new SSL cert cause users to fail logging in? Or does anyone have any ideas where to start looking? Nothing has changed server-side other than the cert, and besides - you&#x27;d think if it had, the old cert would have broken... Thanks in advance!
 ​
 EDIT: The only thing different from the last time is that there&#x27;s a new firewall in that does HTTPS inspection (or something along those lines, it&#x27;s managed by a 3rd-party). I&#x27;m reaching out to them, in case it&#x27;s the difference in SSL certs causing this, but does that sound likely to anyone else? (i&#x27;m fairly new to HTTPS inspection sorry)

                              <span>Hi folks!
 I&#x27;m in the process of deploying a new 2-tier PKI so will consist of a Root CA and subordinate CA. I&#x27;ve done plenty of research around recommended validity periods for Root CA and subordinate CA - however I&#x27;ve recently read up on the Y2038 bug.
 The idea was to deploy the new Root CA with a validity period of 20 years and then the subordinate for half of that period however this will take the expiry date past the year 2038 - I&#x27;m just curious how is everyone else dealing with this bug - are you deploying CA certificate with a date prior to this date?
 Reading the bug it only seems to effect legacy systems that use 32bit integer for the time.
 Just curious how y&#x27;all are working around this!
 Thanks

 Ive seen Microsoft azure certifications from fundamentals ,associate, specialty and expert
 Would it be in my best interest to start with Azure or go directly to AWS?
 Im currently looking to level up my linux skills above A+ material.
 Any suggestions are welcome!

                              <span>I still get slammed with e-mails, phone calls and LinkedIn messages from recruiters with some pretty high quality jobs and with good pay. I&#x27;m not an architect either. I have also noticed that it seems to be really hard to find people who can actually get the job done. The last few companies I&#x27;ve worked for and the one now all keep cycling through tons of people who lack the skills. 
 ​
 Is this a trend? Is this just the area I live in?

                              <span>Hello guys,
 we are a fairly large organization with a couple of small offices around the world.
 For example we have an office in Tokyo with approx a dozen users. We have a small vSphere platform there which we want to dismantle and go serverless. We have already two EC2 DCs in the AWS Frankfurt region (they are an extention of our on-prem AD).
 Something I&#x27;m wondering, we also have offices in Singapore, Manila, Seoul and a few more in the region. So I believe it may make sense to use a single region (Singapore ?) to serve all these regions ?
 I&#x27;m curious as to what kind of best practice analysis and implementation (if one exists) I should follow for this kind of implementation. Has anyone gone through this before ? Just trying to see if there is a known practice I should follow.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>More of a best practice check than an issue; Through the years I&#x27;ve noticed a decline in use of the Netlogon share. We&#x27;ve stopped using the Logon script user attribute in AD (instead using User context GPOs) and installers are normally stored on a different file share due to file size. I&#x27;m struggling to think what use this share has, but want to ensure I&#x27;m not missing a trick.
 Thoughts? Every scenario I think of seems better via GPO.

                              <span>In the old days you could remove the battery and the laptop would run just fine from the mains. However, these days most of them are integrated. 
 I’ve noticed with my work Dell, that when under heavy load, it drains from the battery as well as the mains. At first I thought there was something wrong with it, but apparently this is normal for modern laptops and makes sense as it saves on money for the manufacturer as they can use a weaker power supply and regulators. 
 In addition, I’ve noticed that if the battery dies completely, the laptop won’t switch back on for five or so minutes until the battery has charged a bit even though the power cable is plugged in - just like a flat phone…
 So is the battery now essential? I’m asking partly because I wonder what will happen to certain laptops in a few years once the battery is fully aged and useless.

I know what a San is and I know the basics of nutanixs as a file system and how you use prism to control it but I don&#x27;t quite get the pros and cons. Would anyone be willing to offer a breakdown?

                              <span>I&#x27;m doing some weekend work for a second school district and I&#x27;ve been getting complaints about staff not being able to pull up certain videos falling under restricted. I have the staff OU set to be able to verify and approve restricted content and in chrome device policies I have restricted mode disabled for the staff OU as well.
 It works fine in Edge and when I pull the policies JSON it seems to be flagged as a machine policy override, but I can&#x27;t seem to find a toggle for it, assuming it&#x27;s some Chrome browser specific setting but I&#x27;m not finding anything under Chrome device policies.
  &quot;ForceYouTubeRestrict&quot;: { &quot;conflicts&quot;: [ { &quot;level&quot;: &quot;mandatory&quot;, &quot;scope&quot;: &quot;user&quot;, &quot;source&quot;: &quot;cloud&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: 0 } ], &quot;level&quot;: &quot;mandatory&quot;, &quot;scope&quot;: &quot;machine&quot;, &quot;source&quot;: &quot;cloud&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: 2, &quot;warning&quot;: &quot;This policy is working as intended but a conflicting value is set elsewhere and is overridden by this policy.&quot; }, 
 Any ideas?
 Edit: From what I can see it&#x27;s doing at the level of the Chrome application as an HTTP header restriction to the individual machine/browser, going into a guest mode in the browser continues to apply the policy, and I can see the policy is being applied at the machine level in the admin console, but not where the policy is coming from...
 Edit: Changed machine policy at root level to allow, and at student level to disable, which resolved the issue. For some reason it was prioritizing/inheriting the root level machine policy instead of overriding it.

                              <span>Before I describe the problem everyone will probably be happy to know that I&#x27;ve already told them to change the hostname of Device B and to never talk to be about this again. But I have a bug up my butt because I should be able to detect where this is coming from, but so far I can&#x27;t.
 My company writes custom applications that create custom problems. Today&#x27;s problem is that something is creating dynamic DNS entries on our DNS server on behalf of another device, and the DNS entry it is creating has an IP that conflicts with another device on the network.
 Device A is a Windows 10 PC with IP 192.168.1.100 and hostname Device-A. Device B is some embedded device with IP 192.168.1.200 and hostname Device-A. That&#x27;s right, duplicate hostname. So the DNS entry for Device A gets over-written with the 192.168.1.200 address and then they can&#x27;t reach Device A on the network.
 The problem is that it isn&#x27;t Device B that is creating the entries on the DNS server. We turned Device B off for 24 hours and something still was creating the DNS entry, but I can&#x27;t find what is doing that. I&#x27;ve run Wireshark captures, Microsoft Network Monitor captures, ProcMon captures, and checked the DNS-Server Audit log in Event Viewer. I can see plenty of entries of Active Directory dynamic updates, arp/LLMNR/NBNS/MDNS queries and responses, SMB advertisements, but none of them are for Device B that I&#x27;m looking for. 
 Clearly the problem is that I don&#x27;t have a deep enough understanding of the mechanisms behind this behavior. So I&#x27;m hoping someone can throw some terms my way that I can Google and read up on. Or some articles that describe what&#x27;s going on. I&#x27;ve been doing some Google searches but I&#x27;m only finding generic articles/tutorials that don&#x27;t give any insight into what I&#x27;m looking for.
 Thanks in advance for any info you can send my way!
 Edit: Both devices have static IPs configured, no DHCP is involved.

                              <span>Hi All, 
 TL;DR: What are the real MFA triggers for Azure Security Defaults? Is it sufficient for SMB?
 Ages ago I read up on Azure security defaults (link on bottom), and it appeared to only register users for authentication methods, but it did not enforce MFA use for users, instead only admins. 
 Shortly after the announcement - it appeared that they added a &quot;smart tracking&quot; (per se) that would have users use MGA when it is necessary. 
 With that in mind, does anyone know the exact rules to when users will need to reauthenticate?
 Is this sufficient for SMBs (less than 30 users), or should I use per-user MFA/force upgrades to licensing for Conditional Access?
 I understand that there are many factors, but I would like to understand more in depth. Through testing, I have confirmed that new IPs trigger MFA, but I want to be sure that after some time it get&#x27;s triggered again.

                              <span>I had some issues with my Veeam Backup Jobs and and I stopped them on the Veeam Console. The backup was getting performed on one of my Virtual Machines and it appeared offline due to not having any more space (which was due to the Veeam Backup snapshot) so I stopped all Veeam Services on the console and Removed the Snapshot manually (VM &gt; Snapshot Manager &gt; Remove Snapshot) and now when I power on the server (W2019) it gets to the Windows Icon and the little spinny icon just keeps going round and round and round, been doing it for the past 30 mins.
 I appear to have a backup of this machine from Yesterday so I&#x27;m unsure if i should do a Full Restore or just restore the Virtual Disks from Veeam Console.
 What do people suggest?

                              <span>I’ve been tasked with rebooting servers every 30 days to keep environment healthy and we have servers with massive high uptimes so we’ve started with those servers first but I feel like this will be never ending battle has anyone else in this subreddit experienced this?
 Other questions I have about rebooting servers for example how would even start to reboot Hyper-V servers, VMware servers, Application servers and Exchange servers? Does Microsoft Docs or FANG companies have any processes to manage these tasks efficiently?

                              <span>Hi all,
 Two Domain Controllers. Both 2016, say A and B. B is relatively new.
 Using our VPN appliance and AD authentication, if the VPN connects to A, it will allow users on, it will allow the users connect and read the users group membership.
 If A is down and B is up, the VPN will connect to B but return wrong credentials for the user 
 There&#x27;s no error messages in DCdiag for both. Repadmin is fine.
 I can setup a user in AD, shut down DC A and can log the brand new user onto a new laptop and it will show their logon server is B.
 I have a ticket with the VPN vendor, but still feel something must be up with B. Just can&#x27;t think of any troubleshooting. Any ideas? Or any way to test the user with flow or get logs?

                              <span>So I&#x27;m building an AD tiered access model and using the &quot;Deny logon on...&quot; User Rights Assignment GPO&#x27;s. However most guides talk about how you need to include all the users of the other tiers in the deny policy. For instance for the T0 GPO you need to deny T1 and T2 users.
 However, I wanted to reverse this logic. I would like to deny access to ALL users and exclude the current tier users only. Tried doing this by denying all authenticated users and changing the GPO&#x27;s permission of &quot;Apply group policy&quot; to deny the GPO being applied to the T0 users. But, since the GPO is a computer policy it won&#x27;t do much to deny users from the GPO. 
 Is there another way to handle this logic of having denied logon access to everyone except some group?

 What are the tools you must have with you at all times? I am pretty nomadic with my IT tool-set. I typically have my laptop backpack that contains all sorts of items. Some to share are:
 iFixIt screw drivers, rechargeable battery pack, Ethernet cables, HDMI cable, USB-C Hub with Ethernet adapter, USB drives. I have some other cables too and carry an inverter in my car. 
 What do you all keep with you? Or are must haves in your department?

                              <span>Currently have a background w/ 4 years in some type of system administrator roles. I have about more than 1 year in an Cloud Analyst/engineering position but want to be able to get experience to use for a Solutions Architect role. Currently troubleshoot a variety of servers, Azure, as well as administer O365 all around in my current role but feel like a growth track at this point is needed. Is there any sys admins or architects that have worked their way to this role and if so what or how did you do it? Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been tasked by my new job to implement some power apps governance.
 It looks like its been halfway setup 
 -we have a CoE environment
 -microsoft Flow is under the solutions
 -we have a service account as the creator of half the flows (other flows are the ex-employee that set it up a few months ago)
 -I cannot see any of the flows from the ex-employee, it errors out
 ​
 I do not think anything is actively running in the CoE environment. I ran an audit on the service account to see if its actually doing anything and nothing came up.
 I want to redo the entire environment, as it seems the CoE governance apps have updated since that time the user implemented it. It also was halfway finished, with some of the crucial flows belonging to the ex-employee that it used to belong to.
 ​
 That being said, has anyone ran into this or setup something similar? If I reset the password on the service account via AAD, will anything break? I need to log into it to set up our CoE environment from scratch as this current one is a mess.

                              <span>Our users have to enter the company domain when Adobe asks for their email address, which then takes them to our company&#x27;s MFA page to sign in with their credentials. I explain this to everyone during their onboarding, but it doesn&#x27;t always stick, and users enter their email when prompted (can&#x27;t blame them) and inadvertently sign in to a personal account.
 Is there any way to prefill the domain? Or can I change the Adobe login page background image to include instructions on signing in?

                              <span>I posted this to the CCNP subreddit but got no response, hope it&#x27;s okay to ask here.
 I&#x27;m reading the OCG CCNP book and I&#x27;m a little confused at its explanation of how BPDU filter works when enabled globally. Here&#x27;s what it says:
 &quot;The global BPDU filter configuration uses the command spanning-tree portfast bpdufilter default, and the port sends a series of 10 to 12 BPDUs. If the switch receives any BPDUs, it checks to identify which switch is more preferred.
 ■ The preferred switch does not process any BPDUs that it receives, but it still transmits BPDUs to inferior downstream switches.
 ■ A switch that is not the preferred switch processes BPDUs that are received, but it does not transmit BPDUs to the superior upstream switch&quot;
 My understanding is that when BPDU filter is configured globally it applies to all portfast ports and if a port receives a BPDU it converts to a regular STP port. Applied at the interface and it basically stops the port from participating in STP. 
 I feel like it&#x27;s just explaining regular STP operation but I&#x27;m confused by the wording.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently working on a project where I need to provide network connectivity to a VDI cloud. Currently the network utilizes Auto QoS at the access switch level for the end users. It is recommended to mark the traffic DSCP AF41. I am not sure if Auto QoS will mark this traffic appropriately or if I need to create a custom class-map/policy-map. I need some clarification on this statement in the 9300 documentation
 &quot; After auto-QoS is enabled, do not modify a policy map or aggregate policer that includes AutoQoS in its name. If you need to modify the policy map or aggregate policer, make a copy of it, and change the copied policy map or policer. To use the new policy map instead of the generated one, remove the generated policy map from the interface, and apply the new policy map. &quot; - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst9500/software/release/17-3/command_reference/b_173_9500_cr/qos_commands.htm
 So is this saying copy the Auto QoS policy and create a duplicate with my custom class-maps then disable Auto QoS and apply to the interface?
 I am very weak in this area, any help is much appreciative.

                              <span>Hello all, I’m am currently in a search for a solid telecom network design software for our company. The goal is to both have Engineering use the software to design network changes, but also provide inventory and device management functionality for our Operations team. We have a diverse network so we need to be able to view both fiber cable routes and MW hops on a map. Any ideas? I just came across a free software called Kuwaiba, but we’ll likely be able to pay for a solid software if it’s more capable than Kuwaiba.

                              <span>There is currently a rule on the Cisco ASA 5555 that allows HTTPS traffic to the FQDN xyz.com (example) for server. The connection once works and once does not work. I was able to determine that the public FQDN resolves to a lot of public IPs from different subnets. The ASA does not always have the IP address in the DNS cache to which the FQDN on the server was resolved. Server and the ASA have exactly the same DNS server set up. Unfortunately, I am unable to obtain a complete list of the IP addresses of the subnets to which the FQDN is resolved, so traffic needs to be filtered to FQDN. I have noticed that the FQDN on the server changes every 30-40 seconds or so, and on the ASA in the DNS cache I see a TTL for the FQDN of up to 2 minutes. Does anyone have any idea how to solve this so that in the DNS cache on the ASA the FQDN address is always the same as on the server? I know that the server first resolves the FQDN and then with the IP address it gets from DNS it goes to ASA. The ASA must have there the IP address to which the FQDN on the server was resolved.

                              <span>Hi my fellow Gandalf of the networking realm.
 I hope you&#x27;re all have a great Sunday. I was wondering if there&#x27;s a place I can practice/learn how to better write networking documentations? Currently lined up for a position, one of things they&#x27;d want me to do is document the infrastructure.
 Is there a place I can learn technical writing focusing on networking? I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m about average but would like to hone this skill even more. I can already see this skill being extremely valuable in any technical field I go to. It would be a great investment to myself.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working with some network automation over the last while at my organization. The senior tech&#x27;s haven&#x27;t enabled HTTP on any of the network appliances because as far as they&#x27;re concerned, it simply expands the attack surface to yet another port on the device when SSH, NETCONF, and SNMP are open. 
 I&#x27;ve been working with Python and Ansible to script some automated actions and generate reports for certain bits of data, but now I&#x27;m genuinely curious. 
 Ansible has the ability to utilize either netconf (XML via SSH), restapi (HTTP API), or network_cli (CLI via SSH) for its connection method to the devices. In the same vein, I can use Netmiko (CLI via SSH) or NAPALM (HTTP API) when using Python/Nornir.
 Our monitoring tools make extensive use of SNMP. This includes DNAC pushing downstream changes. 
 Q: What are the immediate benefits to enabling HTTP within the direct scope of network automation and API usage? Can it be reasonably boiled down to &quot;aimlessly expanding the attack surface&quot;, or is there tangible benefit that I&#x27;m not seeing?

                              <span>I am looking for a pair of routers to terminate about 2500 L2TP subscriber sessions. Usually I would go for the Cisco ASR1000 as it is a proven workhorse in this area. Now the ASR1000 is EoL and Cisco offers the Catalyst8000 series as successor.
 Has anyone used the Cat8000 as an LNS? Are there any restrictions or caveats
 The router should be integrated as MPLS Edge with IS-IS, MPLS-SR and L3VPN. From the licensing point of view the Network Advantage stack gives all this. Has anyone already gathered experience with this?
 Up to now i never implemented a C8k as plain IOS-XE device.

Maybe some advices and solutions on how to improve the network and also test the improved network to see the differences, different scenarios etc.? Is this too basic?
 Sorry for the dumb question. I really like the idea but I am afraid if it’s too basic and I want to hear what I can do to improve it to the masters level. I am really new to this world.

                              <span>I am beginning to roll out SSL Decrypt on our networks with Palos. I will be using Panorama to slowly integrate this policy, by deploying first on smaller less critical sites and then moving to the bigger/mission critical sites. My question is, is it best practice or could their be any issue with using a single signed certificate that can be deployed from a “global ssl template” to all my firewalls for SSL decryption? That way I just have to keep track of one single renewal date.

 I know that VLANs are known in the 2nd layer meanwhile IP networks are known in the 3rd one.

 If the host has reachability to 10.0.1.1 through the DG, can the packet travel to 10.0.1.1, after which it’s routed to a host on the LAN side of 10.0.1.1 (ex IP 10.0.2.2)

                              <span>How normal is 24/7 on call, no rotation and no plans of having any? I have a job offer which pays 28k more than current position, but requires on call for emergencies, since it is a utility company. I&#x27;m not sure how often emergencies happen, or what they consider an emergency either, but I will clarify in a follow up on Monday.
 I&#x27;m just worried that I will be anxious all the time about answering my work phone when I&#x27;m home. What if I wanted to go see a movie? What if I wanted to go away for a weekend, out of state? I would be a technical specialist meaning I&#x27;m the first line of contact for issues that may arrise. 
 I do not wanna turn down this job, being that the state I live in doesn&#x27;t offer many opportunities like this, but I do not wanna kill my current work-life balance for money.

Problem is that WinPE even with all cab files installed doesn&#x27;t have it. I tried working around that by including all .mof .mfl and .dll files from the webm folder. Then running regsvr32 for all dll files and mofcomp for all mof and mfl files to recompile the wmi library. Then I can find the MDM_DevDetail_Ext01 file with wbemtest, but trying to get the wmiobejct i receive a system.accessviolationexception: attempted to read or write protected memory. I&#x27;m clueless and any idea would be greatly appreciated. Kind Regards

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking into getting remote backup from Veeam to a cloud provider - initially I was thinking just spitting it into AWS Glacier for a &#x27;cheap and cheerful&#x27; off-site backup location, but Wasabi has come out LEAGUES cheaper.
 Has anyone had any experience with them? PayG is $5.99/month with no fees on egress/API requests, and it just seems so suspiciously cheap to me. 
 I intend to backup about 100GB of 365 data via object storage, and then a backup store via a scale out repo... We&#x27;ll be well under 1TB, but still, 5.99 just seems ridiculous? I&#x27;m aware that deletion of anything younger than 90 days will result in a charge; that won&#x27;t be an issue..

                              <span>Originally went to school for full stack - circumstance brought me to networking, after working in the field, I worked as a jr network engineer for a year, I am not currently working in an analyst role at the NOC pursuing my CCNA. So about 3 years now in networking. Im not quite sure networking is where I want to end up so I just obtained my linux essentials cert and now deciding between the LPIC 1 - 3 certification path or the LFCA. In the short term, I would like to get an entry level job as a linux sys admin after some time spent at the NOC, the end game maybe dive into Azure.
 Although my main focus is to set my self up for success after the NOC and get a job working as a sys admin. Which of the two certs would best help me achieve this ? LPIC 1 - 3 or LFCA ?
 thanks

                              <span>Hi all,I&#x27;ve gotten the ok to work from home starting next week(woohoo) with a week WFH and a week in the office.
 I run Fedora 36 on my home PC and I&#x27;ve setup an Alma Linux 8 VM in work that I want to use as a jumpbox to access our systems however I also want all my special keystrokes to go to that VM like the Windows Key, Alt Tab, Ctrl-Shift-Tab etc....
 The connection to the office uses OpenVPN which I keep running in a terminal on my Desktop PC.
 I was thinking that using XDMCP over ssh would be the way to go by starting X in tty2 and connecting that to the VM but also keeping tty1(my current local XFCE4 DE) available to use by jumping between the two.
 Does this sound like a good idea?My aim is to maximize the performance but also for it to be stable. 
 For reference: My Fedora install makes no use of Wayland at all, it started as the absolute minimum install and I opted for X. The reason being that I wanted to try building up the system only with packages I needed as I went along.

 The IT department warned that the costs associated with cloud adoption would not be as significant as is marketed by our chosen CSP. 
 I’m just curious, anyone else experience cloud sticker shock?

The problem is, since I&#x27;ve been happily with one registrar for all these years I&#x27;m out of touch with who are considered to be good bets for holding domains.
 Who do you folks like these days?

                              <span>Preface: I’m by no means a cloud engineer, just someone who has to support cloud infrastructure from time to time. 
 I’ve seen quite a few companies in which majority of the infrastructure is hosted in AWS but are still utilizing services from Microsoft such as Intune, Office 365 suite, AD connect, etc. The companies I work with traditionally have only Windows Servers along with a few custom apps their developers manage and maintain. To me, it seems more rational to host everything in Azure instead of splitting services out between the two platforms. Any ideas on the rational here?
 Edit: I’m aware that there may be cost difference and such but from my experience, Azure and AWS seem fairly similar in regards to pricing and data center locations.

                              <span>A slight rant, but curious how common this is as it’s the first time it has happened to me in 22 years of software purchasing. 
 We had been using a particular piece of software for phishing simulation exercises for 4 years, but when Microsoft introduced their own version of campaigns within 365 admin centre I decided to use that, and not renew the paid product. 
 So, when the renewal hit my inbox some 2 months before the current licence term was up, I told them that I we did not wish to renew. 
 However, they insisted that we were under contract as we hadn’t given them 3 months notice to cancel. I tried speaking to the account manager and even to their legal dept, but they insisted that we pay. I tried to negotiate a smaller termination fee based on us not using it for around 18 months but they wouldn’t budge and finance eventually paid after I had it in writing that it would not auto renew next year. 
 I just found the whole experience really shitty customer service from them and would never recommend them or a company that operates the same.
 //edit. Since a few have asked. The company in question is Metacompliance

 This is maddening for me and anxiety enducing. I had three tasks in 1 hour to do, had about 10-15 each to do them. The first was to write a docker container to make a small python game work. I did it but not the exact way they wanted with the container using CMD to launch the game itself. This wasn&#x27;t for lack of knowledge, this was how my mind functions, I write what feels like it should work, test, iterate, troubleshoot, test, etc. In the end it worked but I had to exec into the container to manually run it. 5 minutes longer or someone not watching me…</span>

 trying to figure out the cabling requirements, it&#x27;s unclear in the quote/BOM if the added HBA/CNA/NIC cards come with SFPs or not. I kind of recall back in the day you had to buy the SFPs separately.
 looking up the parts online through the partner reseller websites, it doesn&#x27;t note what&#x27;s in the box.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 We were recently quoted $950 for 100/100 by a Att rep that came out to our site (they already have preexisting infrastructure in the building). Apparently they cover construction costs as well up to 10K for dedicated lines but not sure what&#x27;s involved. Does this look on par with typical dedicated business fiber rates? If we have a Business Fan account with cellular lines, can you somehow get a package or deal of some sort when adding fiber? I heard there were some sort package deals with fiber, but unsure if it applies to dedicated or just residential. Also, would it be possible to ask them or the 3rd party contractor to lay OS2 single mode cable (vs cat6) as it&#x27;s more future proof? Open to hearing about any issues or pitfalls I may encounter and how best to avoid them during this process.
 Thanks for any advice or insight, appreciate it!

 Purchased used Dell server, none seem to come with COA anymore that i can find. Will also like User Cal Licenses and RDS Licenses.We are working on moving older Physical 2008 servers to Hyper-V, Then getting company off 2008. The few i have found on Ebay look so sketchy to risk a few hundred on.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Just going to go on a little rant here, so pardon my french, but for the love of god and all that is holy, please name your servers, your network infrastructure, hell even your datacenters something logical. 
 So far, in my travails, I have encountered naming conventions centered around:
  
Comic book characters
 Greek/Norse mythology
 Capitals
 Painters
 Biblical characters
 Musical terminology (things like &quot;Crescendo&quot; and &quot;Modulation&quot;)
 Types of rock (think &quot;Graphite&quot; and &quot;Gneiss&quot;)
  
This isn&#x27;t the Da Vinci code, you&#x27;re not adding &quot;depth&quot; by dropping obscure references in your environment. When my external consultant ass walks into your office, it&#x27;s to help you with your problems. I&#x27;m not here to decipher three layers of bullshit to figure out what you mean by saying your Pikachu can&#x27;t connect to your Charizard because Snorlax is down. Obtuse naming conventions like this cost time, focus and therefor money. I get that it adds a little flair to something sterile and &quot;dull&quot;, but it&#x27;s also actively hindering me from doing a good job. 
 Now, as a disclaimer, what you do in the privacy of your own home is not my business. If you want to name your server farm after the Bad Dragon catalog, be my guest, you&#x27;re the god of your domain. But if you&#x27;re setting up an environment to be maintained by a dozen or so people, you have to understand that not everyone will hear &quot;Chance&quot; and think &quot;Domain Controller&quot;.

 I&#x27;m thinking about using it on a small scale to monitor a few remote computers and kinda questioning using it over other solutions like zabbix. Just curious what other people do.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I am looking for a best bang-for-buck solution - be it refurbished or otherwise - of a server for the following uses.
 It can hold hyper-v with 3 x VM&#x27;s. 
 A VM for &quot;us&quot; so basically a jumpbox for our techs to work from (want DC access only when absolutely necessary).
 A VM for basic file backups (to supplement our cloud solution)
 A VM for testing - so if we want to test a login before handing it out, we have a prebuilt vm to test login etc.
 That&#x27;s all, and none of them have to run super speedy or anything.
 Finally, it must be low footprint, to fit into a locked cabinet. It can either be small or a rack mounted item.
 I&#x27;ve literally never used a mini server... so not sure what might fit these needs.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I have been wanting to do this for a long time, One of the things that I am really passionate about is using a data driven approach to save money on Cloud spend. The most rewarding jobs I have undertaken in the past are going into an AWS environment and saving money on cloud spend and optimising the best performance for less money! 
 It&#x27;s a great value add for any organisation. 
 Alot of the organisations spend more on fancy tools to try and save money on Monthly cloud spend which I think is pointless as it often outweighs the cost of the money they try and save. Also I have seen tools that don&#x27;t even check the basics. The data is already there for you in AWS and it&#x27;s simply a case of extrapolating it using a bit of engineering time which you pay for anyway and the result is that you can often save more money! 
 Certainly I have seen it a lot here in Reddit, Cost is becoming ever more prevalent in many AWS environments. 
 Two things to mention, There are copies I will give away for free to those engineers who will agree to read it and implement the savings ideas in their environments and give me feedback and comments, So it would be good to see how much you saved over a month. It would be interesting to gauge feedback. 
 I have to spend a bit of time mentoring Juniors in the past so I know especially at the moment how the job market is. So I will give away free copies to Junior engineers looking for ideas how to break into the market and some handy tips to increase your chances of standing out when going to for an interview. 
 If you feel this is you, Feel free to DM me. 
 Anyway without giving too much away, I have produced a guide for it here.

                              <span>How do you guys handle having a 2FA number between multiple engineers. Currently we all use our own number but this causes issues when you need to cover someone else or if anyone leaves.
 I&#x27;ve tried setting up a SMS to 3CX system but most companies from what I can tell don&#x27;t support shortcodes. I&#x27;m thinking of giving WhatsApp&#x27;s integration with 3CX a go.
 What&#x27;s your solution to having 2FA accessible to everyone?

I hear, and I&#x27;m not sure if this is complete bullshit, that other 24 year olds doing I.T up the city are on about £80,000. Not doing sysadmin but doing programming. Should I jump ship and get into programming whilst I&#x27;m young?
 Where can I expect the salary for a sysadmin to cap off hard? £40,000? £50,000?

 So, I was planning to take off the password on my laptop because my brother will use it so he will not call me every time. I dont know what I did but I managed to change my only account on the laptop to local guest user from administrator. Now, there are things that I cannot access becuase it says it needs the approval of admin.
 Usually there will be a prompt like, &quot;Do you want to allow this app to make changes on your device&quot; and it has an option of &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;, but since there is no admin now, it only has &quot;No&quot;.
 I&#x27;m stupid I know (lol) but i dont know what to do. hahaha. Highly appreciate it if somebody can suggest what I need to do. Thank you :)
 edit: I have the windows 11 now

                              <span>Hey
 I have just done an audit of local accounts on servers and noticed a jdkadmin account on one. Appears to be a full admin on the server.
 Doing a google it could be a java account. According to logging, the jdkadmin account has been there for a few days. This server has an internal only web app on it so could be java related. Also has Firefox on it and Chrome. External access is via reverse proxy in Azure.
 As a precaution, I have changed all domain admin accounts, audited the admin usage accounts, and changed all 30-odd service accounts. Also changed the ADMINISTRATOR accounts and made sure it hasn&#x27;t been used. Also revoked all VPN credentials from third-party support companies and suspended all their accounts just in case.

                              <span>Does anyone know, once the Cisco Umbrella trial period expires does it just stop the filtering or does it stop resolving DNS requests altogether and thus make the internet stop working? I&#x27;m wondering whether to urgently change my DNS settings back to Google&#x27;s DNS, or will my internet still work via Cisco&#x27;s DNS servers after the Umbrella trial expires?
 Many thanks

I already found some, but I need as much as there are. They need to be open source, and at best still active. The work of comparing is hard as it is with the few ones I decided to use for this but need more. Please help me.

 We have traffic being dropped on the firewall due to tcp packet out of state. Below is what can be seen in the logs. May I know what might be the reason for this? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 We were recently quoted $950 for 100/100 by a Att rep that came out to our site (they already have preexisting infrastructure in the building). Apparently they cover construction costs as well up to 10K for dedicated lines but not sure what&#x27;s involved. Does this look on par with typical dedicated business fiber rates? If we have a Business Fan account with cellular lines, can you somehow get a package or deal of some sort when adding fiber? I heard there were some sort package deals with fiber, but unsure if it applies to dedicated or just residential. Also, would it be possible to ask them or the 3rd party contractor to lay OS2 single mode cable (vs cat6) as it&#x27;s more future proof? Open to hearing about any issues or pitfalls I may encounter and how best to avoid them during this process.
 Thanks for any advice or insight, appreciate it!

                              <span>Looking for around 20 access switches, 1 core and 1 firewall. Each switch will have less than 5 hosts. --the network is for light usage, like logs monitoring --light traffic usage, sub 1 gig --the vendor has to be easily managed and good support. --PoE not required.
 Im leaning towards cisco, possibly meraki. Or should i go with cheaper options like netgear, are they enterprise grade? What do you guys think?

                              <span>The company I&#x27;m working for is an ISP owning a small fibre network. We use GPON to rent internet accesses to private customers. As we are expanding our network we need to automate the provisioning of the devices to keep up with the workload.
 I&#x27;ve created a small proof of concept using netbox as a single source of truth and Ansible running on AWX as our automation controller. This is suboptimal as there is no Ansible role/collection for the Nokia ISAM FD series. Developing one would mean substantial costs in allocated engineering time.
 Before commiting to this model I&#x27;d like to know what automation concepts you folks use in your networks. Have you got multi / single vendor concepts, what software do you use, how do you handle (legacy) devices which are not supported by the automation software? Do you use monolithic or vendor specific solutions or do you use a stack of different solutions communicating by API? If possible please put the model in context of how many devices are automated, and how large the supporting team is. 
 Many thanks!!

 What i have to do is change the DHCP settings for another IP and i am back again with the network if i restart my router now will face the same issue.

                              <span>We’ve made a rule to never allow unmanaged dumb switches at our office. But people keep bringing their home bought sh*t to our network environment.
 We have 802.1X enabled and I’ve read that you shouldn’t use that together with MAC port-security since it may cause other issues.
 What is the best and simplest way to get rid of unmanaged switches that doesn’t talk STP?
 Might I add, we use Catalyst 9200/9300 mainly with some 2960x here and there.

                              <span>Long story short, we can&#x27;t prove it but we think one of our missing computers went home with a staff member during covid and stayed there. We have not seen it on the network but they may still be using it for office products like outlook and teams. Can we get any info from the devices if it was formatted and rebuilt? We have a bios password but they may know it so we think it was rebuilt. It&#x27;s a Dell if that helps.

                              <span>We like having the option to working from home and incase another pandemic happens. 
 Hard decision has to be made -
 Should we buy $1,000 desktops + $1,000 laptops? or forget the desktops and spend the full $2,000 on laptops with docking stations and use it like a desktop with employees taking it home when needed.
 The desktop+laptop option seems enticing but having twice the equipment to keep track of, maintain, keeping track of files on two devices... could get messy, at least compared to just having the simplicity of one laptop for everyone.
 We&#x27;re looking to get 5 years out of the equipment. What would your preferred set up be for work if you had the option? what makes the most sense? Are surface pros with docks worth considering?

                              <span>I work in construction, was the sole IT department for a smaller firm for 2ish years. The whole time they were trying to fire a guy who was just to doing anything. Finally built their case and I got the email to term him. 
 Fast forward to last year and I see that the new company I had switched to hired this same person. I even said to my boss that he was fired from the last place for not performing. 
 Last night I was working late and a ticket comes through, Term Immediately. I&#x27;m the only person in the office so I take a look and can&#x27;t help but to actually LOL. Same guy I&#x27;d termed almost 2 years ago at a completely different company. 
 I have to say that might be one of the most coincidentally odd things I&#x27;ve done in my IT career.

                              <span>Had a user with an issue with his vpn. Error message said something about a delay with the vpn adapter. A quick search showed this was a WMI corruption issue. I tried turning off the wmi service then renaming the repository folder. No dice. I wasn’t surprised. That almost never works. I ended up having to reregister the DLLs and MOFs and a few more obscure tasks before it fixed the issue. I both love and hate WMI. Here is the list of commands:
 Sc config winmgmt start&#x3D; disabled net stop winmgmt cd %windir%\system32\wbem winmgmt /resetrepository winmgmt /resyncperf if exist Repos_bakup rd Repos_bakup /s /q rename Repository Repos_bakup regsvr32 /s %systemroot%\system32\scecli.dll regsvr32 /s %systemroot%. \system32\userenv.dll for /f %s in (&#x27;dir /b *.dll&#x27;) do regsvr32 /s %s for /f %s in (&#x27;dir /b *.mof&#x27;) do mofcomp %s for /f %s in (&#x27;dir /b *.mfl&#x27;) do mofcomp %s sc config winmgmt start&#x3D; auto net start winmgmt wmiprvse /regserver

                              <span>I am banging my head, trying to figure out what license I should use where we want to have a bunch of different users log in as a specific domain account. If we license said domain account, once it&#x27;s synchronized to M365 we try to open office as of today it will ask for MFA token. Sharing the QR code for the authenticator on employee&#x27;s phones is a no go and likely breaks EULA. 
 has anyone else had this issue? If so, how did you work around it? thanks in advance!

                              <span>Been upgrading batches of 5 people at a time to windows 11 after testing for the last year. Here’s some feedback I got:
  
looks more Mac like and that is a positive thing 
 snap layouts are super useful
 people are actually using virtual desktops (I did bill virtual desktops as a “new feature” even though it was in windows 10) 
 the simplified interface on the surface seems more intuitive 
 the learning curve is very shallow since most conventions from 10 carried over
 new context menu missing buttons is a sticking point 
  
For the most part feedback has been positive. I haven’t received any hate for bringing things from 10 &gt; 11, when I did receive some hatemail last time upgrading people from 7 &gt; 10. Totally anecdotal, but thought the upgrade being relatively easy on end users was notable.

                              <span>Our director of 15 years is retiring soon. This person hired me years ago. She has been a great director - doesn&#x27;t micromanage, tons of flexibility, plays the politics well, and buffers us from users / admin if necessary. We are a small dept. and everyone gets along. Sure there are things I would change but overall no major complaints.
 Everyone&#x27;s a little spooked that we will get someone with a bunch of accolades in here that don&#x27;t know what they are doing, or starts micromanaging way more than they need to. Truth be told we do need a little more accountability and more focused job descriptions - but just a little...
 In the end its probably out of our hands and we just continue to do what we do, but who has been through this and are there any ways to prepare? Obviously we all want to &quot;appear&quot; to have our shit together for a new boss. Some of us don&#x27;t really care we been doing it long enough though.

                              <span>Hello everyone. I’m looking for some suggestions on companies, (CT/East Coast if it matters), that will do monthly or quarterly vulnerability scans, and/or Annual Penetration Tests. I work for a car dealer with multiple sites and these new FTC laws are something else. I’m pretty new to this “IT Manager” gig so any recommendations would be greatly helpful. We have firewalls, Nable, and some other basic stuff that should suffice but part of the guideline is to provide that. If I posted in the wrong place, I apologize. Thanks in advance

                              <span>anyone else hate when people ask this after telling that you do IT. Like I get it if i know you and you were in the field, in that case it’ll benefit you knowing how much someone in a similar field is making/what you can expect to negotiate salaries.
 But If you’re in a completely unrelated field and don’t plan on making the switch into IT, i find it silly to ask…. i mean my own mom doesn’t even know how much i make lol

                              <span>Upon attempting to buy four M.2 cards on NewEgg.com, I was presented with a message saying that I had exceeded the &quot;limit&quot; and had to have a &quot;Business&quot; account...ignoring the fact that it say&#x27;s &quot;Business&quot; right by my account name in the header of the Newegg site&#x27;s page...
 So, I chat with NewEgg to try and resolve the issue...I&#x27;m quickly told the message refers to NewEgg&#x27;s website neweggbusiness.com and that I would have to place the order there, and they supplied a link to the account application page. 
 I asked our accounting person to complete the application to establish the account. Next day, I have my new login to neweggbusiness.com.
 Off I go to shop for my needed M.2 cards...huh, uh, but wait...now the pricing is different, the vendors are different, delivery is a 30 day window? WTF????
 After explaining this to my supervisor, who reports to the owner of the company who despises Amazon, I et permission to use Amazon. I head off to Amazon, where there is no limit, $50 each cheaper, and they will be here Monday...

I look at the cert and it says something legit like my VPN provider, verified by Globalsign.
 My question is: Why do they use these random-looking filenames vs. a standard updater that I could allow once? Is this kind of like password rotation but with executable rotation, to prevent people from being too trusting of any one updater? Might it not backfire in a similar fashion, with people getting used to allowing things to dial out from the temp directory?

                              <span>Fred worked as a support technician for a mid-sized company. One of his responsibilities was updating every employee’s computer to the latest operating system, which he did one by one. He was working late one cold night in October, and the building was silent and still. The motion sensor lights kept turning off around Fred, so he had to keep waving to turn them on. Eventually he gave up and let all of the lights go dark, illuminated only by the blue computer screen as it was making its final updates.
 A light turned on down the hallway, and Fred looked out to see who triggered it. But nothing was there. He turned back to the computer, and then another light flickered on, closer to where Fred was sitting. Again he looked out but didn’t see anyone there. Rubbing his eyes and shaking his head…</span>

                              <span>Hello All - Just looking for some advice.
 I recently jumped from a &#x27;generalist&#x27; sysadmin position to a more specified role within the same organization.
 The generalist position was within a niche part of the org with a small team/little documentation/complex environment. 
 My old boss is requesting I perform both job duties. His words on my replacement &quot;we don&#x27;t have one we will just wing it.&quot; New boss is aware of the requests. He&#x27;s already looking out for me, wants to make sure old boss does not take advantage of me. These requests were NOT on the offer letter I signed regarding the promotion.
 I respect my old boss, I respect my old small team, I don&#x27;t want to leave them high and dry... but I&#x27;m also excited to move into this specialized role, and I need to spend some time getting up to speed to perform... and honestly, I&#x27;m just done with the generalist life, I want to move on, close that chapter.
 Any advice on how I go about this?

 Sometimes because they don&#x27;t want to tell me salary, ok whatever. But sometimes I just reply &quot;I&#x27;m interested, what&#x27;s the next step?&quot; and they don&#x27;t respond. 
 This must happen 90% of the time, and knowing these guys are pulling in 15-20% of our salary and can&#x27;t even keep on top of replies is infuriating

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I have a topic to get my head around. We´re a small company - not going into details here - going heavy on SQL servers. By now, we have a small on premise infrastructure (4 Hyper-V hosts) which I wanna bring towards Azure in the future. While I plan the migration, I also want to enhance our daylie routines, workflows and such. The network is/was a mess when I took over.
 Back to the topic:
 Our users require access to MSSQL, create/restore backups and make changes to different databases (I want them to be able to spin up their own databases according to their needs). For now, they install MSSQL Server XXXX locally and use a per-core license, which is working completely fine. My problem: I´m sure the licensing is not correct, so I see urgent need to change this.
 My assumtions there is no difference between licensing SQL Server (Per-Core) on a server system or a client system. 
 So my idea was to spin up SQL servers (Dev, Test, Pdroc) with 100% correct licensing, give users access to it with permissions as needed and ban the locally installed SQL servers completely. Any thoughts on this? How are you guys handleing it if the Express edition is not an option due to the restrictions? 
 Thanks for your ideas, have a great weekend!

 Password Managers provide convenience to the end user and enhanced security for the IT departments responsible for that security. Many also allow you to store 2FA tokens in the same place you&#x27;re storing credentials for that account, thus removing the &#x27;two device&#x27; rule 2FA is built on. So the questions every IT department will eventually run into during implementation will be &#x27;Do I provide my end users the convenience of managing their 2FA tokens in a Password Manager?&#x27; or &#x27;Do I disable this functionality as a best practice to managing the security aspect of the 2FA rule and keep it segregated to a separate physical …</span>

                              <span>Dear all,
 In Azure Active Directory, I would like to change the state of my computers from Azure Registered to Hybrid AD Join.
 As mentioned by Microsoft, we have to use ADConnect to apply this task.
 (In my case, i am using an ADFS server to authenticate our users in different apps and my target (in the future) is to avoid ADFS server to authenticate...)
 ADConnect give us the choice between Federated or Managed domain.
 Even I am using ADFS, can I choose Managed Domain to &quot;Hybrid AD JOIN&quot; my computers???
 ​
 Thanks for your advices.

                              <span>Hi,
 I don&#x27;t know why on my wsus kb5015684 (W10 22H2 insider pre release) had been approved instead of &quot;insider&quot; not checked on the Products.
 Now my problem is my computers are on W10 22H2 and can&#x27;t get the kb5018410 who patch 0-day vulerabilities. Because no kb5018410 for Windows 10 22H2
 Have you an idea to solve this or when Microsoft plan to release officially 22H2 ?

                              <span>I am working on my budget for 2023 and looking for project ideas. I&#x27;m in a good place, mostly...I have new firewalls, new switches (assuming they ever show up), we do yearly pen tests, utilize SpecOps, are working on rolling out SSO, have an Exchange Online migration in place, ect.
 ​
 I was thinking about things like ZScaler (I still need to look into it) and looking for a DNS service, but beyond that, I&#x27;m having trouble coming up with things, so I though I&#x27;d see what others are planning on doing.
 ​
 EDIT: We have an MDM, ticketing is outside my sphere of influence, but yeah, we do need to improve that too.

                              <span>Hi everyone! I am currently doing an internship with a big Telco company. I joined about a month ago and I have been mostly learning about the infrastructure system here. I am part of a Security Services Department, which mean we provide Cyber Security solution to other enterprise and my team deals with all the infrastructure devices to ensure the connection works. Our department used many different types of hardwares and softwares. My supervisor is quite busy and doesnt have much time for me.Over my time here so far, my team has been mainly dealing with patch update and migration. Since I think I have gotten the hang on the things here, I want to try and initate areas of improvement and make an impact here. 
 I can share some of the hardware and software we used. VPN: Pulse Secure Firewall: SRX345 Backup:Datadomain AAA: Cisco ACS(Upgrading to ISE soon) Management: Servicenow, BigFix
 Other than those I mentioned above, we have also others like palo alto, fortinet , solarwinds , Vmware and I can share more info if you need more with confidentialty of course. 
 Looking for suggestions on areas I can focus on where I can you know help save time/save costs/save manpower. Thanks you so much!

 ​
 I have an AD domain that is called domain and I want it to become domain.com the domain is 2012R2
 ​
 The domain currently have PC in it, AD, and a fileserver mostly with shares GPO and etc

 Would it be better to 
 ​
 1) Rename the domain
 2) Make a New first/domain from scratch
 3) Make a new domain called domain.com in the domain forest

                              <span>I was recently offered a job to work with a major ISP (not in the US), mainly with their hosting platform, and having never worked at an ISP, is there anything I should keep in mind/know about that is severely dofferent from non-ISPs?
 I think it would be an amazing oppurtunity, but I’m also scared that it’s a lot of responsibility and I’m not really sure how people at non-ISPs react to people working ”at the root of it all” as it were. 
 So in short, do you consider it just another IT vendor, or is there anything in particular I should know about the ISP industry?

 ​
 However I&#x27;ve also tested and it all seems to work with no issues at all so I&#x27;m confused. Is it a case that it used to require full desktop client licences and no longer does?

                              <span>today will end my 11 years of MSP for a multitude of customers. from the single handyman up to the multi location education provider, dentist, lawyer, manufacturing, you-name-it-company out there.
 monday will be my first day of actual fixing stuff, instead of only adding bandaids - or at least that is what i am hoping right now.
 old guy is 2 weeks out, will be interesting what i inherit there. &quot;all is documented&quot; he said, oh how often i heared that the last years..^^
 ​
 may the it-gods have mercy with my free-time, that is nonexisting right now.

                              <span>Hi all.
 I originally had 2 domain controllers in my environment, DC and DC2. DC is currently not functioning, the desktop environment doesn&#x27;t load and a bunch of services are crapping out.
 I moved all FSMO roles successfully from DC to DC2 so now DC2 is the master. I spun up a new DC3, and want to remove DC from the environment by demotion.
 This is the error I am receiving when trying to demote via Server Manager on either DC2/DC3: https://imgur.com/a/Kwoswwv
 Because I cannot log into DC and demote from itself, I&#x27;m doing it from the other domain controller&#x27;s Server Manager by adding the server and removing the AD role / DNS role that way.
 Any idea what this error means and why it is showing up? If there is no way of cleanly removing from the environment, does anyone have a document on how to manually remove and clean up from the domain?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>So earlier in the week a user came in when I was doing something, never asked if I was busy (I was... Very). And proceeded to go into detail about a small issue he was having (which wasn&#x27;t affecting his ability to work and showed how much free time they have) after a couple of more interruptions from another 1-2 users he came back in again. That time i probably overreacted and used some choice language, explained that I was very busy and the proper channels he should be using (which he knows but chose to ignore). Anyway, just wondering if it happened to anyone else. Felling a bit bad as I overreacted a bit but was very busy on 3-4 other things at the time

After a planned grateful shutdown of our infrastructure, DC02 comes online with warnings saying it cant understand if it&#x27;s still a domain controller or not. &quot;Error determining if the targeted server is already a Donain Controller. The WS- management service cannot process the request...&quot; when i select the prompt to continue and complete AD promotion it errors out with the above once again. Dcdiag fails with DFSREvent for replication at sysvol (though sysvol is fine). Seems it&#x27;s giving me authentication errors (probably since it can&#x27;t reach directory to authenticate logged on user).
 Any ideas here?

                              <span>Hello
 I have a very strange &quot;issue&quot; on new machines after they have been imaged using our SCCM task sequence build. So I do apologize if this doesn&#x27;t make much sense... it isn&#x27;t very clear for me either.
 When you reboot or turn on these new built machines the device tries to automatically log in to an account and says password incorrect. I can&#x27;t see this account referenced anywhere in the sccm task sequence and i have no idea why its trying to log into this account when the device turns on...
 Is there any way to control this via a task sequence? When a user turns on the machine, I want the log in screen showing only options for the previous logged in user and &quot;Other User&quot;.
 Any advice its really stumping me...
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi y&#x27;all, got a question.
 Recently we started building up our secondary domain here at this school for just our department. Background is that we wanna use VMware Horizon and everyone else doesn&#x27;t. And with &quot;we&quot; I mean &quot;my boss&quot;. 
 Anyhow, we set up a new domain (first time for me going away from open source/linux), got a trust with the main domain. unidirective, transitive. Beacuse of privacy laws and whatnot the users will reside on the remote AD, but they are supposed to log in in our domain.
 This is all fine and dandy, everything works alright, except one thing that I have no idea how to replicate:
 The main domain is called something like domain1.school.int but they log in with [user@school.int](mailto:user@school.int)
 now our domain is also underneath school.int like this: domain2.it.school.int 
 I want to be able to login with the same [user@school.int](mailto:user@school.int) that they can in their domain, all that works now is domain1\Username or [user@domain1.school.int](mailto:user@domain1.school.int) 
 what exactly am i looking for to do that?

                              <span>Hello,
 We require a CAA record. We use Sectigo, so I assume our records will look something like this (as per the Sectigo FAQ):
 0 issue &quot;sectigo.com&quot;
 0 issuewild &quot;sectigo.com&quot;
 I&#x27;m not entirely sure if Sectigo wants these 2 records or just one of them; their FAQ is a bit vague? Input much appreciated.
 Is there anything else I should keep in mind adding these records?
  
I understand this record only affects the renewal or newly issued certificates, so no matter how much we&#x27;d fuck this record up right now, our sites won&#x27;t be affected as of today, have I correctly understood this? This is crucial - Our certificates are present in a lot of places, so it&#x27;d, frankly, be an absolute disaster if these records could negatively impact the sites today.
 Are there any other advice or tips you could give me that I should keep in mind?
 Thank you so very much!

 Let&#x27;s say we have not been in contact with John Doe for a year, and now we don&#x27;t know if he still works there, or if he retired, changed company, died or whatever. The same is true for most of our other contacts.
 What is an efficient way of checking if all these contacts are up to date (considering the contacts are in a .CSV), or if they are no longer related to this business?

                              <span>Hi all. So as the title says I recently got a job as a linux and Openshift admin at a major bank. I have never dealt with Openshift but luckily the bank says they will train me. My questions is what tech and certs can make my life easier in this role? and do any Openshift admins have any advice for me. Currently I have rhcsa, RHCE and LFCS.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know if this is the best place to ask, but I think you guys can help me. My workplace is building a new office and there will be a space for my team to work on computers, for configuring new machines, to do maintenance and to store consumables, parts and new computers. It will be a small place with about a 5mx2m dimension, I would like your opinion on what would be the best layout to work . I was thinking about getting a work table with 2 or 3 screens and a KVM switch on one of the walls and everything else would be shelf&#x27;s.

 Some say that the change will not be noticable, but other do. We have a couple of system that are not on OAuth yet.
 All the system require the same inputs. Example:
 Host name or IP address: smtp.office365.com
 Port: 587
 Username: [noreply@contoso.com](mailto:noreply@contoso.com)
 Password:
 Use SSL: Yes
 Will our few systems that use the SMTP settings above still work after Basic Authentication is turned off in our tenant?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I&#x27;m pretty new in the sysadmin world, currently undergoing my training. My first year or something is in the endpoint management/helpdesk team.
 Atm I&#x27;m taking care of setting up new notebooks for users. Here&#x27;s a short description of the workflow:
 Supervisor sends hardware request - &gt; I send out a premade mail requesting info about software the user needs - &gt; I install the software and set up their HCL Notes - &gt; hand out to user
 Now the issue is that the mail that I send out also asks for the user&#x27;s Windows and Notes passwords. Every cybersecurity workshop will tell users that their sysadmin will NEVER ask for their password (which is totally correct, right?)
 Obviously we&#x27;d somehow get into their accounts anyway so handing out the passwords doesn&#x27;t really change anything, it just feels wrong I guess? And it probably actually is. 
 We need the passwords for a few minor settings in Notes and that&#x27;s it. I asked my colleagues about it and they answered it with concerns that if users did these settings by themselves they&#x27;d scew it up and we&#x27;d get more tickets.
 My point of view is that I think that this could be done by the users with a well made tutorial.
 I&#x27;ve been getting more and more confused/negative answers towards the password mails that I sent out so it&#x27;s also a personal issue because I don&#x27;t want to answer a mail like &quot;Yes you are totally right, however...&quot;. 
 How do handle this at work and how could I change this situation for the better? Thank you for your answers in advance :).

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I would like to hear what your recommendations and experience of syslog servers are?
 I’m currently running Kiwi Syslog Server but I’m not very found of it so I’m considering changing it for something better. I feel like I’m missing some nice report features.
 Cloud or on prem, free or paid does not matter much. (As long as it is not too expensive)
 I would like to be able to do the basic things like setting up e-mail alerts, analyze logs, etc. I should also be able to set up alerts based on priority, keywords and more.
 I’m currently picking up logs from firewalls, switches, network thermometers, UPSes and more. Less than 100 devices I think.
 So, what are you using and are you pleased with it?

                              <span>I don&#x27;t really not what my Job title would fall into on paper, I have quite a generalized role and cover what I would say - is mostly a Sysadmin role.
 I guess you could say like a lot of people I have experience in O365, your general Azure resources with very small VM hosted xp, SharePoint, Cloud backups, Physical Networking/Firewalls/Switches, Desktop and Server support.
 What concerns me is on paper it can look like I have a lot of experience, Networking is definitely not my strongest point, but I know all the fundamentals to manage an enterprise network and in general what best practices are. Can I troubleshoot a moderate Networking issue? probably not if it&#x27;s outside general vlan/firewall traffic rules. If you were to put a Cisco switch Infront of me, can I configure it via CLI? Absolutely not without spending a few good hours googling. I&#x27;ve been spoilt by the luxury of using Meraki and how easy everything is to configure and manage on the GUI that I&#x27;m afraid my next gig will be expecting way too highly.

                              <span>The goal of this process is to give the CPU something to execute in case there is nothing else to do (thus it is called idle ;-). Let’s think about the next situation, we have a process using 30% of CPU, in that case PID 0 (System Idle) will consume the remaining 70%. Also, Idle is the first process that the kernel starts. Moreover, there is a kernel thread of System Idle for each vCPU the OS has identified .
 The reason for having an “Idle Process” is to avoid an edge case in which the scheduler (Windows schedule based on threads) does not have any thread in a “Ready” state to execute next. By the way, there are also other schedulers IO and Memory, which we will talk about in one of the next posts/writeups.
 When the kernel threads are executed they can also perform different power saving tricks regarding the CPU. One of them could be halting different components which are not in use until the next interrupt arrives. The kernel threads can also call functions in the HAL (hardware abstraction layer, more on that in the future) in order to perform tasks such as reducing the CPU clock speed. Which optimization is performed is based on the version of Windows, hardware and the firmware installed.

 I feel like idk wth I&#x27;m doing and may have bit off far more than I can hope to accomplish.
 Rant over good luck everyone!

                              <span>We have this setup: 
  
AD domain company.local
 Azure AD hybrid sync (one way only AD -&gt; Azure AD) for Office365 SSO
  
A new domain company.public has been created for training purposes. This AD is completely separated, lives in the DMZ and this is how it should be. 
 We now would like the company.local admins to have access to the company.public AD, just to avoid having multiple credentials as admins. 
 As AD Federation, as I see it, only needs port 80/443 this seems to me the safest way to implement this without &quot;really&quot; connecting the two AD domains (as we really don&#x27;t want to have them seeing each other).

                              <span>Hi all. I have been trying so hard but not seeming to manage to set up a GPO to automatically sync Documents | Desktop | Photos to OneDrive. 
 The GPO does get applied to the PC as I run an rsop and I see the policy, however the path remains a local one when I go to the properties of the documents. 
 Anyone can shed some light and help here?

                              <span>My company is in the process of switching to a Yubikey based authentication system. Ultimately we want to make it so that users can only login with a Yubikey and they won’t have a password at all. In Windows there is no way to disable the username/password login. So I figured we could just change everyone’s password and then just not give the password to them unless they need it for RDP or to setup their Microsoft 365 account on their work phone.
 So my question is, is their a tool that can do this, or can we change every password using PowerShell?

 Turning the TV on when people have meetings. Like it&#x27;s my responsibility to lift a remote for them and click a button...
 I was told that since televisions are part of IT, I was responsible to run cables through a concrete floor and water seal it by myself without the use of a contractor. Then re installing the floor mats with construction adhesive.... like.... what? 
  
Anyways let me know the dumbest thing management has ever told you that IT was responsible for

                              <span>The building I am in has 3 fiber pairs running from the back to the front. I believe it’s single mode. (Yellow jacket that says Corning Fibre Optics 6 SME)
 There are two sets of switches. 
 One set of switches has multimode transceivers with duplex multimode patch cables plugging into the fiber patch panel at each end on pair 1. 
 The other set of switches are using single mode transceivers with duplex single mode patch cables and plugged into the same patch panel using pair 2. 
 I can confirm that they are from the same cable. (6 wires that make 3 pairs). 
 Both setups work. How is that possible running over the same type of fibre? Assuming the fibre in between the patch panels is single mode, then multimode should not work or vice versa correct?
 Thanks.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve had a couple customers wanting to have us check firewall configuration with active checks and alerting them if there is any problems found. Like &quot;check if AV is working by trying to download EICAR test file&quot; or &quot;check if Port X,Y,Z are generally closed towards internet by trying to connect to destinations that would generally allow those ports&quot; etc.
 I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m googling the correct terms, as I couldn&#x27;t find any good resources on this topic.
 My first idea was setting up nagios or librenms or something and just use active checks for this. Curling EICAR test file or setting up tcp checks for certain ports / destinations and stuff.
 Am I on the right track for this? Is there dedicated software for this purpose?

                              <span>I currently have two routers running in my small business network setup. One is setup for the main network and is my Fortinet 80f. It currently has a 1gb circuit from ISP 1. The other is a Pfsense sg-3100 which is set up for our Kraft&#x27;s team only and it has its own 1gb circuit from a different ISP. My problem is the ISP on my main router is pretty crappy and has outages all the time. I would like to utilize the 1GB on my 2nd router for failover. I figured there must be a way to configure the lan port on the pfsense router to be able to utilize the circuit on the main router. Any ideas on how i should proceed with this configuration? vlans, bridge mode,??? help please!

                              <span>Is there a way to perform scheduled backups of my Firewalls to Panorama? I have been looking around to see if this is possible but thus far I have not found anything that confirms this to be possible.

                              <span>We have Cisco WLCs and are looking at Clearpass in our Higher Ed environment. I&#x27;m curious if anyone has these two features working with both vendors? 
  
Client network isolation based on student account for IOT devices (Clearpass AirGroups)
 Multi pre-shared key (Aruba term) or Identity pre-shared key (Cisco term)
  
It looks like Aruba can do both, if you have both Clearpass and Aruba APs. Cisco can do both with ISE and Cisco APs, but I&#x27;m having a hard time finding a documented solution with both vendors. 
 I did find this Aruba doc showing iPSK setup in Clearpass, but I&#x27;m not sure how the policy is enforced on the WLC side or if you can dynamically setup PSK&#x27;s on a per account basis. 
 Thanks for the help!

                              <span>I have a number of sites within a 3 mile radius in a UK city, currently just have ISP connection and sdwan with fortigate endpoints.
 After a brief chat to a contact at a local uni in the same city, who was setting up a 10gb link between buildings with dark fibre, it got me wondering if I am doing it all wrong!! :)
 So it&#x27;s just a general question to you my peers, what would you expect to pay to connect 2 buildings a couple of miles apart?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m helping setup a new network at a local church. They are using all Ubiquiti/Unifi equipment for firewall, switch, Wifi, etc. I&#x27;m wondering what others recommend for how to handle a Guest network.
 People will come in every weekend for a service and we want to have wifi available. Device Isolation and bandwidth throttling will definitely be enabled regardless of the options below. I&#x27;ve come up with 3 options for handling the Guest access:
  
Portal - Unifi has a portal available where you have to tap &quot;I Agree&quot; in order to use wifi. This does not require a password of any kind, which is nice, but some devices don&#x27;t play well with those type of portals
 WPA Key - We could print a passcode on a sign and post them around the building (it&#x27;s a small building). People enter that and get on the wifi. Pretty straight forward. Could change the password every once in a while if needed.
 Open - No password, no portal, just join and away you go. Most user friendly but least secure.
  
Just curious what others do, or would do, in a situation like this.
 Thank!

                              <span>I have two issues that I can&#x27;t find the answer for online. I had to swap out two line cards (a 10/40 gbps ethernet module and a 1/10 gbps module.)
 Both modules are green and have a status of &quot;ok.&quot; The 10/40 gbps module&#x27;s interfaces came up and I allocated all except one to the proper VDCs; however, the 1/10 module&#x27;s interfaces do not show in the management VDC or the production VDCs that they were originally assigned to.
 The second issue is that on the 10/40 card, interface 7 unlike the other interfaces on the card, is broken down into subinterfaces eth1/7/1 - eth1/7/4. Eth1/7/1 does not appear when I do a &quot;show interface status&quot; and when I try to allocate the other three subinterfaces to a VDC I get this error &quot;Port allocate not supported on this interface!&quot;
 Does anybody have an idea of what the cause of these issues are?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had a long-holding aspiration to become a senior network engineer. I&#x27;m making active progress towards that goal but know I have a long way to go. 
 My question is this, though. What qualifies someone as a Senior Network Engineer? Is it just a title? Is it professional level certifications? Is it years of experience?
 ​
 I know this is a very weighted question and will vary based on opinion, but I&#x27;m interested in everyone&#x27;s opinions. At what point do I know that I&#x27;ve achieved my goal? I&#x27;m a life-long learner and will continue to grow, but I have to have reasonable, attainable goals (short-term, long-term, or otherwise). Without them being reasonable/attainable they will forever hang above me like a badge of dishonor and no one wants that.
 ​
 Thanks, guys. Appreciate your insight.

                              <span>On my internship the building has 3 routers.One on the top floor, and two on the bottom floor. I was wondering how this connection works. I checked what wifi us available around me and it appeared as one. The router on the top is connected to the ISP and the ones on the botton floor are connected to the main router with ethernet cable. Why isnt there 3 networks?

                              <span>Figured this should be relevant to this sub with how prevalent they are. Got an email from them saying after March 31 2024 all xconns will be SMF. No more copper or MMF. So its about a year and a half out, but still something to keep in mind. I wouldn’t be surprised if other DC providers followed suit.

                              <span>I have a 2.5gbit Switch and want to have 5gbit speed, so I connect two RJ-45 cables from each pc into the switch.
 I thought I can assign the same ip address to multiple nics, but I&#x27;ve read this isn&#x27;t possible.
 So what is the best strategy to get 5gbit speed in my case?
 Bridging?

                              <span>Hi all, I configured a router and a connected switch to it. I can ping the router IP from the switch and vice versa. Also, I can ping 1.1.1.1 from the router, but I can not ping 1.1.1.1 from the switch. Here is the routing table of the router:
 inet.0: 5 destinations, 5 routes (5 active, 0 holddown, 0 hidden) + &#x3D; Active Route, - &#x3D; Last Active, * &#x3D; Both 0.0.0.0/0 *[Static/5] 21:05:20 &gt; to 172.89.117.1 via xe-0/1/0.0 172.89.117.0/22 *[Direct/0] 21:08:05 &gt; via xe-0/1/0.0 172.89.117.2/32 *[Local/0] 21:08:05 Local via xe-0/1/0.0 192.168.50.0/24 *[Direct/0] 06:25:54 &gt; via xe-0/1/2.0 192.168.50.1/32 *[Local/0] 06:25:54 Local via xe-0/1/2.0 
 The router IP addresses are:
 172.89.117.2 
 and
 192.168.50.1 
 and the switch IP address is:
 192.168.50.2 
 I should note that I can ping router interface from switch.
 any body can help me in this problem?

                              <span>Hi guys, 
 First time here, newbie on networking problems.
 I&#x27;m having problems to make an ssh connection from my host machine (ubuntu 22.04) and my virtual machine in Gnome Boxes (Ubuntu server 20.04). After failing to succeed, I relied on the following guide: https://bytefreaks.net/gnulinux/an-easy-way-to-ssh-into-a-gnome-boxes-os, with which I was able to open the ssh tunnel.
 The problem is that currently, I don&#x27;t know for what reason, the method no longer works and fails me in a generic: &quot;Network unreachable&quot; error. Do you have any idea why? Also do you know if there is a better way to connect me from host to guest using gnome boxes.

 Is this traffic still using TCP Port 443 or not?
 Because our firewall is blocking this link since we only allow https 443.
 But how can a link be https and use port 4110

 How to find what host is connected to the switch port on HP and Aruba switches? For example show mac-address table on a specific port and lets say i got the mac address of the device some doeds not make sense if i look up find mac addresses websites. Please suggest if I can use Wireshark to make it easier or just just running commands on the switch. Thank you all for your suggestions.

 I have started to look for a new job, after 10 years within the same company, and are going on a few network engineer interviews in the upcoming week. I am struggling to prepare for the non-technical questions. Specifically &quot;what&#x27;s 3 of your strengths/weaknesses?&quot; What kind of answers should I give, that doesn&#x27;t sound like clichés? Like &quot;I am bad at saying no so I always end up with too much to do&quot; or &quot;I suck at BGP, but I am alway keen to learn new things&quot;.

                              <span>Hey Guys
 We have Always on VPN. Deployed as Per the Richard Hicks Book. Works Great. 
 I am deploying the User VPN and Device Tunnels using Intune
 99% of the time the User VPN works and connects Automatically but the Device Tunnel never connects before the login screen. 
 Was hoping to have the device tunnel connect before login incase the user on the computer changes (EG at a site with no DC connectivity)
 I have a Windows 10 Computer. Works fine. Windows 11 won&#x27;t connect unless I do it manually
 We also have the issue in Intune where it says it failed to deploy but I can see both tunnels on the machine.
 Sort of annoying as I like Direct Access and it was connected when the computer got internet.

 I can&#x27;t see the archive tab anymore in Microsoft Purview Compliance Portal \ Data Lifecycle Management view.
 If it has moved, I can&#x27;t find it.
 The help documentation looks like it was updated October 4, 2022 and still points to this location.

 Any idea where that view has been moved??

                              <span>So recently I was auditing our systems and found many... and I mean many security vulnerabilities in our network. I brought this up to the entire IT department and the executives and all I got was &quot;put it in an email&quot;. 
 I&#x27;m so distraught about this. We have domain controllers that are running 2012 r2 that have not been updated since 2017... we even have a backup server that also runs 2012 r2 and is in the same boat... we don&#x27;t have licensing for our firewalls which I confirmed with the vendor that we have no threat protection... we have a dfl on 2008 r2 and no security practices in place. Oh... and did I mention that all backups are local? They seem to think that if someone hacked the network that the threat actor won&#x27;t see the replication server of the backups through a site to site that…</span>

                              <span>Hello,
 Need a little help with a PowerEdge R710. I&#x27;m not the System Administrator here but he quit during Covid so now I&#x27;m it. 
 Our PowerEdge R710 has an amber warning light on a drive so I checked on the Dell Openmanage Server Administrator. It&#x27;s predicted to fail but the status is Non-Critical. I want to replace it but I&#x27;m not sure which one to get. The current one is a Seagate Barracuda 1TB 7200RPM SATA 3.0Gb/s 32MB Cache. Can I replace it with a drive with more memory and higher speed? 
 ​
 Thank you

                              <span>Actually feel like an imposter period.
 I have ~2 years of generic sysadmin experience. I got an engineer role centered around power platforms / teams / 365 / exchange (on prem and cloud) around two months ago. I was administering 365 previously and had exchange online experience but no real exchange experience (patching, migrating on prem to 365 and dealing with all that).
 ​
 I feel pretty lost every day, I feel underqualified for this position and am hoping I can fake it until I make it.
 Lately Ive been tasked with automating governance with our power apps platform (Making a CoE environment group that purges inactive groups, sends emails to groups that never had apps/flows made etc). I&#x27;ve zero experience in power apps in general and even after a couple days of learning etc I still feel utterly clueless. For instance, I cannot figure out how to see what the contents are of an orphaned flow, when I share I just get an error about sharing to myself to see what was in the solution flow (which apparently only exists with these).
 ​
 I suppose I&#x27;m just seeing if anyone was ever in my situation (went from generic admin to a specialized engineer role) and had success with it. I&#x27;ve feel I&#x27;m a pretty competent individual but my God, I have never had job this difficult before. Truly night and day from what I used to do.

 Yesterday using my iPhone running iOS I caught public transport, and opened Word for the first time in a long time and was prompted to login, from the app itself which brought up the standard MFA screen from Microsoft. I selected the SMS option (I know, I&#x27;ve already moved to the auth app) and received the standard &quot;We texted your phone +XX XXXXXXXX12&quot; screen.
 After waiting about 45 seconds (normally, I get them after 3-5 seconds) I received an SMS from: +61 480 458 495 with the body &quot;Hi Use XXXXXX&quot;. I immediately called an on-staff engineer, and had them disable and…</span>

                              <span>I have a user who just constantly enters tickets about &quot;My computer feels sluggish&quot;. His employer has him working on a 7 year old Macbook Pro i7 16GB of RAM machine. This user has multiple adobe creative suite programs open along with 10+ chrome tabs as well as Outlook and Excel docs. Any time I visit this company he stops me to see if &quot;there&#x27;s anything you can do to make it faster&quot;. At this point Im just at a loss. The computer isnt especially slow, but the user will not accept &#x27;Have less programs open at once&#x27; as a solution. I am not sure what he expects, I even told him there&#x27;s not secret potential on this laptop that I can unlock for you. The company does not want to buy him a new laptop as what he has is pretty nice and would work well for most users. Now I just go in, walk him through PRAM setup. 
 How do you all handle &quot;my computer slow&quot; tickets?

                              <span>We actually had an incident where a team manager got his account phished ~6 months ago. Which ultimately was good since it finally pushed leadership to enforce 2FA standards(and no damage was really done then anyway). 
 Problem is I get near DAILY phishing test e-mails from them. It is just fucking clutter at this point. Hell I got three such dumbass ones today alone. ALso I can&#x27;t just ignore them entirely because our infosec team has stated not reporting the e-mails using the tool can be treated the same as failing the test by clicking it(though AFAIK nobody has actually been hit by that).
 Is there a good way to tell them that I appreciate the seriousness in which they treat the subject but ultimately are just annoying everybody?

We have strong Microsoft 365 tech skills on-hand and have been really underwhelmed by our current CSP&#x27;s support (which we pay extra for, beyond the licensing cost).

 Anyone have a CSP / Microsoft 365 support partner they are happy with?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been tooling around in the MS Graph powershell module as of late because it&#x27;s the only way to retrieve certain bits of data from AAD. It is my finding that Graph (perhaps just the powershell module, I don&#x27;t know as I haven&#x27;t yet started to work directly with the API) is likely the most unreliable system I have ever had the pleasure of using.
 - Every single time I load the module it takes different amounts of time to just do that
 - Switching to the beta profile might take a second, a minute or multiple minutes
 - Running Get-MGUser on a larger dataset might finish, it might not, if it does it might take one minute or it might take twenty minutes. When it fails VSCode just reports the connection was aborted.
 Graph has been around since what, 2019? I haven&#x27;t talked to a single person that had positive things to say about it at this point. Is this the normal experience with graph? Or is it just the powershell module?

                              <span>I have a WS2019 storage server where the OS partition (C:) is corrupt and I am unable to repair it. All my Veeam backups are on a separate partition (D:). My plan is to just blow away the OS and install WS2022 on C: . 
 My concern is that the data on the D: is currently deduplicated. Will erasing the OS partition effect those files or is the deduplication totally contained on the storage partition? I wasn&#x27;t sure if I needed to deduplicate the data beforehand or not?

                              <span>We are having a strange issue with Meraki vpn connection on some PCs.
 When first setup they can connect and rdp fine after they disconnect though and reconnect rdp traffic doesn&#x27;t work unless we delete all the Wan Miniports.
 After we delete them everything works again. After they connect And disconnect the delete will need to be done again.
 Anybody had this issue?

I was wondering if I could install it on a VM that I can give them all access to that would be on the same network as the DC. 
 From what I&#x27;m reading off google it has to be implemented on the DC in order to work but just wanted to make sure. Anyone have thoughts?

                              <span>Background : we have some Excel files that are probably 15+years old that people just keep updating through different office iterations. Some are to the point where they throw tons of errors any time they open it. I know myself and others in IT have spent countless hours doing our best to assist. Microsoft has said that different Office versions can change formulas or other variables and that likely is where the errors come from. I’ve tried explaining this to the end users that they will need to address the files themselves (fix or recreate. But it seems like quarterly or annually when they need to access some of these problem files the end users keep coming to IT with the same issue that we don’t have the tools, or time to address for what is ultimately an end-user problem.
 So in a broader sense how do you politely tell end-users that the problem they’re having is one that is their responsibility to fix, not IT’s?

We had Spiceworks HDS but were already looking into moving to Zammad or UVdesk but both need IMAP/POP to receive emails and generate tickets.

 We have a azure only user that needs to get added to ad distro. Sigh

                              <span>Seriously wth has happened to HP? Their printers, especially the officejet line, is absolutely terrible! Most inkjects are garbage that&#x27;s to be expected, but I have never seen printers in my life with this level of disconnections, software/hardware bugs, privacy intrusion, etc. The worst is I cannot even TURN OFF WSD on these F&amp;$($ printers! 
 The nature of the business we have most employees working out of third party clinics or from home, so they usually purchase their own printers or the clinics will purchase these crappy things for the staff to use, and it has been an absolute nightmare.
 Don&#x27;t get me started with the printer models ending with the -e, where you can&#x27;t set up wifi or even print from the device until you create a stupid ass HP account. I don&#x27;t encounter even 1/4 of these type of issues with inkjects from manufacturers like Brother or Canon, it&#x27;s always the crappy HP printers.

                              <span>Anyone here using Network Solutions (NS from this point forward)? I logged into my account today and after receiving my 2fa from number 122395, I received another from 1-855-909-0331. Hmmmm. Now I am trying to figure out who is at fault here. How did a 3rd party know I just logged into NS in order to send me a fake auth code and how did they know my number? Does NS have a breach? Cant be my phone vendor, for I logged in from a laptop. If traffic was sniffed on my network or pc, there wouldnt be anyway to see the phone number. NS tier1 support didnt know what I was talking about and escalated the case. Hope to get an email from support soon. 
 If anyone reading this could log into their NS account to see if the same thing happens and share your feedback, it would be greatly appreciated.
 Side Thought: Why is NS still using SMS for authentication. They have been around a long time. Would be nice if I could use my Yubikey or even an Authentication App.

                              <span>Does anyone where to find any documentation of AWS VMs Backup strategies? I’m familiar with the “classic” on-premise backup strategies but I’m sure the way to implement a good cloud backup plan/strategy isn’t like the on-premise one. We use n2ws Backup &amp; Recovery, any advice welcome.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been asked to start taking on more IT responsibilities at work. I haven&#x27;t worked much with firewalls, and have been asked to switch my offices firewall over to a new internet circuit. 
 The ISP gave me the following IP information, and I feel like I&#x27;m missing something in understanding what to input for the IP, Subnet and Gateway addresses. 
 ISP Provided Info (I changed a few numbers around for privacy purposes):
 WAN IPv4: 3.15.202.216/29
 Peer IP (IPv4): 3.15.202.21
 Lumen Peer IP (IPv4): 3.15.202.217
 I&#x27;ve been testing different configurations against my laptop to try testing the internet circuit and nothings worked so far. What am I missing? 
 I&#x27;m probably going to call the ISP later. I just figured I&#x27;d jump on Reddit and start to network with more tech people while I&#x27;m on this new endeavor in life.

 📷
 About a year ago I created a pretty foolproof way to have a shared Service Account that would still require MFA in the cloud, using some Azure Automation and run as accounts. Not keeping up on upcoming changes I see Run As accounts are no longer an option and am trying to adjust my Script to use the managed Identity that is created with the Automation resource. The way it worked before was the Run as Account would get a few permissions once it was created the App Reg would get
  
Application Permissions
 Select User.ReadWrite. All
 GroupMember.ReadWrite. All
 Delegated Permissions
 User.ReadWrite
  
It would also get User Admin RBAC role. All of these permission were needed to change the password of a Synced up account and also was used to Read group membership of a security group that had all users with access in it so if one was disabled it would then force a password change Now with a managed Identity I understand it is suppose to be easier but am not able to get it to Write the changed password . I assume it will also have issues with the group membership changes script also.
 Here is the only snippet of the Script where the Run as account was called
 ## get automation account: $connection &#x3D; Get-AutomationConnection -Name AzureRunAsConnection $azconnection &#x3D; Get-AutomationConnection -Name AzureRunAsConnection Connect-AzureAD -Tenant $connection.TenantID -ApplicationId $connection.ApplicationID -CertificateThumbprint $connection.CertificateThumbprint write-output &quot;Connected Azure AD&quot; Connect-AzAccount -Tenant $connection.TenantID -ApplicationId $azconnection.ApplicationID -CertificateThumbprint $azconnection.CertificateThumbprint write-output &quot;Connected AZ Accounts&quot;

 A long time ago I remember setting the retention period for various admin logs so they were retained, I set them to a year from memory.
 Now I have to prove it for an audit, but it was so long ago I can&#x27;t remember where I set it up?
 Anyone give me a hint please?

There are 40 DID numbers under their SmartVoice PRI plan that I may to need to keep some and trim the rest. I&#x27;ve read up on the options but get back/forth advice likely because certain partners are trying to make a sale and other enthusiasts who love will love tinker too much. I&#x27;m hoping to get as close to set and forget as possible after initial config, but would like to see what you guys make of it all. My current interpretation is as follows, but would encourage any corre…</span>

                              <span>I asked literally yesterday about whether you could use Business Standard and Business Premium if you have hit the 300 limit. This seems to vary by region on a second look.
 UK ( https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/business/microsoft-365-frequently-asked-questions ):
  
Yes, you can mix and match Microsoft 365 plans. Please note that there are some license limitations at the plan level. The Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Apps for business, Business Standard, and Business Premium plans each have a limit of 300 users, while the Enterprise plans are for an unlimited number of users. For example, you can purchase 300 Business Premium seats, 300 Business Standard seats, and 500 Enterprise E3 seats on a single tenant.
  
US ( https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/business/microsoft-365-frequently-asked-questions ):
  
Yes, you can mix and match Microsoft 365 plans. Please note that there are some license limitations at the plan level. The Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Apps for business, Business Standard, and Business Premium plans have a collective limit of 300 users, while the Enterprise plans are for an unlimited number of users. For example, you can purchase 200 Business Premium seats, 100 Business Standard seats, and 500 Enterprise E3 seats on a single tenant.
  
There&#x27;s no mention of a collective limit on the UK page...is this accurate?

                              <span>Just spotted this section and tick box in &quot;Remote Desktop Connection&quot; on Windows 10 (maybe it&#x27;s always been there!) see https://imgur.com/a/XrvbGQc
 I&#x27;ve googled +&quot;Remote Desktop&quot; +&quot;Use a web account to sign in to the remote computer&quot; but nothing. Even a more vague search returns nothing.
 &quot;Help&quot; just takes me to a Bing search with no detail.
 r/RemoteDesktopServices has a very low usage/reply rate, so probably not much use.
 thanks in advance!

                              <span>We&#x27;ve just had a new dedicated 100Mb connection from Vodafone installed and we found we didn&#x27;t seem to have full speed when connected.
 I&#x27;m currently testing with a laptop into the connection so to bypass any possibility it&#x27;s something internal
 Ethernet shows connected at 100Mb Speed test results from https://www.speedtest.net/ show download speed in the 20-50Mb, upload looks better as we get 75-90 sometimes. A speed test via Google gets similar download speeds.
 Is there a better tool for checking speed? 
 I understand we won&#x27;t get 100Mb and that they only offer the speed within their own network but I&#x27;d hope to be getting faster speeds than what we have. We&#x27;ve not used Vodafone before and this is not a good experience so far, support has pretty much got me to run ping on the laptop for a few minutes - thankfully this is a backup connection.
 Thanks,

                              <span>Anyone have experience with AWS ECS with ec2 instances (not fargate)? In particular I need to pass in environment variables to containers where the value is evaluated command output? I.e, var TEST&#x3D;$(ifconfig | x | y |z) evaluates to TEST&#x3D;ipaddress
 Context is I need to set the ecs cluster instance IP as a var inside all containers for specific logging requirements. The instances rotate frequently for new upgrades etc so the ip changes hence this needs to be automated.
 I&#x27;ve tried a bunch of stuff, and aws even provide a Metadata file that&#x27;s accessible in all containers for this but I&#x27;m unable to retrieve this in a system wide environment variable and it looks like ECS doesn&#x27;t support this and just passes in the var as a literal string even though it&#x27;s using docker under the hood and it works in docker fine. 
 I&#x27;ve tried using entrypoint and command parameters and can export variables but this isn&#x27;t system wide in the containers and they need to be sourced from file or require an interactive shell login e.g /etc/environment or /etc/profile etc
 Any ideas would be appreciated!

                              <span>Hi All,
 Throwaway for reasons.
 Posting here as a fallback in case anyone else is seeing this.
 I work for a small-medium MSP and we have a data center where we host customer servers on a Windows Failover Cluster.
 In the last month or so we are seeing (seemingly randomly) RDS Session hosts reporting &quot;offline&quot; in our RMM.
 Notes / Symptoms
  
You can still ping the server (internally)
 You CANNOT browse to any UNC Share (C$, Admin$ etc)
 The FO Role is still &quot;Running&quot; you can open a console session however it will not authenticate to the DC (Domain not available)
 All current users are kicked from the session host
 It DOES NOT happen to all session hosts at once (ie in a farm of 5, 1 will go offline and the others remain online)
 We THINK it is related to Sophos, uninstalled and the issue does not occur (it occured once but we are taking that as a one off)
 Seemingly not related to a Windows Patch
  
Environment(s)
  
Server 2019
 FSLogix with dedicated profile server
 AV Sophos Intercept X Advanced
  
The only way to get it back is to hard power the role down in FO Cluster Manager and then back on, it comes back up fine as if nothing happened.
 Currently we are shifting problem customers/servers to our VMware farm which seems a lot more stable but this is not really something we can do quickly.
 Anyone else seeing this at all? MSFT and Sophos are being very little help indeed, but we are plugging away with them in any case.

 Is there any way to thoroughly check the cables - especially the installed ones in the wall? 
 All 8 strands are correctly connected in each case, I have already confirmed this with a tester.

                              <span>TLDR; manipulated the school system, got caught, then got the job as an admin a few years down the line. 
 When I was at secondary / high school, my ICT lessons were always the best. It was a time where I did 20% work, and 80% trying to exploit the system to gain some sort of advantage over the other standard student accounts. Now, I wasn’t doing this for any malicious intent, just for personal satisfaction. 
 Our school had everything very locked down as most did for a student. The limitations were as I would compare to an exam/ kiosk type account at the time. One IT lesson, I was looking at the pxe boot options and found they were using SCCM. I was hit with a login screen and almost admitted defeat. I thought, what the hell and tried my student details. They worked 
 Turns out the sysadmins had just added the \domainusers group to authenticate. Once launched, I was able to re deploy a Windows environment and more notably to me at the time, create a local admin account. Once I found this out, I was able to sit at my allocated computer and happily install all the programs I wanted and hide my tracks. ICT lessons then turned into 100% fun. 
 One day, I got caught out by a teacher remotely viewing my screen and got called to the IT office. Had to explain what I had done and instead of a slap on the wrist, I was praised for finding the exploit! 
 2 years after I left the school, I then got a job as a system admin at the same school and even used that scenario to my advantage during my interview. 
 And we all lived happily ever after!

                              <span>Hey,
 Lately at my company, we have a bunch of mails that are send from our own mail server to someone of us, where the mail is detected as spam by our antivirus software. Upon inspecting the source code of the mail itself, we found the following.
 [name@domain.co](mailto:name@domain.co)m
 Visually it will write [name@domain.com](mailto:name@domain.com) but behind the stage it&#x27;s writing [name@domain.co](mailto:name@domain.co) span span m which doesn&#x27;t make sense.
 In a normal case it should write this instead.
 [name@domain.com](mailto:name@domain.com)
 Does anyone have some ideas as to why this is happening?

                              <span>Hey All,
 I know it&#x27;s been asked a million times but wanted some fresh insight.
 We are a small business, 15TB of data on our server. After migrating servers I was made aware of crashplans terrible speeds...
 I searched other posts and a lot of people reccomend Backblaze.
 We only pay ~$18 a month for Crashplan, with Backblaze it would be about $75 a month for storage alone, with another $20 a month (I believe) for something like cloudberry to pair with Backblaze.
 It&#x27;s a pretty extreme price jump, and considering our office is in Australia (Blazeback is US based), would you guys have any suggestions?
 Server:
 Windows Server 2022 (VM)
 64GB of ram

                              <span>I work for a newer company that has grown rapidly over the past 10 years and has had a “whatever it takes” approach to things in the past, but is now pushing to mature by standardizing our tools, software and procedures. 
 This has ruffled feathers with some of the more seasoned end users, who get frustrated with us and sometimes even get snarky when they find out that a license has been deactivated and they’re now expected to change a workflow. 
 While I’m now in a senior position, I spent many previous years in pure HelpDesk getting here and I’ve come to realize that that I’ve got the hero, people pleaser DNA inside of me. I pride myself on exceeding expectations and giving end users the best service I possibly can. On the flip side, I struggle a lot with conflict or disappointing end users to the point that it gives me anxiety. 
 I’ve come to realize now that saying “No” is a critical skill I need to get better at if I want to grow further in my career. I know that you can’t please everyone, and often the company you work for is going to expect you to enforce policies whether you personally agree or not. 
 Does anyone have any insight, advice or strategies on how I could get better at this kind of thing? Thanks!

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I have been trying to do some research in regards to switch daisy chaining and unfortunately I have been getting a lot of conflicting answers and I am reaching out to see if anyone here as any experience in regards to this.
 I am working on a property that has appx 20 buildings and we have connected each building together via cat6 cable and network switches.
 However it seems like some devices, specifically the devices on the end of the chain not all but some are having connection issues. I did notice some high ms when i ping the devices around 300 - 800. I was told that every switch kind of relights the signal and that I shouldn&#x27;t be having any issues. It seems like when i try to access the devices web gui it can take several minutes to load. We have appx 30 switches on this chain.
 Any info would be appreciated it.
 ​
 Hope someone can help me out!
 ​
 Thanks
 ​
 Here is some more details.
 Switches are 5 Port or 8 Port Gigabit POE SwitchesDevices - Hikvision Cameras 10/100 POE
 The switches are daisy chained one to the next to the next etc
 CAT6 Cable between the longest switch is less than 100m.

 I just created a lab in GNS3 for MPLS L3 VPN to just learn the technology and practice.
 I just followed configuration steps from one of the videos in youtube but it&#x27;s not working as shown in the video.
 Issue: Customer Routes are present in VPNv4 BGP table in R1 (PE) but not in R8 (P RR). Can you guys please advise if i am missing something or a mistake.
 In google drive link, I have provided the Diagram, some snippets from the CLI of PE and RR along with Configuration files of PE (R1) and RR (R8).
 Also provided capture file in google drive link, captured on link between R1 and R8. Capture file shows update travelling from R1 to R8, but R8 BGP VPNv4 table doesn&#x27;t have the customer routes 4.4.4.4/32 and 5.5.5.5/32 prefixes.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m putting together a networking kit since work doesn&#x27;t seem to ever want to order one and it&#x27;ll be great to make my job easier when clients come saying their computer isn&#x27;t working. I also don&#x27;t want to drop a G for fluke products.
 I&#x27;m looking at Klein Tools Scout Pro 3 as it is compatible with their toner and they have a kit with the tester and &quot;test + map remotes&quot;. What are the use for these? I probably don&#x27;t need them but I would like to know what uses they have. Also, if anyone has used any of their cable testers and toner, how did they like them? 
 Here is the link for just the upgrade kit for these remotes: https://www.kleintools.com/catalog/cable-testers/test-map-remotes-2-6-upgrade-kit-scout-pro-3-tester
 Thanks ahead of time.

 the previous solution
 I am currently using an old Cisco Catalyst 3560cg switch for filtering IPv6 traffic using a Port ACL.
  switch# sh run | begin access-list ipv6 access-list block_IPv6 deny ipv6 any any 
 Config on port: &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; switch#sh run int gi 0/1 Building configuration...

 This works flawlessly without any issues.
 The issue:
 I have an Cisco ISR901 (A901-6CZ-F-A) lying around that I wanted to use to replace the old Cisco Catalyst.
 My problem is I can&#x27;t get the IPv6 ACL to work. I need two interfaces, one to connect my ISP-Router (where I want to filter IPv6-Traffic) and one Interface to my…</span>

 I am looking for a not-very-expensive switch with 2-4 10G SFP uplink ports and 48 1Gbase-T ports. I am shooting for under $1000.
 Dell N3200 switches start at $7700. What else is likely to work?

                              <span>I&#x27;m using a Windows machine with an onboard NIC and a USB adapter NIC. One connected to a static, public IP and the other to the private lan. Right now if i search what is my public IP it is giving me the public IP that belongs to the private lan, which by way of an ACL or something does not allow external incoming connections. This was something I was told by the managed networks services team. 
 I manually configured the interface metrics in each of the adapter&#x27;s properties to 10 and 20, with the lower one configured on the adapter I want the public IP to actually be. When I disable the private lan adapter the appropriate public ip is displayed but as soon as I enable, the wrong public IP is back.
 Any thoughts on what I am overlooking here? This used to work but we did some cable management and now it&#x27;s not working. All of the physical connections are the same as before.

 The issue is that I am doing a 48 port switch and I get 48 lines saying &quot;Compliant&quot;
 How can I change this so that if any one of the 48 ports are in vlan 1, I get one single &quot;not complaint&quot; print out. And if all 48 ports are out of vlan 1, I get just 1 statement saying &quot;compliant&quot;, instead of 48?

If that doesn&#x27;t make sense, another way for me to try and describe it is I would like some type of new segmentation on the client&#x27;s network, that will carry my trunk lines over their network. The reason is, there are no available free fibre patch panel ports and these are autonomous networks.

 Any ideas?

                              <span>Hey all, 
 I&#x27;m setting up a business 10GbE internal network using a Synology DS1821+ with (8) 16TB 7200 Seagate EXOS drives and two 10GbE RJ45 ports in the rear. This is for a video production company that wants the maximum data throughput to their devices since they frequently edit 4k 120fps uncompressed footage. My plan is to run both 10GbE ports from the Synology to a QNAP QSW M1208-8C through RJ45 to SFP+ adapters, then connect my 8 users to the switch through the remaining (8) RJ-45 ports with Cat6 Cable (all less than 75 foot runs). Additionally, I was planning to connect their modem to the switch using a 1GbE RJ45 to SFP adapter since their current internet speeds are 500/500. 
 My current issue is that I can&#x27;t find a compatible 10GbE or 1GbE adapter that QNAP lists as compatible with the network switch. Would a generic adapter from FS suffice? Is compatibility required?
 My second issue is future expandability. With the NAS and the internet modem taking up of the (3) SFP ports using adapters, the remaining (8) RJ45/SPF combo 10GbE ports are taken up by the (8) users with RJ45 CAT6 cables. Would the smartest move when it&#x27;s time to expand be to daisy-chain another switch in through the SFP port? Or purchase a new switch that has more ports?
 My third question is regarding bottlenecks. In each of the computers we have PCIE network cards that are rated for at least 5GbE, most 10GbE. Will our bottleneck be the computer connection or the speed of the Synology in RAID 6? Either way we should have plenty of bandwidth for editing 4k/120fps uncompressed, but I want to be getting the maximum throughput possible out of this system. 
 Thanks so much in advance.

                              <span>We have a customer that purchased a Layer 2 circuit to connect their remote branch with the main office. Currently, each office has a unique subnet, which is managed by a SonicWALL device at each location. The customer isn&#x27;t very tech/network savvy, but I&#x27;ve only really dealt with Layer 3 (networking support is more of a side-service our company provides), so I&#x27;ve not had experience trying to connect things over Layer 2. 
 My understanding (forgive me for my ignorance) is that Layer 2 only deals with MAC addresses, so it doesn&#x27;t know how to route anything to do with Layer 3 (e.g. IP addresses). 
 Per the Layer 2 vendor, we connected the SonicWALLs to the designated ports on the Layer 2 appliances they installed at each location, but I haven&#x27;t been able to figure out the appropriate configuration to get the two subnets to talk to each other, if that&#x27;s even possible.
 Here&#x27;s a rudimentary diagram of how things are currently connected; basically each SonicWALL is connected to the vendor-provided appliance
 Subnet 192.168.10.0/24 SonicWALL A (Port X2) | Frontier NID (Layer 2) | Frontier NID (Layer 2) | SonicWALL B (Port X3) Subnet 192.168.12.0/24 
 Since the subnets are separate, I tried setting up a static route on each SonicWALL so that traffic bound for the other office&#x27;s subnet use the interface that&#x27;s connected to the Layer 2 devices rather than the default gateway, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to get through.
 I can try to provide additional information if that would be helpful; I&#x27;m just uncertain of what would be relevant here.
 Many thanks for any insight and apologies for my unfamiliarity with this stuff.

                              <span>So essentially, I&#x27;m setting up a network for a client and my boss wants to see if there&#x27;s a way to setup a VPN before we install the network on site. We do support post-install so we just need a simple VPN to be able to access the network equipment if need be. The site is across the country, so we want to get as much done off-site to save money travelling, hence why we&#x27;d like the VPN setup before install. The issue being that we don&#x27;t know what the broadcast IP of the network will be until we actually go and install it. 
 Is there any way to setup this VPN to connect in a different method? Or does it need to know the target network&#x27;s broadcast IP to connect?
 VPN setup for remote access isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;m super familiar with so sorry if this is a dumb question/wrong place for it.

 Configuring RADIUS on a Dell S3048 is a complete nightmare in terms of roles and privilege levels. Maybe it&#x27;s not, maybe I&#x27;m just mad cause I don&#x27;t get it. I&#x27;m turning to you fellow networking redditors for assistance *kneels down like the peon that I am*

 Login with a service account for config retrieval in a secure manner (monitoring purposes), specifically running-configuration and startup-configuration. To be more specific, this is the totality of the information I want to retrieve with said service account:
 show running-configuration
 show startup-configuration
 show inventory
 show version

                              <span>Full disclosure, I am not a network administrator, I&#x27;m only the director so bear with me possible being an idiot..
 Here&#x27;s the situation..
 HP C7000 Blade chassis with dual Flex-10 modules. Each module has 2 connections coming out. One goes to one top of rack extreme switch and the other to a secondary extreme switch. The Flex-10 is configured to use both.
 One of the Extreme switches decided to malfunction but not go down hard. So, the Flex-10 still thinks it&#x27;s there and therefore continues to try and use it (and fails). My guys had to go into the Flex-10 and redirect it all to go to the secondary switch, restart the malfunctioning switch at a remote data center and then go back into the Flex-10 and put it all back. This takes a lot of time and does not help my SLA&#x27;s.
 I find it hard to get my head around that in 2022, we don&#x27;t have anything that can determine health of the network traffic beyond a heartbeat. Is there anything out there that you all know of that would work better? I have to have 99.99% uptime so whatever improvements I need to make, I need to do that.
 ​
 TIA!

                              <span>TLDR; Looking for project management software/ ability to track contacts, network information and any other IT related items.
 So by years end my job title and role in the company I work for will be changing. I am going from network support engineer to technology project lead. I work for a property management company so we have a lot of turn over as far as properties go. 
 I have been tasked with trying to find a tool or way to better organization the entire process from start to finish of taking on and transitioning away a property. My side of things is still heavy on the network and voip aspect of it all. It would be great if it had sharepoint integration but a big plus for me would be the ability for the rest of our small IT department to look through it when needed. Main focus would be tracking contacts and network information.

                              <span>Hey folks, 
 i am currently enrolled in learning programming and one of our recent topics is basic network/-ing.
 So our vm broke down and currently won&#x27;t be fixed until the end of this course and we&#x27;re all learning from home.
 I read that thread https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/2r5mgn/best_way_to_learn_networking/ but since it&#x27;s 8 years old, i want to make sure that maybe some newer stuff is available.
 Long story short, is there any way for me to virtualise or emulate a &quot;basic&quot; network and configure virtual router/switches/vlan and so on?
 Should i install linux on a 2nd pc or rather emulate on my 1st.
 I would be grateful for any guidance, tips, books, youtube whatever.
 ​
 Thanks and cheers!

 Running Windows Server 2019, no VLANs, no separate subnets, one home router as gateway and three unmanaged switches. Single server hosting all of the DNS, DHCP and WDS services.
 One day I can get PXE working fine, the very next I&#x27;m running into constant TFTP timeouts. As of yesterday I had a BIOS system consistently booting fine, and a UEFI system constantly failing. Today both fail. 
 Attempting to deploy a custom Windows 10 image, no drivers. I have both x86 and x64 boot images. Only DHCP option set is 60: PXEClient. WDS deployed as standalone server (No AD), unattended installs set for both the images as well as WDS. DHCP settings per WDS are default (do not listen on DHCP ports, configure DHCP…</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m relatively new to working with Layer 3 and am in the process of rolling out some new routers to some of our satellite sites using Aruba Layer 3 (2930f, 3810m) switches. In my head, I&#x27;d like each VLAN to have ip ospf x.x.x.x area backbone so that they show in routing tables as IntraArea (as I think that&#x27;s technically what they are). 
 However, it seems the 2930s can only support 8 OSPF interfaces? This means I&#x27;m forced to use redistribute connected on the OSPF router which makes routes show as External2 (doesn&#x27;t feel right to me).
 Is this the accepted correct way to configure this or am I missing something somewhere? Thanks!

                              <span>Hello!
 I am not sure if this is right community for my question but maybe someone will be able to comment.
 I am working with 5G enabled technology and I was wondering if there exists any networking device that is compatible with 3GPP release 16 5G network (similar to this https://mikrotik.com/product/chateau_5g_ax but would support rel.16 features). Since release 16 is probably not rolled out by mobile network operators I was wondering if it is even possible to buy rel.16 compatible device in advance. My concerns arise from specific features promised by 3GPP rel.16 for example Integrated Access and Backhaul, CV2X (Cellular-Vehicle-to-Everything) which doesnt sound like regular 5G features therefore would require specific modems, right? Another thing is that for example Mikrotik on its product page doesnt even specify specific 3GPP release, only available 5G bands which I think indicates that this release doesnt even matter and this model will be compatible with future versions of 5G. Is that correct?
 I guess my question boils down to - is there any public information from MNO vendors wheter these 3GPP features will even be enabled and if they will be - can I buy hardware for it in advance?

 We have a vxlan deployment and have leaf/spine setup. We have POD&#x27;s where 2 leafs is making up a pod. These 2 are vpc connected.
 Today we have some tracking that is not working at all.
 What i am asking is if i lose uplinks towards the spine, i am very likely to stop forwarding vxlan traffic on the leaf that lost uplinks.
 Cisco states you could have a l3 link between the leafs ( System nve infra-vlans )
 How have you guys done it?

The job had a lot of freedom to work on what ever projects I wanted, large budget, hands off manager, fun end users, able dictate when and how tasks get accomplished. 
 With that large amount of freedom there was nobody telling me what to do so I had to develop a workstyle that had a lot of self-initiative.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to enable smart card authentication to a workstation.
 When I launch my RDP session and click &quot;Connect&quot; it prompts me for my pin and after entering it, fully connects through the gateway. But once the connection hits my workstation, it prompts me for either smart card or username/password. I click smart card and it shows &quot;Insert a smart card&quot; but doesn&#x27;t seem to be reading it (no certificates pop up). 
 I believe I enabled the correct GPO settings, since I&#x27;m able to connect to the RD Gateway:
 -Force the reading of all certificates from the smart card
 -Turn on Smart Card Plug and Play Service 
 Is there something I&#x27;m missing? 
 RDP Settings: All settings checked under &quot;Local devices and resources-&gt;More...&quot; Advanced Tab-&gt;&quot;Settings...&quot; -Use these RD Gateway server settings: -Servername: *RD GATEWAY server name* -Logon Method: Smart Card or Windows Hello for Business -Logon Settings-&gt;Checked &quot;Use my RD Gateway credentials for the remote computer&quot;

                              <span>I&#x27;m sure we have all encountered typosquatting/&quot;similar domain hijacking&quot;, or in my case the registration of a domain with a typo for the purposes of email-only spear phishing wire fraud. Typically when I see that the email server is some random VPC or a compromised host, but today I encountered one involving a thirdparty_with_typo.com hosted on Exchange online, and targetcompany_with_typo.com hosted on G Suite. 
 I reported both to their registrars, and then went to look into reporting the G Suite and M365 tenants themselves and found that a bit more interesting.
 For G Suite I couldn&#x27;t even find where to do it (everything seemed to point towards individual gmail accounts, not G Suite), and for Microsoft I found https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/engage/cars - but they closed the case after a couple minutes stating:
  
The activity reported is associated with a customer account within the Microsoft Azure service. Microsoft Azure provides a cloud computing platform in which customers can deploy their own software applications. Customers, not Microsoft, control what applications are deployed on their account.
  
So, does Microsoft not actually care about crimes committed using their services, or did I just luck into the wrong support rep responding and closing without understanding.
 FWIW too, the one on Exchange online is spoofing a massive global company (250k+ employees) registered about a month prior to the target, so I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if my guys weren&#x27;t the only ones targeted.

                              <span>Just volunteering this info in case anyone else runs into it. I scoured Reddit and every other forum for far too long before I found the solution.
 I ran into 2 cases of the issue this week and tried every which way to fix --- my users&#x27; Win10 VDI terminals would auto-lock after 1 minute. However, if I rebooted them and logged in, the problem didn&#x27;t happen. Then, if I logged out and back in, the problem started up again. Very annoying and tricky to troubleshoot. To make it more annoying, the problem would eventually fix itself over night and the user could log in again and work normally. I&#x27;m relatively new here and my coworker said he&#x27;d never been able to fix it, confirming as well that it would eventually fix itself over-night.
 Repairing VMWare Tools didn&#x27;t help either. A complete, total uninstall of VMWare Tools and a reboot completely fixed the issue. What clued me in was reading in some forum about a person that updated their mouse driver and had that fix the problem. Sure enough, that was it.

                              <span>I&#x27;ll try to summarize this as briefly as possible. Recently, I&#x27;ve seen quite a number of posts asking for recommendations for IT asset management software. Not that people can&#x27;t ask, but I think this might be a bit of an overdrawn topic, and if possible, we can have a thread where we refer people whenever they ask.
 Now, there is no shortage of IT asset management software options available, but the difference between them, or any of them, is that they are either open-source or cloud-based. What factors influence your decision? Simple. Your organization&#x27;s size, the types and quantities of assets you want to track/record, and frankly, how much money you&#x27;re willing to spend. Anything else is a bonus. Does it integrate well with other platforms? Grand. Has a reasonable API? You might have str…</span>

                              <span>I’m honestly interested in this, not venting. I highly doubt 5% of the non IT workforce ever says “I have a few minutes of downtime, I’ll use that to learn something on the computer.” 
 Even if you send out tips I feel like most of them will ignore it. Either they don’t have time or it “doesn’t apply to them”. They won’t get a virus, they won’t have their password compromised, THEY won’t leave their work laptop unattended for 5 minutes at a Starbucks. 
 Has anyone ever come up with a way to get users more engaged with the technology beyond the bare minimum they need to maintain their jobs?

                              <span>Does the domain specified in the DKIM-Signature header on a SMTP message need to match or be a parent domain from the domain sending the message (e.g. MailFrom or From headers)?
 I&#x27;m working with a client trying to figure out some email deliverability issues. While investigating, I discovered one of their ESP is using their domain and not the client&#x27;s for the DKIM domain. That&#x27;s getting that switched to use my client&#x27;s domain, but I didn&#x27;t even think this was possible.
 Relevant headers from a test message showing it passing SPF (client&#x27;s domain) and DKIM (ESP&#x27;s domain):
  
Authentication-Results:
 spf&#x3D;pass (sender IP is x.x.x.x) smtp.mailfrom&#x3D;service.client.com;
 dkim&#x3D;pass (signature was verified) header.d&#x3D;esp.com; dmarc&#x3D;bestguesspass action&#x3D;none
 header.from&#x3D;client.com; compauth&#x3D;pass reason&#x3D;109
 DKIM-Signature: v&#x3D;1; a&#x3D;rsa-sha256; d&#x3D;esp.com; i&#x3D;@esp.com; s&#x3D;dkim; c&#x3D;relaxed/relaxed;
 q&#x3D;dns/txt; t&#x3D;1665520754; x&#x3D;1668112754; h&#x3D;content-transfer-encoding:content-type:subject:date:to:from:mime-version:list-unsubscribe:x-thread-info:subject:to:from:cc:reply-to;bh&#x3D;jdBAlGXcZKDm8k&#x3D;
 From: donotreply@client.com
  
If there doesn&#x27;t need to be any type of domain name alignment, what prevents a rogue actor from just putting their own DKIM-Signature there. Yeah it could be discovered...but who looks at SMTP headers of all their messages. The damage from a phishing attack or similar may have already been done.

 Configure Microsoft Edge for Windows with policy settings | Microsoft Learn 
 Using a domain admin account, I navigated to \\DC\sysvol\Domain\Policies and I have a lot of items in there but no policydefinitions folder. So I created it along with the EN-US subfolder and then put the ADML file. Then when I go to edit my existing Edge GPO, under administrative templates I now have no settings at all. I reverted the change and it&#x27;s back to what it was, but any idea what I&#x27;m doing wrong?

                              <span>I inherited an EMC VNXe3300 years back and have decided I&#x27;d like to just sell it for parts, as I have no personal need for it. I&#x27;d like to be able to get into the device and securely format all of the data on all of the drives before I sell them.
 The problem is, I cannot get into the interface, and I no longer have access to the EMC/Dell support portal to get the connection utility. I also do not have a miniDBB9 serial cable to connect to the unit, and those cables are ridiculously expensive. Same with SAS USB enclosures.
 Can anyone recommend a cheap way to wipe these drives so I can sell them?
 Thanks!
 EDIT: I don&#x27;t have access to a server to throw these drives in. All i have access to currently is a laptop.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for some general input as I&#x27;m having trouble coming up with reasons for a specific implementation use case.
 Assumptions:
 - All network access requires Machine Auth 802.1x
 - VLANs separate various computer groups
 - Currently we have a VLAN for Corp WiFi and Corp Network (wired computers)
 - Devices at each branch will never surpass a /23 which is what the corp network (wired computers) is configured for
 - Only the devices which also have the access to join Corp Network (wired) can connect to WiFi
 - Max Devices connected to a single AP would be 50 devices
 ​
 Question:
 Is there any reason why a corp devices which connects via 802.1x WiFi should be put on a separate VLAN or would it be advisable just to join them to the same VLAN they&#x27;d join if they were wired?
 ​
 I&#x27;ve seen every business I&#x27;ve worked for separate these networks but while thinking of it I can&#x27;t really decide why this is happening. I guessed it could be something to do with limiting broadcasts but I&#x27;m not sure.

We have security groups to limit access to shared drives, folders and files so this feature is unnecessary and often times problematic. I&#x27;m looking for a way to either disable this feature in the O365 admin portal or via GPO. Poking around in the admin portal hasn&#x27;t turned anything up for me so far. Anyone here have any experience in dealing with this? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Some of my users are on the road a lot, and while the standard built in antennas on Verizon&#x27;s jetpacks are OK for most areas, we&#x27;re having issues in specific spots at certain times of day. Talking to my users, here is what they are experiencing:
  
Still getting 4 bars of service
 Intermittent connection drops (download/upload arrows go away) despite the 4 bars remaining
 Apps that require a constant connection drop and need to be logged into again
 Moving the unit around seems to reacquire download/upload (possibly placebo effect)
  
I&#x27;m looking into solutions to improve their connection. What I&#x27;m not clear on is what the issue is. Doing a bit of research leads me to believe this might be more of an issue of traffic congestion on the tower they are connecting to, or signal interference due to being in a busy area/time of day, than the connection to the tower itself, since they are still getting full bars but receiving poor quality connection.
 Would a signal boosting antenna even help in this case? To me it sounds more like there&#x27;s too much interference and/or the towers are too busy in these locations and times of day.

 I gave this IP statically to a different workstation, and got the same result. Changing the IP of the original workstation to anything else in the subnet, resolves the issue.
 The IP is 10.20.9.1/21. We have Cisco switches.
 I&#x27;m not really sure what else to even check, my Wireshark experience is very limited but I couldn&#x27;t tell anything wrong from there. Only thing I noticed was that two of the SVI gateways had the same mac address? Not sure if that could be the issue. Tried rebooting the switches overnight and that didn&#x27;t fix it either.

                              <span>Hi Guys, 
 We&#x27;re in the process of configuring various parts of Intune and currently use SCCM. All our devices are now enrolled into Into intune and are Hybrid Azure AD Joined.
 I’m trying to get Windows Update notification popups working for all our Windows 10 devices enrolled into Intune, but can’t seem to find the right settings. Currently we have the small restart icon at the bottom right in the task bar but we want to have a pop-up notification so users will be notified in a more obvious way. I think the problem is the following setting in the Advanced Windows Update Settings on all devices. 
 &#x27;Show a notification when your PC requires a restart to finish updating&#x27; 
 This is grayed out and looks to be set to ‘Off’ but I cannot find where this setting is controlled. As these are all Hybrid Joined devices in Co-management I’ve checked through Group Policy and in our Update Rings policy and Windows Update Configuration Policy but I cant find where to enable this setting.
 Does anyone know where this setting is?

 I&#x27;ve been told by our supplier that we can just use M365 Business Standard with Enterprise Mobility + Security E3 for these new users. Is this possible or does this breach Microsoft&#x27;s licensing?
 Edit: think my suspicions were correct the licence limit is collective according to MS...

                              <span>No excuses, here. We continue to miss Microsoft&#x27;s advisory&#x27;s. The latest was us missing the basic authentication deprecation. I&#x27;m embarrassed to say we had ~10% of our user base using basic auth and those users had trouble getting mail yesterday. 
 We&#x27;re a small IT Team, and we&#x27;re working hard to get more resources. However, I still think we can improve with the team we have. I&#x27;m curious how you guys deal with Microsoft messaging and how you proactively get ahead of service interruptions. 
 Accountability isn&#x27;t a problem, we just need to get better and avoid the &quot;hey did you see that email/dashboard message?&quot; That&#x27;s the plan right now, just making sure we take turns being proactive about reading a distro and heading to the health dashboard. 
 What do you guys do? Any fancy technology or process to get advised and take action?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have a client who has just bought himself a new mac book running MacOS 12. When I have gotten the device connected into their file shares running on their on prem Server 2012R2. Whenever he creates a folder on the server it will appear immediately, however if he tries to add or edit a file the changes will take up to 3 minutes to show on the server. The changes can take place almost immediately or after a few minutes (almost like it has some kind of polling rate?)
 Interestingly enough if he tries to change a file somebody else is accessing then it will duplicate and show a &#x27;°&#x27; at the end of the duplicate file.
 I have searched up on the Internet and could see that there were numerous other people having similar problems online specifically with using SMB with this version of MacOS.
 It is worth noting he still has his old mac book that can use the file shares without issue.
 I have tried creating a separate file share and setting the permissions with full access for everyone but still experiencing the same problems.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated. And I can provide any further details if needed.
 Thanks.

 in our company (about 240 meeting rooms) we have a malfunction that it is not possible to book a room directly. 
 You mostly get a tentative message back and the Delegates needs to approve it. As a temporary workaround, all users are now able to book any room.
 All the BookIns worked normal before we updated our Exchange OnPrem-Server to the new SU August and activated Extended Protection. We have a Exchange-Hybrid-Environment. 
 Is anyone else having this issure? Thanks for all answers.

                              <span>I got several cases, where users complain that after Monthly patches being installed they see only one notification from Software Center (Config Manager), it&#x27;s the last one which gives them 15 minutes to a forced reboot. It was not a case for everyone so I started digging and I found that it happens only for people who use the &quot;Focus Assist&quot; feature in Windows 10 (former name &quot;Quiet hours&quot;). So it was obvious that people who have set &quot;Alarms only&quot; won&#x27;t see the reboot notifications, but there is also an option called &quot;Priority only&quot;, where you can select applications that can show notifications - this works well when the user chooses Software Center as a priority app manually, via the GUI.
 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone knows a way to centrally add items to the priority applications list (via GPO or script)?
 The ideal solution would be to:
  
Disable &quot;Alarms only&quot; mode in Focus Assist
 have a possibility to add &quot;Software Center&quot; to the priority list applications

 i need to configure an Domain Trust with a different site which has its own IT.
 I dont want them to see and configure anything on our site/Domain, thats why i want to implement an External Domain Trust - Non-Transitive with Selective Authentication.
 I set it up in my lab and the only thing i dont understand is, how the other Domain should make use of the Selective Authentication when he doesnt have access to our Domain to select the Users which should be able to authenticate on their resources.
 When i click on the resource domain on ntfs settings, i can change the location to the other Domain but will be prompted for credentials access it.
 How can i manage it so the other Site can configure their Selective Authentication without Domain Credentials from my Domain?
 i cant really find any resource on that.. Just some Videos where they enter the Domain Admin from the Domain, which is a huge security concern for me.
 ​
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hey guys, just seeking advice here.
 My IT team has recently been hired to work at a 1300+ user school and have taken over the whole operation from the old staff. It’s a mix of around 300 BYOD laptops and 1000 supplied Windows laptops.
 The virtual infrastructure is an absolute mess. Blends of Server 2012/2016 VM’s running on an outdated ESXI host.
 We would like to rebuild the VM’s for starters (File/Print, DC1, DC2, NPS) but we’re not sure how to do this to minimise downtime, especially for the BYOD devices.
 The file/print server would be the biggest headache. Next would be cutting over NPS and making sure all of the devices connect up okay.
 How do you even begin to do this to prevent any downtime/issues with a site of this scale?

                              <span>This problem stumps me and my colleagues to no end...
 I&#x27;m hoping someone here can help think this through?
 One of our endusers has the problem where his ethernet connection drops at random intervals, and his Wi-Fi doesn&#x27;t pick up the slack automatically either.
 Here&#x27;s what we tried:
  
New UTP cable
 New docking station
 Connected the cable directly (without docking station)
 Gave him another laptop (issue occurs on 2 laptops now)
 Colleagues tried the same outlets/the same cables, and they can work just fine
  
There are no overarching GPOs on his laptop that cause this.
 One thing we saw was that his domain firewall profile was set to ON while it should be OFF.
 That can&#x27;t be the cause because it was the same for me and I have no issues whatsoever.
 I started checking winevt logs.
 We can pinpoint when the system dropped UTP and the user had to manually connect to Wi-Fi instead:
 A request was made to authenticate to a wireless network.
 Logged: 12/10/2022 11:05:32
 Checked the Security winevt logs; all we saw was the firewall started to check all policies right after the system lost UTP connection. After Googling possible ethernet drop issues I wanted to disable the Energy/Green Energy/Wake on Magic settings in his ethernet adapter to see if that could help, but I can&#x27;t reach his device right now. When he&#x27;s forced to make a manual switch to Wi-Fi we have to reverse connect to his laptop and then run an ipconfig /registerdns before we can continue troubleshooting (most likely due to the fact we are in the middle of a DNS server cutover and those managing the transfer are veggies...).
 Even though, these are all things that shouldn&#x27;t transfer from one laptop to another yet he&#x27;s had the problem on 2 laptops one after the other now.
 Anyone have any clue on what could be causing this issue?

 For the script to run with the right permissions it has to run as a Domain Admin User, but my Domain Admins are not allowed to logon as a Batch Job.
 Should I allow these users to do so?
 My gut tells that that is a bad idea security-wise.

 Thinking of purchase 3 of these for my office. Small business, small setup.
 Was going to go with the HP Elitedesk 800 G9 but this is $600 cheaper.
 How are the Inte NUCs these days?

 Im trying to find a &quot;secure&quot; method of monitoring systems. Ive until now used PRTG and monitor almost entirely over SNMP but have now been told I cannot use SNMPv2 and instead should use v3 (encrypted) which Windows doesnt support. So I need to move product and looking for recommendations. 
 Thanks for reading.

 I’ve got my first interview today for a job where I’ll be working in Systems for the first 12 months, then after that it’ll be primarily a second line / networks / jack of all trades.
 Can anyone offer me any advice? I’m extremely nervous for this :)
 Edit to clarify - this is my first systems related interview, not first interview in general :)

                              <span>Let&#x27;s put aside the fact that throughout the years whenever I faced a problem with CPU usage/high clock I usually faced a 95+ System idle. I faced similar situations on Linux with 100% of the cases ending in htop (linux command) showing me the exact culprit. If not by CPU usage then by CPU wakes.
 Recently my opinion solidified when facing the highest CPU usage I&#x27;ve ever seen on Windows 10 on my laptop. This time I knew the culprit upfront (broken windows search, confirmed by windows reliability history error messages). Windows Search constantly banged the CPU and failed to start, CPU die constantly at 65 deg C. As soon as I fixed Windos Search the CPU die temperature dropped to ~40 deg C! The thing is the entire time neither of the built-in Windows Tools (including the Sysinternals Process Explorer) showed any useful information on the issue. No listed component spiked to more than 3-5% of CPU. Even the memory usage tab in Resource Monitor was better at hinting the culprit than the releavant CPU sections!
 What are your thoughts?

                              <span>Hi all,
 So I&#x27;m in a little bit of a strange discussion with our manager. 
 We need a CMDB and in his opinion Intune should be the CMDB. 
 I do not know the right way for a CMDB, but Intune sounds not right.
 What&#x27;s your opinion?

                              <span>Opinion &amp; Advice - Cloud / Network
 Hi All! I’ve got a bit of a decision to make….stay in my current role or move out.
 I have a significant background in networking (17yrs) and transitioned to a leadership position as a manager of the network team at my current company. 
 Recently, I was given an opportunity to transition from networking to cloud due to an organizational re-alignment. So I’ve been spending my recent days learning our Cloud platform, Terraform, CI/CD, etc….
 I knew this was going to be a big challenge - but it would come with big opportunities - especially for future growth. It’s been less than a year and things aren’t going great in the role. I have a new leader and everything just feels disorganized and faltering. Our Cloud strategy isn’t strategic and i feel like im fighting against the tide (ex. Let’s migrate everything..Cloud is simple).
 Even the new direction the company is taking has me concerned about its long term viability.
 I have an opportunity to transition back to a Network Manager role with a different company. I love networking!
 My concern…am I making a short term and short sighted move? Cloud is 100% in more demand that networking. Will I look back in 5yrs or 10yrs and kick myself? Should I stick it out at my current company (10yrs seniority) and hope for the best and gain as much experience I can as a Cloud Manager….which isn’t a lot of hands on exposure.
 On the other hand I go into work each day fearing for my job, I’m not happy, and I’m starting to worry that if I wait too long the job market might shift shortly that might result in limited opportunities.
 Looking for the opinion of my peers 😊

 I almost configured two different network connections into a server, Both IPs seem to access the internet just fine, I can curl IP check and ping both by IP. However on my T-Mobile gateway I cannot seem to ping 8.8.8.8 DNS through the sever, only on my laptop... 
 Im pretty sure I followed these directions to a tee
 (https://serverspace.us/support/help/multiple-network-interfaces-centos-7/)
 Any reason particular reason I cant ping one of my connections through google DNS or even cloudflare? Thanks!

                              <span>Our company has a remote site that needs to talk to corporate. We have one MPLS circuit and one internet circuit. When the MPLS circuit goes down we’d like a failover and failback option. A couple of issues, when MPLS goes down, the link does always go down with it, so a link-state protocol is not the most reliable. Our equipment does NOT support IP SLA. Any advice? We’re hoping to not buy any new equipment right now or gut our entire network at both sites with suitable routers. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I need to implement DHCP snooping in my production environment and have a question about it. I understand it needs to go on the access switches and their upstream links to the core of the network but do I also need to put it on the uplink of every device until I get to the DHCP server? Or is it just needed on the source of the originating request and the interface connected to the DHCP server? Sorry if that’s a mouthful. I’m just hesitant to push to production if I don’t understand the big picture

with XR7 &#x27;commit replace&#x27; is basically &#x27;write erase&#x27; it deletes the whole config.
 &#x27;load harddisk:configfile.txt&#x27; is merging with existing config.
  
Is there a way to do replace the entire config in a single step? something like this: &#x27;commit replace harddisk:newconfig.txt confirmed 180&#x27;
 I sort of found a way with xrreplace in ZTP_helpers but wondering if there&#x27;s a simpler/better way to do it.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen a couple of issues where the built-in TDR cable test on a Meraki MS120 switch reports cable length of over 100 meters when the actual length is 40 meters or less. Right now I&#x27;m looking at one where a MR70 AP is connected and can only get 100 Mbps. The cable test shows an estimated length of 120.75 meters and no connection on pairs 3 &amp; 4. The tech on site had a basic connectivity tester and showed good connectivity on all conductors. Considering where the switch and AP are, I can&#x27;t imagine the actual cable length being much over 25 meters even with a service loop. (I don&#x27;t expect the built-in test to be super accurate on cable length, but being like 500% high is a bit much.)
 Has anyone else seen cable issues that cause such high length reports and know what kind of things might cause it?

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 We&#x27;re getting close to having to replace our current SDWAN solution due to the vendor EOLing the product. Currently we use it to tie all our remote site DIAs into a tunnel back to 2 central sites for our workers there to access central resources, with all the SDWAN goodies thrown in as well. 
 We already have FGT firewalls at all our sites and will most likely continue to use them in the future. Currently we use their SLAs and other traffic steering features that their SDWAN presents at face value, but are the advanced features comparable to a full SDWAN solution that would provide a tunnel back to a central location? 
 We&#x27;re a pretty big SDWAN shop, I&#x27;d like to utilize our current hardware but if it can&#x27;t match up to something independent like Cisco&#x27;s or Riverbed then we will have to explore that route instead (I really would like to avoid Cisco SDWAN, had enough of a time w/ that in the updated CCNP).

                              <span>I operate a regional ISP. We have a core network comprised of two datacenters, with two MX240 routers each. From these MX240 routers, we peer with three IP transit providers (20Gbps circuits each). We also are a member of a peering exchange where we peer with a couple dozen CDNs. 
 High level network architecture overview: We have a single VRF that we use to deliver internet services. Our eBGP sessions with the peering members, as well as the IP transit providers, terminate inside this VRF. We have a BGP-free core where our customers throughout our network also terminate inside this VRF. Our customers receive static public IP addresses. The backbone of our network is IS-IS for the IGP, LDP for label distribution. We run iBGP between each PE (at customer premises) and our 4 core MX routers …</span>

                              <span>We recently expanded our network and I added a small 8-port managed switch for a few clients. I set up the VLANs to match (I think).
 Current &quot;links in the chain&quot; are:
  
Core switch: TP-Link T1600G-52PS, codename &quot;Colonel&quot;
 SFP module LC/UPC (TP-Link TL-SM311LS)
 60M OS2 single mode fiber (SMF) LC/LC patch cable from Amazon.
 Access switch: TP-Link TL-SG2210MP, codename &quot;Sarge&quot;
  
The SFP module and the cable seem to be compatible and connected fine with an audible *click*.
 VLANS:
  
80: Management. Each managed switch has a static IP in subnet 80: 
 Core&#x3D;192.168.80.4
 OtherSwitch1&#x3D;192.168.80.5
 OtherSwitch2&#x3D;192.168.80.6
 Sarge&#x3D;192.168.80.7
 
 90: Staff devices. This VLAN includes clients connected to the new switch.
 Other access switches also have the same 2 VLANs configured.

 I gave this IP statically to a different workstation, and got the same result. Changing the IP of the original workstation to anything else in the subnet, resolves the issue.
 The IP is 10.20.9.1/21. We have Cisco switches.
 I&#x27;m not really sure what else to even check, my Wireshark experience is very limited but I couldn&#x27;t tell anything wrong from there. Only thing I noticed was that two of the SVI gateways had the same mac address? Not sure if that could be the issue. Tried rebooting the switches overnight and that didn&#x27;t fix it either.

                              <span>So, I&#x27;m currently a mid level manager at a small ISP. I recently started looking for new roles and have been offered what seems like a great opportunity.
 The offer is for a network manager role at a more senior level. Its again a small ISP, the network needs a lot of work, a full redesign. Which is exciting. Fully remote, occasional on site meetings. I do have my doubts about work load as I&#x27;d basically be architect and people manager.
 I&#x27;ve accepted and signed the contract.
 But then, yesterday, another role that I&#x27;d been waiting on for a while finally came through. This job would push me harder from a technical perspective, but it comes with no seniority. It also requires 3 days a week in the office and would be far less flexible. Did feel more rapport with the interviewers here. 
 I know only I can make this decision. But any tips on how I make it?! They both have their pros and cons, they both offer good progression for my career one way or another. Can&#x27;t stop thinking about it and still not getting any closer to making a decision!

                              <span>Hello people, we have been using ACI for 3 years. In first year we used it as big l2 switch, later we implemented ospf l3outs and became gateway for some networks and now we implemented PBR to selectively forward traffic to PBR firewall. PBR has become game changer for us as security guys no more has to deal with unnecessary chunk of traffic which makes firewall use resources to the limit. Now while http traffic between two servers is being redirected to firewall, logging traffic between same servers forwarded directly by ACI thanks to specific contracts.
 We are thinking on what else we can implement on ACI to make life easier. How do you use ACI?

                              <span>Hi all, I have a UDM Pro SE which has fiber on WAN1 and a 4G router on WAN2 (a Teltonika RUT241).
 The 4G router does CGNAT, so in order to easily reach the Web GUI for admin purposes I&#x27;ve installed ZeroTier on it and it works well, I can reach it from a LAN device (a mac mini) with ZeroTier installed.
 BUT, Tailscale works so much better for me, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m using on all other devices (the 4G router doesn&#x27;t support Tailscale, only ZeroTier).
 My question is if I can somehow bride the LAN to the ZeroTier network using the mac mini as a bridge since it has a network interface for both networks? When I&#x27;m inside my LAN using Tailscale I&#x27;d like to route traffic to the Zerotier network (192.168.192.0/24) via the mac mini.
 I&#x27;m guessing I should setup a static route, pointing traffic going to the destination network 192.168.192.0/24 through the LAN device on 192.168.5.142 (the mac mini), but do I need to do something on the mac mini to make this work?

                              <span>I think I know the answer to this because it&#x27;s glaringly obvious from the error message.. But is it possible to run esp-gcm 256 on an ASR1002? When I try configure it I get an error:
 Transform set NGE-ESP-GCM disabled because esp-gcm 256 is not supported by encryption hardware
 I&#x27;m just posting in the hope that I&#x27;ve missed something and it could maybe be enabled somehow.
 According to this doc, it should be possible.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi,
 Not sure if I’m somehow missing it, but we’re implementing some 80KM dark fiber and we purchased some 100G 80KM QSFP28 modules at 1310nm. However, the loss is a bit high (no link possible) so we wanted to try 1550nm which of course has better attenuation figures, but I can’t locate any QSFP28 100G modules operating at 1550nm??
 Funnily enough though I have found posts in this subreddit with people saying that at 80KM all DWDM modules will be 1550nm - but the exact opposite seems to be true.
 The loss over the link appears to be about 23-26dBm according to our 10G 1650nm 80KM modules, so I’d expect at 1310 it’s closer to 36db of loss.
 I assume the recommendation would be EDFA, but any other suggestions for reliable 100G over this link would be appreciated :)
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi All, 
 I&#x27;m running a small scale test on 802.1x in preparation for a company-wide rollout. We&#x27;re using Cisco catalyst + Microsoft NPS with EAPTLS. On the Windows side of thing everything is working flawlessly but I&#x27;m struggling to get a working MAB policy on NPS for the IP Phones (This model does not support 802.1x) 
 I have seen a few methods of configuring MAB on NPS. One involves setting up a user with username/password as the MAC address. This wont work in my environment as the password is just getting rejected due to complexity requirements. 
 The 2nd method I have seen involves setting up a connection request policy like so : 
 Conditions: 
  
NAS Port Type &#x3D; Ethernet
 Calling Station ID &#x3D; ^00-00-00-00-00$|^11-11-11-11-11$ 
  
Authentication: 
  
&#x27;Accept users without verifying credentials&#x27;
  
The the switchport is configured like so: 
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1 description Access-Port switchport access vlan 101 switchport mode access switchport voice vlan 107 access-session host-mode multi-domain access-session closed access-session port-control auto mab dot1x pae authenticator spanning-tree portfast spanning-tree bpduguard enable service-policy type control subscriber DOT1X2MAB end 
 When connecting the PC works fine, but the IP phone is failing , then the switchport gets err disabled as a result. Is anyone able to advise on where I am going wrong ? Documentation on MAB in NPS seems to be lacking

                              <span>I&#x27;m in a bind to look for an elegant solution to get the following failover solution working and I wondered if anyone here might have any ideas? 
 Diagram as follows : Diagram 
 Simple two site setup with both sites having their own WAN link for internet as well as site to site connectivity. 
 The MPLS wans are setup with eBGP so each Cisco router receives the prefix of the other site via that WAN link for reachability to each other. 
 The LANs of both routers are setup with two subnets and are setup using VRRP. with each router acting as the active VRRP group for each subnet: 
 Site1 : 192.168.1.254
 Site2 : 192.168.0.254
 VRRP is setup so in the event of the WAN going down the other router takes over as VRRP master. 
 This means that as well as resilience that both WAN links are fully utilised instead of all traffic just using the one WAN link. All good! 
 The issue is that due to the point to point interface and VRRP that if the point to point dies so site1 can no longer reach site2 using the point to point that you would want that traffic to go out via the WAN into the MPLS to reach the other site. 
 The problem is of course it won&#x27;t do that due to each of the Cisco routers having LAN&#x27;s which belong to both subnets. So if traffic was going from Site1 to Site2 then as soon as those packets destined for 192.168.0.0/24 hit the Site1 router then it would just not send it out&#x27;s its WAN as it has an interface belonging to that subnet which is up and part of the VRRP group. 
 This is the problem I&#x27;m trying to solve. A solution which I don&#x27;t like is to create a EMM script which will shut down that LAN in the event traffic is no longer using the P2P but I don&#x27;t like how messy that could be. 
 Anyone got any ideas or suggestions then I&#x27;m open to them :) 
 I hope that made at least some sense?

                              <span>We are basically sailing this boat until we move to a new office and will replace all the network equipment. We have a weird issue with the DHCP server. Every time we onboard a new user and plug in their new device it just gives us a unidentified network. But any other user on the network that was there a couple months back can get an address. I&#x27;ve tried statically assigning the wired endpoints with no luck. The other weird thing is when we connect to the Main wifi, it states not internet and when I statically assign an unused IP address, it then works just fine. We have 3 managed switches that I have tried plugging my laptop directly in and still have no luck.

                              <span>Looking to get some confirmation on how to best proceed here. Will be migrating items from two source locations to M365 GCC/Gov&#x27;t Tenant as the destination (hence the reason I am migrating to a new tenant). Destination M365 tenant will be cloud only/no AD Connect in place. 
 Source locations and use are:
  
Google Workspace -mail, contacts, calendars, Drive data - migrating using BitTitan (no issues here and the migration is already pre-staged/processing)
 M365 Commercial/Non Gov&#x27;t Tenant- Used for MS Office licensing and small bit of unexpected OneDrive use. This tenant uses AD Connect to sync users to local AD at the moment and has the company domain name in use as the primary domain for all users.
  
I am planning on performing this migration this weekend and need to confirm what my process should be to either disable or decommission AD Connect from the existing M365 commercial tenant but keep the users intact (just in case I need to manually move any data over)- while allowing me to remove the company domain in use on the existing M365 tenant. 
 I&#x27;m familiar on the process of decommissioning AD Connect in full, but know that can take up to 72 hours and I can&#x27;t make any changes during that time. What process should I be following if I want to make the users cloud only/change their usernames to .onmicrosoft.com addresses from the tenant so I can remove the company domain from the existing M365 tenant at the same time (hopefully in one evening?)

We seem to be able to solve it in many cases by rebuilding the OST but my mailbox, for example, loses all of my shared mailboxes and online archive after a few weeks. One, has anybody run into this? Two, if you have, have you found a solution yet?

I appreciate it greatly, but it&#x27;s just jarring. I keep expecting there to be something broken, some weird thing that is happening to their computer, or some burning question that could be answered with a google search. Maybe I just need to make more of an effort to strike up a conversation at random?

                              <span>I’m not starting an office network from scratch, but always day dream what id do different.
 What would you guys do? 2 AD servers, the rest in Azure? 100% cloud? Full data center? Okta? Domain joined devices? Identity management? File sharing? Intune?
 Edit: for the sake of this scenario.
 1) No existing network but a basic firewall, a couple WAPs, and some switches 2) No existing servers or means for identity management, users are using Box for file sharing, Google workplace for email, Office apps 3) 50 users expected to grow to 300 in the next 3 years 4) One large office, with dispersed remote employees across the country 5) Mixed environment but primary Windows, Linux and Apple sprinkled in 6) Lots of engineers, using locally installed SW applications 7) IT Staff: 2 man show
 Like to hear your thoughts!

                              <span>A few years back there was a post here from a traveling data center technician in NYC(?). I may be a bit murky on the details but he had a portable standing desk for data center work. From what I remember, it was basically a platform with a single telescoping pole in the center with a rubber foot on the bottom. It came apart easily and packed into a backpack so he could travel from data center to data center working. There was a link to it and it was a small company making these specifically for technician field work. 
 Does anyone have any idea what I&#x27;m talking about? I&#x27;ve searched and have been unable to find anything beyond cheap plasticy tripod options on Amazon that don&#x27;t look like they&#x27;ll hold up for professional use.

                              <span>Assumptions are the root of all evil.
 I constantly screw myself on a daily basis by making assumptions. I can&#x27;t count the amount of times where I have been handed an issue by a junior tech and started working on more complex solutions but in the end it was something simple that someone forgot to check or assumed was correct.
 The only safe assumption is that no one has done anything correctly ever and everyone is lying to you. Users will make things sound extremely severe to get a problem solved quicker, techs will make assumptions and pass those assumptions on to you. If you haven&#x27;t seen that information yourself, then you&#x27;re working off of a paper foundation in the middle of a hurricane. I know this sounds extremely pessimistic, but Dr. House was right all along.
 The amount of time wasted double-checking something is almost never as long as the amount of time wasted trying to solve a problem that you may already know the solution too.

                              <span>Hey everyone, seems like I should be swimming in solutions here, but I&#x27;m struggling a bit. Company is standing up a new enterprise application that is going to be the backbone of the organization. Needs to be extremely highly available and fully support blue/green deployments. The application has a content storage component that just needs to point to an NFS share. Making that NFS share highly available / fully redundant is an exercise left to the implementer, and I&#x27;m waffling a bit on deciding what makes sense.
 Solution needs to be fully replicated, clustered, and highly available (instant failover either during outage or during deployments). We also need to be able to support our DR process which currently is replicating on prem VMware VMs to Azure.
 We were going to go with GlusterFS, but just found out that Redhat has killed that product and we definitely want enterprise support for whatever solution we choose. Their replacement, Cephs, seems to be way overkill for what we need.
 Would love some suggestions! Thanks!

                              <span>People are rightfully sensitive about their name, whether the pronunciation, gender, salutation (mr, mrs, MD, PHD, III) etc. We get many tickets requesting a name change to reflect the user&#x27;s preference, I get it.
 The problem is we don&#x27;t control what an app (Teams, Outlook, 1000 in house apps, 300 SaaS apps, and more) chooses to use.
 From LDAP alone the apps can get SN, CN, givenName, lastName, displayName, etc. Then you have HR legal name, Peoplesoft preferred name, etc.
 Edit: add job title to the mix while we are at it.
 We just can&#x27;t force all apps to use the same source. And if we did, the name would still be wrong from the user&#x27;s perspective many times.

                              <span>this is more of a vent if anything. I think this move Zoom made to rebrand &#x27;Chat&#x27; to &#x27;Team Chat&#x27; was such an oversight. Idk if their marketing people and PMs have no idea what they are doing. or if they simply don&#x27;t care to review changes. 
 My first gripe:
 the changed the name to Team chat. gag. 
  
there is already a product called... teams. nice move Zoom
 not everyone who i am messaging is part of my &#x27;team&#x27;- like someone from a different team or an external person like my sales rep. it would have made 100% more sense to call this Company Chat. 
 there reason for doing this was because people got &#x27;confused&#x27; when using meeting chat vs Zoom Chat. So they changed it for everyone because the free users and guest users got confused. lol
  
But this is the part that got me. is this blog post:
 https://blog.zoom.us/work-better-together-with-zoom-team-chat/
 they try to talk about &#x27;toggle tax&#x27; and then try to justify not using email and just use Zoom Team chat. This is a major SMH 
 &quot;Need to share an important design and the context behind it with a colleague? Don’t break focus by signing into your email account and drafting an email — simply pop into Team Chat, type up a message, attach the file at the click of a button, and hit send!&quot; 
 Can&#x27;t say i have ever had an app tell me &quot;use our app to talk instead of sending an email&quot; that shit is funny. who writes this shit.

                              <span>Just a general discussion really. We are looking to set up a hybrid Azure AD system, as we use 365 but still have various on prem required software, and whilst watching a Microsoft video on the subject, they are trying to suggest people move away from on prem entirely, unless they&#x27;re using software or older systems that explicitly require it. Is this just Microsoft trying to sell Azure and 365, or is it much more of a trend than I initially thought?
 For smaller companies, I don&#x27;t see any reason not to use Azure, but it strikes me that even with a full Azure AD and Endpoint Manager suite of tools, you still lose out on a lot of configuration that group policies offer, albeit it with other advantages too

 I understand &quot;it&#x27;s not new it&#x27;s a skin&quot; and other comments - but really that&#x27;s all windows ever is since Vista came out... 
 Why is it not in their mindset to create a new base build number instead of just progressing 10.something... especially when it is officially labeled differently with &quot;11&quot; in the title now? 
 I feel like I&#x27;m having a stroke running reports and looking at SCCM in general when it still says windows 10 on some things when I&#x27;m certain those are 11 machines now, etc... so frustrating. /rant.

                              <span>My employer hired an MSP to assist with the workload fulfilling T1 requests and more at first. This arrangement has not been working out. All users and management involved agree they are not working out. Even the MSP admitted they are challenged and had to resolve personnel issues internally. I&#x27;m putting aside the fact that initially my whole job description was presented to me on a PPT slide with their name on top before they came aboard months ago and hopes were high. Management has since tried to break the contract unsuccessfully. So, the plan from management was to not make any changes in user support (damage control?) but to collect enough complaints from our users to build a case against the MSP that we can possibly use to cancel the contract. The issue here is that we are quite lite…</span>

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I am looking into refreshing our core switches. One question I am running into is optical vs copper. Most of my current infrastructure is copper, but the newer servers have optical ports as well. Is copper going bye bye? Will there only be optical switches in the next 5-10 years? How will I get cables with pretty cultures to satisfy my OCD?
 EDIT: By optical I mean SFP/QSFP where you can still use copper but many use the SFP+ DAC cables.
 EDIT2: just want to say I appreciate the great responses.

 Static assigned hostnames (no working DNS), NICs, IP&#x27;s and of course persistent static routes. 
 They never had L3 router in the environment to do the routing, they&#x27;ve relied on host routes lol

                              <span>Following the MS article on setting up WEF/WEC using certificate authentication. It says to create an admin user and map the issuing CA cert to the admin user. Does this mean any client using a cert issued by that CA can call into the WEC server as an admin? That seems like a big hole. I can&#x27;t find further info explaining why that user has to be an admin. I just want these clients to be able to forward their events. Any ideas? Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m configuring an Intune environment and testing with drive mappings. I have a single Z: drive using OMA-URI configurations similar to this article, initially works fine. But every day it seems to try to remap it. I end up with an inaccessible Z: drive with a red X over it saying the drive letter is already in use, and then I have a Y: drive mapped to the location the Z: drive originally was, also saying the path isn&#x27;t available.
 I have to remove both, remap Z: and it&#x27;s fine again.
 What I&#x27;m looking to do is a (hopefully) simple powershell script that maps that drive, that I can package as an app instead of a script or configuration profile.
 I can make a script that simply maps the drive with net use easy enough and send output to a file that I can use for &quot;install&quot; detection, but I feel that having a check for the existing drive letter(s) first would be best since there are plenty of already-deployed Intune machines in production that will end up getting this new &quot;app&quot;/script applied.
 I realize I&#x27;m &quot;asking for the fish&quot; here, when I&#x27;d normally prefer to learn how to fish myself, but given that this is already in production I&#x27;m hoping a few of you might have the time and be willing to help me out.
 I can do a basic script in the meantime that will just blanket remove Z: and Y:, remap Z:, and send the output somewhere the user won&#x27;t accidentally delete it, but I&#x27;m sure there are much more efficient ways to do so.
 Ultimately what I am hoping to accomplish:
  
Check existing drive mappings (I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t add a 3rd letter, so can probably focus directly on Z: and Y:)
 Remove existing mappings
 Remap Z: to the proper path
 Check Z: to confirm its accessible
 If Z: is fine, send some output to a text file that can be used for program detection so that it&#x27;s not constantly executing against the same machines

                              <span>Hello Admins!
 I have a situation where I have some clients working from home. Due to compliance, I have to prevent them from being able to talk to other devices on the network (such as home PCs, IoT devices, etc...).
 We use ESET Endpoint Antivirus and RocketCyber SIEM/SOC software. Both of those applications have an isolation mode that prevents that PC from talking to anything other than the ESET/RocketCyber console.
 Is there anyway to achieve this type of protection using only software, but still allow WAN/Internet access (so basically it can talk to the gateway and nothing else). The isolation modes in the applications I mention, prevent general WAN/Internet access as well... so they won&#x27;t work in this situation.
 However, since they are able to lock it down to a specific port/application... I assume there must be some way to do what I am describing. I searched around looking for Windows Firewall rules, but those seem to be limited to very specific protocols/ports. I would like true isolation like Wireless access points do in Guest mode.
 Since this is in multiple home networks, I don&#x27;t really have the option to create network segmentation (VLANs, etc...).
 Any help is greatly appreciated :)

                              <span>Hey everyone, 
 it seems that many employees receive fake Microsoft Support calls on their private mobile phones today. 
 Anyone else seeing something similar? What are your plans against it besides sensitizing employees?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m well versed in remote desktop, having operated several for coming up to two decades. However, this is something new to me...
 We have a customer who&#x27;s got 30-40 users within a latency of circa 5-10ms to the remote desktop session host. However, they&#x27;ve just had 4 outsourced users added from India (we&#x27;re in the UK). Each Indian user is around 150-200ms.
 When we have 40 UK-based users concurrently online, the server CPU can sit roughly at 60%. However, if you swap a couple of UK users for Indians, the server CPU will spike and sometimes sit at 90% with spikes to 100% and the associated freezes you get when out of resource.
 Strangely, this manifests itself in a Windows Explorer process taking between 10-20% CPU for each user. However, if you right-click the Windows Explorer process and choose to restart it, the user sees a brief flash on their session as the explorer is reset, and CPU usage dips back to the circa 0% that it normally uses for other users. It quickly returns to the 10-20% range though.
 I was just wondering whether anyone has noticed the correlation between client latency and server CPU usage?

                              <span>After a succesful move to Zoho Projects for Dev work, we figured we would try out their CRM. 
 I like the layout of Zoho CRM, but there are some things in our industry I am struggling to get my head round. 
 Quotes / Sales Orders do not seem to have a cost price or margin? If you are supplying a Laptop to a customer, tracking profit is crucial. 
 It does have a Services section, which is a big plus as most CRM do not. We were thinking of adding monthly services, IT Support per X users, 365 licences etc. However it seems to be hell bent on having services as a per hour item. Which means it doesnt really work. 
 Why is this always so complicated?
 Do I try to customise it, or is there something better out there?

 I&#x27;ve been tasked with repurposing a hypervisor to a file server, and we&#x27;ve got a LSI 9300-8i HBA card and our motherboard is X9QR7-TF+.
 I was able to install TrueNAS core without an issue however the disk is connected to the HBA card and It doesn&#x27;t seem to show up as a boot priority in the BIOS however I was able to install TrueNAS while it was connected to the card, has anyone else had a familiar experience?
 I&#x27;m trying to perform a BIOS firmware update however I&#x27;m not so familiar with DOS and I&#x27;m attempting to run the Bat file with difficulty xD

 Biggest issue is that the vendor must be compliant with any EU privacy laws that are in place.

                              <span>Hi there,
 I wasn&#x27;t able to find any relevant user groups except maybe for this subreddit as I saw many posts about EATON UPSses here. The device itself is working fine and I am really happy. But some tiny thing is bugging me.
 I am running an audio interface (RME Fireface UCX II) via this UPS , next to a monitor, active studio speakers and a mac studio. When I turn the outlets of this UPS off in the evening, and wait a little, I can see the display of my Fireface briefly flashing on and off again - every 30 seconds or so.
 The power doesn&#x27;t seem to cause it boot up, so I don&#x27;t see anything on the display, just the backlight briefly turning on and off for a split second.
 This doesn&#x27;t happen if my interface is connected to a different wall socket next to the EATON UPS.
 I have the EATON Ellipse ECO 1200W
 Is this anything to worry about? Can this cause wear on the electronics on high-precision audio devices like these?
 Already sent an email to EATON customer support but you know how these things are - sometimes you hear from them, sometimes you don&#x27;t. Curious to hear your input on this!
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I had a call yesterday with AT&amp;T, during which they were trying to sell me on their &quot;new&quot; Switched Ethernet solution to replace our DIA fiber. (We have multiple locations - most of which have 50mb fiber as the primary connection and some flavor of cable or non-dedicated fiber as the backup.) The proposal looked promising and would save us around $200/mo per location. There would be no managed router, and supposedly I would get an online portal where I can throttle speed in real time. Not a huge need, but an interesting proposition, none the less. Of course, the ATT rep couldn&#x27;t/wouldn&#x27;t give me any other &#x27;cons&#x27; that might be an issue and even said they could get us out of our current contracts and give us the same or better SLAs that we have now.
 So, I come to you, good people of Reddit. Who has experience with this ASEoD product, can offer insight as it compares to DIA fiber, or any other advice along these lines. Have you used this portal they speak of? Is it awesome or meh? Pros? Cons? TIA

 ​
 Which cloud service would you recommend me to use for backing up the data from my phone like photos, contacts, etc., which I can also use for my laptops? I would have 4 devices, in total, for which I would use the cloud service(s). I can use the Microsoft 365 Personal for the phone like I would use the Google One cloud service, or the single option is to use Google One for phone back-up and Microsoft 365 Personal for laptops?

                              <span>I am the IT Department in a school and I’m looking for the easiest way to roll out MS store apps to all domain joined machines.
 In this case, I’m trying to rollout the Microsoft HEVC Video Extension codec. I’ve downloaded the appx and other files and I’ve read about how to install it using powershell on a single machine, but I can’t seem to find how to install it on many machines remotely.
 I don’t have intune, our domain joined machines are connected to a local server running Windows Server 2008 (due to be replaced soon).
 Can anyone help me with a good, free method, to roll out these kinds of apps to domain joined computers?

                              <span>So let me preface this by saying that this is absolutely their choice and I&#x27;m not going to try to stop them, I just want to see if there is an alternative.
 The company I work for has been purchased by another company in another continent. It&#x27;s a really good business move for all involved. We&#x27;re now talking about the collaboration between our IT departments, and they would like to migrate into their 365 tenant, which they have done for all of their previous acquisitions.
 I don&#x27;t inherently have an issue with this, but we are considerably larger than their previous acquisitions, and utilise O365 a lot more than these smaller companies (and it sounds like we utilize more than the new parent does with regards to Azure and Intune/Autopilot, etc.).
 I did a very brief stint at an MSP before working here, and there we used some kind of Partner Portal to look after all of our 365 tenants. Is this something that the parent company can do and onboard our tenant as a whole, separate entity? I thought this was the case, but the more I look at it, the more it looks like the Partner Centre scheme is something for resellers (which the parent isn&#x27;t, but the aim is for them to provide licences to us, along with collaboration on projects, so there might be some overlap there).
 Am I barking up the wrong tree here and have the wrong idea about the Partner Centre? Is there something else I should be looking at and have been searching for the wrong terminology? Or is them merging us into their tenant the best practice here?

I worry that if I go for a different supplier of wired internet as a backup then they could potentially both go down at once by say roadworks in the area or other external factors. Is this sensible to worry about or would different suppliers have their own routes to the building? should my backup connection be wireless?

                              <span>As you already maybe know, last month Microsoft made a mistake and pushed &quot;Preview&quot; updated to WSUS server. More info can be found here: Windows Server 2022 | Microsoft Learn 
 ​
 So all OK so far, Preview updates by default are not pushed to WSUS.
 But If we have Azure VMs, and they use Azure Update Management and for the repository they use Microsoft Update, we will probably get this &quot;Preview&quot; updates by default or not?
 Since we want to get rid of WSUS for the Azure VMs, what will actually happened...?
 If we have for example test environments on WSUS which are without &quot;Preview&quot; updates and then for production use Azure, we are going to have different updates installed there... How do you solve this in your environments, should we also deploy WSUS to Azure, or include preview updates on test environments?

                              <span>Sorry for the wall of text, but I feel like I&#x27;m lost. Looking for some advice.
 I&#x27;ve been WFH for about 2.5 years now and have bounced between 3 MSPs in that time. I&#x27;ve been in the field for over 20 years and have had longevity prior to the pandemic;7 years at one place, 2-3 years at the others. I typically move on every few years for the bump in pay (as we all know that&#x27;s the only way to get it done).
 Here is what I&#x27;ve experienced since mid 2020:
 Org 1: Had an amazing infrastructure, good management, and very few political issues within the team. Only problem was that they asked us to remain steadfast during the pandemic because they couldn&#x27;t afford to give us a raise. After things had calmed down and people began returning to the office, we were told they couldn&#x27;t get approval for rais…</span>

Some people had been doing IT stuff kinda on their own, some of them rage-quit at some point, nothing was ever documented. At all. Who handles what, who handles this or that account, where passwords are, or who knows passwords for this or that service... Nothing. At. All.
 The non-profit uses Google tools. Instead of Google Groups, shared accounts had been created, with forwarding rules created as filters. Good luck to the admin when trying to figure out who receives what. In the previous guy&#x27;s defense, this may have been done because we didn&#x27;t have a license that would let us store messages in Google Groups (we now have the correct license).
 Some accounts were created to circumvent the fact that w…</span>

 We are lookingfor a .iso file that we can flash onto our virtual platform from which we then can the boot the server.

                              <span>We have been struggeling with the Windows startbutton not working on our RDS 2019 servers for a while now. The weird thing is, this only happens for regular users, not admin users. I have been searching online and found that I could run the following command: 
  
Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode –Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”} 
  
This doesn&#x27;t work for me because it gets blocked by applocker. Also in the eventviewer under &#x27;Applications and Service Logs/Microsoft/Windows/AppXDeployment-server&#x27; I see a lot of errors regarding packages that cannot be installed/updated due to applocker restrictions. Example of the error: 
  
AppX Deployment operation failed for package Microsoft.Windows.SecHealthUI_10.0.17763.3232_neutral__cw5n1h2txyewy with error 0x80073D01. The specific error text for this failure is: error 0x800704EC: Deployment of package Microsoft.Windows.SecHealthUI_10.0.17763.3232_neutral__cw5n1h2txyewy was blocked by AppLocker.
  
I tried to allow the packages in our applocker GPO and reboot the servers, but that didn&#x27;t fix the issue either.

 I also tried to delete the firewall rules in the registery, but that does not seem to work either.

 Anyone else have been struggeling with this?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m looking for a convenient way to test a change in an existing GPO. I am a bit of a rookie, but i cant seem to find a way to do test the change on a single test OU. Any advice is appreciated. Unlinking the GPO is not an alternative sadly.

                              <span>Ridiculous task of the week, we&#x27;ve been tasked with securing access to Office 365 for someone using a personal MacBook. With Windows 10 of course, we would Azure register the device and use MAM in Intune/Endpoint Manager with Windows Information Protection. And of course on iPads, iPhones, and Android phones, there&#x27;s app policies available too
 Obviously this is not something we can do with Mac. And as it&#x27;s a BYOD laptop, we are not at liberty to lock the entire laptop down. Is there any sort of data protection policy or software we can use with Mac, or are we SOL? They&#x27;re basically just going to be using Office and OneDrive
 Edit: I did find this from MS, which seems to offer some level of support, but as commenters have already stated, it&#x27;s just a terrible idea and I&#x27;m going to strongly make that point

                              <span>Hi All,
 Wondering if there are any recommendations fellow sys admins have when it comes to professional password managers for a team? We&#x27;re only small but would ideally like all members of the team to have access to the same password vault for admin accounts etc. Doesn&#x27;t need to be anything special, just easy to setup and use ideally.
 Thanks in advanced.

                              <span>So i have a problem with Office 2013 activation.
 We had an old 2012 server that hosted kms but now its time as come and we need to shutdown that server. I done the server licenses and it worked like charm but now when trying to add new Office 2013 keys to new KMS server (OS2022) it says this
 An activation request has been processed.
 Info:
 0xC004F042
 ​
 i had some test pc-s to work with and tried with command -skms to manually add them and it did work and they get the right license but from server it still showing that error, anyone has a fix for that?

                              <span>time and again we receive concerned calls/emails from users who have received a suspicious email/link/file.
 Of course, we in IT say that this must not be opened under any circumstances!
 ​
 I am a sysadmin, not a security specialist. Nevertheless, I (and my colleagues) are curious about what would happen if a potential virus is executed or a link is followed.
 ​
 To test something like this, we currently have an old notebook with Windows 7. The notebook is of course not in the domain and in a separate VLAN without access to the LAN.
 We would like to replace this notebook with a new one (more performance, Win10 etc.).
 ​
 Now to my question: do you have a special computer to test potential viruses, malware, phishing links etc.?
 If so, what is your configuration of the computer?
 ​
 - separate VLAN -&gt; no access to the LAN
 - no domain join
 - Office installed
 - 7zip
 - Wireshark
 Have you created a way to reset the computer after running the file? Restore Point, Backup, Hyper-V or something else?
 ​
 The reason for this computer is primarily curiosity and to rule out any false positives.

                              <span>I will share my knowledge about this case. We are in investigation with the HP Support to solve this but maybe this helps also other people.
 We had this issue on HP Elitebook 845 G7 and Elitebook 855 G7 but i think Elitebook 835 G7 will have this issue too.
 Since the release of Windows 11 we are Testing this new OS version in our environment. A clean install is working great an all policies are prepared. But every upgrade attempt from Windows 10 to Windows 11 ended in a Bluescreen. (UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP)
 Because we had other project ongoing we have waited until Windows 11 22H2. Maybe the problem was solved in this release but we had the same issue. Both scenarios upgrade Windows 10 to Windows 11 22H2 and upgrade Windows 11 21H2 to 22H2.
 After this bad experience we created a case at the HP Support. After some troubleshooting and sending them our logs we have found the issue.
 It&#x27;s the Synaptics touchpad driver. 
 When we remove the driver the upgrade is working fine. Now we wait for a response from HP if they will release a fixed driver.
 I will update this post when i receive some new information.

                              <span>Hi, 
 we need a mail service like mailjet to do bulkmail.
 I would like to avoid using our primary domain for this, or set up a 2nd DKIM and SPF to coexist with our primary mail system, due to &quot;i have a bad feeling about this&quot;.
 I guess because i don&#x27;t want to jeopardize domain reputation, risk being blacklisted, or deal with the consequences of the mailservice being compromised. 
 Which is why i proposed to buy a new domain, with one or two mail accounts attached to it, for bulk mails only, without interfering with other productive mail services.
 A follow up question to this was:
 Would protective services like Microsofts Defender P1 or P2 (or other vendors) recognize those massmails as Phishing or Impersonation? Because there will be  links and images within the body that point towards our primary domain, while the sender address would be from the new domain.
 I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case, but since i&#x27;m stuck in the overthinking game now, i&#x27;m not so sure anymore. Anyone had to deal with this before?

 Hi, I&#x27;m relatively new to gpg4win, and am trying to accomplish what I *think* is a relatively simple task.
 I&#x27;d like to encrypt and decrypt files from a command line, such that I can script a process to automatically parse files in a folder to be encrypted at regular intervals, or decrypted. I have only one certificate with private key stored in Kleopatra, and it&#x27;s set to my default identity, and &quot;ultimate&quot; trusted.
 I&#x27;ve googled for hours, read through documentation, found examples, but a few of the option switches that are widely referenced don&#x27;t seem to work with gpg4win (IE, --passphrase-file or --passphrase_fl, or even just --passphrase).
 Here&#x27;s my current syntax for a test encryption
 .\gpg -r &quot;KEYNAME&quot; -o testencrypt.gpg --pinentry-mode&#x3D;loopback --passphrase &quot;PASSPHRASE&quot; --default-recipient-self --always-trust -encrypt test.txt
 yeilds :
 gpg: ypt: skipped: No public keygpg: test.txt: encryption failed: No public key
 I&#x27;m not sure if I even need the passphrase for encryption, rather than decryption - but if I omit --passphrase, it prompts for one.
 I haven&#x27;t gotten to decryption syntax, but figure it will be pretty much just the opposite process. I noticed the gpg-preset-passphrase.exe program, and ran it and entered the password there - not sure if that impacts anything.
 Thanks for any insight!
 edit : using gpg4win 4.0.3

 Unfortunately we cannot use OneDrive to redirect user directories and instead are looking to utilise the in-built user folder redirection GPO and wanted to check if anyone here may have used this in the past and can provide any advice or anecdotal tales?
 Our plan is...
  
Use GPO to redirect our user folders (Desktop, Documents etc) to a windows file share using the in-built offline files feature.
 The share will be hosted on DFS and replicated between fileservers across regions.
 Configure folder quotas to prevent users running riot with local files
  
Does this sound like a bad idea?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Dear fellow IT peeps, 
 First question was : https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/y06smj/sysadminsoftware_enginners_is_this_normal/?utm_source&#x3D;share&amp;utm_medium&#x3D;web2x&amp;context&#x3D;3
 I got another question, as i am wondering if this is a common practice which i have not experinced as i feel that it is a bad pratice, or am i wrong, 
 So for example, Customer creates a ticket, ticket gets assigned to wtv team i.e. Hardware team. Hardware team resolves the issues, comments on the ticket saying issue has been resolved, can we proceed to close the ticket, customer comments back about a quey on something that is not related the issue i.e. warranty status of the HD which we have to email the OEM and await their reply. Which will extend the SLA even though the main issue has been resolved. 
 Do you get the customer to create a new ticket or keep the ticket open?
 For me i think it is a bad practice to keep the ticket open, from my experience usually we&#x27;d get the customer to create a new ticket. 
 But then again, back then i was working for companies had some of control i.e. HPE, big IT corps. 
 But the new company i just joined, i am still getting used to the practice, and i was wondering if i should address this as this might give the customer too much power to dictate and of course my previous question
 I find such practices bad and is making things very confusing which in turn would reduce productivity.
 ​
 Am i wrong?
 Or should i address this? 
 I dont wanan address something that would shoot myself in the foot

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month&#x27;s updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft&#x27;s Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft&#x27;s updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn&#x27;t work.
 Test, test, and test!

                              <span>Helping my relatives setup their internet / networking where they will be leasing part of the food store to someone else for their deli. They would like to supply an ethernet wire to the deli so they can connect their switch and other wired devices (think POS / credit card terminal / PC) to said switch.
 From my short research, it seems like I would need a managed switch separating the two networks via VLAN. So basically, ISP Modem / Router &gt; Managed switch:
 &gt; Ports 1&amp;2 for the food store &gt; Add another switch (does it matter if its managed or unmanaged?) for the food store&#x27;s wired devices
 &gt; Ports 3&amp;4 for the Deli &gt; Add another switch (does it matter if its managed or unmanaged?) for the deli&#x27;s wired devices 
 Wifi SSID will not be broadcasted to limit wireless devices. 
 Am I even remotely on the right path to accomplish this? There is only one ISP available at this location and they can&#x27;t provide a separate service just for the deli.

 So I&#x27;m in charge of setting up the 802.1x for a new site we are moving to. I work for a company with around 200 sites around the country and a pretty big DC with ACI, ISE, SD-WAN etc.... all across these sites.
 The normal way of doing things like segregating users has been via VLANS and FW rules. However with this new site I&#x27;ve setup and tested an 802.1x config I&#x27;ve done with TEAP for Windows users, EAP-TLS for MAC&#x27;S and MAB for cameras etc... all working. My plan was to see what AD group the user coming into ISE was in and the delegate them a VLAN tag on ISE and pass it back to the Authenticator switch, it all works. But after speaking to my lead today, he suggested a couple of things or ways of going about doing user segregation at the new site.
 We have been talking about what is the best way to go about IP addressing schemes for users at the site, do we create seperate VLAN&#x27;s for infrastructure/networks, finance, HR etc.... with their own subnets or do we put them all into one big range (a big broadcast L2 domain I know, but kit these days can handle it to be honest) and then look to use SGT&#x27;s on ISE and assign them segregation based off them that way.
 Any opinions or other suggestions would be welcome.
 Thanks everyone

                              <span>Hi, we are having an issue when some of our spoke sites that have 2x MPLS circuts (no broadband etc...) and one circut is a higher bandwidth than the other in all of them, I never set the solution up but it is live in production now and if the primary link fails, then it takes a good few mins to switch over to the second lower bandwidth link. There are 2 static routes going out both links (same administrative distance) but the second lower bandwidth link has been set to the &quot;last resort circuit&quot; command and the primary higher bandwidth link is the only link/interface that appears in the routing table.
 In comparison, the same setup is also on sites that have the same bandwidth across both links, if the primary circuit fails then it is a seamless transition to the second circuit and both static routes are in the routing table to.
 Anyone any advice on where/what I could look to change in order to make this work better and for the second link at the sites with unequal bandwidth links, to be able to seamlessly switch over to the second link?
 Cheers

                              <span>I think they are, but I&#x27;m not a cable tech. I was working with a cabling guy today who said, &quot;Nobody runs multimode anymore.&quot; Is that true? I&#x27;m just learing about actual projects, pricing, so Im not very familiar with whats normal and what isn&#x27;t. 
 We are working on a project where a run from the network room will lead outside, underground through a conduit, and then to an outdoor area. This is about 300ft. Then there will be a run from that outdoor area to another outdoor area roughly 300ft out. To me, that is something multimode fiber can easily handle, but I&#x27;d like to hear what others have experience with. I know the cost will be higher for transceivers, but this is for a third party client. Im not trying to nickel or dime or mess with a sale for a cable company, but I also want to learn.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve taken over responsibility for an Aruba 6000 48G R8N86A switch that in another state and I cannot get signed in. I have an old config file showing the local accounts with ciphertext passwords, as well as the radius config with ciphertext of the pre-shared key.
 Access-Requests hit the radius server (Windows server NPS) and are rejected with &quot;Authentication failed due to a user credentials mismatch. Either the user name provided does not map to an existing user account or the password was incorrect.&quot;
 I am using known good credentials.
 If I change the PSK in NPS, I continue to get the same error message so I suspect NPS client config might have the wrong PSK.
 Question 1. Is there a way to reverse the cipher text on the PSK?
 I attempted to set up new connection request policy in NPS, and under SETTINGS-&gt;AUTHENTICATION I checked the box for &quot;Accept users without validating credentials&quot; and then I see Access-Accept sent back to the switch, but the switch still rejects with &quot;Access Denied&quot;.
 Question 2. Does this not work how I think it would? Any other way to force a successful authentication in NPS to get logged in?
 I also blocked radius traffic from switch-&gt;Radius server to get it to time out and attempt local creds. No documented creds will work.
 Question 3. Similar to Q1. Is there a way to recover local password from the ciphertext?
 There is no remote support at this location. I&#x27;ll have to drive 6 hours to reset it if needed... Lol

                              <span>What&#x27;s the best practice for linking multiple switches to our firewall appliance? As a network novice, I&#x27;ve been running the uplink line from the FW into switch 1, then another line from SW1 into SW2, then another line from SW2 to SW3, so on and so forth. I know this is not a best practice as if one of the switches goes out then the rest go with it. So what would be the be practice here? I&#x27;m using a mix of switches currently, but most of them are Dell 15 series.
 Thanks.

Network design isn&#x27;t my area of expertise and I&#x27;m getting a little overwhelmed with the options available - I had some general best practices questions and requests for model recommendations.
 We&#x27;re a small business with around ~150 users with primarily hybrid in-office/remote workforce. Multiple IT staff (mostly developers) but I&#x27;m the one probably best suited for this project.
 Currently an old Cisco SG-500 stack performs all internal layer 3 and layer 2 requirements, core, distribution, access, the works. Workstations and servers are segmented on separate VLANs.
 Initially the network was flat and my goal was to separate and shape traffic between workstations/servers with ACLs on the SG-500 stack. It &quot;works&quot; but I…</span>

                              <span>We have an appliance calling home to report input errors.
 When rounded to the nearest thousandth, most input errors are 0.002%. I read a Net craftsmen post saying that anything above 0.001% should be investigated.
 In most cases, the switch is reporting a 0.000% output error rate.
 In some cases, both the switch and the node show an error rate. Examples below.
 Most of the connections are to the same switch; I&#x27;m not sure this matters.
  
​
  
 Node Node input error rate Switch output error rate 
  
 1 0.002% 0.000% 
  2 0.002% 0.009% 
 
 ​
  
Do you agree with that threshold for error rate troubleshooting?
 If yes, would you clean only the SFP/Fiber on the node side if the node is showing errors but the switch is not?

                              <span>I&#x27;m inheriting a job supporting a SATCOM hub network at a teleport. It&#x27;s a small-ish site that provides Internet or managed network access to a few hundred remote SATCOM terminals via a small number of high bandwidth uplinks. My background is in radio networking (MANET, microwave, trunked voice &amp; data, etc) but I&#x27;m fairly competent with Cisco R&amp;S gear.
 This site has been badly neglected and is in acute need of a tech refresh. It currently has about 12-14 access switches and six routers that manage IP traffic between the modems and other infrastructure, and an old ASA that connects to the Internet and provides remote access via AnyConnect. I plan to replace the switches and routers pretty quickly, and the firewall soon after.
 I&#x27;m going to write a preliminary proposal to outline the tech refresh project and justify funding for subsequent trade studies and eventual capital purchase.
 Now for my question: I&#x27;m a little turned off by Cisco&#x27;s extremely high prices, the complexity of their feature licensing, and also their super long lead times right now. I have positive impressions towards Juniper and Extreme gear, though my experience with them is limited. Given the relative simplicity of this network, I&#x27;ve wondered if I could get by using Ubiquiti or Mikrotik, but ultimately I think we&#x27;ll want a paid support option. Assuming a homogeneous environment meaningfully reduces complexity and risk, is there a single brand that might be best suited for this application?

                              <span>I design IOT devices and a feature I’m adding allows my devices to identify one another on a network. The goal is for each device to be able to scan the subnet and find one another so they can show users “devices found on your network” rather than requiring them to type in each IP/host name. I’ll allow typing in for cross-VLAN or other setups, but would like to suggest them units where possible to make it easier. 
 What is the best way to do this? I see this with things like my tplink controller where it can find my access points on the network and suggest them to me. Is this just brute force pinging each IP in the subnet at a specific endpoint and looking for a certain response?
 Not looking for a full on explanation, just need a term or concept to be able to research more into. And looking for suggestions as I’m sure there are many ways to do this. Thanks!

                              <span>Short version: What is the best way to do a local domain mesh that supports local broadcast protocols, as well as some L2 jiggery pokery on an airgapped network?
 Long version:
 Large scale professional audio/video/lighting networks currently all setup as airgapped switched only networks with a lot of protocols relying on local broadcast for discovery and function. As these networks get bigger we run in to topology problems trying to maintain HA/resiliency/redundancy.
 It gets very awkward when your network is down, the show is stopped and you have a live audience of 20000 people and millions watching on television.
 Most networks end up as a ring (with RSTP or EAPS), or as one long daisy-chain (broken ring). Some folks will run parallel links (that are unconnected until one fails and then the spare gets manually plugged in)
 It looks like TRILL would have been a solution, but it seems that it really never took off, so I am looking at routing solutions.
 Requirements: fast convergence times, once routers are configured the first time: plug and play operation in the field, loop/feedback protection, mesh ability, and the endpoints see all local broadcast traffic.
 From what I gather OSPF/EVPN/VXLAN might be the solution?!? Any other ideas, links or info on configuring those together? Pitfalls?
 For reference, some lighting networks:

                              <span>We put in ACI in 2019 thinking we&#x27;d eventually split out Dev and Stage into separate VRFs and eventually go multisite or some of all the promise ACI has. We had a leadership change and he pointed to the sky aka cloud. So that&#x27;s where we are, multicloud whether we were planning it or not. It&#x27;s in better shape than that sounds. 
 It&#x27;s renewal time and we just don&#x27;t need the complexity or cost of ACI. Knowing the switches (some of em) also support NX-OS mode and with the reduction in footprint we&#x27;ve had since the cloud migration I&#x27;m thinking we can migrate out of ACI by shuffling some links around, Converting some stuff to NX-OS mode and shuffling back. I don&#x27;t have a fully fleshed out plan but has anyone else done it? You know how it is, if you&#x27;re doing something you&#x27;re probably not the first.
 Edit: I know it’s easy to switch between modes. That’s not really what I’m talking about. Asking if anyone has done it and more importantly did you hit your head on the way out? Crazy gotchas etc.

I believe I have my SNMPv3 working on my Adtran 1550 switch because my NSM (Auvik) says that it is able to authenticate and gives me alerts when devices are down/shows device bandwidth/etc. However, my switches are continually saying &quot;SNMP_SOURCE Authentication Failure&quot; in their logs. I am curious if this means it is not functioning properly. Right now, I only have one SNMPv3 NSM credential for all my switches. 
 Any assistance would be helpful. Is this just normal? Should I narrow down the OID? Thank you.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I currently have a pair of fairly critical ASR1002-X routers in our DC that haven&#x27;t been upgraded/rebooted in about three years. They&#x27;re both on asr1002x-universalk9.16.09.05.SPA.bin currently, running in bundle mode and need to be upgraded to asr1002x-universalk9.17.03.05.SPA.bin (will also require a ROMMON upgrade to asr1000-rommon.173-1r.SPA.pkg).
 Can anyone that&#x27;s done a similar upgrade path (16.X.X to 17.X.X) guide me towards any pitfalls/recommendations for the upgrade procedure? Pretty much every upgrade documentation I&#x27;ve found talks about install mode being the best option, should I convert these or does it really matter? 
 Also with the ROMMON upgrade, can that be done in one go alongside the IOS before a reboot or does it require multiple reboots (ROMMON upgrade &gt; reboot &gt; IOS upgrade &gt; reboot)?
 Thanks for the assistance!

 To give an example of where I&#x27;m coming from: I&#x27;m working on setting up automated testing at my workplace. We&#x27;re an international L2 connectivity provider and so one of the big products we have are pseudowires between locations. We have automation to deploy services when a customer orders them, but I&#x27;m working on trying to setup automation to test different product configurations and combinations before we roll them out to customers. 
 Trying to cover all possible permutations of configuration is a monumental task and cardinality quickly becomes an issue. For example, say I have 1 physical topology with 2 CE devices connected to 2 PE devices, connected to the other side across …</span>

 I am again in the position to generate another 1000 free places on my Udemy JNCIA course, I have been asked why I am offering it free to Reddit / LinkedIn ect and its because if I can give away the course that will benefit others.
 Some instructors just post their courses on giveaway sites and end up getting enrolments that are never used, I want to offer it to people that might at some point have a look and maybe find it useful.
 As a new instructor myself I have found the feedback to be most helpful and once my other courses are completed, they will be offered free to.
 Any feedback is welcome.
 The below code is valid for 5 days however once signed up you have the course for life.
 I thank you in advance and good luck in your studies.

                              <span>Hey guys, we have had a couple of discussions at work about the concepts behind &quot;switchport mode trunk&quot; / &quot;switchport trunk allowed vlan all&quot;. The two commands both accept every VLAN configured on the switch on the trunk ports. So my question is, if there are any disadvantages for network, when the trunks are configured in that way instead of specifying the exact VLANs. We have some delays and higher TTLs in our network and/or some black magic we can&#x27;t figure out. So my boss hat the opinion its caused by the trunk all command. Is that true? We are talking about a VLAN configuration of 20-30 VLANs.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey all!
 Just trying to get a client up with Starlink - we are using tunnels to deliver their public IP and starlink as a backhaul - this all works fine.
 Deployment testing internally - we just setup a dhcp server and added routes based on DHCP like so:
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 dhcp 100
 And a few other routes back to management IP&#x27;s in case of tunnel issues
 ip route 1.2.3.4 255.255.255.255 dhcp 100
 This worked in testing with normal DHCP server, but what we&#x27;ve found since deploying is that starlink&#x27;s IPoE doesn&#x27;t deliver a default route via the &#x27;dhcp&#x27; keyword - i.e. DHCP Option 3 (I believe) and is instead providing the default static route via classless routes (option 121) ?
 The big tell is that a default route is there, but its 254 distance instead of the configured 100, and the /32 routes we added do not get picked up.
 So my question is thus - given we can not get that gateway using the &#x27;dhcp&#x27; keyword on the routes, is there any way to kind of add a route for the /32&#x27;s based on the default route given out in what we assume is option 121?
 I am remote to the site, so can&#x27;t really reliably debug DHCP without kicking my access off, so any help is appreciated to understand my options.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi All, I&#x27;m not sure if my vocabulary is sound on this question. I hope you can decipher it. 
 I have a data network that is roughly 75 drops. The installer mixed the runs for voice and data. So each cable is terminated into two jacks, 2 pair for data, 2 pair for voice. Nothing is labeled, and my toner does not seem to work with these mixed cable runs. The toner tests out fine on a standard patch cable.
 Do I need a different\better toner or is this expected on cables terminated this way?

                              <span>New Network Engineer here who joined a new company. I have the opportunity to get some Juniper switches that will accomplish the exact same thing as some Catalyst 9300&#x27;s (can&#x27;t get these for a year) but the existing Network Engineers are looking at me as though I&#x27;m a heretic :)
 Is there something glaring about Juniper that I&#x27;m missing? On paper Junos seems to tick the right boxes of not being a monolithic kernel, linux-based, EVPN/VXLAN support, SDN management and they&#x27;ve been around for decades. I&#x27;m getting my talking points together to talk with management about it, but I &quot;don&#x27;t know what I don&#x27;t know&quot; so I&#x27;m hoping reddit can educate me as to if there is something in production with this gear&#x27;s operation that someone with tribal knowledge would know. Could definitely use some career advice as, the only downside I see is having to learn something new but I could be way off base. Thanks.

 I have been able to identify the firewall (HA-FP asa) interface as the kick off of all these occurrences. This device sits on a TOR running RSTP. This is currently configured as an access port. The TOR connects via vPC to two 9500 chassis with the primary acting as STP root. (No peer switch configuration) these are set by separate priority levels. Priority 1 &amp; 4096.
 Under the core we have two more vPC domains running RSTP. The vlan 1 root ports are reflecting correct…</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 Having a bit of a problem driving me nuts and hoping someone can lend a bone.
 I&#x27;ve done a similiar setup before and never had any trouble.
 I have two physical sites with an ESX host in each. All networking machines are inside of ESX. There is a virtual firewall at each site. The two have a Site2Site VTI (Route based) VPN Tunnel between them. Over it I&#x27;m sending VXLan traffic. The VxLan endpoint is behind each of the firewalls, running OpnSense in another VM. No NAT going on inside the VTI. Subnet to subnet. VxLan link is established and I have a stretched layer 2 segment with the IP range of 10.20.171.0/24. I can ping across it. I can browse http across it. But the second I swap the same test/set of ips for https - I&#x27;m unable to browse. In other words, I believed that it is a TLS problem. curl -k -vvv showed it hanging on &quot;Client Hello&quot;.
 ​
 Using the same http host I succeeded with but https did not work with, I did a client side wireshark twice:
  
On Net
 Across VxLink
  
For #1, it worked (ie: the vms live next to each other on the same time).
 For #2, last thing client sends is a tls &quot;client hello&quot; and never receives the server hello back.
 I did another wire shark on the server side, and the server hello IS being sent back, just not arriving at back at the client. OVER THE SAME LINK that plain old http (stateful) and icmp work.
 I&#x27;m absolutely dizzy trying to chase the packets for that particular conversation at this stage. 
 Can anyone think of anything?

                              <span>Background: We&#x27;re currently investigating options for microsegmentation using NSX. This is a brownfield deployment, so we have lots of workloads that are already talking to each other and we need to do some kind of discovery to determine what&#x27;s talking to what on what ports.
 VMware&#x27;s solution is to pay a lot of money for vRealize Network Insight. I&#x27;m balking partly on the cost and partly on the principle of the thing.... lots of firewall products have this visibility for no extra cost once you buy the product.
 Anyone have suggestions for alternative approaches?

 Looking at the documentation online it looks like only the following platforms support ERSPAN.
  
Cisco 6500
 Nexus switches
 Cisco ISR 44xx
 Cisco ASR
 Cisco 3850 ( IOS-XE 16.x)
  
Does RSPAN have more support and can you pretty much RSPAN on any switch? Dell, Cisco, etc?

                              <span>We have some relatively old Nexus 5k’s where I work. They are vPC’d together and support fex’s throughout the campus with workstations on them. 
 We’re having an issue where some of the new workstations getting connected to the fex’s, their MAC address shows up in the table as a static mac being learned over the vPC peer link. It’s the same on both Nexuses, they both think they’re learning it from the other device. We can’t clear it out of the mac table because it’s a static (it will only let you clear dynamic), and when checking the running config on both devices there are no static MAC’s assigned to any interfaces. 
 Has anyone seen this issue before, or found a resolution? 
 TLDR: both our nexuses think they’re learning a static mac from the other side via the vPC peer link, but there is no static mac configured.

                              <span>We are moving offices to a building about 200m down the street for... various reasons (dont ask). We currently have WAN links (fiber LES) to the building but the connection is sometimes problematic, and only 1gbit when its working at its best. We are going to be moving our entire office to the building so to ease this transition we want to link back to the original office with the fastest link we can reasonably set up without spending mad amounts of cash.
 We have looked at possibly using the Unifi UBB-XG https://dl.ui.com/ds/ubb-xg_ds.pdf But its not clear if this is encrypted and/or secure. Regular raw wifi isnt an option in our setup, and laying a VPN over the top means a lot of reconfiguration of routing etc. Ideally we want to extend our broadcast domain over the wifi (not ideal but its only short term) to avoid having to reconfigure all the equipment. Also the speed appears to only be ~6gbit on a good day, despite it having 10gbit SPF+ ports.
 Can anyone suggest a better option? Preferably someone with some experiential knowledge.

                              <span>Hi guys. I’m having kind of a dilemma here. We are trying to achieve network segmentation with port security at our work but there is something I just can’t seem to grasp on how to fix.
 We want to use 802.1x on all access switch ports, the problem is that we use different vlans for difference devices. So printers in VLAN20, clients in VLAN10 etcetera. I want to somehow push the VLAN through authorization policies so that users can move printers without having them stop functioning.
 I want to know what we can do about this in an event where the ISE goes down completely. I know that you can revert to a specified VLAN if the radius server goes dead. But I want that for every VLAN we use. 
 Is that even possible?

                              <span>Hello,
 We&#x27;re considering to buy few new DC Internet Edge routers, we need them just for routing, no need MPLS or segment routing, or other &#x27;fancy&#x27; features, currently we&#x27;re using Cisco NCS-5501-SE. But it has only 4x100G ports, which is not sufficient. So we started to look to other options:
 Cisco NCS55A1-24H - it has 24x100G, but limited scale - supports only ~2.2millions of prefixes. The maximum could be reached in a few next years. So this is not very good. Filter all /24 prefixes would be a workaround for future, but it could bring some new un expected problems, so we&#x27;re looking very carefully to this.
 Cisco NCS 55A1-36H-SE-S - It has 36x100G with Extended scale for prefixes - support 4millions of prefixes, but seems too expensive.
 Maybe you know so other models would be not so expensive as NCS 55A1-36H-SE-S ? Maybe something from Juniper series ? I think every DC operator with quite much internet traffic are having similar head ache these days. Any advices ? Thanks !

 Quick question. I&#x27;m setting up some performance SLA&#x27;s for our SDWAN based internet circuits. What sites do y&#x27;all generally use for the SLA servers? 
 I usually use Google&#x27;s 8.8.8.8 and OpenDNS 208.67.222.222
 Thoughts? Suggestions?
 My firewall SLA&#x27;s use Packet Loss, Latency and Jitter to determine best connection.
 Thanks all,

                              <span>Testing an FPR-1010 with FMCv and would like come clarification on the access control policy.
 Normally a firewall with stateful inspection allows outbound traffic to return unless explicitly denied.
 I have a policy configured with the following rules:
 Mandatory
  
Log all connections - Monitor only
 Allow specific applications
 Block &#x27;very high risk&#x27; applications.
 Geoblocking rule
  
Default
  
Allow traffic inside zone to outside zone and inspect.
  
Default Action: Access Control: Block all traffic.
 However, most return traffic is still being blocked on the outside ingress.
 What is the proper way to configure such a policy for a perimeter FPR?

                              <span>Hey im a sysadmin with little experience of networking, but its unfortunately part of my job at the moment.
 We are building a collapsed core topology with our 4 sites (30m apart from eachother)
 The site in the middle has two HA firewalls and each site will have a ring design in the access layer. Each site will also have a l3 switch for inter-vlan routing, connected to the firewall in the middle.
 I am wondering if the l3 switches are even needed since the routing between vlans could be accomplished directly via the firewalls?

Or to be more clear, block all websites except a few? For example, I want to get access to: Google, Reddit, Amazon and YouTube, but all others will be blocked? What solutions exist?
 When I was young, I remember when some sites in my school were always blocked, for example social medias. What can I do, if I want to block ALL sites except only a few?

 It is just the phones which use the MDM to pull policy and such, any point running on signatures on it? 
 We use F5 ASM WAF to be specific!
 At this rate my next post would be - Is anyone connecting the metal detector to the WAF?

 ​
 https://fkeep.io/imgs/i/ptbR.jpg
 ​
 Basically, I want the vouchers to be usable up to X HOURS based on actual use and not when the voucher was activated (which forces the user to use it up all the moment it&#x27;s activated).
 Say user one is issued an 8 hour voucher
 User can use it for a total of 8 hours worth meaning that the user can disconnect from portal when he&#x27;s done browsing online for the moment, in order to have more time to browser online later.
 In the future, I would also need to generate some vouchers that will expire based on when it was first activated (used).
 But basically, I can&#x27;t tell which is which.

 I have two routers: one for internet access, and other other is an LTE router for accessing a specialized service.
 There is no LAN infrastructure so am thinking of bridging the two wifis into one by making one behave like a switch.
 or turn one into a switch and connect it to the second router via lan cable. (with the process, i think i wont be able to access the services of both routers.
 Or i can get a third old router, turn it into a switch and connect the two routers to it. AM not sure if the 3rd rout/switch would be able to broadcast a wifi with the two wifis merged.
 Is it possible to do so or to do routing in a router/switch?
 ​
 its a thought experiment. Glad for any suggestions

                              <span>Hi Friends, 
 Can you please help clarify following doubts?
  
In OSPF, While forwarding a received Type5 LSA to other area, why does the ABR not change the Advertising Router IP of the Type 5 LSA to it&#x27;s own IP? What is te basic reason behind this? If ABR is able to change the Advertising Router&#x27;s IP in the Type5 LSA, then there was no need of Type 4 LSA which meant less OSPF overhead on the network.
 BGP Split Horizon Rule says, &quot;Don&#x27;t advertise IBGP learned routes to another IBGP peer.&quot; The purpose is to avoide loop because as per standard, it is assumed that all of the IBGP Peers will be on full mesh connectivity. - What is the reason that the BGP Protocol designers made this standard assumption?
 Why is does the Route Reflector not change the next hop IP while advertising an IBGP learned route to client? I am trying to understand what made the BGP designers decide for RR to not change the next Hop IP for IBGP learned routes?
 What is the reason due to which BGP designers did not consider EBGP router to automatically change Next Hop IP for EBGP learned routes while advertising towards IBGP Peers?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve got a few logical networks at the office. Internal LAN/Ethernet, Phones/VOIP, Internal Wifi, Guest Wifi, pretty basic). For the network equipment I have a firewall/router appliance, two managed switches, and three wireless access points. 
 Should I have one interface port on the Firewall appliance configured as a trunk for each of the logical networks setup as VLANs? Or would splitting wired and wireless device types into their own switches, each connected to a dedicated interface on the appliance be the better choice?
 What are the pros &amp; cons, and which would give me better or worse performance? Is either approach sound?

                              <span>Hello, I just recently acquired a quarter rack with one 10G uplink and two bgp sessions. I&#x27;m trying to figure out how I&#x27;m going to deploy the network. I have some ideas but am running into some analysis paralysis.
 I have some questions I want to ask. The hosts are going to have 2x1G and 2x10G nics with the 10G being used for storage. 
 I&#x27;m trying to figure out what TOR switch I should use. I&#x27;m also trying to figure out if I should do all the routing on the TOR switch and even do the bgp sessions on said switch or should I just trunk the uplink to its own router and a firewall behind it. I have a xeon d host where I was planning on virtualizing most network functions.
 I&#x27;m probably not going to be able to afford any brand new high end switch so used switch recommendations are highly welcome.

                              <span>We use an MSP, but have been slowly looking to leave them. 
 Today, something odd happened. We noticed that old users account that were once deleted now appeared back in AD. To add to this, a bunch of users that were removed from security groups for licensing purposes, were also suddenly added back to those sec groups. The MSP had dropped the ball on doing back ups for the last few months and we noticed a couple weeks ago and they have been working to get their crap together. So they have been in and out of the network working on this. 
 I’m not entirely sure what happened and why Active Directory suddenly looks like old stuff is there and/or reverted in some way or idk, cause it’s not reverted in its entirety. 
 What are some events or things I can look at in AD to help determined what happened here???

                              <span>Hi ladies and gents,
 ​
 Would really appreciate some help with AD delegation please?
 ​
 with a delegated user,
 I&#x27;m having a problem where, if I keep a users password as is, (for test purposes) and untick the box that says user must change password at next logon, the password is changed successfully.
 But if I access the account tab in ADUC, I still see the &quot;user must change password at logon&quot; box is ticked.
 If I untick and ok, I get that access is denied.
 ​
 what I&#x27;ve done thus far,
 I&#x27;ve created an OU, put some users in it and created a group to whom I&#x27;d like to delegate the permissions of change, reset password, read and write lockout time, read-write pwd last reset
 I&#x27;ve also added read and write user account control, but I&#x27;m not having any luck.
 ​
 Your help would be much appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;ll call this more of a sighing vent rather than a full rant. I&#x27;m waiting, and waiting and waiting for a customer machine that clearly hasn&#x27;t rebooted in ages to apply updates on shutdown.
 Next time I&#x27;ll encourage a customer power cycle before our maintenance window begins. We do have larger customers with scheduled reboots and monitoring via zabbix if it&#x27;s been too long with reboots queued but this is a smaller division.
 Just a quick sanity check, I have vm console access, I couldn&#x27;t have chosen &#x27;shutdown without updates&#x27; without credentials, correct?
 My other choice would have been to have them shut it down from inside OS, and patch when it came up instead.
 ​
 edit: the therapeutic power of bitching and moaning made the box relinquish it&#x27;s hold on my time. 2.2TB to migrate and hopefully up by start of business.

                              <span>I have a vendor who is sending emails our of their system and is getting flagged for DMARC quarantine. When working with the vendor, their recommendation is to turn this off or make our customers who are receiving these emails whitelist the vendors domain. For 7000 different customers this seems pretty unreasonable. I have been asked to give our management options on what to do. Here is what I have so far. 
 1) move systems to a different account receivable software that will sending information 
 2) email all customers to whitelist the domain
 3) turn off DMARC quarantine option. 
 ​
 Personally I don&#x27;t think 3 is an option but my direct manager wanted it there. I am leaning strongly towards 1 if the vendor cannot find a way to sending this in a secure fashion. Any helpful tips?

 We recently purchased some new server hardware with a lot of excess capacity and it&#x27;s painful to pay for DataCenter licenses for all of the cores when they&#x27;re not being used. My hope was that if I could license per VM cores, it might end up being cheaper than licensing per Hardware-cores.
 I&#x27;m trying to figure out some ballpark pricing but can&#x27;t find any details anywhere. Has anyone done this and would be willing to share?

 This isn&#x27;t anything special, this is my third phone system cutover in 9 years here. We went on-Prem Intertel to ShoreTelSky to a on-prem Mitel 3300/MiCollab system, and now we&#x27;re switching to Zoom Phone. And we&#x27;re only 115 or so extensions, most DID&#x27;s with just a few AA&#x27;s and groups. 
 My biggest issue. Comcast. We moved all 200+ of our DID&#x27;s to Comcast and used Comcast SIP (Via Fiber) for our OnPrem Mitel system. Getting them off Comcast has been a GIANT PITA. We&#x27;re forced to use Comcast for fiber services more or less, but for the love of god and all that is holy never put your phone system eggs in their basket if you even plan on moving from them. 
 We have had open port requests with them for over 4 months. 4 MONTHS We we…</span>

 Exchange Online Basic Auth Deprecation in Progress EX444315, Last updated: October 9, 2022 9:59 AM Estimated start time: October 8, 2022 5:00 PM
 We&#x27;ve had a number of users that SHOULD default to modern auth but that doesn&#x27;t always seem to be the case. We&#x27;re currently working on forcing to modern auth via GP.
 Happy Canadian Thanksgiving! ...grumble...grumble...

                              <span>I just had this discussion and it reminded me that I wanted to raise this point here.
 My current team lead gifted me with this concept - the turd system. A &#x27;turd&#x27; is a task that shouldn&#x27;t exist, doesn&#x27;t make sense to exist in its current form, and is a pain in the ass to handle, especially in bulk. Turds tends to naturally accumulate into heaps of shit, until either some poor responsible souls goes shovel them, or they get stomped down the drain.
 My team lead is of the firm beliefs that it&#x27;s a good thing for turds to accumulate, as this triggers the &#x27;turd system&#x27; - someone eventually complains that the turds aren&#x27;t being passed in a timely fashion, and after a few iterations this provides the impetus to restructure or remove the task so as to eliminate the source of turds.
 This strikes me as something that is typical of organizations in general. Dumb shit creates work no one wants to do it, least of all the people who realize it&#x27;s pointless. If someone handles it, that process never gets reviewed. However, if it&#x27;s left to break, then eventually decision-makers will resign themselves to changing the process.
 Does your shop have a turd system too?

                              <span>Hi,
 Dell have released a new firmware (1.40.20 → 2.0.0) for their PowerEdge MX7000 enclosure, has anyone tried it?
 Release notes: https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-uk/openmanage-enterprise-modular/omem_2.00.00_rn/openmanage-enterprise-modular-2.00.00?guid&#x3D;guid-6d5d53e7-0c4a-4ae2-8e15-b49e146be3a9&amp;lang&#x3D;en-us&amp;lwp&#x3D;rt
 We only have one enclosure so any feedback is welcomed.

 I&#x27;m looking to setup an high availability file server cluster and I am not sure if the built-in failover cluster functionality in Windows is the best solution to achieve this.
 Do you have some experience or advice to share ? I&#x27;m looking into any solutions free or paid.
 Thanks.

 I have 15 vms and 15 active remote users I need to support with 1 machine(this) and 1 pure backup. WIll dual x269x work for that? I&#x27;m looking at 2697a v4 or 2695 v4. Id like 2698 v4 but haven&#x27;t found it.
 What are the actual power savings from going up a generation but only by 1 year. Is the 62xx very different than 61xx? Ive read the gen10 ILO is much better. My IT will all be remote, will that make a difference? WIll they be able to use gen9 remotely without a problem?

                              <span>We are a small msp and we normally purchase equipment (Mostly HP servers, PCs, laptops, routers, firewalls) for our clients from Tech Data if possible. We have been displeased with Tech Data for the last 12 months or so, bad customer support, low or inaccurate inventory numbers, slow shipping, etc. Wondering what other vendors y’all use? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi guys, so, I&#x27;m pretty new SysAdmin, I&#x27;m 18yo and currently on my 6 month being a SysAdmin, so don&#x27;t be surprised that I&#x27;m really dumb. In my Company we&#x27;re having issues with Outlook 2013 asking passwords and no one being able to log in, I searched about it and found It things related to basic and modern authentication, It was enabled and yet It didn&#x27;t work, when I disabled It some users began to be able to access again but others not, when I enable It again everyone went down. I think it&#x27;s better that I disable It for everyone and fix everyone that can&#x27;t log in yet, so I&#x27;ll have the next 3 months to think about a solution and re-enable before Jan 2023 Can you guys help me here? Extra info: OS-W7, Office 2013, I already tried to disable and re-enable modern auth, create/change the 3 Registry keys that Microsoft said that were needed in order to modern auth work, delete credencials from windows control panel, change passwords.

                              <span>Hi. 
 At work I have a folder containing a indext.html that links to maps and folders with building maps, and maps of patch panel ect. Also pictures of them.
 It works, but has some limitations because if the building changes I must draw all lines again if I want to update it. 
 I am looking for a system of some kind (or html tag) so I can have this map as background and write on top of it as a layer two.
 This might not be very good explained, but I hope it is understandable.

 What is the fastest way to install those images onto a few devices that are high priority? Is there any way to perform that action off of a USB HD without a WDS/MDT server?

 Is there a way to prompt for a AzureAD admin account instead?
 Our devices are part of a workgroup opposed to a domain as we&#x27;re cloud based.

                              <span>First time configuring MFA on an AzureAD tenant. I&#x27;m having two issues currently.
  
AzureAD &gt; Security &gt; Identity Protection &gt; Multifactor Authentication Registration policy
  
This is not configurable, all of the options are grayed out (I&#x27;m signed in with a Global admin account). Not sure why I can&#x27;t edit anything, the default policy does not let me change the assigned users/groups, all grayed out.
 
 
Using a conditional access policy seems to work, forced my account to sign out and register a phone number (also had phone call and the app as options).
  
When I go into the test user&#x27;s Azure Profile &gt; Authentication Methods, it&#x27;s empty. When I worked a support role, I&#x27;d see the registered phone number there which could be cleared, or changed. Has this been moved? The &quot;new&quot; menu (blue ribbon at the top stating the &quot;new authentication experience) doesn&#x27;t have anything either
 
I also can&#x27;t seem to specify methods, I&#x27;d like to remove phone call as an option, and possibly remove text as well to force the authenticator app, as I&#x27;ve come to understand text is rather not secure, and the authenticator app seems to be generally regarded as a good method. Would this be done through the menu I mentioned in the first issue, the registration policy?

                              <span>External email tagging has been available in OWA, Outlook mobile, and Outlook for Mac since 2021. The most awaited support for &quot;Outlook for Windows&quot; is available now.
 In phishing attacks, attackers send emails pretending to be trusted persons or organizations. To prevent users from clicking malicious links and attachments sent by external users, admins can enable an external email warning tag in Outlook. It helps Outlook users handle those emails with extra attention. 
 Now admins can switch from the transport rule as it has few disadvantages,
  
It takes up a lot of space in the subject line, making it hard to preview the subject.
 As the transport rule might not be aware of the end user’s language, it leads to localization issues.
 Multiple external tags: If the external users keep replying to the thread, it will add multiple [External] tags in the subject.
 When you reply to the external email, they won&#x27;t get any clue that you have enabled external tagging.
  
Admins can enable it through PowerShell. Start enabling external email tagging to alert users, irrespective of device usage.

                              <span>I work for an MSP, and one of the banes of the job is setting up and configuring user profiles for our various clients. Some are basic, others demand all sorts of customizations and invariably the busy helpdesk staff miss out a step or two. Wondered if you use any sort of software, or have and suggestions to make this process easier to manage and more consistent?

                              <span>Few days ago, we discussed the newly-released grant control that helps us to apply phishing-resistant MFA.
 https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/xxy1hl/apply_this_new_phishingresistant_mfa_setting_to/
 Today I observed that we can also add a custom authentication type by combining any type of multi-factor authentication.
 By default, Microsoft has categorized three authentication modes under grant control. They are, 
  
Basic multi-factor authentication. 
 Passwordless multi-factor authentication. 
 Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication. 
  
Now the cherry on top of this, we can also create a custom authentication type based on your requirement. You can combine any type of multi-factor authentication of your wish and apply it to your users. It can significantly help in disabling weaker authentication methods, such as SMS and calls.
 How do you think this custom authentication type can be used for your organization?

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 I am hoping someone has experienced this issue or can point me in the correct direction.
 ​
 My Question:
 ​
 Each company has it own AD environment and I can&#x27;t (yet) fully merge them for various non-technical reasons
 ​
 We have two domains: CompanyA.local and CompanyB.local
 ​
 We have also a file server companyA.local
 ​
 The users from the domain CompanyB.local want to access the shared folders.
 ​
 ​
 also , how about file server permission procedure?
 ​
 This environment has two domains involved in a trust relationship. So both sides can authenticate to the other.
 ​
 ​
 ​
 Thank for your help!

                              <span>Hello,
 I like to use windows terminal, and I like it to default to wsl when opening. 
 But I&#x27;m using winget more and more, and so I also would like to have a different shortcut that will open windows terminal directly in power shell. To achieve so I&#x27;ve created a shortcut with parameters like so:
 &quot;C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_1.15.2524.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\wt.exe&quot; -p &quot;Windows PowerShell&quot; 
 As you can see the path to windows terminal executable will change at every new update, breaking my shortcut. Taking the time to fix the shortcut every time is not worth the hassle.
 Do anyone knows how to create a dynamic shortcut that will handle the continuous change in the path? I was thinking something like this:
 &quot;C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_*\wt.exe&quot; -p &quot;Windows PowerShell&quot; 
 But of course it will not work

 First of all, I apologises if this is not the correct subreddit to ask this question. If this is the case, feel free to remove this post.
 My situation:
 The service desk I work for is responsible for 12.000-15.000 users.
 The issues we need to resolve range from simple password resets to figuring out why a user&#x27;s account keeps getting locked out (most often it&#x27;s because they have older credentials on their phone).
 We are also responsible for reinstalling software using SCCM if it is packaged or from the vendor&#x27;s website.
 Another task we have is digging through log files, event viewers, debug consoles (Java), ... to figure out what went wrong and why, and try to find a fix for this issue. If we have found a fix we either need to escalate the fix to our 2nd Line, OR write …</span>

                              <span>I have to make my thesis on creating a web course about some basics of network management and monitoring.
 For this I have to create a basic test environment for students to use, and it&#x27;s currently open if it&#x27;s going to be a few nodes inside Virtualbox that the student runs locally, or a school-hosted Eve-NG virtualization environment. I think that besides the basic SNMP theory, I will give some Net-SNMP examples first and then dig into an NMS.
 My instructor has given me two NMSs to choose from: Nagios core and Zenoss core.
 Which NMS would be better to use for creating lab exercises, which are intended to give a basic concept of network management. Should I even pick one or rather use both?
 I have Nagios Cookbook and Zenoss Core Network and system Administration as my source material for both NMSs.

                              <span>These days it seems like every single application needs to have some service or process to keep on running once it is &quot;closed&quot;. At least give us the option to have that on or not.
 When I&#x27;m using an application fine have all the other services running, but when I close the app, close all your related processes.
 Anyone know of a tool do that type of clean up, I&#x27;m almost tempted to build one.

                              <span>I work for a company that provides IT servicies for other companies, we often struggle to have everything under control.
 IE: In the last month we had to patch every Exchange and every Fortigate for some bugs, mailing the client, but finding everyone required too much time.
 We also provide a monitoring software for the IT infrastructure but not everyone is willing to pay for that service so for everyone else, we got to check one by one or check manually every documents of the infrastructure we radct after the installation and configuration.
 What i&#x27;m looking for:Something that when a new infrastructure is installed i can... dunno, click some checkbox for every main system installed so if i need to know who have Exchange I&#x27;ll have a list.
 A plus would be also something that can create or manage a mass mail for every group, I.E., got a problem with one thing, i can mass mail everyone who has that system.
 Do something like this exists? What do you do to keep everything organized?
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>Hi all
 I&#x27;m hoping someone can shed some light before I go a little crazy.
 I know others have also had this problem as I&#x27;ve seen threads, but everyones is slightly different.
 2019 environment running RDS (With FSLogix) (Hosted in a DC)
 365 Apps for Enterprise - Shared License (E3)
 Back in May/June - all users received an activation issue - office wouldn&#x27;t activate at all
 Microsoft pushed me around, placing registries keys like EnableADAL and DisableADALatopWAMOverride then it started to work but I didn&#x27;t really want to use either of these keys long term... I was also advised to use: AlwaysUseMSOAuthForAutoDiscover&#x3D;1 but I haven&#x27;t removed this key as of yet.
 We continued to have problems for the months with Activation (not licensed) or &#x27;these set of folders can&#x27;t be opened&#x27;
 The main fix after a lot of research seemed to have been the Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin was missing/corrupted. I&#x27;ve been able to mostly fix this with a logon script that checks + reinstall with the following:
 if (-not (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin)) { Add-AppxPackage -Register &quot;$env:windir\SystemApps\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy\Appxmanifest.xml&quot; -DisableDevelopmentMode -ForceApplicationShutdown } Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin 
 For the most part, this script has fixed the daily problems but occasionally, for different people, randomly when they logon in the morning, they won&#x27;t be able to open Outlook as it&#x27;ll say &#x27;these set of folders can&#x27;t be opened&#x27; - AAD BrokerPlugin is installed and the main fix is to open Word, go to File &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign out and then sign straight back in. You can then open Outlook straight away - it&#x27;s a frustrating little resolution.
 Has this else experienced this too? Anyone able to provide some insight or suggestions for a final fix?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 We have a hybrid Exchange 2016 organisation. I finished migrating the last mailbox to exchange online. I have updated MX records and autodiscover (now pointing to EXO). We keep AD on prem.
 A the moment firewall port 25, 80 and 443 are still forwarded to our on prem mailserver. 
 The purpose of migrating to exchange online was to avoid the vulnerabilities of exchange on prem.
 So how can I disable OWA, and all unnecessary access from WAN to our exchange server?
 Do the ports still need to be forwarded? I read that some are necessary for AD connect?
 Thomas.

                              <span>Hey guys 👋 first post here cause I’m kinda lost.
 Have a client that uses load balancing on their SQL server, randomly today all their databases on SSMS 2012 are completely inaccessible, drop-down menu on left panel won’t even expand just sits as (expanding…)
 This is my only client using load balancing &amp; I can’t find anything online for this but I’m certain this is due to the load balancing on his sever. 
 All feedback very appreciated :)

 I want to know when a IIS URL rewrite rule was created. Is this logged anywhere?
 Lately there has been found new exploits regarding CVE-2022-41040 - One mitigation is to make a IIS URL rewrite rule. One of my exchanges was missing this rule but has it now. I want to know when the rule was created.

                              <span>Hi all,
 We&#x27;re taking part in this years Gone Phishing Tournament and have gone through the setup process as instructed. The test email came through, bypassing the mail server filters and I uploaded a list of all users as instructed.
 This morning, I get an email from an end user saying they had received an email over the weekend about a &quot;Gone Phishing Tournament&quot;. It appears they have been sent the same initial setup instructions that I received in September. A quick message trace shows that everyone in the company has received the same setup email! So now this tournament is no longer a surprise to anyone and has basically been ruined. 
 Has this happened to anyone else? I&#x27;ve contacted their support team and await their reply. I&#x27;ve looked back through the instructions and at no point does it say the uploaded user list will receive this email.

 I&#x27;m thinking of switching our org (35 seats) from N-Able to Automox. Any input on this? Seems to have way better patch management, but missing some features like remote PowerShell shell, etc.

                              <span>Few days ago, we discussed the newly -released grant control that helps us to apply phishing-resistant MFA.https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/xxy1hl/apply_this_new_phishingresistant_mfa_setting_to/
 Today I observed that we can also add a custom authentication type by combining any type of multi-factor authentication.
 By default, Microsoft has categorized three authentication modes under grant control. They are, 
  
Basic multi-factor authentication. 
 Passwordless multi-factor authentication. 
 Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication. 
  
Now the cherry on top of this, we can also create a custom authentication type based on your requirement. You can combine any type of multi-factor authentication of your wish and apply it to your users. It can significantly help in disabling weaker authentication methods, such as SMS and calls.
 How do you think this custom authentication type can be used for your organization?

                              <span>So I am more of a network guy but as we all do, I wear a bunch of hats and help the server guys alot. We have several (like 10) synology NAS devices in the network for our backup solution. Veeam backs up to these devices. Can anyone give me a good reason these are not ready for enterprise setup? To me they are just a solution thats not really expensive, but maybe not the ideal solution. 
 I have had a 3rd party in our stuff saying X is wrong or Y is wrong and so far its been things that are not actually a big deal. Example: They complained about the m.2 drives the NAS uses as not being enterprise. (The m.2 is simply a cache drive). They have also been looking at the network side of things and making, honestly dumb suggestions. Dumb as in replacing our backbone with a different manufacturer for network hardware.

I have multiple documents online in which they are showing we can do VPC peering that is fine, but how we can create one endpoint which will communicate under openVPN network. We are using ISTIO as our ingress, how to create openVPN based ingress gateway. Please help me.

 Customer creates a ticket on Jira which is accessible via the internet. There is no &quot;service desk&quot; that will assign the ticket to the appropriate team, i.e. Bug team, Development team as the everyone in the company uses 1 account. which is customercareATcompanynameDOTcom
 And we are all required to download the Jira app on our mobile phone sign in with the same credentials as everyone else (customercareATcompanynameDOTcom) meaning your phone gets flooded every other hour for every single ticket that has been crea…</span>

 So Microsoft turned off Basic Authentication and I though I had everything under control. Sadly I missed our own Servicedesk :-D This is spiceworks on-premise.
 Does anybody know of a software that can work as an inbetween so it is possible to connect through Imap/Pop3 and the software can connect to Exchange via Modern Auth?
 Or should I just start looking for a new ticket system?

                              <span>Hello All,
 Basically in one of our servers We got an alert about the CMOS battery
 I contacted IBM with the logs and they sent me a CMOS battery
 I managed to finally remove the old CMOS battery and insert this new one 
 However the CMOS battery bay holder is lose
 The CMOS battery bay in the server 
 ibm 3550 m5 
 Sits like this 
 https://i.postimg.cc/5053cmm0/Screenshot-2022-10-10-17-23-48-027-edit-com-android-chrome.jpg
 And the CMOS battery bay that seems lose has these plastic things as shown below
 https://i.postimg.cc/gkjv4p1r/Screenshot-2022-10-10-17-15-52-984-edit-com-miui-gallery.jpg
 that holds it ( it is NOT soldered to the board ) when I was trying to clip off the last battery I may have losened it
 Now when I plugged the new battery in the IBM server ImM console gives the same error saying something about a faulty battery so my questions are
 @ the server boots up and is functional without any noises and when the new CMOS battery was inserted it changed the IBM IMM time date to 1999 - does this mean anything ?
 @ also do I have to replace the whole motherboard or the CMOS battery being lose could it be a problem ? I mean it&#x27;s placed fine - or could I tighten it from the back ? 
 @ does anyone know what the problem is ?
 Thanks !

                              <span>Hi, we&#x27;re an small ISP that needs a solution regarding MPLS Devices. Right now we&#x27;re using Mikrotik but its so unstable that we decides to get a more better device with limited budget. Any advise what device that should we acquired ? We&#x27;re needs some device that can do traffic engineering and VPLS , capable to the fast reroute on OSPF, and running P/PE roles. Throughput right now is approximately 3-5Gbps, but seems we also need advise to if our traffic reaches 10Gbps between site. Thanks before.

                              <span>Hello
 I have some networking knowledge and experience, but I am still growing my skills and advancing my career. 
 I was thinking about how layer 3 switching for interVLAN routing is more efficient and quicker due to the ASICs and such for routing traffic between VLANs compared to a standard firewall with inspection and such. But layer 3 switching ACLs are very basic and doesn&#x27;t allow any sort of traffic inspection/analysis. 
 Firewalls have all the great security features for traffic inspection and analysis, but can the bottleneck/slower for interVLAN routing to internal systems.
 One scenario I can think of is; lets say you have a media department (10+ people) that works with a lot of large files and directly edits off a network share through a 10gb link connected to their desktops. Using a firewall to separate the server network and their desktop network (as well as all the other standard user networks) may be the bottleneck when it comes to those connections but more secure for internal threats. Layer 3 switching would be faster, but way less security to defend against internal threats as well as more complicated to maintain with ACLs the larger the distribution layer grows. Or is this just a money problem and a beefier firewall should be purchased to handle something like this?
 I guess the question is, at what point do you choose firewall or layer 3 switch for interVLAN routing and ensuring the network is properly secure and why?

                              <span>Hey,
 My company has recently decided to take on a new project. There are going to be around 130 dorm rooms, all of which are going to need a private (Isolated) network.
 Our networking team are planning to just YEET 150 VLANs in a switch stack and hook each VLAN up to their own dorm.
 The question:
 Is there a better way to achieve the same result? This way feels outdated, but I can&#x27;t seem to think of a better answer.
 Thanks in advance.
 Michael

                              <span>Either I’m having a brain fart or it actually has to be setup this way. 
 We have around 500+ street cabinets all providing FTTP to residential properties. The business will be rolling out open gear to provide out of band console access to each and every cab. 
 From what I’ve been told for the rollout the open gear has cellular connectivity and will run an IPSec tunnel back to the DC. Now, in my mind that means we’ll have 500+ IPSec tunnels terminating on the firewall. That’s a heck of a lot of tunnels, is this a typical deployment for OpenGear or is there a better way I’m just not seeing?

                              <span>hey, guys hello, I am writing my resume and I need some advice doing this.
 so in the experience section where we put our projects and all, HR and recruiters insist on in addition to the thing you do you also should add and quantify the impact of what you did in other words the added value of the project, I totally understand this but as network engineers how we can quantify this?
 for example, let&#x27;s say that I deployed the X firewall in the Y company or I configured a VPN between the main site and the secondary site how can I quantify and measure the added value/impact for these projects? if we take let&#x27;s say a digital marketing agent he can just say that he did the X marketing campaign that increased traffic by Y% to the client&#x27;s website or increased sales by Z amount, i cant figure out how to have a similar take for network engineering?

                              <span>In packet-switching networks, there exist four types of delays:
  
Processing delay
 Queuing delay
 Propagation delay
 Transmission delay
  
Are these delays due to the implementation of the store-and-forward flow control?
 And if another flow control (like cut-through switching or worm-hole switching) doesn&#x27;t that affect these kinds of latency?
 For example (according to my understanding) in cut-through switching the processing delay is almost eliminated if not at all.

 For those of you in these dual environments, are you running a combo of Intune and Jamf (or similar), or is there a better &quot;one size fits all&quot; solution?

                              <span>Have been trying to find some tutorials and software for diskless booting of windows 10 from iscsi (not just install, but full on running) and all videos and blogs are like from 2009, referencing windows XP and 7 at best. Which makes me wonder, is this still a thing ? are there any tools with proper enterprise support for it out there ? MS support page for windows server has a section about benefits o booting from iscsi, but totally does not explain how to do it.... Can someone point me in the right direction?
 I&#x27;ve got an environment with a large SAN already in place and a lot of hardware rotation for client workstations, where booting from iscsi would be perfect solution to a lot of challenges

One of our network engineers noticed a lot of Broadcast (ARP) traffic with the info stating &quot;Who has ? Tell &quot;. Does SolarWinds Orion normally behave like that in a corporate network? I sort of get the idea that it might, but it seems excessive the amount of broadcast traffic we are seeing at any given point, even if we aren&#x27;t doing discoveries at that point.

                              <span>Hi,
 so I have this one client who wants to migrate from O365 to Google Workspace (reason is not important). Circa 50 users.
 I already tried all the tools that Google recommend for migrating from O365 but NONE of them worked and the documentation is DOG SHIT. The only way I was able to migrate a mailbox (test mail) was manual process by making a content search on O365 and uploading the PST file to Gmail. I need to automate the migration and I am now thinking if I should rather just create my own migrating tool with powershell/C# and use Google/Graph REST apis... but that could potentially scale the price 3 times the initial budget.
 Has anyone here migrated from O365 to Google workspace (Gmail primarily)? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

 while https://www.leagueoflegends.com works perfectly and is their main page, if you go to https://leagueoflegends.com which should redirect you, you receive an SSL Error.
 Small blunder but that happens during &quot;Worlds&quot; their biggest tournament and I would love to see if the click rate dropped since the cert got invalidated (yesterday).
 Happens to all of us, so monitor your stuff and try to always have documentation for these changes in order to not forget some .conf files!
 Have a quiet weekend and don&#x27;t forget tomorrow is read-(mails/tickets)-only Monday
 Edit: Riot saw this thread and apparently fixed it:)

                              <span>Hello,
 So, I will need your help on this one.
 I have users that work on company laptops (ad-joined), they log in using their AD credentials as Standard Users.
 When they work from home, they connect to the company VPN. However, if they won&#x27;t connect to VPN, their credentials are cached on the laptop so they can still log in to their account.
 Sometimes, let&#x27;s assume that the VPN connection is broken, I want to remotely configure a setting or two (via Anydesk) using a local administrator account without being connected to the VPN. Not being connected to VPN means that I cannot grant a user local admin rights to overcome this.
 How can I configure a local admin account (maybe with cached creds) so that I can still support these remote users? Actually, what I am asking is the best practice covering both security and ease of access, how are you guys implementing a similar case?
 I should mention that we are not using LAPS or any other Endpoint Privilege Management software, we are considering this scenario though.

                              <span>Microsoft has now disabled basic auth for Office 365, with the minor exception of SMTP. While SMTP Basic Auth is not going away because of mostly legacy devices or applications, it&#x27;s better to switch to oAuth 2.0 and Graph API as per Microsoft&#x27;s recommendation.
 The more significant issue is that Microsoft points you to Graph API documentation, specifically this link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-sendmail. If you want to upload attachments higher than 4MB, they send you to this link https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/outlook-large-attachments where after a brief moment, you decide to drop that idea and not send emails with larger attachments ;-)
 Over one year ago, I wrote a PowerShell module called Mailozaurr, which simplifies sending emails with SMTP using BASIC …</span>

Our CA is about to expire but the certificates issued by it are valid for another year. Can we simply replace the expiring CA with a renewed one and the already issued certificates will continue to be trusted? Or do we need to reissue the server certificates as well?
 I ran a test on my PC by just replacing the CA in my certificate store and browsing to some internal sites. Chrome automatically accepted the new CA as the issuer but Firefox did not.

When I click on that link, there is no mention that this KB addresses the issue and it mentions a different cve number.
 Any idea how I am supposed to be reading these CVE numbers?

                              <span>had an unusual issue with my linux server (ubuntu 22.04LTS) today where I would get the following behaviour:
 ls of my users root directly would hang until ctrl+c
 tab autocomplete when used in home directory would hang and lock up the shell
 other random issues which turned out to be things trying to look in the home directory 
 turns out its the windows 11 RDP bug causing an issue with XRDP and the thinclient_drives directory causes this unusual behaviour. 
 disabling the UDP part of the rdp client on the windows box solves the issue.
 more info on the issue that seems to cause this behaviour here:
 https://pureinfotech.com/windows-11-22h2-bug-remote-desktop/ 
 there may be a way to block the issue server side too but I havent looked
 this had me going around in circles for a bit as linking &quot;ls&quot; not working on linux server to a windows rdp client problem was unexpected... 
 although probably an edge case of using rdp to connect to a linux box I figured I would drop this here just in case someone is pulling their hair out.

 The name of the AD domain is using a routable, owned domain MyCompany.net.
 However, our email and public domain is using MyCompany.com.
 Now we are migrating to M365 and Azure AD as our preferred IDP and AWS for our computing platform.
 What advantages would I gain in using natively the .com DNS zone ? Should I be looking at how we ccould switch to using the .com TLD ?

                              <span>Hey there. First time post long time lurker.
 My general question is this: When should I generally start looking at migrating over to the sysadmin side?
 I always find it hard to determine when to move up due to the incessant voice in the back of my head telling me I don&#x27;t know enough yet. Basically just looking to get outside opinions on if its time to move onwards and upwards. 
 My experience is as follows:
 3 years government contractor service desk
 2.5 years MSP work as a &quot;engineer&quot; but still basically a t2 service desk that handled everything that could be remotely done
 Currently at a top backup solutions company as a support engineer for about a year
 Salary is around 65k currently so im only slightly lower than the sys admin range already for my area
 Certs:
 Windows operation system fundamentals
 Fortinet NSE 1-3
 Cloud +
 Could pass Security+ in about a week or 2 
 Any opinions helpful and feel free to remove if this isnt the right place for this but just looking for some help!

                              <span>So TV is not an issue. Able to cast from non-organization laptops.
 Also tried to cast from company laptop to a microsoft wirelessdisplay adapter, same issue.
 ​
 Have read items about GPOs, but so far I&#x27;ve found no GPO affecting wireless settings that would block miracast (allow creation of public profiles, uncheck &quot;don&#x27;t allow wifi-direct groups&quot;)
 ​
 Tried a brand new pc and installed to it the web proxy, antivirus, firewalls, etc.. and it still seems to connect fine. So something to the other pcs is causing the connection to block but can&#x27;t pin point anything.
 ​
 Checked on Event viewer, wlan autoconfig log and I do see it starts and connects and then stops it, but nothing telling anything as to why it&#x27;s doing it.
 ​
 Anybody ran into anything similar?
 ​
 Company just built new state of the art facilities with lots of TVs and well this will look terribly on me unable to cast laptop display on these screens. I&#x27;ve put HDMI on some, but I know it&#x27;s just convenient to do the miracast. 
 ​
 Tried an HDMI wireless transmitter, that works, but image quality sucks.

 If a disk fails with a RAID 0 setup, is data recoverable from the remaining active/working disk, or is the data completely useless given that striping writes each file across both drives?
 Thanks

 Besides physical destruction, is Parted Magic the best way to securely erase an SSD? Is it true that enabling Bitlocker after data has been copied on the drive is useless?

 We’re about to change out anti-virus to Defender for Business. I’ve got it working for windows 10/11 but server 2012r2 seem to be having issues. Got it enrolled via the onboarding script but I’ve got an alert saying “onboarding for defender for endpoint failed to register to ADD due to ADD connect missconfiguration”. The server is not in ADD as it’s not supported. Server 2012R2 is supported for Defender for Business…. Is there something I’m missing? Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>I work IT and a co-worker / friend left my org for a net admin position at a local college. I was chatting with him via text to say hi and asking him about the job, etc. He mentioned they don&#x27;t use NAT and that all the devices are assigned public IPs, which he also said are all behind a firewall. I replied with concern and confusion and he just said that the college was issued a /16 block back in the early Internet days and that they&#x27;ve just been using those. We didn&#x27;t really chat much more but I was wondering about this. 
 Wouldn&#x27;t this be a massive security concern as well as a massive waste of public IP addresses? Also, how would you be behind a firewall and also be using public IPs without NAT unless your router/firewall was right at the ISP level? 
 I&#x27;m assuming I&#x27;m missing something here so I figured I&#x27;d ask for some insight in this sub.

                              <span>I made a mistake and ordered a ISR 4221 Cisco Router to upgrade from a 1921 for one of my clients as I am a freelance admin for a few people in my local area and it’s capping our network speed on all our devices to 35mbps or lower. I know I need to purchase a BOOST license to increase the speed and in turn it’ll cost me some features but is there a way to do this without the license ? Any alternative’s anyone could suggest would also be greatly appreciated, thanks for reading!

                              <span>Up until now, we&#x27;ve been using Microsoft NPS as RADIUS for our wireless authentication. Aruba APs have an internal WPA2-Enterprise SSID. In NPS, we have two policies; one for allowing domain joined devices, and one allowing domain users. When a domain joined laptop turns on and Windows starts, it connects to the SSID specified in a GPO assigned wireless profile (hitting the &quot;allow domain joined devices&quot; policy), and when the user signs in, authentication to wireless changes to the user (hitting the &quot;allow domain users&quot; policy). Simple. MSCHAPv2 EAP-PEAP, valid certificate, it works.
 Problem 1: BYOD. There&#x27;s a separate WPA2-Enterprise BYOD SSID that also uses NPS so users can connect with their own credentials. The obvious problem here is that anyone can simply use their credentials with t…</span>

                              <span>Assuming you have bought a full featured DWDM setup, and have the correct fiber and SFPs to support the additional lambdas, do the hardware companies charge for adding a lambda?
 Question I am really asking is about Googles decision to charge for 4k video. Is Google having to pay extra for the incremental bandwidth to the ISP exchange sites? Don&#x27;t they just turn up an additional lambda on a link to deliver more bandwidth from their Datacenters \ Edge centers to the ISP exchange? 
 I am assuming they are using 10 of the 16 lambdas that their gear has available, and they just need to increase to the 11th lambda, and there is no cost for that incremental lambda.
 Obviously when they need to bring up an additional fiber link, and activate a full port and pay the full freight for that link.

I measure the network convergence time (not in the event of a failure, but in what time from the moment of starting the network the convergence is achieved, of course, excluding the times of starting the router) and the lower time results are achieved by IS-IS. I can&#x27;t understand why this is happening, because to my knowledge both protocols calculate the route with the same SPF algorithm, and in the point-to-point setting both skip the DR/BDR and DIS selection step. Research is done on the same equipment, repeated many times, the trend is always the same. Could someone explain where the better result for IS-IS might be coming from?

                              <span>Client A is connected to the public internet.
  
Client B gateway address is connected to the Client A&#x27;s network interface.
 Client B is running a Web browser which is sending requests to 127.0.0.1:1234 HTTP Proxy, which encrypts and sends the packets ahead to Client A&#x27;s machine then to -&gt; ISP -&gt; Public Internet.
 
  
By what means could it be possible for Client A&#x27;s machine to sniff or intercept the unencrypteddecrypted packets between Client B&#x27;s web browser and the HTTP proxy on 0.0.0.0:1234? Means such as firewall turned off on B, open ports on B, attaching a listener, promiscuous mode, DHCP, or any kind of poisoning, or any other way?
 How can this be done?

                              <span>Edit: Solved;
 I got it working. For some reason opnsense did not like using only tagged VLANS on an interface. Once I chose and setup one of the VLANS to be untagged, I could setup all others as tagged. 
  
I&#x27;ve been trying to get a little lab setup using two Zyxel GS1900-XX switches. It works fine if using just the main (GS-1900-24) switch. But no go if using a port on the office (GS1900-16) switch. It seems that VLAN 5 (LAB VLAN) is not traversing the link between the two switches (port 24 on main switch &amp; port 15 on office switch), although VLAN 1 does just fine.
 If I plug my laptop into port 5 on the main switch (untagged VLAN 5), it successfully pulls a DHCP address from the VLAN 5 interface on my router connected to the main switch (ports 3-4, LAGG, tagged VLAN 5).
 If I try to plug the laptop into any of the 6 x VLAN 5 ports (ports 1-6, untagged on office switch) it will not pull a DHCP address and cannot ping the VLAN 5 router interface (10.71.17.254) if I set the address manually.
 I am including screenshots of all applicable switch and router settings.
 I would really appreciate any help I could get from you fine people.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I have just put a WLAN access point into operation to test it for a future customer environment. During the configuration, I fought for a long time until the access point was assigned an IP address by my DHCP server. The trick was that the AccessPoint had the wrong time settings. As i set them to the same time as my DHCP server the AccessPoint received a IP address.
 Can someone explain at what point in the DORA process does actual time play a role? And also how the time is used? Would really interest me 🤔

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I have a Dell M1000e with 4 M630 blades with Intel X710 10Gb network adapters and a single M8024-k in slot A1. I cannot seem to get any of the blades to connect at 10Gb/s, they all negotiate to 1Gb/s.
 I have one blade running Ubuntu Server 20.04, and three running Windows Server 2019. None of them will negotiate the 10Gb/s link. The Ubuntu box gives me an option to force the link to 10Gb/s but it loses connection, and the Windows ones provide no configuration for it.
 I have also tried forcing the connected switch ports to 10Gb/s for the blades (also tested with forcing it on the Ubuntu blade) to no avail.
 The M1000e has the v1.1 midplane, the switch has been upgraded to the latest firmware, and I&#x27;ve installed the latest intel drivers on the windows blades.
 I also have another 10Gb/s switch and a 10Gb/s NAS plugged in to the external SFP+ ports and both of those negotiate 10Gb/s without issue.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

                              <span>I work in a medium-sized company and am responsible for IT. Although I&#x27;m bad at networking, that&#x27;s also part of my responsibility. Recently, when starting the computer do not get into the network. Only some do not find the network. And it may be that this does not occur every day. We have a DHCP server which distributes the IP addresses. Sometimes computers just don&#x27;t get an IP address and they get a default IP and are not in the domain because they can&#x27;t find the DNS and DHCP server. The workaround is when you unplug the network cable and plug it back in or turn the PC off and on again. Both does not always work and you have to test which variant works. Of the 250 computers, not always the same computers are affected, but different ones. Now my consideration is to give each computer a fixed IP address, there is otherwise no solution. Is it usual with a company size to give the computers fixed IP addresses? Or is a DHCP server the better choice? Sorry for my bad english

 I do not see the need for these roles to be added to the service account to remove another point of attack but unsure of any repercussions that may happen if removed.
 ​
 As far as I see all the service account needs is to have the owner role for the Azure stuff that is separate from administrating anything related to AD Azure or O365 but want a second thought.

                              <span>Hello all, 
 I hope everyone is doing well this weekend. 
 First time posting on reddit and here, we have a hypervisor in which we are going to repurpose into a file server using TrueNAS. 
 The server motherboard is: X9QR7-TF+
 I would like to know if I can perform a firmware upgrade so that IPMI uses HTML 5 instead of Java, I can&#x27;t seem to find any information on it and I was wondering if anyone else has the answer? 
 Thank you in advance

                              <span>I apologize if this post is against the rules. I&#x27;m not asking for support. I&#x27;m wanting to either confirm or deny a perception I&#x27;ve made.
 It seems like Windows can occasionally become erratic in small ways until I install pending updates. This can be anything from weirdness with a mouse being difficult to control to losing internet connection on a single machine seemingly at random. Other devices are fine. What has me pointing to Windows updates specifically is that even though my apps, test pings, etc. all return error responses Windows update can sure as shit download updates and install them no problem.
 These usually go away with the handy dandy restart as well (even if I don&#x27;t install the updates yet) but crop up soon again before long. I&#x27;ve noticed this for years and ran into it again today (the no internet issue specifically) and finally thought to ask. Between these periods my experience is pretty good until they happen again and quite usually there are pending updates. Rinse and repeat. It&#x27;s not even an every time thing though quite often I am prompt about installing them once I notice the icon. Occasionally when I&#x27;m not though is when I&#x27;ve noticed this behavior.
 What gives? Am I mixing correlation/causation? It&#x27;s hard to imagine Windows having poison pill code to prod users into installing updates, but honestly it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me either.
 Edit: Thank god I&#x27;m not alone. 🙏

                              <span>When I set out to implement syncing with cloud-hosted Snipe-It, I wanted a solution flexible enough to deal with possible problems in the source data. The result is a set of PowerShell scripts utilizing snazy2000&#x27;s excellent SnipeitPS module ( https://github.com/snazy2000/SnipeitPS). The main premise is flexibility, working off cache wherever possible, and creating and assigning entities in snipe-it when needed (departments, companies, locations, etc.). The scripts can be found on github at https://github.com/mattcarras/SnipeItSyncPS.
 Quick tidbits about each script:
 - SnipeIt-Sync-PS.ps1: The main API script, which is dot-sourced by the other two scripts. Requires snazy2000&#x27;s SnipeitPS module.
 - SnipeIt-AD-Sync.ps1: Complete script for syncing user information from AD. Syncs the SID to the EmployeeNum field by default for greater flexibility. Supports all fields supported by SnipeitPS, including syncing info about departments, companies, and managers, as well as setting groups. Also supports flagging or deleting users which no longer exist in AD. Should work with minimal changes. Also technically supports updating passwords, it&#x27;s recommended to use SSO instead.
 - SnipeIt-Asset-Sync.ps1: Script for syncing asset information from previously exported CSV, direct from SCCM via WMI, direct from AD, or direct WMI queries. You will need to set the fields in each function to match whatever you&#x27;re importing.
 Hopefully the scripts may prove useful in some way. Feel free to build your own syncing solution using parts or all of the API. And while the scripts are currently being used in an enterprise environment without issue, feel free to submit bug reports on github if you encounter any problems.

                              <span>Hi all,
 We’re managing Chrome updates via Intune policy (the old method with OMA-URI components). Found that several user groups weren’t being governed by this policy and added them. Now I’m potentially in some dire straits…
 Some users who had newer versions than what we needed to use had their Chrome installs rolled back to the assigned version. When this happened, is basically reset the browser to zero - all bookmarks, passwords, auto fill data, etc. is gone. I verified by doing it to my computer that you can restore the data if you were signed into a Google account before the reset (sign back in and turn on sync).
 However, if a user wasn’t signed into a Google account before their browser was reset, does anyone know if there is any way to restore this data short of a full system rollback?

 We struggle to keep a lid on subscriptions and cloud resources for our tiny organization. Large companies (and government!) are probably oversubscribed massively.
 ​
 Since inception, one of the top reasons to &quot;go cloud&quot; was the flexibility of ramping up and down as the business climate dictates. Now many organizations don&#x27;t even have a handle on their cloud spend. It&#x27;s going to be almost impossible to cut back on these expenditures.

                              <span>Hello!
 I am hoping to get a creative solution for what I am looking to do. 
 I want to prepend text to the subject of messages identified as spam or potentially malicious for ALL incoming emails, but want to only move messages from certain external domains to a user’s Junk Email folder, organization-wide.
 It seems impossible to both move items to the Junk Email folder AND prepend the subject, in general. 
 Is there any possible creative way to achieve this? 
 Thanks in advance!

 I haven&#x27;t left the country in 8 years because I just can&#x27;t be away. I work lunch every day and rarely take more than 5 days holiday a year for the last 6 years. I can&#x27;t be away from my phone ever. I work insane hours. My weekends and evenings are work. IT Security also stresses me out. 
 Our Company is growing at an exponential rate and the board of Directors are not listening to genuine concerns that I have regarding the IT infrastructure not aligning with the growth plans.

                              <span>We have a Citrix environment with Server 2019 servers. We would like to have our users Outlook mailboxes indexed and be able to roam this index between the Citrix servers. We use O365/Exchange Online so the mailboxes are in cached mode. We are using Citrix UPM for handling the user profiles, and FSLogix Office Containers for handling the cached ost-files.
 ​
 Everything seems to be working fine, except the fact that the search index for Outlook does not seem to work. We are letting Server 2019 handle the search database - not UPM or FSLogix - as per MS recommendation. We can see that the per-user database (.edb file) is created in the user profiles. However, they do not seem to update and the size of the .edb files never increases from the initial size of 8196 KB. 
 When we look at the indexing status in Outlook, it shows that Outlook is a location that should be indexed, but it also shows that 0 items have been indexed. And it shows that 0 items are still needed to be indexed. 
 On a normal Windows 10 PC with Outlook it shows how many items have been indexed. And I&#x27;ve read somewhere that the size of the per-user database .edb should increase, when indexing large mailboxes. 
 So what is your experience - is it normal that Outlook shows 0 items indexed? To me this indicates that something is not right? And should&#x27;t the size of the .edb in the user profile increase, when indexing large mailboxes (10-15 GB ost-files)? Thanks!

The user being lockout every morning, I check the event id 4740 (Lockout), is earlier the time that the user tried login (I work together with her). The caller computer name is blank instead of login computer name for normal failure theshold reached. May I know what information I should check to indentify the root cause of the lockout.

                              <span>Dear all,
 I recently got a used LTO-7 for quite a bargain - almost for free so no hard feelings here.
 Its IBM FC HH drive, connected via FC 8gb qlogic qle2562 to server, put in a BDT Flexstor II (oem tl2000/ts3100/msl2024...) 24 slot library
 The drive however acts a bit strange. When booting up everything is ok, no errors, no faults, no lights...
 The drive passes ITDT health test with all passed. Since i only use lto6 at home i also only tested lto6. Speed it does in health test is 151 mb/s, not full 160, but no failure either.
 I then started full write test. That fails after about 1 hour with EC 6 in ITDT and F3 01 SCD 5 Dtive broken on the library. Wont accept tapes or anything unless powercycled. After powercycle all good.
 What i dont understand is, why does the drive pass health test but fails full write. Both failed ok, but one passed one failed doesnt add up for me.
 Use data: 12/2018 built, 1200 day Power on time, 40 power cycles, 40 cleans so far in lifetime, 3000 catridge loads.
 Newest firmware is installed.
 My first guess due to the high load count is worn out head. But can you really wear out a drive in just 3 years? My other hp drives are 8-10y old and work super fine. Or do you have any other ideas, suggestions, tips?
 If its the head: does anyone have a source for the spare? I am not afraid of a bit DIY, and wont pay 1500 eur to a company to fix it for my home use case (used just for me ar home, have 3 working lto6 drives so i am fine).
 Would be great to find some help.

Since I have gathered over the years Apple and Android devices that I am not using after upgrading to newer devices, I want to use them to setup a small MDM test environment at home to do this. What is a good and free (not trial version if possible) MDM environment with as much capability as possible that I can manage in Windows for Android and iOS devices?

                              <span>I&#x27;m hoping someone can help me with a weird issue I&#x27;ve got with Microsoft 365. I&#x27;ve configured our account to use DKIM authentication, and as far as I can tell it&#x27;s all setup correctly. mxtoolbox shows the DNS records are setup correctly, MS own tools show no issues - everything looks fine.
 When I send a test email out however, I have confusing info in the headers which is confusing me as to whether or not it&#x27;s actually working. It appears I have two &quot;authentication-results&quot; headers with conflicting info. One is &quot;Authentication-Results&quot; and one is &quot;authentication-results&quot; - not sure why both and why they&#x27;re different.
 The relevant headers are:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Received-SPF: pass (zohomail.com: domain of xxxxxx.co.uk designates 40.107.10.53 as permitted sender) client-ip&#x3D;40.107.10.53; envelope-from&#x3D;x…</span>

                              <span>Right. So our old manager was let go and I was promoted to technical team lead. I work for an MSP and I&#x27;m not exactly sure what a tech lead is required to do. For the most part a big chunk of this job has involved reporting and tracking projects and SLA for the support desk. 
 Any ideas of what a technical team lead is supposed to do?

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;m interested in seeing if any other admins are experiencing consistent issues with Cisco AnyConnect in macOS Monterey whether it&#x27;s a Mac upgrading to macOS Monterey or a new Mac fresh out of the box and provisioned.
 The &quot;Certificate Validation Failure&quot; is hitting our Mac community hard and is a growing issue for us. Certificates are deployed and placed in the System keychain via MDM w/ access to the required cert granted to the AnyConnect VPN client.
 Everything else in our configuration can read and access keychain items without issue but AnyConnect appears to have a really hard time validating the certificate it needs.
 When a user is hit with the cert validation error, they can &quot;fix&quot; it by running &quot;security unlock-keychain&quot; in Terminal and successfully activate VPN on the next attempt.
 Is anyone else dealing with this in macOS Monterey as a consistent issue?

                              <span>Hi,
 I guess a question for those who were sys admins at one point and have moved onto other specifically non-management roles?
 How&#x27;d you do it and did you choose or was it more of a progression from your previous role?
 I&#x27;ve been working in IT since 1998. I did what I guess was the natural progression of 1st level helpdesk -&gt;desktop support -&gt;sys admin. Made it from my 1st job to sys admin in 2.5 years and aside from a few failed forays into other areas, I&#x27;ve remained a sys admin almost exclusively since early 2001. I had a brief go as a team leader/management and discovered very quickly it was not for me. 
 I&#x27;ve been working project implementations exclusively for 5 years now and do enjoy the work. I tend to become the goto guy fairly quickly on projects (not saying I am perfect or know everything, far from it. I think it&#x27;s just an age/experience thing and probably happens to everyone who has been around for 20+ years and a lot of the ppl I work with are younger than me)
 I&#x27;m curious about infra architecture roles but really don&#x27;t know what the day to day is like and how to go about moving into that area.
 Thanks!

I certainly don’t want to run through the installer 10 times. Is there any way to build images with e.g. LUKS configured, dropbear installed, timezone end locale applied etc? What’s the easiest way?

                              <span>Hi,
 I receive a few emails a month containing DMARC Report Domain: domain.com. I&#x27;m not sure if need to action them, and if so, how to.
 Just now though, I have received a lot of them at once. I have attached 2 images . I&#x27;m hoping someone can explain what triggers this to happen and if I need to do anything.
 Images: https://imgur.com/a/HCDSarG
 Email is hosted via Google Workspace Education. I have SPF, DMARC etc setup.
 Also, I&#x27;m not sure if this is relevant, but on MXToolbox I get these warnings: (only noticed just now, has been perfect last time I checked months ago)
 Status Warning smtp aspmx.l.google.com Reverse DNS does not match SMTP Banner information More Info
 Status Warning smtp alt4.aspmx.l.google.com Reverse DNS does not match SMTP Banner information More Info
 Status Warning smtp alt1.aspmx.l.google.com Reverse DNS does not match SMTP Banner information More Info
 Status Warning smtp alt3.aspmx.l.google.com Reverse DNS does not match SMTP Banner information More Info
 Status Warning smtp alt2.aspmx.l.google.com Reverse DNS does not match SMTP Banner
 Any help, as always, is very much appreciated. Thank you.

                              <span>Hello everyone. I&#x27;ve been a long time lurker of this sub for about 5+ years. I come to you all with a dilemma I am experiencing. Although I am sure many of you would not consider this to be a dilemma at all. 
 So let me start off by saying I was recently offered a position as a Systems Administrator for a medium sized business with about 100 - 200 employees. Prior to this my only experience was working at a PC and cell phone repair shop. I do have a bachelors in IT, A+, CCNA, SEC+, Project+, LPI Linux Essentials, AWS Cloud Certified and ITIL V4 certifications. But I have like literally 0 help desk experience.
 I don&#x27;t have much experience besides homelabs. I&#x27;ve never worked in an office IT setting. Frankly, I&#x27;m not even sure why they hired me. I have 0 terminal skills. I understand basic networking concepts and I can Google myself through most user-related issues. The pay is 70k in a medium-cost of living area.
 Am I being overpaid? I feel very guilty because my boss is the nicest boss I have ever worked for, and I almost feel like I am scamming them.

                              <span>I have a DTC4000 and HDP6600. We need to support both printers and the software also needs to support YMCKFO (Foil/UV) ribbon panels.
 Easy Badge requires &quot;Expert Edition&quot; just to support the Foil/UV portion... which is a $1000 more than their standard edition which does everything else we need.
 What do you guys use?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m currently testing AlwaysOn VPN to replace Directaccess.
 It&#x27;s working well, much much faster than DA.
 ​
 But I have a problem regarding migration in a real world scenario.
 when I deploy VPN configuration to a computer, the AOVPN goes up, and DirectAccess stop connecting (as the computer can join the NLS server)
 but as the DirectAccess GPO still applied, we have conflict with NRPT rules and some services doesn&#x27;t work
 I can&#x27;t exclude AOVPN device from DA Policy, because I&#x27;m not sure at which moment the device will get is AOVPN configuration up and running 
 If I remove immediatly, the computer will remove is DA configuration without having AOVPN configuration, and the user will loose corporate access
 Due to covid, we have a lot of remote user. and we don&#x27;t want to have users without connection, having to go to work to repair etc
 Have any of you performed migrations from DA to AOVPN without asking users to come back to the office to have their computer reconfigured by the IT department?

                              <span>I&#x27;m creating this thread to raise awareness on the potential chaos that&#x27;s about to be unleashed this upcoming Patch Tuesday, especially onto the poor souls who run Remote Desktop Services (RDS) on-prem.
 When applying Preview Update KB5017380 to Windows 10, Remote Desktop and RemoteApp connections will break as discovered by /u/geoholz 2 weeks ago. This particular issue was mostly documented on Windows 11&#x27;s latest 22H2 update but it&#x27;s also present on Windows 10.
 TLDR: Turning off UDP (see below) allowed the RemoteApp feeds to re-appear after a gpupdate &amp; reboot.
 Overview
 I noticed users who logged into newly provisioned Windows 10 machines did not receive the RemoteApp desktop feed (configured via GPO and the _msradc DNS TXT entry) like they normally did. Visiting the /RDWeb site worked…</span>

                              <span>Howdy folks,
 Hope this helps some people out who need it. I covered the full SC-900 - Microsoft Security, Compliance &amp; Identity Fundamentals course in one video, the editing for this nearly killed me, well not really, it was just a lot of work to make lol.
 Anyway the video is about almost 5 hours long since it covers the whole dang course obviously. With that said, if someone is looking for something specific in the course, it would take them forever to find it so I added a list in the video description with most of the main topics that are covered with time stamps next to each topic.
 The time stamps will make it quicker and easier for people to find what they are looking for if they don&#x27;t want to watch the whole thing and are just looking for something specific.
 I will be adding a extra video after the course which will have practice questions in it to help prepare for the exam. Now before anyone goes and asks, no, those practice questions are NOT the questions out of the actual official exam, those kinds of questions are against Microsoft&#x27;s rules and not allowed.
 The practice questions I make will however cover the same topics and measure you on the same skills so they are legal and allowed by Microsoft.
 As I said in the beginning, I hope this helps some of you out since I know what it&#x27;s like when your boss/company forces you to write an exam and not being able to find any study resources for it.
 Same can be said for folks who can&#x27;t afford to pay courses or who just can&#x27;t find anything online. This should plug that hole.
 Below is a short 4-5 min course intro video I made which explains the course. The full course will be in the playlist or you can just go look on the channel, whatever floats your boat:

 I am NOT looking for anything fancy. All faxes should go to one email address, and outgoing faxes don&#x27;t need to be supported at all. I can do unauthenticated direct send, or SMTP AUTH.
 If any simple freeware / open source solution exists, they are drowned out in search results by advertisements for subscription cloud-based multi-user smart fax systems with AI and all other buzzwords included. Does anyone know of a simple solution?

                              <span>I have a bunch of different SSL certs for different servers of the same internal AD domain. Example: server1.localdomain.com, server2.localdomain.com, server3.localdomain.com, etc. Some are domain controllers (LDAPS) and some are IIS webservers, among other things.
 I am thinking I should instead purchase a single wildcard certificate for use with all services on my localdomain.com domain. I just don&#x27;t know how that works from the server / CSR perspective. Like I can make a CSR from server1 but I would have to do the same on the others, but it would be the same certificate. 
 I&#x27;m just a little unclear on the best approach. I use DigiCert mainly for 99% of our certs.

                              <span>Hey r/sysadmin!
 Justin from Blackpoint Cyber here!
 If you&#x27;re already a Blackpoint Cyber partner you should have gotten this (sorry for the double alert), but if you&#x27;re not we wanted to make sure it got out to everyone else!
 Blackpoint Cyber is actively monitoring a Fortinet vulnerability involving authentication bypass. Tracked as CVE-2022-40684, users of the following products are vulnerable to attacks:
  
FortiOS: From 7.0.0 to 7.0.6 and from 7.2.0 to 7.2.1
 FortiProxy: From 7.0.0 to 7.0.6 and 7.2.0
  
This vulnerability could lead to remote threat actors logging into unpatched devices and performing operations on the administrative interface via specially crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests.
 How to Mitigate:
 Fortinet released security patches on Thursday, October 6th, advising users to do the following:
  
Update vulnerable devices to FortiOS/FortiProxy versions 7.0.7 or 7.2.2., or
 Perform this workaround: Block remote attackers from bypassing authentication and logging into vulnerable FortiGate and FortiProxy deployments by limiting the IP addresses that can reach the administrative interface using a local-in-policy
  
Important: Blackpoint’s SOC has not seen any indicators of compromise in our partners’ environments.
 Blackpoint’s SOC will continue to actively monitor for any indicators of compromise associated with this vulnerability. We are confident that our experienced MDR analysts and technology will continue to protect your business and clients.
 Sincerely,
 Blackpoint Cyber

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Just looking for some advice on what to do. I&#x27;ll keep this short as I can. 
 I was asked to refresh our storage infrastructure earlier this year. So I gave all of the required information on % growth rates and forecast projects to the supplier who we get hardware from to spec out a new solution. The solution has run out of space only after 6 months of prod usage My boss is fuming and long story short we are buying more storage, however he has said I should have been more vigilant even though they were the ones who used the forecast data to build the under-spec solution and the costs will be coming out of my pay
 Obviously I can&#x27;t afford the cost of this and don&#x27;t believe I should be liable for the failed solution. Is there anything I can do or any recourse?

                              <span>I have a question for all you expert. We have come upon a site with too many files in it. Some of the files can be archive but we are wondering about the best way to do it. We tought about doing subsite but does subsite files count add up to the site count. We also tought about doing a document center but read that it was depreciated. There is also the idee of creating more site! Any idea anyone?

We are a small team of IT people, so I&#x27;m going to be needing to put together some questions for the interview. I have someone else on my team who will likely be adding technical questions, so I&#x27;d like to try to focus a little more on demeanor, interpersonal skills, etc. I&#x27;d love some recommendations from this group who is far more experienced than me.

 Maggie commands
 Analysis of the malware revealed that it disguises as an Extended Stored Procedure DLL (“sqlmaggieAntiVirus_64.dll”) that is digitally signed by DEEPSoft Co. Ltd, a company that appears to be based in South Korea.
 Extended Stored Procedure files extend the functionality of SQL queries by using an API that accepts remote user arguments and responds with unstructured data.
 Maggie abuses this technical behavior to enable remote backdoor access with a rich set of 51 commands.
 A report from DCSO CyTec says that the variety of commands supported by Maggie allow querying for system information, executing programs, interacting with files and folders, enabling remote desktop services (TermService), running a SOCKS5 proxy, and setting up port forwarding.
 The attackers can append arguments to these commands, and Maggie even offers usage instructions for the supported arguments in some cases.

 I sent this thread to a higher up on my team but the IT department is still investigating. Is it possible to find official announcements from BitDefender and/or Cisco to help end the investigation? Now our CIO is getting involved!
 I checked the news and the BitDefender blog but no mention of the problem or fix.

                              <span>Hello, 
 ​
 we have 2 domains each in their own location. There is a VPN connecting between both sites each domain with their own firewall, DNS and DHCP services. We would like to create a two-way trust relationship from Site A to Site B.
 ​
 Does anyone have the correct steps required to create a trust relationship? 
 ​
 My questions are :
 ​
 ​
 1- Here&#x27;s a shortlist of the minimum amount of ports: Am I Correct ?
 ​
 Port Protocol Service
 ​
 53 TCP/UDP DNS
 ​
 88 TCP/UDP Kerberos
 ​
 389 TCP/UDP LDAP
 ​
 445 TCP SMB
 ​
 636 TCP LDAP (SSL)
 ​
 ​
 ​
 2 - Do I have to create two-way tust between the PDC emulator in both domains ?
 ​
 ​
 ​
 My environment:
 ​
 COMPANY A : We have 4 DC &amp; DNS.
 ​
 DC1 is holding all FSMO roles.
 ​
 C:\Windows\system32&gt;netdom query fsmo
 Schema master dc1.contoso.local
 Domain naming master dc1.contoso.local
 PDC dc1.contoso.local
 RID pool manager dc1.contoso.local
 Infrastructure master dc1.contoso.local
 The command completed successfully.
 ​
 ​
 COMPANY B : We have 4 DC &amp; DNS.
 ​
 DC1 is holding all FSMO roles.
 ​
 C:\Windows\system32&gt;netdom query fsmo
 Schema master dc1.companyB.local
 Domain naming master dc1.companyB.local
 PDC dc1.companyB.local
 RID pool manager dc1.companyB.local
 Infrastructure master dc1.companyB.local
 The command completed successfully.

 Thank you

                              <span>Not all MFAs are equal!! As we know, we&#x27;re seeing a spike in multiple MFA attacks like MFA Fatigue on push notification authentication. With all these suspicious MFA attacks, it&#x27;s been hard to cope.
 Thankfully, Microsoft has finally understood our concerns and provided options to choose different MFA security levels for different users. You can find this newly released grant control &quot;require authentication strength in Microsoft conditional access.&quot; Navigate to the path below to find the newly released “require authentication strength” checkbox:
 Azure AD Admin Center --&gt; Azure Active Directory ---&gt; Security (Under Manage Tab) --&gt; Conditional Access.
  
Hereafter, you can opt to allow SMS for base-level workers and implement stronger phishing-resistant MFA for admin &amp; executive accounts.
  
Following a thorough analysis of all authentication methods, Microsoft has categorized three different authentication modes under the grant control. They are, 
  
Basic multi-factor authentication. 
 
Passwordless multi-factor authentication. 
 
Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication. 
  
Note: This is still in &quot;preview&quot; mode. Sadly, it won&#x27;t be available for everyone. Hope it will be rolled out for you soon if you don&#x27;t see it!

I don&#x27;t have a real system in place, other than emailing them shipping labels, and hoping they pack everything up properly and in a timely manner.

                              <span>(TL;DR in bold at the end of the post.)
 I just joined a company that has an IT department, but is not an IT company (banking sector). I&#x27;m the lead of a dozen of programmers/system engineers, and one of the particularity of that team is that more than half of the employees were already working there in the last millennium.
 I can see how some Agile/Kanban/Scrum concepts can help them to be more effective and working as a better team. But I don&#x27;t want to be that &quot;youngster that wants to change everything and introduce micromanagement&quot;. I&#x27;m walking on eggs, even if it&#x27;s a lot of self-inflicted pressure.
 What I don&#x27;t want or need is to implement a full Kanban/Scrum methodology, it just doesn&#x27;t fit the team, the spirit or the needs.
 What I want is:

                              <span>I have gone through the whole process to setup FIDO for my organization, the last remaining issue is I absolutely cannot get the workstations to display the security key option for authentication. Or any Windows Hello method for auth.
 I&#x27;ve set the GPO, windows deployment package, I even went through the hassle of adding my devices into intune and setting policy and enabling windows hello. I have all the options on the workstation in accounts after logging in, but cannot choose the method for authentication.
 Does anyone have suggestions? The troubleshooting flow in the KBs are quite worthless...

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking at replacing our backup infrastructure with something we can manage a bit easier, ideally with a central management gui for the less technically minded in our organisation.
 We exclusively use Linux, and don&#x27;t touch Windows so Veeam is unfortunately not an option. 
 Is there anything like this out there that can handle sending to S3 directly from each server? Everything I&#x27;ve found seems to be single server and either relies on mounting an S3 bucket as a disk or has no cloud based support at all.

 In the updates screen, it shows &quot;Policies set on your device&quot; as &quot;Disable Automatic Updates&quot;
 Is there something I can check? Based on the event log, the update was installed yesterday sometime, though I can&#x27;t tell if the install was user initiated or not (if user initiated, then this makes sense).
 EDIT: Running wmic qfe list shows the update was installed by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (while I see updates I know were done manually show domain/username). So doesn&#x27;t seem user initiated. 
 How do I stop this behavior? This was running hyper-v workloads, and windows still decided to reboot.

I recently got stuck in a loaner car and have been forced to listen to fm radio for the first time in years and I keep hearing commercials to change careers into IT. Seems like a total scam to me from the commercials so I was wondering if anyone had actually meet someone who moved into the IT field after taking one of those “courses”?

                              <span>Odd query it is IT related in a way as its to do with IT learning and thought a tech here might be doing this already. 
 I am wanting to purchase a number of IT related books to further my development (mastering AD, mastering Powershell, MS100, etc) and thought it&#x27;s going to be cheaper long term to buy in kindle books however my concern is if these type of books have lots of diagrams and need to be in colour?
 Should I just get them as traditional books or is a kindle suitable?

                              <span>Hey team - I am a one man MSP for my small local community. I do simple wifi installs, basic networking, computer set up, etc .. One family I&#x27;m working with has a mother who has dementia. I&#x27;d like to be able to basically provide a tool that controls all ingress and egress emails and/or monitoring of all emails. We&#x27;re looking to solve the scam and spam problems that are especially exacerbated by people who don&#x27;t remember that they don&#x27;t remember things.
 Just looking for anything that is more personally licensed and incredibly easy to use (as I&#x27;d like to give access to the family).

                              <span>If you have several DNS-Servers in your environment with dedicated servers for internet-resolution and internal servers that forward the external queries to them, there should be no outgoing queries except for the internet-DNS systems. Or at least there should be a concept on how queries move through the network.
 Check your config, esp. regarding forwarding config or internal root-NS and then validate on the firewalls if there&#x27;s anything that shouldn&#x27;t be there. 
 We got urgent requests from some customers over the last months where the guys managing DNS got informed (or saw for themselves) that servers contact the internet root-NS that shouldn&#x27;t do that according to the config, and ofc their reaction covered the spectrum from &quot;btw guys, i found that in the firewall, is this normal?&quot; to &quot;OMG, DID WE GET COMPROMISED!? Please do the needful to mitigate and provide turnaround time for resolution!&quot;
 Turns out, the resolver (the OS-component, not a DNS-Server) on some linux systems regularly checks the Root-NS directly for the trust anchors. Not really critical and can be turned off with 2 commands.
 What i found strange is that it has been like that for several years and only a handful of customers was either paranoid, curious or bored enough to actually notice this so far. 
 So yeah...maybe look into that in advance if you have spare time before somethings pops up during an audit on the firewall and it becomes a high-prio issue.

 I have an strange issue since some time the windows network drives of all Windows10 Client PC´s are disconnecting one or two times a day in the branch offices. On my Servers I don´t have this issue. 
 At first I thought it is an network issue but the connection is fine.
 Does anybody has an tip what I could do? (If possible a tip or trick that can be published via GPO, but i am open for all suggestions!)
 ​
 Many thanks in advance!

 If I start our program (as administrator) the software connects to the webdav site and downloads the latest updates
 I need the updates (lot of folders and files) on a ssd but I cannot make a network connection in Windows 10 or use WinSCP to connect to the webdav site. It failes with authentication.. 403 error&gt;
 so.. http anonymous is ok.. with webdav client.. no go? why?
 and unfortunately.. we don&#x27;t know username and pass, the content is managed elsewhere

 How would this work server and network wise? 
 We use UPS with 30 mins power but would this mean everything needs to be switched off daily and manually back on?
 Do you guys have a contingency plan for this?

                              <span>Hi, everyone! Has anyone seen any issues with Windows 11 PCs in a domain environment? Got a handful of PCs that got upgraded to Windows 11 recently. Now they&#x27;re unable to access any file shares at all, get the message:
  
The system cannot contact a domain controller to service the authentication request. Please try again later.
  
Users can manually enter in their AD credentials, but it’s only a temporary solution. Using the IP for network share works without prompting for credentials, though.
 Uninstalled antivirus, reinstalled LAN adapter drivers, also updated them from manufacturer&#x27;s site. Installed all latest Windows updates. Disabled Windows firewall briefly, gave PC full internet access.
 nltest /sc_query:PCLAB.com (fake)
 Returns:
  
Flags: 30 HAS_IP HAS_TIMESERV Authentication Service: Netlogon 
 Trusted DC Name \\PCS1-001.PCLAB.COM 
 Trusted DC Connection Status Status &#x3D; 0 0x0 NERR_Success 
 The command completed successfully
  
​
 nltest /dclist:PCLAB.com
 Returns:
  
Cannot DsBind to PCLAB.COM (\\PCS1-001.PCLAB.COM).Status &#x3D; 2148074320 0x80090350 SEC_E_DOWNGRADE_DETECTED 
 I_NetGetDCList failed: Status &#x3D; 1231 0x4cf ERROR_NETWORK_UNREACHABLE
  
nslookup works without issues. Disabled IPv6 for ethernet connection, manually configured to use different DNS server IPs as well. Even tried &quot;netsh winsock reset&quot; command.
 I can ping our DC &amp; DNS IPs, disjoined/rejoined to domain without issues. Can recreate this on other Windows 11 PCs that were upgraded. Haven&#x27;t tried a completely fresh PC yet, though. This was all done on client PCs so far. Not seeing anything in Event Viewer application/server logs on DC servers.
 I&#x27;m about at the end of my rope and thinking we should just revert these PCs back to Windows 10. I&#x27;d appreciate any helpful advice.

                              <span>Ars Technica had a nice article about how most Big Tech operators just physically destroy media
 https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/why-big-tech-shreds-millions-of-storage-devices-it-could-reuse/?comments&#x3D;1
 They do mention some issues that have happened in the past when companies don&#x27;t wipe/destroy data properly, either cos they outsource it to people/companies that don&#x27;t do it properly or because someone got lazy, leading to fines and or lawsuits.
 I&#x27;ve wiped a few drives in my time working in tech and used them elsewhere in the company with an assurance the data is zeroed out but these have always been for internal use within the company. Looking around a bit I had a hard time finding guidance for a good methodology for erasing/wiping drives. Perhaps I&#x27;m looking for the wrong terms, or looking at the wrong sources.
 How do you guys do it? Any particular sources you trust that keep current with practices?

                              <span>There is a user who works off site behind a double NAT network. They routinely have issues being able to ping our local subnet which means they can&#x27;t get to a server they need. They never have issues establishing the tunnel so I don&#x27;t know why double NAT would come into play. I just noticed the issue while troubleshooting today. It feels more like an issue with their route table on Windows or a corrupted TCP/IP stack? Its weird because they are the only one having this issue as well. Im wondering if the VPN is getting confused, but as far as I know thats only inbound connections.
 Edit: I also want to add that nothing changes with the remote network that I know of and nothing with our local network. Its seemingly random when they can ping the server and when they cant. But, again, never an issue establishing the tunnel.

                              <span>Hello,
 We have 2 Ubiquity switches about 200 feet apart in a warehouse. I would like to run a fiber line between the two. I am planning on using the Ubiquity modules ( UACC-OM-MM-10G-D ) that are designed for MMfiber and 300m run.
 What optical cable should I buy and from where ( link please) ? What tools do I need?
 The warehouse varies from 45F to 110F degrees up by the roof. Can the fiber cable span hanging from hooks on the wall about 10ft spans with out damage?
 Thank you in advance:)

                              <span>I’m trying to understand why I’m encountering very different TCP throughput across similar routes.
  
Client A: Linux, Northern California, in datacenter (1gbps)
 Client B: MacOS, Northern California, residential (500mbps)
 Server A: Virgina, US (1gbps)
 Server B: London, UK (1gbps)
  
Latency is pretty similar between both clients and servers, but TCP throughput is wildly different:
  
  Server A (Virginia) Server B (London) 
  
 Client A 60ms, 400Mbits/sec 136ms, 180Mbits/sec 
  Client B 68ms, 15Mbits/sec 🔴 140ms, 120Mbits/sec 
 
 I uploaded the raw iperf3 output, as well as mtr reports to server a
 I&#x27;m trying to understand why the performance of Client B is so poor to Server A, yet is much better to Server B which is further away.
 What stands out to be from the iperf3 data is:
  
MUCH bigger Cwnd with Client A (6mb vs ~120kb)
 MUCH greater Retr count with Client B
  
Additional info about Client B:
  
Cloudflare speed test shows 550mbps.
 0% packet loss to Server A, reported via &#x60;ping -i 0.1 &#x60; for 60s.
  
​
 Any ideas on what might be happening, or how to debug this?

                              <span>Mods removed my last post because it&#x27;s apparently &quot;h.o.m.e n.e.t.w.o.r.k.i.n.g&quot; (2nd time removed due to using that word alone) when the issue is happening at a customer site that I am trying to assist. Not really sure what difference it makes but anyway: Is there any windows software that can show me more detailed info about my wireless connection? Looking to see bandwidth assigned for a given channel whether its 40 or 80mhz, and to see if its using any QAM modulation technique? I have a 2x2 wifi-5 interface, and assigned the ap to have 80mhz bandwidth on channel 42 (wifiman app says the bandwidth ranges from channels 34 to 50) but am only getting at most 300mbps. I believe it might be possible for this to be higher, if it were using QAM256, but I don&#x27;t know how to check this. There is minimal interference with any overlapping signal at -85dB. I am testing using iPerf3 between my laptop and a server. My network card is an intel ax201, and am connecting to a unifi AC Pro. Thanks!

                              <span>Hello,
 So recently, there has been packet drops on our network in both internal network and external. Whenever we are downloading a file, the speed will gradually slow down and eventually come to 0 kbps then say it has network issues and stop downloading.
 At first, we isolated the issue to be our ISP. And after some testing from them they said that their radio was misaligned causing the packet drops. They fixed the issue on their end. We tested this by just plugging a computer straight into the router and downloading the same file we&#x27;ve been using as a test. There was no issue with downloading.
 So we tested the download on an access switch and on WiFi to see if the issue lies within the internal network. I plugged a laptop straight into the core switch and tested the download. The issue…</span>

Is it possible for the link to work temporarily with SFPs with different wavelengths on each side? It will be DWDM ch 59 and ch 29 temporarily.

                              <span>I understand how it works, and why it&#x27;s important for stopping network loops. What I don&#x27;t really understand is why a link would become unidirectional in the first place, rather than simply stopping. An example I saw was a fibre pair, one for recieving and one for transmitting. However, my understanding is that if a core went down, the link would simply drop.
 Am I missing something more obvious, or is it only for special use cases?

                              <span>For all the Palo experts out there-
 If IPSec VPN tunneling is maintained and encryption algorithms are modified and applied on both sides, will traffic disruptions necessarily occur?
 Will it happen with other firewall vendors like checkpoint,Cisco asa, fortinet, etc as well? Since the working of firewalls are very similar for the most part which is why I asked.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Whats your understanding between normal NAT vs CGNAT? 
 I&#x27;ve worked for small ISPs and all we do is just masquerade list of CGNAT range to a public IP. Example 100.64.0.0/24 to public IP x.x.x.x.
 Whats the difference between the two? How are you configuring CGNAT?
 I came across a comment saying that on CGNAT, we can limit the NAT entries for a user, or even session. I wonder if thats the only difference between the two, whereas normal NAT / masquerade doesnt limit the NAT entries and router will keep on NATting until it ran out of ports.
 When I say normal NAT, in Cisco command: ip nat inside source  pool xyz overload

 So captured some packets turns out it is coming from source port 3842( radius) to destination port 1812, Under application data is was seeing following information:
 Code: access-request Avp-- username:abaws User-password : encrypted
 Framed IP-address: 20.87.27.181 Calling station Id (31) l&#x3D;14 Val &#x3D; 20.87.27.181 ( Microsoft ip! For some reason)
 Acct-session-id &#x3D; 5eb714bb
 Connect-info : VPN-ssl ( very interesting) Vendor I&#x27;d: fortinet (12356)
 Is it normal or does it change for different vendors? Why Microsoft ip is in the captures?

 I have a good networking team with a couple of CCIE&#x27;s and they need some help scanning the market and thinking through a large scale refresh at 200+ locations. We want to modernize and simplify while future-proofing a bit. 
 I know that every VAR, and their great-great-great -grandmother&#x27;s cat, swears they can do it. I&#x27;m not looking for some fancy titles at a var that can interface with major vendors to draw diagrams to give me a BOM - although I will need that eventually. Also not looking for an MSP that can &quot;just do everything for you!&quot;.

                              <span>I am by no means even at a novice level of networking, so I would appreciate if someone can clarify what this address block is intended for. I keep seeing it described as &quot;shared network space&quot; and &quot;not private address space&quot;.
 I just wanted to confirm that this range is indeed not public, and in that sense, similar to a range like 10.0.0.0/8.

                              <span>Hi,
 Stupid question here and Cisco hasn&#x27;t given me a good answer yet. We&#x27;re working on migrating about 2000 access points off a Cisco 8540 to a Cisco 9800. We&#x27;ve been using the CSV tool within the Configuration piece in the GUI and importing static tags with the format , 
, , . After we upload the CSV and point the APs to the 9800, they come up perfectly as designed.
 ​
 As we look to move wider chunks of APs, I want to make sure this work is done in advance of moving the APs. Cisco has said there is no way to dump all this IF the AP is not actively on the controller. This doesn&#x27;t sound right since it&#x27;s stored somewhere in the controller for when the AP does eventually join. Does anyone know of a way via CLI/GUI/API to dump these &quot;staged&quot; static tags?
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>I have a hypervisor which created two bridges xbr-1 and xbr-2, also 10 interfaces on each x-etap-01, etc.
 My goal is to isolate VMs from each other (x-etap-01, x-etap-02, etc) and prohibit access to other devices on the host, just access to Internet, nothing else on the local. 
 One, addition is that these VMs open ports &#x27;port-number&#x27;+id which I need to access from the host, so only one way access to the VMs. 
 Is it possible to do it and is so, I would appreciate directions I should take.
 btw, as you can see, I&#x27;m not good at networking

 What kind of console servers do you use and which ones would you recommend? On the one hand those in small form factor like the airconsole mini but also for rack mounting.

                              <span>Suppose you have a piece of testing equipment with two SFP+ ports and your router/switch has 24 SFP+ ports.
 Do you have any idea to test all switch/router ports at the same time just with two testing ports? I want to ensure that the device can do 240 Gbps switching without any problem.
 My idea is to configure each pair of ports in a separate VLAN and connect each VLAN to the next VLAN by connecting one port of the VLAN&#x27;s pair to one of the ports on the next VLAN. The first port and last port of the device are connected to the testing ports.

                              <span>Two devices on the same wifi network can have the same public IP address. So when the router receives a packet, it has to translate the destination public IP address to the private IP of the intended device. This means NAT can only use the port numbers to identify a device on a local network, as well as which port of that device to send the packet to.
 Does this practice reduce the number of available ports that all of the devices combined can use at a time? Because each device can have a maximum of 65,536 ports and for multiple devices, the total number of ports increases with each new device, but the router can support a maximum of 65,536 ports itself.

                              <span>I got called into a project to install a wireless Point to Point between two buildings at a client. The buildings have fiber, but they want a redundant link to avoid downtime. Apparently there&#x27;s some upcoming construction and the boss is worried the fiber may get accidentally get cut in construction. 
 I&#x27;ve installed the Ubiquiti Power beam on each building and connected each end to a Cisco switch. I am using the PoE injectors. 
 In the testing phase, the PtP is working fine. The warehouse end comes out of a trunk port on the Cisco Switch, go through a PoE injector, then wireless goes across the parking lot to the admin building and then comes through another PoE injector. 
 If you plug a laptop straight to the injector, it joins you to the LAN. If you put an unmanaged switch on the injector, and then plug in, you&#x27;re on the LAN. 
 But if you run the injector into the second switch, it doesn&#x27;t go anywhere. The CLI doesn&#x27;t even show the port (port 2) as active. 
 What am I missing? I have full access to the switches, but I don&#x27;t really have a good background of Cisco Training.
 Ideally, I&#x27;d like both links to be active, so if the fiber broke, the PtP would keep everything online, and I believe STP would prevent a loop, if activated. 
 If all else fails, it&#x27;s fine if the PtP stays unplugged from the switch until actually needed. 
 I&#x27;ve tested it both with the fiber plugged and unplugged, and it does not make a difference.

It seems the only way to stop this is to make sure more IT admins are aware of their reporting requirements in regulated industry or nonregulated areas make sure they a transparent procedure for notifying customers. 
 It seems companies and tech vendors are being attacked with increased sophistication and they are covering up or downplaying security breaches with hippo sized lies with increased frequency. Its an open secret amongst IT admins and security professionals but definitely one of the ugliest things we have to deal with. I am currently in the midst of a very nasty Hospital provider client separation because they have been trying to avoid reporting a HIPAA breach with numerous e…</span>

                              <span>I need to replace an aging QNAP NAS. The file system has grown, currently growing over 1TB / yr. The NAS has 18TB of space and using 14TB. It had a Gigabit network which would be a disaster to restore. 
 I have an offsite backup server running freenas on a Supermicro 36 bay chassis. I love the snapshotting of ZFS and its ability for differential offsite snapshots but not sure I want to use Supermicro for my production system as there is not a lot of part’s available in Canada. I’d prefer Dell, but then I’d need to go with a storage array attached to a server which isn’t as simple for shutting down power as a 36 bay chassis. Or I could get a new rack mount NAS from QNAP or Synology with a 10Gbe NIC but then I don’t get ZFS and am stuck with the NAS OS which isn’t the end of the world.

 Been a long time lurker on this subreddit and figured I&#x27;d create a post to get some help with challenges that myself and the rest of my teammates are experiencing. Was hoping that others out there might have some experience with lab management and can recommend some best practices to implement (tools, processes, technologies, anything really that could improve our lab environment).
 My team wants to make improvements in the lab and we are frequently asked by management what we would need to make it happen. Unfortunately, everyone currently working in the lab has really only experienced this lab environment and aren&#x27;t aware of other technologies or improvements that could be made to run things a little more efficiently.
 First, let me paint a vivid picture of our current lab …</span>

 It&#x27;s entirely possible I&#x27;m just too damn old and don&#x27;t keep up with what the cool kids are calling things.
 Here&#x27;s the context (from my sister):
  
One of our systems keeps throwing out an internal server error and to fix it, IT said they &quot;rippled the servers&quot;
  
That sounds like rolling reboots of a server cluster/farm? Maybe?

                              <span>Howdy fellow sysadmins! I do some pro-bono consultation work for a small company (15 employees). They don&#x27;t have significant financial resources, but they&#x27;re cresting the amount of &quot;random&quot; systems that I can support without some management capability. 
 Setting up an entire active directory domain is extremely cost-prohibitive for them, so I&#x27;m looking for solutions. They already have a new Synology NAS, and it appears that Synology&#x27;s offering for their Directory Server is pretty alright for what I think I need.
 I&#x27;m looking for a way to standardize accounts &amp; permissions across their workstations, as well as a way to push group policies to the machines. It looks on the surface that all of this is supported. 
 They currently use a paid Google service for all their email, etc. but I&#x27;ve also thought of Microsoft 365 for them if the juice is worth the squeeze. From what I&#x27;ve been reading, they&#x27;d be paying the same price, but I would get all the added benefit of AD features (not all, but the critical ones).
 So, my question is this... 
  
Does anyone here have any experience using Synology&#x27;s DS offering?
 
What are you using for secondary DNS? I know the primary DNS is recommended to be run on the Synology along with the DS. 
 Currently DNS is on their pfsense, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind turning that into the secondary if it would support all the weird things needed for DS to work correctly.
 
 Has anyone use the Microsoft 365 offering? Is that worth checking out? How does it handle Group Policy, etc.
  
I&#x27;m sure this conversation will evolve, but I&#x27;d love to hear folks impressions.
 Full disclosure: For my background, I spent 10 years as a Windows System admin from 2000-2010 and am very comfortable in that environment. I then switched careers into Cyber and now focus on OT, so I&#x27;ve been Linux focused for the last 12 or so. Extremely comfortable in both environments and have been running Linux workstations and servers for 20 years.

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious to hear about others solutions for managing assets aside from the standard laptop and cell phone. I&#x27;m talking about printers, monitors, docking stations and any other semi-expensive tech one might deploy. Do you simply slap some type of asset tag on those device? I know there is countless asset management systems, but what about the smaller businesses? Typically, they are understaffed in IT as it is, and hardly pay for the necessities let alone an asset management system. I know there are free options out there, but I can&#x27;t vouch for helpful those might be. Aside from that, we still have to rely on other people to physically return or ship these devices back, at least this is the case in my role. That&#x27;s the part I hate, depending on someone else to do their job. How the hell do you make sure so and so returns all the equipment they should have in possession at the end of their employment? I mean printers and monitors don&#x27;t exactly go back into their boxes nice and neatly if they still even have them. I sure as hell can&#x27;t depend on an end user to pack things up nice and safely. What about disgruntled terminated employees? They obviously are bitter and are less cooperative. Do you have to get company council involved for them? 
 I know this turned more into a rant as I went on. I just am tired of that sense of searching for needles in a haystack and pulling teeth trying to keep up with tracking tech all over the county.

                              <span>Hey all,
 I’m trying to navigate the world of ruggedized laptops. At the moment my company continues to deploy refurbished Panasonic tough books, and while they’ve been somewhat reliable the fact is that most of these devices are 9 to 11 years old. Even replacing the HDD for a SSD is starting to become problematic as other components of these devices are continuing to fail. Third generation i5’s that have been heavily used aren’t having much fun anymore and I’m not having much fun supporting them at this point. 
 If you currently deploy laptops of these nature, then what is your go to? I know we’re currently paying ~$800 a piece for these older CF-53 laptops from a private refurbisher. There’s been discussion about going back to “standard” laptops for these guys as they aren’t exactly roughing it in the backwoods but I want to present a more current option for a rugged device if possible. Please note that I know they would be perfectly okay with refurbished devices if that isn’t obvious enough.

                              <span>My company got hit with the bad Bitdefender update today that interrupted our internet browsing. I was wondering what steps people took today to figure out the issue? I switched to our backup internet connection which didn&#x27;t help, ran a tracert and saw that it was hanging on the second hop, then checked downdetector and saw that whatever the issue was, it hit google, aws, and azure. I didn&#x27;t find out what the issue was until I hopped on reddit after the problem resolved itself. What did you do to troubleshoot the issue?

                              <span>I am just so damn tired of my mail queue filling up with bogus &quot;Geek Squad&quot; invoices. I get very little spam because of fairly aggressive filtering + SpamAssassin on my server. The only things that seem to get through are the damn spams from GMail addresses.
 This last one was for a &quot;Greek Sqaud&quot; renewal that was an image with no text other than &quot;HELLO USER&quot;. Complaints fall into a black hole, but they&#x27;re never from the same address twice, so even if Google did block the user, they&#x27;re just back using ImaDickweed298 instead of ImaDickweed297.
 There are only a handful of domains that I can&#x27;t consider putting a blanket ban on, and they&#x27;re one.

                              <span>We have a email filter to block/quarantine all the obvious spam &amp; malicious intent emails but curious what everybody else does for spoofed emails? So, the sender is using Gmail for example but lists their name as someone in the company usually an exec&#x27;s name or as a service such as &quot;IT Admin&quot;. 
 Right now I prepend the emails Subject line with &quot;**** WARNING ****&quot; and also include a large yellow box in the message body that says in so many words Caution, External Sender , Fake, Stranger Danger, etc. 
 I understand how a person might breeze past the subject line but the yellow box cannot be missed. At least that&#x27;s what I thought. I still get folks contacting me asking if emails are legit or not. Their email includes the two prepended warnings but they are still unsure. I am happy everyone is being safe but I thought the warnings make it obvious.
 Again, curious what other people&#x27;s strategies are for spoofed emails and warning the user base.
 (I would prefer to block them outright but, numerous Execs use personal gmail, yahoo, outlook etc. to email themselves)

                              <span>Hello everyone. Just had users complaining that &quot;the internet is down&quot;. Usually, I may roll my eyes and then get over myself but this time it was network wide. Rebooted switch stack, checked FW, no change/apparent issues. 20 minutes later everything seems ok, checked downdetector. Sure enough a spike in reports for Google, OpenDNS, AWS, and CloudFlare.
 ​
 Has anyone else had issues as of ~12PM EST?

                              <span>Currently analyzing the implementation of Windows Update using Intune Quality Update Ring and I came accross a showstopper.
 March 9th 2021 Update (printing BSOD)
 March 15th 2021 Out-of-band Fix
 If I delay the update by 7 days, does the OOB get delayed as well? How can I manage something like this?

                              <span>So I finally have a rant to put forth here...
 Anyone that charges for SSO on their platform is pure BS. We have &quot;Cadillac services&quot; that support it out of the box with no additional &quot;enterprise&quot; licensing scheme. We have products that aren&#x27;t &quot;tier 1&quot; ranked that support it out of the box.
 And hell we even have Oracle products that support it out of the box... (I mean these are the guys with &quot;If you choose to have a firewall in your organization.&quot; in their documentation)
 In my odyssey to centralize authentication these companies have now made the shit list... And the ones that got the balls to charge per user per month... (Keep in mind these aren&#x27;t the SP)
 Notably you Atlassian, Docusign, teamviewer.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I have a issue that i can’t seem to solve:
 I have a WDS server running, make boot images and install images. Now i want them to run unattended, i made a answer file and attached it to my test image. But when i PXE boot and select my boot image there is no sign that i uses the unattended file and makes me go through the full setup.
 What could be the issue?
 It should just connect to the server, sign in and run through the setup by itself.
 It seems that the boot image is not using the unattended file.
 Thanks in advance for any help given 😊

Multiple Users, Multiple Cell Carriers (canada - we thought it was a roaming data issue at first). All got refused this morning, but their laptops and logging in online works fine. 
 Also removed account from mail, it let us re-add but then appeared to sync nothing. 
 Installing Outlook app works.

 I know MDT/WDS can handle this but I am looking for other options that might be quicker to set up and use. Any thoughts or recommendations?

 When was this changed? Did I miss the announcement or was this silently changed? Why was it changed?

                              <span>So let me start off by saying that I recently started a new job, where I&#x27;m trying to implement MDT for imaging. I came from a position where I was using SCCM for imaging, so I&#x27;m familiar with Task Sequences, but I&#x27;m familiar with SCCM TS, which are a bit different from the MDT. (SCCM provides more options in the TS - More steps that aren&#x27;t available in vanilla MDT)
 That being said, I&#x27;ve got my TS to install the Operating System, but it won&#x27;t install applications. If I try to install applications without rebooting, it says that it can&#x27;t install applications from WinPE, so it&#x27;s going to reboot. Then it reboots and never finishes the TS.
 From doing some Google searching, it seems that it&#x27;s the WinRE that performs this step. However, I can&#x27;t get my TS to boot into WinRE to do that step. When I do the reboot step, it reboots into the main Windows OS, and just finishes the windows setup. The steps after that reboot never run. What am I doing wrong? How can I get it to reboot and still finish the task sequence?

                              <span>Seems multiple businesses, schools, etc, have been hit with ransomware near us lately. Each one I&#x27;ve heard of, their vm&#x27;s got encrypted along with backups. Some, their network was taken down completely as well. I&#x27;ve seen some quick dirty lists of controls to implement for this but damn it stresses me out because some of those with seemingly everything in place, still get hit. The fact that I would be at the office 24/7 rebuilding basically everything if that were to happen. Even if you have backups that don&#x27;t get hit, restoring everything and making sure its clean would be a nightmare in itself.
 It&#x27;s literally the only &quot;stressor&quot; in my role, wondering if/when you&#x27;ll get hit and what that will be like... How do you push that out of your mind?

                              <span>Facilities keeps contacting IT about trouble alarms going off multiple times in a day with no fire alarm actually going off. This is happening in many locations across campus but I am able to put a tone on the line and receive it at the opposite end. 
 I am under the impression that if I get a tone, the line is working as intended. Could there still be an issue that IT could fix even if I am getting my tone to traverse the whole line? These lines have been underground for about 50 years now so I am assuming it is normal wear and tear issues but I have to meet with the head of facilities to explain that to him and I&#x27;m not sure how to put it.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I’ve been given a task to find suitable governance tools for MS Teams, that can enforce some simple governance tools across a few thousand teams.
 The basics: - we want to see orphaned Teams and be able to quickly delete them
  
we want to force all current and future Teams to have at least 2 owners (so the specific departments themselves prevent orphaning their teams)
  
Does anyone know of a tool like that? We’re a very cybersecurity-minded org, with all our eggs in the MS basket, so we definitely need it securely integrate with MS.
 What solutions are you guys using? Do you think it would be better to just enforce it with PowerShell and angry emails?

                              <span>Updated my admin PC to 22H2 yesterday. Everything went mostly fine after I stopped trying to use Windows update to do the update. When the machine boots up I am greeted by a &quot;Program Compatibility assistant&quot; warning saying that the driver iqvw64e.sys is vulnerable and that it cannot load.
 I looked it up and that looks like this bug: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00051.html
 So I went and installed this:
 https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/15084/intel-ethernet-adapter-complete-driver-pack.html
 And when I reboot it is still telling me that the file is vulnerable.
 I noticed that when I installed the update from Intel the driver never changed at all, there are 4 copies of it on this system and they are all this file:
 05/22/2019 02:57 AM 58,304 iqvw64e.sys
 Is anyone aware if it is possible to correct this?

 Today, as I was going through yet another job interview I stumbled on this one recruiter who seemed like he had no interest in partaking this interview. The interview was done through Teams, and throughout the entire time he seemed like he was wandering off, focused on something else, picking his teeth. The entire interview took 5 minutes exactly.
 It started off with him asking me about my background, which I provided and quickly moved to the so called &quot;technical questions&quot;. Naturally, as with all tests, I get extremely nervous and mentally prepare to go into as much as detail as I can.

 ​
 i´ve got some kind of bug here. Maybe brainbug but we will see...
 I´ve got an nps that is also running dom CA. MsChapv2 is working as expected for vpn connections. All connections are logged. (failed and accepted)
 I will have to add another Policy for 802.1x wifi. If I disable PEAP as auth source and instead configure MsChap or anything else, I will have log entries with an unsupported auth. method. If I enable PEAP with any cert (Client/Server/IAS RAS) there are no eventlogs for this policy. The wifi itself will timeout on the radius request. BUT i have eventlogs in my C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\INxxxx.log no error:

                              <span>I want to set up ACS TR-069 server for TP-Link routers (mostrly) and seeing that their AgileSolution doesn&#x27;t work properly on Europe becuase of old Agile 1.1 verison with limited options, i want to set up my own ACS server.
 I didn&#x27;t go too deep and found GenieACS as a free open-source option.
 Does anyone have experience using it and know if it&#x27;s good or there are any other options?
 I see that the software has regular updates, i will set up a VM and try test with some routers before deploy to end-users...

                              <span>Hello, I have 10 employees who have Linux (opensuse) and they all want to work with Office 365 desktop apps. What&#x27;s the best way to do this?
 We have tried: 
  
Openoffice apps for linux (none of them are good enough)
 
Office 365 in browser (not good enough)
 
A VM for each user with Office 365 installed (abandoned because of extreme resource use)
 
An RDS server with Office 365 (haven&#x27;t tried, but apparently is very resource expensive as well)

                              <span>Hi all
 What kind of shelving/cabinets/storage set up do you have for your spare parts in the data center? I have a few Bakers shelves and some miscellaneous totes. However, it has now ended up where I have stuff laying around all over the place on the floor in different cages because there’s not enough shelving and no real system. 
 Wondering what you all do, and if you’d be willing to share some pictures of your set up. I would really like to do better.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I’m looking for a platform that will update the warranty status of our endpoints (we use major manufacturers like MS, Dell, Lenovo, and Apple). We currently use Solarwinds Service Desk, which is fine, but won’t give us warranty information unless that info is already on the device, so it’s hit or miss. I’m looking for something that will pull the warranty status from the manufacturer for the most up to date information.
 Please let me know if you have any recommendations, thank you!

                              <span>I’m a catch-all IT manager and the latest thing to fall on my lap is joining an international office to our UK-based domain. We have a handful of staff abroad and we want to get their computers fully corporate/policy/etc.
 I don’t know where to begin as networking is my least strongest subject within my many, many hats.
 Right now those in the international office will VPN in to access network resources. But this is just like “working from home”.
 What I want is a second AD DS server over there which will act as a backup DC and allow “local” authentication, etc. Corporate laptops will therefore always be domain joined.
 Where do I begin?
 My research says something like purchasing: a router/firewall, a switch, a windows server, then the various cabling/infrastructure and probably an Aruba Instant-on AP for wireless.
 Do I configure the windows server to VPN on over to our domain? 
 I’m getting a flight over and buying a Netgate 4100 running Pfsense. Do I configure the VPN there?
 I appreciate this is a big question and a big can of worms, and I can see why people might suggest employing a 3rd party network specialist to sort it over there, but I reckon getting over the domain join hurdle and setting up the firewall are the 2 only obstacles I have.
 Any thoughts greatly appreciated – thanks from an overworked, overhatted, accidental sysadmin.

 Confused as tried logging in on a device that is enrolled into intune and in the Edge browser signed in but still won&#x27;t let me in? Surely this should work as enrolled?
 Just wondering how to get back in without contacting MS. I have a few devices enrolled but none let the admin login.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m using these 2 commands to copy data from an old file server to a new one.
 First: (copies all and the permissions)
 ROBOCOPY &quot;\\oldserver\folder1&quot; &quot;G:\folder1&quot; /E /ZB /XD DfsrPrivate /PURGE /COPYALL /R:0 /NP /tee 
 Second: (hopefully just changes)
 ROBOCOPY &quot;\\oldserver\folder1&quot; &quot;G:\newserver&quot; /mir /R:0 /np 
 The second 1 can take just as long to run/finish. The folder is about 1TB.
 Is that about normal in terms of time. Bother servers are VMs on the same 10GB network. CPU/Mem all seem low too.

                              <span>We are having a slight issue when trying to detect new doors/ACUs in our Net2 server config.
 We have a Net2 server/setup located in one office and a number of doors/ACUs connected to it locally, but we are now in the process of setting 5 doors/ACUs in a remote office – we have the network configuration in place and from the server that is hosting our Net2 server I can ping the remote office ACUs by the IP addresses they have been assigned (this only proves ICMP but I all add more on)
 The issue I note is that when I try to detect doors with the detect button I am not seeing any new doors appear in the list, however if I try to manually add one of the ACUs/Doors by MAC it lets me but when entering the IP it gives me an error/status that the IP is already in use by a device with the same MAC address
 I am not sure what exactly could be the issue here but I have noted it does get added into the Net2 Access Control tool so we can somewhat configure and use it.
 The issue is that it is not working fully as expected with the error/notice above, is there anything major we could be missing?
 To me it looks like the door is being seen by our server but not detected correctly.
 Anyone has experience with this?

                              <span>Long story short, I changed jobs few months ago. For documentation I left following 1) Actual documentation and password for everything 2) Video training how to do specific stuff, mostly how to keep infrastructure running, intended for even non technical person to do stuff.
 Now here&#x27;s the fun part, New guy comes around and starts blaming me for stuff, by stuff I mean everything Some DHCP/DNS issue arose and he started manually setting static IP for users which caused issues itself, He doesn&#x27;t have any experience with Unix so logs in as root to the critical server and he accidentally deletes cron jobs He doesn&#x27;t have any experience with AD and randomly messes with stuff which causes issues and other stuff I won&#x27;t mention ALL of this gets blamed on me and with reason - &quot;He didn&#x27;t left enough info&quot;
 He doesn&#x27;t message me directly to ask for stuff(He only messages when he can&#x27;t fix something and wants help which I am no longer providing) During office working hours whenever something breaks and he can&#x27;t fix it - Old guys fault, no idea what to do.
 now normally I wouldn&#x27;t care, but I have tons of non technical colleagues there and it&#x27;s my reputation on line, should I get in touch with ex boss and inform him about this stuff?

 I&#x27;ve been using AD and Servers for a good few years however I don&#x27;t know all the basics &amp; best practises that I probably should.

                              <span>Hello! 
 Maybe someone here can give me some new ideas...
 We have 14 devices (mostly Dell laptops, different models, and one Surface Pro) with this issue. The screen locks after 5 min regardless of power/screensaver settings.
 Some devices are running win10 others win11.
 Troubleshooting steps tried:
 - Restore power settings to default
 - Assign a different power plan
 - Modified screensaver settings or disable screensaver
 - Local Policies &gt; Security Options &gt; “Interactive Logon: Machine inactivity limit” set it to 900 seconds or more...
 - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power\PowerSettings\238C9FA8-0AAD-41ED-83F4-97BE242C8F20\7bc4a2f9-d8fc-4469-b07b-33eb785aaca0 -&gt; set attributes to 2 and then modify system unattended sleep timeout option to 30 min or whatever number above 5.
 - Checked dell optimizer proximity sensor 
 - Run power troubleshooter
 - Uninstall recent windows updates
 - All Dell updates for device are done
 Any other ideas?

 Hi, i noticed the application you installed has a login page on a webserver that&#x27;s not in https. I can provide you with the necessary certificates from our Enterprise CA.
 Vendor:
 I&#x27;m sorry, current version of our web interface does not support https. Why do you need https? It&#x27;s an internal network, not the internet.

                              <span>I currently have a server with a ryzen 3800x, 64gb ram and 30TB of Raid-z1 HDD storage. I looked into creating a VPS company (https://zermous.com), however with further research I could have to pay lots of money for a colocation to support allocating external IPV4 addresses. I am able to now via routing wireguard from other VPS to the one I create, however I cannot automate this, even with programs such as ansible. I was also looking into cloud storage solutions, however there really isn&#x27;t any pre-made solutions. 
 I don&#x27;t have the time nor money to be constantly working on this project due to university and my job so I was hoping there was another solution to make some money off this because I don&#x27;t personally need it.
 Thank you for any answers/replies.
 TLDR; 
 I have a server that I don&#x27;t know what to do with.

At my current $job we have multiple VLANs for various systems, the basic network is CLIENT (untagged) --&gt; Cisco Phone (Tagged) --&gt; Meraki/Netgear Switch --&gt; Cisco Nexus --&gt; Router (VyOS) --&gt; HyperFlex + Vmware --&gt; Windows Server 2019 with DHCP (in fail over) + MDT Server.
 The VyOS router has DHCP relay listeners on all the client networks to route them to the Windows servers for DHCP (or MDT).
 Now the issue is VLAN 1 (as the default) is only used for network management, everything else is on their own VLANs.
 100 - VoIP / 200-202 - Client / 300 - Servers
 So the issue is, some PCs (Dell desktops) or laptops (Dell Laptop + Dock OR Lenovo Laptop + Dock) picks up a DHCP offer from the wrong network. Some times it could be on the old client VLAN or currently it&#x27;s attempting to bind to VLAN 1&#x27;s range.
 Most of the PCs, if we get Windows (10 or 11) to do a network reset (or manually do netsh winsock reset &amp; netsh ip int reset), the system comes good.
 Notes
  
Statically setting the IP address, allows the computer to work on the correct VLAN
 The computer gets the IP but fails to release OR communicate with anything (IE if it&#x27;s on the wrong VLAN)
 All the DHCP is running from 2 servers in a failover configuration under M$ on Windows
 The computers are either freshly built or been running for about 3-9 months
 Everything is updated to the latest versions (as per M$ for Windows, Dell/Lenovo for drivers, Cisco/Netgear for switches, VyOS for router)
 Each port is configured for the native VLAN to be the correct client VLAN + the VoIP VLAN being tagged for the phones.

 I know it doing a DB clean up but is it normal to see DNS update Failed (Error 31) (DNSRegError 2) for each IP before it attempts to renew ??

                              <span>So I&#x27;m helping to rewrite our job descriptiona. We&#x27;re a small shop with three guys (sysadmin, help desk/desktop, me/dev). The current sysadmin is leaving but had done a lot of security functions as well. Is there a generally acceptable title for a combined role like this? I know the general answer would be to have them separate but we don&#x27;t have enough going on for two positions where now we have one. I do part of the sysadmin work as well as part of my functions so... Yay?

                              <span>Recently we&#x27;ve been increasing security on some of our important domain accounts, mainly privileged dev &amp; sysadmin users. Adding them to the Protected Users group was one of those measures.
 Ever since, we&#x27;re not able to authenticate to our SQL Server using these accounts, neither using Windows Authentication nor SQL Server Authentication. Removing the protected users group completely removes the problem. We&#x27;re aware this is due to the data not being stored in the local cache which is used in the authentication process.
 I wonder if there are workarounds, or if there&#x27;s similar security features which would not break our authentication.

                              <span>I have two c9300&#x27;s, one plugged into AC power, the other I am trying to run it via its stack power cable connected to the first. It won&#x27;t power on, the cable is seated properly, and ive tried other cables. 
 I&#x27;ve got it exactly the same way two other c9300&#x27;s are connected, and booted. 
 What would cause this not to power up?
 Thanks.

                              <span>I’m trying to implement MAB on a server farm switch. I did a show mac address-table and got the list of MAC addresses that were listed on all the ports, I then fed them into the MAB policy in ISE and successfully was able to MAB the hyper v port but almost all the ports went down and didn’t come back up once I applied MAB and bounced the port and one of them the minute I added the port that was the physical host in the server it went down and would not come back up until I removed all the authentication and tagged it directly into the vlan again with a “switchport access vlan xxx”command. In the end 99% of the ports either wouldn’t come up the minute I applied MAB to the port or went down when I applied MAB to some other port. I can’t imagine it’s not possible to MAB virtual servers and I must just be missing something. 
 Any advice would be appreciated

                              <span>I have a cluster of of 5 nodes which are all a part of a LAN. I want to run my client on a VM (ubuntu 20.04) on one of these devices and server directly on another physical machine.
 I am planning to use soft-roce on my VM. I want to use RoCE version 2 on my physical server. 
 Q. is this possible with ibverbs API ?
 Q. is this possible to use V2 of RoCE without using the mellanox ofed driver on the physical server? as ethernet and ROCE can&#x27;t co-exist on the same server and I still want my LAN to be up on my cluster, but just use RoCE for my client-server application.
 Any help would be appreciated, as I&#x27;m a bit stuck, thank you so much!

                              <span>I&#x27;m not entirely understanding what the best practice is for managing VLANs, subnets, and broadcast domains is when designing an enterprise LAN. 
 Here&#x27;s a basic LAN segment to reference throughout this post.
 Across an organization, let&#x27;s assume that at that a small size site with a single switch has VLAN 69 specified for interfaces connecting to PCs. 
 At a larger site, there will be multiple switches connecting to a central core switch (or switch cluster), which then connected upstream to a router (router-on-a-stick). If I deploy VLAN 69 on both of the access switches, despite them being in different subnets, the trunk links connecting the access switches to the core switch will expand my broadcast domain to include both of these networks. The L3 traffic will be contained to whatever the mask is set to (in this case, the two /24s as shown in the diagram), but the L2 traffic will include all three switches and the LAN-facing router interface. 
 Q: Is it possible to keep the broadcast domain limited to the scope of only the respective /24 networks without having to specify two separate VLAN IDs, or do I have to make one of the switches operate on a different VLAN ID? 
 If separate VLAN IDs are required, how do you best design your VLAN deployments? Do you have ranges of VLAN IDs for specific purposes (i.e. VLAN 60-69 for PCs, VLAN 70-79 for Servers, etc.)?

 Does anyone know what the comparison would be for Nokia&#x27;s NOKIA 7250 IXR-E in a VSR enviroment and the equivalent of the HUAWEI CX600-M2K as a virtual router? I have a client that wants the capabilities of those devices but on the software version. Any leads on dealers?
 TIA.

                              <span>I have a lecture hall with six Cisco 3602 APs. I counted 115 clients during today&#x27;s class session with 90% of them on the 5GHz band. The students and professor are complaining about the wifi. 
 The distribution of clients heavily favors 2 APs. One 5Ghz radio had 35; the other had 30. Other APs in the area had 0-10 clients. I have tried adjusting the power levels and will do further tests to try to determine why so many APs are favoring 1-2 5GHz radios when there are 4+ more to choose from in the immediate area. 
 This lecture hall has tables for each row so the clients aren&#x27;t as densely packed as you&#x27;re imagining and the APs are evenly distributed overhead. The only way to fit ~100 people in this room is to have an even distribution of bodies in seats. I think that rules out favoring 1-2 radios based on proximity. But I&#x27;m no expert
 Load balancing is not enabled on the controller. Does anyone have experience with this feature? I can&#x27;t find much information on it aside from Cisco saying it will totally work. 
 We do have band-select enabled and that appears to be working. The controller is a 5508 running 8.5.171.0

 So where does an MPLS circuit plug into, just a regular ATT modem and to the velocloud? Or is there something I&#x27;m not understanding. I&#x27;ve heard a MPLS circuit is virtual? Can someone clear up this concept for me on how the physical connections are.

 Looking on amazon at stuff like this:
 https://www.amazon.co.uk/SGILE-Network-Computer-Maintenance-Stripper/dp/B06X1BKFY9/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?crid&#x3D;S8O0ZBVFGF6Y&amp;keywords&#x3D;network%2Btool%2Bkit&amp;qid&#x3D;1665076310&amp;qu&#x3D;eyJxc2MiOiI0LjYwIiwicXNhIjoiNC4xNSIsInFzcCI6IjMuOTYifQ%3D%3D&amp;s&#x3D;diy&amp;sprefix&#x3D;network%2Btool%2Bki%2Cdiy%2C55&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;th&#x3D;1
 Or screwfix at something a bit more pricey:
 https://www.screwfix.com/p/lan-installation-tool-kit-55-pieces/66910#product_additional_details_container
 What is the difference between these? I imagine the crimpers are much better quality, just wanted some advice, I&#x27;m not really a network engineer just have to dabble now and then,
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey there,
 We have a client that was having slow download speeds while on the Global VPN client. I did some digging and found an article that describes a technology called Receive Segment Coalescing which from what I could gather is used to offload processing to NIC of the machine. They stated that Microsoft recommended disabling this feature so I gave a try with the client. Sure enough it worked like a charm but I&#x27;m trying to understand why this fixed the issue. Maybe I have to do some more digging but was curious if anyone on here happen to know anything about this.

                              <span>Hey everyone, looking for some advice.
 We are moving to a new 9500sq. ft. heavy equipment shop (aprox. 12 bays).
 basic info:
 -ISP will be starlink (remote location)
 -5-15 admin users doing only ERP + google suite(email, drive)
 -big empty warehouse, 115x85ft, 24ft tall. Only obstructions would be actual steel columns and equipment sitting there
 -small 9x20ft drywall office in the middle
 -remote location means IT support will be mostly remote
 -EDIT, forgot to add, 6-10 poe security cameras.
 ​
 Project needs:
 We need a good wifi coverage in the entire warehouse, use will be on the light side. Initially I wanted to avoid running utp cables in my service racks (oil, air, etc) so I wanted to explore a mesh solution that would only require a central node with data plus 4-6 antennas connected to power outlets. Is there a commercial/enterprise mesh wifi that you guys would recommend or instead invest in a switch, running utp cables, and APs?

I&#x27;ve been stuck in IVR loops for the past 3 days trying to open a ticket on a DIA circuit with NO luck at all. Has anyone been able to track down a direct number to any form of an enterprise product NOC?
 Thanks!

                              <span>EDIT: When you have a duplicate address problem, it&#x27;s probably because you set things up incorrectly so that there is a duplicate IP on the network. 
 Our order is still trickling in, but I got a few devices so I figured I&#x27;d set up a Switch and AP so I can start getting our RADIUS / Eduroam / WPN set up on the AP. 
 Plugged the Meraki into the Cisco 2960S with both sides on a Trunk port. 
 Am able to use multiple VLans on the Meraki. Can see the internet, can ping other VLans. Routing is working fine, DHCP to a new test Server is working fine, and DNS is working fine. 
 The issue is that on the core switch we&#x27;re getting that error %IP-4-DUPADDR: Duplicate address which is seeing the downlink interface MAC as assigned to the Gateway IP for the Meraki Management VLan, but that Gateway IP is also assigned to the SVI on the Core Switch (Cisco 4500x). 
 You can easily see this by either pinging outside from the Windows Server (Google DNS is the main test IP), but it&#x27;s the same from the Windows Server to the 4500x (Pure Storage -&gt; Nexus -&gt; 4500x). But pinging from the 4500x to the ASA it fails not at all. 
 I believe that by removing BDPU Guard on the 2960S downlink interface so I could attach the Meraki I should also enable Root Guard on the Meraki to allow BDPU frames to flow down and to not have the Meraki think the uplink interface is the root bridge in its little STP brain. 
 Any assistance would be appreciated.

                              <span>Our company monitors and supports basic networks throughout the country. What I mean by that is usually all we are monitoring is the Carriers Gateway, Our firewall/gateway, Our Switching and the wireless access points.
 For the last 8 years we were using the .exe version of Mikrotik&#x27;s The Dude for monitoring. But it really is becoming unusable. We constantly rebuilding it after the database corrupts. 
 We have tested Zabbix and Open NMS but we really don&#x27;t have the resources to self host and maintain. We are considering Open NMS Meridian at this time but was wondering if anyone has any suggestions. It does not need to be free or open source. It also cannot require a PC or some type of equipment onsite to run an agent. 
 The Dude was very simple to use with its ability to build the maps, add separate sites, add notes and add objects. We have not really found anything exactly the same. Anyone know of anything similar? We also use ConnectWise Manage. Integration would be nice but not necessary.

 I didn&#x27;t go too deep and found GenieACS as a free open-source option.
 Does anyone have experience using it and know if it&#x27;s good or there are any other options?
 I see that the software has regular updates, i will set up a VM and try test with some routers before deploy to end-users...

                              <span>Hi. I obtained a used HP 1920s from the working environment (at least they told me so) but when I try to access the web interface to configure it, I simply can&#x27;t get into it. I have another switch that is my DHCP, when I connected the 1920s to that switch with the patch cord, the 1920s doesn&#x27;t get any IP address at all. I don&#x27;t see this in the log. I found that the default IP for HP 1920s switche is 192.168.1.1 My main switch is also configured for this IP. Ok, I tried to connect directly to the laptop. I have configured IPv4 on the Windows machine to be IP - 192.168.1.10 Mask default 255.25.255.0. The switch is not accessible on 192.168.1. And I can see it&#x27;s connected with 100MB but should be 1G. Does it mean the switch is dead? Or I am doing something wrong? Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m doing some research with vrfs and routing, and I&#x27;m trying to get my head around the way host can interact with multiple routing tables.
 I have N (e.g. 2) vrfs with associated routing tables. For simplicity, let&#x27;s call it as usual, red/blue. Each of vrfs has veth interface linking into depth of Openstack, (but it&#x27;s not important). red should have route to 10.0.1.0/24 via veth_red and blue should have route to 10.0.2.0/24 via veth_blue.
 I also has 10.0.3.0/24 on the dummy0 on host.
 I want to make both 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/14 to be reachable from dummy0. And I can&#x27;t undestand what route and where should I put.
 I need to put route to blue vrf for 10.0.1.0/24 (and corresponding red). But how should I force host to look into those tables?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking into ingress load balancing on the side and was wondering how other might have handled this and what the network architecture looks like. 
 I know seesaw and nginx (and HAp and Trae) but there&#x27;s surprisingly little info about load balancing designs in the DC. Most of it is cloud.

                              <span>I have been a victim of the so called &quot;deauthentication attacks&quot; on my wifi network and I have surveillance cameras connected to the network via wifi, that gets disassociated from my network whenever this attack appears.
 Question. Is it enough to have a wifi network device (router, AP, extender etc) that supports WPA3 and has the 802.11w standard (with protected management frames)? 
 Or do the cameras need something to them as well? Like do the cameras need to support 802.11w or something for this to work? My cameras doesn&#x27;t have Ethernet support.

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 ​
 Sorry if it sounds dumb or not. 
 So we have our own /24 ip-block and have connections in the 350 E Cermak data center, and we get everything routed correctly in our market, except google.
 Analyzing our traffic, any type of google traffic is not reaching the Chicago region, but going to Amsterdam which is a whole other country.
 What throws me off, any google traffic from our /24 blocks goes to Amsterdam, but if use our carrier network from DC I am able to reach google in our Chicago Market... 
 I have verified everything from Geo-Location is correct to anything, still makes me pull my hair out lol.
 Verified from our carrier that they are peering with google in the same building.
 ​
 Any reason why only Google tossing our traffic to another country?

Summary
This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) provides the top Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) used since 2020 by People’s Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored cyber actors as assessed by the National Security Agency (NSA), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). PRC state-sponsored cyber actors continue to exploit known vulnerabilities to actively target U.S. and allied networks as well as software and hardware companies to steal intellectual property and develop access into sensitive networks.
This joint CSA builds on previous NSA, CISA, and FBI reporting to inform federal and state, local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) government; critical infrastructure, including the Def…</span>

                              <span>So this one has been a doozy, I just wanted to see if anyone has experienced anything similar. 
 We recently had our static IP pool increased from a /30 to a /29. Ever since the change, we&#x27;ve had persistent bandwidth issues. Upload is pitiful, download is meh on what&#x27;s supposed to be 200 symmetrical. I spent way too much time this week digging through firewall configs, running iperf tests throughout the network, checkin MTU size, cables, and generally tearing our network apart while the ISP was unresponsive. 
 I tested multiple devices of different brands isolated on the direct connection, all capable of pulling gigabit+, and all pulled 60 max. Configured the firewalls to be glorified routers, both still pulled pitiful speeds. 
 I was running a tracert during this diagnosis and saw an interesting IP in there... our old gateway for the previous static pool we had. But the firewalls and routers I tested on the connection all had the new IP and gateway set. On each, packets hit the router, hit the old gateway ip, then went on their way. All show the new public static. 
 I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the cause of the bandwidth issues we&#x27;re having (though I believe I&#x27;ve conclusively ruled out anything on our end causing it unless like 6 different routers/firewalls with no extra configs have the same issue). 
 Anyone seen an ISP route you through the wrong gateway regardless of the config on your end? Definitely a first for me.

                              <span>I keep going round and round with the security guy at my work. He believes it is a perfectly acceptable solution to have an internal server accessible from the internet as long as it passes through some type of &quot;proxy&quot; in the DMZ. These proxies can range from an F5 virtual server that is NOT doing any WAF, to just an IIS box setup to reverse proxy. 
 In my mind I believe this is a bad idea because these proxies just do trash-in trash-out and any compromise that were to occur would now be in an internal server network instead of a DMZ.
 Is this really not as bad as I think it is, or am I right to question this practice?

 I just have a question or a curiosity to ask. I am currently a Jr Network Engineer. CCENT certified. Tried CCNA before the redo and failed by 25 points. Planning on taking it again before the year ends.
 My question is: After I pass (If I pass) CCNA, with the networking world changing and heading into automation and software defined networks, should I consider a cert such as DevNet? Or would I be wasting my time and should focus in something like CCNP or Juniper?

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious how you all handle your dynamic inventories? I have a inventory file I created with 500+ devices that I seperate into various groups, etc. It will become cumbersome to maintain by hand over time, with co-workers adding and removing devices on the network.
 What method do you all use to automate this? Do you do something like python scripts that interact with your NMS?

                              <span>Wondering if anyone on here can provide feedback on working with Cato networks?
 Cato’s infrastructure/Setup is very new to me but it is appealing, the whole idea of everything happening in cato’s cloud would pretty much replace a lot of appliances in our data centre.
 I’m looking for Pros,Cons and ultimately if its worth it as this would replace our VPLS infrastructure.

 Since almost that exact time, our production VLAN is incredibly unstable. We have all meraki MS 225 edge switches, MS 425 core switches, and an MX 400 security appliance. All traffic goes through the 425s and the MX 400 before exiting on the WAN port and going into a state owned and supported Cisco 3850 router. The router and everything outside of it is managed by the State, and I have no visibility or control over it, so I can only define what I&#x27;m doing to troubleshoot inside our network. 
 On our production VLAN, about every 10-15 minutes, we spike to around 100% packet loss…</span>

                              <span>When a firewall leaves a http client hanging because it got on a blacklist of some kind, what is this technique called in networking? I heard someone use the term sandtrapping but I found no references to this anywhere.
 Basically, if a client gets blacklisted, the firewall stop responding at some point in the process which will often make http clients just hang eternally. I&#x27;ve seen CMS providers do this before where once blocked, python http requests, curl, wget will all just hang up until the process is killed or if a explicit timeout is defined.
 Is there a term given for this type of technique in networking?

 It&#x27;s a stack of (3) Cisco 9300&#x27;s, and they&#x27;re all 48 copper port switches, however in the config it&#x27;s showing the following:
 switch 1 provision c9300-48t switch 2 provision c9300-24t switch 3 provision c9300-24t 
 I tried to just overwrite it by entering &quot;switch 2 provision c9300-48t&quot; while in global config mode but it doesn&#x27;t seem to change anything. After, I tried to remove the 24t entry first, but it says &quot;Error: A switch is already physically present at this location&quot;. 
 How can I get this to show up correctly so I can access/configure all 48 ports on switches 2 and 3?

 I&#x27;m racking my brains trying to figure it out but the network looks fine in our DC. 
 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has come across this issue as well before?

                              <span>Hello. I am having a problem with an automation I am writing but I am having some difficulty with troubleshooting SCP on a Cisco 2960X. 
 ​
 I have two different Ansible servers. One is local to the switch, same subnet, etc. The other is a remote host in Azure, with a port forward for this specific IP to translate TCP 2222 to 22 to this test switch. The local Ansible server appears to start SCP sessions as intended. No problems, nothing in the logs to indicate any problem, multiple 40 mb files transferred. The remote one is able to open a SSH connection, but SCP sessions fail. 
 I have turned debugging on in the switch and while I do see the remote Ansible server is able to start a session, there is little to nothing in the log to indicate a problem. Same with a packet capture. It appears to start a session, start a second session, then gracefully closes both sessions. 
 The code sample I am using on both Ansible servers is identical and a direct SCP session using Ubuntu CLI does not work either. 
 The only relevant error I am seeing is from the playbook when it fails:
 ​
  
TASK [Copying image to the switch... This can take time, please wait...] ************************************************************** 
 fatal: [%hostName%]: FAILED! &#x3D;&gt; {&quot;changed&quot;: false, &quot;destination&quot;: &quot;flash:/test.txt&quot;, &quot;msg&quot;: &quot;Exception received: Error transferring file to flash:/test.txt: Initializing SCP session of remote file [flash:/test.txt] for write failed with error [b&#x27;Socket error: No such file or directory&#x27;]&quot;}
  
I am frankly running out of ideas, as this makes no sense as to why its not working.

 I have a question regarding 802.1X. In our company we have a Development Department and guys need to run some VMs on their laptops.
 What would the behaviour be for the laptop with VMs installed?
  
Laptop will be authenticated and also VMs, since laptop (as host) is authenticated
 
Laptop will be authenticated but VMs will be not
 
Laptop will be unauthenticated also as VMs

                              <span>I have a set of network access requirements for some systems:
  
Domains or IP addresses
 Ports
  
I would need to block connections that are not to one of those domain/IP and port combination.
 In a firewall, I am able to hardcode IP addresses that need to be allowed. For example, I can create a rule to allow traffic:
  
TCP
 IP : 123.123.123.123
 Port : 25
  
And block all other Port 25 requests, for example.
 However, the tricky thing is when domains are involved. For example, if I need to allow:
  
TCP
 Domain : Reddit.com
 Port : 443
  
I need to allow Port 443 through my firewall, but I cannot hardcore any IP addresses.
 I am now using Cisco Umbrella for DNS filtering, so that I can block DNS requests to domains that are not approved. So in the above example, I would add Reddit.com to the allow list.
 However, with port 443 now open in the firewall, and since I cannot hardcore IP addresses and rely on DNS filtering, a virus could use an IP address to exploit port 443 (no DNS request to Cisco Umbrella).
 Cisco Umbrella has an agent to guard against this, but I can’t install it because I have a Ubuntu system.
 Cisco Umbrella aside, how can you guard against viruses using hardcoded IP addresses and circumventing DNS filtering?
 I should add : I am using Ubuntu Linux as a WireGuard sever, so not a NGFW

                              <span>So we have been having issues with a switch we recently put into place in a building on our base. The setup is as follows....
 Core switch &gt; 3850 fiber switch &gt; 3560 access switch
 With this setup, we have been having some problems and we believe they are related to AAA. Our AAA server is ISE and it is doing TACACS as well as RADIUS and MAB for clients.
 The failures seem to be intermittent, but basically out of 4 clients, only 2 of them will authenticate. The other 2 are not failing authentication, but the MACs are also not showing up anywhere. Its like they aren&#x27;t even there, even though the interface is up. The 2 devices will briefly be put into the correct VLAN, but then after a minute or so, they go back into our &quot;black hole&quot; vlan, and nothing about them shows up in the switch logs or ISE logs. 
 So my question is, could the issue be the fact that we are daisy chaining the 3560 and not going directly to our core switch? My boss seems to think that a setup like this is not how networking should be done. I do agree that it probably is not best practice, but I feel like the issue would be more so if the 3850 switch can handle the load of traffic going over it. Would there be any special type of configuration that needs done with a setup like this, besides just configuring a normal trunk port?
 Another thing that just popped up is we noticed that we have &quot;switchport block unicast&quot; on the trunk ports. We referenced another network that we managed and on that network, we only have that command on the access ports. Could that possibly be causing the inconsistent authentication errors?

                              <span>What is the rout selection process of a Router or L3 switch in deciding which route to take if it has vrf enabled. Will it check the global routing table first then if not found it&#x27;ll look at local vrf table, or will it check the vrf first then the grt? 
 Finally the one i&#x27;m bit confused is, if multiple vrfs has route to the same destination, which metrics are used to select the vrf to use.

                              <span>When i search for job applications the requirements say something like &quot;knowledge about active directory, windows server, mysql, linux...&quot;, do I have to know how to do everything before applying or can I &quot;get away&quot; with knowing some and learn the others on the job? learning would not be a problem because I like this field but I&#x27;m scared that without all the knowledge I can&#x27;t apply anywhere.
 For example let&#x27;s say I have experience with Debian but the company I want to apply to is using Ubuntu, so when the interview comes should I&#x27;d say I know linux but not Ubuntu specifically. Would this lower my chances of being hired by alot?
 When I know something in theory but don&#x27;t remeber the commands should i say I know how to do it and then watch online for the commands?
  
Thanks all in advance to all the replies, I&#x27;m a bit anxious and I don&#x27;t want to do bad in my first job!

 This means that if I have a device connected only to the master module and my master module is active, the VLAN does not reach the final device because the switch has to switch from master to slave?

                              <span>Hi guys, got an interesting issue at my workplace and would like to know if you guys have had any such experiences.
 . We maintain a sd wan network with remote sites all over the world and one of them was complaining about a server not being reachable intermittently, this server is accessed by this site only so we only got this complaint from them, interestingly, we are able to ping this server once or twice successfully from Site A core switch, but the rest of the attempts fail to reach for some time, then works again and so forth, meanwhile site B is able to reach it the same time A couldn&#x27;t, the same thing happens when trying from B when B couldn&#x27;t reach while A could, this is not a packet loss issue btw, when it pings, it pings perfectly without latency or loss even 10k reps, but when it fails, it fails completely. I understand the issue has to be with the server, but can&#x27;t figure out what, probably multiple session related, I would like to know if you guys have experienced any such issues, Im not deeply experienced myself but haven&#x27;t come across this issue.

 Let&#x27;s say i start the policy with fundamental template and set it to transparent and enforcement period is 7 days, now after 7 days will the policy move to blocking automatically? Or can i control the timing, because i wouldn&#x27;t want the policy to move into blocking at night or something, so how can i control the timing?
 Also, note the fundamental policy template starts in blocking mode right away..
 And even with 7 days of enforcement period, the automatic policy builder will restart the policy building process everytime it detects new traffic right? How does this work exactly?

                              <span>Does anyone know of a reasonably priced cloud-based RADIUS solution that can validate against Azure AD for user AND machine certificates with PEAP-EAP, and validate user credentials with PEAP-MSCHAPv2?
 I have trialed quite a few now (JumpCloud, RADIUSaaS, FoxPass) and they all seem to do user auth, but not device certificate auth. It looks like Portnox CLEAR could do it, but it is very expensive when we use half of the minimum device qty. Anyone have any suggestions?

 Lately I&#x27;ve been giving jr. members of the team an opportunity to deploy new stuff. I feel like I&#x27;m giving them the gift of a fun break from the monotony of working tickets. 
 Of course it could also feel like I&#x27;m dumping work on them, making them perform duties beyond their role, or expecting too much of jr folks. 
 How do you guys feel? What are ways I can make sure it&#x27;s a fun learning experience and not a heart attack?

I do all the hands-on work and implementation. I don’t have buy-in from CEO or Chairman (separate people) or execs, but they’ve begrudgingly gone alone with most of my changes, until now.

                              <span>I&#x27;m used to installing printers on a print server using print management.
 These new HP printers require this software package to install them that doesn&#x27;t run on Windows Server OS&#x27;s. 
 For instance: https://support.hp.com/ca-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-laserjet-pro-3001-3008dne-dwe-hp-printer-series/38120047/model/38120950
 The HP Universal Print Driver would not install as a driver for this device.
 To get this printer setup on our print server, I had to start the install on a Win10 workstation, Download the driver package, Move the package up to the server, Extract the files inside the .exe file, and install a driver using those extracted files. 
 What the heck am I missing here? I&#x27;ve started to see this on new HP Business printers more and more. How does HP want us to handle setting up these printers in an environment with AD? I want to be able to push them out with GPOs... What gives?

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been tasked with taking over management of a small management company in our organization. They are completely legally separate from our main org, so they can&#x27;t be on our main infrastructure. 
 They&#x27;re only 10 employees, but need an RDS server as they have an old-school financial system and a couple apps which need to run on a server (and need SQL). Currently they have an older RDS server managed by an outgoing MSP. That server is attached to the MSP&#x27;s domain, so the users use separate credentials for logging in to RDS.
 We&#x27;re replacing/upgrading the RDS server, which on the surface is easy enough. The challenge is - this company has no domain environment otherwise, so on top of an RDS server, we&#x27;d have to spin up a DC. They do have 365 / Azure AD though.
 Just wondering - is there a more graceful way of handling RDS without the domain? Could people login using Azure auth. I&#x27;m looking for the simplist and most gaceful way of hosting a small RDS environment for 10-12 users.

                              <span>Or in other words: Do I need a backup MX?
 The situation is this: I want to receive newsletters from news sites. Some senders are high traffic senders that send out a lot of emails to each subscriber, sometimes even 1 per minute, or 1 per 10 minutes on average.
 I have trouble with receiving this amount with various email service providers, because I run into receiving rate limits. So, I’m considering hosting my own mail server for this purpose.
 But self-hosting on a VPS can have outages…
 I don’t mind if some emails get lost if the senders don’t retry, but I don’t want them to stop sending me all together if my server goes down temporarily.
 Let’s say my server goes down for 1 or 2 days for whatever reason. (Let’s not discuss how likely it is. There may be an outage, or I may screw something up.) Also, let’s assume my server is either up or down, but when it’s up, it’s accepting mails normally. So, I’m not rejecting mails.
 So, the question is this: If there is a busy sender that sends out a huge number of emails, and they see my server went offline or port 25 is not responding for a day or two, then what happens? What’s the most common behaviour? Will they resume sending me when my server comes online again? Or will they consider me gone forever?
 Phrasing it in another way: How long would a receiving mail server need to be down in order for a busy sender to stop sending to it all together?
 Or does it depend on the sender and the situation, and there is no standard behaviour?
 The special situation here is that these are busy senders. I understand that normally a sender should and will retry. But when a sender sends out hundreds of emails a day or more to each of its subscribers, they may handle this differently.
 Again, I don’t mind lost mails, I just don’t want to re-subscribe to the newsletters after every outage I may have.
 And I don’t really want to have a backup MX unless I really need to.
 Some expert advice would be appreciated… Thank you.

                              <span>Just curious if and what limitations you have set in your environment. I ask because I just had to modify our policies for the Karens executives and their assistants who refuse to use OneDrive/SharePoint. Our policy is now 100MB limit for all users but all execs and their assistants are exempted. This is after I explained the ramifications and how easy it is to use OneDrive/SharePoint. Going forward, any complaints tickets about mailboxes over the size limit or performance issues will be closed with &quot;You were warned. Reap what you sew.&quot;

 I&#x27;m looking at APC models so far, any advice is welcome. These units will be running a few cisco switches, a meraki firewall (mx-85) and some other smaller devices like a unifi AP.
 Thanks!

Currently working for a big tech with a good salary especially in 3rd world countries. I thought it&#x27;s ok until realized that i was not following the cloud trend. Now they&#x27;re all talking about cloud, CICD, pipeline, microservices and can have a very attractive income. I&#x27;m reaching 40 soon and concerning about my career path. I have spent lot of time and effort to become a well-known person in my country and is one of the guys in my region can handle vmware vcd/vcf/vrealize suite along with nonstop backup system and multisite storages in-depth. All my skilled experience are used in very limited enterprise customer. Thinking about one day I receive the termination letter, how can I overcome. I don&#x27;t think I can&#x27;t get a new job but about the salary. How to keep it AS IS without knowing of new technologies. Does anyone of you guy facing the same issue with me?

                              <span>Hey all, I’m a sysadmin with a little over 3 years of professional experience in IT. I’m coming up on a year in my current role and am becoming stagnant. I don’t see any potential of upward mobility and my learning is decreasing over time. This has me looking for the next move. It’s no secret that DevOps and cloud are some of the hottest spaces in IT right now. Pondering transitioning into one of the other, some questions that come to mind are:
 -What are the pros and cons of each?
 -How similar are they? It seems like oftentimes I’ll see cloud and DevOps in the same sentence.
 -As a current sysadmin, what are the most important skills for me to acquire to land one of these roles?
 To expand a bit more on the last one, my current technical skillset includes general Windows enterprise management (AD, DNS, server administration w/ VMWare), intermediate scripting skill in PowerShell, automation experience with Ansible, exposure to monitoring/alerting with Prometheus &amp; Grafana… just to name a few. So pretty general sysadmin in the modern world I would say.
 To create a plan of action, I’m looking to determine what skills to develop and how to prioritize them. Some that immediately come to mind are:
 -AWS -Terraform -Python
 What am I missing from this list, and what are your thoughts?

                              <span>Hello Sysadmin,
 I&#x27;ve inherited an infrastructure with an Hyper-V Cluster running in Windows server 2012 over 4 PowerEdge FC630 in a FX Cluster , there was a crash of one of the blades, and I started to get around to understand how all of this was setup (knowing the previous Admin that worked on itisn&#x27;t there anymore)
 Basically right now I am facing an issue on SCVMM 2012/Hyper-V Cluter manager where I have the subnet created for LIVE Migration showing 2 subnets, the one for live migration (10.0.12.0/24) and the one for Heartbeat (10.0.11.0/24) and if I look at the Live migration settings on HyperV/SCVMM, there is indeed 10.0.11.0/24 configured as a subnet, and the delete button is greyed out, even if I add 10.0.12.0/24 and put it first, same thing if I run a powershell command, the subnet 11.0 won&#x27;t disappear
 How the setup is, NIC1 and NIC2 are bonded/teamed on the windows server, there&#x27;s a virtual switch created from SCVMM, with 3 interfaces on different vlan/subnet for Heartbeat/LiveMigration/HostHyperV
 Thanks for reading through and any help appreciated

                              <span>I&#x27;m the IT Manager of a 24/7 manufacturing SMB. When you go on vacation do you 100% not check any emails and not monitor anything? I almost find that more stressful. When on vacation I will do things like monitor when I get up before I leave for the day and possibly later in the night.
 For my honeymoon I did uninstall the Outlook app and told my lead to text/email me if there was something going on that he couldn&#x27;t handle. Email is still tricky because it&#x27;s all or nothing.
 How much interaction with work/your systems do you have when on vacation? If you say you disconnect 100% how are you backed up while you&#x27;re off?

Our SPF record doesn&#x27;t seem to include the IP address of SF&#x27;s servers. Is including their IPs on our SPF record all it&#x27;s going to take to fix?

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 Long-time lurker, first time poster here. I hope someone here can help me get some insights on this.
 From a lot of our users, we have been getting reports that Outlook unexpectedly crashes (complete process restart).
 So far it has been impossible to reproduce, we can only analyze the logs after the fact and the only thing we know so far is that if we turn one specific add-in off, then the problem stops (it&#x27;s a local add-in that helps sending e-mails with a configurable template). This add-in runs on .NET and is written in C#.
 While the support team of this add-in has been very involved with us in trying to fix this issue, there is still no way to reproduce it and management now presented us a deadline to fix it before the end of October.
 We have spent weeks gathering and…</span>

 Have a bit of a strange one... This morning we&#x27;ve had loads of users complaining that they received multiple Teams meeting cancellation emails for various old meetings in the early hours of the morning (4:00am UK time). I&#x27;ve spoken to one organizer of one of these meetings. It was set up in October 2020 and he&#x27;s adamant that he hasn&#x27;t manually cancelled it himself. It appears its been automatically cancelled and then a notification email was sent to all users of said meeting at 4:00am.
 Is this something Outlook / Teams does automatically?
 Are there any settings available to control this behavior - particularly not to send these emails in the early hours?
 Any help, greatly appreciated.

 I have user account that keeps locking out every couple of hours, the users account has been migrated to 365 but the logs say it is locking out against our on-prem exchange server and the source network address is an IP address from a Microsoft data center. 
 I’ve used netwrix and that says it is an Android 1.0 device with an incorrect password, the user says they don’t have an android device and using powershell the only mobile I can see that the user has with their email on is an iPhone which has successfully synced today. 
 Does anyone have any other solutions or things I could look at? I’m really starting to run out of ideas.

 Let&#x27;s say the users name is Dom Sales. He was set up as Dom Sale, which is wrong. I come back to fix this after he mentions it. Log into 365, update display name and contact info in active users. Save. 3 hours later it&#x27;s back to Sale. Log in again, this time make sure it&#x27;s updated in AzureAD and Exchange, query with PS. 3 hours later it&#x27;s changed back again. Log in with PS and update it again. Query with PS, check Exchange, Active Users, and AzureAD. 3 hours later it&#x27;s changed back.

                              <span>Esteemed Admins,
 I have a 2012 R2 box, which is more or less patched up to date, so far as I can tell.
 However, IIS is v6.2
 I gather IIS gets uplifted by Windows updates? What gives? 
 I need this box to be IIS 7.2 because reasons.. how do I get it there?

                              <span>Hi,
 We have a hybrid environment (Win2016/Exchange 2016), that I am gradually migrating to Office 365.
 Migrating users is going fluently.
 However we also have some distribution groups, used for &#x27;generic&#x27; email addresses. 
 The issue is that these distribution groups are not synced to Office 365 (by AD Connect). So as they are not visible in Office365, I can&#x27;t migrate them to Office 365. 
 For Ad Connect, I have made a security group &quot;AD Sync Office 365&quot;, that I have added all users to. And in AD Connect wizard, I am have selected this security group in the filtering page. So AD connect is only syncing object in this security group.
 So I am suspecting that our distribution groups are not syncing because these distribution groups are not a member of the mentioned security group. And I can&#x27;t find a way to add he distribution groups to this security group.
 In AD connect troubleshooting these distribution groups , I also get this error :
 Object is not present in sync scope as group filtering is enabled and the object is not a member of filtering group &quot;CN&#x3D;AD_Sync_Office365,OU&#x3D;Security Groups,OU&#x3D;MyBusiness,DC&#x3D;xxxxx,DC&#x3D;local&quot;.
 Do you have some advice?

 We already have a confluence instantce running. 
 Whats the best way to start documenting things. Do you use templates or something like that?

                              <span>I am having to enrol a number of devices into AzureAD + Endpoint (Intune) so they are managed and protected. There are a few devices that are used only for testing purposes running a batch of code for example but any user will do this.
 So I assume this is just getting an intune device license and setting it up as a shared device as per this guide??
 I&#x27;ve not done this before as all users are normally assigned to devices with M365 Bus prem or E3. Is this the correct way to do this?

                              <span>We have an RDS deployment running a single RemoteApp group and 4 load balanced Session Hosts.
 Due to issues with roaming profiles, we want to restrict this RemoteApp group to a single session per user as much as possible.
 I&#x27;m at the point where I&#x27;ve managed to change the sessions limit so individual session host VM will only accept 1 active/disconnected session per user, which is great cause it means we can&#x27;t have Mike logging into RDS #4 twice at the same time from 2 clients.
 ​
 However because the Session Hosts are load balanced using a broker, I can&#x27;t control on which server someone is going to get a session. Which means that even though Mike is logged into RDS #4, there&#x27;s a possibility he&#x27;ll also get a new session on RDS #2 if he logs on from a different PC.
 Preferably in this case want session RDS #4 to get disconnected and reactivated on his new client.
 ​
 Does anyone know whether this is possible?

                              <span>I want to run my Rust API web server on Hetzner&#x27;s cheapest cloud offering called CX11 for 4.55 €/month. Specs are:
 CX11
 vCPU 1 Intel
 RAM 2 GB
 Disk space 20 GB
 Traffic 20 TB
 The backend Rust app (using Actix) is a non-issue - it&#x27;s under 20MB and no RAM spikes at all even under benchmarking via wrk etc.
 The proxy server will by Nginx which is also a non-issue when it comes to RAM consumption.
 I want to use Ubuntu 22.04 but if it eat too much RAM perhaps I could try Alpine - I want to run things like wkhtmltopdf (this will spike the RAM for a few seconds unfortunatelly) etc. but perhaps that is a non-issue.
 I don&#x27;t want to use Docker - the 2 GB RAM would be an issue and with one file deployment of the Rust binary app it&#x27;s not worth it.
 The most important question I have is about the SQL db I will use.
 So, it has to be relational database and I have only a couple of options: MySQL, PostgreSQL and perhaps some forks like MariaDB or something else.
 Can you recommend a DB that is the most RAM efficient under heavy load? I am mostly interested in reads, not so much writes into the DB. As I said it is an API backend that mostly serves JSON via relatively simple selects and an occassional joint here and there - nothing too crazy though.
 I will probably off-load the homepage for not-logged in users and some mostly accessed parts of the app to Redis, but still, I want something that would work relatively well when it comes to the available 2 GB RAM even without Redis - at least from the beginning ;)
 It will be mostly mobile apps accessing the API, so frontend rendering etc. is not the problem here.
 Thanks for your recommendation and advice - especially if you have used Hetzner CX11 servers or some other servers like this with databases.

 We are looking for a controller-based network-solution with sites as UniFi&#x27;s solution for small-medium businesses due to the lack of support and products itself being out of stock.
 Essentially where we could gather all customer-sites and manage.
 Preferably not the most expensive brands.

                              <span>Hi, 
 Recently I have got into I.T, in our warehouse prob( 300-400 people overall) as someone with no IT background. We are working as system administrators even though we do not access to a lot of stuff, we have a HQ group called Central , they have to give permissions for certain stuff( I assue they are level 2 or level 3 ). So recently for preaparation for Black Friday our packing department have been prepared and did some mock test with like 50 packers at the same time. 
 The problem is that as soon as people (30-50 start to work the invoice from our printer gets really slow to print sometimes (1- 2 minutes, normally it takes like 5-10 second).
 We use DLX as a WMS. We have given a list to Central with all the cabinets and sockets that these printers are using so they can monitor it. They said they have not seen any slowness from that part. ok.
 In DLX we have a thing called &quot;Run Task&quot;. It basically shows when the sytem processed the order. So if you check the time from the moment you press the print button after you packed an order until the run task actually run you can see the time it took to process it. its quick like couple seconds. ok. 
 And then we have a print server where we have all the printers added ( something like a print host). This is the last idea we have currently to check how long does it take from the DLX to send the information to this print server. Everything we have checked or sent to Central came back as no issues or signs for slowness.
 Also its confusing because during people&#x27;s breaktime there were like 25 packers only, printing went back to like 5 second. And then after an hour with like 30 or 35 ish people it just slowed down to 1 minute again. ( it is kind of inconsistent.)
 ​
 Does anybody have any other idea what would worth to be checked?

                              <span>We have Sophos firewalls and the VPN is kinda flaky. Not looking to replace the firewalls.
 Is there a good solid VPN solution out there for end-user remote access to internal systems that we could use to replace that functionality in Sophos?

                              <span>Seriously, I hate hate hate working anything in Infrastructure IT. I’ve gone from job to job working various sys admin and cloud roles and they are all the same, public and private sector. Between the overnight maintenance windows, the early morning releases, the horrible on call, the boss who expects you in at your regular time despite being up at 2-4am for maintenance while on call, the sleep deprivation, constant projects and dealing with non technical people with big dreams but no idea how to achieve them so they look to you. I am so done with it all and feel like a failure to my family when I have to leave a job due to absolutely becoming a zombie of a person. 
 I remember being way happier when I worked at McDonald’s as a youth. At least I could go home and do whatever for the rest of the night and not have to worry about work. 
 My most care free time in IT was working as a 3rd tier Support Analyst, just working tickets out of Service Now all day and being on call once every 3 months where you could go years without getting called. I either need to try and do something like that again or change industries completely because IT Infrastructure is not it for me.

                              <span>We are a small org. Originally we use AD to manage OUs and users. The users mainly use Gsuite. So if an admin changes password they usually do it through G admin.
 We now have a bunch of windows devices managed through AD using intune also account.
 What&#x27;s the best approach for password sync Or should we keep them separate..?
 MS pass to log into devices and Gsuite for cloud?

 I&#x27;ve had it with this vendor and since the big heads at my company seem to just love throwing money at them, I can&#x27;t pull up and say that we are wasting time and money dealing with a vendor that puts as little effort as possible into my team&#x27;s requirements.
 Background... I manage field support for a utility. My team consists of 10 techs covering around 150 sites (plants, offices, field dispatch, etc) on the USA east coast (NY down to NC). My team uses this vendor for sourcing and configuration of Cisco gear (switches, routers, WAPs), but they&#x27;re involved in a lot of my company&#x27;s critical applications and infrastructure.

They know I&#x27;m a junior in this role but I still feel incredibly in over my head, today was my first day and tomorrow I&#x27;m going to be doing my first actual tasks/problems, any veteran sysadmins got advice for keeping the anxiety down and also moving relatively quickly, I&#x27;ve already poured heavily over documentation used to run our infrastructure and the architecture of it, it&#x27;s your standard k8s-docker setup with some virtual machines and bare metal, with a bit of Ansible and ovirt.
 Feeling like I&#x27;m going to do something stupid that will get me fired or reveal myself as too incompetent (honestly probably not that justified of a fear considering the company is having a hard time finding people but still and they had no problems with me being a junior but i dunno, expectations are hard to measure!). 
 (My previous work was in security testing, compliance and a small amount of security maintainance/implementation on infrastructure, although not containerised at all, just bare metal servers).

                              <span>It&#x27;s Wednesday! Time to get that crap that&#x27;s been bugging you off your chest! In the interests of spicing things up a bit around here, we&#x27;re going to try out a Rant Wednesday thread for you all to vent your frustrations. Feel free to vent about vendors, co-workers, price of scotch or anything else network related. 
 There is no guiding question to help stir up some rage-feels, feel free to fire at will, ranting about anything and everything that&#x27;s been pissing you off or getting on your nerves!
 Note: This post is created at 00:00 UTC. It may not be Wednesday where you are in the world, no need to comment on it.
