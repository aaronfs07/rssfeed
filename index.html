                              <span>Hi. I have two simple Windows VPS. One is Windows Server 2019, the other is Windows Server 2022. Before, on my Windows 2012 VPS, I was using Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer to scan it for vulnerabilities that hackers could use to hack into my VPS. Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer was quite good and if my memory is correct, it would also check your ports, check if certain protocols were enabled that hackers could abuse (ie. checked if SMBv1 was enabled), etc, which was really useful.
 Unfortunately, Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) has been discontinued by Microsoft and I don&#x27;t think the last version is even applicable to Windows Server 2019/2022. Is there another very popular software that administrators use to scan a Windows Server for vulnerabilities and if so, how much does it cost (MBSA was free)?

                              <span>Hello everybody!
 My office recently got a lot of Cannon 3226i machines and a cannon 4835 machine. Now I set up the 4835 scan to folder and it took a minute barely.
 But when trying to set up the 3226 scan to folder it will not work. Anything I do wont work. I did the same thing with the 4835 and it keeps giving me the #801 error. Tried updating firmware/installing uniflow online express, making a user dedicated to accessing the shared folder, everything. Always give me a wrong user/pass when trying to connect to the NAS server via machine, and when configuring from the UI always gives me #801 even though the 4835 works perfectly, anyone had the same problem? Going crazy here

                              <span>So we&#x27;re looking for a password manager for our business and with all the LastPass issues I saw Keeper Security mentioned who aren&#x27;t one I had really heard of until now.
 Their website has some pretty good info on it around their security model and how secure they are but of course &quot;they would say that wouldn&#x27;t they&quot; seems to apply.
 I have a few people who&#x27;ve been using LastPass now asking me what I&#x27;d recommend and usually I say to look at Bitwarden or 1Password but this looks quite good.
 Is anyone using them please and if so what&#x27;s your feedback on the product both for enterprise and individual use?

                              <span>Hi all, Title pretty much says it.
 It happens cause the system tries to show folders and files from the domain file server
 I&#x27;ve managed to cancel this in windows file explorer, unchecking remember folders and files in folder options but have no idea how to do it in office.
 Also a lot of time for log in screen trying to contact dc.
 Any ideas? This is really annoying.

 Recently, however, Domino server crashed and had some real troubles to work correctly. Domino is hosted, of course, by owners friend, somewhere in a garage. (both are old blokes who worked in IT in 90&#x27;s okay, so they &quot;KNOW EVERYTHING&quot;) I told them many times that its a bad idea to rely on whole email system to be hosted somewhere on a home internet, and that guy is amateur who dont update his…</span>

 Anyone know if theres a downloadable version of the command line tools? I had some nice scripts set up to pull in the lists of pending patches for machines. This has now broken and I can&#x27;t see any other way of achieving the same result.

                              <span>Last week, I found a domain search whois type of site that displayed traffic estimates and ranks. For a couple very small sites I know, it estimated &lt;200 visitors in a month, and the rank was like somewhere in the millions. For a much larger site, like cbs.com, it reported/estimated it at top 100 or so, and I think I entered &#x27;facebook.com&#x27; and it said #2 at 600MM visitors. I understand these estimates are directional at best, but I thought it was a neat addition to a typical whois search, which doesn&#x27;t really reveal much these days with GDPR in effect.
 I was using Private Mode on Firefox, so it didn&#x27;t log in my history, and I can&#x27;t remember the site now and it&#x27;s driving me nuts. Anyone have a lead? Thanks!

                              <span>Hey guys! First time posting on this subreddit, so please forgive me for any mistakes. 
 I am starting a company where I will give my partners/users, an android device, which has a few apps they still use to access my service. The concept is kind of like doordash, but perhaps a bit more individual. 
 For this system I have been looking into a few things, among other things the Soto MobiControl system. To give a better insight of what’s needed and why I will provide a short description below.
  
A way to remotely access the devices so that my team can do the debugging in case something goes wrong, instead of having to try and explain to the users what to do. 
 With this I am also looking to heavily restrict what apps can be accessed, and also settings so the device can only be used for its actual purpose, and the chance for problems by pressing something wrong occurring decreases.
 An easy way to automatically set up the devices with the right apps and restrictions, perhaps using a connection to a pc or something along those lines.
  
I have looked a bit into the Soti platform, but as far as I have understood I need a dedicated server with databases and stuff to use their solution, which is per today not an option. 
 The perfect scenario would be a cloud based system for accessing the above mentioned functions, preferably a cheap one too since we are a completely new company with not much money to spend. I am looking forward to you guys’ ideas!

 Am I missing something about real jobs or the LinkedIn recruiters are completely lost? At my point of view, DevOps and Cloud Engineers have different responsibilities.

                              <span>Left a company almost a year ago. Got a call today because the owner couldn’t access his computer remotely from home.
 Was told by the replacement IT person that they got hit with ransomware, incl backups. 
 So I said - the documentation is written in a binder in the office with everything you need and why are the backups encrypted?
 Find out that the IT person copied the documentation to the server and threw out the book. They also got rid of immutable backups because it costed to much money. 
 They offered me my old pay (per hour) to help. 
 I wished them a happy holidays and good luck
 Felt so good. 
 Happy Holidays ya’ll!!!

                              <span>It&#x27;s my understanding that the secret key adds an additional layer of security (not sure if Bitwarden has something similar).
 I have used, and will continue to use, the example of cracking the verifier, as that has a nice analogy to cracking password hashes on a traditional service like Barkbook. But what is at stake here is whether Mr. Talk, given access to what is stored on our servers, would have the capacity to decrypt Molly’s data. Molly’s 1Password Secret Key means that the answer is no. Mr. Talk would not be able to crack that even if he put every computer on Earth to work on the cracking and ran them for zillions of times the age of the universe. I am happy to use words like “never” and “impossible” for that.

                              <span>Finally I quit my previous job and now I am kinda system administrator (SA) in an educational institution. Some scientists, some managers, some students, little money but great possibilities for personal activities. I am just to ask: what one should do first when he/she gets a SA job? What plan one should have, how to act and what is the most important thing to pay attention to? What was your experience, your best practice? I have no time for great but annoying literature, do are there any cheatsheets? I am asking because now I have more than 100 workstations, no central management like AD or stuff, some Win10, a lot of Linux RHEL, no security, no docs and so on. And I just want to make things right,)
 Thanks

                              <span>Remembering two years ago when we had a datacenter outage due to a fibre cut in LA (216 strands had to be re-spliced by the provider, *after* hours of excavation trying to get to the pipes because it was so deep, from a holiday backhoe and some poor soul who read a map wrong most likely). This a few hours after the Christmas explosion outside AT&amp;T&#x27;s POP in downtown Nashville, making us think our DC was also under terrorist attack. Good times... time to repaid fibre strands: two days.

                              <span>Team is looking at using RedSeal&#x27;s on prem tool to map our network out. Supposedly you can ingest firewall rules from your devices into the program and it plots out your network for you, showing you what could potentially be exposed to the internet and on what ports so you can review and shutdown any open holes you&#x27;re not fully aware about or got lost in bad documentation/poor communication issues.
 It&#x27;s pretty pricy though, the 1st demo I had looked decent but the inventory side of it i&#x27;ve already accomplished via Netbox. I could do the network topology too via Netbox but that&#x27;s manually entering things in instead of allowing a tool to go out, grab the firewall rules and ingest it properly. I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a ansible script method I could use to poll all that info and feed it up into Netbox&#x27;s api but that&#x27;s more work then I have the time for currently.
 Was curious if there were any other open source alternatives to this tool or people&#x27;s thoughts and opinions on it?
 Mostly a RHEL/Ubuntu shop with some Windows hosts peppered throughout.

 I just want to know, so I know when the time that will eventually come, comes:
 Is it actually hard to replace, or is it simple and I can do it, but they say its not to cover their butts?

                              <span>I am a 31-year-old junior system administrator. 
 Long time lurker here and nonnative English speaker.
 ​
 Prior to my current role I have worked as helpdesk and field support specialist.
 I love computers and am always motivated to play around on my homelab.
 At home I have an ESXi and Hyper-V host with, Windows server with domain stuff, Linux VM’s, OPNsense, Docker, unRAID, VEEAM. I have 11 entry level IT certifications, MCSA, Exchange, LPIC, ITIL, Comptia, CCNA the basic stuff.
 At the moment I work in an office as internal IT in a team with 3 other junior admins. We are the escalation point of the helpdesk which does suck because we still have to do helpdesk work. The helpdesk techs are on the lowest level I have seen in my career, tech and communication wise.
 My coworkers like to waste half of the day talking about Marvel with the helpdesk technicians and all other types of nonsense. (This will not improve with current management and will probably take years to turn around)
 I currently work on IT projects with other teams and my senior colleague which is interesting. But I do not get any useful input from the other junior admins, they prefer slacking off and goofing around. So, I am kind of a one-man army I have only my senior colleague as a sparring partner and he has a full schedule.
 I find it hard to stay motivated, I am the most technically knowledgeable person in IT besides the senior admin and architect. My colleagues do not show any interest in improving and I have to spoon-feed the helpdesk. So it feels like I do all the giving.
 Does anyone have any tips to deal with this?

 We have had issues with techs changing port configs for key systems or taking things out of agg groups because they don&#x27;t understand what they are used for. Even after these mistakes I would push towards POLP and they would shoot it all down.
 Well today I&#x27;m having to rebuild an ESXi cluster due to another issue caused by untrained people having access to key systems. I&#x27;m sure when I go to the lead meeting on Wednesday they will still shoot down my suggestions.
 Who else has to deal with this nonsense? I&#x27;m all for people leveling up but a production environment is not the place for this.

 Does anyone have any ideas to make a POE Pager device thats powered by a POE Switch smart? It needs to be rebooted every week or so and I need a way to do that remotely. I wanted to use a smart plug on a POE injector but the device is plugged into a poe switch and I&#x27;m not sure if I unplug/turn off the power to the injector will it cut the power to the device if the input to the injector is POE it will still have power from poe, right?
 Does anyone know of any other alternatives i.e. female to female RJ45 poe passthrough device that can remotely cut and restore power?

                              <span>I had posted in the Meraki sub and wanted to get everyone’s thoughts. I have been told that geolocation rules do not apply to people connecting to the VPN and for example if someone tried connecting to our network from a country we block such as North Korea or Russia and they had someone’s credentials they would have access. I can’t see how this would even be possible or even allowed? We require Duo for additional verification but I am sure there are a ton of people that don’t do this.

 ​
 I have been testing the Mapped drives Group Policy Pref in Win2k12R2 Domain Controller.
 ​
 I have no problem setting up the mapped drives But I am getting &quot;Could not reconnect all network drives.&quot; notification message.
 ​
 how do I troubleshoot why?
 ​
 ​
 GPO Setting:
 ​
 ​
 Under the GPO I have it Set to &quot;Update&quot; 
 ​
 it Points to \\ad.contoso.com\Contoso SharePoint\DeptAdmin 
 ​
 it is set to Reconnect (for persistence)
 ​
 it is Set to Map to M:
 ​
 Under the Common Tab I have :
 ​
 - Item-Level targeting - Ticked
 ​
 ------- Under Targeting I have the Security Group &quot;DeptAdmin&quot; listed
 ​
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>&#x27;Twas the night before Christmas just as I was laying into the eggnog that I got a call from the building engineer that no disks were spinning. &quot;The power is out and has been for 2 hours!!&quot; he proclaimed as I thought of the 90 minutes that my UPS&#x27;s had toiled away in vain. With no promises that power would return soon I pulled the plugs from the PDUs with visions of long bridge calls dancing in my head. 
 Fuck this shit! I proclaim as a user IMs to ask why he can&#x27;t remote in. 
 On a more serious note.... Any recommendations for drinks while recovering a VXrail with VSAN disks from an unclean shutdown on X-mas day?

 we currently have about 25TB of files on our old file server. I will migrate to the new file server. But I have file system.
 We have VMWare ESX environment and SAN SSD Storage. 
 1 - Regardless of space and dedup capabilities, are there any other benefits for using ReFS vs NTFS?
 2 - Does anyone know if 2022 OS on the REFS file system is supported by Veeam agent ? 
 3 - Lastly, is ReFS ready for production? Stable?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been handed over an issue that is a strange one. We use AnyConnect for NAM only and F5 for our VPN.
 There&#x27;s multiple windows laptops (MACs aren&#x27;t experiencing this issue) that run into an issue in which when they disconnect from the F5 VPN or when the VPN session times out their WiFi connection will drop and AnyConnect will either sit there and say associating to their home WiFi network or say &quot;No Adaptors Available&quot;. The issue will persist until either the AnyConnect client/service is ended or the laptop is rebooted.
 Cisco TAC insists it&#x27;s not AnyConnect. Microsoft doesn&#x27;t feel like touching it since it&#x27;s 3rd party software. 
 Our client team has tried every WiFi driver they could get their hands on. They&#x27;ve tried Windows 10 and Windows 11. They&#x27;ve tried a fresh image. All resulted in the same symptoms.
 Has anyone seen these kind of issues before? Any solutions or suggestions?

                              <span>I am currently playing around with some alternative but popular platforms like pFsense/OpnSense and feel like they are throwbacks to ASAs with rules defined by intereface/vLAN etc.
 I really love the clean single list style of PaloAlto/Juniper firewalls where a rule is a rule, from and to and it works, vs building rules on a per interface basis to build things up.
 What other platforms are Zone / Flow based and in the small business price range? Any open source options?

I want to be back into the industry and I want to know where do I start again with the current trends in Networking. I would like to learn SDN also and where do I start with it? PS. I’m learning Azure and AWS fundamentals as well to catch up.

 I&#x27;d like to gain familiarity with Ansible and Docker/kubernetes too, as we use these in my work environment. I wonder if there is a lab environment I could build that incorporates all these elements.
 I appreciate any tips you could give!

 I configured openvpn on Fedora. I know that it&#x27;s working because when I run a traceroute command, I see the traffic taking another route when I&#x27;m connected.
 However, when I try &quot;what is my IP address&quot; in the browser, I see the same IP address, so I&#x27;m puzzled.
 Shouldn&#x27;t the IP address be different too ?
 Thank you !

 I’m starting my automation journey soon and need some ideas! I’ve dabbled with python scripts and ansible in the past but not to much, and will be using gns3 for my topologies.

                              <span>Upcoming project will have us installing cameras on parking lot light poles. Four cameras and a weatherproof NEMA box bolted to the light pole. Inside the box will be an 8 port network switch. Switch will be connected via fiber down the pole and into buried conduit back to the main building.
 The NEMA boxes will be in direct sunlight. It&#x27;s Florida. It&#x27;s humid. And also, tt&#x27;s going to be really effing hot in those boxes.
 I&#x27;ve found a few switches rated up to 60C but I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s high enough, based on our testing. Last summer, we put one of the NEMA boxes in direct sun and put a simple mechanical thermometer inside and it did in fact reach 65C/150F. 
 So... anybody got any ideas that can do PoE (only maybe 50W total) and survive these kinds of environments? Or some other way of doing this?

                              <span>I would like to set up a tftp server in AWS to provide a central place to copy equipment configurations to, from network equipment I have all over the world. 
 I am able to connect to the tftp server on udp/69 but the data transfer to copy the data on an alternate udp port seems be blocked. I have permitted all udp ports on the security group for the instance, but not luck. Does anyone know of any other location in AWS / VPC that may block udp traffic of a tftp server?
 I was able to verify that the tftp server does work. I am able to transfer data via tftp within a VPC subnet. It does not work when the traffic is coming from outside the VPC 
 Also I tested two different tftp servers, tftp64 on windows, and in.tftpd on Linux,.and the same behavior occurs on each system. 
 To reiterate. Connections on port udp/69 work. The file name comes through to the server and the server creates the file name to be written to. But the data stream that transfers the actual file data on an alternate udp port seems to be blocked and no data is written to the file. 
 I am stuck, but would like to learn more about AWS plumbing. And felt this might be a pertinent issue to other folks on this sub.

 What connections would I need specifically for this drive, SAS PCI-E card and cable would I need exactly? The software and usage I think I&#x27;m good with, its just sourcing correct compatible hardware.

                              <span>Just wanted everyone’s 2 cents on where I should go for certifications next. I’ve gotten my A+ and my Az900 and am currently working on my AZ104. But I’m not sure wether to complete the comptia big three or continue on with an Azure expert certification after. My end goal is some sort of infrastructure architecture role for small to large enterprises dealing with a hybrid environment. Meaning dynamic networking management and deployment. Any suggestions? Thanks in advance!

                              <span>As the title said. We have a scheduled script where sometimes it throw an error. So far we have the error notice through email, then someone has to RDP into the centralized server and correct the script before the next scheduled time. 
 I’m thinking of postpone the script and has a medium or something to approve the script after the error has been corrected. 
 PowerAutomate seems promising with the cloud flow + desktop flow integration (premium license). Something along the line of sending email to a monitoring mailbox, extract the body, condition check the extracted body, and call desktop flow to trigger another PowerShell script. 
 Discussed internally and one guy bring up using teams to triggers power automate process. How does this works, does it work with a 1-1 chat or has to be teams channel chat. I looked up google but nothing really pin point my answer. A lot of posts hinted to a teams channel. 
 Anyone has any working automated approval process for scripting or anything similar?

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m being selfish or just a total dick.
 Currently I&#x27;m the person who works most in IT support, I deal with things like networking, infrastructure, etc. I have several meetings with customers and other companies for software implementations that my company provides.
 I solve all kinds of problems and face all kinds of situations without anyone&#x27;s help.
 I see my other co-workers and they are usually wasting time on social media watching videos, memes or things like that.
 Yesterday we had a brief meeting with the head of the IT department and he said that his goal is that we all get the same payment, even knowing that their level of education is different (I have undergraduate, graduate and I&#x27;m studying to get a CCNA certificate) and the others didn&#x27;t even went to college.
 Honestly, I can&#x27;t understand why. It seems like all the effort I put in doesn&#x27;t bring any return and I&#x27;m tired of it because when things get tough I&#x27;m always &quot;need to be&quot; there to help.

                              <span>Any of my fellow sysadmins on call over the holidays? Just wondering how your employers handles the time like with holiday pay, comp time, etc.
 At my old job we got screwed if we had to work during a holiday week because you&#x27;d need over 8 hours before you could get anything extra because overtime and/or comp time only counted for &quot;hours worked&quot; so we&#x27;d get straight regular pay unless we worked over 8 hours.

                              <span>We started using MS Defender Plan 2 for email protection, which gave us two canned presets, Strict and Standard. I have several users on the strict policy, but I don&#x27;t like that it&#x27;s immutable, i.e., no granular control. And it seems to stop processing rules below its priority, so incompatible settings never get applied. For instance, it won&#x27;t allow the first contact warning tags, and it isn&#x27;t campatible with spam notifications and letting the users release their own. I don&#x27;t need all that work. So my question is: Is there anything the presets do that can&#x27;t be done by building my own policies? Can I still get the same level of impersonation protection, etc.? Thx!

 Software rollouts aren’t usually fun, especially when they’re hastily patching a production bug.
 A few lifetimes ago, my team had to move the company’s internal software to a larger server overnight without the assistance of the development team. And for bonus points, the dev team lead had a habit of not showing up during big releases and turning off his phone.
 The plan was simple:
 - Migrate to a bigger server
 - Send users to the bigger server
 - ???
 - All problems are solved
 Users were notified of the details via email, and signs were posted on the doors as they entered the office. Restart your computer, and the automated scripts will update the links to point to the new server.
 This plan did…</span>

                              <span>Hi All,
 ​
 ​
 I will design DFS-N environment for my company. But I have some your valueable ideas.
 ​
 1 - (Option 1 )DFS-N multi namespaces for each department or (Option 2) DFS-N single namespace for all department. What&#x27;s best practices for this ?
 ​
 I want to config very manageable structure.
 ​
 ​
 Option 1 :
 ​
 https://imgur.com/a/kK4Aipc
 ​
 ​
 Option 2 :
 ​
 ​
 ​
 https://imgur.com/a/XLXWisc
 ​
 ​
 ​
 2- What&#x27;s best practices for those permissions for DFS-N environment? I will setup something like that. 
 ​
 ​
 e.g
 ​
 ​
 DFS NameSpace Name : DATA
 ​
 ​
 Permissions : (Everyone removed, &amp; Authenticated Users &#x3D; Read) under Customize and FULL Control for Administrators
  \-- IT (Folder) --&gt; Folder Target : NS\_IT 
 NS_IT : Sharing Perm : IT_SG : Modify and FULL Control for Administrators
 NTFS Perm : IT_SG : Modify and FULL Control for Administrators
 ​
 ​
 ​
 3 - I will use Item-level Targeting for drive mapping. I will use Security Groups. Also I want to do the drive mapping for each department.
 ​
 So , G for IT DePartment ,H for HR Deparment and so on. 
 ​
 Lets say , any user moved from the IT department to the HR department. How can I manage the GPO here?
 ​
 ​
 Now I have tested it. I have created a GPO like below.
 ​
 But , although the user moves to the HR department, IT sharing mapping still remains.
 ​
 GPO:

                              <span>I&#x27;m sill learning the ropes and trying to understand what benefit my predecessors were after by using a 23 bit network. For a small business (120ish users and associated &#x27;stuffs&#x27;), it just seems unnecessary. What were they likely trying to gain? I only ask as it seems to catch out quite a few people when things go wrong.

                              <span>Hello all,
 We are planning to migrate Azure AD Connect from version 1.6.x to the latest version on a new server, via the staging mode method. I already did this in the past, and the process is quite straightforward.
 But in this context, this is a bit different. In the initial configuration of Azure AD Connect, ADFS was configured as the sign-in method. So, during the the AAD Connect wizard on the new server, we have to choose « Federation with ADFS » at the « Sign-in » step, and then, selecting the existing ADFS farm.
 My main concern is about the next step &quot;Azure AD domain&quot;: (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/media/how-to-connect-install-custom/adfs6.png)
 We have several federated domains, and here we can choose only one. What will be the impact for all the other ones ? And also for the one that I will select ? All these domains are already correctly federated, I don&#x27;t really understand what will happen at this step. Do we have to expect user impact ?
 Thanks for your help. Kevin

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking to self host a DNS web filtering system for use at work. We outsource at the moment to a well known hosted platform in Ireland but the support is terrible and we want our own system we can manage internally. It must be a server based application and not an appliance as we host at AWS.
 I have been doing some googling and some old recommendations seems to be Squid with DansGuardian ( we prefer Linux based platforms ) but i notice DansGuardian is no longer a thing. E2Guardian seemed to take over but that also no longer seems to be active.
 Can anyone recommend a current open source platform we can use that can be cloud based on our own server.

So I installed a new SSD, cloned the main drive an it wouldn‘t boot saying something about booting in UEFI mode. The thing is it was booted in UEFI mode. So I turned some options on and off here and there and the last one was an option calley something with ROM usage. I turned it to EFI-able ROM and now the PC boots to a black screen with a white typing indicator. The BIOS icon is also way smaller than before and I can‘t access Boot-Menu or BIOS.
 If anyone could help me I would very much aprecciate it.

                              <span>This might not be a place to showcase but do you folks think this projects has a good ground? From my experience it&#x27;s useful because it can solve the following scenarios for me:
 - While interning at a company the devs were in bed and suddenly the service went down, no-one had the willingness to get up and SSH into the server and fix it. Fix was a restart. Overenergetic intern was willing but not granted SSH access since even with minimal permissions it&#x27;s a security risk and interns cannot be trusted with production server.
 - While interning as a backend dev, push to staging branch auto deployed the changes, but since maintaining SSH credentials for every employee/intern is tedious, I had to Slack call the server person and get a screenshot of logs which was a pain
 ​
 MobXcess is a tool suite that can run commands 🛠️ on your server☁️ from your mobile📱 device securely
 PS: No SSH Needed 🤫🙅‍♂️
 MobXcess is developed in two parts:
  
Server-Side system developed using Golang
 Client-Side system developed using Flutter
  
The communication is secured using AES-256-GCM cryptography.
 Since it&#x27;s a REST API, adding SSL will elevate security to a new level.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 merry xmas!
 Does anyone know if there is a source with all the IP Ranges used by Microsoft Autenticator? We would like to use the Location part of the new number-matching feature of Microsoft Authenticator.
 However, since we are using a web proxy it keeps showing a location very far away from where the user actually sits (depending on web proxy location - ZScaler in our environment). The idea would be to exclude the IPs from ZScaler in order to get real and authentic location information.
 How did you solve the issue?
 The obvious alternative would be to deactivate the location matching in the Authenticator but we actually like the feature.

                              <span>Looking at the posts joking about making changes now reminds me of a story. Working at an MSP, one of our clients was a nation wide radio station that had special uptime requirements. And naturally, like many an organization, we also had an on-call agent for weekends and holidays.
 So it is Christmas morning, I wake up to a phone call from our on-call agent who also happens to be the senior architect/engineer/sysadmin/flavor of the day. &quot;Are you still in town?&quot; Without thinking, I stupidly answered &quot;yes&quot;. That was how I got to spend Christmas day traveling hours to a rural radio tower and replacing a dead firewall.
 Turns out, everyone else was smarter than me, the architect included, and were all &quot;out of town&quot;.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a little ways into an MSP job that requires daily standup meetings that often run for 90 minutes or more. I&#x27;m making my best effort to pay attention and take notes (if for no other reason than to force myself to focus), but I often find myself tuning out anyway. And I won&#x27;t know until several minutes into a topic discussion that my boss is going to conclude the discussion by assigning the matter to me, whether or not my attention span had failed me 45 minutes into the meeting.
 Which brings me to my point: I need technology assistance here. What software solutions can the community recommend to live transcribe these meetings using the microphone on an Intel Macbook Pro? Unfortunately, it looks like the built-in Mac live caption software only works on Apple silicon. I&#x27;m willing to pay money if that&#x27;s what it takes, but hoping to avoid shelling out for full-blown Dragon.

                              <span>I feel as if Azure ADDS is extremely limited, I realize that it isn&#x27;t a replacement for ADDS, but being cloud only and having multiple vendors who use/integrate LDAP, it seems that Azure ADDS has very limited functionality. No way to integrate ADDS into Azure ATP, Cannot do custom delegation, one way sync from Azure and if I want to move groups to different OU&#x27;s, I&#x27;m having to create them in ADDS, but can&#x27;t reverse sync them to Azure, machines also don&#x27;t hybrid join, so having a hard time with intune GPOs, the list could go on...
 Recommendations? I think having devices join to AAD is great with Intune, but I don&#x27;t think being cloud-only for identities, and not having an on-prem instance is ideal.
 Ideally, I&#x27;m thinking we leave the environment in it&#x27;s current state, but move identities on-prem, including groups, and sync everything via AD Connect, while leaving machines joined to AAD, so on-prem won&#x27;t really need to be open all over with VPN tunnels flying around, just for the purpose of syncing objects, servers, VM&#x27;s, etc and far better management. Thoughts?

                              <span>Hi All,
 I’m taking on a new role around mid January, this is the highest job title I have gotten so far, it involves designing, documenting and automating resources deployed on Azure, I’m well versed in log analytics and azure automation accounts and CLI to automate workflow in azure.
 What are the other tools I need to research and study? 
 How are you guys handling automation of Active Directory deployed in Azure? 
 Happy Holidays!! 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello, seeking advice or experience on moving from HPE Nimble to Dell EMC Unity.
 We currently have 3 ESXi 6.7 hosts connected to a 140TB HPE Nimble CS-1000 on 10gbps iScsi. This Nimble only has 4TB of deduplication capacity. The Unity 380 we were quoted is 384TB with the first shelf (about 74TB) being all SSD, the remaining capacity is 7200 rpm HDDs. 
 Looking for advice and opinions on HPE vs. EMC in this configuration. Most of our storage usage comes from Windows 2016/19 file server VMs.
 How would you compare HPE Nimble to EMC Unity especially in regard to deduplication?
 All of our ESXi hosts are Dell R750s (upgrading from R730s)
 Thank you for any help or advice.

                              <span>I&#x27;m the middle of a 2 week notice from a position where I am the senior most individual contributor in the IT org. New job is over a 60% salary increase, better PTO, and explicitly remote. The current place made a counter offer to match and offered a 75k retention bonus paid out after 1 and 2 years in a 25/75% split. 
 The day before I had my interview scheduled, it was announced that the company was acquired. While larger, the acquiring company&#x27;s IT infrastructure is lagging behind and was hoping to leverage my company&#x27;s expertise to help modernize their systems and processes. That expertise heavily is me.
 Fuck em. I make less now than when I was hired due to inflation, and it&#x27;s like that across all departments. If you&#x27;re not at the exec level, they don&#x27;t care about CoL. I might get my piece but my team is still going to get their shit raises. And I&#x27;m just... jaded. I don&#x27;t think I could be happy with anything they offer.
 I&#x27;m spending all my time left brain dumping and documenting, I&#x27;m not going to make stuff hard for my team. I wish I could take them with me, and I&#x27;ve warned my managers that a couple of them are definitely underpaid and may lose them. 
 Best Christmas in a long time.

                              <span>I need to add some temperature monitoring to two small server rooms in two different buildings. We&#x27;re a small shop without a lot of budget for this. The Internet connection for these locations is pretty solid. 
 Ideally, I want a simple sensor we can just data cable (not WiFi) to a switch, with a basic cloud based server. It would alert us (via text, email, or app notification) when the temperature goes outside of a specified range or when it loses connectivity or fails to report within a certain time period. And last, keep a record of temperature reported so, when it loses connection, we can see what the trend was. 
 It seems to me this is a decently big ask on a small budget, but I thought I&#x27;d reach out and see if anyone has an experience or recommendations in this field. So far Google has brought up a bunch of options without much context of what is a good option and what is not.

                              <span>Hi,
 We&#x27;re a medium sized MSP (250 employees) and we&#x27;re currently using LastPass and in the light of what happened we&#x27;re really unsure of what service to continue with, and currently leaning towards not continuing with LastPass. But before we decide fully we want to do some evaluating on LastPass. Our Yearly subscription renews at the start of February and so we decided we want to switch to a monthly payment play in order to not commit to a full year.
 So on hold for their billing support for 1H because you cant cancel auto subscription on your own, you have to call them.
 Then they proceed to tell me that they dont have a monthly subscription, only monthly billing. Meaning I will still be committed for a year even if I pay monthly.
 So I essentially tell them that in that case I will have to cancel because I don&#x27;t want to commit for a year
 They respond with saying &quot;Go ahead cancel then because we only do yearly subscriptions&quot;.
 Honestly, hope they go under.

                              <span>I wrote a small GUI-based tool that uses the Windows Imaging Format (WIM) to create full backups of computer systems (operating system images) and then restore them.
 The application is hosted on GitHub, is open source, and is offered under the Apache 2.0 license.
 In addition, the repository includes an illustrated step-by-step guide to help get it up and running.
 Maybe someone can use the solution for their purposes as well - I would be happy. Have fun with it.
 Brief summary:
  
WIM backup always requires an external bootable media such as a USB flash drive.
 From this drive WinPE is booted to perform a backup or restore to or from an external medium (e.g. a USB hard drive).
 On the bootable USB flash drive the WinPE must be set up before (is documented illustrated in the readme).
 After completion of the respective operation, a status message is displayed whether the operation was successful or failed.
 After restoring a backup, you can boot normally from the destination drive.
 Both the backup and restore process are relatively simple (not &quot;rocket science&quot;).
 To set up the solution, you need about 30 minutes time in the best case due to the necessary downloads (e .g. ADK)

                              <span>My mother is getting on in the years, and liked to use TeamViewer to remotely use her desktop from a netbook in more comfortable seating. Some time in the last few months, TV decided to declare her commercial. I walked her through filling out the form and sending it in to get that lifted, they refuse and continue to disable her use.
 What alternatives are there that allow for free use?

                              <span>My boss forwards me an email from Autodesk showing our license was used to install AutoCAD on a computer that looks suspicious
 The computer name and license key used are listed and we don&#x27;t recognize the computer as it isn&#x27;t named the way we name our PCs.
 I email Autodesk support and get this response:
 &quot;I understand that you have gotten a verification/registration email for a computer that your organization does not recognize, my name is Dionne, and I am happy to help. However, I apologize, but we can&#x27;t see where the installations of products are made from. My apologies. 
 Best,
 Dionne-Danielle
 Autodesk Education Support&quot;
 So basically, they have no way to track where their software is installed . So they should not be relied on when they want you to pay for more licenses for more seats since they cant prove anything.
 Absolutely asinine.

                              <span>Is it worth giving the MSP life (+ a 30 min commute) a try for a year or two? 
 Some context: I like the relaxed pace of doing local in house, I can handle it well with my slight anxiety. But my current employer has 0 place to grow (after promising tons of place for growth when being hired), and after asking for a raise, I heard through the grapevine, HR/management was wanting to give my job to an offshore employee that makes $6/hr. Which they obviously didn&#x27;t when they realized that&#x27;s impossible. (I do their daily physical maintenance and support as well, basically 3 jobs in 1)
 This isn&#x27;t far from NYC btw. 
 Im always seeing horror stories in here about MSP&#x27;s but the money would be life improving. 
 Thanks in advance everyone

He has like 20 years of experience but was never supervised by anyone who had a clue.
 I&#x27;m often at a loss to even explain why his ideas are so bad because it&#x27;s stuff that normally you don&#x27;t have to sit and articulate.
 For example, I explained to him how group policy doesn&#x27;t work if people are at home but not on the VPN, so he asked if we can expose the domain controllers to the public internet. I said no, and he asked why not, and I then had to come up with reasons which he seemed skeptical of and kept coming up with workarounds. Most of us here know why this is a b…</span>

 We have 2 sites, and we need on-perm solution on both of them, connected via VPN.
 Its a small company with 4 phones on one site, and 2 on the other one. So I dont think a cloud based system is worth the cost over time. Please help if you have more experience.
 Should we go with LG Ericsson iPECS? I dont see any review on iPECS systems, on the other hand lots of talk around Grandstream, but I dont really know..

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I&#x27;m UK based.
 I&#x27;m in the fortunate position to have a decent job as a cloud engineer, working primarily on Azure and on premise infrastructure.
 I&#x27;ve been offered 2 roles, with a varying jump in salary. 
 Role 1: 90k but as a lead on a project.
 Role 2: 75k but with a support network around, and potentially a progression plan.
 ​
 I&#x27;m quite conflicted as to what to do. I&#x27;m confident in my own abilities and like the sound of more money, but would feel like I&#x27;d benefit from a support network around me. 
 What would you guys do?

                              <span>Looking for advice on Mitel VOIP appliances. Recently joined the business and there is a Mitel VOIP appliance in play for the usual VOIP business requirements. Took a look at the setup and at first glance there is some good practice: the VOIP is hosted on linux servers sitting in their own VLAN segmented from the rest of the network. The only public facing server is the Mitel&#x27;s conference bridge suite. 
 But there is something i dont understand cause i lack experience with this VOIP software - 1) the controller is being hosted on a Windows OS, iirc its supposed to be on Linux boxes, 2) the devices are domain joined - so i assume the creds of our admins when they are logging in and out of the Windows OS VOIP controller, will be leaving their creds behind in memory no? Or even a LSASS dump could result in compromise of any domain admins that have administered the Mitel suite in the separate VLAN? Am I panicking over nothing here?
 Seems kind of obvious to me that eventually someone will pop the internet-facing conference bridge, move to the Windows OS controller server in the same VLAN, and then dump creds until they find one that can break them out of the VOIP VLAN and get into the rest of the network. 
 Any thoughts?
 Should the Mitel VOIP stuff be domain joined? 
 Should any of the VOIP VMs be a Windows OS?
 Is this setup as vulnerable as i feel it is?

                              <span>Hello,
 I would like to setup a personal lab for PowerShell practice/testing, which I can&#x27;t do at work, and for which I can&#x27;t accommodate the tin (or a VM) at home.
 Is there a facility where I can have a suitably isolated hosted VM as if an &quot;on prem&quot; DC with AD services, which I can then sync with a Tenancy in AAD/365? 
 I could just buy a vanity domain + DNS hosting, a hosted VM with Windows Server Licence, link to a Tenancy, and go from there - but even for just a half-dozen dummy users with an E1 or two thrown in, my test bed is costing a sizeable chunk of salary.
 Conversely, though, I recognise any hosting is going to incur some cost, and that&#x27;s &quot;fine&quot;.
 Any suggestions please?

 Any ideas?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 yesterday at around 3pm the our Hyper-V server started running hot and the fans were on full blast. Due to the exchange being there etc. I couldn&#x27;t restart it before 9pm from home.
 Today at 7am I arrived in the server room and it was super hot (temps said 30 degrees) so I remoted in, powered it off and unplugged it.
 I then carried up a mobile a/c and turned it on to 17 degrees, the a/c inside the server room at 18 degrees (both on high) and turned it on again.
 It&#x27;s now 12am, and the fans still run at 100%, Hyper-V manager doesn&#x27;t show any significant VM load (around 2% CPU max.).
 What could the issue be? I opened the door so cold air gets in from the floor, and the a/c&#x27;s are still running. The fans should start powering down once the room cools down, no? 
 How come it still runs at a 100% even though it&#x27;s significantly cooler there now?

 I want to use LDAPs.
 Is it enough to install the root certificate or do I also need to have the intermediate root ca in the certificate store? (On the server that does the LDAP queries).
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 I have a SAN with a reported warning on the compact flash of one of the controllers. 
 The spare part shoud be the code 768079-001; however I cannot find it here, only shipped from USA or something.
 So, my question is, can I use a random-industrial-grade CompactFlash or the HP one is needed? And second question, can I use a bigger one? the 16GB is 5 times cheaper than the 4GB for example.
 Obviously I&#x27;m only looking at industrial grade high level CFs, not the cheap 10$ ones for cameras

                              <span>HI all,
 ​
 Looking for genuine opinions whether Microsoft Unified Support is bringing you value for money if you are using it.
 Yes it is quite pricey, but we are going all in in Azure and 365 and have struggled with getting good quality support from partners so are looking for alternatives.
 Most times we get support from MS, the initial engagement is problematic, but once I start having conversations (moaning...) with our MS account managers and they escalate the incidents to the right person, issues get resolved promptly. It appears that having Unified Support may well get you to the &#x27;right person&#x27; quickly. 
 ​
 Cheers

                              <span>Right now, at our small shop, if our router goes down, we lose all access to the network. It’s only happened during blackouts or a total loss of networking. Since everyones WFH, and I’m a distant remote, I have to wait for one of my coworkers to head into the office and start things back up. If my boss came down with HBBS (hit by bus syndrome), we would have an even harder time.
 What do you guys use?

                              <span>Hello friends, our wsus server, which we have been using for a while, started to have synchronization problems as seen in the photo. The first sync time was 12:12 at night. Although we did not make any settings changes regarding this, it started to not receive new updates. By the way, when we synced manually, it was getting new updates but showing its status &quot;fail&quot;. When I changed the sync time yesterday, I saw that new updates have arrived but its status still shows as &quot;fail&quot;. How can i solve this problem. I don&#x27;t want to reinstall wsus server. Is there anything I can do? Thanks in advance. Best wishes.

                              <span>What is everyone using for file servers these days? 
 100 user company on 365 business premium, hybrid environment, roughly 10TB of data, hosted on-prem right now.
 What is the easiest lift that can keep file/folder permission in place and allows easy mapping via GPO? I&#x27;m working on getting Intune/AutoPilot set up, testing how the enrollment process works in a hybrid environment now. Haven&#x27;t seen to many examples for hybrid specific in my research, but I digress. 
 Obviously we have a company OneDrive, I believe 1 TB for biz prem, I would think you could increase the capacity for a fee. Issue is permissions are not a one to one from my understanding. SharePoint is also an option but again, kind of a mess for management in my limited experience. And now there is Azure Files, that seems promising but being my first foray into Azure, seems pricey. 
 Ideally I don&#x27;t want to redo any permissions and need to have a reliable way to map drives for users. Curious to see what others have done. Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am in the process of revamping our service desk team to shift their mindset from reactive to tickets coming in the desk to proactive with a focus on ticket reduction through anticipating customer needs, automation to streamline/free You resources and delivering white glove service.
 I am curious to hear any success stories on areas you’ve focused and seen great success in addition to red flags/issues that came up with unintended consequences.
 Some of the areas of focus for 2023 are: - improve work from home experience and technology performance - conduct a monthly “check up” With all employees with at least 3 being video - revamp onboarding experience and shorten day 1 orientation timeframe - while supporting an issue, proactively review drivers/vulnerabilities/windows updates and address those before logging off.
 These are just a few examples of ways that we’re focused on prevention/proactive/mindset shift
 Any feedback on things that have/have not worked for you?
 Greatly appreciate the insight.

If you guys know a proven way to archive this please let me know, I think this would help a lot of people working as IT support around the world.

 Long story short been at this company for about 6+ months that’s just a one man show (aka me) and just feels like they are abusing it and not getting the help I need. Other positions I’ve had is either MSP or in healthcare where it’s a hit or miss when it comes to pay. 
 Been in a salary position for the last 3+ years but been offered a job where it’s more pay but it’s an hourly pay vs salary. Any suggestions on how to go about this?

                              <span>My 3 year old PockEthernet device has served me well over 3 years now. But this past week it will no longer do TDR cable length testing. It spins and spins like it is testing, but the fields are blank and no results ever show up. The wire map test still functions fine. So has my $180 cable tester has just became a basic wire map tester going forward? 
 Anybody experience this TDR testing issue with theirs? 
 The iOS app crashes more and more often as the phone gets updated, but I have learned to live with it so far.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I don&#x27;t really enjoy programming and writing code.
 I think there is a need for every engineer to do some basic scripting as it can save a significant amount of time. I can appreciate the skill, but I just haven&#x27;t been able to bring myself to enjoy it.
 Working with python and go have just felt awful for me, especially the xml, json and expect stuff.
 Shell scripting feels a bit more natural since I don&#x27;t spend time reinventing the wheel on a ton of functions and I can just pipe to other programs. It&#x27;s like a black box. I throw in some input and out comes what I need. It&#x27;s not without it&#x27;s issues either.
 Writing code with python and go feels more like this

 I&#x27;m curious what eventual upgrades I could do via optics/switch upgrade, but I&#x27;m not sure what the fastest BiDi speeds would be. 
 I see 25G-SFP28 exists so it looks like 25G is an option, but is there any higher or would it become QSFP at that point?

 I work in IT and would say i understand a good amount of networking, although its not my primary field (collab) - i know how BGP, RIP or OSPF work, the difference between distance vector and link state routing protocols, bla bla, CCNA&amp;CCNP covered all that. But when it comes to WAN routing i feel like a toddler. I have colleagues who work with SD-WAN and i dont understand a lot. I can understand the concept of each hop just looking for the best route individually, which might not always be the best route, which gave birth to the VPN ads we all know.

 New IT Director wants me to &quot;Spin up a Guest Wi-Fi&quot;. They want this to be 100% isolated from the intranet. Our environment is relatively simple - We run SonicWall firewall for any external communication, with a L3 core switch for all internal routing. Server stacks on each floor for access. Ruckus with Virtual Smart Zone for the AP&#x27;s/controller. This is true for all (8) locations. Our uplink to the SonicWall is through VLAN 60, which is also our corporate Wi-Fi. All AP&#x27;s are untagged for VLAN 60, as is the SonicWall uplink. 
 They&#x27;re not looking to spend any money or add any new equipment for this task, and would like it done early next week. Its Friday, so about 2 working days. They would ideally like something ready for testing in about... an hour.

 The CCR2216 has 2x QSFP28 ports capable of 100Gbps, and 12x SFP28 ports capable of 25Gbps.
 The MS355-24 has 4x QSFP ports capable of 40 Gbps.
 What are my options for interconnecting these two devices? They&#x27;ll be on top of each other in a cabinet so DAC is an option. 
 Any help with this setup is greatly appreciated! Thank you.

                              <span>When I search through the logs. I see dropped traffic which mentions in the description that traffic was dropped between the source and destination but in the Rule Number/Name fields these are blank. I have a rule to allow said traffic and am curious what is going on here? Is there a legitimate reason for this type of behaviour?

                              <span>Hi guys, anyone have experience deploying transit routing on ACI. I&#x27;ve got two firewalls I am migrating to ACI as-is, problem is they are not in the same broadcast domain and will need a middle man to route their prefixes. The guide generally out there deals mostly with dynamic routing protocols. Does anyone have experience ddeployting L3out to L3out ? or has a pretty firm grasp of how it is deployed

I&#x27;m interested in looking at the Sophos appliances and it seems I can get a trial unit fairly easily, but with the uncertainty of the acquisition I&#x27;m not sure I&#x27;ll have a job for any length of time and I&#x27;m curious how long the trial periods on the Sophos are good for. Don&#x27;t want to rip out my existing setup only to have to do the same in 6-12 months, even if it is to learn a new tool in the process

 So, I have a bare metal server in the cloud running Proxmox. The server has a single NIC witha public IP. The VM connect to the network via bridges that has separate subnets (vmbr0, vmbr1 and so on)
 All VMs have Internet and networking working just fine. I have forwarded ports for RDP and SSH and can connect to them just fine from the outside, all made with simple iptables commands put /etc(netwrok/interfaces.
 One of these VMs is running a service that needs to send notifications to client devices (apps on PC or smartphone). These VM are running a website serving a particular service, behind a reverse proxy.
 This notifier software is difficult though. I&#x27;ve forwarded port 8081 on the host machine to the VMs port 80 (to bypass…</span>

                              <span>Hi All
 I have been tasked with upgrading the fleet of Office 365 Installs for 80~ Devices.
 These devices all are using office 365 2013 Pro Plus Im needing to upgrade them all to Pro plus 2019.
  
I have generated an installer and an xml file from config.office.com. 
 I have downloaded all the relevant files with the /download switch in the batch file
  
Im having some issues when it comes to trying to install
  
My install O365.bat file is located in \\DC\netlogon\Office Deployment Upgrade: https://imgur.com/a/MKfK17F I have the @pushd and @popd in this batch file becuase the file is in a network location. It was the only way I could allow this file to be ran on an end user machine
 When I run this file I get an error message around the files not being able to be downloaded: https://imgur.com/a/Ouw61rt
  
Im also needing to figure out how to push this batch file once and only once so it only uninstalls 2013 and upgrades once. Wether I use PDQ or a one time scheduled task im not sure. 
 I have been at this for days and im yet to figure it out
 If anyone can assist that would be great
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi;
 I&#x27;m a technical trainer with Atlanta transit. Before I was a trainer, I was a technician that maintained the SCADA system, so I&#x27;m familiar with electronics, computers, and networking. I gained some certifications along the way (A+, Net+, Linux Essentials).
 I&#x27;m currently studying Python and Linux administration. I&#x27;m looking for a volunteer opportunity for Linux system administration, to apply what I know and learn more. Can anyone point me in the right direction? Thanks

                              <span>Are you ready for this nightmare story?
 I have a Virtual environment (VMWare, Microsoft) and lost everything on the SAN including VMs and backups. Data recovery is in the process but it will take weeks at best and I am not getting any high confidence from the data recovery team. I have an online backup of user data but no viable backup of the actual DC or any other servers that I can restore. I say that, but there is a remote possibility that I can restore my DC from 6 months ago when we upgraded from 2008 to 2022 and swapped roles, etc., however, that is looking like a pipe dream as well (this would be the 2008 server).
 It is a Hybrid Office 365 environment with on-prem DCs and Azure AD (free) for authentication and all. I am assuming that if I were to create everything from scratch (new Forest and DC) there is a high likelihood of all mailboxes getting affected as well because the on-prem SIDs and GUIDs and Object IDs would be different from what they were previously. Waiting for weeks isn&#x27;t happening but I need at least some domain functions back to survive the carnage.
 I am looking for some bright ideas to get out of this mess!!!!
 My terrible options at the moment are:
  
Create everything from scratch and deal with hybrid issues later
 Hope and try to restore the DC from 6 months ago and minimize the impact to only new users from that point on.
 Can Azure AD be the savior here? - Can the information in the cloud be used to spin up a DC in the cloud? - If that is possible, does this mean I am not fully cloud-based domain environment, or can I then also have an on-prem spun up later?
  
I am sure there are some bright minds out there to help navigate this mess.
 Thank you!!!!

                              <span>Almost a year ago, my manager let me know he was going to be moving to another team and my department director would like to promote me to my manager&#x27;s position. Nice! Over the following months this shifted to, &quot;we have to post the position and you&#x27;ll need to apply, but you&#x27;re our candidate of choice.&quot; Interviews were earlier this month and I didn&#x27;t make it past the first round of interviews. My director pulled me aside afterwards to say that I interviewed well, but he had decided to look for someone with more experience. It sucks but business can be that way, I&#x27;ll just keep my resume updated.
 ​
 Later, it was dropped that the new manager won&#x27;t be meeting with our team at any point during the interview process. This manager will also report to two directors; during my interview it became clear they had directly opposing ideas of what the new manager should achieve, (director 1 said it would be the new manger&#x27;s job to take on work from their team and say no to new work from director 2, director 2 said exactly the opposite), and it very much gave me &quot;divorced parents arguing through the kids&quot; vibes.
 ​
 After thinking about this for a bit, I never would entertain an offer like this if it had come from another organization. If I was applying for a manager role and couldn&#x27;t meet the team at least once and was expected to report to multiple directors with directly opposing expectations, I never would consider the role!
 ​
 While it sucks that I was strung along for so long, I&#x27;m grateful that it helped me see that this probably wasn&#x27;t a position I would be happy with, and that a healthy organization probably wouldn&#x27;t make these kinds of decisions.

                              <span>HR wants to check a users activity because they think they are not doing anything while working from home. Apparently they want to see user log in activity. I can easily do this in event viewer filtering by code 4648 but that would require me to be in the computer…
 We use connect wise so I can open a command prompt.. anyway to do it thru there?
 Note: I really hate doing these type of tickets I’ve only had to do things like this maybe 2-3 times in my 7 year IT career

                              <span>Hey all,
 I have one domain in the forest, and the domain currently has 4 Domain controllers. One DC is obviously holding the FSMO roles. I just noticed that the FSMO role holder is also a GC. Now in the past i&#x27;ve never paid any mind to this, and the domain seems fine... for years even. But Looking at the microsoft instructions for moving FSMO roles, they clearly state: &quot;Do not put the infrastructure Master FSMO role on a GC&quot;.
 Why? My domain seems to be running fine. Whats the difference between a DC that is not a Global Catalog, and one that isnt? Can it still be used the same way?
 I only have one DC at this particular site, if i switch off GC, will everything still function correctly?(Auth, Kerberos, etc).
 ​
 My other Domain controllers are also Global catalogs.

 We have some customizations that rely on the browser being synced to the corporate account. Extensions and PWAs aren&#x27;t present until the browser is synced. We want to delay those customizations until the user has logged into the browser.
 Anyone know a way, or have any ideas where I can start poking?

                              <span>If there&#x27;s a better subreddit for this let me know, but I&#x27;m having a lot of trouble and dealing with very poor documentation and hoping someone else has tried this. 
 I am primarily the video guy at an arts center, but since my venue went to NDI I have also become the defacto sysadmin for our dedicated video network. It&#x27;s not fancy - we have a Netgear M4250 managed switch driving the network, and then a bunch of CAT6 run through the walls to our endpoints. I&#x27;m trying to add wireless for easier troubleshooting and access to the GUIs for my devices. I thought this would be easy (lol). That&#x27;s the context, now here&#x27;s the problem:
 I have installed the Ubiquiti Unifi Network application on my Windows 10 laptop, plugged both the laptop and the U6-LR into the switch (PoE+ capable), and am trying to &quot;adopt&quot; it to my Unifi network on the Windows app. That&#x27;s what the documentation covers. However, the adoption always fails, then asks me to &quot;enter the device credentials that were set on the previously installed location under network device ssh authentication.&quot; Except that I didn&#x27;t set any of that - this thing is brand new out of the box. I press the &quot;forget&quot; button, which says &quot;the device will be restored to facotry settings&quot;. That sounds like exactly what I need, but in practice it just starts this loop over again. Same if I hit the hardware reset button. Adoption failed.
 I&#x27;m stumped. Does anybody have any idea what I&#x27;m doing wrong?

                              <span>Our company has made some changes to tighten what messages can and cannot come through. We have added DMaRC and DKIM as one should. 
 Our users have recently been receiving undeliverable messages stating they are the sender and recipient. Mainly because of the way the mail flow rule is setup against dmarc failures. 
 Clearly the messages are phishing. I’m wondering the best way we could handle these? I was thinking I just create a mail flow rule to say if anyone inside the organization receives a message with the body text matching what the custom NDR rule outputs to just drop the message. 
 Thoughts?

                              <span>I understand that overall solution may not be optimal however, hope to be given an advice how to configure it with the limited resources that are already in place.
 There is a situation that has to be resolved:
 In AD there is a file server srv002 with shared folders Folder1, Folder2, etc.
 The server is running out of space. It was decided to add another server srv003 which has sufficient disk space and use DFS to &#x27;distribute&#x27; data between the servers.
 The other intention is not to change paths to which users have got used.
 Is that all possible?
 I am testing with one of the shared folders that exists and cannot get the same namespace...
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m pretty new in my role. Graduated with a year of work experience in IT and went straight into systems administration, have been doing it for almost 2 months. But god it feels so much longer than that. I&#x27;m also the only IT person at an organisation with ~250 people.
 A lot of people lack basic IT skills, which is totally fine, that&#x27;s why we have IT people. Except they get so mad when I ask them to make sure their username/password is correct, or if their cable is in properly or if they&#x27;re trying to log into the right platform. People don&#x27;t understand resolving IT issues isn&#x27;t always instantaneous and sometimes we need to wait for equipment to be delivered. It seems that I&#x27;m often expected to resolve everything Right Now and people get frustrated and upset when that doesn&#x27;t happen. 
 It&#x27;s a bit overwhelming to be honest, and I&#x27;m still trying to wrap my head around everything. I got 3 day of training before the last sysadmin left. I&#x27;m not sure how you guys deal with people who are rude/impatient/irritated. I also get frustrated at the bad communication and poor common sense. Anyone got any advice for this?

                              <span>Hello.
 I have a cheap dell t310 with hba sas card and 16gb ram with a zfs1 pool on n°4 sas HD 4tb 7200 rpm each without compression.
 I use proxmox on dell perc raid with 4ssd raid5 hardware managed, where I run some VM and container saved inside the SSD lvm raid and the zfs pool is only for my works files storage with samba with a 2gbps network bonding.
 Also I have an unused 4 old 10k sas disk of 250gb each.
 My question is: - the zfs1 pool has 3X read speed gain but no write speed gain.
 Want to have the sense to install one small sas 10k as a log disk for zfs to speed up write operations?
 If yes, I can work only with a LOG disk or if I add a log also I need to add a cache disk?
 Really thank you

                              <span>Does anyone have a recommendation for a software package for purchase order management. I do not require something complex.
 The kind of functionality I need is basically a database of what orders and invoices we have, but then some form of dashboard showing which ones are coming up for review/renewal. I did my research and came across Tradogram. Has anyone ever used them before?

                              <span>First off; yes, SMBv1 bad. Not my decision.
 I hope the hive mind has some input on this.
 We have a legacy application that uses SMBv1. We have recently stood up a new site in AD with a new domain controller. Devices in this site are unable to open the SMB share via \\hostname, but are able to connect via \\IP.-.add.ress.
 Wireshark shows me &quot; KRB5KDC_ERR_ETYPE_NOSUPP &quot;, but zero configuration changes between the devices in site A and site B. I&#x27;ve literally moved VM&#x27;s from one site to another and have it work in A but not B).
 Site A:
  
DC running server 2019
 XP SMBv1 share
 Clients can connect to SMB share
  
Site B:
  
DC running server 2022
 clients cannot connect to SMB share
  
​
 As a test, I&#x27;ve associated the subnets of Site B with site A in AD sites &amp; services. After a reboot, the devices are able to connect to the SMB share.
 So that leads me to believe there&#x27;s an issue with the DC in site B, but I&#x27;m unsure what/where.
 ​
 Any tips would be very welcome!

                              <span>Hey there!
 I am a junior Sysadmin for a NGO and we are planning to upgrade our network infrastructure.
 We are using D-Link managed switches (layer 3 functionallities for backbone, access layer 2, ..) and I was looking for good, sustainable alternatives. The D-Link swiches are doing their job but they aren´t that good to handle for my favour.
 While looking up some alternatives I´ve noticed that I dont know that much about the differences between switches from different manufactures.
 Since I´m rarely active in this Community I though I just ask you and maybe join the discussion.
 Maybe some of you could list their favourite piece of hardware they love working with and shortly state why? :)
 It would be nice to get some advice for middleclass price options aswell.
 ​
 Thank you in advance for you contibution!

                              <span>I started working in my first IT job and I&#x27;ve been working in a very high performing team. 
 I&#x27;m a noob, straight out of Uni and doesn&#x27;t really have any experience. Work has been getting hectic lately and there is a good chance that I might get fired/ let go.
 TBH I&#x27;m mentally exhausted as well. It&#x27;s just everyone is really smart and I feel like I&#x27;m being a dead weight. 
 My boss/manager is a really kind person. They really want me to succeed and encourage me a lot. But I feel like it&#x27;s a bit too late for that. There is a pretty good chance that I might be let go due to my performance. 
 I was wondering that, how bad would it look if I get fired from my very first IT job?
 Considering the situation, how can I make it as easy as possible for everyone.?
 Any advice or help would be appropriated.

                              <span>Hello guys, while doing my project for work, a few questions arose, and will be more than happy to get some information or useful tips from people with experience with the technologies or in the field! :) 
 The SOAR we are going to use is Shuffle.
 What can be achieved with those integrations and what are the differences? How do those systems work together in the SOC environment? 
 Are the cases updated automatically in TheHive with the information from MISP/Cortex or should they be configured to be updated automatically if certain conditions are matched with a SOAR?
 Is it a good practice to use both MISP and Cortex?

                              <span>I am trying to enable ADFS on a vCenter but I get this error:
 “com.vmware.vcenter.trustmanagement.impl.InvalidArgumentException: java.io.IOException: Server returned HTTP response code: 503 for URL: http://localhost:1080/external-vecs/http1/XXX-XXX-adfsservername.XXX.local/443/adfs/.well-known/openid-configuration”
 I ensured that the ADFS is working via this (internal) link: https://xxxadfsservernamexxx.local/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.aspx
 I believe this is an issue with the certificate. That is because during trial and error I got different errors related with the certificate. Like: &quot;Error occurred while adding trusted root certificates&quot;&quot;com.vmware.vapi.std.errors.Error&quot; &quot;Certificate bearing subject&quot;&quot;is not a valid CA certificate&quot;&quot;Please retry with a valid certificate chain&quot;.
 We have a CA in the domain and newly created Windows 2022 ADFS server. 
 I have followed the steps in this link: https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/78029
 But there is no clear instructions on what certificate to export and import or how to generate one or whatsoever. I am missing this part. Do I need to get a certificate from ADFS server? From the CA server? What format? How to export? What is a chain? Any idea on how to handle this?

                              <span>Yes, I will post this in the IT Careers subreddit as well, but I feel like this sub has helped me incredibly and I greatly respect the opinions of us folk who are in the trenches daily.
 I took a position as a entry level help desk technician at an MSP a few years ago with no experience. I was stagnant in my previous line of work and wanted to try something new (I’m in my mid 30s). In a few years, I’ve learned a LOT, obtained the triad of CompTIA certs, VMware cert, CCNA, and some Azure certs. I assist in managing our VIP clients, and have been promoted 4 times to get near the top of the food chain on the help desk (about 50 of us).
 I love the type of work I do and it just clicks for me, but a huge downside for me is OT. I understand there is OT for every position out there. That’s part and parcel of work. But the daily 1-3 hours (and weekends) of maintenance and troubleshooting the inevitable issues that arise from that work each night is just something I will not continue to do. Give me 40-42 hours a week. Take your money. I want the time off, away from the office. I’m not going to spend 12 hours a day working when I have a wife and 2 kids at home. It’s just too much, I’m burnt out quickly, and I can’t give my family my full, undivided attention they deserve on a daily basis.
 Are there any options out there for me that I can work my way to that is a more traditional “9-5” job in the IT world? When I’m done for the day, I want to leave my work at work. Obviously a sysadmin role at a company is out of the question. Am I more suited for a solutions role or pre sales? Sales? Account management? I’ve only been in the industry for 5 years so I’m fairly new to what options may even be available for me, if any. So I’m at the point where I need to decide if another career move may be needed. 
 Any advice at all would be appreciated!

 Currently using Microsoft 365 Business Premium. 
 We need it so if a laptop leaves the building WiFi it stops working, or if they try to logon via a different device from a different wan IP it doesn&#x27;t work etc.
 Thanks in Advanced!

                              <span>Long story short, i&#x27;m looking for mRemoteNG or Mobaxterm or such but without the putty backend. I&#x27;ve moved to openssh ever since it&#x27;s been included in Windows. VSCode uses my SSH Config and it would be great, if there where a terminal or session manager that would as well.
 I don&#x27;t need tons of features. Saving sessions would be enough. Doesn&#x27;t even need Credential management, as that&#x27;s done through ssh config and keys.
 Is there anything for windows that doesn&#x27;t rely on putty?

                              <span>Hello all! As the title suggests ive been tasked to look for a self-service tool that provides temporary local admin rights. Right now all of our users have local admin rights on their work devices which is a security risk we would like to mitigate.
 Points to consider are:
  
straight forward administration of the tool
 the tool should be easy to understand for the user
 there should be a way to evaluate who / when / how long someone requsted local admin rights
 it should be possible to determine the duration of the requested admin rights
 Company of about 200 - 300 users
 We are using Microsoft 365 E3
  
Questions we asked ourselves are:
  
Why do coworkers actually need local admin rights?
 can the tool / software be automatically be updated with our images without admin rights?
 can devicedrivers still be installed with manufacturer tools like Dell SupportAssist?
  
As it stands right now in my research on the subject i stumbled upon the tool EAM (Emergency Admin Manager) from dynasys, which looks kind of promising.
 I was curious if any of you have a useful suggestion or better solution to my problem at hand (im still fairly inexperienced and just started my first job)
 im grateful for any help, thank you very much!

 Using the latest build of Purple Knight by Semperis, I&#x27;m unable to view/save the PDF report. It seems that the new build is unable to generate the PDF file, I always get a message &quot;Failed to save security assessment report. Internal Error.&quot; or &quot;Failed to save security assessment report - Object reference not set to an instance of an object&quot;.
 The previous build was working correctly on the same machine.
 Anyone with the same issue?

                              <span>Hi all Got a call this morning from a prospective customer who is in pretty bad shape. 
 Ransomware&#x27;d, majority of data lost and no backups. They switched off all on-prem domain controllers soon as one of their techs noticed weird behaviour.
 Their only saving grace are two domain controllers running in Azure, showing no signs of infection and pretty segregated away from their on-premise environment and adequately backed up.
 I&#x27;ve been brought in as a secondary pair of eyes to relieve the pain on the lone tech on the ground.
 I&#x27;d be grateful if you could validate our approach below and any suggestions and pointers you could provide to work around any dangers you may see.
 Approach I&#x27;m thinking of taking is, once we&#x27;re 100% the DCs in the cloud are unimpacted
  
Build clean network
 
Perform authoritative restore of the dc in the cloud into a new on-premise virtual machine
 
Install AD and configure roles onto the new VM
 
Restore system state data from the backup to new VM using Windows Backup Utility
 
Boot new VM into DRSM and run ntdsutil command to start Directory Services Utility
 
Use authoritative restore sub-command to mark relevant objects as authoritative
 
Commit, restart
 
Perform deep AD Health Check
 
 In terms of FSMO roles - unfortunately they were all on one of the on-prem domain controllers, now powered down - would this simply be a case of seizing the roles once I&#x27;ve configured the new on-prem DC properly?

                              <span>Hi Fellow IT-people.
 I&#x27;ve been working at an MSP but as a consultant for a sister company that sells ERP. My job is solving technical issues (most of the time small network probs or an update that gets stuck), and some internal helpdesk.
 I&#x27;ve been offered a job at a place for internal IT with a 33.3% raise in pay. When i offered my dismissal HR replied kinda cold, no counteroffer what so ever.
 Now one day before i leave i got an offer with a raise of 50% with a car in the package.
 I&#x27;m at a crossroads here and i was hoping I would get some opinions on what i should do.
 Help?

                              <span>Hey all, 
 For reasons I won’t go into, I’m in a need to setup a M365 subscription (E3 Enterprise, likely with the security addons on later) pretty quickly for a business which will host ~1000 users. 
 For these subscriptions, I need to contact the Microsoft sales team. I’ve done this but they’ll take a few days to get back to me (which over Christmas will likely take a bit longer)
 https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/enterprise/e3?activetab&#x3D;pivot%3aoverviewtab
 Are there any other ways of spinning up this tenant without engaging a human?
 I’ve noticed E3 Business subscriptions can be done directly from the portal. Can I just sign up for this and then upgrade? Or is this going to cause issues later?
 https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/enterprise/office-365-e3?activetab&#x3D;pivot%3aoverviewtab
 Any other options appreciated :)

                              <span>We&#x27;re a fairly small shop. Staffed mostly by young developers. We like to have fun when we can, in the past this was done by playing URT on slow days or before holidays. In the last two years there&#x27;s been a lot of turnover and current folks just aren&#x27;t into it damn kids.
 So after sneakily gathering intel for the last two months I&#x27;ve gathered that they ALL like to play minecraft. Surprise!
 So, tomorrow as a end of the year gift the company will be playing a Ya-dead-ya-dead minecraft game in a server I spent today building. We&#x27;re confident most employees have already purchased the game but I&#x27;ve gotten an approved PO to purchase a personal copy for any employee who doesn&#x27;t so they can join in, and it&#x27;s theirs. Ties to their personal accounts. 
 I spent the day preparing a full java minecraft package, to deploy at 11:59pm tonight to all systems, and have a custom message that will be pushed at 10am directing users play some minecraft and join xyz server. 
 Once they join everyone will start at a specified point with some messages to read regarding the &quot;game&quot;. They&#x27;ll have the entier day to build the most elaborate home + an attempt to reach &quot;the end&quot;. Most likely nobody will get there as its hardcore. Also, if you die you&#x27;re dead. They&#x27;ve all been provided a named box with the same supplies to help them get started, food and a map.
 Its not much but I&#x27;m really happy I was able to get this approved and am able to give the company a few hours of fun before the holidays.
 Any ideas on change to the theme of the game for more fun? I thought YDYD would lead to good braging rights theme. We do have some sales, Admin, and HR folks but they&#x27;re already all GONE for the holiday. It&#x27;s literally just a bunch of very young devs and myself for tomorrow.

                              <span>I am looking out for an open-source L4 load-balancer for a personal project which can support SCTP protocol. I do have some development expertise and can fill in some missing bits if necessary. After reading some blogs, so far found a project which utilizes eBPF called loxilb. Any other suggestions ?

                              <span>What are some of the most notoriously difficult issues to troubleshoot? Like if you knew this issue manifested on someone or anyone’s network, you’d expect it to take 3-6 months for the network team to actually resolve the issue, if they’re damn good. You’d expect it to be a forever issue if they’re average.

 A few more details below:
  
address space is currently /28 from one provider (just peering address for other)
 Two CERs, Two firewalls (HA or Active-Active still to be determined) One collapsed core switch (multiple access layer switches) 
 All participating in OSPF (eBGP and IBGP at CERs)
 
 Only receiving default route from both providers

 So i set up a dhcp relay in my stormshield, specify the LAN1 server and the interfaces that&#x27;s im listening to.
 But my LAN2 isn&#x27;t getting any IP. I ran a tcpdump on my stormshield and i can see the DHCP DISCOVER frames being relayed to my server but he is not responding to theses DISCOVER, can you guys help me understand ?
 Thanks :)
 BTW i&#x27;m on hyperV

                              <span>Hi,
 we are running a OLD fileserver (Windows Server 2012R2) with a really big multiple data-disk (D:\ , E:\, G:\, H:\ ,J:\ , M:\) of round about 6,5 TB. This server is virtualized by VMware. We will migrate my old file server to Windows Server 2022. My question is :if I put in different VLANs for each file server , will there be any performance issues? 
 We have Checkpoint FW. Also , We have 10G network infrastructure. (Cisco Nexus Switch)
 Thanks,

                              <span>First I am just a dumb electrician, who recently had to run fiber between two switches. The fiber tested good between the two switches, but the vendor is saying the fiber is no good, because the switches will not communicate with each other, but will show activity if you connect to GBIC ports together via short patch on the same switch. What am I missing, and yes I did swap the tx and rx on the patch cable just in case it was crossed somewhere.

                              <span>I have the below topology on GNS3, where each rectangle represents a different VLAN. Now I want a NAT scheme that steers packets from VLAN1 from one connection, while packets from VLANs 2 to 6 are steered through a different connection than VLAN. Does anyone have any ideas on how I can implement this?
 Note: The clouds there are not doing anything they are just part of an attempt.

                              <span>From what I know and can tell, 400 gigabit is 50 gigabytes per second. PCIE 4.0 X16 can only do 32 gigabyte per second. So how do 400 gigabit NICs achieve full speed? Can they even? Or is 400 not symmetrical? Just total? I’m really curious and I haven’t been able to find an answer

                              <span>I have two servers with their own 10gb NICs installed and I&#x27;m trying to get an iperf test to make sure all looks good. The issue is that I can&#x27;t make the connection. I&#x27;m using openmediavault as my server and in it I&#x27;ve configured the main port of each NIC with it&#x27;s own IP.
 Server 1 NIC IP &#x3D; 172.16.61.8 as a bridge, netmask 255.255.255.252
 Server 2 NIC IP &#x3D; 172.16.61.9 as a bridge, netmask 255.255.255.252
 ​
 On server 1 I&#x27;m running this on iperf:
 iperf3 -s -B 172.16.61.9
 ​
 On server 2 as the client:
 iperf3 -c 172.16.61.9 -B 172.16.61.8
 ​
 But when I run this it just hangs for 2 minutes and then says &#x27;iperf3: error - unable to send control message: Bad file descriptor&#x27;
 ​
 What am I missing here? I&#x27;m calling the IP for the server&#x27;s 10gb nic and establishing my local server&#x27;s 10Gb IP as well but just not making a connection

                              <span>Guys, I’ve searched everywhere and couldn’t find a working solution. Here’s my quest. 
 I have a device connected to network 1 which uses mDNS for auto discovery. These network attached devices are only accessible by its software application. 
 I need to be able to VPN into network 1 and access the network devices via their software.
 What I’ve done so far; 
 I’ve got a L2TP vpn to work between the two and I see the device via IP. But can’t access the device since the proprietary software doesn’t see it. (mDNS / Bonjour doesn’t transfer over VPN)
 What are my options here ? How can I make it work. Do I need any specific hardware ? 
 Thanks

 Concerning fiber links especially Fiber To The Home GPON designs. It is common to have 20 KM SFPs at each end of a fiber link. If the fiber link is more than 20 KM and all of the transmit and receive light levels are within spec, what kind of issues will this cause? 
 Some fiber links have a 60 KM SFP on one end and a 20 KM SFP on the other end. I&#x27;m not sure what issues this will cause either assuming all of the transmit and receive light levels are within spec.
 I appreciate any help.

 If this is not right, how do I turn them back to capwap AP&#x27;s? The guide says to just issue ap-type capwap but that command isn&#x27;t available. I also tried factory resetting but it keeps booting to the EWC partition.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve lost the connection between my middle school and primary building,. thankfully we are Xmas break😁
 The switch at the middle school is a Cisco and the switch at the primary building is an old 3com
 When looking at at the Cisco it alerted me with
 %SPANTREE-2-PVSTSIM_FAIL: Blocking root port Te1/0/43: Inconsitent inferior PVST BPDU received on VLAN 7, claiming root 32775:00a5.bf25.d800
 The config on te1/0/43 is
 Switchport trunk Spanning-tree portfast Description link to CV
 On the 3com the config is
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/24
 stp edged-port enable
 port link-type trunk undo port trunk permit vlan 1
 port trunk permit vlan 7 to 8 70 128 157 200
 port trunk pvid vlan 305
 undo jumboframe enable
 description &quot;Uplink to MS 1G&quot;
 I&#x27;m not sure where to begin troubleshooting as this has.never been an issue before. What am I missing?
 Apologies for formatting I&#x27;m on my phone.

 I&#x27;m looking for community opinion and experience related to the 6wind products in general, particularly with 6wind vsr solutions.
 I&#x27;ve been testing it pretty intensively and already have some understanding. However, it would be nice if anybody can share their experience with the company and its products.
 For now, my specific case is a branch VPN router, but I have a few more places where they might fit, just lack external information and have to stick to their corporate website only.

                              <span>How important is it to shape / rate limit the interface of a WAN connection to the actual bandwidth?
 Example: I have a 200Mbps L2 circuit plugged in to a 1Gb port on an Arista switch. There&#x27;s a bunch of output discards and I found myself wondering if it best practice (or would even make a difference) to shape the interface down to 200000Kbps. I attempted to do this as a test (rate shape 200000 kbps) and it didn&#x27;t change the incrementing output discards (but I&#x27;m fairly certain I&#x27;ve still read this as best practice before).
 Any guidance on this one appreciated. Thank you!
 [EDIT]: I&#x27;m also (now) fairly certain my config was wrong as rate shape doesn&#x27;t do anything without QoS queues defined, but I&#x27;m still curious about the best practice aspect. I believe this is how I&#x27;d do it on Arista (?): Rate Limit on Arista switch

                              <span>I am helping a friend out who has almost exclusively extreme switches. I work mostly in Cisco and Aruba. 
 They are running ExtremeXOS version 21.1.3.7. Someone for the love of god tell me how to see the mac address table. I need to see if a device&#x27;s mac address is on one of the ports and I can not figure this out for the life of me.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have something like this across 2 data centres (green is Site A, yellow is Site B): https://i.imgur.com/nKKrVnN.png . The 2x2 ToR switches are OS10, and I&#x27;m new to them. 
 Each site has its own edge so internet bound traffic is always directed from the 2 switches to their respective local firewall as their default g/w. 
 Is it then possible to configure the ToR switches to monitor an internet IP and if it is down, change their default gateway? 
 Take for instance the green side. I want 172.30.0.11 and 172.30.0.12 to monitor an internet ip (say 8.8.8.8), and if its unreachable, change its default gw to 172.30.0.4 ? 
 Thanks for any tips.

                              <span>So our network is typically a 48 port access switch run back to the core stack via 2 network runs, we have a situation where we are expanding one of our locations to have a 2nd 48 port switch. would it make more sense to break up the bonded run, and do single runs to each switch or leave it and trunk the vlans through one acces switch to the next. I feel it really does not matter all that much but I was just checking what people typically do here.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m looking for a good tiny vpn device. I have a paloalto fw for the main site and a few fortinets for some of the sites with 15+ users. Now I&#x27;ve got 3 or 4 sites where their will only be 1 device. To send data in over vpn, no internet access otherwise, ideally able to do aes256bit encryption.. ikev2/ipsec.. but be able to handle a more secure connection if needed. Like 512bit.. Only need to cat 5 ports one for the internet and one for the pc.
 And as an fyi theirs a space contraint, ideally the size of a micropc, and under $600.

                              <span>Hey all!
 A problem i cant wrap my head around arose. How can i just receive a signal from a CWDM4 transceiver?
 I have one pair that&#x27;s linked between two routers, i&#x27;ve put an tap/splitter into the the lines, but i need to receive this signal. When hooking it up to the rx port of another CWDM4 transceiver all i get is a sad day :(
 ​
 Edit: Just to clarify i have the tx from each of the transceivers tapped, and im trying to input this into the rx of another cwdm4 to see what i am receiving. The problem is that i&#x27;m not getting anything from the transceiver even though i have great signal strength.
 ​
 Any tips for me?
 Eternal gratitude will be given to those who can help me.
 Thanks all!

 I am currently working on implementing my own Fail2Ban for windows. I haven&#x27;t been able to find where I can find the failed login logs for OpenSSH. 
 When I tried to use the Event Viewer I had no success, because it only shows that there was an &quot;Audit Failure&quot; but not the Source Network Address. 
 Does anyone know how to get the failed login attempts for OpenSSH on Windows?

 Is there anything I’m missing?
 I’d like to setup a juniper, Cisco, hell even a Palo Alto with built in 5G backup instead of LTE. Does this exist yet? This is for a work from home deployment. I’ve found consumer grade routers that support this but I’d prefer to go pro. Ideally I’d like a docsis 3 module and 5G backup, but the 5G is most important.

                              <span>Looks like the ASR1001X has been replaced by the C8500 series. 
 I&#x27;m just looking at the Cisco build tool and as usual I&#x27;m confused by it. 
 I know you have to order the DNA licensing but don&#x27;t have to renew it but what I can&#x27;t see is if you don&#x27;t renew are you then on a reduced bandwidth? 
 I need the C8500-8S4X to have 10Gb available throughput and looking at the license options it has the below: 
 DNA-P-T3-A-3Y &#x3D; Cisco DNA Advantage On-Prem Lic 3Y - upto 10G (Aggr, 20G) 
 If I get this and it expires after 3 years will it then reduce the router down to it&#x27;s base throughput whatever that may be? 
 Or am I looking at this wrong and the C8500 series isn&#x27;t license locked anyway?

 In my head the OSI model is the ideal way.. the &quot;model&quot; used for systems communicate with each other.
 A basic set of protocols used when transferring data. 
 I feel like I am not grasping it very well. Am I right or wrong?

 why i need set route-redistribution with distribute a route received ebgp to announce to ebgp?

                              <span>I&#x27;ll try and keep this brief.
 We have a new 1GB DIA circuit from Zayo in the datacenter we&#x27;re colocating in. The datacenter tech ran a SMF jumper from the Zayo handoff to our cabinet where for the time being I have it going to a 1.25GB SPF module in an EdgeRouter X SFP.
 That&#x27;s it. Simple and sweet, but I&#x27;m only getting aprx 150-180Mb down, 300-400Mb up speeds. That&#x27;s testing from every major speed test website, as well as running Iperf to the public 10Gb servers. Also tried testing directly from the router itself using Ubiquiti&#x27;s speed test built in UISP. Same every time.
 I tried both setting the router up as a L3 gateway, and as a L2 switch. Same results.
 Naturally Zayo refuses to even consider the problem may be on their end.
 Any suggestions?

 ​
 Anyone have any contacts with Google or know if there&#x27;s a possible way to recover, not getting too far with live chat and i was in the hospital during the suspensions/deletions and didn&#x27;t know about this..

 Thanks so much!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been with the same company for 16 years. 17 in July. We&#x27;ve had some rough times of course. 2023 is going to be stupid though. We&#x27;ve been warned. No raises. OK. It&#x27;s only been 2% for several years anyway. So not great. My reviews are exceeds to all of you managers. So I&#x27;m not just disgruntled. I&#x27;m pretty good at what I do. So what else is going to suck? We have to do after-hours support every three weeks for a full week. They are not going to pay us though. We have to volunteer. Now, in IT we&#x27;ve all canceled family vacations and lost money on plane tickets, yada yada.. It&#x27;s not just happening to me personally, it&#x27;s my team. My direct manager is great, and so is my IT director. They are very good human beings. I can&#x27;t stress that enough. Mr. Rogers&#x27;s territory nice. &quot;Good people&quot; if you&#x27;re from the American Midwest. You know what that term means.
 I got a Teams call today from HR. I had used the F word in an email to my wife on 19 Dec 2023 at 0759 EST. I have a company phone and I had used a company phone to say the F-word in an email. OK fine. I violated company policy. I will endeavor to be mindful in the future when using my mobile phone, not to say the F-word or any other word that people find offensive. That list gets updated yearly. 
 I said to the HR rep &quot; you called to chew me out about email usage, but a multi-billion dollar company is refusing to pay the IT department overtime when we actually work overtime? Can you see why I might be upset? You are not solving problems, you&#x27;re just making problems up. You never just say thank you to us&quot;. The HR rep said, &quot;Well, I guess you&#x27;re thanked with a paycheck&quot;. 
 For the first time in 16.5 years, I started updating my resume. I can&#x27;t continue to &quot;volunteer&quot;.

                              <span>Hi fellow redditors,
 About 11 months ago i started my first job in IT with a team of 3 other employees, within 6 months they all left the company and i was left alone with the basic knowledge of the infrastructure.. only a small amount was documentated.
 Everyone in the office expects me to know every system because they think i know everything.
 My contract is almost ending and i have a job interview tomorrow morning, but i have no clue how to tell my current employee i want to leave, since when im gone there is basically noone for IT..
 Could anyone give some advice on how to handle this or has been in the same situation?
 Thanks alot, ive learned alot from you guys!

                              <span>Sorry if this was posted already. Just got this e-mail from Rapid7:
 Beginning December 20, 2022, Rapid7 has responded to an increase in the number of Microsoft Exchange server compromises. The attacks appear to chain CVE-2022-41080 and CVE-2022-41082 together to bypass previously recommended URL rewrite mitigations that Microsoft provided for ProxyNotShell. Threat actors are using this to deploy ransomware. 
 Rapid7 recommends that organizations who have yet to install the Exchange update (KB5019758) from November 2022 should do so immediately and investigate systems for indicators of compromise. Do not rely on the rewrite mitigations for protection. 
 Customers already have coverage to assist in assessing exposure to and detecting exploitation of this threat: 
 ​
  
InsightVM and Nexpose: InsightVM and Nexpose added checks for CVE-2022-41080 and CVE-2022-41082 on November 8, 2022.
 InsightIDR: InsightIDR customers can look for the alerting of 8 rules listed in our blog post.

                              <span>So this morning I was alerted by some users to a suspicious email. I figured it was yet another phish that made it through filters. But no.
 A worker for a state agency seeking child support from someone who MIGHT work/have worked for us was reaching out. Legitimate email. Now, did they send this to HR? Some high profile person in the company? No. Somehow they managed to figure out three of our internal distribution lists (likely more, but only those three accept email from outside the domain) and sent a blast out to all of them.
 This is already in &quot;Oh hell no&quot; territory. But it was worse. There was an attachment as well as the person&#x27;s name. And the attachment, an OFFICIAL DOCUMENT, had the Name, Address, Family Members, and SSN of said person they were looking for. Sent to a distribution list with hundreds of recipients.
 HR notified, and well... I&#x27;d been putting off on learning how to mass delete things via Exchange powershell. Email is gone except for what&#x27;s been saved as evidence, but that information was still accessible for several hours. To hundreds of people.
 In HR&#x27;s hands now, and I really hope that state worker gets more than a slap on the wrist.
 Bless all of you who put tutorials online.

                              <span>We had basically no spam filtering when I inherited my new role managing a company and their email was just a firestorm of spam and garbage.
 I enrolled the domain in a new spam filtering service (Antespam) which I&#x27;ve used many times in the past and love it and it offers users the ability to whitelist/manage their own spam and have great customer support.
 Not 3 days in and I&#x27;m already getting all kinds of push back from people whining that they don&#x27;t want to have to babysit their email.
 I&#x27;ve tried telling them that checking the sidelined emails every day or at the beginning and end of each day here initially will give them the chance to add senders to their whitelist and as a result, legitimate emails getting sidelined will occur less frequently.
 &quot;Thanks, I hate it.&quot;
 I implemented the filtering on Friday night and it&#x27;s blocked 9 viruses, one spear phishing attempt and 91% of inbound mail was spam.
 The users heavily impacted by spam in the past are singing praises from the mountaintops (some would get anywhere from 50 to 100 spam mails per day) but those who got relatively no spam are up in arms that they didn&#x27;t need it, want to opt out (you can&#x27;t) and are seemingly trying to convince management that we don&#x27;t need this.
 The CEO is on my side, agrees that it&#x27;s best for our network safety and approved the move to the service. I am just trying to craft that diplomatic message to the nay sayers who maybe weren&#x27;t really affected by spam before but now are having legit emails get put on the sideline and causing them to have to routinely go and check for mail sitting in the filter.

                              <span>tldr; We’re the (now) three guys who built imUp -- the app that measures internet speeds and performance. Our first post in r/sysadmin received a ton of awesome feedback and suggestions two years ago on how to improve the platform and we’ve worked hard to build every feature that was requested. We’re back to give some insight into our journey since our last post and answer any questions or hear suggestions you may have. There&#x27;s a lot below, but we wrote this with the hope that the sysadmin community would find it interesting to hear the story of a small SaaS startup(?), how we approach enginering, and how we appreciate and act on feed back from the community -- you all.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to use winget to install software on some computers. I can get a normal powershell or cmd scrip to run, like creating a file under a certain filepath.
 But when I&#x27;m trying to use winget, nothing works. I use it in the system environment, at startup, with - -accept-package-agreements and - -accept-source-agreemets options.
 Obviously I&#x27;ve tried running the command by itself and it does work.
 I&#x27;ve tried to get the output of winget - -info to a file and it does not work either.
 Do you guts have any experience with that?

 I am standing in a blissful state of rest with all projects where they should be and no one making complaints.... Why do I feel anxious?

                              <span>Hi! 
 so i am new to this field and landed few months ago this &quot;helpdesk&quot; role but i am kinda a jack of all trades.
 I need to take on some security tasks, one of them is to split all the admin accounts to 2 accounts, 1 account to do admin stuff and 1 &quot;normal&quot; user account. (so for example, the IT personel now only uses 1 account for everything like normal desktop and mail work and also admin work). we want to split these into 2.
 I thought the best way to do this is to take a copy of the existing admin accounts and demote the existing admin account to an user account and the copy is the new admin account to do admin stuff. 
 Does any of you guys has experience with this? i am a bit stressed to operate this project. Any help is welcome.
 We are on a hybrid Microsoft environment.

The Microphone works in all other applications such as zoom, recorder, with external i/o devices and Teams through chrome. We have tried the all the common troubleshooting steps. We checked permissions, audio, disabled and re-enabled drivers, gpupdate, uninstall and reinstall application. used alternative input devices. Remove MS teams, deleted Teams %AppData% folder and restarted. One trick, we remove the .esc.data file – restart). I know of one trigger (quit MS Teams) allows us to use it briefly. This is on a Dell XPS Laptop. Any help would be great.

 Technical Aspect
 Essentially, what this application would do is to automate some repetitive task that are done on Unix servers.
 The reason why i am doing this in C# is because, the users doing these task are using Windows laptops. The users being my company&#x27;s customers. And they have been using tools such as putty/Moboxtreme to accomplish this task which is merely typing out unix commands on different machine 1 by 1.

                              <span>I upgraded a Windows 11 Home (Samsung Galaxy Book2) to Windows 11 Pro and have been having issues with it. For starters when I try to enable the wedget for the weather it tells me I need to log into my MS account, same goes for when I want to setup the Windows Hello.
 I have normal Windows 11 Pro machines at the office and I never have to log into MS to setup the wedget, as for the Windows Hello I haven&#x27;t experienced it yet as the owners don&#x27;t believe in laptops. LOL So this one is our first. 
 So I wonder if I should do a reinstall of Windows 11, but I am not sure how its going to work if I need to retype the KEY once its loaded to get back into Professional, at which point I might be just chasing my tail!? :(

                              <span>Working on replacing domain controllers and found something I never seen before. Maybe somebody over here can help me out on this.
 Let&#x27;s say my domain is domain.local and my domain controllers are DC-OLD and DC-NEW. I have promoted DC-NEW to be a Domain Controller and Demoted DC-OLD. When I look in my DNS I find:
 1) zone _msdcs.domain.local, this zone contains all records I expect, SRV records / _gc records / _ldap records etc.
 2) zone domain.local, this zone contains all servers / computers / etc.
 3) subzone, _msdcs under number 2. This is a DNS Delegate if I am right (grey icon). In this subzone I only find a NS record pointing to DC-OLD
 The NS record under 3 is not updated by the DC promotion and demotion (number 1 is updated correctly). Feels like it is not actively used in my situation, if I do a lookup to _msdcs.domain.local it will answer with information found in number 1. I think this is some sort of pointer solution used in ealier versions of Windows AD.
 What is the right thing to do? I can think of 2 scenario&#x27;s:
 a) Replace the NS record of DC-OLD with DC-NEW
 b) Do not give it any attention, let it just like this
 I think scenario a is the best option. Is this correct and does it have any impact on my AD / DNS if I take this action?

 I have a shared mailbox for example [HR@myorg.com](mailto:HR@org.com). When external senders receive a mail from [HR@myorg.com](mailto:HR@myorg.com) it can be confusing so i would like to change the display name so that they see the display name as something like &quot;CompanyName[HR@myorg.com](mailto:HR@myorg.com)&quot; without changing the actual email address.
 Is this possible?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a bit of a head scratcher, and I&#x27;m not sure how to get around it at the moment.
 I have configured an M2 based Macbook for a remote user, and part of that is installing the DUO client. Whilst setting it up, everything worked well and Duo sent a push notification to approve the login.
 Now the user has it, the laptop is obviously not configured for their home wifi, so Duo complains that it can&#x27;t do anything as it has no network connection. Putting the user in bypass mode makes no difference, as the client still can&#x27;t connect to the Duo servers...
 Apple in their infinite wisdom doesn&#x27;t allow you to connect to a wifi network from the login screen. Using the Option key to boot up and connect to a wifi network doesn&#x27;t pass the connection through to the login screen either.
 I have sent the user a USB-C to LAN adapter which said it was plug and play on Macs, and although it works on their personal Dell laptop, it doesn&#x27;t work on their company issued Mac. I don&#x27;t know if this is because it doesn&#x27;t work on M2 devices, or if the Mac needs to silently install something when it&#x27;s connected, but because the laptop isn&#x27;t logged in, it&#x27;s not able to.
 I&#x27;ve ordered another adapter for the user which claims compatibility with M2 Macs, so I&#x27;m crossing fingers for that.
 The user is 2 1/2 hours drive away, so a visit is not really practical.
 Does anyone have any ideas on how I can best get this user up and running?

 ​
 ​
 is there any way to tell remote machine is virtual machine or physical machine, I have 100 machines, i want to know which are virtual which are physical.
 ​
 Also , We don&#x27;t have any hostname for remote environment. Just We have VLAN Address informations.
 ​

 thanks,

                              <span>Problem: People are missing non-junk emails because they end up in the junk folder. Especially if they are auto-forwards from another domain.
 Ideally, we want nothing to go into the junk folder (unless on the block senders list). So everything goes to the inbox, notwithstanding malware and phishing. With everything going to Inbox, it would also be nice to get some indicator of junkiness as a MailTip on the message, but we&#x27;d settle for pre-pending the subject.
 Have a ticket open with Microsoft, and here&#x27;s what we tried:
  
Change the anti-spam policy. Any actions that say &#x27;send to junk folder&#x27; have been changed to prepend the subject with &#x27;Possible spam&#x27;.
  
This doesn&#x27;t really work. Yes, the subject is changed. But the email still ends up in the Junk folder. Maybe Outlook is doing this by examining the SCL. But there&#x27;s also no way to turn off the junk filter in Outlook. Just in case, I checked the blocked domains/emails list, and it is empty.
  
Set up a transport rule to change all inbound mail to SCL -1. 
  
This works, but I don&#x27;t like it because a) it doesn&#x27;t prepend the subject, and b) it alters the SCL artificially, so by the time you get the message, you don&#x27;t know what the original SCL was.
  
Adjust the rule to prepend a subject. Ended up pre-pending everything. So we adjusted the rule to only apply to inbound mail where the SCL was above 4. But then the rule seemed never to get applied.
  
Advice? (other than use a 3rd party product)

OneNote has been my main tool for note taking, but it&#x27;s getting too messy. I ALWAYS think &quot;ehhh.. I&#x27;ll remember this&quot; and then in 4-months when somebody asks me about X ticket it&#x27;s always a mission to get everything together again.
 Do you guys have a tool, more like a database which is good for note storing? Something where you can reference a ticket number or project name and link all the notes you took relating to it.

                              <span>Posting this here as a hail mary since I haven&#x27;t had much success elsewhere yet.
 Recently, our organization updated from ActivClient 7.1.x.x to 7.4.1.5 and started seeing some inconsistent results with our smart card functionality. Previously, we didn&#x27;t really have any issues, except some few instances we we began rolling out O365 (that requires PIV auth) over the summer. In our VDI infrastructure, we had more issues with O365 and were told to update our ActivClient by our parent org. We ran into a host of more issues, but now that we updated a small batch of physical workstations and see some similar behavior, it is helping us zero in on the ActivClient 7.4.1.5 version specifically.
 What we&#x27;re seeing: mostly smart card failing to read the certificate, but error messages vary. For my own…</span>

 Run a non-powershell command in PowerShell: pwsh -c &quot;id -u&quot;
  
This error occurs both when starting a screen session on my host, connect to my server via ssh and run pwsh -c &quot;id -u&quot; and when first connecting to my server, starting a screen session on my server and running pwsh -c &quot;id -u&quot;.
 My current workaround is to instead run pwsh -c &quot;{ commands }&quot; | cat.
 Running pwsh -c &quot;id -u&quot; in a screen session on my host (i.e. without ever connecting to my server via ssh) works.
 Does this sound familiar to you? I&#x27;m very confused - it doesn&#x27;t make any sense to me.

                              <span>Hey all, 
 We have an small on-prem AD with 10 servers and 35-40 clients. Users are warehouse users working at packing stations on kiosks and the servers are controlling warehouse stuff + microsoft infra servers. 
 Now the wsus have stopped working. 
 ​
 Thinking with only 35-40 clients (servers are managed by Azure Update Automation which is not supported for Windows 10), wouldn&#x27;t it be easier with updating against WU directly? 
 Bandwidth is not a problem. But we want maybe be able to do half of the workstations at the time if we get an bad update. 
 Whats your take? 
 Thanks

                              <span>I was configuring CA policies as a global admin and may have locked myself out. 
 I have hardware toke,password and authenticator for the account. I can sign in using one of the two(for admin)but it shows Verify your identity. My understanding is that additional verification is set to have 2 methods, verify using email and authenticator. 
 I was testing out authentication strength and enabled the highest one with hardware token or windows hello or business or Certificate for admins. I do have authenticator and if the prompt shows up(when I sign in to non admin stuff) it gets stuck on verify your identity because authentication strength for users was also enabled to passwordless. I do have that but I am not excluded from the policies. 
 I have already contacted Microsoft and they have arranged a call back but I was wondering if there is any solution. No glass break account available. If I click cancel, it shows account as signed in but. It goes to verify your identity when I click on it.

                              <span>Hey Folks,
 I think MI Support is playing me here.
 We are currently running Core 11.5 and we usually use a policy to restrict iOS devices not up to date to connect to our Infra.
 Our current config is set to quarantine anything before iOS 16.1. With the arrival of 16.2 we wanted to update said config to 16.2 but it is not listed there.
 ​
 Mobile iRon is not telling me to update Core because only EPMM 11.8 will support iOS 16.2.
 They are sending me a bunch of kbase about Compatibility and according to said kBase even Core 11.7 would be not compatible with anything above iOS 15.5.
 ​
 Am i the only one having such problem with Ivanti/Mobile iRon ? 
 ​
 ( We could upgrade, but given the poor support, i&#x27;m not sure this would fix it. 
 We are on freeze due to year end, so that would anyway require a thousand approvals from the business.
 yes i have done the Device and Platform update manually ).

 Never had such non-existent support with any vendor. 
 Do you have recommendations for a viable robust alternative?

                              <span>Might be a long shot with such a specific monitor/series of monitors but the issues we are experiencing are killing us and Dell are mostly denying there&#x27;s anything wrong with their hardware.
 We have a few thousand of these in use. On the latest firmware (*08). Power Saving turned off. Dell laptops. Dell keyboards and mice. Dell everything. Some of the issues our user&#x27;s get:
  
Loud screeching noise from the speakers begins randomly while user&#x27;s are in Teams meetings. Monitor has to be power cycled to shut it up.
 
Various devices inside the dock will randomly not be passed to Windows (eg: ethernet, 2nd display (daisy chained)). Sometimes both displays show nothing but peripherals like keyboard and mouse work. Unplugging the USB-C cable and plugging in 3 to 20 times seems to resolve it until next time.
 
Slow detection/starting up of monitor/dock once USB-C cable is connected. Users say they &quot;often&quot; see it take a minute for the screens to display anything.
 
Arcing / crackling sound when the monitor is in standby and no laptop is connected. Power cycling stops the noise temporarily.
 
Microphone quality / audio issues during Teams meetings. I&#x27;m aware of the &quot;double noise cancellation&quot; issue that occurs when Teams is trying to reduce background noise and the monitor&#x27;s microphone is trying to do the same, but come on, these are supposedly &quot;Teams certified&quot; devices. How is this conflict expected behaviour?

                              <span>Hello, we have a problem within the whole department. Earlier this month I made a post where we had office 2010, outlook and excel issues. Boss allocated few licenses for 2016 and we still have issues - certain files won&#x27;t open and network usage sharply increasing during opening that certain file, although, mail text is empty sometimes, some has crashed when setting up signatures.
 Switched from 2010x86 to 2016x64, clean install. Additionaly installed SAP and Oracle SmartView and updates. We were also trying to open a file without sap and sv, no change.
 That accounting department won&#x27;t pay us for that switch lol. The funny thing is that this issue is only on new laptops company bought. Both new laptop and old pc has same os, same updates and same software with add-Ins, but laptop won&#x27;t open docs that pc can.
 Reinstalling windows would be a nice idea tho. Still, this case has 33% chance after reinstalling windows.

 Trying to transfer a domain name from GoDaddy to Bluehost. Reason being marketing created a new self managed website on Bluehost. 
 If I transfer the domain to Bluehost. I know I&#x27;ll need to create the DNS entries first to match....... But should I be concerned about downtime or services breaking? 
 I&#x27;m not a DNS expert by any means. In fact I inherited the responsibility. But there&#x27;s a lot of looks like garbage in there probably from previous me&#x27;s and you&#x27;s that said maybe this will work. My concern here is I see a lot of ms365 stuff. We have a hybrid solution but I don&#x27;t know if transferring will break things.
 Any help will be appreciated. Let me know if you have any questions or if you would like me to put in a ticket l!!!!!!

                              <span>I recently moved to San Antonio to get closer to a family member. I had a fully remote job but decided it&#x27;s time to change jobs. I was able to land a decent paying job 20% salary increase with great learning opportunities. Since I am new to the city I didn&#x27;t bother to check traffic/commute when I accepted the job. It&#x27;s about 25 miles away but the traffic is so horrible my average daily commute is 1hr10min each way. That&#x27;s 40hr+ a month sitting in traffic. During holidays my commute is 25-30 min and any bit of rain makes it 1hr30min+. What&#x27;s even more sad is traffic doesn&#x27;t die down until 8-9pm. I HATE SAN ANTONIO. /rantover
 How bad is your commute?

                              <span>Hi Everyone -- I&#x27;m looking for an example Patch Management Standard to use as a model/template. Do you have one you can share? 
 Also, do you know if anyone has published a capability maturity model for Patch Management?
 Any suggestions/links, etc. would be appreciated!
 e.g
 - All Machines C disk status control
 - App Owner notification after patching
 so on

                              <span>I am having issues with a radius server behind a site to site VPN.
 I have a Synology NAS using the Radius Server setup. Local clients can use the WPA Enterprise locally.
 This is behind a Dream Machine Pro SE.
 I have a site to site VPN setup
 I have a UDM that is connected site to site to the UDM Pro SE.
 Clients on the UDM using the site to site VPN are not able to use the WPA Enterprise. When I did Wireshark it shows the source IP is the WAN address to the local address. Is there something that needs to be changed on the Unify devices because it is not showing anything on the Radius server as trying to auth.

                              <span>I recently had a disagreement with my CIO over compensation for an assistant net admin vs an assistant sysadmin. I told him they should be paid the same if they had the same experience, etc; he said that sysadmins are worth more. I was flabbergasted. As the senior netadmin, I’m compensated the same as the senior sysadmin. Is this a common thing in IT, across industries that sysadmins are worth more than netadmins, or am I right in demanding they be equal?

                              <span>At one of our branch sites, for the past few days, users have been complaining about network connectivity being lost or crawling while attempting to access certain websites. During the time they say the issues are happening, no maintenance, or backups are occurring. Something tells me to check the routes on the customer edge router at the site and I see that all of iBGP learned routes are recently learned. Flapping has crossed my mind so I check the logs, and around the same time users “lose”connectivity to the sites, one can see BFD adjacencies going down between the CE spoke and a WAN reflector we have in another location. 
 Interestingly enough, the websites users are attempting to access are not suppose to be learned via iBGP. They are externally redistributed in EIGRP. During the issue, when checking the time of the EIGRP routes, they are days old. So how could users not have access to the sites? When you run a trace to the website during the issue, it makes it there. When you check the ISP vrf, the route to the PE is still there. No circuit issues are seen. 
 Any ideas?

 The thing I need to figure out quick, and if anyone could point me in the right direction I would appreciative… how do I go about changing the initial greeting to a temporary holiday greeting? My management said it’s all pre-recorded and that all I have to do is “flip the switch” on Christmas eve morning… I have located those pre-recordings but I’m lost in the sauce on how to apply them. Literally any guidance, article, video, etc would be helpful. 
 I only have 2 days to figure it out... thanks everyone.

                              <span>Hello dear colleagues, 
 I have a question in regard to setting up some filters on Juniper EX switches and I hope you can help me out with a sanity check and ideas on how to make my configuration better. Or if I am on the wrong path - set me towards the correct one.
 For the sake of this question, let&#x27;s assume the following very simple topology:
 ​
 Juniper MX Edge ----&gt; Juniper QFX Core ---&gt; Juniper EX top-of-rack ---&gt; Host1, Host2, Host3, HostX
 ​
 Each VLAN is up on the QFX Core and the EX TOR switches act as simple Layer2 devices only. Ideally, we want to keep this configuration like that and not bring VLANs up on the EX switches - only ACLs.
 ​
 Currently, each of the hosts connected to the TOR switches (in our case - dedicated server services) are in their own VLAN with a /30 of IPv4…</span>

 I have an HCI cluster connected to two disparate switches. The NICs on the cluster are set to active-backup, so if the active fails for whatever reason it is supposed to switch to the backup.
 The two switches are directly connected via LAG/Trunk (LACP). The two switches are also connected to the core for user traffic.
 I&#x27;m trying to avoid potential issues with spanning-tree topology changes causing all of the ports to go into listening mode for 30 seconds, and crashing the whole cluster. I have implemented portfast/admin-edge on all ports connecting to the HCI, but I also want to enable it on the Trunk/LAG.
 I&#x27;ve been taught to never implement portfast on uplinks to other switches, so I&#x27;m afraid to pull the trigger on that last part. But I would think that the core uplink from the secondary would always be in a blocking state unless the primary core uplink goes down. Does that sound right? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello all,
 Recently I was connecting 2 floors together with the exact same Cisco 9300s, running near the same SW Ver (One is running 17.03.04 the other 17.03.05). While connecting these two with SFP+, I put in the EXACT same SFP+ modules, and I couldn&#x27;t get a connection, even though the switches saw them both. Both SFP+ were brand new. After much troubleshooting, I swapped one out with a different one, and viola, I got connection. Now here are the two SFP+ modules, and tell me how this is working, and why the exact two didn&#x27;t. (I&#x27;m new to working with fiber, so please bear with me) 
 Floor 3: SFP-10G-BX ; 1330nm ; LC Connection
 Floor 2: SFP-10G-BX80 ; 1270nm ; LC Connection 
 I thought the wavelengths HAD to be the same on both ends? What&#x27;s the deal? Also, this is a single wire, yellow cable, (SFP&#x27;s are single too) which I believe to be single mode. Any insight would be appreciated!

                              <span>Looking for a Netflow Analyzer solution. Currently using PRTG as a Netflow collector. It does the job, but leaves a lot to be desired and does not have the ability to overlay security analysis, threat reporting, and IP reputations, etc. I was really excited to try Elastiflow, but without a DevOps team and no knowledge of the ELK stack the learning curve us far too steep.
 Any recommendations for Elastiflow-like Netflow Analysis solutions?

                              <span>Cisco is proposing a Nexus 9k environment backed by Nexus Dashboard to upgrade our horribly EOL 6509s. We originally were going to 7706s and then they EOLd those as well. My original plan to use VDCs on the 7706s appears to be dead.
 I&#x27;m pretty unfamiliar with ACI/Dashboard, but they&#x27;re pushing this because I wanted to use VDCs, and they&#x27;re saying I can do the same thing but with &#x27;slices&#x27;. 
 Additionally I can see us using VXLANs as well.
 WTF am I getting myself into? Managing Nexus at the cli is no problem for me, but selling my soul to a dashboard (one from Cisco at that) is something I&#x27;m wary about.
 Should I bail?
 Thanks.

 I&#x27;m looking for the smallest footprint network monitoring and alerting software available. I need to install it in *NIX. All I need is icmp/TCP checks on around 20 remote devices, and then email alerts if those aren&#x27;t responding after a certain amount of time.
 I don&#x27;t need a web interface, or graphing, or historical data. I&#x27;d even prefer to avoid installing mysql or any DB if possible.
 Does anything like this exist? I&#x27;ve used LibreNMS/Zabbix/icinga2/etc in the past and they are fantastic, but they are overkill for the needs I have on my current project.
 Maybe my best option is to throw together a crude bash script?
 Thanks in advance for any ideas you can send my way!

                              <span>Hi Everyone - my company currently uses a &quot;Traditional&quot; client vpn solution and we are focusing on Prisma Access and Zscaler as a replacement. I like the idea of the service connections for Prisma, the connectors that run on a VM/container for Zscaler was unexpected, but I do like what they are capabale of doing.
 We are heavy on all workstation OSs - windows, macos and linux. 
 Also, the environment consists of public/private clouds.

 Any annoyances that have come up for you or clear improvements for your team and employees?

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m writing this post to get some advice regarding a problem that is affecting the network of the company I work for.
 Our infrastructure consists of L2 devices (switches, radios etc) within it and is &quot;delimited&quot; by many L3 routers which are the edges of our unic large broadcast domain. Obviously there are several VLANs within it, but we have to propagate them over the backbone links, preventing us from segmenting the network.
 The problem is the following: every time we put a new PC on the network, it starts a NetBIOS boradcast storm that propagates to all our switches, causing us many problems. We have intercepted the packet with WireShark and we are certain that this is the problem, what we don&#x27;t understand is why the packet continues to run even after disconnecting the offending PC. We have already taken steps to put in the broacast limits (storm constrain etc) but we would prefer to solve the problem at the source.
 Has anyone ever had a similar problem? Is there any way to prevent the storm, apart from disabling NetBIOS? Could this be due to a malware installed on one of our networked devices?
 Thanks to all those who will respond!

 We have them in several locations and I&#x27;ve recently taken the role as primary maintainer. What I&#x27;ve found is that they seem to be very buggy. They come with a process that will initiate a reboot when internet connectivity is lost but once in a while, they don&#x27;t fully recover from the reboot. power cycling to reboot again doesn&#x27;t work. 
 We also see an issue where the admin interface ssh daemon fails and you can&#x27;t log in that way. webui still works. 
 Their support is... lacking to say the least.
 Their firmware path is questionable. 
 Multiple power cycling doesn&#x27;t appear to help, only consoling in and rebooting that way allows it to properly shut down and restart.
 So it almost seems like our out of band management system needs an out of band management system.
 Anyone else have experience with Perle and maybe some hints?

 Hey folks - I was here not long ago with my nerves strung out in the wind, about moving from &#x27;Enthusiast&#x27; IT Knowledge into a Corporate setting that would put me out of my comfort zone.
 Good news to come since my last post is.. I was offered, and accepted the (~permanent unless otherwise stated~ contract) job! To be clear, what I mean is.. I work as a 10…</span>

I deleted the AD accounts to clean it up but didn&#x27;t realize our hybrid on-premise sync would delete their M365 account and email as well.
  
 I noticed what I&#x27;ve done 3 hours later and immediately restored their deleted accounts in the Exchange &quot;deleted users&quot; recycle bin. I noticed it forced me to create a new temporarily password, which I notified them of. Is there anything else I need to do to make sure their mailbox is restored back to normal with their old emails?

While my experiences with the company were mostly decent until now, my supervisor is requiring that I install Microsoft Intune MDM on the personally owned mobile phones of employees accessing company resources on their devices. Company resources include Outlook, OneDrive, SharePoint, and other websites accessible via Microsoft SSO, for example. This effectively mandates MDM for all salaried employees with no way to opt-out, as they are generally required to have company resources installed on their personally owned mobile phones.
 My supervisor’s goals are to ensure that personally owned mobile phones with access to company materials are encrypted and locked. He also wants to make su…</span>

 Do any of you have experience with setups like this, or have any recommendations?

                              <span>So I am looking into start of authority and am curious about something.
 We have 5 Domain Controllers, 2 of which are having replication issues. DC1 is one with replication issues and also so happens to be the SOA for all DNS zones on all of the DCs.
 DC2 is a direct mirror of DC1, with the exception of ADFS, and so I thought &quot;what if we made DC2 SOA for all the DNS zones across all DCs&quot;
 If this change were to be made, what potential issues would you expect I run into?
 The reason this thought exists is due to replication being down on 2 DCs, we want to demote and repromote without DNS giving us an error, especially since we already tried this and we found out that it was due to SOA.
 Any insight into this or helpful suggestions, would be appreciated.
 **additional info*\*
 there is a bit of background missing here, most of which I do not have since I have only been in this position for 5 months.
 From what I can put together from various conversations the prior sys admins made undocumented changes to the DCs, which ive been working to understand,. its slow going.
 The issue we have is 4 of the 5 DCs have the same DNS forward/reverse zones and the 5th is minus a few the other 4 have.
 The replication issue came on roughly 2 months ago and only hit DC1 and DC5 with an error that states &quot;sysvol inaccessible&quot;
 We tried to demote DC1 and repromote it, but when we did we got an error stating the DNS server was not present even though the role existed. 
 One of our contractors helped look into this and determined it could possibly be a start of authority issue.
 I have never had to actually do this before in all my time in IT, so this is very much uncharted waters for me. 
 ​
 Thank you

 Instead of outsourcing cheap labor we should outsource the most expensive parts of our companies. I truly think ChatGPT is up to the task.
 Edit: No I do not want my ChatGPT to play gold 3 times a week and sexual harass the executive assistants.

 I have a few servers with a conglomerate of control panels and want to test something else to see what&#x27;s out there.
 I stumbled on VestaCP, but that project seems dead, Hestia Control Panel seems to be the fork of that, and has code commits on github as recently as two days ago.
 Anyone here able to give me an unbiased elevator-pitch like opinion on it? I have a server with openisp but postfix on it keeps giving me the odd grey hair, and it is overly complex to maintain IMO.
 Feedback will be massively appreciated.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has any thoughts or experience here before I jump down this rabbit hole.
 I&#x27;m in a ~80 user environment that has on-prem AD (probably not going away) that&#x27;s using ADConnect to sync users to the cloud and O365/Exchange Online (for many years). Exchange has never been installed in this environment, so there are no Exchange attributes in AD.
 I have a few items I&#x27;d like to tackle (mostly cleaning up the GAL (hiding on prem DLs, hiding certain users), ability to add additional addresses to users) that seem they would be easier if I had the Exchange Attributes in AD. My understanding is I can just run 
 XX:\Setup.exe /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms /PrepareSchema 
 and that will give me the attributes I need, not install Exchange and I can do basic management from ADSI. I know I&#x27;ll need to refresh the schema in ADConnect, and I know that for &quot;msExchHideFromAddressLists&quot; to populate, &quot;mailNickname&quot; needs to be populated an unique.
 Here are a few questions I&#x27;ve come up with
  
Will this overwrite anything in the cloud and &#x27;break&#x27; existing mailboxes (stuff like legacyExchangeDN or X500 addresses)
 Should I continue with the installation of Exchange server for management purposes? If I go this route, do I need to set up Hybrid Mode? Or is &#x27;just installing&#x27; Exchange enough?
 Am I muddling my environment by adding Exchange? Should I instead take alternate routes to accomplish these goals? (like use msDS-CloudExtensionAttribute custom sync rules) For what it&#x27;s worth, if I installed Exchange, my plan would be to have it on a server that&#x27;s only booted when doing management tasks, but otherwise not powered on.
  
I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else has gone down this path before, and curious what you&#x27;ve seen... most of my worry is in overwriting something that was custom set on the cloud for a sync&#x27;d user, though I know most parameters must be sync&#x27;d from on-prem.

                              <span>Greetings,
 ​
 I am trying to write a batch file that goes through a text file and for each line of the text file runs psexec net user command.
 ​
 So far I have the following
 ​
 @echo off setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion :: Reset file Type Nul &gt;&quot;C:\outputfile.txt&quot; for /F &quot;delims&#x3D;&quot; %%a in (C:\ip_addresses) do ( set Var1&#x3D;\\%%a psexec.exe VAR1 net user COMMANDS_HERE &gt;NUL 2&gt;&amp;1 If !errorlevel! equ 0 ( echo %%a Account-Created echo %%a Account-Created&gt;&gt;&quot;C:\create-account.txt&quot; ) Else ( echo %%a Account-NOT-Created echo %%a Account-NOT-Created&gt;&gt;&quot;C:\create-account.txt&quot; ) ) pause 
 ​
 I am definitely getting the second part of the else statement because I can&#x27;t figure out a way to add the &quot;\\&quot; to the %%a placeholder so that psexec executes on the target machine.
 ​
 I know the command I am running with psexec works without an issue as I have tested individually.
 ​
 I have to use this process or manually go and touch about 50+ machines ;-)
 ​
 I appreciate any input.
 ​
 Edit:
 Fixed formatting so my code was in code block format.
 ​
 Edit2:
 Powershell remote administration is not an option...I know, I would much rather use the fantastic tools supplied with Powershell.

                              <span>I have been trying to troubleshoot an issue with a org user not receiving notification emails from our support system. In Mimecast the email bounces with an NDR 5.4.1 Recipient address rejected. At first I thought it was a problem with Mimecast but it seems this is the bounce you get when DBEB is rejecting the email. Now I didn&#x27;t know much about it too be honest until the last few weeks. Microsoft support is useless. They just constantly refer me too their support page explaining DBEB. This user is replicated correctly within O365 from what I see, and our accepted domains are all set to authoritative. Besides that, I am convinced this support system sending these emails (amazonses) has the user on the account level suppression list due to the bounces, but I don&#x27;t have access to this account to verify. Either way DBEB is the first barrier I need to make sure is not rejecting emails to valid addresses. Anyone have any ideas?

                              <span>After talking to an MS support rep, I now know I need a dedicated MS Defender for Office 365 license for every shared mailbox that benefits from the protection.
 However, I got mixed information regarding these shared mailboxes also needing an exchange license (I don&#x27;t need any of the exchange features coming with the license).
 So my question is:
 Do I need an exchange online license and MDO licenses for each shared mailbox? Or is a MDO license enough?
 In case I need an exchange license, what happens if I run it without one?

                              <span>Now that we&#x27;ve rebuilt from the Rackspace disaster I have one more thing to figure out. Our spam filtering on Edgewave/GoSecure. Problem is it doesn&#x27;t seem to work with M365. I&#x27;ve gone in one of our domains and changed the MX, then went into the verifiers and added one for M365 and authorized it with Microsoft but it won&#x27;t test and it won&#x27;t discover mailboxes. Tech support says to use the M365 verifier and RCPTTO for discovery but it doesn&#x27;t work. And the error I&#x27;m getting on every single page of the website is a generic &quot;an error occurred. If this continues contact the administrator&quot; not anything like &quot;failed to discover mailboxes&quot; or &quot;verification failed&quot;. It&#x27;s like a web page error.
 Support has been no help at all. They keep saying the same thing about using the verifier and RCPTTO and that there&#x27;s an issue with the testing. When I explain I&#x27;ve done that they ask another dumb question like &quot;are the mailboxes not being created?&quot; And then don&#x27;t respond again. I&#x27;ve had pretty good luck with them up until now but I&#x27;m seeing the Rackspace fiasco all over again.
 Anyone have this working?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 Just checking the logon events in the security event log journal on one of my DC and i&#x27;m wondering if this is the expected behaviour that i have this:
 A Kerberos service ticket was requested.
 Account Information:
 Account Name: my domain administrator account (administrator@mydomain.whatever) Account Domain: my domain Logon GUID: xxxxxxx 
 Service Information:
 Service Name: a workstation from the domain$ Service ID: domain\\workstation$ 
 ​
 Network Information:
 Client Address: ::1 Client Port: 0 
 ​
 Additional Information:
 Ticket Options: 0x810000 Ticket Encryption Type: 0x12 Failure Code: 0x0 Transited Services: - 
 This event is generated every time access is requested to a resource such as a computer or a Windows service. The service name indicates the resource to which access was requested.
 This event can be correlated with Windows logon events by comparing the Logon GUID fields in each event. The logon event occurs on the machine that was accessed, which is often a different machine than the domain controller which issued the service ticket.
 Ticket options, encryption types, and failure codes are defined in RFC 4120.
 ​
 ​
 Do you guys think it&#x27;s normal to see my administrator account requesting kerberos ticket?

                              <span>Some consequences when things go wrong:
  
TSB has been fined nearly £49m for an IT meltdown in 2018 that caused chaos and left its customers unable to access online accounts for several weeks.
  
 https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64036529
  
Full report:
  
This situation has all the hallmarks of business management strong-arming the IT organization into an unrealistic timeline. When business leaders push for overly-aggressive timelines, or regulators ask for multiple competing risk frameworks and excessive after-the-fact incident reporting, this all puts a strain on the delivery organization’s ability to untangle the complexity before ‘go live’.

                              <span>The company where I&#x27;m working decided to implement this software for the holy security.
 While I understand the purpose of this software in a &quot;classical company&quot; for regular users I tought it was a really bad decision for us since we are an MSP. 
 90% of our staff are technical, it goes from support team to system/network/addwhatyouwant engineer, developpers etc. We must use admin rights multiple times a day since we have a lot of VPN software requiring it or some specific software for managing old SAN that customers kept even if they&#x27;re 10 years old and so on...
 I tried to convince the director not to install this since it will annoy user and cause problems, I suggested to use dual account policy on the machine: a regular user without rights and another with admin rights (both linked to …</span>

We just got a new email spam firewall service and it’s taken a lot of constant attention to get back where our old service was. So I’m going through the message log and see an email to the Director of IT saying the main domain registration expired! 
 Call and Director of IT. Credit card applied. Swears didn’t get any other notifications - I can see 3 in the email firewall 🙄
 DNS NS record was only down a few hours and seems to be cached most places. 
 Technically I’m a consultant to a former employer (my choice). Just earned my fees for at least this month. 
 And figured out why I couldn’t sleep all night. Now to double check my backups. 
 How have your sysadmin spidey-senses saved the day?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 After 10 years, in march of next year our root vpn cert will expire. I was tasked with renewing the cert(s).
 We have a large volume of connected devices that sometimes can have a downtime of few weeks, so i need to think and implement a solution fast so it can propagate.
 The devices have various hardware and software configurations, from different time periods, so i want to make as minimal changes as possible (e.g. avoid redirecting to a different openvpn instance).
 My google-fu gave me one method - stacked certificates - also explained by hexonet on their blog: https://www.hexonet.net/blog/migrating-new-ca-for-openvpn , it seems that i could simply regenerate the client certs based on the new ca cert and swap them one by one without killing &quot;old&quot; access for not-yet patched cients.
 How would you approach it? There are milions of users so i would prefer to not introduce any significant downtime.

So i would like to install those devices without having to log in. Can i just log in using a local account, install everything and then add a microsoft account? It would auto login to office accounts right?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I have a VBS Script installed on my Thick client pc&#x27;s to get the information i might need. Now this works completely fine on local windows computers. But when i run it on a thin client or rdp session it (ofcourse) gives me the information of the server.
 Now what i would like to get is the connected server name, Local pc name, logged in user, windows build version of the client pc, and which groups/roles are added to the pc and logged in user.
 My current vbs script is visible here: https://pastebin.com/raw/iqnXY3VF
 I already searched on google but most of the things i could find are for local pc&#x27;s.
 thanks everyone in advance
 edit: I am aware that this might belong in the techsupport reddit but i think the changes to solve this are higher in the sysadmin community

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a problematic that I&#x27;m not sure how to solve easily :
 Previously, we had some Office 16 licences and we used them on some PCs from our fleet. But they weren&#x27;t many and we widely used LibreOffice instead. So when we wanted to install Office on a certain PC, we used a .exe and did a manual install.
 Today, we decided to switch to Office 2019 for all of our users, and with that comes a problem.
 I have to create a GPO which checks if Office 2016 is installed on a computer. If so, it should uninstall it and then install Office 2019 with our key.
 But I also have to make sure the PCs with Office 2007 are excluded from that GPO, since we still use that with some applications that require 2007 specifically.
 Do you think I can do that with only one Powershell script for example ?
 ​
 Thanks,

 I love when past me thinks of future me and it takes only 10 seconds to find that information over a year later!!!!

                              <span>Good morning,
 We&#x27;re running through Cyber Essentials, and one of the passing criteria is to block models that no longer receive security updates from the manufacturer (eg Pixel 3a with Android 10) from accessing cloud resources (authenticating via Azure AD).
 How are people managing similar scenarios, it seems a bit over kill to force users to enforce users to use Edge and enroll into Intune to manage this.
 My thoughts turn to Conditional Access Policy, where for iPhone I could block by iOS version, but that&#x27;s only shows a major version, ie iOS 16, not iOS 16.2. Android is even worse where it seems to just display Android
 Have others had to achieve the above and if so how are they tackling this? Is the only way by enrollment? I&#x27;m using a Microsoft 365 E5 license if that helps suggest options.
 ​
 Thanks in advance,

                              <span>Hi I&#x27;m facing an issue that is not easily Googleable and that the SPF RFC seems a bit vague on. Perhaps more experienced folks than I can shed some light?
 Let&#x27;s say I have an SPF record spf.foo.nl and I want to change it to a CNAME pointing to spf.bar.com, which has the exact same content as spf.foo.nl. Would email clients view this as an extra DNS lookup?
 The SPF RFC seems to say that it the limit only counts to the lookups generated inside the record by include and the like, but doesn&#x27;t mention what happens outside the SPF record (for instance in a CNAME record leading to it).
  
Since this is the internet, I know I have to prevent &quot;just do X instead&quot; or &quot;you shouldn&#x27;t do that&quot; by providing a use case:

 I have to provide a Virtual Windows 10 Machine for a supplier, from which they can Access certain Servers.
 The Provider has quite high priviledges, which is why i&#x27;d like to Monitor the Desktop, to see what he did when. The Provider accesses the machine via Teamviewer.
 What is the best / cheapest option, to monitor a single client / user. It&#x27;s only a temporary solution, in two months, i dont need the product / license anymore.

 Thanks for your inputs.

                              <span>What are some career options can I transition into that doesn’t require doing on-calls and late night maintenances?
 I’ve been working as a sysadmin (linux, networking) and then a dev ops engineer (cloud stuff, some python for building tools and automation) for close to 10 years now. Started doing entry level stuff and then “senior” now according to my job title.
 However, one thing that has stayed consistent is that I’m always expected to do on-calls.
 Over the years, on-call has taken its toll on me. I lose weekends that could have been spent on hobbies, or with friends. I have chronic insomnia due to all irregular work hours and late night calls. In short, I constantly feel tired, lonely and mildly depressed.
 Asides from that, I enjoy the job and tinkering with the tech. I don’t think I am ready to leave this industry and do something completely different (like woodworking or something).
 From where I am, what are the possible jobs that I can transition into that doesn’t require on-calls?

                              <span>Hello, 
 I was watching a video on switches that stated a switch can store MAC Addresses in it&#x27;s CAM table after there has been an attempt to communicate from A to B and then a reply from B to A. That would store the MAC addresses of both A and B, but if this is the first time either of these are communicating on the switch I assume it would have to broadcast the entire message from A to B to all ports (similar to a hub) and listen for where the reply comes to map B to it&#x27;s proper port. If that is true could that be a security risk? 
 My other thought is that it would just be one frame (since after first frame it would all be routed directly A to B) so it might not be a huge deal. All of this for the main question of is it possible to have the switch send essentially a &quot;discovery&quot; frame to every port and map the replies so that it wouldn&#x27;t have to send an initial message to all ports. 
 I also think I may be overthinking a relatively miniscule detail but it just caught my attention and was curious. I appreciate anyone taking the time to read and reply!

                              <span>Hi all, have a question about networking and didn&#x27;t know where to go to or what to google so I came here.
 For context, I&#x27;m not a network professional nor an IT expert. I work for a small architectural firm and I&#x27;ve been trying to push for an integrated workflow using open source software platform like NextCloud and OpenProject.
 We&#x27;ve purchased a cheap NAS as a test run to set up a server running docker containers with the abovementioned items. All the apps are routed with SSL through nginx &amp; letsencrypt certificates and I&#x27;ve checked that all internet traffic is forwarded to the server&#x27;s nginx&#x27;s reverse-proxy.
 So things are working, but the problem is that the entire office&#x27;s LAN &amp; Internet speed is capped at 100mbps.
 The LAN routing setup here is a bit messy and unfamiliar to me since …</span>

 I&#x27;ve got a Cisco 9300 that I am trying to load an OS onto and transfer files but whenever I try to open it i get
  %Error opening flash:/usbflash0 (No such file or directory). 
 I&#x27;ve tried 4 different brands of flash drives and formatted them with a partition size of 4GB and tried both FAT and FAT32. The switch recognizes a usb has been inserted as it shows it with a console message and appears in the file system.

                              <span>Hey all. I hope this is the right place to ask.
 I am developing what has turned into a small mmo. Every tick of the server sends an update packet for the actors to each connected client. There are other times a server will queue packets for other events to download partial compressed contents (zip) for the next area if the player does not have it. 
 The network code is very simple. We use UDP and have our own packet processor that handles queuing, waiting, sorting, chunking packets for various data-types types. 
 Lately more players are reporting a lag. The servers are taking longer to reply, some cannot start isolated P2P combat sessions when they could before, and so on. I have no expertise in this area except for the protocols I&#x27;ve read about and network architecture to for games. 
 Is it possible that ISP&#x27;s are throttling unrecognized packet types? Since our packet structure is in-house, and each one varies, my hunch is the ISP is scrutinizing and scanning this traffic because it looks suspicious. I wonder if we wrap our packets in a well-known protocol like WebRTC for instance, if we&#x27;d get faster response times. 
 The code itself isn&#x27;t the culprit because the players reporting the issues are using the latest client which has not changed in a year now. If it&#x27;s possible the packets are being throttled, my next step will address that. But if it&#x27;s not likely, then I will need to consider other factor causing online stability issues.

                              <span>I have a question regarding single homed devices on a n9k vPC setup.
 Take for example a security server connected on the vPC primary n9k-1 on eth1/1. It has a single nic
 that terminates on a security VLAN on just that one switch. 
 If I leave all VLAN&#x27;s trunked across the peer link then eth1/1 gets flagged as an orphan port. If I prune the security VLAN from the peer link then that flag is removed. 
 My question is...is there any downside to just leaving the VLAN on the peer link and having an orphan port? If the peer link goes down nothing would happen to an orphan port or non-orphan port by default and we want this port to stay up if the peer-link fails. If the entire switch fails then we would have to physically move the uplink to eth1/1 on the secondary so that traffic would leave out that path.
 Correct me if I am wrong, but I feel like the orphan port concept is more geared toward active/passive devices where you want to explicitly shut a port on a switch that has shut its vPC ports to prevent black holing of traffic.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 My company has asked me to &quot;Load balance the SSLVPN&quot;.
 Basically, we have two locations, Main and our Disaster Recovery location. Both of these locations run SonicWall setups with HA and Dual WAN failover. Both have SSLVPN enabled. We use Local + LDAP Auth &amp; TOTP currently. We use Azure AD Connect to sync on prem AD to Azure. 
 The idea is this -
 If our Main site&#x27;s SonicWall were to go down, the boss would like for users to be able to seamlessly connect to the disaster recovery site without needing to change binding/URLs.
 How it works now -
 If the Main SonicWall were to go down, users can type in the URL to the secondary (DR Site) SonicWall&#x27;s VPN Office Portal. From here they can bind their TOTP, then log into NetExtender, change the &quot;server&quot; on Net Extender to the DR site&#x27;s URL, and log in with their credentials using the DR sites 2FA token.
 How they want it to work - 
 Main SonicWall goes down, users go to the same URL and can use the same 2FA token to login. Users would not have to change the &quot;Server&quot; on Net Extender. 
 I&#x27;m planning on setting up Radius regardless, and I&#x27;m looking into alternatives like Azure AD 2FA with NPS, though I&#x27;m having a hard time finding articles/research to help me achieve what I need to accomplish here. Anyone able to offer suggestions/ link articles that could nudge me in the right direction? My experiencing with load balancing is not the best I&#x27;ll admit.

                              <span>Hey all, I work for a medium sized manufacturing organization with ~20 sites around the US once we wrap up a few acquisitions. We are looking to do an entire network refresh of our switches and access points in all of our plants, offices, and data center. Right now we have a hodge podge of manufacturers from all of our past acquisitions and we are finally moving forward with standardizing our network. We have met with a few vendors and done demos are looking to make our final decision on who to proceed with. 
 We&#x27;re currently contemplating Cisco, Meraki, Fortinet, and Aruba. I&#x27;m attempting to make a list of items to evaluate and grade for each possible option and would love some of your feedback and ideas on what are some of your key features and criteria you&#x27;d look at when evaluating a new platform. Whoever we go with we will also purchase their NAC and that is a large consideration as well. Fortunately price isn&#x27;t much of a deciding factor as we have excellent backing from upper leadership to move forward with this.
 Thank you all very much for any advice and input you have.
 tl;dr: What criteria should I consider when evaluating switch and AP vendors?

                              <span>The choice is mine ultimately but I want to see what the fine people on Reddit thought and whether anyone has made a similar choice.
 I spent a long time getting good networking roles based on experience and demonstrable knowledge but now I really want to get some certs under my belt.
 Recently passed the JNCIS-ENT and loved that, was a good challenge (especially for someone so unused to exams).
 But now I&#x27;m thinking, well what next? My company I work for deploys a reasonable mix of Cisco and Juniper (mainly Cisco) - so I&#x27;m trying to decide whether to go for JNCIP straight away, get a few extra JNCIA certs (Sec/Dev) OR.... start on Cisco and get the CCNA. Or something else entirely!
 I should mention that it&#x27;s not just a vanity project and that ultimately I&#x27;d want this to positively impact my career in the mid term.

Long story short, I&#x27;m trying to see what&#x27;s out there that could be integrated to a indoor location system that my employer has developed. A lot of potential customers love the idea that we can integrate with their two-way radio system and are okay potentially having to purchase new radio fleets to do that but aren&#x27;t excited when we mention the gateways we offer need to be installed with roughly the same frequency as their existing wireless solution to accurately track the beaconing devices. 
 Just trying to see what is out there to be potentially beneficial to prospective customers by keeping them from having to have a bunch of fixed infrastructure installed. Thanks

                              <span>hey, how are you guys? i need advice for a network automation and cmdb architecture. we have a network which is until now manually managed without any kind of automation (&gt;5k users, multiple sites, just ipv4). we use: 
  
hpe imc for switch management (VLANs, ports, configs)
 infoblox for dns/dhcp and ipam
 currently device42 as cmdb but are switching to i-doit
  
devices: 
  
firewalls are checkpoint devices
 switches and routers are mostly hpe cw7
 aps are aruba
 fortigates for site to site vpns
  
ticketing system: jiranow i have to provide accurate data for our new cmdb (we switch from dev42 to i-doit) and to create a network automation solution. 
  
how could a network automation architecture look like for networks like this in general? where should i start and how could a project plan look like?
 whats a simple nsot? should we use nautobot or use concepts like using git a data source (but how would you provide an API then)?
 how would you manage comware devices - open source solutions unfortunately lack support for comware compared to cisco/arista/juniper etc.
 whats your advice providing data from our devices and systems to i-doit? should we establish a nsot, aggregate data there and provide a single api to the cmdb? or a proxy script like netpalm? connecting the cmdb directly to the devices/systems? connecting the cmdb to hpe imc?
  
i would be thankful for any kind of advice!

                              <span>Hoping for some advice on how to potentially isolate / pinpoint an issue on one of our internet circuits.
 The circuit is giving off odd performance issues. A typical speedtest via Oookla I&#x27;ll not be able to get more than aoud 600Mbps down, upload I can peg out to 950 / 980Mbps. This is with a laptop directly connected to the providers NTE. Other speedtest sites can be terrible. UKFast / librespeed for example I&#x27;ll struggle to get 100Mbps in fact any speedtest site other than Ookla gives terrible results.
 I&#x27;ve logged a support ticket with the provider and we did some iPerf tests during a change window. iperf tests from an endpoint on their network saw roughly a Gb up/down. so their response was that the circuit is fine.
 For me that only proved the bandwidth between those two points on their network can transmit 1Gbps and that there&#x27;s an issue elsewhere. I&#x27;ve been advised by the provider that this is an &#x27;internet issue&#x27; and there&#x27;s nothing they can do.
 We have multiple 1Gbps internet circuits from the same provider, and an identical test from an alternate circuit shows me getting the full 1Gbps up/down, that to me proves it&#x27;s something on their network.
 What other tests can I perform to help build my case with the supplier? 
 Appreciate any advice

                              <span>Hi,
 I will preface this by saying that i&#x27;m new to networking and dont have so many years under my belt (1 year alltogheter, 6 months technical support B2B, 6 months technical support B2C).
 I&#x27;m currently working with a customer who has issues with bandwitdh, it is a 1gig link. The customer has two routers from us that are configured with redundancy (VRRP). Recently we tried to configure another gateway on their equipment and we suddenly see a increase in bandwitdh.
 When the VRRP group address is configured on the interface to the customer they only manage to measure 50 down and 50 up, while if we change the IP to one of the available IP&#x27;s in the range, for example the next IP, the customer suddenly measures 900/900..
 The issue only seems to persist on one of the VLANS that is configured, with a /29 net
 As long as they configure one of the other IP&#x27;s in the range as their default gateway they have no problems, but if they use the VRRP IP the problem appear.
 My understanding is that for the failover to function properly the customer has to use the VRRP IP as their default gateway, or else the clients dont know where to send their packets if R1 fails.
 I would greatly appreciate any tips for this problems.
 Keep in mind that I am new to this so my explanation may be lacking.

                              <span>Hello Fellow ASR 920 Users,
 I had noticed that all my 920s take a long time to boot! We just keep the .bin in the bootflash directory for it to load upon boot. 
 It takes roughly 20 minutes for them to boot into the IOS XE CLI and start passing data. 
 I am just curious if that is normal, or if someone else has run into this, and found some adjustments that minimize the boot time.
 Thanks!!!

                              <span>Now that this studio has a on-staff IT admin (me), I&#x27;m looking into upgrading their systems. Mainly the build machines. Currently, they use Jenkins on like 9 different desktop computers. Obviously I want to simplify this and get a server and virtualize this and use containers. Everything else we have is in the cloud (SCM, E-mails, File storage). Or should we just do hosted services online? Does making a build use GPU?

                              <span>Hi All,
 Long story short
  
There is an MBAM server (reporting doesn&#x27;t work tho)
 There is a GPO with Bitlocker settings
 Wanted to move Bitlocker to SCCM 
 Log said on clients that policy did not apply, as the workload for Endpoint Protection was switched ot Pilot Intune (crap)
 Looked at MDM... literally nothing set - just enable bitlocker drive encription
 
  
At this stage keys still get to AD, but it seems that most of the GPO settings won&#x27;t really apply (e.g. 256 bit cipher is set there, but checking on the client with manage-bde the cipher is 128 bit.
 I think literally the MDM setting takes over and it soley turns on bitlocker, but doesn&#x27;t really configure it to our needs.
 I&#x27;d happily move the slider over back to ConfigMgr, but Endpoint Protection has a lot of other stuff, defender firewall and what not...
 The pilot collection is however a huge one. With 95%+ of our clients... bummer.
 I am crying... any ideas?

                              <span>From Ars
  
Researchers recently discovered a Windows code-execution vulnerability that has the potential to rival EternalBlue, the name of a different Windows security flaw used to detonate WannaCry, the ransomware that shut down computer networks across the world in 2017.
 Like EternalBlue, CVE-2022-37958, as the latest vulnerability is tracked, allows attackers to execute malicious code with no authentication required. Also, like EternalBlue, it’s wormable, meaning that a single exploit can trigger a chain reaction of self-replicating follow-on exploits on other vulnerable systems. The wormability of EternalBlue allowed WannaCry and several other attacks to spread across the world in a matter of minutes with no user interaction required.
 But unlike EternalBlue, which could be exploited when using only the SMB, or server message block, a protocol for file and printer sharing and similar network activities, this latest vulnerability is present in a much broader range of network protocols, giving attackers more flexibility than they had when exploiting the older vulnerability.
  
Good news:
  
One potentially mitigating factor is that a patch for CVE-2022-37958 has been available for three months. EternalBlue, by contrast, was initially exploited by the NSA as a zero-day.

 Hundreds of iOS Exchange ActiveSync entries. I did the steps to allow iOS 15.6 to auto-update months ago. I assume these are old devices that can&#x27;t get to 15.6, but at least two are IT users who are on updated devices.

 Successful sign-ins for users whom I blocked the specific protocol in the Admin center last week. How can they still be signing in with a blocked protocol?

 We have a user who has set up two Out of Office replies - an internal and external. The problem is, external users are being sent the internal automatic replies. Any ideas?
 Have replicated the issue from a Gmail account - i.e. one that she doesn&#x27;t have saved in contacts or anything like that.
 Any advice gratefully received.

                              <span>Hey all,
 Context:
 I hack companies legally through called bug bounties. A few months ago, a Fortune 500 company gave me the opportunity to run phishing campaigns on their employees at a bug bounty event. 
 For some reason, they believed they were &quot;unphishable&quot; and offered a bounty for each employee I was able to phish. They were using Okta &amp; Duo for MFA. 
 So, I bought a domain similar to theirs. I used Gophish &amp; Mailgun to send an email, and Evilnginx to bypass MFA. I abused an XSS in one of their subdomains to redirect to a phishing page. Got 50+ pairs of credentials &amp; Okta sessions, and full access to their AWS console within 2 minutes. I was blown away and terrified by how simple it was to compromise them. 
 Questions:
 I&#x27;m looking at how people are defending against phishing.
 From what I hear, Proofpoint and Mimecast don&#x27;t stop most phishing emails. Security education can only be done so often and techniques are evolving.
 Vendor email compromise makes it even more difficult to prevent. 
 I know many people also run phishing simulations, but a recent study found &quot;that embedded training during simulated phishing exercises, as commonly deployed in the industry today, does not make employees more resilient to phishing, but instead, it can have unexpected side effects that can make employees even more susceptible to phishing&quot;
 You obviously can&#x27;t expect everyone to be a tech expert and you can&#x27;t expect email gateways to catch all phishing emails. If phishing simulations can have unexpected side effects, then what? Is trying to prevent phishing a hopeless pursuit?
 So, I&#x27;m curious:
  
How are you currently tackling phishing (including vendor email compromise)? 
 What providers do you use? (abnormalsecurity.com, inky.com, breachless.ai)?
 
 How often are you requiring security awareness training? With who &amp; why them?
 How do you detect compromise? What do you do next?
  
Thanks

They even screenshotted ChatGPT and didn’t even put any effort into hiding this. The answer was totally wrong. Shocked a £100’sbn quarter business would do this.

                              <span>just looking back at this year I&#x27;m realising how much I have developed some level of phone call anxiety due to dealing with some users in IT support
 This is the year that I have blocked numerous people on phone call, WhatsApp and skype more than i have ever done in my life due to users trying to evade the helpdesk, or call me at odd hours or when I&#x27;m off work...
 For example, we all took a break from work 3 days ago for the Christmas holidays and we are resuming work in the 1st week of January but today alone I&#x27;ve received 6 phone calls and 2 messages from some users which I have obviously ignored, yesterday it was 2 phone calls and 1 email -the level of disrespect for my personal time off is huge huge huge
 it has gotten so bad that i no longer answer 90% of phone calls from numbers that i don&#x27;t have saved in my contacts. If i receive a phone call from an unsaved number i ignore it and do a quick look-up to see if its some person from work, if it&#x27;s not i answer i.e if they call back again or i will call the person
 next year im just gonna be ruthless and more strict with this thing. When i joined the org 3 years ago i thought some of the seniors are just grumpy fellows who dont like to instantly and joyfully help some users (not that they are always like that) but there would be instances where i thought a user was given a cold shoulder -but now i seem to start getting it

                              <span>It is a problem that users are named in a short-sighted and somewhat archaic method. I&#x27;ve yet to come across a satisfying way of dealing with the inevitable issue of multiple people with the same name. Like a lot of places we currently base our user accounts on the given name, however I&#x27;ve found in the past that numbering subsequent similar accounts creates confusion with emails etc, and can also create a feeling of hierarchy.
 What would be your ideal system of naming user accounts? Do you have please methods of dealing with this issue?
 Given that we&#x27;ve already issued many accounts which are basically just the person&#x27;s name, do you have an original way of handling &quot;john.smith2&quot;?

                              <span>Hey there,
 I&#x27;m not sure how to correctly ask this question, but here goes:
 I recently set up an Ubuntu server and shared a drive with Samba to my Macbook. I confirmed that it is working, however, I decided to change the user owner of the shared folder, now I&#x27;m unable to &#x27;forget&#x27; the current network and re-add the drive with a different log in.
 I try to remove the credentials from the keychain and then do the Go &gt; Connect to Server routine to get the share again, but when I try to import it, it doesn&#x27;t ask for user or pass, it just automatically logs in as the previous credentials and they pop up again in the keychain.
 I hope this makes sense, could I please get some assistance with this?

                              <span>Hey guys,
 A few months ago I learned about autounattend, and made me an installation USB stick to use at the computer shop I work at. Recently my Home version of it broke, I made a new one, and put in the autounattend file from a backup. Now when we use it, it installs Windows Pro, so I doublechecked, and compared it to my Pro stick, and the generic key in the file is in fact for Home.
 Is there something else that could cause this?

Anyone have any recommendations for a safe password manager? It can run on either Windows or on my iPhone.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve stepped into a new role and have found a bit of a mess left behind by a previous administrator. 
 There is a group policy in place for our O365 that prevents older word files (I.E Word 95) from being opened. From what I understand, this Group Policy was implemented aprox 3 years ago. This is a very sensible Group Policy and I don&#x27;t want to change it. 
 However, I&#x27;ve also discovered that there appears to be a raft of Word 95 documents still within the business. IT never converted the pre-existing Word 95 documents on our 8-or-so file servers. 
 It appears the plan to deal with this was to be 100% reactive. If a user cannot open a document, they raise a ticket and the HelpDesk would manually convert the file. I believe the idea was that the Word 95 files used within the business would eventually get converted this way and this will become a non-problem. But 3-years on, this still seems to drive calls to the HelpDesk.
 I&#x27;d rather pro-actively convert all our existing Word 95 files and call it a day. My problem is it&#x27;s probably been a decade since I&#x27;ve needed to do a mass conversion of Word documents like this. And so far my Google-Fu has been failing me.
 Does anyone here have recent experience with a utility that&#x27;ll scan a file server and convert old Word documents en-mass?

                              <span>Good day all, in our organization that i do tech support we have a licensed/preactivated windows 10 ISO that we use for clean installations on user PCs, the ISO is now a couple of years old (2015) such that after each clean installation we have to give the PCs a lot of hours to upgrade the windows 10 versions several times to get to the most recent Windows 10 versions, and who knows after how many days or weeks will the Win 11 upgrade option appear -some production apps don&#x27;t even run on the dated windows versions
 ​
 How can i &quot;upgrade&quot; this Windows 10 ISO to Windows 11 so that each time i run it it installs Windows 11 -roughly 80% of our users were upgraded to Windows 11 on the new laptops acquired and should there be an issue that requires a windows reinstallation it would be a pain and great time consumer to start with that outdated ISO
 ​
 EDIT: I don&#x27;t know the key for the Windows 10 ISO that we use, when I joined the organization I was handed the ISO file as part of work &#x27;tools&#x27;. i don&#x27;t deal with a key during or after installation

                              <span>hi /r/sysadmin
 documentation atm is a disaster, being spread across multiple OneNotes. I finally convinced management to invest in a good documentationplatform, and now I have to choose one.
 My first thought was confluence, but reading up on it I am starting to have second thoughts: slow, cluncky, atlassian, steep learning curve and what not,... I read some good things about Nuclino, but I was wondering what this sub have to say (about this or other platforms).
 I know confluence works together with Jira. We do some in-house development so Jira could be useful to us. But it&#x27;s not like we are a codingshop that has multiple external clients that are in need of storyboards and such.
 requirements:
  
saas (yup, not even selfhosted on azure)
 kanban
 documentation
 some projectmanagement..
  
thx for the help!

                              <span>Hi all!
 Pretty new to this and I&#x27;m searching for an easy way to backup up to 10TB of data for a mid sized company. Let&#x27;s say I have this data on a server in some RAID. Is it still a viable way to do a full backup once a week to a seperate drive and store it off-site? Wouldn&#x27;t this take forever? As of today the company uses SharePoint which is quite problematic because it works dynamically and messes with the data sometimes. I want to do a backup once a week and not everytime something is changed. This backup is just for the case the office burns down so the RAID is destroyed in its entirety.
 Thanks!

 I think these are my last ciscos.

                              <span>Hello,
 I have a lot (~100k in last 24hrs) of events 4771, 4625 and 4776 mixed together, for only one machine account. The reasons is always &quot;User logon with misspelled or bad password&quot; or &quot;This is either due to a bad username or authentication information&quot;.
 It is Windows 7 Pro, fully updated (with no possibility to upgrade to Win10 due to lack of compatibility of installed software).
 All our domain controllers have installed Oct 2022 cumulative udpate.
 Computer is available in domain, I haven&#x27;t noticed any issues using it , everyone can log on it, GPO are working. First thought - it&#x27;s Win7, maybe old kerberos encryption used, so I&#x27;ve checked if computer is using DES / RC4 encryption - seems like it&#x27;s not.
 I cannot confirm if this issue existed before November patch, I&#x27;ve seen it few days ago. Shoud I be concerned? Any ideas?

 I can see both methods work but unsure on best practise here?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I currently have an exchange 2016 / 2019 environment. Everything is currently on the a pair of 2016 servers and all mailboxes on a DAG hosted by them.
 I&#x27;ve created two new 2019 servers and have a new DAG for them.
 My question is - can i start migrating mailboxes over to the new DAG whilst keeping some on the old DAG, and also keeping client access connecting to the old 2016 servers?
 Thanks

 The equipment was strewn all over the desk. My coworker responded &quot;I&#x27;ve already done it&quot;.
 He sure comes across as competent all the time.

 I tried increasing the LINESIZEas well as HTLML_MARKUP I tried every flag and the output is the same.
 another thing is that when there is a 7.887 it becomes 7.89 I don&#x27;t want this I want the exact data.I need to surround the values with double quotations this all I KNOW. 
 Any Ideas?

 ​
 I&#x27;ve been using Greenshot the screen capture program for years because unlike other programs I tried it was really simple and intuitive to use.
 ​
 For a couple months ago it&#x27;s causing a problem of capturing my screen of the past; to be precise when I play borderless games and do a screen-capture, it captures the screen of my game when I last alt-tapped instead of my current screen.
 ​
 Is there a fix to this? Also are there any easy screen capture program not just trailered for streamers but for casual usage? It would be nice if it&#x27;s simple to use for a layman and can capture videos too.

                              <span>I work for a small fintect business (around 100 employees) as a data engineer. The majority of the company&#x27;s key data is stored on a 1 TB prod Azure sql database (with matching dev and QA, and another smalled 300 GB SQL Server on-prem DB. A few analysts do power BI reporting off these data sources, and one of them connects to a pricing app our sales team uses. We are a microsoft shop basically.
 We are trying to implement true data management program, knowing that we have these needs but also wanting to cover some that we aren&#x27;t even aware we need. We do know we want:
 - Data dictionary/catalog so analysts know what are the main tables that have the data they want power BI reports and our own compliance
 - Some way to assign data stewards who can keep the data catalog up to date
 - Ways to tag data as PHI, or what it&#x27;s retention time is, to encourage privacy and retention compliance
 - Seeing lineage of our pipelines
 - Features that help consolidate records and the &#x27;golden record&#x27; pursuit
 - In general anything helping us get to the goal of practicing data management.
 The obvious answer is Microsoft Purview, and it seems to click a lot of boxes and we are a microsoft shop, but I&#x27;m worried about the pricing. It seems like it could get expensive really quickly with the pay for use model, beyond any value it brings. We have a reasonable budget for data management but it&#x27;s going to be hard to justify huge bills for what to most people will just be a data catalog.
 Other&#x27;s I&#x27;ve looked at are data.world, altan, collibri, and alation. Then I see these open source versions with apache atlas or linkedin datahub and wonder if I should be going the free route and spin something entirely myself? I&#x27;m not trying to turn this into a sales post because I am skeptical of all of them despite knowing we need something :)
 Has anyone solved similar data management wants with any of these tools? Or have any general advice.

 I&#x27;ve been working as system administrator and I always get a couple of these type of users, but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s fairly normal, or if they&#x27;re genuinely trying to be friends, which in the corporate world it&#x27;s kind of tough to tell as some are really good at this game.
 I just want to know if this is common place or if maybe I&#x27;m just too distrustful and this is something genuine.

                              <span>Hey guys. Got a strange one that I am struggling with. We have a setup where has a pretty recent workstation with an AMD Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM and an AMD Radeon Pro W5500 on Windows 11. The GPU as far as I can tell is the issue here, which is basically a cut down AMD RX 5700. When using the system normally, everything is fine, but when using it as an RDP host, connecting to it via a system with a Quadro K620 and a 4K monitor, it becomes a laggy mess.
 ​
 In group policy I have enabled the following:
 ​
 1 - Prioritize H.264/AVC 444 graphics mode for Remote Desktop Connections
 2 - Configure H.264/AVC hardware encoding for Remote Desktop Connections
 3 - Use Hardware Graphics adapters for all remote desktop services sessions
 ​
 I have this setup on another workstation that is currently using an old GTX 1080, and performance is excellent (I get random artifacting every once in a while, but overall it&#x27;s usable). For testing purposes I installed this card into the test system, and performance improved considerably. When checking stats on hardware utilisation, the Nvidia card shows GPU encode activity, whilst the W5500 (and my RX 5700 from my home PC that I brought in for testing) never show any GPU encode activity.
 What is interesting is that the GPU has no problem encoding when using something like OBS.
 ​
 Any ideas what I can do here to improve RDP performance on a 4K monitor using an AMD GPU? Latest AMD drivers are currently installed. I would rather not have to replace the GPU if I could avoid it, it should have the ability to encode properly. Suggestions appreciated.

                              <span>Hello all. Gonna preface this by saying I have almost no idea about anything web development or sysadmin stuff, so please bear with me. 
 I do quant related stuff and needed to build a basic web app for work. I made a short Python script, and used Streamlit to host it locally. It takes data from yahoo finance and does stuff with it. Nothing complicated. 
 It was working fine a week ago, but now when I run it, I get the following error (not verbatim but close):
 Cannot verify identity: self signed certificate in certificate chain
 The app loads (in Chrome) but throws this error along with others and doesn’t grab the data. 
 I’ve been trying to figure out the solution for probably 4 hours now and haven’t made any progress. I can’t continue the project until I solve this. It also doesn’t let me install packages. 
 If someone could hold my hand and walk me through this I would be immensely grateful. This shit is literally rocket science to me.
 I already asked in stackoverflow but nobody answered

We have been running into an issue when afk users get disconnected and RDP tries to reconnect, causing users to be banned due to too many non answered MFA notifications. Is there any way to unban these users or change the MFA failure threshold? I have scoured AAD for these setting and have only found the ban list for MFA utilizing the revolving code.

                              <span>Gotta say, pretty impressive. Not perfect, but way better than starting with a blank text file. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s coming for my job in the next year or two, but it&#x27;s certainly a helpful tool right now.
 I asked it for a RESTful API to accept an incoming webhook, check the data for inclusion of a string, extract a network address from the data, and make another external API call to update a list.
 It gave me probably 80% of the structure right off the bat. Decided to do a flask server with python3, in development mode. I asked it to please have that run in production mode. Boom, updated script and instructions for installing gunicorn along with the recommendation of running a reverse proxy in front of it. Asked it for http basic auth, boom first try. Not difficult things to do, but certainly easier to just ask and verify the answer.
 It definitely isn&#x27;t perfect and will confidently give you some BS. But it&#x27;s remarkable how often just calling out the BS will make it reconsider, apologize, and then fix it.
 I&#x27;d say it took a 2 day project down to about 5 hours. 40-50% of the code was written by me in the end, but that&#x27;s damn a damn good improvement for one tool.
 Apparently there are already vscode plugins for it.

                              <span>Me, I&#x27;m starting to hate it. I liked being that guy for quite awhile...the one where you went to if you needed something done in a hurry, or a problem solved that was otherwise unsolvable. But lately I&#x27;m finding that I&#x27;m getting more tired than inspired by the requests and more and more ground down as I handle everyone else&#x27;s problems....but have no one to offload any of my own to. And I don&#x27;t mind it (most days) from the user base - that&#x27;s the job, after all - but from within my own department, from my own peers. I mean, I don&#x27;t mind helping folks out but maybe, return the favor once in awhile? Maybe?
 How about the rest of y&#x27;all? Do you have someone who handles all the weird-ass crap that comes in or are you them? How many still find the challenges fun and how many now hide in a darkened datacentre like Gollum and his precious? What do you do when the weight of the escalations become too much? How much support do you get?

                              <span>So, we currently just use freshdesk for ticketing. It works! I want to step things up though and add some asset management, change management, documentation, etc. two man IT team with ~150 users/devices and I’m tired of documenting everything in excel. 
 Is it cheaper for us to just keep using freshdesk and find a solution that can do the asset, change management or think it’s best to dump freshdesk for an all in one solution?
 So far I’ve demoed fresh service and solarwinds. 
 I kind of like freshservice better between those two, but that’s only because we already live in the freshworks platform with freshdesk. 
 What you think? What y’all using? Please don’t recommend servicenow, lol. We just a two man IT team.

                              <span>I could&#x27;ve posted this in AITA (and even might still &#x27;coz it&#x27;s good content) but let&#x27;s face it, no subreddit will understand this scenario better than this one. 
 School holidays are upon us and this means people are bringing kids (and ipads, and phones, and Nintendo Switches...) to work and demanding the WiFi so the kids have something to do all day. 
 Fair enough, I get it. We connect them to the guest WiFi, which is segmented from the network. Only problem (for them) is that the guest wifi is throttled at 5MBps and now the kids are complaining to their dads/mums/anyonewhowilllisten about how the WiFi sucks. This means their parents can&#x27;t get any work done so they&#x27;re complaining to me to &quot;fix it&quot; so Johnny can run his games/app/movie without disturbing them.
 I&#x27;ve explained that we throttle to protect the work connection but twice I&#x27;ve been told to &quot;put them on the staff SSID&quot;. I&#x27;ve also explained the security risks associated with adding BYODs to the staff network and that this contravenes policy. 
 I&#x27;m not fearing an order to &quot;connect them anyway&quot; &#x27;coz I have the autonomy/authority to reject that order but I am concerned about generating a hostile work environment. 
 I could increase the throttle to 10Mb. Short of that, any other ideas?

                              <span>Basically the title
 I hear horror stories about the big names like SAP and Oracle. I personally dislike Mircosoft, seeing as both Teams and Microsoft 11 are dogshit.
 The company where I currently work is in the midst of sacking up in order to move on from the truly hideous &quot;ERP&quot; system we currently use. I&#x27;ve posted about it before, but it&#x27;s some partially-aborted, terribly maintained IBM AS/400 continuation. It contains our pricing, inventory, shipping, point of sale, manufacturing data, and lots of other info that I&#x27;m not currently privy to (working on it, but the disorganization of data is a whole other problem).
 I don&#x27;t hate the Salesforce portion that our sales team uses, and I understand it has a fairly robust API ecosystem. 
 Does anyone have resources to research or any experience switching a(n) SME from a shit ERP to a less-shit one? The current solution is untenable, and our senior IT staff are getting quite senior. The underlying business (wholesale/distributing/manufacturing) is quite sound, so funding isn&#x27;t as much of an issue. Buy-in from senior management/board of directors is the bigger problem (as always). 
 We are a 100-500 person company, NA-based USA HQ with ~10 locations in USA and Canada, and our aging workforce is a threat to irreparable loss of institutional knowledge.
 Thanks in advance for any help.
 Edit: Consensus opinion seems to be that ERPs are just shit. Which is what I feared. Time to get the checkbook out and pray. If anyone can DM me a recommendation to a decent ERP change consultant, that would be nice

                              <span>End of the year review just came up and I’m given the option to choose. Searched the sub a bit for similar questions but I see both were given to most. Currently living in the Austin area and the title option is Sys Admin which is what I’ve been waiting for but I’d like more income. I know the title will pay off but the money would help with extra classes towards extra certs then a job hop. Just wondering if you had a choose what would you guys pick?
 Edit: I’m aware of the odd choice but this is normal around here apparently because it’s a private law firm. Clients are big on titles so they gave me the offer thinking I would go crazy over it. I’m taking the raise dropping the Jr. and leaving. Thanks guys.

 The new virtual guest has loads more processor and memory resources than it&#x27;s physical predecessor.
 Everything performs much faster apart from an accounting application which uses SQL express 2016.
 This is painfully slow.
 I know I can expect SQL to run slightly slower in a virtual environment but not this much..
 Does anyone have any ideas / insights

                              <span>Our team would like to set up a file server for around 100 users for back up, sync, sharing, and collaboration. 
 The standard solution is O365, GSuit or something like Box.com. The problem is, management doesn’t like transferring business data over to these companies. Solutions where the data remains on premise are preferred. I understand! 
 Nextcloud is usually considered in these scenarios. I am not an expert. I have used nextcloud for personal use, and still learning it (eg, learning about different installation options). I also read a lot about it online. I personally like the software, but from my experience in the past years, I am a bit worried about updates getting broken between major versions, security vulnerabilities with a complex PHP app, and bugs impacting user experience. The web interface will remain open to LAN. 
 Do you have any experience with nextcloud in a small business scenario? How secure, robust and reliable is it, as a working replacement to something like Box.com?
 Anyone deploys nextcloud in production?
 On the other hand, I see governments in Germany and France and various institutions use it. I suppose they audited and vetted the code before adopting it. If it’s good for them, it might be good for small businesses too.

                              <span>I was speaking with a friend in the field, and he says that their organization mandates them to turn off all internet facing systems during a Holiday Window like Thanksgiving, Christmas, etc. He says its to mitigate a possible cyber breach while IT is on Holiday. 
 Kinda thought it was curious that they do that. Does anyone else have procedures to turn off systems like that during holidays or a &quot;freeze&quot;? We personally don&#x27;t do it at my place of work - but thought it was really interesting.

                              <span>Hello everyone. I have a peculiar problem that needs solving. I have undertaken a project that requires data to be moved from multiple locations (let&#x27;s say 10 for example) to a Central storage server. The problem is that none of the locations will be online, and cannot be online ever, so data must be moved physically by transporting the disks to the central location and unloading the data to the server.
 The satellite locations will have RAID-1 storage pools of 2 disks. Each location will have 4 pools. So in total we have 40 pools of 80 disks that need to be transported to another location, somehow mounted and have all their data copied over to the storage server.
 This will need to happen every month for a year.
 Have you ever done something like this? How would you approach it?

 Data center will locate at first floor and from a design perspective, what are the consequences and drawbacks if the data center is located in the corner of the facility on the floor and one side of the walls facing the public road.

 Apparently not if you are likeable person by C-levels.

 It&#x27;s not ipv6 for sure. No pings back on that, or it&#x27;s disabled.

                              <span>Hi,
 as the title said, I started working on a company half year ago. I am not 100% working for them but for a client. I don&#x27;t received any call, and just 1-2 emails weekly and is for the whole company. They gave me a phone with a SIM. My original phone just broke and needed one. So that&#x27;s why I ask that, if I use my personal SIM, can they spy my phone or just if I use the company sim?

                              <span>Situation: We purchased a new SAN from a big-name vendor three years ago. Our SAN reaches EOS early next year. We ain’t that stupid to self-support it, so we applied for the renewal last week. We received a quote from the vendor and to our astonishment, it’s around 20% of what we paid initially. For just one year! 
 Question(s): What’s a typical price for the support contract? Should we expect extended hardware maintenance included? How is HCI different from SAN? In case we’ll decide to switch to HCI, which is another option we consider.

                              <span>I look at SSL vpn configurations for the Juniper SRX. The configurations they give are for single boxes.
 Just wondering how remote access solutions are managed at scale across a company fleet of firewalls. Does Juniper just not have a good answer for it? I mean there&#x27;s security director, but I feel like you still are just managing the boxes and policy individually.
 I haven&#x27;t looked at other vendor solutions. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone can point me to some kind of vendor neutral design or point me to some vendor specific solution.

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I’m looking to fix this network that has recently landed on my desk and might need some assistance to make sure what I’m thinking will actually work. Hoping to resolve remotely (and with minimal downtime) as the site is a few hours drive away. 
 There’s currently 2 Fortigates in HA with an aggregate interface configured that has port 1 as a member, this connects to an aggregate on a Meraki stack (2 switches, port 1 on each switch - this is a single aggregate interface). From what I understand, HA syncs the config between the Fortigates so each Fortigate will have its own aggregate interface - it looks like when this was first configured it was thought that port 1 on each firewall would be a member of the single aggregate interface. Assuming this is correct, each aggregate on …</span>

                              <span>I hope I can describe this right...I work in IT, but do level 4 Desktop, with a basic networking background...I don&#x27;t really work from the panel. NoW, I need to. My terminology is not going to be right, so apologies. I am good with non business networking and wiring so I CAN understand.Can anyone theorize with me?
 This business is in what looks like condo&#x27;s. They will get ATT Fiber coming in, and will get a router with that. Beyond that, I can do whatever, but there IS existing wiring to the walls, both upstairs and down, to ethernet jacks, carrying cat 6.
 The existing backbone is The panel, Existing, is a punchdown block, telephone style ish. I don&#x27;t know the proper term. The ATT router will be left alone and installed as a stand alone piece, with wireless, but that&#x27;s not sufficient for wireless for the whole place.
 SO....From the ATT router, I would like to have 2 switches come right off of that. THEN, I would like to terminate the cat 6 with rj45 ends, THEN plug those into one switch for the upstairs and one for the down. I can&#x27;t see room to mount them, but It might be fine. There is NO give in the leftover from the block. THEN on each level, plug a wirless router into the switch to give better wireless.
 Beyond that, I am plugging 10-16 computers into each floor level at the wall, and one wired networked printer per level. I will manage the devices from the ATT router, but can do from each wireless router as well.
 I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not thinking of about 15 things.
 I&#x27;m trying to add a photo of the existing bloc, but this won&#x27;t let me?? I am attempting to draw this up for my own concept understanding as well. It&#x27;s going to take me a little while.
 Can anyone visualize this, and offer design advice? Am I at least on the right track?

                              <span>I work as a developer mostly on BGP protocol and having started directly as a developer, couldn&#x27;t the &#x27;big picture&#x27; view of networking in general, mostly about modern Data Center design. I want to invest sometime in learning about how the networks are designed probably from a practical perspective, as in, say, how would you design a data center, if you have say N number of servers, how many tiers in the leaf-spine topology you would prefer , which underlay to use, etc. I have a familiarity with Cisco NXOS and ACI and since aiming for a certification (CCIE, CCNP, DCACI etc) would probably encourage to continue the learning on a regular basis and also is a good target to aim for, does anyone here have suggestions on which certification track to consider or even which book I should start with. Thanks 
 [As a side-note, I even didn&#x27;t have enough clarity on what Bridge Domain is, why prefer one protocol over the other for underlay etc).

                              <span>I am an iperf noob.Based on iperf documentation,
 iperf -c  -n 1M -p 
 
 happens to send exactly 1M to server.
 However, if I want to send specific amount of bytes spread over say 2mins, then
 iperf -c  -p 
 -t 120 -i 5 
 In the above command, I want to send say 1GB over 2mins, which options would I have to use please?
 I have an example,
 [centos@ss-data-exp-sc1-vm02 ~]$ iperf -c  -p 25001 -l 4K -t 5 ------------------------------------------------------------ Client connecting to , TCP port 25001 TCP window size: 131 KByte (default) ------------------------------------------------------------ [ 3] local 10.2.19.0 port 58237 connected with 10.2.18.254 port 25001 [ ID] Interval Transfer Bandwidth [ 3] 0.0- 5.0 sec 922 MBytes 1.55 Gbits/sec 
 How to explain 922 Mb as part of &#x27;transfer&#x27; column?
 How to control transfer amount?

                              <span>Edit***I&#x27;ve figured out my method of looking at this isn&#x27;t going to happen. It&#x27;s not a network limitation it&#x27;s the software. There&#x27;s an online process and constant handshake that needs to be maintained and so my idea won&#x27;t work. But this has opened up other ideas that are theoretically easier. Appreciate the responses!!
 ***Original
 If I am a complete idiot for this line of thinking please don&#x27;t hesitate to let me know.
 I am currently running two identical separate networks (Main and Backup) each with only two machines on them - one &quot;controller&quot; and one &quot;server&quot;. These networks are very static both logically and physically. Always the same computers.
 Everything is on the same subnet and the controllers can be any IP I want but the servers have to be the same IP. If they&#x27;re not the same IP I have to do a ridiculous amount of reconfiguring every time I copy things from Main to Backup.
 Here&#x27;s my question:
 Is there a way I can send the same TCP/IP to two identical networks or IP addresses?
 I was thinking about getting a 4-port mini PC and trying to use PureData to create a routing system and trying to use Mac addresses but maybe there&#x27;s an easier way? Or maybe this won&#x27;t ever work at all (because of what I say next)?
 I realize this is a situation that networking is generally designed to avoid but this isn&#x27;t a typical data network - it&#x27;s a live show TCP/IP based control network with no external connections and/or surprises. I&#x27;m hoping I can find a way to make this work!

                              <span>So, we&#x27;re a small animation studio. We have a number of workstations in our studio all working from a series of QNAP servers on a 10g network.
 During lockdown, like many companies, we suddenly needed a good way for animators to work from home. We used Parsec initially as a stop-gap, until one of our freelancers put us together a better system which we&#x27;ve been using since. That&#x27;s great, but we&#x27;ve now come to totally depend on this system, and the only person who knows how it works is that one freelancer, who is also chronically unavailable. Not a great position to be in.
 So, I&#x27;m looking for recommendations for a replacement to the below system, vaguely cobbled together from my not-a-network-engineer level of knowledge based on what I THINK our current system does. I&#x27;m looking for somethin…</span>

                              <span>So in summer we have finally met the requirements to apply for a Google cache. And our link to Google is unfortunately very prone to fiber cuts.
 So we have applied for a Google cache.
 And at first they told us to wait two weeks. Then a month of silence. Then they told us to wait another month. They have stalled us for a total of 3 months now. And now they have finally given us a solid answer. Apparently they are &#x27;re-evaluating the entire Google cache program&#x27;. And that we will get a definitive answer by the end of the year 
 Anyone know what &#x27;re-evaluating the entire Google cache program&#x27; means for organisations that want to participate in it?

                              <span>Our business model is a little different than most which has resulted in now processing over $100,000 in rev per month and still using spreadsheets. Its gotten out of hand and unbearable (just the damn glitching is one main reason). The reason is we have very specific things we need that google sheets does well, does anyone know a CRM that can do all of the below (we use freshdesk for CS already so covered there)
 ​
 1) Auto import orders as soon as they are made (hopefully every CRM)
 2) Attach photos to a specific order (be able to upload different images directly on a clients order that can be seen by employees)
 3) Have different bench marks employees can check off on each order (submitted to suppliers, order approved, declined)
 4) Be able to send emails for updates on a specific order (remind X employee to check this order again in 3 days, remind me to check for X in 5 days for this order)
 5) Easy to use and a design that will make all of the above easy to do
 ​
 if someone can recommend a CRM that can do this all I will be especially happy and maybe offer a small reward :) thanks everyone

                              <span>I’ve spent 15+ years as a sysadmin with a couple different orgs and over the past two years moved quickly through the mgmt track (first manager now director). While the team is hitting all the right notes (in fact exceeding expectations in some areas), I’m not sure I want it. I’m feeling burned out and the farther I get from ‘mashing the keys’ the more unhappy I seem to be. Has anyone else experienced this? I’ve just received an offer to go back to a more technical role and kind of feel a bit of the golden handcuffs as the offer is 20% less. For those of who have felt this, did you go back to making a bit less coin for more of a happiness play?

                              <span>Hi, all!
 I&#x27;m in a competition called CCDC (Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition), which puts you in a &quot;Real&quot; business, and has tasks(keeping a server and webpage up), patching your firewall, &quot;setting up&quot; printers, and other day to day stuff while under attack from Red Hats. All that just to say, I was looking for advice and help in finding services online/books that can assist me in preparing for this competition. 
 I&#x27;ve started doing some CTF stuff, learning from hackthebox academy, stack overflow, my team mates, and coaches.
 I personally will be monitoring the network(ports open, network traffic, services running, and firewalls) and any resources that covers that would be amazing. 
 Edit start: The OS is released a week before the start, but most the time it&#x27;s a well known distribution of linux(normally ubuntu) and/or Windows Servers.
 This competition isn&#x27;t until February, so I have a bit of time to learn!
 Edit end.
 Thanks!
 (sorry if this is the wrong group, real nervous to post anything online 0-0)

                              <span>Hi there,
 Not a sysadmin, looking for some thoughts on a high quality kinda future proof, 10g switch for the following gear for mainly file sharing.
 - Up to 10 x 10g users (Mostly 10GBase-t because of short distance and our current NICs, I didn&#x27;t know SFP runs cooler otherwise that&#x27;d been my choice for nics in the past, such as shame)
 - IXsystems All flash Truenas R20 with dual 10G Base_t (Once fully loaded can support more throughput and possibly can upgrade nics to dual 25g or more)
 Options:
  
S5860-20SQ (Seems packed with features, good price and expandability, I like how it has support for 25g and 40g which my truenas might need in the near future. But it needs transivers for my current RJ45 equipment)
 HPE Aruba Instant On 1960 12XGT (I guess software/support is better than FS, not sure? Has both copper and fiber)
 Cisco Business 350 (I didn&#x27;t hear good things about it on reddit, seems like not really enterprise quality cisco)
 QNAP QSW-M1208-8C or similar. No comments, I have one and it worked well in a different gear. It&#x27;s cheaper than the others but I don&#x27;t want the cheapest now. I want the most reliable that has room for growth.
 CRS312-4C+8XG-RM Lots of great features and it&#x27;s cheap but again cost is not my main concern

                              <span>Ok, I’m dealing with some super old systems I need to migrate from Nutanix to ESX. The reason is the Nutanix block is so freaking old it’s massively failing. Like I told them 2 years ago they needed to get off this shit as it was showing issues, we couldn’t even get extended support, and everything else in shop is esx.
 We’ll I’m running in to an issue now that seems to be server 2008r2 + VMware tools related.
 On all these systems when installing vmwaretools 12.X+ everything seems to work, but if the server hasn’t been used in a bit it takes a moment for the network to “wake up”. What I mean is that if you log on to the console you’ll need to do a ping -t and let it fault for 10-15 times before it starts responding and then works fine from there on out. I tried the last supported version of tools I could find, 11.3, but this didn’t seem to rectify the issue.
 I’ve also made sure to remove the Nutanix guest tools and everything I could think of that might be interfering.
 I’m not seeing this behavior on why if the 2012R2, 2016, win10, etc…. VMs I’ve migrated. Just the 2008R2. 
 Anyone ran in to this before or have any ideas?

                              <span>Okay so looking for a bit of advice here I&#x27;ve previously done roles where I was the sole IT support for the site, which was fine, I always was able to escalate if needed:
 Currently joined an international company where various IT roles are segmented, I&#x27;m (IT Ops) but we have a production network team, a internal network team, infra team, AD/Exchange team, even a procurement team all within IT. (When I joined I thought great!) 
 The issue I have is I&#x27;m currently running 3 projects which require communication accross multiple teams, and sometimes even simple tasks like shared mailbox setup take forever as they come to me first, and instead of just doing it.. I have to send it to the messaging team, then have no visibility of the case, so chasing up what I can&#x27;t see for a relatively simple case becomes a headache. 
 On the other hand one of the other projects involves Setting up bespoke software (provided by the vendor) on a server provided by the production network team (None of whom are based in my country) and I cannot even install the software as their server is on their network, and their vlan that I have no access to, RDP copy paste is disabled etc 
 This meant I had to log a case with them to request them to open SMB traffic/share to our network so I can transfer the files. To which they said no. And then messaged my boss asking what was taking so long... 
 This isn&#x27;t really a rant, some of the teams mentioned above are very helpful (rather some if their members are) and I have a good working relationship with them, however the above is a regular occurrence. 
 Basically I&#x27;m looking for advice on how other people manage this if they are in the same situation, or any tips, cheers in advance!

 I really need to bump that up. They want $10 per mb for a 500mb line. 
 Is this really what this shit costs these days? 10 dollars per mb or $5,000 a month for a 500gb line? I feel IGF.

                              <span>Some time ago, I wanted to automatically set an Out of Office to disabled accounts in my org, something rather easy to do when you are good with powershell, however I am not that good, and even with my googling skills, I couldn&#x27;t find a script that actually worked the way I wanted.
 Then I asked ChatGPT and... the answer was perfect.
 This is what I had after asking &quot;How can I automatically set up out of office messages for disabled accounts in a specific OU ?&quot; :
  # Replace &quot;OU&#x3D;Disabled Accounts,DC&#x3D;contoso,DC&#x3D;com&quot; with the distinguished name of your OU $ou &#x3D; &quot;OU&#x3D;Disabled Accounts,DC&#x3D;contoso,DC&#x3D;com&quot; # Get a list of disabled accounts in the OU $disabledAccounts &#x3D; Get-ADUser -Filter {Enabled -eq $False} -SearchBase $ou # Set the out-of-office message for each disabled account foreach ($account in $disabledAccounts) { Set-MailboxAutoReplyConfiguration -Identity $account.SamAccountName -AutoReplyState Enabled -ExternalMessage &quot;I am currently out of the office and will not be able to respond to your message. I will get back to you as soon as possible.&quot; -InternalMessage &quot;I am currently out of the office and will not be able to respond to your message. I will get back to you as soon as possible.&quot; } 
 Now, I know the tool isn&#x27;t flawless, however, have you guys considered using it just like you do with Google to solve these kind of things ?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been using Robocopy (RC) for many years... so long I don&#x27;t want to say. That said, I am currently running a copy on a Windows 11 machine with its version of RC that comes preinstalled. I started noticing my /PURGE /NOCOPY options on batch command lines didn&#x27;t seem to be working the same anymore. (subdirs were no longer being purged) So I added /S /E and it started copying zillions of files &amp; directories instead of removing files. I verified there were a lot of new folders I did not want there, that weren&#x27;t there prior to changing those parameters. I removed the /E and tested again, it looked like it was creating new directories, but when I looked at the destination it wasn&#x27;t doing that anymore (like it think it should be working)
 I did see a blurb on the new Win11 RC version help page about them changing what happens on a certain system folder with /PURGE, but saw nothing about other changes to it.
 I did NOT go back and test older version, so maybe I only thought it was working and removing files from sub-folders if they weren&#x27;t on the source. Don&#x27;t know, and I won&#x27;t invest any more time in that.
 So now with the added /S, but no /E its removing files/folders in sub-directories like I wanted/expected and not copying stuff.
 The /E option on that /PURGE line really screws the pooch! JFYI. -Bill

                              <span>Hi
 I was following come Cisco instructions to setup unified messaging to use OAuth2 authentication. Part of the process was to assign the Application Impersonation management role to the unified messaging services account. 
 I ran this command 
 New-ManagementRoleAssignment -Name:  -Role:ApplicationImpersonation -User:&#x27;  &#x27;
 After running, I ran a Get-ManagementRoleAssignment and I can see the role name and account, but under RoleAssigneeName and EffectiveUserName , I&#x27;m getting what looks like an object ID instead of what I was expecting to see...which was an email address. 
 I&#x27;m note sure if it was because I didn&#x27;t use the quotes for the account...I used User: 
 instead of User:&#x27;  &#x27;
 I&#x27;m an extreme newbie when it comes to powershell so I&#x27;ve got the following questions:
  
Is this even a problem?
 is it the lack of quote marks that caused this?
 Are there commands I can run to change these to the email address?
  
Thanks in advance.

 When creating an SMB share you are specifying which AD user/groups should have access to it. Then there is &quot;Advanced Share permissions&quot; thats asks you to AGAIN specify which AD user/groups should have access to it. What am I missing here?

 We at FilesNow are in the process of developing a new file sharing and storage service, and we&#x27;re looking for some feedback and suggestions from the sysadmin community.
 What are some key features that you look for in a file sharing and storage service? In your experience, what has made a file sharing service stand out to you?
 We are aiming to create a service that is reliable, easy to use, and has good security features. Some other features that we&#x27;re considering include the ability to share files with external collaborators, integration with other tools and platforms, and the ability to manage permissions and control access to files. Additionally, we want to offer robust file storage capabilities, including the ability to store and access large files, as well as support for various file formats.
 We&#x27;d love to get your thoughts on what features would be most useful for sysadmins and what would make our file sharing and storage service stand out in the market.
 Thanks in advance for your help!

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ll get right into my question:
 I&#x27;ve been working for 1 company for ~1,5 years by now. 6 months as anykey, 10 as system administrator. We have a small team of 3 people: me, lead system administrator and team leader. Company consist of 100 people in architecture department and about 100 in first-line tech support.
 Soo, I really like my job, my team have amasing chemistry, I can do almost all tasks independently, but I think that I&#x27;m sitting on the same place in terms of knowledge. All of our servers are almost 100% windows-based, and I do usually some simple things like managing users in AD, some share-server based stuff and of course managing problems with user&#x27;s pc, but nothing extraordinary.
 And what I&#x27;m thinking that if I tried to switch a job now, I wouldn&#x27;t pass an interview. I know how to do things but it is usually limited and on sense-based level rather solid knowledge.
 I&#x27;m feeling like I&#x27;m back on square one when I haven&#x27;t got a job at all and I waster 1,5 years for nothing. 
 In advance I&#x27;ll say that I try to learn new things of course, I try to make a note in Obsidian daily about networking and so on, but I can admit that I&#x27;m really not the brightest system administrator, so many things are quite hard for me.
 My question is it really I have imposter syndrome or is it a normal state? And, I know it is hard to give answer to that, what can I do to improve me so I can be valuable asset on a market?
 ​
 Many thanks in advance, and sorry for any possible language mistakes - I tried to catch them all, but who knows)

                              <span>I tried WCD for the first time last week. Just used the basic mode. Added wifi, domain join and a few apps. All went well apart from domain joining which only worked on Ethernet. The WiFi deets are correct because users can sign in immediately after provisioning is finished. The only thing I can think is happening is that it tries to domain join before adding the WiFi profile?

                              <span>Hey guys! Here&#x27;s my setup,AD DC----RADIUS----aruba AP cluster (Virtual Controller) -----client
 This setup was working perfectly fine for a long time. Client authenticates through RADIUS with his / her AD UN PW to wifi. No config changes were done afterwards. Recently some of the clients started complaining not being able to connect to wifi. This was fixed with a simple RADIUS server reboot. Then the issue became persistent. Now nobody can connect to wifi. I checked the RADIUS event log and apparently it cannot connect to AD (DC). But they both are in the same subnet, and I can ping the AD (DC) from RADIUS server. No firewall restrictions. I cannot figure out where the problem is. If someone can please point me in the right direction that&#x27;ll be helpful. TIA.
 &quot;Audit Failure
 Event ID: 6274
 Reason Code: 5
 Reason: The Network Policy Server was unable to connect to a domain controller where the account is located. Because of this, authentication and authorization for the RADIUS request could not be performed.&quot;

                              <span>We have some Cisco M5 servers that are running ESXi. These servers have 2 x X710 Dual Port NICs. We are noticing that in some of our load tests, we start seeing our dropped packets start to increment. When we dump the nic statistics in ESXi, we see Rx Missed counters are increasing. Someone told us that the Ring Buffers were dropping packets, and that the solution was to enable Receive Side Scaling (RSS). So we looked into that. 
 Inside of the ESXi operating system (VMWare proprietary Linux), the adaptors are using a driver named i40en. The driver is loaded as a kernel module. Per VMWare docs, enabling RSS involves passing parameters to the kernel module. We noticed there were two RSS Parameters (DRSS and RSS), which led us down a path of trying to figure out which one we needed to be configuring. We learned that there are two types of Receive Side Scaling: NetQ (RSS), and Default Queue RSS, the latter being newer. Since we didn&#x27;t see any mention of DRSS in the Intel X710 documentation, we proceeded to set the RSS values to 4 queues per adaptor. We re-ran the test expecting a Eureka result, but nope - we still see the Rx Missed. 
 On this issue, we keep flapping between VMWare (who owns the OS), Cisco (who owns the server) and Intel (who makes the X710 adaptor). Can anyone shed any insight on this Rx Missed issue, and point us in a direction to go down that might fix this issue? We have to figure this out before we can allow a service to be rolled out.

                              <span>I recently had to merge Nokia and Juniper networks and it was a hot mess of learning. I finally have a working build with OSPF as the IGP and RSVP signaled LSPs connecting epipes into l2circuits. I found it strange that the official documentation on both sides said that it wasn’t possible it works just fine when you add proper compensation. I’m sure smarter people than myself have done it in the past but I’m very proud of my config. Anybody else ever deal with trying to merge entire networks like that.

                              <span>I am building a hobby service that can host user&#x27;s containerized applications on request. These must be publicly accessible. After some googling I came to conclusion that there is no way around having to own a range of IP addresses that I can assign to individual hosted applications. However, it seems that getting a range of addresses is both too hard and expensive and probably impossible for an individual (I do not want to create a company just for a hobby service). For example, my RIR is APNIC and the membership application requires corporate contacts.
 What is the easiest way to obtain a range of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses as an individual?

                              <span>All of a sudden, a certain ap site very inconsistently loads the guest portal redirect when connecting to guest network, other sites are unaffected. Most devices don&#x27;t load at all. Just updated to v10 of firmware, was on v6. Further testing needed. Just curious if the community had input on this issue. Ticket submitted to mist support which if you have dealt with them before, can take a long time to get a response.

                              <span>Hi, I have 1 firewall and 2 switches I have been working with. The firewall is pfsense and the 2 switches are a fortiswitch and a juniper ex. 
 I configured a trunk port from the fortiswitch to the pfsense firewall with native vlan 1 and allowed(tagged) vlan 20. This works as expected. I can still access the switch on the default network, and I can add vmware vms to vlan 20 and everything works as expected.
 However, I cannot replicate this on my Juniper. I attempted the same configuration (trunk port with native vlan 1 and tagged vlan 20) but when I do this I can no longer access the switch IP nor ping it (it doesnt appear to work on either 1 or 20). What am I missing that I need to configure for this to work on my Juniper? 
 Below is the output on the interface being used as the trunk.
 show interfaces mge-0/0/47.0 family ethernet-switching { interface-mode trunk; vlan { members [ 20 default ]; } native-vlan-id 1; storm-control default; }

                              <span>So we had our company (law firm) Christmas party. While our IT department is a coworker and I + our boss who mainly does infrastructure, we are a company with a single office and about 160 people so until now we got by. Today the CEO dropped the bomb that we will expand from 1 to 3 offices over 12 months with around 40-50 new people for the new offices.
 My coworker and I are in the middle of organising and redesigning many processes and polices, together with a new infrastructure for a new software and implementing an intranet so 2023 was already packed. With the news we have to do the work that we planned on padding out over the year (also to be able to do our day to day tasks) in the next 4 months so we can develop solutions to our new issues with having more than 1 office (most of our infrastructure is in our local server rooms so we have to think if this will suffice).
 I am genuinely scared of the sudden rise in scope (neither our grown infrastructure nor our company policies and culture are, as of today, fit for the new environment), but also excited to not only execute the plan but also co-developing that plan

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a client who happens to be a CPA. There are apparently some new regulations on CPA&#x27;s with regards to data security and they apply to this use case. This accountant uses an Android tablet to connect to their office computer via screen sharing through Google Chrome remote desktop. He wants to replace this with a VPN solution. I&#x27;m wondering what you all would recommend. Thanks in advance!

Something up to $100 each that an IT person would like. So far Google has come up with the usual mugs, candles, fruit baskets, chargers, pop sockets, etc. What would you like to get it have received in the past that you liked?

                              <span>I surprisingly couldn&#x27;t find a script for this anywhere, so I wrote one myself.
 This script recursively converts all .rar and .zip archive files to the superior .7z format, set for highest compression.
  
Can specify formats to convert (in the VARIABLES section in the top of the script). Defaults are .rar and .zip
 
After each file is converted, the original archive is deleted, leaving only the new .7z archive
 
Logs by default to c:\logs\ (can be changed in the VARIABLES section)
 
Starts from the directory it was launched from and recurses down subdirectories from that point
 
 &gt;&gt; Script on Github &lt;&lt;
 I used this script to convert a lot of old log files we&#x27;re required to keep around from Zip to 7-Zip, which saved ~380 GBs of space by the time it was done.

 HP T740 does it with optional graphics card but I cannot find a SKU/model number for this option.
 I know this is easier with a workstation &amp; graphics card but that’s the last resort.

                              <span>So I finally implemented MFA two weeks ago for our company after having a &#x27;battle&#x27; with management for over two years. Everything went fine and already 95% of our users have set it up.
 This week I got a message when signing in to the Azure portal that there was a new conditional access policy created. I checked the CA policies and saw that a new &#x27;Require MFA for admins&#x27; policy was created. In the logs it said this was done by an admin account of our MSP who does some support work for us.
 We didn&#x27;t get noticed or gave the MSP an assignment to set this up. So I messaged our contact at the MSP and after some research from their side they say the CA policy was created automatically without their intervention.
 I can see clearly in the logs that their admin account created the CA policy but I&#x27;m not too experienced with Azure and CA policies. Is automatically creating a CA policy with MFA even possible in Azure AD?

 We have 2019 core with hyper-v role, bitlocker encrypts OS and storage volumes. We have dozens all over the continent, solution has worked for years without issue.
 This month we’ve ran into an problem with some new builds. We use MDT to deploy, task sequences are vanilla and no settings have been changed. OS disk is fine. Data disk is not auto unlocking. If you log in with a domain account and try access Data Disk D: you get a warning saying to go into control panel (fat chance on core!) to unlock. Manage-bde Status has Auto Unlock as disabled, Key Protectors : external key …</span>

 My boss instructed me to setup one email &quot;Office365&quot; for four users, and he wants the users to log in without knowing their password.
 I saved the password into their browsers however this is not safe and the users can grab the saved password from the browser settings.
 There are solutions can be configured and available to force the user to sign in without using the email credentials.

 Some people say their IP geolocation is wrong, but even if it’s not accurate, as long as it’s consistent, it could still be useful if you get a notification showing a login attempt from a new IP address in a completely different location.
 Some users may not like it even if it’s accurate because they will feel like their employer is tracking their movements.

                              <span>Hi. We are a small MSP who took over a client from another MSP that was using Threat Locker. The old MSP refuses to remove the product from the machines because of a dispute with the client and the MSP. 
 I reached out to Threat Locker support to see about how to remove their product when tamper protection is enabled. They said it cannot be done. They provided me this link https://threatlocker.kb.help/uninstalling-the-threatlocker-agent/ however it doesn&#x27;t help if you don&#x27;t have access to the old MSP&#x27;s portal to disable tamper protection. Has anyone run into this issue? Is there a way to boot into safe mode and rip this product out of the system and registry, offline if needed?

                              <span>I posted earlier in the week about the lack of technical questions in my 1st interview. The next day got word the company wanted to do a 2nd interview. 2nd interview was with the Executive IT and another manager from a different department. 
 They were big on team work, working together, and being able to think critically within a team environment. I then realized that I painted a picture that I do most of my work alone (which is mostly true) but I highlighted times in my past &amp; current roles that I worked in a team setting so they understood that I can do the work but more than happy and ready to work with like-minded ppl and have that transfer of knowledge that I was not getting in my current role. I got that squared away and closed the interview feeling that I was able to convey &quot;hey I can do the job and I miss working within a team environment with like-minded ppl and I am ready to learn and put in the work&quot;
 I received my offer later that evening. They wanted to make sure I would fit well within the 9 person team and be willing to learn. 
 Thanks everyone who mentioned softskills are important. I am now a Network Administrator!

We live off the beaten path to say the least, and I am the first dedicated Network Admin they have had in 5-10 years. My wife is a teacher so it was a perfect match for them to get me into the schools and help them out with stuff, and her as a teacher.
 Last year, the construction of a new high school was completed in the community. The planning for it predated my employment, so IT didn&#x27;t have a dedicated space for our desks or storage. The server room is buried deep in the bowels of the school, behind the fitness room and on the way to electrical; no windows, and no space for desks. Just a tightly packed room with the racks in the middle. Therefore, we were given a classroom space. At this point, I should clarify a f…</span>

 ​
 I&#x27;m looking into build a sort of &quot;sysadmin library&quot; and I wanted to get the book Unix and Linux System Administration Handbook but I see the last edition is from back in 2017.
 Is it still a good buy now that we are about to be in 2023? 
 Kind regards.

                              <span>This is about 20% Outlook rant and 80% wanting to share the laugh I had this morning. 
 We use O365 and I&#x27;m constantly struggling to keep up with the new features M$ decides we want. If something particularly useless or potentially confusing to users shows up I&#x27;ll usually track down the GPO to disable it.
 Today a user came into my office to report a problem with her email reactions. I didn&#x27;t know what she was talking about. She proceeded to show me that a couple weeks ago a new emoji button showed up alongside her Forward and Reply buttons in Outlook. I told her I&#x27;d look into it but that it sounds like a pointless new feature some people might have a little bit of fun with when it eventually rolls out to the rest of the company. 
 I could tell this response had more of an impact than the brush-off response I intended it to be - she then explained she had stopped sending replies to the majority of the emails she received from her team, opting to instead hit the &#x27;Thumbs Up&#x27; emoji to indicate that their messages were seen and approved. I can only assume people thought they were being ignored. For weeks. 
 I also haven&#x27;t been able to enable this feature on my own Client. I have Preview Mode on and am on the most up to date build.

                              <span>We just onboarded a new customer at my MSP and they had literally nothing in form of IT. Everyone is in a workgroup, no server, and no AD whether it be on-prem or Azure. We are slowly getting them up to speed. We have the new server and domain in place and all the computers are joined to that domain. 
 Currently, all of their data is in Dropbox. They are wanting to move from Dropbox to their new on-prem server because their Dropbox business account is getting pricey as they grow. Does Dropbox have any special migration tool like Sharepoint does or do I simply just download all of their data onto the server from Dropbox?
 I just did a few google searches and every article talks about moving from on-prem TO Dropbox.

They open any Office app and the Active Office box comes up, they enter their e-mail then another box comes up saying &quot;Sign in to get started with Office&quot;. You can sign in and again or skip sign in. If they try and sign in it goes back to this box in a loop. Some details, all of our users have Office x64, Windows 10 Enterprise mostly 21H2 and Hybrid AD Joined. I&#x27;ve tried running the MS SARA tool that fixes activation issues, didn&#x27;t work. There is no entry for an Office credential in credential manager to delete. We are using MFA in our environment. It&#x27;s affecting a small amount of users but we&#x27;ve yet to find a fix.

                              <span>I have oopised hard.
 I was working on a script to more easily add domains to the email block list in M365 Defender/Policies &amp; Rules/THreat Policies/ Anti-spam Policies
 However - what I actually did was replace the existing block list with the example I wanted to add.
 I&#x27;m now going to make a big assumption - that Microsoft actually back up your setttings somewhere and it&#x27;s possible to restore from a previous version.
 If this assumption is correct, how do I do it?

 We currently have an issue with our SAN storage, as the issue is that one of the SP&#x27;s is losing access to the volume.
 Currently we have two switches setup for redundancy within our environment, and one EMC connecting to the two fibre switches as mentioned. The EMC is having difficulties connecting to our switches across one of the SP&#x27;s connected.
 We have SP-A and SP-B, both of these are exact replicas of each other, using the same fibre cabling and SFP&#x27;s, they are both configured the same to each other. However we are having issues with connections of SP-A. We are continually seeing the below error across SP-A.
 &quot;Lost access to volume 638f3632-e929b695-29a2-b49691e7e836 (VM Store 01) due to connectivity issues. Recovery attempt is in progress and outcome will be reported shortly.

 esx.problem.vmfs.heartbeat.timedout&quot;
 We are using Dell EMC and IBM switches - Dell EMC is hosting 3 EXSi hosts which all have difficulties with SP-A, however with SP-B they connect correctly

                              <span>I&#x27;ll try keep this brief. My goal is to eventually become an SWE, and I&#x27;ve spent the last ~2 years self-teaching via Udemy courses, Harvard CS50, and other similar resources, learning Python, some JS, a very small amount of SQL.
 All of my professional work experience to date is in the automotive/customer service industry. The last several years I&#x27;ve been an automotive Service Advisor at a dealership in a wealthy area. I&#x27;m no stranger to difficult/entitled people and how to deal with them. I see this as one of my skill sets that may set me apart from others trying to enter the field. So with this in mind, I&#x27;ve shifted gears over the last several months a bit more toward the SysAdmin side to earn my A+ certification, and just this week I earned my Network+ and CIOS badges.
 My reasons for this are:
  
Develop some more foundational knowledge of how hardware/software/networking work because having a greater understanding of that can obviously be helpful.
 Have something concrete to put on my resume other than &quot;I&#x27;ve been watching a lot of videos and practicing&quot;.
 As stated above, entering IT on the SysAdmin side may be a clearer path to getting into IT for me, given my background.
  
MAIN TLDR QUESTIONS;
  
Is it common for people hoping to become developers to enter via help desk or similar role, then transition to SWE? Or is it generally better to pick one patch and go all in?
 Should I go for my Security+ and get the &quot;trifecta&quot; before throwing applications out? This leads me to the next bullet point
 I&#x27;m supporting a family of 5, and my wife does not currently work because our children are still young and not all in school yet. I need to make $80k+ to be able to afford our monthly expenses. Is it feasible for someone without a degree to enter the field making that kind of money? I&#x27;m in central Maryland, so the median salary is certainly above average for the US.
  
Any and all advice appreciated. TIA

                              <span>A authentication method which check for repetition of a key to a certain value . 
 For example: I have a number in mind, it can be any number (lets assume 4513)
 For validation:
 I have to first press a certain key (it can be any key doesn&#x27;t matter) 4 times
 then another key (again doesn&#x27;t matter what key it is , it just have to be different from the first key pressed) 5 time
 then another key (again any other key but different then the other two) 1 time
 and again another key (again any key but different than previous used keys) 3 times
 This might be a very stupid idea and unsecured (i don&#x27;t really have any experience in this field) but I am very curious if something like this exists out there or not.

                              <span>We have users who are having some printing issues with a HP printer. As shown in the picture here: 
 https://imgur.com/a/eYDQnoi
 The HP appears to have the wrong driver listed next to its name (blue underline) - It&#x27;s matching the Brother driver (red underline). Even if I remove the printer and readd it with a different version driver it still shows the 10.0.17xxx version which belongs to the Brother printer.
 I&#x27;ve searched forums etc but nothing appears to solve this issue. I have even extracted the working driver from my machine (I added it manually to test the correct driver) and &#x27;replaced&#x27; it on the PRTServer. 
 Has anyone seen this before and if so, how did you resolve it?!
 Thanks in advance

 The button (and Modify) is greyed out for every app in the list. However, logging on to a local administrator account that&#x27;s *not* a domain user it is available.
 The only relevant domain GPO that might be affecting it is &#x27;Prevent Uninstall from Start&#x27; but I set that to disabled in local GPO and no change.
 I even tried Procmon64 to see if I could nail down a reg key or something but nothing so far. Nothing online about this either.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen several articles like this one stating that more younger &quot;GenZ&quot; workers are feeling stressed about tech issues. I&#x27;m not in a role where I can really see if this trend is present where I&#x27;m at. 
 I have always had the assumption that the younger crowd was better with newer tech, but may struggle with older systems. My generation (GenX) grew up building their own PCs and doing a ton of stuff &quot;from scratch&quot; like creating boot disks and having to actually install a TCP/IP stack. 
 Now though you can grab an iPhone or iPad and they just work for 90% of the things you want like email, web and messaging. If you&#x27;re heavy into social media you may not even use a browser much as things like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. all have apps.
 I supposed you could blame the fact that since these newer things work so well that skills like troubleshooting and figuring things out by building them have withered. 
 Anyone have any anecdotal takes on this?

                              <span>Awhile ago I switched a few, dual 1GbE NIC, servers to using crossovers to reduce the network load. They run a distributed app and there’s no reason for that traffic to cross a switch.
 I want to upgrade that server-to-server link to 25GbE. I’m looking at the AOC-S25G-m2S. But I’ve never tried doing a server-to-server connection using a SFP28 DAC before.
 Assuming I know how to configure the interfaces in software, will using a SFP DAC cable just work?

 Hardware: HP EliteDesk 800 G2 DMP Mini Core i5-6500T @ 2,5 GHz 8GB RAM DDR4 SSD Windows 10
 NIC in question: Intel(R) Ethernet Connection (2) I219-LM
 Scenario: I am running a headless Win10 mini PC on a remote location, connected over residential fiber with a home gateway. I run OpenVPN on it and use remote desktop to access the machine remotely.
 Now, as home gateways are flaky, and my IP anyway changes every 24 hours, I have set up a very simple way of ensuring the connectivity comes back up: I have a programmable wall plug which cuts the power to the home gateway every morning at 3am for a minute. This ensures that if the home gateway locks up, latest the next day it&#x27;ll come back up.

 We are a small business (4 ppl IT team) with a &quot;managed IT&quot; infrastructure from an external service and the systems are co-managed with the internal IT. Albeit not being full-fledged sysadmins, we started off long a go setting up and managing ourselves the infrastructure with a simple traditional setup. With the business growing, we outgrew the initial setup and with less time to manage the infrastructure, we outsourced it and went through an overhaul of the infrastructure.
 So far so good, the needs were still small, we just had no time to handle the whole system administration, but we still provisioned our VMs\Datastores\Backup\etc from time to time. All in cooperation with the external service to not leave anyone behind with the changes we occasionally made…</span>

 We reach out to different healthcare professionals asking them for their consultation on important medical research topics such as COVID, cancer, diabetes etc. We constantly receive complaints that our emails are marked as spam and prevents them from being able to participate in the research studies. We pay ($$$) them for their time spent on research.
 We have setup all the mail standard configurations (sfp, dmarc, dkim). We have one click unsub which we honor in 24-hours, removed the users that don&#x27;t respond, but we are still getting blocked by some IT admins or random spam filter blocking our emails.
 Any suggestion from fellow mail/system admins on how to approach the IT to avoid getting blocked unfairly?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 Recently I&#x27;ve been tasked with enrolling bitlocker in our environment. As we don&#x27;t have AAD and introducing MBAM did not seem to be worth the effort for our small scale environment, we decided to create just the policy and then activate encryption manually via script per workstation. It suits our needs as we slowly switching from old computer vendor hodgepodge to standardized modern enterprise Dell workstations. The policy was thoroughly tested and I&#x27;ve determined it works and is safe to use company wide, then GPO was applied &quot;wide&quot; on almost all workstation containers. I was 100% sure nothing will happen because everywhere i looked GPO managed bitlocker need a manual trigger of some sorts to encrypt the drive by design. Just one day after policy rollout we noticed some of our new Latitude 3420 we gave to the users earlier in the week have bitlocker encryption active. Good thing recovery keys are present in AD but loosing the control of the process is major concern. It&#x27;s especially weird as it happen only to the latitude laptops. The optiplexes 3000 are behaving as expected. I&#x27;ve read about Dell OOBE bitlocker encryption but it shouldn&#x27;t effect us as we reimage all computers straight out of the box using WDS. Investigation of windows events gave me nothing to hold on to. It seems like one time event per host because once decrypted it wont happen again. My hypothesis is that WSD true&lt; is not clearing bitlocker partition containing some sort of residual Dell ransomware but it does not seem likely. 
 What are your thoughts?

 I know the SAS can go up to 12GB/s on the bus but read/write throughput is slower. Read/write times are faster in SSD but the bus maxes out at 6GB/s.

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;m doing some work in really furstratingly secured environment and I&#x27;d like to know if it&#x27;s possible to make a ssh tunnel through the following architecture:
 A Linux --rdp--&gt; B Windows --ssh--&gt; C Linux --ssh--&gt; D Linux
 I control A (my PC) and D (bastion VM) Getting the Ops team to install anything on B or C will take weeks and I have work to do so can&#x27;t really wait that long. 
 I&#x27;m not that comfortable with Windows so what I want to know is: is it even remotely possible to do a ssh tunnel through machine B even though I t doesn&#x27;t have the ssh-server installed?
 And before someone answers: don&#x27;t punch holes in your company&#x27;s security - there&#x27;s another company working on the same environment with much fewer security restrictions and I&#x27;m constantly getting complaints why are they doing things so much faster (idk Karen, maybe because they don&#x27;t need 15 minutes to manually transfer artefacts through 3 jumphosts and can use rsync and other sane tools).

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m a PKI administrator at a MSP and have to deal with certificates, CRLs and everything else on a daily basis (and 15+ years in experience). In order to take away the fear and insecurity of certificates from some of my colleagues, I would like to shoot a kind of promotion tour for certificates.
 However, in order to develop and create this, I first need to understand why many admins have a real fear of certificates. Is it because certificates have a defined expiration date, which cannot be jerked even in the event of a major disruption?
 Maybe you have some more ideas or can report from your daily admin life.

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 I&#x27;ve been in IT for 12 years, currently IT Manager/infrastructure engineer for a small business. The usual stuff from virtual servers, azure, AD, firewalls, iso27001 compliance, networking as well as a small amount of IT support.
 I&#x27;ve had a job offer with a considerable pay and perks bump (albeit current company have offered to match pay) to move into an auditor role, auditing a much bigger companies systems as part of a team. All around ISO27001. 
 Has anyone made the move? I&#x27;m aware it can be dry, but it seems less like people are going to be screaming at you when things go wrong which might be nice! I&#x27;d be interested to hear people&#x27;s thoughts as I&#x27;m very much on the fence. 
 Thanks,

                              <span>I was reviewing another post on this sub and noticed everyone has their own opinion on what device should perform L3 in the network - A core switch or firewall. 
 I understand that this greatly depends on size of the network, scalability, certification-requirements, etc. - but I want your input. I personally like using the firewall for a single pane-of-glass and ease-of-use.
 ​
 So - What do you think? Should L3 be managed on the firewall or at a core switch? Why? Change my mind!

                              <span>The price difference is ridiculous especially for the ER optics. I did some searching and didn&#x27;t see many comments on the 100G optics. Just wondering what kind of success/burn people have with them. To go with a &lt;3K optic and it burn you and have to replace it with 80K optics is a pretty big gut punch. Even Cisco branded optics fail, so some failure doesn&#x27;t scare me due to redundant links. I just don&#x27;t want to be constantly swapping them either or worry about MTTF&#x27;s lining up like you get with raid arrays.

                              <span>So i have this topology in a mininet emulation:
 h1/h2 ---- s2 ---- s1 ---- s3 ---- h3/h4
 All links are restricted to 1Gbps.
 When i use iperf3 to send TCP traffic from h1 to h3, it gets close to that bw and everything seems fine. When i create two concurrent flows that go e.g. from h1 to h3 or both from h1 to h3 and from h1 to h4, the bandwidth they get also adds up to close to 1Gbps.
 However, when i concurrently have a flow running from h1 to h3 and one from h2 to h4, their summarized bandwidth is way worse and almost never exceeds 300 Mbps.
 There are some more retransmissions shown in iperf3 in this last scenario as well, but i don&#x27;t really get why that is and i think that just the workings of congestion control causing a decrease of link utilization to below 30% seems unlikely.
 The retransmissions come in small bursts and those appear only every few seconds on average, which also seems too large of an in-between time to have me think that packet drops are causing this. This sounds more like timeouts, but then there should be quite some ACKs being dropped and why would that be?
 Cubic is configured on all end hosts. RTT measured by ping is mostly between 80 and 130 microseconds.
 Before i dig down further into the depths of congestion control (calculating timeouts and looking at whether the ACKs make it in time), i was wondering whether someone had any insights on whether that is normal behaviour or what else could be happening.
 Both memory and CPU utilization of any of the cores stay below 100%.

                              <span>I have been the network administrator for my company for the last 7 years. I am the only network administrator so we use consulting for signing off on large design/config changes. Just as a cya if ever audited. We recently purchased palo alto networks firewalls. They are just being used to protect some newer networks but I want to change this. I have my pcnse and have worked with them at other jobs. I am designing them into my network to handle all the traffic. I plan on using vsys to separate out protected systems, dmz, internet access and vpns. When I join the company we had 3 sets of firewalls. 1 for s2s vpns, 1 for protecting critical systems and another for dmz/internet traffic. All other internal routing is done by the core switch.

                              <span>We are considering upgrading our small environment to 4x HP DL360&#x27;s Gen10+, TrueNAS R10 storage array, and two 10 GigE core switches along with 3x 48-port POE+ switches with 10Gig uplinks to to the core switches. 
 Initial thought: Two Netgear M4300 with 12-port Copper (for the network traffic) and 12-port SFP+ DAC (for the storage traffic) but read that copper is hot and higher latency. So will get a switch with only SFP+ ports. DAC will be used in the server room and fiber to the 48-port switches that are through out the building.
 Does it make sense to just run a single SFP+ DAC from each server to each switch that will handle both network traffic and storage traffic or do I run two cables to each switch from each server and split the traffic? 
 I know Netgear is not enterprise grade hardware but $2,500 vs $12,000 for an Aruba 3810M seems like a major difference. Any vendors that are between the two as far as cost and feature set? For that price difference, I can have a spare Netgear on hand.
 For my DR site, I plan on having a duplicate TRUENAS R10 and 3x DL360&#x27;s servers and nothing else. Can I eliminate the switches entirely and just run 3 DAC cables to the TrueNAS and plug the 3 servers directly into my two Fortinet 80F firewalls via GigE?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello all, 
 I handle all of the IT infrastructure (End User Support, Sys Admin, Net Adm, etc.) and the current networking environment is running very old and EoL HP switches. I currently have a Fortigate 81f with HA installed with FortiManager. Along with that, we use FortiEMS and Forticlient for VPN, Anti-Virus, etc. I am considering the Fortiswitches. There is no inter VLAN happening, nothing layer 3, no PoE, just basic layer 2 routing. Keep in mind, this is for a small business, no larger than 60 employees. Would it be wise to switch to all Fortiswitches since I already have a Fortigate and Fortimanager? I had a demo and it was a huge difference compared to the current HP switches. 
 ​
 Has anyone used Fortiswtiches in a small business environment: no more than 10 switches. Are they reliable, dependable, or should I just stick with the big brands such as Cisco and Aruba? 
 Thanks for your feedback!

                              <span>Clarification: I know that pseudowire is a specific thing: a transparent, multipoint and redundant backhaul that encapsulates other protocols to allow them to operate as if they were on a native P2P network.
 In my long history, pseudowire has essentially been two things: MPLS MetroE/MAN/WAN to facilitate public IP circuit sales to end customers or intranet aggregation between multiple regional offices allowing communication between physical locations without logically going out to the public internet. 
 I&#x27;ve been reflexively using &quot;pseudowire&quot; when referring to SD-WAN type devices that do something similar with a standard public facing interface for public internet and a virtual/tunnel interface for intraoffice aggregation.
 When using this terminology with folks my age, they either understand what I mean or don&#x27;t speak up to say they don&#x27;t/ask for clarification/etc. However, recently had a conversation with some in their early 20&#x27;s who had no idea of what I was talking about. 
 Wondering if pseudowire is just a &quot;Oldman referring to Rust as BASIC&quot; or if the advent of SD-WAN as a VPN appliance has deprecated the usage of that term.

 We currently have an issue with our SAN storage, as the issue is that one of the SP&#x27;s is losing access to the volume. 
 Currently we have two switches setup for redundancy within our environment, and one EMC connecting to the two fibre switches as mentioned. The EMC is having difficulties connecting to our switches across one of the SP&#x27;s connected. 
 We have SP-A and SP-B, both of these are exact replicas of each other, using the same fibre cabling and SFP&#x27;s, they are both configured the same to each other. However we are having issues with connections of SP-A. We are continually seeing the below error across SP-A. 
 &quot;Lost access to volume 638f3632-e929b695-29a2-b49691e7e836 (VM Store 01) due to connectivity issues. Recovery attempt is in progress and outcome will be reported shortly.

 We are using Dell EMC and IBM switches - Dell EMC is hosting 3 EXSi hosts which all have difficulties with SP-A, however with SP-B they connect correctly

 My own example. Static routes on the firewall pointing out the wrong interface. But the traffic going back out to vendor is egressing the correct interface anyways, because… I don’t know, firewall magic?

                              <span>I have been learning about DHCP snooping lately and recently I came up with 2 different notions while learning how to prevent DHCP Exhaustion. It&#x27;s the CHADDR and source mac address. So, when clients&#x27; messages are received on untrusted ports, it checks if the CHADDR field and source mac address fields are same, if yes, forward, if not, deny. I came up only with this answer on https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/question/0D53i00000Kt7NhCAJ/dhcp-snooping-source-mac-address-vs-client-hardware-address but, didn&#x27;t seem to understand profoundly. Could you, please, explain in a basic way the difference? Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Lets see we have two hosts, same VLAN. Host A initiates a ping to host B. Host A sends its ARP request, and host B answers. At that point, does host B also do its own ARP request before sending its ICMP reply? Or does it populate its ARP table based on the original ARP request from host A?
 I feel this is a simple question but im struggling to find a definitive answer.
 Thanks

                              <span>Consumer grade m2 SSDs from name brands are pretty reliable. If the drives are in RAID 1 or higher and you have email alerts about drive failures and 3/2/1 backups, it seems like it would be a perfectly viable server storage solution for small and medium sized businesses, along with super high performance.
 If you buy on a sale, you can get an m2 2TB or 4TB for $100 and $250 respectively, whereas Dell charges over $1000 per 2TB SATA SSD.
 Has anyone here had a good experience installing MS Server to an array on an m2 raid card? If so, can you recommend any specific cards?

                              <span>So, random one for ya’ll…
 We have a user with 3 PC’s, we use MS Authenticator for MFA/SSO.
 The feedback I’m hearing is that on one PC the user will check to not ask again for 30 days… then they’ll be in another location on PC 2 and attempt to access an app behind SSO and get promoted for MFA, they’ll say don’t ask again for 30 days…. Then further on PC 3… same thing.
 To confirm, this is the behavior we would expect, right?! The “don’t ask again for 30 days” is specific to the device that they made that action on… 
 Does anyone know a way to “sync” multiple devices to respect the MFA prompt? 
 I appreciate the feedback.

 On top of this, lots of people have Shared Mailboxes and I believe this might be adding to the overall size and causing some freezing/access issues. 
 What solutions do you use for archiving old emails?
 how does it work for people accessing only through the cloud?

                              <span>20 years in this game. Basically, all I&#x27;ve ever done. Got paid to defrag shit in the late 90s. Got paid to remove 11 IE toolbars in the early 2000s. Got paid to actually work as helpdesk in the late 2000s, into MSP world shortly after, and have essentially bounced back and forth between Fortune 500 and MSP. I&#x27;m in the trenches. I&#x27;ve called the vendors. Fought the contractors. Managed the managers. Blah... blah.
 ​
 I&#x27;ll probably get &quot;Fuck AT&amp;T&quot; etched on my headstone. I struggle to think of two words I&#x27;ve put together more frequently. 
 Consumer wireless/internet/TV? Check. Fuck &#x27;em. 
 Business DSL/UVerse/IPFlex/BVoIP? Check. Fuck &#x27;em.
 It&#x27;s not even necessarily the service. Or the price. Although both of those .... well, aren&#x27;t the best.
 It&#x27;s the support. I can&#x27;t think of a more frustrating thing to do than to call AT&amp;T because something is wrong. TODAY? 6 hours. Not done yet, either, but done for the day. I can&#x27;t count the departments, personnel, time zones, cultures, and frustrations that I encountered along the way. The first call is never the right call, nor the second, rarely the third, and your chances of success only creep upwards from there.
 Man... Fuck AT&amp;T.
 ​
 ​
 PS - if anybody got those good resources, whatever department, if you know a good number to get a specific thing done... maybe this rant turns into a saving grace. Maybe it&#x27;s just another rant on the internet. Yes, it&#x27;s short, far as rants go. I&#x27;m tired. I called AT&amp;T today.

                              <span>I am currently doing a lot of interviewing but am fully employed. However, recently quiet a lot of companies have taken interest in my resume and are reaching out. An issue I am conflicted about is, would it a bit awkward during an interview with a hiring manager to ask about if they see the role staying around? I know the economy is up in the air right now and I hear about layoffs, but not sure if that is a turn off for employers if you ask something about that. Since usually the first to enter are also the first to go when it comes to layoffs. 
 Just as a potential employee I would not want to get hired and then when the new year arrives get laid off.

 I am trying to move the VB6 app (just an exe) to a new server. However, the app fails to launch with no useful information.We do not have the source code for the app. 
 I have tried reviewing ProcMon to see what it&#x27;s trying to load, but have been unsuccessful in weeding through the many entries. I&#x27;ve also tried depends.exe to see if anything glaring stands out, but no luck.
 Are there any other tools that might help point me in the direction of what files/connections it is trying to call at launch?

 Like so many others here, myself and my co-workers are completely buried under an insurmountable pile of tickets and projects and we are just doing the best that we can. Well yesterday the holiday party started at 1:00 p.m. and lasted until the end of the day. I forced myself to grab food and not immediately go back to my desk and go back to pounding away on my keyboard even though that&#x27;s whatever fiber of my instinct was telling me to do. I was thinking that maybe with everybody preoccupied with the party, I could actually get some work done, but I&#x27;m trying to force myself to have a bet…</span>

                              <span>Sorry if this is common knowledge or posted about before, I just find it odd that the January update for Edge will be the last released to Server 2012 R2 when it&#x27;s still in support to October 2023. Especially with how hard MS are pushing to kill IE once and for all and have everyone move onto Edge, to have no support for Edge for 9 months while the OS is supported seems really bizarre.
 If this is a Chromium thing that&#x27;s out of MS&#x27;s hands, I&#x27;d have thought they&#x27;d have enough clout to delay any underlying changes so they&#x27;re not leaving this OS exposed like this?
 And yes, of course getting off 2012 R2 is the best option but not really the point of this.

I&#x27;m also a CS student, so not an IT professional.

At the same time, I&#x27;m not too familiar with corporate IT, so this may be normal but I just wanted to share since it seems like our company has negligent IT. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve found:
 Every employee has an employee email, which gives them access to the company&#x27;s SharePoint site.

 Got a Barracuda quote for $80k, an 890 and 3 years of support including cloud.
 I’m done with this. I think $26k year is nuts.
 If I want local backups with Veeam, what product and services do I need? I think a NAS RAID and 10GBe should easily handle local.
 If I want solid cloud backups, again; what products should I be looking at?

                              <span>Howdy all. Not sure if this is the right place to post this. I&#x27;ve been working as a senior helpdesk manager for 2 years now at an MSP. These past 6 months have been absolute torture. Our company fired 2 of our 4 techs in span of two months. Our client base has only gotten larger. Raises haven&#x27;t been handed out. Me and my single other coworkers workload has gotten enormous to the point where we can barely function. We have both expressed our concerns to the owners but they seem to fall on deaf ears. I guess my question is, does it ever get better? The Stress? The anger and frustration? Anyone have any suggestions on how they dcompress? This job has all but ruined technology for me. The main reason I originally went into IT was because I just love the satisfaction of fixing something that is broken, especially in tech. But that passion is gone. I know I haven&#x27;t been in the game that long so I don&#x27;t want to write off the industry as a whole, but I&#x27;m genuinely gonna lose it. 
 Sorry for the rant everyone!

 The main reason the client wanted a dock is so he can connect both monitors to the laptop so he can work normally. Now he has to work on single 15&quot; laptop screen because monitors via usb-c dock do not work. They used to work now they don&#x27;t. It just stopped working one day. Monitors are mostly used for excel documents this is a financial person and without dual monitors work is impossible. Both monitors are connected via display port cables that have been tested and work.
 Spend 2 hours remotely trying to fix the issue:
  
Updated firmware on dell dock to the latest
 
Updated all the drivers with HP support assistant
 
Updated windows 11 to latest build 22H2

                              <span>I have a customer (not on Office 365) that gets their messages sent to recipient&#x27;s junk folder ONLY IF it contains the URL to their website in the body. I have tested this every which way and the only time it gets sent to junk on the receiving end is:
  
The recipient is on Office 365
 The URL to their website is in the body.
  
The problem is even when you look at the Office 365 data it shows that DMARC and SPF passed AND that the URL in the body was not a threat.
 I have literally no data telling me why it was quarantined. We opened a ticket with Microsoft and it basically went nowhere. They wanted us to add it to the allow list in the account we were using for testing and they couldn&#x27;t comprehend the bigger picture that this is a problem for anyone on Office 365 that they send to.
 What can we do in this situation? Microsoft&#x27;s own portal says the URL is not a threat, we even checked the sending IP&#x27;s, the smart host IP&#x27;s and the website for blacklists (there were none). Has anyone been in this situation?

                              <span>I work for a city government and we have ~300 users and are gearing up to roll out MFA city wide (Office 365). I have contacted a few users of various technical proficiency to test out the instructions I have written up for them (a lot of older, computer-illiterate folks) and one thing I didn&#x27;t anticipate (although I should have) is that quite a few folks were hesitant to download the MS Authenticator app, with some even outright refusing. Not everyone has a smart phone issued to them so we are still offering the option to authenticate with SMS. It&#x27;s not ideal, but better than nothing. 
 Other than reiterating that the app does not collect personal information and does not open your personal device up for FOIA requests, is there anything I can tell people to give them peace of mind when we start migrating entire departments to MFA? I have spoken with department heads and our city manager about the potential for unrest over this, but is it just a case of telling people to suck it up and do it or you won&#x27;t have access to your account? I want to be as accommodating as possible (within reason) but I don&#x27;t want to stir the pot and have people think we are putting spyware on their personal phones.
 Anyone dealt with folks like this before?

                              <span>I wanted to gather some opinions on here. Have you migrated to Windows 11 yet? Pros and cons of doing so? I have been using it for quite a while now and I like it. However I am afraid of making the decision to move my org to it just yet. Users are usually against change of any kind, and even though I don&#x27;t think windows 11 is a big change, I wanted to see if others have made that decision and how was the feedback they got.

                              <span>I had a user account hacked in 365 yesterday. Didn&#x27;t know until I got an email that the user was blocked for spamming. From looking at the logs, I can see the login attempt from a remote location and a Authenticator MFA notification was approved. The user tells me that they didn&#x27;t receive or approve any notifications. I tend to believe them since we have the numbers matching and location based settings turned on for Authenticator and I would think they would remember typing in the numbers.
 The strange thing I noticed is that the audit logs show a change in authentication methods at the time of the login. An iPhone was mysteriously added as an authentication method on the account.
 Has anyone seen behavior like this before?
 Update: After reviewing logs it looks like credentials were phished then an MFA approval by the user. I don’t think their lying, they just didn’t even realize they were phished. This created a mess because the attacker sent out 100’s of emails from the account. Thanks for all the info and suggestions that have been mentioned.

 Unsolicited b2b spam (the &quot;I&#x27;m circling back at the risk of being a lingering annoyance&quot; messages) really, really frustrate me for a number of reasons, chief among them though:
  
dozens to hundreds a day; and,
 it pisses off employees if/when certain ones make it through routinely (think specific senders or domains) and then I have to hear about it.
  
My solution... every one of these messages I see entering our mail system, I add the sending domain (not the senders address) to an auto-reject list. If they have multiple domains associated with them that I can find, I block those, too.
 The other day I have this b2b rep contact me because they&#x27;ve discovered my game (+1 for your tenacity in actually figuring out what I&#x27;m actually doing, but I&#x27;m not unblocking your domain), and I get this ugly email about how I&#x27;m being unfair, depriving them of income opportunities, yadda, yadda, yadda. 
 So here&#x27;s the question ... am I actually being unfair? How in the world is anybody supposed to combat the sheer, unrelenting torrent of daily b2b spam? 
 If anybody else has a better or less predictable way of &quot;terminating&quot; these emails, I&#x27;m all ears.

 I use many services that realize authentication via LDAP, in the course of the thought to eventually aim for LDAPS authentication I was wondering if authentication against the Active Directory for accessing a Windows machine that is a member of the domain is encrypted out of the box or does it need to have a PKI server too?

 3. Verify return code: 21 (unable to verify the first certificate)
 Where do i have to put the Intermediate and Root certificates for Windows to deliver them when a LDAPs request occurs?
 I have build a certificate chain like i would with our Exchange certificate but that did not work either. When imported via step one, the chain is split up in the console and the issuers certificate is listed separate.
 Picture for clarification: Certificate Snap-in
 ​
 Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>Howdy Folks,
 I&#x27;m trying to install .Net Framework 4.8.4115.0 via sccm as (install - required) it failed with error general 16389 &quot;Past due - will be retired&quot;. When digging deep to read &quot;dd_ndp48-x86-x64-allos-enu_decompression_log.txt&quot; in Windows\Temp folder, I found this below, which is very strange for me :(
 But if you make it available, and press install, It&#x27;ll work.
 and I must install it silently without bothering 250 users to do by them self. 
 Detection method are both (Install &amp; Version) under (HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\NET Framework Setup\NDP\v4\Full)
 Could you assist me , please?

 What is your daily keyboard driver?
 I understand that some don&#x27;t, but what&#x27;s the problem about it? To me it&#x27;s like a mechanical clock.
 Watching a colleague get frustrated by the noise coming from another desk and I don&#x27;t mind it one bit. Like people genuinely dislike the clicky clicky? Tactile feedback is where it&#x27;s at. As a sysadmin I would love to have one myself in the office.
 I do like old mechanical typewriters (Smith Corona) as well - something like this https://www.amazon.com/Qwerkywriter-Typewriter-Inspired-Mechanical-Wireless/dp/B01KM6EJOY
 Or a decent IBM model M

 If a user in domain A wants to sign into machine A1 with their domain B credentials, will this work if A1 cannot talk to a DC in domain B? Will the request go to domain controller A and then be authenticated against B from there?

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 I&#x27;m getting the two windows errors 10048 and 10055 on Windows 10 after a short while of runtime indicating that the listening address is already in use or no more sockets are available.
 ​
 I tried the following solution found on the Net: Increasing MaxUserPort under: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
 But that doesn&#x27;t help.
 ​
 Also listing the opened Ports via netstat -a -b or tcpview.exe and trying to kill suspicious processes does not help. I have killed dozens of processes, but nothing helps and I failed to identify a bad process.
 Also there are not too many open listening sockets less than 50 maybe, so there is no way that the number of allowed sockets is maxed out. But still the system won&#x27;t allow me to listen to any new socket, or any random port claiming that the address or socket is already in use or no buffer space is available to open any new connections.
 ​
 Only thing that helps is to restart the system and wait for the problem to occur again, which can happen within an hour or maybe work several hours for the error to occur.
 ​
 I&#x27;m out of ideas. The system was running fine for months and now this problem is bugging me since a few weeks without finding a solution that avoids a restart.
 Anyone has experience with these errors and has any suggestions beyond what I have already tried and mentioned above?
 The system is an I7 11th gen with 64GB of RAM running updated Windows 10.
 Thanks for the Help!

                              <span>I’ve got an on-prem domain controller that sinks with Azure AD. My boss who has rights in AD, created a user locally, who actually previously worked for our district. so what I’m thinking happened is his local AD account was deleted originally after he left, but his O365 account remained. 
 When he created the local AD account, it created a new user and never synced with the original account? The root of the issue is we use the Company Name field for a dynamic group in Azure for email. 
 However, this users company name is different in AD then it is in Azure (from his previous role). His email and everything loads with no issues with his previous inbox. I thought of using power show and the Set-AzureADUserExtension cmdlet, but it won’t allow me because it’s originated on an on-prem AD. 
 Any ideas?

                              <span>Sorry, I&#x27;m new to this sysadmin job and I have a question:
 I just received 15 new laptops to replace employee&#x27;s old laptops today. Do you just tell them to set up everything themselves from scratch (after i pxe-boot them), or do you copy over user settings/programs etc from the old computer? What do you use to copy over old programs/settings?

                              <span>I&#x27;m working as an IT intern and here we use a really archaic system of backup powered by a HP machine (we use HP data protector manager software to manage it), i&#x27;m learning a lot here but i&#x27;m having to figure out a thing and is driving me crazy. The backup system just stopped working last week because some of the data tapes are listeed as &quot;write protected&quot; on the software. At first i thought it was the fisical lock that the data tapes have was on but it wasn&#x27;t, can&#x27;t figure out what is going on. If there is some information missing i will edit the post with it later.

 TL;DR: Albania is looking to put five government tech workers in jail for up to 7 years because they failed to implement a fix to block a Sharepoint vulnerability. 14 months after the patch was released, Iranian hackers entered their systems and ran amok.

                              <span>Hey sysadmins, 
 I have been tasked with the great opportunity to destroy the data on 720 HDDs. I know. It&#x27;s really cool ...
 I need to figure out a way to do it fast and secure. 
 In the past I have been using DBAN, but I need to figure out a solution to do batches of 10 or even more HDDs at once. 
 Any ideas what hardware is needed to achieve something like that? 
 The HDDs need to be reused, so it&#x27;s just destroying the data on the drives that&#x27;s needed and not the drive itself. 
 ​
 Any suggestions or experience with such a task is welcome.
 ​
 Thank you!

                              <span>I&#x27;m exploring different solutions for application patching on Windows endpoints (around 300 right now, different locations). My aim being:
 * Easy to deploy and manage * Unattended, low maintenance * 100% cloud based * Cover already installed software, not only new deployments * Focus on low priority apps, like 7zip or web browsers. Business critical software is managed via Intune, will stay this way.
 PDQ Deploy and alike won&#x27;t really work due to cloud requirement. I also don&#x27;t want to rely on Intune for every app, updating it manually. I don&#x27;t have the manpower at the moment. This is a one man department with MSP support. I need this to be smart and automated, while keeping it inhouse within my control. Something I can setup and let it do the work, like with Lenovo Commercial Vantage for firmware and driver updates on our fleet of devices.
 I&#x27;m looking into winget right now, specifically this spin on it: Winget AutoUpdate - WAU and I really like it so far, testing in the lab. Of course I know it won&#x27;t cover 100% of my inventory, but it works really well for what it is. About to launch small pilot with 10 users.
 I&#x27;d love to hear about your experiences, some success stories (if any!). Have you tried similar approaches, be it Winget or Chocolatey? Do you maintain your own repos, deploy software this way?

Additionally, we intend to grow next year by 3-5 employees.
 I have already set up emails with our custom domains and activated MFA.However, I am no system admin and therefore I need to know what other settings with that license should be adjusted from a security/privacy point of view.
 The admin console is quite overwhelming and I am interested in your insights on what I should tackle urgently.

 nevertheless, I know that the functionality I need is not expensive, there is computer-software on github that does this for free. there is also special drivers for normal network cards that do this.
 This is however not a solution for me bevause network on my work laptop is restricted.

                              <span>We have successfully implemented (for the most part it seems) SPF, DKIM and DMARC to help with the spoofing of our domain but it seems that we are still receiving some spoofed mail despite the DMARC policy being set to quarantine.
 I had a look at the mail headers and believe this is due to our mail going out to a signature server, applying a signature and returning before being sent to its intended destination. This is set up in O365 via connectors and has an appropriate SPF record in our DNS.
 Could this be giving a false positive and passing on DMARC? In the header details, Authentication-Results comes back as a spf&#x3D;pass, dkim&#x3D;none, dmarc&#x3D;pass but this is with the IP of our signature server so that is good because we want that to pass. Whereas Authentication-Results-Original returns a failure: spf&#x3D;fail, dkim&#x3D;none, dmarc&#x3D;fail.
 Has anyone experienced this before and do you have any advice in how to combat this? Given that Authentication-Results-Original gives the result I would expect is the signature server causing this issue?

                              <span>Collecting digital evidence for the court my company is faced with an unscrupulous team of developers, the contractor wants to assign one of the modules as intellectual property. But the contract states that All intellectual property rights directly or indirectly used by the Contractor are and must remain the property of the Customer. The source code is with the developer, but the binary file is on our server (how to say correctly?) how and what evidence can I collect as evidence for court. Is there a snapshot i may take from the server or other specifically related evidence to that app from other sources.

                              <span>So in about a month our current endpoint solution&#x27;s(kaspersky) contract ends, and we are looking around for a new solution, preferably cloud based with no internal server needed.
 I was wondering what other people&#x27;s experiences were with the current Anti Virus solutions? if it was just up to us(at the IT) we would just depend on the tools we have now in defender and such, but thats not going to be good enough with 90 to 100 teachers walking around.
 ​
 some small tidbits of info
 - we currently have about 180 endpoint clients running
 - we are only paying 8 $ per user per year with Kaspersky, which is dirt cheap.
 - we are currently using a google workspace environment but we are planning on migrating to a microsoft azure environment
 - we are located in Europe. I dont think that matters much but I have read some different experiences between certain solutions between regions.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m still new with all the SAML/SSO stuff.
 We have an app that connects to an IdP. The IdP requires the SP Metadata to have an entity ID in URI. Everything works well with this setup. I can see in the AuthnRequest that the Issuer is in URI.
 Now, we&#x27;ve been trying to put AWS Cognito or Auth0 between the web app and the IdP.
 The problem is, the IdP that we&#x27;re using requires the Entity ID to be URI.
 In AWS Cognito/Auth0, Entity ID is in URN format. 
 I wonder if Cognito/Auth0 is not supported by the IdP. Also, what&#x27;s the difference between IdP&#x27;s that require URI and URN for the Entity ID?
 Thank you!

Tried using regedit in GPO and a task scheduler that imports an AppAssociations.xml during login proces. None of it has worked and wondering if any of you has done something like this by not using computer configuration.

 For example, if you where planning on updating a customers server to the latest sql service pack, where would you even start to calculate a outage/update window. 
 Side note, there is no such thing as out of hours for this company as they are 24/7 so I can&#x27;t just do it out of hours and let it take as long as it needs over the night.

                              <span>I’ve recently been involved in fitting out a new building with 400 desks and took the leap to using Dell USB-C monitors and daisy chaining display port to a second Dell monitor. We also use Dell Latitude laptops. Initially everything was working great except the cracks began to show quickly. 
 Because the second monitor is daisy chained Windows doesn’t know about it immediately when returning from sleep or hibernate. This means that any windows that were open before sleeping will all move back to the primary monitor. 
 Intermittently when docking, one of the monitors will be blurry. Changing resolution to anything else then changing back to 1080p fixes it. 
 Worst of all, randomly when returning from sleep and logging in, the whole laptop will reboot. We’ve been unable to figure this out and Dell are stumped too. 
 All up this has been a major reputation hit and we’re now having to go back to buying docks and having to mess around with re-cabling all these desks. On paper they were perfect but in practice not so much.

 Been in IT for 32 years and I’ve never come across this before (been lucky I guess). I’ve been troubleshooting an app supported by another section in my Department off and on for months with no luck and I’ve come to the conclusion that except for the app’s support team lead, the 3 or 4 app support people are Administrative paper pushing IT and not technical IT. Yet they attempt to help me with my “Why won’t your client app connect to your back-end when I try to install it?” question. Documentation is spotty, from the early 2010’s, contains grammatical errors written by someone for whom English is a 2nd language and is in no way helpful. 
 So 2 or 3 troubleshooting sessions in, they call in the team lead. I’m a team lead for my team so we are e…</span>

 I work at a small MSP and my boss wants me to put something in place to stop ex-employees accessing company resources. For example our Mailchimp account, [support@company.com](mailto:support@company.com) with a randomly-generated password. An employee leaves and we want to make sure they can&#x27;t get into this account. Simple enough, change the password.
 What do I do when there&#x27;s Mailchimp, Unifi, Namecheap, VMware, Cisco, 300 of these accounts? Changing all of these passwords individually when an employee moves on is obviously an option but there has to be a smarter way. For a bigger company with thousands of employees this would be a full time job. How do the big players handle this?

                              <span>I don&#x27;t honestly care how fast/slow it is, I need to buy a few for my team for testing, and validating solutions. It just needs it to support RADIUS based user auth with EAP-TTLS/PAP, MSCHAPv2, AND EAP-TLS certificate-based user auth.
 I was looking at Ubiquiti AC-PRO&#x27;s, they&#x27;re cheap enough used, and Unifi controller software is pretty decent, I wish I could manually choose protocols though. Was wondering if anyone knew specifically of a sub $50 used (can be older and slow, bandwidth is literally unimportant) WAP, maybe Aerohive, Cisco, Aruba, netgear pro, Engenius, etc. that might work?

 I left Zyxel off the list, as i can&#x27;t stand their interface and methodology, after configuring a dozen of those things I would like to not have to touch one ever again.
 Thanks in advance if anyone has any recommendations!

                              <span>Basically title. I’m in charge of migrating our older nexus 3k’s to a newer pair of Nexus 3k’s. They’re running vPC with a handful of port channels. 
 Obviously the configs will essentially be a copy/paste and what not, but how would you guys/gals go about cutting them over with the least amount of impact? 
 Since we’re utilizing vPC, could i just get vPC up and running on my new 3k’s and then cut over each port channel one link at a time? 
 Just wanted to get some thoughts/advice. 
 Much appreciated!

 A strange thing happened and I&#x27;m currently working with PA support to troubleshoot this: a VPN tunnel establishes when the Peer IP (set as static) doesn&#x27;t match but the local and peer identifier matches. The PSK matches. 
 Is this a normal occurrence or a bug in PAN OS?

                              <span>Hey Everyone!
 Some Background:
 Around 6 months ago, I went from being a Level II Service Desk Analyst to an IT Manager for a small business aerospace company (less than 50 employees). Won&#x27;t lie to you, no clue how I got the job, guess they liked my soft skills. Applied cause the company name was cool, I&#x27;m deep in it now and I&#x27;m ready to gain some crazy experience.
 This was a brand new position as they are trying to move away from MSP IT to Internal IT. As of right now, I am the IT Department.
 The first few months I was understanding the layout of their network and understanding their immediate needs. I&#x27;ve finally gotten their top priority needs out of the way and now I can work on the nitty gritty.

                              <span>Hello all, I have an issue that has been a complete PITA to troubleshoot and resolve.
 Infrastructure backstory:
 Core device is a fiber aggregation switch stack (2x Cisco C3850-12XS) that all MDF and IDFs connect to over LACP port channels (Fiber Sw 1  M/IDF Sw 1, Fiber Sw 2  M/IDF Sw 2).
 Wireless is handled by cloud management, no on-prem controller.
 Issue:
 Generally excessive amount of %SW_MATM-4-MACFLAP_NOTIF logs popping up in the fiber switch. Switch 2 interface for Port-Channel 5 and 6 have repeated state changes and appears to be related. The state change doesn&#x27;t happen at the same time and is not consistent but does happen almost daily. Also, only the fiber switch side&#x27;s interface is having this state change.
 Troubleshooting:
 Both fiber switches have been rebooted.
 Swapped the SFP modules from Sw 1 to Sw 2 and vice versa. State change issue remained on Sw 2.
 Only thing I haven&#x27;t done yet was to move the SFP modules to completely new ports as this is remote site and I&#x27;m waiting on an onsite visit to get that accomplished.
 I am aware of the &quot;why&quot; this is happening, insofar as the MAC flaps caused by the end users roaming between APs that are on different switches, so it sees the MAC twice. What I&#x27;m perplexed on is why it&#x27;s causing a couple interfaces to constantly drop. The drop is not causing noticeable issues and doesn&#x27;t bring down the port-channel, just constantly state changing.

                              <span>I have some Catalyst 4510R+E switches for the taking. Will I regret my life choices if I use them as L2/L3 switches?
 Yes, I know they are EoL. Yes, I know the ports are oversubscribed. I&#x27;m fine even with the 6 Gbps per slot bandwidth of classic modules. Yes, I know they are power hogs.
 That being said, if I load a switch up with 384 SFP ports, it looks like it will only use about 1 KW of power. That isn&#x27;t totally unreasonable. It&#x27;s less than 3 W per port.
 Feel free to check my math:
  
redundant supervisors and chassis 554 W
 
8 x WS-X4448-GB-SFP @ 65 W each totalling 520 W
 
 Grand total 1074 W / 384 ports &#x3D; 2,8 W per port
 So, what do y&#x27;all say? Yay or nay?

                              <span>I&#x27;m having a strange issue with 2 devices - both with a static IP - not seeing each other when connected via a dumb switch.
 One device is a laptop, the other is a specialist device addressed with a dip switch. When each are connected directly to each other, they work fine. Can ping etc.
 When connected with anything in the middle (router, dumb switch with only those 2 devices) there&#x27;s nothing. No settings changed etc. 
  
Cable works, been swapped and not the issue. 
 Switch works and is not the issue.
 Used a smart switch and gives no decent data. Although not sure what to look for.
 Previously worked
 No settings have been changed
  
If anyone has any ideas on what&#x27;s going on, it&#x27;d be appreciated!

 I am a network engineer for a company that is in the process of transitioning from a cisco infrastructure to a Junos one. at the moment we are running fiber from our cisco suite to our Junos one... on the Junos side they decided to use AE channels.. is this normal? is there a better way? i would think a trunk along on the fiber would be the best way but it is currently set up the way you see below:
 ​
 {master:0}
 root@FCCLT-102-MDF-VC1&gt; show interfaces ae1.0
 Logical interface ae1.0 (Index 594) (SNMP ifIndex 576)

 im wondering if on juniper this is the best method for bandwidth across the two suites.. we are getting terrible connectivity issues in the new suite with about 300 clients. 10gig fiber is ran from suite to suite.

 thanks for reading!

 I&#x27;m looking for a network switch that is at maximum 6&quot; deep and can be rack mounted. I don&#x27;t need a lot of ports, 12 would be lots. I&#x27;m dealing with an old install where the patch panel is mounted to a 6&quot; deep 4U wall mount. I&#x27;m having problems finding anything like this. Most of them are the full depth switches.
 Thanks for the help.

                              <span>This is a rule 6 / educational post (request).
 I live in Israel.
 Despite the country&#x27;s reputation as being relatively advanced in technology, fiber optic has only begun getting rolled out here - on a largescale basis - over the past few years. 
 An awful lot of the rest of the network is still connected through vDSL and coaxial.
 I&#x27;ve been trying to make sense of how the various ISPs / infrastructure owners have been laying fiber in my city. 
 It took the best part of two years to finally become available at my building. And when it finally did, it seemed as if every fiber network (there are, I believe, at least 3) was hooked up.
 I know that the internet backbone is built on fiber and that the other inferior forms of connectivity are really used only for last mile stuff to bring internet to consumers.
 I guess what I&#x27;m curious to know is what kind of factors make it difficult and time consuming to go from getting fiber from a junction box to the point of being able to finally connect a building and then dwelling units.
 Liaising with other infrastructure providers? Waiting for permits from municipalities to dig up roads to lay cable? Lots of difficult splicing work that has to be carried out in the field?
 How does it happen, exactly, and why does it seem to be a long and cumbersome process?

 What about their course?
 I have Richard Stevens - TCP/IP Illustraied Volume 1
 But, damn that material so outdated and with Networking Basics i&#x27;ll have free access to PT, exercises, fresh material and so on... Can i replace Stevens with Cisco free course?
 Thanks : )

                              <span>OpenVPN is single threaded. Running multiple OpenVPN processes and assigning a public IP address to each one of them is a waste.
 I come from BSD world where solution to the problem is rather simple. Socket flag SO_REUSEPORT_LB allows multiple OpenVPN processes to connect to a single socket that performs UDP load balancing.
 Linux only comes with SO_REUSEPORT (without LB part). I had tried to think of a way to run multiple OpenVPN processes and came up with this
  
UDP proxy on a host (ha-proxy/nginx)
 OpenVPN processes in a container behind UDP proxy
 Each container peers with the host and announces its tun* interface (BGP, OSPF whatever. Or even a bunch of static routes on the host)
  
Looks like a lot of overhead. So how do you Linux guys scale OpenVPN?

 I&#x60;ve been doing this lab trying to figure out how to get through BGP EVPN l2vpn between IOS XE and IOS XR. Here&#x60;s the topology.
 ​
 ISR4431 PE ROUTER - ISR4451 P ROUTER - NCS540 PE ROUTER
 ​
 IGP being used is IS-IS, and segment routing is enabled. I have no problem doing bgp evpn l2vpn if its IOS XE to IOS XE, it works well, however in this case I need to get through it from an IOS XE device and IOS XR. I can see the mac of the ce1 and ce2 being advertise in the bridge-domain, however it wont ping between the vlan. Here is the config.
 ​
 ISR4431 - IOS XE l2vpn evpn instance 520 vlan-based bridge-domain 520 member GigabitEthernet0/0/0 service-instance 520 member evpn-instance 520 ! interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0 no ip address negotiation auto service instance 520 ethernet encapsul…</span>

 My PC is using the dyanmic IP, provided by my ISP. Which automatically changes from time to time.
 The Second PC need to use my PC as a Middelman, so that it can use my Public IP to access the Internet
 Both PC will be using windows. Tried NO-ip, But got confused around the port forwarding stuff.
 Please Help with Some guide , Software&#x27;s which can help me do this.
 Things required to make this work?
 This is What I need

                              <span>Are there any businesses out there strictly using web proxies for content inspection and ssl decryption. I’m curious as to what proxies are in use as I have a few businesses that need the decryption but are thinking that it might be more cost effective to go with a proxy as opposed to using a NGFW - currently running ASAs but looking to make the leap.
 I remember Bluecoat back in the day but don’t think they are as popular as they once were.

                              <span>Hear me out, I know I should learn what&#x27;s needed and what suits me best. However, my aim is to work in Singapore or any other English-speaking countries since that&#x27;s the only language I can use beside my mother tongue and I don&#x27;t intend to learn a new language. 
 I want to know if Ansible would be a bonus when working in Foreign countries. I know it&#x27;s pretty popular for DevOps and SysAdmins. But I will probably be working in SIs as a network engineer since it&#x27;s fun for me, so I&#x27;d love to maintain, monitor, and/or configure all the sites/projects that I have, so if Ansible isn&#x27;t thought of as a bonus for a Network Engineer in foreign countries, I&#x27;d just dedicate my time making a project with nornir or something else that really suits my needs

 Anyone have any good recommendations?

                              <span>Can someone please help me understand what would be the difference on the two options below from production impact perspective?
 Say I have a three-router full mesh OSPF network and all of them are inter connected with 10Gbps links . On R1, I wanted to steer traffic towards to R2 and only failover to R3 by manipulating the OSPF cost. I could use the bandwidth command under the transit interfaces to make R1-R3 interfaces have lower bandwidth OR use the ip ospf cost command under the transit interfaces to make R1-R3 path cost higher. But which one would introduce the least production impact? I believe either would cause OSPF to re-calculate and flood the routing table, right?

                              <span>I’m in desperate need to upgrade a P2P circuit from 1G to 10G. I reached out to my AT&amp;T team but I’m impatient and wanted to ask you all about what device would AT&amp;T provide 10G handoff on? In my telco room AT&amp;T operates a Ciena 5140 that trunks to Ciena 3930 switches for a few of our existing circuits. At this point all those circuits are currently 1G but I’ve read that the Ciena does have two 10G SFP ports. Would they be able to provide a 10G SMF handoff with these current 3930 devices?

 Cisco has released some new information about how they are going to be revising the certification more often now. Does anyone know if the CCNP renewal process has changed? 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m totally green when it comes to networking. I went to a site yesterday where they had changed ISP&#x27;s from Comcast to Ziply Fiber. The Ziply folks installed the demarc box, ran a cable to a RAD ETX-2i-10G and then left without making any other connections. 
 The people at the site had no idea how any of it worked and had no idea where the Comcast cable was coming in their building. I&#x27;m pretty sure I traced it to where Comcast comes in the building and goes into a fiber patch panel. 
 Am I able to just unsplice? the Comcast cable out of the patch panel and splice the new Ziply wire in? Or will they have to get a new patch panel to keep their current setup?

                              <span>I have a three node k3s cluster setup on some basic compute. These are plugged into a L2 switch, with an uplink to a pfsense router.
 I&#x27;m using MetalLB on the k3s cluster for BGP, and FRR service installed on the pfsense router. BGP is working fine, and my BFD profiles are quickly detecting failures. 
 The problem is with ECMP, I was expecting equal load balancing of traffic across all three nodes (with pfsense distributing the traffic with FRR). However, it looks likes its only choosing one &quot;best&quot; route even though it says the other two are multipath...
 ​
 Am I understanding ECMP correctly, or maybe FRR doesn&#x27;t support round-robin ECMP? But if it doesn&#x27;t, what&#x27;s the purpose of any ECMP support?

 Or if I had two intermediate CA&#x27;s could the root or first intermediate be OCSP responders for certs signed by the lowest intermediate?

                              <span>Hi all,
 tl;dr: How do you provide internet to multiple locations and have it tie into your main network?
 I want to preface by saying that I have very little networking experience. However, the facility I work for no longer has a network administrator so I&#x27;m trying to learn some more of how it&#x27;s setup. 
 Currently, there is one main location, and several satellite locations. From what I understand, the network comes in to the main building, and at some point is literally beamed over to 4 other locations. This is accomplished via emitters and receivers by Ubiquiti. As I&#x27;ve just found out, when one of those receivers goes down, Ubiquiti offers no support to help troubleshoot, or replace if needed. And replacing one involves climbing a long ladder with another ladder to reach the point that the receiver is on, mounting the equipment to the roof at a specific angle, and pointing it at the emitter at a precise point to receive the internet connection. All things that sound really specialized. 
 In any case, previously I worked at a school district. There were 19 locations, and no Ubiquiti or something similar wireless emitters in sight. 
 My question is, is something like this usually done by getting separate Internet connections configured, one for each building, and tying them into the main network? One of the Ubiquiti receivers is several miles away (so I&#x27;ve been told), I&#x27;m actually shocked it works at all. It seems like a really odd way to take care of something that seems mostly self explanatory... but I don&#x27;t really know what I&#x27;m talking about.

 To elaborate: For the past week now, maybe a little more, Google thinks my organization&#x27;s IP range is in France, and not the US. After some testing we came to the conclusion that the problem is with Google.
  
Browsing to Google.com with any browser (we tried several), from within the company network: location shows as France
 Browsing to Google maps automatically opens France
 Location sharing in the browser is disabled company wide - browsers not sending location data
 Tried both Google and Bing; Bing has the right location
 We have our own ASN
 ARIN registration is current and correct
 Searched multiple publicly available geolocation DBs - all show the correct location for our IP range
  
Any advice would be appreciated!
 Or any clue on how to get a hold of the right people at Google. That seems nearly impossible!

                              <span>Hi!
 Can the Cisco switches be configured to automatically backup their configuration when a change is saved? Or periodically? Otherwise, what is the best way to save the configuration manually? I&#x27;m thinking in case I need to replace a failed unit. So then I would need to restore startup-config and the VLAN config. Anything else? Are there any gotchas or other things to consider?

 I am new to this sub and found about the Meraki Go lineup last week. I am wondering if I can just buy the Meraki Go APs and get all the benefits of VLAN setup, Mesh network without buying the switch and router? I already have an unmanaged switch to connect all the APs.

                              <span>My client just acquired a neighbor&#x27;s warehouse space. The building is adjacent to my client&#x27;s existing company. But new office employees will be sitting at the farthest point, maybe 150M (edited after measuring) meters from the existing office and server room. The new space has its networking room and wiring. The owner wants new employees to connect to the main server room.
 The existing office has 100 employees.
 The new space will have 60 employees. ( these users will be using our network share - lots of engineering drawings, etc. )
 How should I connect these two server rooms?
 I am no expert in long-distance cable networking.
 I appreciate it if you have any ideas/questions/concerns.
 Their existing subnet is 255.255.252.0
 What kind of switch and cables should I use? Cat6, Cat7, or Fiber?
 I am thinking of putting https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YWJT5CZ/ref&#x3D;ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;th&#x3D;1 with unifi switch.

My reseller has recommended the Fortigate 200F to replace our Cisco routers AND our Cisco 5525X firewalls. The 200F with enterprise bundle is cheaper than just a Cisco 8300 router...this seems too good to be true. Anybody got insight on moving from Cisco to Fortinet? A little background on our location we run a vmware datacenter with roughly 150 servers, and a call center with up to 200 users. Our network is currently 100% Cisco: routers, ngfw, nexus data switch pair, catalyst switching stacks, Meraki wifi.

                              <span>Hello everyone, Maybe this is a strange question: I have a firepower 7115 with inline pair in and out between two non Cisco firewalls which are running carp interfaces. I have checked the connection events on the FMC but can’t see the multicast carp traffic(heartbeat). When I make a capture on the firepower I can see the traffic passing through the box as expected. (Source IP Interface of master -&gt; DestIp 224.0.018) Can someone explain why this traffic isn’t logged by the firepower ?

                              <span>So I&#x27;m not sure if anyone else can give me a hand. I&#x27;ve started implementing MFA/radius auth across all my switches.
 The 2920&#x27;s and others it works fine.
 I get to the 5406 and it&#x27;s not. I&#x27;m half wondering if the source ip isn&#x27;t what I think it is. 
 As the 5406 is a core switch, I don&#x27;t know where the traffic is coming from.. (I would think that it would come from the IP I manage it from) but the commands primary-vlan and others mentioned in older docs don&#x27;t exist anymore. I&#x27;m running KB.16.03.0006 
 radius-server host x.x.x.x key &quot;******&quot;
 radius-server timeout 15
 radius-server retransmit 2
 aaa authentication login privilege-mode 
 aaa authentication ssh enable radius local
 aaa authentication web enable radius loca
 ​
 At the moment I&#x27;m using this, the 5406 has a dozen IP&#x27;s it could use to do authentications, the radius server requires I specify the IP the radius auth requests are coming from.. (fortinet&#x27;s fortiauthenticator)
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>Company I work for has been using UniFi products over the past few years (wouldn&#x27;t be my choice...but alas...) but the throughput for L2TP VPN on the UDM Pro/SE is straight garbage after a recent update. The most excruciating part was there are individual VPN&#x27;s for each network since they had the budget for physically separating each network (UDM for each LAN). I wasn&#x27;t a fan of that setup anyways, so I&#x27;ve installed an EdgeRouter 4 and configured OpenVPN on it to avoid using basic authentication and opt for certificate based authentication. The design I have in mind is that this EdgeRouter will have access to each of our 3 LANs and allow OpenVPN clients (such as myself) to manage these networks without having to connect to a different VPN each time.

                              <span>Dear community,
 I&#x27;m in the process of setting up an Azure VPN Gateway S2S connection (route-based IKEv2).
 For best throughput, Microsoft recommends to use GCMAES256 for both IPsec encryption and IPsec Integrity.
 Another supported option would be to use AES256 for IPsec encryption and SHA256 for IPsec integrity.
 I am wondering if there would be any security implications.
 Summarized, these are the configurations that I am considering for the IKEv2:
 configuration 1: GCMAES256:
  
 IKE Phase 1:   
  
 Encryption Integrity/PRF DH Group 
  AES256 SHA384 ECP384 (&#x3D;DHGroup 20) 
  IKE Phase 2(IPsec):   
  IPsec Encryption IPsec Integrity PFS Group 
  GCMAES256 GCMAES256 ECP384 (&#x3D;DHGroup 20) 
 
 ​
 configuration 2: AES256+SHA256:
  
 IKE Phase 1   
  
 Encryption Integrity/PRF DH Group 
  AES256 SHA384 ECP384 (&#x3D;DHGroup 20) 
  IKE Phase 2(IPsec):   
  IPsec Encryption IPsec Integrity PFS Group 
  AES256 SHA256 ECP384 (&#x3D;DHGroup 20) 
 
 ​
 Since throughput will be better using GCMAES256 for both IPsec encryption and IPsec Integrity, I want to use configuration 1.
 Would there be any reason to prefer configuration 2 over configuration 1 from a security point-of-view ?

                              <span>I have 2 firewalls running HA but have a single copper handoff from the ISP.
 I currently bring the copper handoff from the ISP to a VLAN on a switch in my environment, and from there back out to each firewall.
 What does everyone consider &#x27;best practice&#x27; from a security standpoint?
 Would it be better to add a &#x27;dirty switch&#x27; outside of the environment in between the ISP and the firewall(s)? Or is this just another failure point?
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hey guys
 Tbh, not sure if this is a Windows or Networking question .. but here goes.
 TL;DR - Is it normal for a DHCP server to show ~150 Request/Ack entries for a given PC for a given day?
 .
 On my workplace I&#x27;m investigating some logs from a specific PC, where I need to crossreference the timestamps with the DHCP server&#x27;s communication with said PC.
 The PC was on-prem on the day in question, talking directly with the company DHCP server (although there might have been a firewall in between the LAN networks).
 When I ask my colleague to pull the DHCP logs (from Logpoint) for one 24-hour period, I get somewhere close to 150 DHCP entries in the log, with a ca. 50/50 distribution of DHCPREQUEST and DHCPACK (status: RENEW).
 The initial DORA process on the PC&#x27;s boot looks fine - it&#x27;s all the entries after that which puzzle me. The PC retains the same IP address all day.
 Lease time is 4 hours, I&#x27;m told (can&#x27;t confirm on my own PC, working from home right now).
 .
 My first thought is that the user closes the lid many times during the day, and the PC will negotiate a renew on the lease when it wakes again. However, my colleagues insist that the PC should retain its IP when going to sleep (not hibernate). My Google skills fall short when trying to confirm this.
 But even if the PC renegotiates every time - it would mean that the user closes their lid every 10 minutes or so during an entire day, and opens it immediately afterwards. This seems extremely unlikely.
 I&#x27;ve asked the DHCP guys at work about this, but they&#x27;re out of office these days, so I&#x27;m trying here meanwhile.
 Does anyone have an input as to why the Logpoint logs show ~150 DHCP entries for a single PC during one work day (assuming normal user behaviour)?

                              <span>What do people use to plan and test their network before configuring it? I have looked in to GNS3, however it says for best performance it should be installed on a VM. 
 Are there any other alternatives that you would recommend?

                              <span>Does anyone know why Aruba SFP+ modules are more expensive than ones coded for other brands, including other HPE/H3C SFPs? Aruba J9150D compatible SFP is $26 while Dell or Cisco is $20. The gap is even larger for single mode J9151D. I was once told there were extra parts in the HPE-Procurve /Aruba ones, but I’ve never heard why or what they actually do. Or if that is even true.

                              <span>Hi guys. Our offices are connected via IPsec tunnels but there is one specific tunnel that drops relatively frequently. The tunnel connects our US and China offices. Trouble is, I&#x27;ve never been able to explain why. To get it back I usually have to failover to our backup ISP in the US office (and fail back to the primary again) and it will come back up.
 There are other occasions when the tunnel from China to our other offices (also in Asia) fails so the common theme is China. What&#x27;s the likely reason? Could it just be the great FW in China having an impact? We use Check Point firewalls - happy to learn something new!

                              <span>Hello!
 I work for an employer with a number of different sites. The organization&#x27;s main office is moving from one location with multiple one-story buildings to a seven-story office building over the next year or two. Until now, our scheme for data has mostly followed 10.111.X.Y, with X being an arbitrary VLAN ID associated with a specific department and Y being the host. VoIP has typically mirrored that but with a VLAN ID equal to X + 100 (i.e. VLAN 50&#x27;s voice VLAN is 150), and wireless has been a single VLAN across the entire organization. 
 At our new building, we are tentatively planning on sticking with 10.111.X.Y, but with X being an arbitrary VLAN associated with the floor, not the department. The idea is to hopefully simplify management on our end since there will be multiple departments per floor but only one switch stack. We&#x27;re planning on the same voice VLAN scheme. We&#x27;re undecided on whether to do a single wireless subnet or one per floor. We&#x27;re also considering adding another VLAN schema (like X + 200) for various maintenance devices on each floor of the new building, like cameras, HVAC equipment, etc.
 Does this all make sense? Is there a more efficient way of doing this? What&#x27;s worked in your experience? We don&#x27;t have too large a number of end users or devices, but we figure if there was ever a time to adjust our addressing it would be now. As a side note, what is standard practice for VPN pools? Right now we are using a completely random range (10.100.20.x). Would it make more sense to use something in the 10.111.x range? Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

 I worked for an MSP for two years and it soured my experience so much that I&#x27;m leaving the industry entirely and started doing app development. I tried to write up a post about my experience a few times now, but it always devolved into a short novel so I&#x27;ll just focus on one incident and maybe post more later when I can collect my thoughts better. 
 A strange lady walked into the office one day. She was wearing a mask and sunglasses so you barely see any of her face. Apparently, she was on the phone with our operation director before coming into the office. After greeting her, …</span>

If interested he directed me to reach out to their Hiring Manager, to which I did. The Hiring Manager emailed me back and stated &quot;The job briefing and interview is conducted via email and you are required to pay attention, read carefully and respond as fast as you can to keep the conversation smooth. &quot;
 I&#x27;ve never interviewed with a company that way. Is that normal? Seems very odd to me, and hard for him to even get to know me. Anybody else been through a similar situation?

                              <span>When you get audited, what are your deadlines depending on severity? For example, critical &#x3D; 1 week, high &#x3D; 2 weeks, medium &#x3D; 1 month, low &#x3D; 2 months, informational &#x3D; 3 months. This is obviously a guideline. There are some things that need 1 day remediation, while there are others that, while high severity are complex and require more time. 
 Any input is appreciated!

                              <span>Hello,
 I have been in the technology field for about a decade so not really long I guess. I started in the help desk and I am now a sys admin. I do not do any hiring. In my experience, when I work with a new employee (in the IT dept) and I see them doing the ol chicken pecker method to type out an email, I just feel like I am going to be in for a long day. Maybe its the few people I have worked with. I&#x27;ve seen people at my last job hire someone with &quot;years of experience&quot; just to find out they cant use the home keys. Next thing you know I have to explain a process to them several times. training new people is exhaustive.
 I have been using a mouse / keyboard since I was a kid so I don&#x27;t expect everyone to be a fast typer but I feel like there is a correlation between keyboard familiarity and knowing your shit.
 Have any of you seen someone break this stigma that I have in my head? are there people out there in senior management positions that actually know what they are talking about and are chicken peckers? or new employees you got in? 
 Edit: a lot of people are taking this personally. I am not saying that I have an HR problem with a slow typer. or I wouldnt give them a chance. I wanted to see if anyone else that has seen someone be bad with a mouse / keyboard but be good as a technician.

 Not so sure where to go with this statement. The software vendor was just in here thinking he’s giving us some sort of sick burn for being idiots.
 There is no magnetic imaging here either to be clear. Turns out they’re using a driver made for vista that hasn’t been touched since, they don’t have/offer a new one. Problem located.

                              <span>We (the server/sysadmin team) have been managing SCCM for about 5 years. We use it for reporting, Windows client updates (monthly), some application installs, and other various means. 
 Recently, our Systems Architect has decided the help desk needs to manage Windows updates for the clients, his reasoning? They are workstations, the server team is not responsible for them. Ok, from a high level perspective, I agree. However, the system used to manage those updates is our responsibility. 
 He is really pushing this on the help desk, so I&#x27;ve decided him and I need to have a meeting about this. 
 I find several issues with this line he is trying to draw:
 •The help desk does not currently manage nor know how to use SCCM (I understand this does not mean it isn&#x27;t their responsibility)
 •The sysadmin team has been managing SCCM for 5 years (this doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s our responsibility)
 •None of our roles define SCCM as a responsibility
 Typically, a Desktop Engineer role would buffer this, but we don&#x27;t have that role.
 So who is responsible? Managing clients is a gray area, some responsibility falls on us, some on the help desk. This all started when I pulled the data on our ~800+ clients running 1909, critically out of date. He said the help desk should have known and been on top of it, and here we are. 
 I have found little to no help desk roles in the industry where SCCM is a requirement, quite the opposite for sysadmin roles. 
 I look forward to and appreciate all your input.
 Edit: Lots of good points about this being an opportunity for the HD folks to grow. The problem is, they don&#x27;t want to grow, or learn SCCM, or apply for our open sysadmin role. 
 I hope this provides some clarification on that front.

 We use a scheduling software that allows to send emails from their system, and any email sent out, or replied to will all be stored in a communication log for the related event using a specific sort of gibberish email address generated for each of them. 
 We’ve recently had issues where clients are not receiving emails, or emails are being blocked by bounces. At first I thought maybe their email server was just having issues but I think I found something that might tell me why. After several requests they finally advised the bounce code was 550 - which to my understanding means the server blocked the message based on a spam filter. 
 I looked up their DNS records, and their A and MX record show…</span>

 I&#x27;m just out of the yearly evaluation with two partners, the CFO and head of HR.
 They are so happy with my work I had a 5k bonus (last year in my previous job I had a 50$ gift card...) and a 400$ monthly raise. When they asked me if there was anything I&#x27;d like to change with the job / workplace, I couldn&#x27;t think of anything. People are nice, the job is interresting, I learn every day, they want to keep me and put effort into it.

I can&#x27;t find the settings on this model. I have looked at tons of Ricoh manuals to no avail. Does anyone out there have an idea of where they might be?

                              <span>I’ve got one office who’s having an odd issue with outlook. A couple times a month they’ll have an email get auto moved to a sub folder. But none of them have ever used any rules. When it effects one user in that office it effects all of them. Happens with both internal and external emails. New threads and replies. Different subfolders. Seems to be completely random, but does always seem to move it to the “correct” folder. I haven’t gotten these types of reports from any other office. 
 Has anyone else seen similar behavior? We’re running a hybrid environment with on-prem mailboxes and O365 client.

If so, would you say the older write ups still stand or has SAP changes enough in that time to justify digging through the processes and making new usage parameters to monitor with?

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I am fairly new to IT. I am about to finish a 4 year degree (IT) and I have been working the helpdesk / light network admin work for the past year. I also have a few certs, Net+ and AWS CCP. 
 So I can’t say that I haven’t learned anything- I have learned a LOT. But I feel like learning actual in-demand skills at a high level, as well as actually retaining that information, is difficult.
 Recently, I’ve started taking my learning more seriously. Instead of just reading a book or watching a video, I actually break them down and document what I am learning in Notion. But I feel like the things that I am learning aren’t sticking like they do for some of the other senior guys on forums like this.
 How do you guys go about learning and actually retaining the information you learn? I’ve even had the thought that what I am doing now is right, because I am learning how to learn, aka getting better at learning new technologies, which I think is a foundational skill in IT.
 TLDR; How do you learn and retain knowledge specific to IT?

                              <span>Hello Everyone,
 as you know, the cost of printing from color printers is very high compared to black and white print out.
 How do you control this situation in the company you work for?
 If not everyone is authorized to print color, how do you determine this authorization? Who approves who can print in color?

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 Has anyone had any experience with dealing with a mixed environment that are using both M$ Auth App for some users where others are either still using SMS or alternative methods and looking to roll out the Number Matching/Geo Notification functionality within Azure AD Portal?
 Just wondering if when flipping the Auth method policy on to &quot;All Users&quot; if it&#x27;ll cause any headaches with the previously setup alternative methods for authentication (such as SMS/etc), or only with those that may be using the M$ Auth App will that impact.
 We have been piloting it here since preview with a few of our staff, it works great. Its just trying now to figure out how to turn this on and then begin full migration over to it from those that are using the less secure methods (SIM Swap/etc). 
 TIA!

Can anyone suggest where I can get an image that I can reload onto a new CF card? (I have tried the support pages of Spectracom&#x27;s new owners, Orolia, but to no avail) Any clues, please?

                              <span>Hello,
 Other posts with comments where some say never to install it on a DC, some say its fine/doesnt matter as long as you configure it correctly. And documentation says install it on a mgmt computer and then the GPO extension says to typically where you edit GPOs which would be on a DC.
 I want to use LAPS only for clients. And setting the GPO to apply only on clients OU.
 Installing LAPS MGMT tool on a DC shouldnt be any problems right? As long as I dont set the LAPS settings GPO to apply for the DC.
 Thanks!

                              <span>My opinion is that it&#x27;s really not that great.
 Often times the translations are jsut ridicolous, you better know if they like \ or / to seperate directories (there are generally no examples or guidance given near or above fields), you have to tick a box to enter a host-name instead of an ip adress (i guess a regex check was too hard for them to code), there is no search option despite the massive number of settings and submenus and it&#x27;s just on the slow side, i could go on...
 Am I just stupid? How do you feel about Konica Minolta&#x27;s web interface?
 What are your favourite printers that &quot;just work&quot; and need no guesswork on what to enter 
 Have a nice day all!

                              <span>This seems like an oddly niche circumstance but I&#x27;ve seen this several times in my career and it&#x27;s happened again today. 
 So there was a dude who was the architect for one of our environments, probably built it all and did most of the BAU work on it as far as i can tell for several years.
 This guy has now gone to another job somewhere in security in the same business and handed over BAU support to us. This environment is ancient, all running on EoL hardware, out of support operating systems, lights up like a Christmas tree on pen-test reports that we&#x27;ve been trying to address for six months now...although at this stage it would be easier to just turn the whole lot off, politically that&#x27;s not really possible. 
 Out of all the business guess who is most up our arse about fixing the absolute fuck load of problems with this environment? Yep, the guy that has looked after it for twelve fucking years and addressed absolutely none of the problems.
 I&#x27;ve never wanted to punch someone through a monitor so much in my career.

 I got on that site some L3 Switches from Netgear - M5300, 2 on prem HP servers with NIC teaming.
 My plan is to have 2x LAN for Workplace.
 Which cables should I take ? Cat 7 or Cat 8 ? Should I be aware of something ? 
 Thanks for any ideas and tips.

 I&#x27;m just trying to put the change request together and I realise that I&#x27;ve never had one of these go wrong before.
 My question is: In what ways does this process fail, how badly can it break the schema and what does the recovery look like?

 We use AzureAD, and Manage Engine Endpoint Central as our MDM. I&#x27;m trying to put in conditional access policies or control access from certain devices. Is there a guide on getting Endpoint Central to set the compliance status of devices within AzureAD? 
 I can find guides on some other compliance partners but it doesnt say anything about Endpoint Central.

                              <span>Boss told me to &quot;take the day off to contemplate&quot; after some poor interactions between the two of us. I&#x27;ll be honest that part of it is on me: in the past year, I&#x27;ve lost a brother, been hospitalized twice, had my wife hospitalized, father with a quad-bypass, mother very recently with a stint replacement, and a minor family member we&#x27;ve had to coach through some life-altering nonsense that I&#x27;d rather not repeat. So, yeah, I&#x27;ve been a little out-of-pocket this year, and that&#x27;s on me. 
 I got this guy not only his job, but his position, then he did an end-run around me with an outgoing C-level exec to get team lead, and due to a manpower shortage at the time, fell into management. I was honestly okay with all of that, because I knew the guy was A-list material; I wouldn&#x27;t have gone to bat for him otherwise. Also, fuck management... in 25 years of this, I&#x27;ve never wanted to be one, so more power to those who do. 
 So, here I am... trying my best to be cordial with a guy who has from day one of having access to payroll been upset that I make more than him, while he&#x27;s talking to me like the goddamned godfather, filling a position I had the opportunity to leave at least five times, now trying to get out-from-under before I get fired or PIP&#x27;d into a corner, all while trying not to be the asshole who fracks off without leaving documentation. 
 Sigh... I was honestly hoping to be able to retire at this one. Ten years with an employer is a pretty good stint, in my book. 
 Mods: Feel free to delete this without animosity. Just needed it off my chest.

                              <span>I’ve been tasked with coming up with new ways to promote / test security awareness at my company. I was gonna do a USB drop test but our security policies will just block these.
 Anyone got any fun or unique ideas?

 ​
 I recently started with a MSP last year, similar time to another chap, younger than I. I&#x27;m 30M and he&#x27;s 20M. 
 We&#x27;re a small team, of 6, 1 director, 1 manager and the rest of us are boots on the ground, IT Support. 
 ​
 Since I&#x27;ve started, the 20yr sits Infront of me and I&#x27;ve been forced to complain about the 20yr guy, (I hate complaining so the fact I did this was a big deal for me) the reasons I complained were this:
 ​
  
He&#x27;s always on his phone and does the bare minimum to get by
 He for some unknown reason says my name numerous times throughout the day for no reason at all and sometimes starts singing and includes my name. 
 As he sits infront of me, he will lift his two fingers up and wave them towards me and on occasion if he&#x27;s waking past he will do it very c…</span>

                              <span>In the last week, there&#x27;s been 4 major attacks affecting certain social agencies and NGO&#x27;s, i&#x27;ve been curiosly following these stories and one culprit that keeps popping up is &#x27;MFA Fatigue&#x27; , in an attempt to secure our infrastructure or reduce chances of falling prey to some of these attacks, i&#x27;ve been implementing a handful of measures/policies, most of which i actually learnt from here through various posts and responses.
 In the wake of this, i have a few questions or concerns that i&#x27;m hoping to get some feedback on how you all handle this in your organizations.
  
how do you deal with MFA fatigue? by preventing MFA from prompting via push notification but rather require the user open the App and fill in the code? this way if you aren&#x27;t logging in anywhere, you won&#x27;t have the need to open the app?
 how do you also handle Atypical travel? blocking IP or setting strict account lockout threshold?
 is SSPR adviceable? or does it grant an attacker an added option to gain full control?
  
I already did research most this via google and Microsoft learn...so as the attackers. i was just wondering if there are any other methods apart from the obvious of dealing with these attacks.
 ​
 thanks.

 I want to force MFA on RDP connections, but everything i can find relates to RDP gateway config. 
 I could set this up, but wouldnt a user in the office just be able to RDP straight over and bypass the gateway?
 edit: or can that be prevented in some way?

                              <span>Morning
 I&#x27;ve been a bit of an idiot and i didnt realize that Windows 10 had version 22H2. I assumed that was Windows 11 and onwards. My site of around 300 machines are all running 21H2 so from my understanding i can upgrade via the enablement package. 21H2 have support until the middle of next year so no immediate rush.
 I want to push this out to a few machines to test, i use WSUS and client side targetting so applying this to individual machines can be a pain as i would have to setup a new GPO to target a new client side group.
 I was wondering if its possible to get hold of the files and push it out via PDQ instead? I notice it says they are not available from the Windows Update catalogue though.
 Has anyone else used the enablement package outside of WSUS some how and managed to upgrade machines?
 Appreciate any advice

                              <span>Good morning/ day/ evening, good Sirs!
 Quite a few months ago (Or maybe even last year), we had a case of Conficker on one of our client&#x27;s DCs. Back then, I thought I completely removed the thing, since it was coming from an old XP machine, made it&#x27;s way to the DC and didn&#x27;t really do anything else, since it was so effing old. I used ZenMap, to, supposedly, find all remains and remove them, but now I&#x27;ve gotten a notice, that the disk-space for C:\ is getting low. I checked to find Sophos Endpoint Agent creating snapshot files by the hour, because it kept finding and deleting the same file in Sys32, that is being generated by some mysterious Conficker Virus remains. 
 I checked online, but didn&#x27;t get any real results, just some general tips, on how to remove Conficker. Now, I&#x27;m not really experienced, when it comes to malware and viruses, so I don&#x27;t know, where to start, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m turning to your expertise again. If you need more info, please go ahead and ask, and I&#x27;ll provide any necessary info.
 Cheers!

 currently RAID 6 Degraded with 2 Disk failed. We changed two times (Two spare kicked in rebuild starts auto ), but the rebuild failed after some hours. 
 The RAID has two Controllers , one is not working and a another spare Controller did not work.
 The data can still be access, but I have no ideas what to do.
 What I have read in forums and articles is not good 
 Some have an Idea?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in a few different positions at some level of Sysadmin/Systems Engineer for the past 10 years or so, have a 4 year degree in IT. I have worked in an array of different industries, most notably finance, manufacturing, and media.
 My previous position had me in DevOps engineering where I was able to master Kubernetes, Helm, CI/CD, and Infrastructure-as-code best practices. Unfortunately due to various reasons I reached that &quot;burn-out&quot; point where I was underpaid and overwhelmed with the work being requested of me, so I found a new position earlier this year, working in media.
 A few months in, the transition between the two environments has been, well.. extreme.
 Pros: Finally getting paid what I&#x27;m worth, in an industry more to my liking, with less responsibility!
 Cons: Mostly Windows environment (few hundred servers, mostly bare-metal), no documentation aside from a handful of spreadsheets, inconsistent communication within the department, no one&#x27;s even heard of a code repository before, management is very resistant to change. 
 I&#x27;m someone who&#x27;s done all the DevOps things and enjoys doing them when the workloads are reasonable. This is the path I want to grow in as (from what I can tell) the world is moving more towards microservice/IaaS models. 
 Am I in the right for wanting to gracefully push the place more towards modern standards? or should I just accept that this is the culture in the new industry and maybe this position isn&#x27;t a good fit after all?

                              <span>Hi-
 I have a set of GS meraki go switches and GR wireless APs on which I’m trying to configure VLANs for GUEST network. I have a Firewalla which i set up in router mode but it doesn’t seem like i can configure VLANs on my Meraki GO equipment without a GX router. Is that correct?

                              <span>Hi all,
 Network Engineer for Municipal ISP. We currently have a /23 and /22 from ARIN. I&#x27;m planning for when we need more addresses. There are several options and I&#x27;d like to ask your opinion to see what your experiences have been.
 We could go down the road of CGNAT. Very expensive and we are a small shop with no experience with this technology.
 NAT6to4 seems easy enough to configure, but I worry about to scalability and robustness.
 We also have the option to lease additional /20 IP space for ~ 0.20c and IP per year with a 5 year term. Cheap, but not a long term solution.
 Then there is the option of getting IPv6 space form ARIN and using IPv6 exclusively. Without complete internet adoption of IPv6 I worry about routing and reachability issues to organizations that aren&#x27;t at least dual stacked.
 What are your thoughts?

                              <span>Maybe this is an obvious answer, maybe it’s not; but what was the first stratum 1 clock set to?
 I get that we’ve got very accurate clocks that can detect the passing of microseconds based on radioactive decay, but how was the first one given an active time and then set to run??

                              <span>Hi we have one later 3 switch with 2 vlans, 2 SVI for those vlans with ip pim sparse mode command under it. One access switch hanging of that later 3 switch with same vlans and igmp snooping enabled. 
 Do i need to anything to enable inter vlan multicast? I believe because the layer 3 interfaces are on same switch i don&#x27;t even need RP . 
 I can see igm querer on both switches for both vlans.
 Please correct me if I&#x27;m missing something.

                              <span>I have an HP L3 switch connected to a Cisco L3 switch and am in the process of migrating SVIs. They are connected via 2x10G links in an LACP port-channel. This trunk carries a number of VLANs. There are devices hanging off of the Cisco switch with the HP core still handling the routing, and that all works fine.
 I created a test VLAN on each switch and added it to the trunk on both ends, with the intention of testing the SVI on the Cisco switch and only L2 on the HP side. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s coincidence that this is happening with the test VLAN, but I can&#x27;t get the test VLAN to pass any traffic across the trunk. Devices connected to the Cisco switch can talk to the SVI, but anything on the other side of the trunk can&#x27;t connect. I&#x27;ve done variations of testing and essentially, any devices on that test VLAN can talk to each other unless they are physically located on the other side of the trunk. I&#x27;ve moved the SVI to the HP side and anything on HP side is now able to talk to the SVI and anything on Cisco can no longer talk to it.
 If I run a packet capture on a device from either side, it sends ARPs and gets no replies, furthering my suspicion that this is just a L2 trunk issue.
 I suspect there is some sort of bug with this VLAN not getting passed because I added it later than other VLANs. I plan to shut and no shut the port on the Cisco switch during a window. I have encountered something similar when using VTP in the past.
 Just wondering if I&#x27;m missing something - this seems fairly basic so I&#x27;m astounded it&#x27;s causing such an issue.
 EDIT: No VTP in use. The Cisco switch is a pair of stacked 9500s, and the trunk port is cross-chassis etherchannel.

I&#x27;m wondering if there is a way to connect to the bootflash by removing it and connecting it to a computer. My thought was a USB to eUSB cable but not seeing much in the way of online offerings. Would this even be possible?

                              <span>I am trying to design a network for a tether to a vehicle. The original plan was to have a tether cable with two single mode fiber cables and have the cables running in full-duplex which is something I have done before. The network is very simple as in the image.
 The problem now is that due to supply issues is that we can only source a tether with a single fiber single mode. I have not set up a network like this before. Is it possible to still set up the same design using half-duplex mode. I have the following questions:
  
What type of media converter do I need to look for? The one I was going to use was https://www.mpl.ch/t2875.html since it needs to be small to fit the vehicle. But I am guessing the 100Base-FX or 1000Base-X are not compatible with half-duplex.
 What type of transceiver/connector would be best to use since I can no longer just use the LC Duplex connector?
 Are there any special considerations for the router/switch that I need to use to support half-duplex the original plan was to use a tiny unmanaged switch. But not I am not so sure that is possible https://botblox.io/products/gigablox-small-gigabit-switch
  
Is my idea still possible or do I need to abandon it now?
 Thanks

 I see them sometimes and curious what they exactly mean?
 I assume the idle timeout means after 30 min if no activity is occuring on the vpn that it deletes the tunnel?

 I might have kind of a &quot;silly&quot; question.
 I run three routers connected to my core router within area 0 - everything works perfect. 
 Do I need to create stub areas for my local attached networks where no additional router is being used or can/should be regular networks where PCs, laptops and so on are located ignored?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve noticed while building out some ansible automation that some of the modules take a very long time to complete runs. The main issue here is that it is slowing down the control plane and affecting some SNMP alerting. The main culprit here is the &quot;no shut&quot; command or rather enabling/disabling ports. 
 I&#x27;ve tried using the ansible module only for enabling ports, as a shutdown command is visible in the configuration and does not run. Templates for the rest of the configurations.
 I&#x27;ve tried using a template to speed up runs, which does help a bit, but still requires applying no shutdown to all ports in a switch stack. This takes a significant amount of time.
 ​
 Has anyone run into this type of problem with automating switch configurations? Should I look at another feature within ansible or perhaps use a separate tool to manage port status (maybe pulling facts? Or using napalm? Direct API commands?) ? I haven&#x27;t seen anything that will allow the no shutdown command to be present in the configuration, but it would be a nice to have feature.

I&#x27;m thinking of something that I could fairly safely put on the internet that could perform some very basic test like: your computer can reach the VPN portal! Your latency is &quot;GOOD&quot;. Your speed is &quot;BAD&quot;.
 Also - does anyone set (and enforce) minimum standards for internet connectivity for remote users?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m working with a company with several small branch offices. They have older Junipers that work as their gateway/firewall/edge router and VPN gateway. I&#x27;m trying to swap out these all-in-one appliances slowly, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like any new VPNs want to connect to the older Junipers. Any advice? It&#x27;s a hub-and-spoke setup.
 I&#x27;m thinking that the best way to proceed is to start in their central office by connecting a new appliance to the old, passing it a single public IP (1to1) at first, then slowly moving over other IPs, the branch VPNs, and services as time and budget permits. Eventually, the new appliance would be doing all the work. At that point, remove the old appliance and plug the new one directly into the ISP&#x27;s modem. 
 Is there a more common way to work through this scenario? Are there any gotchas? The project is not a rush and I assume it&#x27;ll take a couple of months to complete. If we were just talking about a few offices, I&#x27;d get everything provisioned, take them down on a Friday evening, and be done by the following Monday, but there are just too many branches to coordinate that over a single weekend. Thoughts?

                              <span>I’m working with a new ISP based in the UK, we are v6 first where we can. I have hit a block on CPEs. 
 Our main requirements are that it supports 464XLAT (specifically CLAT), tr-069 and has WiFi 5 minimum. If they are mesh devices great. It’s not a disaster if they aren’t. 
 I’ve spoken to Draytek, they have confirmed to me that they don’t support and are not looking to support 464. We are currently using some TP-link mesh boxes for lab testing though they don’t support 464 either though they are being cagey with me in regards to their roadmap. 
 Budgets are a bit above my pay grade, this is just POC work at the moment. 
 I know that OpenWRT supports it. But that brings a host of issues that I’d rather not have to deal with in a prod environment. 
 TIA

                              <span>Hello Everybody
 As in the past there were some Topics about beeing or becomming a Network Architect, i have written some clarification.
 First of we need to differentiate between: architect, designer and engineer.
 Those three, lets call them Functions (NOT job descriptions!), have different tasks, responsibilities and so need different know how! Also they relate to each other and if you are a engineer, it is not to be said that you have not also overlapping with the other two - vise-versa. as an Example, a Designer can also be the engineer.
 To clarify:
 The architect is responsible for strategic decisions for the next 3-5 years. His taks involve in getting the requirements from the business stakeholders, helping in creating the IT strategy, helping to connect the network to other BU and…</span>

                              <span>So on our network we have a WSA. When people come into our building to use VPNs, we have to add their VPN urls to a bypass list. From my understanding, we do this because we currently don&#x27;t have any public certs, and it is temporary.
 My question though is about Cisco Anyconnect. Usually we add the url that the VPN connects to but yesterday I ran into an issue. The person who was trying to connect, their any connect box on their screen just had a name of the server they were connecting to, not an IP or url.
 What would be the best way then to find the IP or URL in this case? When we went to the any connect settings , they were all blank because he was not connected.
 Our way of getting it to work was his wife, who was working remotely and also on the same VPN, sent a screen shot of her settings and from there we were able to get the server IP.
 But I am just curious what would have been the best way to find the IP or URL? Is there a file I can look at on the users PC? Like I said, when we went to his any connect settings, they were all blank beacuse he was not connected.
 Thanks

                              <span>Switches always have a Mpps rating - from small ones to data center ones. Why don&#x27;t routers have it too? It should be pretty predictable, especially when ASICs are involved. When it comes to firewalls the answer seems obvious - it probably depends on what the firewall is configured to do (and it may do a lot).

                              <span>I have this lab that pushes out huge images, &gt; 200gb through Symantec ghost. The source is on the same vlan as the clients. It runs into issues: slow transfer rate (it takes 3+ hours to finish, sometimes it’ll fail when it’s almost done. My shift would be over before I find out that the image failed so troubleshooting is very tedious!
 Anyway, any imaging/switching experts can offer any advice? I think this is a job for multicast but I’m not too familiar. We use Aruba 6300 switches. The vlan they’re using has igmp snooping and pim-sparse configured. If there’s a quick and dirty fix I’ll take it! If there’s something in the ghost software I need to tweak I’m all for it! Anything to avoid using a clean switch and cabling everything to it (that’s their idea btw)

                              <span>I have 3 AD. One in cloud. Two on prem. Recently promoted the Cloud to become Primary holding all FSMO role.
 Initially all replication are doing well. 
 Recently start popping error of sysvol failed to replicate followed by AD changes not showing on PDC despite DFS, repadmin, dcdiag and dfsdiag not showing any error at all. 
 Currently clueless on what to do. 
 PDC is hosted on AWS. Built fron scratch on Server 2019.
 Member server are Server 2016 which u will call SDC1 &amp; SDC2
 Additional info.
 Sync between SDC1 and SDC2 are doing fine.
 Tried performing repadmin /syncall /AdeP and replicate from option in ADSS on PDC but still not showing latest changes (new computer object and user creation)
 UPDATE 1: If i perform repadmin /syncall on PDC it goes straight to syncall finished without showing the usual replication is in progress information.
 Update 2: will temporary put it as solved. As i realize its Inter-Site and not Intra-Site hence the default replication timing is 3 hours. But will keep a look out if problem still shows will do a ADFS restore.

 Anyone else have any other good options?

 The issue is that I cannot edit a field when using a lookup value. So basically the computer name is in a list as a lookup field and I need to edit the return date.
 Everytime I try and work the script it tells me the system object cannot be converted to the pnp-pipeline. I will edit and post the code tomorrow but I&#x27;m hoping this I&#x27;d enough to jog someone&#x27;s brain so I can try in the AM. Thank you.

 format looks the same including the signature and picture in the signature.
 I am trying to get the headers but still waiting. The spoofed email address was the using the actual domainname but with a S added to the domainname. the new domain name was registered yesterday about 2 hours after the original email arrived to end customer. somewhere over in Iceland registered on namecheap
 is there a way to figure out if this is happening on MS servers? has anyone run into this?
 is it a possible virus on end users system? we scanned senders computer with 2 different antivirus its clean. checkout firewall log files, it has antivirus, threat protection and web filtering. nothing found and no weird traffic
 TIA

                              <span>All this talk about how the November CU update was breaking domain authentication in environments where RC4 was explicitly disabled via group policy sent me down a rabbit hole.
 My environment wasn&#x27;t affected, but it made me curious about WHY so many have disabled RC4. TLDR; it&#x27;s less secure than AES256.
 Step 1) audit your domain controllers for RC4 in use. Just replace DC01 with the name of your domain controller. 0x17 events means RC4 is being used.
 Get-WinEvent -LogName &#x27;Security&#x27; -ComputerName &#x27;DC01&#x27; -FilterXPath &quot;*[System[EventID&#x3D;4769] and EventData[Data[@Name&#x3D;&#x27;TicketEncryptionType&#x27;]&#x3D;&#x27;0x17&#x27;]]&quot; 
 What this uncovered is that Azure AD Connect for hybrid environments was using RC4 (it creates a computer object called AZUREADASSOACC). I guess the reason for this was that until sometime in 2020 AES wasn&#x27;t supported?? So if you use Azure AD Connect, you might want to look into this to improve security.
 Anyway, this article nicely outlines the steps needed to get Azure AD Connect using AES https://azuregeek.io/en/secure-azure-ad-sso-and-disable-rc4-hmac/?q&#x3D;%2Fen%2Fsecure-azure-ad-sso-and-disable-rc4-hmac%2F
 After following these steps &amp; rolling over my Kerberos decryption keys I now see Azure AD SSO now using AES (0x12 in the event log)

                              <span>Just ran into WU failing to install some updates with 0x800f0922 error code.
 Googled it and these failures are fairly common, but the &quot;solutions&quot; are all over the place. The most common one is to disable secure boot in the BIOS. Another one from this thread is to enable AppReadiness service. Plus the regular assortment of &quot;sfc /scannow&quot; and &quot;dism /restorehealth&quot; voodoo, and all the way up to updating BIOS and what not.
 The PSA is this - all of this is nonsensical. 0x800f0922 is a generic error meaning &quot;the installer failed&quot;.
 To understand the cause you need to skim though %WinDir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log and find the first error that then triggers a cascade of failures culminating in 0x800f0922.
 In our case it was that ... drumroll ... %System32%\Macromed\Flash directory was missing. Created it, re-run updates - et voila - all updates went through.

 When trying to set up a Microsoft 365 sandbox domain myself I found some of the documentation out of date, so this is a quick guide to setting up a sandbox domain for Microsoft 365 development.
 Why would you want to do this?​
 I personally needed this for recording a screencast of the process to install Corso. While recording myself going through permission settings in M365, I didn’t want to unintentionally reveal PII for my team members or other sensitive data.
 Another reason to do this is if you’re looking to level up both your skills and want to experiment with being the admin in your own space rather than impacting other users on a production domain. It’s also a good step to experiment with owning your own identity.
 Finally, this might also be useful i…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve reached out to support about this a few times since May, but it&#x27;s gotten worse recently. Essentially, barracuda has an internal list of senders and IPs it marks as -1000 and does not apply filtering to normally. This is obviously a problem, but if this list was EXTREMELY well curated, it would probably be fine. However, it is not. It whitelists all salesforce IPs for example, even if it&#x27;s a newly set up gmail etc. There are a lot of ways to exploit this list that I&#x27;ve observed since reporting the issue and just two weeks ago we had something very malicious make it through. I am not going to list every single way in which this list is easily exploited, but if you dig into it on your side you will very quickly see how someone could easily take advantage of it just by knowing it&#x27;s there …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m just curious I was working with the security specialist and I believe I was very nice to him. I am not familiar with all the terminology, so I sometimes may use the wrong Jargon. The security specialist has a &quot;put me in my place&quot; kind of attitude. I just took it as a learning experience, but the attitude is not needed. I&#x27;m a grown man I make mistakes I don&#x27;t know everything..I am a dummy and trying to get the work done. Give me some kind of respect please ..I don&#x27;t talk to you that way. I know when I work with customers I do not give them that same attitude that I&#x27;m given within the IT group. We treat customers with respect why do we not extend that same courtesy with each other?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m upgrading an infrastructure from Exchange 2016 to 2019 and will be creating a new DAG and new file witness server. Currently its on a server 2016 VM, but this seems overkill and apparently for a 2019 cluster, you can use anything that supports SMB2. I was thinking of using ubuntu server, but is there an even lighter OS I could use? preferably some kind of lightweight NAS VM that supports SMB2.
 Thanks

We have had this happen on four different ones, but the fifth so far is stable. We have 99 sitting on a pallet. 
 It seems they are having a Direct X crash (see below)
 Eventlog shows:

 We are at our wits end on this. Tech support is no help and drivers are all up to date. Ideas?

                              <span>Hi there,
 For many months we have been trying like everyone else to strengthen the security of our infrastructure and one of the many, many points to improve is to no longer use the domain administrator (the default one).
 The necessary was done but I noticed that it was still used. After reading the events I found the origin of the problem: a SQL server. Every evening when performing the backup jobs, the following logs appear :
 https://i.postimg.cc/bNnmqtHH/sql.jpg
 I&#x27;ve checked everywhere (in jobs, in SQL Server service accounts) and I don&#x27;t see our domain admin populated.
 Any idea how to prevent it from being used ? I wonder if SQL Server was installed with this domain admin and if the problem can come from there.
 Thanks !

Before fully starting the project I&#x27;d like to have a rollback plan in place in case something decides to go wrong. I&#x27;ve poked around online but can&#x27;t seem to find anything decent relating to my situation. Most are articles I&#x27;ve found are hybrid Exchange rollbacksand I&#x27;m not sure they would apply to our situation. We are migrating from Exchange 2013 to 2019.

 Appreciate the feedback in advance!

 We need a texting platform for sending out cancellation alerts, but also for allowing members of our HR department to text with potential candidates without having to use cell phones. 
 Anyone have any systems they like, before I go hit G2?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 So, long story short, we had an ask from our company to take our external contractor AD Users and run Enable-RemoteMailbox on them. We quickly found out that was not what should have been done and they should have had the command, Enable-MailUser run on them as they are external contractors and we simply want to have them as AD Users that have an external email address that mail is resolved to.
 Okay, simple enough I thought. So, I went ahead and ran the following for each user that was affected:
 Disable-RemoteMailbox -Identity  -Confirm:$false
 Enable-MailUser -Identity  -ExternalEmailAddress 
 We also wanted their Email field in the General tab of AD to match their UPN, so after running the above commands, AND before AAD sync happened (unfortunately) we updated their Email field to match that of their UPN. When we run the Enable-MailUser is makes their Email property their external email address. Well, that appears to have messed up those users where now On-prem they are showing as MailUsers, but in 365 they are showing still as a UserMailbox for RecipientType.
 We are struggling to get this update on both ends. So far, I have tried taking one of the users and running Disable-MailUser, letting that sync over to 365 and then running Enable-MailUser again. No luck. I have tried having the user set up as a MailUser On-prem and then stop syncing them with 365. Once they are no longer synced, I then re-sync them, but again, no luck.
 What&#x27;s even stranger is we noticed that when we disable them On-prem as a MailUser, and then re-sync them, one property keeps getting written back it would seem from 365 to On-prem...
 Within the user&#x27;s proxyAddresses, one address shows up. The x500? I&#x27;m wondering if I am missing a step here or if something else needs to be updated for these users to finally sync up as a MailUser On-prem as well as in 365? Thanks everyone!

                              <span>We recently went from an on-prem Exchange server to Microsoft 365. We still have On-Prem AD using AAD Connect to sync with 365. PC&#x27;s are a mix of Windows 10/11, all installed with Office 365. Whenever we have a new user logon, the system tries to load Outlook 2016 and connect to our old Exchange server (FYI, this is no longer turned on) My question is how does Windows try and load the 2016 version of something that isn&#x27;t installed and what setting do I need to turn off to stop it trying to connect to old Exchange?
 All our DNS records are correct and pointing to 365. In the interim of swapping systems we had to have an Autodiscover GPO which is now deleted.
 Any help appreciated

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve inherited an AD with company.com as internal AD domain as well es external domain name. Right now the external records (e.g. www.company.com) are just placed inside the default &quot;company.com&quot; zone inside the AD DNS.
 Is there currently any Best Practise way to keep external records automatically up2date inside the AD zone?
 There might be some way to automate this with powershell (lookup external records and set internal records accordingly) but this feels a bit too hacky.
 Best case would be to tell AD to lookup the records on the external DNS if the internal DNS does not have any records. As far as I understand by default AD doesn&#x27;t forward those requests since only the internal DNS is authoritative for &quot;company.com&quot;?
 It&#x27;s probably not as simple as adding the external name server to &quot;Properties -&gt; Nameserver&quot; on the AD I guess?
 Is there any way around this problem or do you just have to live with manually maintaining those external records on the internal DNS?
 I&#x27;ve also seen you can do zone transfers from AD to a specific server. Could you instead do a zone transfer from external to internal? (Without it overwriting all the internal records)
 Thanks!

                              <span>Auditing Teams membership changes can help admins ensure that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive information. By regularly auditing membership changes, organizations can identify and address any potential security risks.
 Since Audit log search has limited customization, I have written a PowerShell script to track Teams membership changes with advanced capabilities.
 You can download the script from GitHub.
 Script Highlights:
  
The script uses modern authentication to retrieve audit logs.
 Exports all the teams’ membership changes
 The script has a filter to track private channel membership changes separately.
 It has a filter to monitor shared channel membership changes separately.
 Allows you to generate an audit report for a custom period.
 It can be executed with an MFA enabled account too.
 Exports report results to CSV file.
 Automatically installs the EXO V2 module (if not installed already) upon your confirmation.
 The script is scheduler-friendly. I.e., Credentials can be passed as a parameter instead of saved inside the script.
  
If you have any suggestion or additional requirements, I will update them in the next version.

                              <span>Hi guys, there are a few posts on the web regarding this question, but all of them are 5+ years old without any usable solution...
 To keep it short- We have Active Directory in our company, with 300+ machines, of which ~50 are laptops.
 We have bad practices in the company - most of the laptop users don&#x27;t bring laptops to the company (thus not connecting to the company LAN, not updating group policy, and some custom software) for long periods of time.
 The general idea is to FORCE them to bring laptops to the company once in a while (every 15-20 days) by automatically expiring their cached domain credentials after X days or X logins. Since M$ till this day doesn&#x27;t offer any option to achieve this, I am wondering if maybe somebody had a similar situation and if there maybe is some workaround to achieve this?
 We have VPN (Checkpoint), but also can&#x27;t force users to use it (also no option to keep it constantly connected- which by itself is also bad idea because there would be a lot of incoming traffic on servers).

                              <span>Sorry if this doesn&#x27;t belong here but hoping you guys can help me out. I want to use Win8.1 on an old PC, without patching it and it will even lose support at the start of next year. Now, I don&#x27;t have anything important on it and really isn&#x27;t a big deal whatever happens to the system, but I would like to know what even could happen. How does an unpatched system get infected if I&#x27;m just on the internet using an updated browser? Everywhere I read that missing security updates is a big no no, but I want to know how. If I used trusted updated software, don&#x27;t download and run anything shady, how does my system get infected then? Can my browser security just get bypasses or what?

                              <span>Hi everyone, A little bit of my background before the real question: I&#x27;ve been working for 3 years in my current company (&gt;500 employees located around the world) started as a jr. sysadm, and now, after a lot of work and study, my team is pushing me to become the &quot;Exchange guy&quot;. I&#x27;m really happy about this, considering that I fell in love with it. Recently, we had some internal &quot;problems&quot; with the cybersec team (which is not in the IT dept anymore), and the question of the day is &quot;who should do what?&quot; Now that a lot of stuff has been migrated in the Purview portal, I think it&#x27;s harder to identify who should have access to it and, in particular, define all the permissions. I think both the exchange admin and the security admin should have access to the portal, and it&#x27;s mandatory that both the part talks before making any changes. What do you think/how do you handle this in your company?

 Hi, looking for a little advice. I&#x27;m wondering on the best path to go down with this..
 I have a new client who is still running SBS 2011 (I know, I know..), thankfully Exchange has been decommissioned and they are on 365 for mail. So it&#x27;s basically just an old file server which needs to be replaced at some stage with something modern.
 However they still use the Remote Desktop facility built into SBS2011. They would like to keep this if possible or some new variation of it. Is it still supported in newer versions of Windows Server?
 Thanks for any advice

                              <span>Hello,
 Mostly we use windows ltsc. We had some windows 10 pro computers and after upgrading computers to 21h1, some computers started to have problem when outlook tries connect Exchange server (we use 2016). It shows disconnected.
 I saw a reddit topic and and question topic to microsoft with same problem. But there is no solution.
 Only fix 
  
close outlook
 disable other network adapters
 open again outlook (outlook connects)
 enable network adapters again
  
Is there anyone who faced this problem and found solution.
 Thanks.

 I used printer driver packger NX but it is not that good. 
 I modified the files of the driver but windows does not allow to install.

 Would putting second email provider on a subdomain (@mail2.corp.eu) cause any issues?
 Apologies if this isn&#x27;t the correct place to ask.
 Setting up email with the second provider is just a single MX record, but I don&#x27;t want to risk it possibly damaging the Exchange/Outlook 365 setup.

 I am currently trying to implement a MFA Solution for the company I work with. While Fido2 works just fine on a Desktop Enviroment to secure the M365 access it&#x27;s utterly useless when the User has to work on a Terminal Server, because the Server does (for whatever reason) not recognise the Key so the User can&#x27;t login into their M365 while working on the Terminal Server.
 And sadly mandating the Authenticator App on the private phone of an employee is not possible (legally), so I am looking for a solution that works on Terminal Servers to secure the M365 access.

                              <span>My environment either needs a local repo or just to proxy the apt packages. The main repo server will be the only one able to go out to the web, everything else has to point at it for their packages/updates.
 100% ubuntu environment with server and desktop
 I&#x27;ve played with aptly in the past but the process of having to do the mirrors/snapshots and publishing and everything can be a bit of a hassle to update the repos often. Not major gripe but it&#x27;s just something.
 Apt-cacher-ng as a proxy seems promising as well. Haven&#x27;t used it but pretty straight forward.
 Would it be better to just utilize the proxy instead of storing an entire mirror of all ubuntu repos locally? I feel it would be, since that would be a huge waste of space if we only use maybe 20% of the actual packages in the repo. Not going to waste time figuring out exactly what packages each system uses but if we utilize the proxy then it can cache what&#x27;s needed and other systems can just grab from there if it&#x27;s cached and cut down on network traffic going out.
 One main concern is being able to freeze the updates/packages so that we can update our test string, verify it works and then update the prod string with the same package versions and everything.
 Obvious workaround is just to take note of package version #s when we do the update to test string but while doable that would be annoying for some of the admins i&#x27;m sure and I want this as simple as possible.
 Is there a way to set apt-cacher-ng to have 2 cache directories?

I know the exam was changed recently for core 1 &amp; 2 and wanted to see what people had used in the past to help study. I have found many Udemy courses and books, but am not sure what will be the most beneficial. I use computers frequently, but do not have a degree or experience working in IT. Please share what you found to be the best informational pieces to help pass the exam! I am trying to get my foot in the door and am not sure what would be the best course to start with on this journey that continues to align with what is needed for A+. Thanks all!

                              <span>I am no longer satisfied with the hosting I used for MonitUp.com and I want to change it.
 ​
 MonitUp, measures the productivity of employees and freelancers with employee monitoring.
 ​
 They did a firewall update Sunday night and I noticed the problem Monday morning. It took them until Monday noon to resolve this, the website failed to work properly. This is unacceptable. Losing customers for a SaaS product :(
 Which hosting are you using? Who in the world does this job best? Uninterrupted service and fast support in case of a problem are important.
 I don&#x27;t believe in the &quot;best hostings of 2022&quot; articles, the best ones usually depend on how much you pay the company that wrote that article :)
 We live in a world of lies!

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month&#x27;s updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft&#x27;s Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft&#x27;s updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn&#x27;t work.
 Test, test, and test!

                              <span>I&#x27;m starting a new job, and basically I&#x27;d be the &quot;main&quot; networking guy. They expect me to get ramped up fairly quickly. This is a medium sized logistics/shipping business. They mainly have a small team of sys admins and helpdesk guys with no real networking guys. I&#x27;d be working with one other network guy who is more junior (guy just got his CCNA)
 Small offices and locations peppered around the US. Fortinet, Sonicwall, Meraki, Dell storage, Meraki/Fortinet wireless, with Microsoft Hyper V. Not too terribly complicated from what I can tell.
 They don&#x27;t have any monitoring AFAIK, so I&#x27;ll be helping them build out that infrastructure there.
 Given this context, what are some of your tips/questions to ask to acclimate yourself to a new environment? Any favorite documentation tools? Personal recommendations for log aggregation solutions?

                              <span>Hello. Would love thoughts/opinions on the best devices or type of devices or service. I have recently started at a small but growing enterprise. Company has 4 locations in the US and 3 in Asia. 3 locations have 200-300 users each and the rest are tiny. One of the larger sites hosts a single public facing application, accessed by our partners, nothing else is hosted publicly in the enterprise services (with the exception of client VPN). The rest have users mostly accessing Office 365, other SaaS applications and a smattering of internal applications. So far the long term goals of the company are:
  
To ideally consolidate all sites on a single platform - not a hard requirement if something else makes sense but right now it&#x27;s a hodge podge and current gear is up for renewal and/or end of life. Everything is basic firewalls right now, no NGFW/UTM/SWG etc.
 To implement a greater degree of filtering/inspection/prevention/reporting and to ultimately integrate with an EDR/XDR platform for better visibility.
 To ideally eliminate our MPLS in favor of an SD-WAN, with redundant ISP&#x27;s in each location
 To move all server workloads, including the single public facing app, to public cloud
  
The security vendor who my boss (CIO) has a relationship with is pushing him to buy their EDR/XDR platform along with their UTM&#x27;s in every location. This is running a pretty high price tag and causing him to think about whether he can afford two for every location to have redundancy/fail over. I have a good networking foundation but my background is more on the server and storage side. At this point I am thinking that these UTM&#x27;s at each location may be overkill for users surfing the internet. I am thinking there might be better/more cost effective alternatives. Or whether a hosted solution like zScaler or a competitor would be more cost effective. Ideally whatever solution we choose should have some way to integrate with an XDR platform.
 WWYD?
 thanks

                              <span>Hello, 
 I am a lab equipment technician, and ran into a configuration I was unfamiliar with today and was wondering if some here might be able to help me understand a bit better. My networking knowledge is probably about a 4 out of 10. 
 We have an analyzer that processes patient samples and sends that data to an information management system. Normally its all TCP/IP, which allows me to easily switch the analyzer between communicating with a production server and a test server by switching the IP and PORT (which are both static). However I ran into one today that was configured with an ethernet to RS232 adapter. 
 Basically, 
 Analyzer(and analyzer PC) &gt; Lantronix Box &gt; Management System. 
 Parallel to that, 
 Analyzer(and analyzer PC)&gt;Firewall&gt;client network&gt;analyzer diagnostic report exports to a website I can access from home. 
 I was just wondering what the purpose of running a seperate RS232/TCP/IP converter to the management system would be, if the analyzer and management system could be ran all via TCP/IP (which is what I normally see). 
 I tried to keep it concise without being too vague, but if there are more details I should include please let me know. 
 Thank you!

                              <span>Greetings. I&#x27;m struggling with creating an IPSEC connection between colocated server running Debian 11 and KVM/QEMU.
 It seems there&#x27;s something &quot;mysterious&quot; about the virbr0 interface. I have a tunnel created using Strongswan IPSEC but it really only works in one direction. It acts like a firewall issue, but I&#x27;ve tried many things that make me believe it&#x27;s more of a fundamental limitation of QEMU/Libvirt/virbr0.
 I&#x27;ve have created several tunnels with Strongswan, but this roadblock has me stumped.
 Has anyone successfully created an IPSEC tunnel with KVM host using strongswan and the default virbr0 network? I&#x27;d like to have my VMs reachable over the IPSEC tunnel and also allow the VMs to reach my local LAN.
 I can reach the VMs without issue, but I can&#x27;t connect from the VM to my local LAN. I noticed the issue when trying to connect two KVM hypervisors over the internet with Strongswan IPSEC. I&#x27;ve been running Strongswan to connect to my VMs in the cloud for over a year, but never realized the tunnel really doesn&#x27;t work in the other direction (other than ping/ICMP works).
 The basic oddity is like this: I can ping a remote LAN host over the tunnel, but if I run traceroute, it tries to go to the public interface first, which leads me to believe it&#x27;s a limitation of virbr0.
 If anyone would like to help, here are my iptables on the kvm host.
 Local LAN &#x3D; 192.168.7.0.24
 Remote virbr0/KVM LAN &#x3D; 192.168.222.0/24
 Here&#x27;s the strongswan config.
 I think the workaround is to create a tunnel using Wireguard, but I hate being defeated and would really like to learn what I&#x27;m doing wrong or not understanding.
 Thanks in advance to anyone willing to contribute.

                              <span>Yep, the heading is the TL;DR.
 I recently purchased a SonicWall TZ270 for the family business as there was no sort of security infrastructure before. This is replacing what was just a basic home router.
 Ever since the firewall was implemented, there has been intermittent internet connectivity happening roughly 3x an hour lasting from 10 seconds-2 minutes. edit: closer to 5 minutes.
 ​
 Here is the current configuration:
 X0 - LAN 192.168.0.x
 X1 - WAN
 X3 - DEV 192.168.7.x
 X4 - SRV 192.168.5.x
 DHCP and DNS are on a Windows Server on the SRV network with IP Helper on the SonicWall. No issues with either of those.
 Ports are open for 2 services on 2 different servers - configured with wizard.
 ​
 Diagnosing:
 - Confirmed there are no duplicate DHCP or DNS servers
 - Disabled failover probing (known SW issue)
 - Ran packet traces
 - Pinged internal IP&#x27;s, external IP&#x27;s, internal hostnames, external hostnames for info
 - Reset to factory defaults, reconfigured as bare-metal as possible
 ​
 It looks like when the internet connectivity drops, I lose access to the WAN, both hostnames and IP&#x27;s, but not anything on the internal network. I managed to catch the drop on 1 packet trace on the firewall and it dropped nearly 400 packets in a split second, all blaming either multicast not being configured, or something on the wrong subnet (known issue with this ISP).
 ​
 Is there ANYTHING else I can check? Or do I throw this out and just get a Sophos?

                              <span>Hi, I have been racking my brain and researching this issue for about a week now. Sorry if this doesn&#x27;t fit here.
 The issue I&#x27;ve been having, is that from a oracle cloud ampere server (with a 4 Gbps link) located about 1200 km away, with 34 ms of latency, I cannot seem to get more than about 100 Mbps to my local connection. 
 I have tested it using iperf3, and even if I tinker with the settings to adjust threads it will not get any more than 100 Mbps. I have changed the mtu on both machines, changed the max tcp window size, and tried to change the hardware settings for nics on both of the machines. When I run a udp iperf3 test, I can reach the maximum speed my connection allows (1 Gbps).
 The reason why I believe more bandwidth should be possible is that when I use a wireguard vpn, I can reach tcp speeds through that connection to the server, above 600 mbps. Also, a speedtest from the server to a local speedtest server is about 1500 Mbps, and my connection to that same speedtest is at 1000 Mbps.
 I am not sure if this is just bad routing, or bandwidth delay product. Could someone shed some light on this?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am experiencing some very odd TLS negotiation behavior between one of our clients and the webserver/LB (different sites).
 This is only affecting one LB for only one subnet in our VDI env (no other client has presented any problems).
 I can see traffic is leaving the VDI firewall and hitting the edge in front of the web server and then leaving, however, the FW outside our VDI env is not seeing any return traffic (I find this odd since Wireshark on the client shows reset packets as well as other ACK being sent from the webserver).
 Now here is where TLS comes in. I am seeing in a Wireshark capture multiple other connections going through the same edge FWs are negotiating at TLS v1.2 and are successful. But only this one is negotiating by default as TLS v1.0 by the client and then getting a reset (since we reject v1.0 and 1.1). I have tried forcing TLS v1.2 at the browser level on the client and it still negotiates at v1.0.
 The only thing I haven&#x27;t tried (since I don&#x27;t have admin access to the VDI machines) is doing the windows OS-level registry change for removing TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>I have recently taken a position as IT director and my predecessor was painfully parsimonious - to the extent that he was bragging about getting our main production switches - HP 1910&#x27;s from an online seller of refurbished gear for $150 each. Now, one of our several firewalls (no, I don&#x27;t know why there are several, but there are) has failed, and we have consumed the cold spare that was on the shelf, but the device is old enough to no longer be available for sale new. I&#x27;d like to unify our firewall duties into a single unit (or, preferably an HA pair), and wanted to see if anyone here has advise about any of the devices I&#x27;m considering. I have a personal bias toward the Palo&#x27;s, since I spent the last two years piloting a pair of 5220s. Also, my network manager has an interest in Fortinet in particular, since they offer a full stack of gear - FW, switches, and APs. I also am not interested in Cisco, partly because the $250k order I placed at my former place of employment is on month 14 without fulfillment, with no end in sight. 
 Here&#x27;s the list, and thanks for looking:

                              <span>Been googling this for awhile. I know it&#x27;s possible because I&#x27;ve seen it enabled on another Watchguard before but don&#x27;t know how it got set up. Under System &gt; SNMP I can see you can set it for read but I can&#x27;t figure out how to write.

                              <span>We have four Netgear S3300-28X-PoE+ that are stacked functioning as layer 2 switches. I will speak about one switch to make this scenario simpler. VLAN 1 - all ports are untagged. VLAN 10 - 1-26 are tagged while 27-28 are untagged. VLan 10 - 1-26 are tagged while 27-28 are untagged. Upstream router is acting as the DHCP server for each of these VLANs but each VLAN is configured on a different subnet on the upstream router. 
 ​
 My question is how does the upstream router know which subnet to serve DHCP on?

                              <span>So there is this setup
 10.0.10.0/24 - Working
 10.0.20.0/24 - Non working
 When request sent from pgadmin client to pgpool from non-working subnet, it takes about 15seconds for only one single packet to get processed. This happens at start of connection after three-way handshake.
 After that particular packet, subsequent packets are having &lt;1ms RTT.
 From the same non-working setup, if we bypass pgpool, and directly access db, it works well.
 What could possibly causing this issue?
 It is consistently reproducible.
 Have asked this question in r/PostgreSQL but no conclusive help yet.

                              <span>Hi All, We are using multiple windows servers connected directly on firewall which is working in HA (High Availability - Fortinet) . On server side we are using switch independent teaming with dynamic load balancing with specific standby server. Whenever firewall changes from primary to secondary due to one link failure on one of server, primary firewall switches off all its connected ports to change connected servers teaming on standby mode. Now after sometimes primary firewall&#x27;s all port switches on though secondary firewall is running. Now as server&#x27;s active ports are on server teaming switches back to primary and firewall still in passive mode. Is there any way I can retain server NIC teaming to last state irrespective of primary port availability on server 2019.
 Thanks in Advance. Pardon for grammatical or any other mistake as I am new to this community.

                              <span>We are located in a small office, with lots of computers on the same subnet. The layout is pretty simple. We have an old windows 2012 server that acts as a DHCP server. A few switches and access points for wifi devices. On the edge of the network there is a Cisco firepower 1120 outside connected to the ISP and inside is connected to the main switch. We use this for RA VPN and we can reach the internet through this. We have no router, only switches and acces points.
 The problem is when the firewall is down the subnet becomes unresponsive, devices cannot ping eachother, sometimes new devices do net get IP addresses. If the firewall is removed computers should be able to arp and find other devices, and we should still get IP addresses since we have a DHCP server. In the firewall DHCP server is disabled. 
 We had an old ASA firewall and the issue was the same with that one, but I would like to get to the bottom of this problem. The firewall config is almost default, one acl to allow internet access, dhcp disabled, RA VPN enabled. NAT is the default dynamic inside,outside.
 ​
 Does anyone have an idea what could be the problem? Does this has anything to do with proxy arp?

I have Reolink POE cameras that I need to have placed in areas where having a Ethernet cable is unsustainable... So I&#x27;m thinking, if I get two WPA3 Wifi extenders (that supports PMF) and connect one into the POE switch and the other to the camera. Will this work? Will it protect me from Deauth attacks?
 Or does anyone have any better solution?

Most of our users with macbooks can use it as well with the integrated osx von client, just one runs into a problem. he tries to connect and gets after a while the message that there was a timeout. Server did not respond.
 The ppp.log says: IPSEC connection started IPSEC phase 1 client started IPSEC connection failed publish_entry SCDSet() failed: Success!
 The OSX version is macOS Monterey 12.6
 Does anyone have an idea what could be causing this or maybe even a solution/workaround?
 If something&#x27;s unclear, I&#x27;d be glad to provide more information :)

                              <span>I am trying to understand how likely a Cyclic Redundancy Check is to fail, given a particular divisor P(x). I am specifically interested if there are an odd number of bit flips in my message, an example to follow.
 Some prerequisite info:
 CRC is a very commonly used way to detect errors in computer networks.
 P(x), G(x), R(x), and T(x) are all polynomials under binary field arithmetic (i.e., all coefficients are mod2: 0 or 1).
 P(x) is the polynomial that we are given and that we will divide by.
 E(x) is an error pattern. It is XORed with T(x) to get T&#x27;(x). G(x) is the message that we want to send.
 R(x) is the remainder of G(x)/P(x) or just G(x)modP(x).
 T(x) is our sent data, (x^k)G(x)+R(x), where k is the degree of P(x).
 T&#x27;(x) is our received data but potentially with errors.

                              <span>I’m currently getting a fibre link between two sites finished up and we ran into a snag. We were supposed to have dark fibre provided, but the contractor who did the splicing did it wrong. The fibre belongs to a local telco and the alternative they are looking at is to patch it at their CO, but this makes me a bit nervous as it makes the link completely out of my control. 
 To put my mind at ease I’ve been thinking about encrypting the traffic, but it’s not something I’ve done before. The switches are both Cisco 9200L. Is it relatively easy to accomplish and is there any added latency?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey everyone not sure if i am in the right place and i am not sure if anyone went through this or heard of someone going through this but i have been overthinking about this situation for the past weeks. 
 So I have been working for a company as a Help Desk Analyst i went in as a contractor and most recently i have been made full time my manager put me on a slack call with him and he told me the news 
 Before all this happened he knew for a while that i want to be a system administrator it has been my dream job he asked our director who runs the system administration team and he told my manager to tell me that he is not looking for anyone new at the moment 
 after he told me that he went on to say that I will be training you once a week and i told him that is very generous of you because he has a very busy schedule my manager is our service desk manager and he also does system administration
 I just want to know after all the training is “done” what happens to me because my manager went on to tell me that if my director does need a system administrator it won’t be for 2 to 3 years obviously he is just guessing and doesn’t know for sure. 
 I am really appreciative of the fact my manager is gonna trian me and i will get to learn and leverage my skills but i am young i don’t want to be in help desk for another second and i definitely do not want to wait 2 to 3 years to become system administrator 
 I am sorry for the long speech i just want to know after all the training is “done” what happens after? 
 also my manager told me “don’t worry you definitely will not stay in help desk” he tells me i am very ambitious.

                              <span>Hey,
 So Rackspace screwed up bigly and took down e-mail for over a week (ongoing). We&#x27;ve migrated all of our users to Office 365 and are currently using the Admin Center. 
 We want to totally disassociate from Rackspace completely-- but all the Office 365 Suite licenses are held there. We plan on purchasing them directly through O365 admin center--- but my main question is:
 Would we have to uninstall and re-install Office 365, or are we good as it stands?

                              <span>Here is a link to the original.
 So I set up a meeting with my boss and I fumbled through a shitty 2 weeks notice. I told him I’m leaving. I didn’t want to hurt the guys feelings so I told him I need to be remote to be able to support my family more which is true but mainly I was sick of the constant lack of support while being handed project after project while trying to be an entire IT department for a large organization. 
 I kid you not I got the 5 stages of grief from him.
 In no particular order:
 Denial- what do you mean? Your not putting in your 2 weeks notice are you?
 Anger- There is no way I am going to be able to replace you by the deadline! Who gave you an offer? How much?
 Bargaining- Would you stay if gave you 5 grand? Can you please stay until march, I’ll let you work from home! We can work with you. Please let me work with you!
 Depression- I thought we were friends. I can take care of you. Give me a chance please! 
 Acceptance- you’ll want to hand in a formal notice of resignation if this is what you really want. 
 I didn’t want to tell him I accept an offer anywhere else but he kept patronizing me by telling me that money is gonna be tight and shit so i finally told him I got an offer somewhere else that gives me more freedom. He kept fucking grilling me to give him a chance to do good by me but it just felt weird. I told him I’d sleep on it cause I felt bad but I told him not to expect me to change my mind. Now he’s fucking texting me outside of work saying he spoke with the ceo so they can “make it work” for me to work remotely most of the time.
 TLDR; Gave 2 weeks notice and tried to be nice by focusing on a personal priority of mine instead of telling my boss what i really think and it back fired. 
 I’m handing in a formal resignation tomorrow hopefully it’s all just acceptance from there out.

 This is my first post on this subreddit and one of my first post ever, I want to start by giving context to my little BIG issue; you see I started working in this small financial company on the rise a year ago, a lot has changed since my first day as a data entry clerk on quickbooks, and now we have evolved to become a big company, in this process of becoming bigger and bigger I was changed positions to become the IT manager even though I was not hired for such position.
 Between the things I helped do to evolve the company are the following things:
  
Changed back office to improve workflow.
 Started the process to transform our company into a online solution provider for our very wealthy costumers.
 Added an mdm system for our company and made the company soc2 compliant (after…</span>

 Not the worst description I&#x27;ve seen, but still very unhelpful. Not sure why it&#x27;s so hard for users to provide any details. Is this a file from a website? Some internal application? Elsewhere? Are you using a browser? Which one? Are there any error messages? At the very least, can you provide a phone number that I can call to talk to you to get this information?
 I gently responded to the ticket asking for more details (including some prompts to make it easier). Crickets.
 Sorry for the rant.

I&#x27;m using standard 20 outlets rack-mounted PDU&#x27;s but have special power supplies that have 4 outlets one for each modem. The problem I have here is that if I want to reset a modem remotely I need to take down the 4 modems attached to the PDU. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone knows of an enterprise USB-C managed PDU, preferably with 50-100 usb outlets per PDU.

                              <span>Is there even a big software company that provides even middling support these days?
 This weekend was a final migration from on-prem file server to Box. Users had been warned for weeks that this was coming, that the Box app had already been pushed to their computer, and that they needed to sign in to see how it worked so they would understand how everything worked and how to access shared files once the server is down.
 Of course most users ignored this and so, expecting exactly that, I was on site first thing today to get them going.
 Unfortunately things went sideways and most people who hadn&#x27;t already signed in were unable to. The company uses Google Workspace so Box had been added as a SSO app through SAML, but signing in with their Google credentials either produced a prompt to create a password (???) or an error saying &quot;invalid credentials&quot;.
 I immediately created a ticket with tons of detail and SAML traces, got a pretty quick reply from a T1 tech who said that the accounts I referenced didn&#x27;t have passwords and could I please have the users create them. After a bit of back and forth about what &quot;SSO&quot; stands for he escalated the ticket.
 Hours passed. Frantic web searches yielded nothing. I looked through the SAML traces myself and couldn&#x27;t find anything (I know nothing about web dev but figured I&#x27;d try). I called the Box account manager, who also &quot;escalated&quot;. Updated the ticket email with more details. Called the account manager again. Had the customer&#x27;s CFO call the account manager with me on the line.
 5 hours later I got a reply from someone claiming to be a T2 tech, asking for a SAML trace from an affected user.

 Will start pinging you using technical terminology, basically just combining words together that don&#x27;t make any sense. 
 Then he&#x27;s bugging out about VLAN ID&#x27;s - Apparently using VLAN ID&#x27;s as 10/20/30/40/50 makes no sense to him. So instead VLAN ID&#x27;s have to 100 / 300 / 500 / 700 
 Won&#x27;t get on a call to clarify any of the nonsense he&#x27;s asking you to do, won&#x27;t answer you when you have a follow up question and then 30 minutes later will ping you back asking if you finished doing what he asked you to do.

                              <span>Hey all,
 ​
 I left my previous role (Head of IT (was very hands-on/3rd line)) for an educational establishment in early 2021 as I needed a break and wanted to try something new (self empself-employedloyed retail business).
 ​
 It&#x27;s been almost two years, and I&#x27;m ready to jump back into IT but struggling to land an interview.
 ​
 I do not want to go back into management. I always enjoyed the sysadmin and project side of the role, but I hated the management side. It wasn&#x27;t my choice to get into management but something that happened over several years.
 ​
 Anyway, I&#x27;ve been applying for 2nd line/3rd line support roles as well as project-based infrastructure engineer roles. I haven&#x27;t had one interview request with about 60 applications.
 ​
 I&#x27;m considering spending some downtime to re-train for a specific role since my previous roles were very general sysadmin and network support.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve considered either Cloud or Cyber Sec, but leaning more towards Cloud as I am more familiar with it. Likely Azure as I have had exposure to it. 
 ​
 My questions are:
  
If I pass a couple of Azure certs, am I likely to get a Azure-based role without practical experience working with Azure, considering I have 10 years of network/IT support experience?
 What over avenues can I go down to try to land a job back in IT?
  
​
 Thanks

                              <span>Ubiquiti/Unifi still just seems completely non-ready for the workplace, and I&#x27;ve been using them for years now in spite of it.
 Trying to work on a budget here, so good Meraki gear is out of the question. A year or two ago or so, one of the UniFi &quot;controller&quot; upgrades put a bunch of our older, perfectly-functioning AP&#x27;s out of management scope. They still run but we can&#x27;t change any SSID settings or even see how many clients are connected because the hardware is EOL. I could understand a nag screen or something, but to actually take functionality away from perfectly functional hardware? Come on now.
 So we bite the bullet and pick up some new U6-LR AP&#x27;s. Oh fantastic, now they are pulling 16+ watts each and overpowering the PoE switches, leading to constant reboots of the APs. Cool - it&#x27;s one of the bugs that is fixed in the new UniFi &quot;Network Application&quot;, let&#x27;s upgrade that again.
 Nope! That requires installing Java 11, which seems to be either unobtainable or undetectable, because I&#x27;ve installed at least 3 different versions of JDK, OpenJDK, some weird third-party extraction of JRE 11, and some other garbage, just for the UniFi installer to tell me it still needs Java 11 and quit the installer. Why does the latest Unifi software not use the latest Java? We&#x27;re on version 19 now for God&#x27;s sake.
 So now I can&#x27;t access old hardware, can&#x27;t use new hardware, can&#x27;t upgrade the software, and if I&#x27;m able to install it I&#x27;m sure I will run into some other new stupidity, plus have to hack my way into making it a service again because it&#x27;s only a console application for some ridiculous reason.

                              <span>My company is a late adopter of the cloud, though they want to go to the cloud. For On Prem we use mainly Hyper-V for Windows and RHEV for Linux. I am on the Linux side and trying to create a gold image as we don&#x27;t want to use the Market Place images, due to costs and mnagement. We have about a half dozen subscriptions for Azure and each one has many resource groups. 
 ​
 In tests it looks like the market place image is easy to deploy, though it isn&#x27;t what we want. Looks like custom images are tied directly into the resource group and I think, if I undrestand it correctly, we need to have a gallery to be able to use an image within the other resource groups in the same subscription, though need a seperate gallery for each subscription? It feels like there are a lot of different settings when it comes to creating an image and Azure is very picky, yet very unforgiving about things. Simple things like changing names of the image can&#x27;t be done, you have to create a new image w/ the name you want.
 ​
 Due to inforced RBAC, we can only create and delete VMs, we can&#x27;t create Images, which is an internal problem that we have. So it doesn&#x27;t help that we have a seperate team working on it, though we are trying to have that role added to our group. The other team, which is part of the Windows Team uses Market Place Image for their stuff, so they don&#x27;t have much experience with creating gold images.
 ​
 Also the latency between the cloud and our on prem enviornment seems to introduce a lot of other issues, we have to up timeouts in tools that we have no issue communicating across the country to our sister DC, though communicating between our DC and Azure in the same side of the country has time out issues.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 A little background info before we start : I am originaly come from a software developper background. After some misshaps in my personal life, i&#x27;ve had difficulties finding a job as a developper. I then decided to apply for helpdesk positions at multiple local companies and landed myself a job at the local university.The job was advertised as a &quot;helpdesk&quot; position.
 I&#x27;ve been working there for the past 1.5 years. The transition with the person before me was a little rocky at first since i had so much to learn in so little time (AD / GPOs / Imaging / Networking ...) and i&#x27;m still learning new stuff everyday.
 I manage around 150-200 Windows 10 machines. The department uses a variety of CAD softwares ( CATIA / Inspire / MoldFlow / MSC Patran_Nastran / Vericut ...) but they mostly use SolidWorks.
 The person before used to create a windows image every year with the latest version of the softwares they use. This created a problem where the images he created were at the very least 75gb. I&#x27;ve been able to move away from this by automating most of the installs with scripts.
 Now that i think i have the basics down, i&#x27;d like to optimize the process and find ways to deal with SolidWorks configs in a multi-user environment.

 I have hosted Nginx on AlmaLinux 9 for while, it has been working fine. Just serving static files nothing else, not running any dynamic web app the CPU barely hit 1% usage. And along with it there is Grafana Agent running.
 But I have notice the system is taking lot of memory as a cache is it normal?
 And how can I check from which process this cache memory is generated.
 Here is the memory usage from free -m command:
  total used free shared buff/cache available Mem: 23979 977 448 223 23094 23002 Swap: 0 0 0 
 Thanks!

                              <span>What do you call an occasional attempt to hack into one of your accounts? It&#x27;s not persistent, but once a day, a service from the same IP tries a couple accounts and then gives up. We are blocking the IP (and noticed it was listed on AbuseIP), but wondered if this really would be described a brute force attack. Seems more like a lazy attempt attack. Can a brute force attack run the gamut from &quot;one account/attempt&quot; a day/week, to persistent attempts with no stopping?

                              <span>Why do employers torture us with 24-grit toilet paper that could be used to refinish hardwood floors? Is it really too much to ask they have nice, fluffy pillow-like TP to pamper our asses, given how much they&#x27;re normally reaming us? I get employers like to discourage employees spending an excessive amount of time in the stall (besides, are we really wasting company time sitting there on the throne if we&#x27;re closing tickets as we sit there?), but crappy TP doesn&#x27;t discourage multiple visits -- it just means we have to bring our own.

                              <span>Hi. 
 So we have a few locations where machines are randomly dying, (dell and hp), the users sometimes see an applocker style message saying an application cannot be run, please contact your system administrator, then if they reboot the machine goes into a state where it never fully boots, no real pattern at all, only oddity is they are all W10 pro boxes, and applocker is present in the domain, but those SKU&#x27;s cannot run applocker (although it is logging that).
 This has only just started happening (1 end of last week, now we are seeing a lot more), anyone else seeing this?

 ​
 ​
 ​
 We have been doing some hardening work on server 2022. We had a company do a vulnerability assessment on our network and they found an issue on one of our servers.
 ​
 i have observed &quot;SSL 64-bit Block Size Cipher Suites Supported (SWEET32)&quot;
 ​
 ​
 I got this solution from vulnerability team , but don&#x27;t know how to apply fix for the same.
 ​
 ​
 BTW, already disabled TLS 1.0 and 1.1 
 ​
 ​
 List of 64-bit block cipher suites supported by the remote server : Medium Strength Ciphers (&gt; 64-bit and &lt; 112-bit key, or 3DES) Name Code KEX Auth Encryption MAC ---------------------- ---------- --- ---- --------------------- --- DES-CBC3-SHA 0x00, 0x0A RSA RSA 3DES-CBC(168) SHA1 The fields above are : {Tenable ciphername} {Cipher ID code} Kex&#x3D;{key exchange} Auth&#x3D;{authentication} Encrypt&#x3D;{symmetric encryption method} MAC&#x3D;{message authentication code} {export flag}

 Onto the topic:
 An employee used a BitLocker usb drive due to personal reasons for data transport, and upon arrival one of the folders ended up corrupted.
 Is there anything I can do to help recover the data?
 Currently the folder looks like this: https://imgur.com/a/auPfdPv
 Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>So we moved our Windows update control to our MSP so we have no control over these anymore &amp; I&#x27;m also not sure of the visibility.
 We&#x27;ve noticed every Wednesday they are installed, we&#x27;ll have a random user or 2 that then can&#x27;t get on via DA the next day from home. A few reboots and appears to resolve itself.
 One machine I looked at I ran
 WMIC qfe list full (not sure how accurate this command is)
 On the Wednesday it showed KB5020487 installed on a machine and then the next day DA didn&#x27;t work. A few reboots later it was back working.
 Searching for KB5020487 it doesn&#x27;t exist on Microsoft&#x27;s KB catalog. I&#x27;ve now looked at other machines that haven&#x27;t had DA issues but also seeing KBs being installed on the Wednesday that have no Microsoft link in their &quot;caption&quot; entry and don&#x27;t appear in the catalog. Another one on mine I&#x27;ve found from November KB5020372.
 n-able is the MPS software they use.
 UPDATE before finished typing :
 Looked at a machine that has Windows 11 that&#x27;s not on the domain and it to has entries with a KB installed that has no reference in the catalog KB5017233. This odd entries are appearing in Windows 10 machines as well.
 Odd.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am currently overthinking/revising my digital working environment, tackling some of the annoying things I experienced in the past usage. Like probably most Sysadmins and being a tech-savvy person I have more than one device I work with and bringing my IT knowledge/experience to my home network there are even more devices involved.
 I hope getting your inspiration and experiences on a topic on which Google searches lead me nowhere due to plentily used keywords like &quot;sysadmin&quot;, &quot;windows&quot;, &quot;tools&quot;, &quot;application&quot;, &quot;configuration&quot; and so on. Those keywords lead to posts/threads like &quot;Must have tools for sysadmin&quot; and consorts.
 My train of thought which lead to my old setup was, to use portable versions of my needed tools whenever possible.
 Advantages:

                              <span>I am trying to wrap my head around a problem.
 In our environment we have end users which might be using any type of means to access an application (mobile, browser, citrix). Then this goes to a SaaS, then to k8s in GCP, then to an in-house developed App which is on-prem, and then to a good old backend (also on-prem). 
 Is it possible at all to keep the session ID as you pass all these steps, so that your modern session-based performance troubleshooting which you get in the microservices world, as you move to your legacy apps (in my case everything after the GCP). 
 I am trying to get at least the right keywords to google to be able to start building an understanding as to what it takes to have e2e APM in a landscape like that, if it&#x27;s at all possible.

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;ve got a broken Server 2016 (HRESULT &#x3D; 0x800f0805 - CBS_E_INVALID_PACKAGE on everything, no installed updates found, not able to add/remove roles and features, etc)
 This is a single domain-controller environment and I need to get this lifted over to a new install. (2019/2022)
 Migrating the DC itself is an OK process, but what is the most effective and least troublesome way of transferring folder redirection for 40 users to the new DC?
 I&#x27;ve done this once before by just robocopying eveything (with permissions and so forth) and all and change the path on the GPO, but two years later I still have calls regarding old paths.
 I&#x27;ve read that &quot;copy content&quot; is a dangerous option and I assume copying everything back to local requires everyone to re-log and will cause performance issues?
 Another thing I&#x27;ve read is to use DFS, however I have never touched DFS - is this the best way?
 I&#x27;d like to do it the correct way this time - what would be the best way? How is this done by the book with no future shit happening?
 EDIT: I&#x27;ve seen this Storage Migration Services as well, but that claims that DC&#x27;s are not supported

                              <span>I created a self-signed SSL certificate and it only works on port 80 I then tried to replace it with a lets-encrypt certificate. I deleted all of the certificate files, I have tried to restart docker and the daemon. I have also tried to remove the override file that I tried to put the certificate in. To create the self-signed SSL certificate, I used the following script https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexisAhmed/DockerSecurityEssentials/main/Docker-TLS-Authentication/secure-docker-daemon.sh
 For the override.conf file within /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/override.conf I used the following configuration: [Service]ExecStart&#x3D;ExecStart&#x3D;/usr/bin/dockerd -D -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock --tlsverify --tlscert&#x3D;/home//.docker/server-cert.pem --tlscacert&#x3D;/home//.docker/ca.pem --tlskey&#x3D;/home//.docker/server-key.pem -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2376
 I have restarted the docker container but that has also failed to work.
 Furthermore, I have also deleted the ssl certificate so I have no idea where it is pulling the old on from.

                              <span>I work in a wholesaler company with only 40 employees. We still do a lot of IT things though (Develop our own software. Host this software. we also have our own small datacenter) and have around 6 IT employees.
 In my quest to find a good but still affordable ZTNA and a WAF solution i stumbled upon Cloudflare. It instantly became my favorite IT company in existence.
 Their core belief is &quot;security is something that should be accessible to everyone&quot; and they really actually mean it. If you don&#x27;t know them, let me introduce you to some of their services
  
The fastest DNS resolver in the world with high regards on privacy (free)
 DNS for families that protect against malware and/or adult content (free)
 An extremely affordable ZTNA solution (free for &lt;50 users)
 A WAF, SSL/TLS and DDoS Protection (free for standard usecases)
  
Thank you cloudflare, for making security available to everyone, especially for private usage and small companies too.
 I highly recommend cloudflare, and I am absolutely stunned by their portfolio, their generosity and what they do. Great stuff!

                              <span>I work in the IT Department of a company with a couple of hundred remote users, who are a mix of technicians and sales people who use their devices constantly. Occasionally I need to configure a device and have it sent to them, and because they use it all day, they need it to arrive already configured, logged in, applications set up etc etc.
 ​
 We&#x27;re using InTune with AzureAD authentication, a mixture of Windows laptops/tablets and Android phones. We&#x27;re encrypting the devices before sending them out etc.
 ​
 The main issue I&#x27;m having is that before I can configure a device, I need to contact the user and ask for their password. Sometimes the user is unavailable, and I can&#x27;t get hold of them, which delays things, and I also worry that taking a note of their password is a bad practice.
 ​
 I wonder if there is a way that I can configure the devices and sign into the user&#x27;s corporate accounts on the devices without needing their password. If not, then what is the best practice to do this?

 is it possible to have openldap working both functions, delivering its own data (e.g. group membership), but proxying password authentication to e.g. Active Directory?
 I&#x27;ve read about openldap proxy (with &quot;backend ldap&quot;) in the Samba Wiki, but I&#x27;m not sure it covers my scenario.

                              <span>This is a long shot, but i hope you have some guidance / experience to throw my way in regards to Terminal Servers and FSLogix.
 We have recently begun seeing multiple users complaining that when they are working on a Terminal Server with a multi monitor setup, that they will periodically and at random get disconnected to one of their monitors, so the sessions stays open and they can keep on working, but only on that single monitor.
 They have to completely restart the Terminal Server or do a complete log out and log in, in order for it to connect to both monitors again.
 Hope this makes just some sence, because i sure a heck could not google it
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi fellow sys admins,
 I&#x27;m trying to deal with a very interesting (to me) case. Someone is proxy-mirroring all content of my website under a different domain name.
  
Original: https://www.saashub.com
 Abuser/Proxy-mirror: https://sukuns.us.to
  
My ideas of resolution:
  
Block them by IP - That doesn&#x27;t work as they are rotating the IP from which the request is coming.
 Block them by User Agent - They are duplicating the user-agent of the person making the request to sukuns.us.to
 Add some JavaScript to redirect to the original domain-name - They are stripping all JS.
 Use absolute URLs everywhere - they are rewriting everything www.saashub.com to their domain name.
  
i.e. I&#x27;m out of ideas. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.
 p.s. what is more, Bing is indexing all of SaaSHub&#x27;s content under sukuns.us.to ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I&#x27;ve reported a copyright infringement, but I have a feeling that it could take ages to get resolved.

                              <span>Hello everyone. I recently tried to make my own windows image with sysprep, which works fine. Now I have the following question:
 I would like to have the installer ask for a computer name, and then automatically install the isntall.wim with the pc i name entered. 
 I have about 50 pcs that I need to re-install so this would save me a lot of time.
 ​
 I already tried some things on google but only to find out that oobe doesn&#x27;t support this anymore. 
 i am pretty new to this part of windows so any help is appreciated :)

                              <span>Hi. We have a bunch of new laptops and most of them has Office 2010 installed (yeah, old, but this is a policy, can&#x27;t comply). So, I started to receive a lot of tickets with Office Troubles. In finance department the Excel freezes when opening budget model, yet same file on another user opening fine (same laptop, different users). In most departments the Outlook isn&#x27;t showing mail text and PowerPoint is messing up the linked files. 
 In most cases I solved it with office updates, but some are still persist.
 Any recommendations? We&#x27;re using Office 2010 32-Bit (because of macross support), Domain Network, Win 10

                              <span>I run a vpn server with the interface tun0 on a server. I want to open the SSH port on this server so that the ssh connection is allowed only after VPN authentication.
 Which of the following firewall rules is correct:
  
specifying the tunnel:
 ufw allow in on tun0 from any to any port 22 
 
specifying the VPN IP address:
 ufw allow from 10.8.0.2 to any port 22 
 
 Let’s say the server is at 10.8.0.1, and there is only one client at 10.8.0.2. 
 For the second rule, the interface tun0 is not specified. The IP address 10.8.0.2 is not unique. What if the packet comes from an external private IP 10.8.0.2 to the default interface eth0, not from the 10.8.0.2 in the tunnel ? It seems to me the interface must be specified not the IP, to restrict SSH to VPN.
 For the first rule, I suppose the request from 10.8.0.2 first goes to the VPN gateway, say, 10.8.0.0, and then to 10.8.0.1. So shouldn’t it be “from 10.8.0.0”?
 Another question: For the “to any,” if I specify “to 10.8.0.1,” would that prevent NAT masquerading, thus login rejection?

 These utilities make troubleshooting quite effective. Yes I know about Wireshark and use it regularly but man running journalctl commands and debugging all the daemons is wonderful
 I&#x27;d like having this on cisco routers and switches. After running white box networking systems I almost can&#x27;t go back to Cisco because it feels so clunky and limited 
 Not sure I ever want to work in Cisco world again

 Of course it doesn&#x27;t mean their masters is in any technology related field, but still, let&#x27;s say that&#x27;s the case - why are people wasting money in master degrees that will get them nowhere and then try to get into information technology?
 ​
 I&#x27;m sorry for the rant, I&#x27;m dumbfounded and at the same time upset that 60 percent of applicants for a position I thought I had a good shot at, have masters.
 Or are people just applying to jobs they will not get to put something on like unemployment benefits paperwork?

                              <span>I have a ton of responsibilities in my position. I am touching so many things which includes doing level one stuff sometimes but also being the only project engineer on complex solutions that are going to be deployed globally.
 I feel like I&#x27;m putting my nose to the grindstone and sometimes only take 15 minutes of my 1 hour break allowance and most days I feel like I got nothing done because I only got done with the issues that cropped up on that day and my to do list is just as long as when I first walked in the door.
 While my director hasn&#x27;t explicitly said it yet, I can tell that he feels like I&#x27;m not making enough progress on these projects that he has assigned me. I&#x27;m not sitting here complaining, but rather I don&#x27;t know of any reliable method to determine if it&#x27;s something that I&#x27;m doing incorrectly or if too much is being asked of me.

                              <span>I was so looking forward to enjoying a lazy Sunday with the Mrs. when I get a text from on of my customers. A SAP HANA server is not accessible and it’s got to be fixed ASAP. This is the start of an all day into the late evening odyssey of trying to find login credentials to one of the few physical servers that no one knows how to access. I then had to drive to the office and then over an hour to the data center, to try and figure out how to get into the old Hitachi Symphony Blade 2000 server. After numerous issues creating a jump box vm to get into the ancient remote console, I was finally able to get into the machine. No big surprise that this server has an uptime of 2768 days. I’ve been with the company for 3 years. The issue is not yet resolved but since I can now get to the console, I’m turning it back over to the customer to figure out so I can go home.

                              <span>Hi Team,
 Calling all HP 3Par all stars - am I barking up the wrong tree here? Can I do this, will it work?
 We&#x27;ve recently decommissioned/replaced three x HP 3Par SAN&#x27;s. 1 x 7200 and 2 x 8200&#x27;s. All are still functional, just out of maintenance.
 I&#x27;m contemplating building a Frankenmonster play unit and/or get out of jail free card should bad things happen.
 My thoughts were to take one of the 8200&#x27;s (being newer) and harvest the others for all the good stuff - SSD&#x27;s, RAM, an external disk shelf from the 7200 etc and build something as big and as good as possible given the bits I&#x27;ve got.
 Can I do this with the 3Par platform? I do it all the time with old servers, what about storage?
 Oh - and this will all be 100% offline too - I&#x27;ve kept the old FC switches and a couple of old ESX hosts to build an unsupported play area.
 Any thoughts/comments/traps greatly appreciated.
 Cheers,

                              <span>So I manage a network for a school. It has around 400 users( students, teachers etc) and has around 200 computers but there not managed by a ad server or any server, there are some print server and smb share but it&#x27;s kinda minimum for that many devices. So I asked if I could set up a ad server for loging in and deploying software. They said there&#x27;s no money for buying a windows server standard license. My thought to overcome this issue is to install ad server on a Linux server. But with that many users and many features like wsus and many other features not present in Linux ad implementation is it a good idea or should I just leave it alone and make milion local users

                              <span>Hi All,
 We were asked to block all RDPs on our network, and while I have most successfully blocked wither via the firwall or GPO, Splashtop seems to be a massive issue for us. We cannot block it through the firewall, and we are talking to the vendors as they are just as confused as we are. HOWEVER, I decided to block splashtop via GPO and it it still gains access to the internal PCs. 
 I have it blocked for users and computers using both the &#x27;don&#x27;t run specified application&#x27; and software restriction policies and the app still gets through. Any idea what the hell is going on? I have never seen this crap before.

 We have mixed environment such as office 2013 , 2016 or 2019.
 my question: how do you organize GPOs in the environment where different office versions are installed? Let&#x27;s say if I set up a GPO that only affects office 2019 and apply it to the entire Computer OU, will only office 2019 ones be affected by this policy? Or What&#x27;s best practices ?

 Hey folks,
 I am using netsh interface portproxy to port forward on my Windows machine.The problem I&#x27;ve been facing is that whenever I reboot the computer, I need to re-add the rules again.
 I&#x27;ve been trying to find a solution for quite some time now and have not found anything that would solve the problem.
 Any ideas on what might be causing it and how to fix it?
 ​
 Thank you!

                              <span>So I&#x27;m a short-timer who is part of the first round of layoff coming up in a few months which means job hunting time. I&#x27;m also 42 with only one kid left at home but she has one foot out the door so it&#x27;ll just be my wife and the cat with little expenses so I&#x27;m OK with the pay cut if it&#x27;s low stress and good bennies. I keep looking at the IT landscape and feel like it&#x27;s going to change very fast over the next few years with consolidation (cloud/saas) and competition for jobs is increasing. I don&#x27;t want to deal with that now.
 I see quite a few government job openings around the 100k range (plus wife&#x27;s salary) and keep thinking that&#x27;s good enough for me to coast until retirement and I know a few folks who work there saying it&#x27;s gravy work. Plus there&#x27;s that 20-and-out retirement I keep reading about. But I don&#x27;t want to be doing absolutely anything though cause that would just suck.
 So anyway, folks who work in the government how do you like it?

 Am I able to provide some kind of files to you to help me diagnose what’s going on with my system? It never does seems to be using all of its resources, and Task Manager show RAM 100% even though the tasks equate to less than 25% 
 I have tried using RAMMAP, which did free up some ram. Also latency mon was showing some problems too

                              <span>We are a state entity with a lot of people. Recently we&#x27;ve been in a ton of meetings about pending changes. Nothing too clear, the meetings are more or less buzzword bingo. I was on LI this morning and saw someone giving props to an outgoing C level (like a step or two under the governor). I click on his profile and he has a picture of an event where they discussed their plans, which would be revealed later. In the background is a whiteboard with the new org and names of who will be doing what, including some names that are crossed out.

                              <span>This is pretty trivial compared to some of the r/nuclearrevenge level stuff I&#x27;ve seen on here, but it still warms the cockles of my heart whenever I do it.
 Among many other things, I am owner, master and commander of my company&#x27;s ERP software. I&#x27;ve got that shit on lockdown. I&#x27;m a certified developer for the software, so all customizations have been done by me since I came on board ~3 years ago. Besides dev level customizations, I&#x27;m also the administrator. Business rules, workflows, permissions and so on.
 I kept getting frantic calls after my work hours from our sales reps that they need me to adjust this customer&#x27;s credit limit (a job for Accounts Receivable during work hours) or they&#x27;re trying to issue some inventory to a client but the system thinks it&#x27;s out of stock, so they need me …</span>

                              <span>Hi there,
 For our organization we need to deploying different PAC files to users depending on their association.
 For historical reasons this is supposed to be done in the form
 http://:8001 -&gt; hand out PAC script1
 http://:8002 -&gt; hand out PAC script2, etc
 Now I just want to make sure my solution is viable.
 My idea is to just take a good old Apache, have it listen on all the required ports and set the DirectoryIndex to the matching PAC file.
 Would that work?

                              <span>The desktop experience is TOP!
 Android smartphone however, I want to get onboard but overall, just frustrating to use...
 Mobile use cons;
 - Text Input mode; sometimes does not register, just continues to collect input but it does not transverse through to the other end.
 - Challenging to call up the in session menu to change input method, swipe from left to right just usually exits the app due to androids native navigation method.
 - Mouse emulation method, I&#x27;ve always defaulted to &quot;drag to move&quot; yet, with this setting enabled, I can no longer pinch to zoom which is another hurdle to overcome.
 Like what are the workarounds to make this an enjoyable experience on a mobile device without a keyboard and mouse?

 my report contains both AR &amp; ENG language

                              <span>I’ve been tasked with expanding a fiber network, tripling the current number of drops. I’ve never done anything like this before. I’ve pulled plenty of single pair fiber and done some SC tipping manually, but nothing on this scale. We’re moving to all LC connections and I’m planning on using a fiber splicer during the install.
 I’m curious to hear what some common pitfalls are and how I can avoid them, and any other tips or tricks anyone has for a project of this scope.

 Security is in France, sys admins in Netherlands and consultancy almost everywhere in the world. 
 Sometimes the relations between the teams is somewhat.... Strained to put it midly. 
 Any tips and advice about how to improve relations between the teams?
 I&#x27;m looking to a shout out solution integrated with our Intranet to praise your colleagues, which can be part of our bonus system eventually. 
 But any other tips are welcome. Processes, regular meetings, more top down structure all already in place.

 Openstack sucks. I want something a little more barebones like a cleaner red hat or something that&#x27;s stable. 
 Just bare bones Ubuntu? I want something with a support contract. Is red hat the best?
 I&#x27;m trying to spit ball things so I can think through this problem. Thanks

                              <span>Hi everyone, I’m new to networking. I was wondering I see my trace route results in the command prompt, how can i calculate the packet’s TTL when it reaches the destination? Does the request timed out count as hops?
 For example, if it the packet starts with a TTL&#x3D;100 and it appears that there is 19 hops in the trace route but two of them are “request timed out”, the TTL will be equal to 19, 17, 18 or 16 (depends if the last row decrease the TTL or no?)

                              <span>Hi, looking for a cost effective firewall, switch &amp; AP stack for mass installs in small business environment. Consider this an environment where the likes of Fortinet, Sonicwall or Palo Alto is cost prohibitive. Have come across vendors that are offering generic devices that can they claim to do the same functions without a lot name recognition. One issue I have run into is the ability assess these devices as they aren&#x27;t put through a lot of certification processes or community voices around them.
 Has anyone been down this path before? what did you look for in a successful implementation. How did your solution scale.

                              <span>I want to replace existing Juniper gear with HPE 5900AF switches. As I don&#x27;t have that much experience with HPE/Comware, I need some help.
 What the setup should look like:
 ​
 2x 10GbE Ports coming from the upstream provider, running BGP on their end. That means: BGP to the upstream provider, announcing multiple IPv4 and v6 subnets but only taking a default route.
 Customers will also terminate on the switch with a seperate vlan for each customer (And on a seperate port for each customer.) Inside of that VLAN, there will be one gateway address .1. 
 Is there something like l3Interface in Comware like it exists on JunOS or how do I connect the customer vlans to the upstream provider with the default route? Or do I need a bridge like interface for this?
 Also, are the switches capable of line rate L3 features like ACLs? Or will they suffer and choke with a few ACLs/sFlow on some ports?
 Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>I have 3 routers. All are ASRs Two are the same building. Call those Router A and B. Router A and B are connected to Router C in a different location via BGP and a VRF. The BGP session is constantly going up and down every few seconds. All routers have BFD enabled. On Router A and B, with the show bfd neighbor command you can see the sessions disappearing consistently. On Router C, you can see the session showing as admin down and then coming back up every few seconds. I don&#x27;t see any MTU or BFF misconfiguration. What am I missing?

Anyway I cant join the server and tried pinging it with CMD but timeout. I tried turning off my firewall but still unable to join and timeouts. And then i pinged from my phone with ICMP and still timeout. But when i pinged with TCP from my phone i got responds. Can anyone help me or tell me where to search for ?

According to Nmap&#x27;s book -sV&#x27;s default is 7, but it also said that higher versions of -sV aren&#x27;t as useful as lower ones. So I tried scanning at a lower version and it worked. Why is that?

                              <span>Canadian based in South America. Currently on the lookout for new clients, but concerned about my rate.
 I&#x27;m a developer and sysadmin. Lots of VMware, Ansible, Docker, OpenVPN. Have a tiny bit of experience with AWS, CI/CD (Github Actions), Networking &amp; Security knowledge. I love Linux, tolerate Windows. Most of my programming experience has been with Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and Python but I&#x27;m learning Golang. 
 Disadvantages: No certs, but I&#x27;m considering studying for one of the AWS certs. I have a half finished CS degree, couldn&#x27;t complete for financial reasons. 
 My current role is independent contractor for a couple small Canadian businesses. I&#x27;m definitely undercharging them ($25/hour CAD) but that&#x27;s a damn good rate here in South America. 
 How much should I be charging new clients?

 However, I would still like to be able to have a profile script, and creating one just results in the message &quot;(path)\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1 cannot be loaded because [...] blah blah execution policy&quot; in every new window.
 The best I&#x27;ve come up with so far is to make an aliased script or program (in some non-powershell language) somewhere in %PATH%, which starts powershell with -bypass, and have &quot;set-executionpolicy Restricted -scope process&quot; as the last line in the profile script - clunky, but at least the spirit of the execution policy would be preserved.

                              <span>Hey there,
 So we just had multiple clients bite the dust when it comes to e-mail because of the whole Rackspace Ransomware attack. I was just wondering if anybody had any tips for getting some of my clients&#x27; Office 365 software clients synced and running correctly. So far my process has been this:
 - Remote in through Teamviewer
 - Open Outlook
 - Backup .PST files (some of these folks have multiple mailboxes, so I make separate backups for each, which is a total pain and very tedious and time consuming)
 - Delete Profile from Control Panel &gt; Mail Credentials
 - Run Outlook &amp; Put In Email Address &amp; P/W
 - Import .PST Files
 There has to be a better way. Like, I thought I should just be able to tell the email software that Hey! This is now Office 365! And then it just automatically swaps over or something. Is this really the only way to do this? Thank you for any help/tips. It is greatly appreciated as it looks like I&#x27;m starring down the barrel of a full week of 10 hour+ days if this is how it has to be. Thank you

                              <span>Hi Guys
 Did anyone ever encounter an Issue with SentinelOne slowing down Search on SMB Shares?
 We have this issue on one fileserver which hosts a lot of files (mostly PDF in sub directories, most of the time one pdf file per sub directory). The software we use searches those files via SMB.
 Did anyone ever come across something like this?
 Thanks!

                              <span>What marketing terminology do you find most enraging? Which buzzwords are the biggest turnoffs?
 I&#x27;ll start:
  
Accelerate innovation
 End-to-end 
 Best practices
 The developer experience
  
There are valid reasons to use all of these, but 90% of the time... nope. 
 If I get enough response to this, I&#x27;m thinking of turning into a listicle of &quot;N Buzzwords That Developers and Sysadmins Hate.&quot; So let&#x27;s see what we can come up with.

 I&#x27;ve picked up obsidian and giving that a go. Tried onenote but hated the free following canvas, especially for text...
 So what notes do you actually take? I read in a few post people going as far as noting down every google.?.? What do you actually keep in your knowledge bases? How much detail? Can any one point me at any decent examples or templates???
 Tried keeping notes a few times but its never lasted long as it&#x27;s never felt useful... So want to pick up so better habits!!

                              <span>Once 1 node is down, most of the vDisks degraded. Degraded vDisks lot of time cause VM issue, like fail to boot up, stopped, etc. I thought, even 1 out of 4 node is down, all VMs would still run perfectly normal. We are using Microsoft S2D for storage. Any thought?? We need more than 4 node for cluster?

                              <span>We have an Azure App in azure and my boss has tasked me with coming up with a disaster recovery strategy for our Azure App. The App is stored in a specific resource group in Azure and Ive recently imported all of the resources in Terraform.
 ​
 I was thinking of leveraging Terraform as the 1st part of the DR strategy because Terraform will setup and configure all resources. The remaining hurdle is the actual data for databases and storage accounts. 
 Has anyone else built a DR strategy using this approach and would you recommend it? Are there in &quot;gotchas&quot; with this approach? Or what other alternatives are a better option.

                              <span>Hi,
 My organization is trying to establish better security policies and one of our issues is the visitation of consultants. We give them limited access on our network, but one thing I’m curious about is direct IP printing. 
 I feel uneasy about granting those users direct IP printing abilities as I don’t manage their devices. 
 From your experience, what are the risks of direct IP printing from folks outside of your organization?

                              <span>I have several old HDDs that have had company information on them. I plan on throwing the disks away as they are old.
 I have quick formatted them in Windows but I found that I can use Mac Disk Utility secure erase with several passes on the drives.
 I was wondering if there is any need to use a tool like DBAN to wipe them, or is secure erase good enough on the Mac? I have an external HDD reader so that lets me wipe the drives on any of my Mac or Windows systems. Or maybe just a hammer and drill could be used and no software wipe at all, thought on this?

                              <span>The only IT employee quit a day after I was hired, just long enough to provide credentials to everything. I&#x27;ve been taking inventory, and the products we have issued out + new in box (about three dozen units) isn&#x27;t matching up with how many were purchased on their respective websites.
 1) The highest tier warranty was purchased. 2) Computrace was not purchased or used on any device. 3) All devices have vPro. 4) We don&#x27;t use a volume license; everything is OEM image that&#x27;s been removed of some preinstalled programs, then GPO when joined to the domain. 5) How would I check to see if any Out Of Band management was used?
 I&#x27;m not looking to get anyone in trouble. Just want to cover my ass. Even something like a &quot;last powered on&quot; date would be helpful. It&#x27;s also possible that these are still in service somewhere, maybe even off the domain and/or without network connectivity. 
 Thanks for any help.
 EDIT: I have used almost every method mentioned here thus far, to no avail. I&#x27;m specifically looking for tools that Lenovo or Dell may have. To be bluntly clear, I am trying to locate about 9 devices that were purchased, with an order and serial number associated to the devices, but are nowhere to be found. Only 2 of 9 of these devices were once domain-joined computers. So, I&#x27;m suspecting 7 of these devices have possibly been stolen, and I need some way to cover my ass. It&#x27;s a smallish company and HR hates me as it is.

                              <span>This morning I migrated our UPD setup to FSLogix, but upon testing it created a VHD in the profile folder instead of using the migrated VHDX. I&#x27;m not seeing where to configure FSLogix to use VHDX and the documentation I&#x27;ve read doesn&#x27;t seem to mention it either, it only references VHD(X) everywhere.
 Am I missing something?

                              <span>I&#x27;m just wondering what everyone is using for generating passwords these days. 
 I&#x27;ve been trying a few sites and now mostly using https://passwords-generator.org as I found it to be pretty good. 
 Would love to hear what others are using.

We have made sure that our DKIM, SPF and DMARC has been correctly set up and I have even opened a ticket for a delisting however it was stated “the following IP space, not eligible for delisting”.
 We have not been able to progress as a company due to this and we have no other choice but to seek advice on what to do and how this issue could be resolved. Any help would be much appreciated.

 Should we create a proxy for it, ie: browser https request -&gt; proxy -&gt; server TLSv1 ?
 If so, I don&#x27;t know where to start or how to create that proxy is there any good guide or reference?

                              <span>This is probably a dumb question, but I am really confused by ZTNA. I know ZTNA stands for Zero Trust Network Architecture, but I was under the impression that it was a philosophy/goal not an actual software or product. 
 With that said, I am really confused as to what these ZTNA softwares actually do? How is Sophos ZTNA or FortiClient ZTNA any different from a normal VPN? How is ZTNA firewall any different from a normal one?
 I have been wondering this for a while because I keep seeing software companies coming out with there own ZTNA specific products, yet I don’t understand the difference.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve noticed that with many of the Cisco configurations you have the option to choose between setting a physical interface or an IP address when configuring certain functionality. 
 For example, when creating a GRE tunnel you can set the tunnel source as the interface number or you can use an IP address. 
 What are the pros and cons of each?

                              <span>Do live streaming services like Twitch, YouTube (when live), etc. use IP multicasting on at least part of the path from the server to the viewers?
 Or is there an individual connection for each viewer, that carries the same data?
 It would seem very inefficient, because the same data would be transferred many times over some internet backbones, to go to all the viewers in some area.

                              <span>Hey Team,
 How do you guys describe your role as a network engineer to non-technical folks?
 I&#x27;ve gotten into the habit of just saying I work in &quot;IT&quot; to describe what I do for a living to everyone. But this past week, I was recently hired on as a Sr. Network Engineer for this new company and attended a group onboard meeting. It was just me, a new exec, and the HR person.
 We were asked to describe our roles, and I said &quot;IT&quot; work. Without missing a beat, the exec took out his phone, immediately handed it to me, and asked me to tshoot why it was so slow.
 I half-jokingly said that they&#x27;ll need a ticket before I can do any type of work and expanded that I will be leading the team on the transition, design, and implementation of new acquisition networks, implementing security policies, and datacenter/cloud work. Connectivity. HR lady jumps in and says I fix the WiFi and VPN.
 Later that day, I was out celebrating with friends and met someone new who asked me what I do for a living. I jokingly responded network engineer, I fix WiFi and VPN. My partner got upset and asked why I degrade myself...
 Interested in hearing what you guys say when this question pops up.

                              <span>I built a system that looks for vulnerabilities according to CISA standards without an agent... basically to give a list of discovery ability and patching requirements around NVD. I have it setup now that it works with Captive portal and network joins that you can get device information and vulnerability information on network join. Works really cool for IoT type devices that can join WPA3 or 802.1x networks. 
 However, I want to add another feature that I think would be cool. Which is detecting the network layer ones using SNMP messages. So I wanted to know if anyone had a cool place to get a bunch of dumps of SNMP traffic or the raw models that the vendors use.

                              <span>I would like to measure latency and jitter for my DUT. There are two pairs of ports on my testing equipment. Can I put traffic load on all ports (snake test) except for two ports, and then check latency and jitter of the left pair of ports on DUT by another pair of testing ports?
 To measure latency and jitter for all ports, repeat this procedure for each pair of DUT&#x27;s port.
 Do you think this test is OK for a telecom customer to see?

                              <span>I am developing an educational software.
 I need to create a lab environment for each user.
 Users will be able to open a specially created linux machine with novnc and manage it through the browser. By running vulnerable machines in a lab environment, isolated machines and networks must be created for each user.
 If the user wants to scan the vulnerable target machines isolated for him using his own physical computer, he will be able to access it with VPN.
 If he does not want to use VPN and physical computer, he will be able to reach target machines with novnc.
 All they need to do is press a button.
 I tried using proxmox, openvpn, pfsense for this, I tried to create vlans for each user, but I thought it would be inefficient and difficult.
 I am currently researching cloud management software in the style of cloudstack, how do you think I can do this?

                              <span>Trying to access the control panel for a Ricoh MP C4504 and the page seems to hang - Win Server 2019, edge 108.0.1462.46 (Official build) (64-bit)
 Same page loads fine if I use an older version of Edge on a server 2012r2 device running edge 108.0.1462.46 (Official build) (64-bit)
 The pages used to load fine on the 2019 server and all the servers in same subnet.
 Trying in IE mode does not improve the situation, nor does using an inPrivate window
 Any ideas what else I can try?
 ​
 EDIT: Servers are all VMs, when i try from a 2019 host it works fine.
 EDIT 2: If I use a portable edition of Firefox on the Print server VM, it also works fine.

                              <span>Had a fun 48 hours. Noticed one of my scheduled backups failed and took a look at our NAS (backups for offline storage) and one of the drives was down on our raid 6. Also noticed a fan was down in the logs in the idrac. 
 Okay, put in a service ticket as it&#x27;s under warranty. Go home and think nothing of it. 
 2nd shift tech shoots me a message in the middle of the night that he noticed something revving up in our DC but couldn&#x27;t pinpoint it - then goes home. While everyone is sleeping the idrac shuts the NAS down on it&#x27;s own overnight. I come in next day, can&#x27;t remote into it so I find out it is offline, then plug in a crash cart. All the volumes showing as foreign and the config is gone.
 OK - little worried. Check the idrac and see all the volumes disconnected from the raid controller. Bump up the escalation on the service ticket and engineer comes out within a few hours. 
 We replace 1x drive, 2x fans. Bright orange dell fans were now black and a little melty. Forced to acknowledge all the volumes as foreign and reload the config. Thankfully everything boots as it should and that knot in my stomach releases a bit.
 Apparently if you lose 2 of 5 fans, the unit shuts itself down to protect from heat damage. The more you knowwww!
 Not sure why the config was wiped other than perhaps the shutdown was not the most graceful.

                              <span>Yesterday I asked a question about changing local GPOs via powershell, I got some responses but none of them worked. I found my solution and it was from surprise surprise Microsoft. LGPO is a command line program that lets you dump the current LOCAL not domain GPO to a text file then convert it back to a policy and import it. Working with it via powershell is a bit clunky, you need to do use Start-Process with CMD as admin to do anything but it works! Just thought I’d give an update.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for assistance. A number of years ago I got a card deck from a vendor at a conference that basically played out DR scenarios and I gave it away. Now I&#x27;m trying to remember what it was called and who produced it, and ideally find a copy. It&#x27;s somewhat like &quot;Cards Against Downtime&quot; from PRTG, but not quite. Does this ring a bell for anyone? Thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 This maybe a little off topic, so feel free to say i should post it elsewhere.
 I am trying to help out a charity with their mess of a computer system, they currently access their emails via Gmail Workspace and some of these mailbox’s are large at over 15GB.
 They have got Microsoft Business 365 Premium for free as they are a nonprofit and they want to move everything over to Microsoft.
 This is not something I have done before and I&#x27;m hoping will be something useful for me to learn more about.
 So I believe from the Microsoft Admin Centre I can migrate the emails across from Gmail into Microsoft and then the DNS servers will just need to be changed from the current Gmail ones to the Microsoft DNS servers? 
 Then set up the desktop Outlook app to connect to the new Exchange server 
 I found this guide for the migration here - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mailbox-migration/migrating-imap-mailboxes/migrate-g-suite-mailboxes but I am a little concerned about relying on Google and MS to talk to each other properly and do the import correctly. My original idea was to just drag all the emails from their Google Workspace into a local pst file on Outlook desktop app then after changing over to M365 to copy them back across. More labour intensive but safer?
 Also if I do the migration for a 15GB mailbox I expect that to take several hours and theres a good chance emails will be received during that time so what happens to them?
 Have I missed anything out?
 One thing that does concern me is that at the top of that page it says &quot;Effective from December 2022, the classic Exchange Admin Center will be deprecated for worldwide customers. Microsoft recommends using the new Exchange Admin Center, if not already doing so. &quot;
 The further down in step 5 it says &quot;IMAP migration is not available for new EAC. &quot; 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello all, I&#x27;m working on some FileShare permissions as a cleanup project; by default, our permissions are applied to a top-level file share folder. Different permissions may be applied to a subfolder no more than one level below the top-level file share. 
 We are actively trying to enforce that any other folder permissions needed which don’t fit this model should use a separate subfolder under the top-level file share folder (i.e., \Server1\Accounting\CustomFolder ). 
 I&#x27;m trying to tackle this with PowerShell and the NTFSSecurity module if we have a &quot;Read Only Group&quot; and a &quot;Read Write AD group&quot; applied in the ACLs. I want to get the AD RO or RW group members and see if they are in any folders deep than that to clean it up. 
 Example: Share1/Dept/Folder1/Folder2/Folder3 If Joe Doe is already in an AD group at the Dept folder and then some admin added him directly to Folder3, I&#x27;ll like to have a report showing that.
 I&#x27;ve been doing PS for around six months now, I can do one-liners pretty well, but I need help to write scripts. I would appreciate any guidance you can give me, and if I asked a stupid question or worded it poorly, please let me know! Some of the scripts I&#x27;ve been using are: 
 $notInherited &#x3D; Get-ChildItem -Path &quot;\\Server1\DeptFolder&quot; -Directory -Recurse | Get-NTFSAccess | Where-Object {!($_.IsInherited)} $notInherited | Export-Excel C:\Temp\Spreadsheets\Data_NotInherited.xlsx -TableName Permissions -AutoSize

                              <span>Any solutions for hybrid ad computers to report to non line of site without always up vpn? Our user base just doesn’t have a large vpn adoption rate due to the saas profile we have. We are still in a state of hybrid ad so this is becoming a issue when people return to office and try to connect to wifi via radius and then deal with local password cache issues.

 Or ask the user for a business justification and tell them it was the result of approvers cleaning up permissions and that it may have been and accident?
 These tickets are usually the result of terminations or compliance stuff and while we have been getting a bunch of tickets to remove people - I haven&#x27;t gotten any for this specific repository the user is trying to access - didn&#x27;t expect a ticket like this lol. Team lead didn&#x27;t answer me yesterday when I asked him so thought I&#x27;d ask here

 300 users\Pcs with no centralised user management (AD or equivalent).
 All devices were bought from consumer bricks and Mortor stores (Windows Home), endless dlink 8 port daisy chained switches in each room (one port per room) throughout the building.
 Wifi APs, from multiple, Vendors - all configured independently.
 Coding Team storing critical data to a 10 year old NAS (RAID 0) that wasn&#x27;t backed up.
 Office Home licences - 1 licence applied to 5 Pcs - so 60 Office home licences bought on Company credit card.
 Anti Virus was whatever was available for free.
 The poor, over worked, Firewall had a desk fan permanently on beside it to keep it from overheating.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had a couple interview for Network admin or Sysadmin but most of them just go over basic level security or just ask about your other roles and do scenarios like &quot;if meet with this how would you approach it?&quot;
 It kills me because I&#x27;ll spend time reading up on technical info just to refresh my mind and then I get with a question like &quot;what leadership style are you?&quot; or &quot;how do you deal with a disagreement&quot; granted they are good questions but they never good past that or just cover the basics. 
 I&#x27;ve thought about if maybe they&#x27;ve determined based off of my initial answers (which are pretty good and I go into good detail) they think it&#x27;s not even worth asking the rest?
 Anyone go through this as well?

                              <span>I have been apart of this sub for almost 6 months now and I have seen a large majority of posts saying they hate this profession . Is it really that bad? Are there any good parts of the job? I’m wondering because I am on the path of cyber security and was trying to figure out if I wanted to go system administrator or network administrator . I personally prefer software and systems over networks, but not if it’s as bad as everyone says.

                              <span>Hi guys I just got a new job and they wanted me to purchase a Windows server 2019 machine to be used as a file server running alongside of their current server which is a Windows server 2003 machine which is controlling their DNS and domain/domain controller and a few shared drives. I was able to install and set up the machine and share the drives that they wanted to be shared but I&#x27;m unable to allow users to enter their credentials to connect. Currently the only way it works for me is if it&#x27;s passwordless, otherwise anytime anyone tries to connect it says that they&#x27;re not authorized to do so. I figured I could solve this by adding the server 2019 machine to their domain but so far I haven&#x27;t had any luck. I keep getting an error saying it found the DNS but can&#x27;t connect. Can anyone help me out please? I&#x27;ll edit this with the exact errors soon I&#x27;m heading in to the office now

                              <span>Hey r/sysadmin,
 I remember seeing some posts on here a while back about using script servers for running powershell scripts, but I&#x27;m struggling to find it. 
 Does anyone know where the link is and/or have good suggestions for server software (for running powershell scripts)? We typically use scheduled tasks, but I think pitching the idea of a script server would be good.
 Many thanks!

                              <span>Hi guys, I&#x27;ve been tasked with setting up a webcam that can view a white board. The problem is there isn&#x27;t a good solution in this conference room. I&#x27;m not sure if I can include a picture, so bear with me.
 It&#x27;s a square room.
 Left wall &#x3D; entire whiteboard
 Front wall &#x3D; TV screen, windows PC, standard webcam
 Right Wall &#x3D; nothing
 Back wall &#x3D; glass and door to leave
 The webcam on the TV can&#x27;t be turned to see the white board because of the sharp angle. It seems the only solution is to get a camera on the right wall (something with double sided tape or some way to stay near the ceiling and out of sight.
 I tried putting a small tripod with an OSBOT on the center table, but they weren&#x27;t happy with how it looked.
 https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B08NPGNMV8/ref&#x3D;ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie&#x3D;UTF8&amp;psc&#x3D;1
 Any suggestions of a camera I could somehow attach to the wall on the right side? The room is probably 15 feet x 15 feet. The cables will be tricky to pass all the way up there, but something that can have a good angle, possibly a zoom if the whiteboard isn&#x27;t visible enough.
 We use the free version of discord and other meeting software, they only show 720p so I don&#x27;t need a fancy 4k solution.
 Thanks for any advice if you guys have gone through this setup.

                              <span>I am trying to get a detection script to see if the system time on a Windows client is wrong so I can remediate it with a force resync but the only thing I&#x27;m finding so far is a group of like 5 powershell modules I would have to include from TechStronghold. Is there an easier way to just compare the time between our local NTP server with a self-contained and simple detection script that anyone knows of?

                              <span>Hello,
 We have Proofpoint as our primary spam filter with Exchange online. Lately, more and more phishing and spam emails have been getting through Proofpoint and every time we get a &quot;Phish delivered due to an ETR override&quot; alert from Microsoft. This seems to be an alert policy only.
 I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to not only alert us with this ETR email, but automatically move any mail that hits that notification policy to the users Junk box? Right now, it notifies us and sends it to the users inbox.
 Thank you!

                              <span>I am developing an educational software.
 I need to create a lab environment for each user.
 Users will be able to open a specially created linux machine with novnc and manage it through the browser. By running vulnerable machines in a lab environment, isolated machines and networks must be created for each user.
 If the user wants to scan the vulnerable target machines isolated for him using his own physical computer, he will be able to access it with VPN.
 If he does not want to use VPN and physical computer, he will be able to reach target machines with novnc.
 All they need to do is press a button.
 I tried using proxmox, openvpn, pfsense for this, I tried to create vlans for each user, but I thought it would be inefficient and difficult.
 I am currently researching cloud management software in the style of cloudstack, how do you think I can do this?

 I have a python script that I&#x27;m running on a single node at the minute. I&#x27;m looking to hire a server farm to process data using the script to speed the process up as the data is taking over 1 week to run on a single node. 
 Looking for something that I can easily get started with. 
 I could use autoscaling in AWS with user data or lambda but it&#x27;s too expensive.
 I had a search but found it very difficult to get much other than farming simulator for &#x27;Server farm hire&#x27;.

                              <span>This post is directly copied from r/ITManagers (albeit with some added bits). I was advised to post this on this subreddit
 So our DHCP pool is full pretty often. A lot of users are using laptops. When they connect their laptop to a cable, their WiFi is still connected. Because of this, a lot of users are using two IP addresses while only one is needed.
 I found some solutions. A Powershell script and a GPO policy that makes it so that an established LAN connection will disable the WiFi connection. However, I don&#x27;t think this cancels the IP Lease that the WiFi connection has. Is there a way to make the WiFi disable AND the leased WiFi IP to be released again?
 The GPO solution would be the best, as we wouldn&#x27;t have to do this on every pc individually. I found the following policy: Computer Configuration -&gt; Policies -&gt;Administrative Templates -&gt; Network -&gt;Windows Connection Manager &gt; Minimize the number of simultaneous connections to the Internet or a Windows&quot;. I am not sure if this also releases the IP-lease of the WiFi connection from the DHCP pool. If not, this wouldn&#x27;t work as a solution as well.
 I like to add that I am just a helpdesk support Employee. I am guessing a lot of people will say that we shouldn&#x27;t have LAN and DHCP in the same IP Range. Though you are probably right, I am Sadly not in a position to change this.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi guys, wondering if someone has experience with this specific issue, I had to restore 2 DCs from backup from a datastore, this has obviously broken replication / AD DS etc. I have tried various checks and repairs in powershell but I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m getting anywhere meaningful. Any pro tips on what to look for or any better tools?

                              <span>Hi,
 On an Intel NUC used as a terminal to use RDS a user has a lot of déconnections.
 I ping - t and noticed that TTL alternates between 60 for a while then 251 for a while, again and again. When TTL is 251 connection is lost but ping still responds.
 I made a tracert, worked in 5 hops. I ping -t the five hops (the fifth is the destination) and the first is at TTL 255, the second 254, etc. So the destination is 251 and it makes sense but it always alternates between 251 and 60. In both case, the hop before maintains TTL 252.
 How do I intepretate that? (I&#x27;m a young tech sry if the answer is easy)

                              <span>2+ years ago I was a sysadmin for two schools, a primary and a secondary school. 
 I was paid about 65K and was not full time and I did this for about 6 years. I loved working with other people in the school every day and just being in the place daily. 
 Towards the end of my time there, I started asking for better pay and benefits like full time and a permanent role.
 Promises were made and not kept for months and months. Simultaneously, another job had cropped up in the region for sysadmin work in a team environment for several schools wherein you were given a company car and would drive around to support them. It is a subscription model.
 I was one of the first people on this brand new support team in my city. I applied and won and was paid 75K, full time.

                              <span>Hi to everyone,
 Next year I will quit my work as system and network administrator and I plan to travel the world for a year. 
 Does someone know where to find &quot;remote/freelance&quot; job offers or has already experience with this situation. 
 I am still undecided how and whether I want to work at all. On one side I would be happy to have an income to cover my expenses a little. On the other side I dont know if it would limit me too much in my plans.
 I cannot be sure to be always available (internet connection in rural areas all over the world?) and the time differences would also cause problem. Of course, I also want to do and see as much as possible during my trip. To work would also mean a daily loss of time. 
 It is not about the money. I don&#x27;t necessarily have to work to be able to afford the trip. However, it would be helpful.
 I could imagine working a few hours a day as 1st Level remote support. But I&#x27;m not even sure if I should. 
 Do you think it makes sense to look for a job in IT at all, or are other fields of work better suited. For example, as a sales agent. However, I have no experience in this or other sectors. 
 Background:
 Working in IT for more then 10 years. More or less fluent in 3 languages. 
 3 years first and second level support with basic tasks. (mostly onsite computer repairs, helping on user requests with office etc, some network and server administration)
 Afterwards in a small industrial company where my colleagues and I have been responsable for &quot;everything computer related&quot;. From Backup, Network, Mailing, Virtualization, Software, Hardware, Printers, Mobile Devices, Security and so on. 
 I would say I have deep knowledge of most areas a normal company uses, so I would not need to much training in something &quot;easy&quot;. 
 ​
 But as I already said I am unsure if this would even fit me. 
 Let me hear what you guys think about my thoughts.

                              <span>Apparently, creating a user in Active Directory is the &quot;wrong way&quot; to do it, and it should be done using Dashboard (a.k.a. WSE). Are the two not just different methods by which new users can be created? Admittedly, Dashboard gives you different options through the process, but is it definitively the right way and AD should never be utilised? My &#x27;educator&#x27; tells me Dashboard is Microsoft&#x27;s preferred method and should therefore only ever be used, but I disagree using AD is &quot;wrong&quot;, per se.

 At first I blacklisted his first address, and the next day when the second email arrived I made a new mail flow rule to block his name (only part of the addres which has not changed
 The rule is enabled, Enforced, applies if the sender&#x27;s address contains &quot;hisname&quot; and deletes the mail without notifying anyone. 
 I already had a rule like this for specific commercial addresses which managed to bypass our spam filtering and as far as I can tell those work just fine. 
 Other rules set to look for specific strings seem to work too, stuff like subject contains &quot;BTC wallet&quot; and so on, but not this one for some reason. Any ideas ?

I wanted to know if I added a large SSD to the backup server which can be used as the staging folder would help this. I&#x27;m confident the network speed is sufficient but rather hindered by the mechanical disk speed.

                              <span>Hello!
 A third party is going to upgrade a software and they have asked me to upgrade two instances from SQL Server 2012 -&gt; 2019.
 I am not very experienced with MS SQL.
 From what I have seen there are two options:
  
Use the in-house upgrade in the setup.exe for SQL 2019
 Disable the SQL-service, management studio -&gt; backup, install the new instances on 2019 and restore the backups
  
I do however have a couple of questions:
 Is even 1. worth trying? It&#x27;s very small databases.
 I assume I cannot recreate them with the same names, I have to delete the 2012 before creating the 2019&#x27;s which leaves me without anything to fall back to?
 Is there anything else I have to keep in mind?
 What is the go-to way to do this as painless and efficient as possible?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I honest rarely post online, but I would love to hear your thoughts about this as I&#x27;m honestly a bit confused and don&#x27;t know what to do.
 I&#x27;m currently transitioning to a new company (corporate), the company has been around for nearly 20 years now. The salary is good, and you know the usual 9-5 job, I decided to give my notice to my current employer to join this company.
 Mid my notice period, a startup company that is funded and supported has offered me a position, the salary is the same as the one I received from company I&#x27;m moving into, although the base salary itself is higher by around $500/month, since they don&#x27;t have the same benefits as that company, they decided to pump my base salary in order to match the offer that I received from the big company.
 Overall, both companies offered me the same salary, although the big company got more now such as bonuses, among other benefits.
 The startup does not have any benefits beside the monthly salary as they are pretty new right now, I asked them about bonuses, and they said its planned but not yet confirmed as they&#x27;ve just started. They also do not provide equity, and they could not provide me with an answer if they plan on giving equity or not.
 I&#x27;m honestly pretty confused right now on what to pick, I was gonna pick the startup as I bet it would be more relaxed (in terms of environment not work), but if i&#x27;m taking a high risk, what&#x27;s the high reward exactly if there is no equity provided ?
 Sorry for my bad English, please let me know your thoughts about this :(

                              <span>I have read some of the beta release notes of this Edge 109. The following is written there:
  
In Microsoft Edge version 110, the certificate trust list and the certificate verifier will be decoupled from the host operating system’s root store. Instead, the default certificate trust list and the certificate verifier will be provided by and shipped with the browser.
  
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-cert-verification
 There is a policy to still use the system store, but it is removed within the version 111.
 I don&#x27;t like it, but I might be wrong. Just wanted to let you know - in case you didn&#x27;t hear it.
 ​
 Edit: Maybe I misunderstood the information. It is also written:
  
In addition to trusting the built-in roots that ship with Microsoft Edge, the browser will also query the underlying platform for—and trust—locally installed roots that users and/or enterprises installed.
  
I missed that out. Sorry for the inconveniences.

                              <span>So a little backstory...
 Primary DNS server kicked the bucket a couple of months back (that was a fun day). I then changed the DHCP server to point clients to use the secondary DNS server as the primary, and use the Sophos UTM as the secondary DNS server. 
 Jump to last week... Sophos UTM gets pulled and replaced with a Fortigate 80F (I am in love). 
 Jump to this week... I am slowly adding Security Profiles to the Fortigate and making sure that Directors can access YouTube Music and the lowly staff are left with only Spotify. Yesterday it all went to shit (always happens when its a WFH day) and I have users bitching that Teams images are not loading, that attachments in Outlook Web are not loading, and that websites need to be refreshed just to get them to load (That last one got told to me this morning... and thats when I threw my fists up in the air and screamed &quot;F U DNS!!!&quot;
 Changed the DHCP settings, threw ipconfig /release and /renew at a couple of clients to test and you bet your android bottom it worked! 
 I am going to now abuse my internet freedom and watch YouTube videos while I cry into my coffee. 
 By the way... if you have not tried Fortigate then you really should!

                              <span>How are you guys managing permissions/accounts on Windows servers in a DMZ segment?
 Right now, every server in my DMZ is treated as a stand alone (non-domain) server. No LDAP/domain authentication through the firewall. Responsible parties get local accounts on each server they use. As we place more services (&amp; servers) in the DMZ we are starting to struggle to manage them in terms of permissions, accounts, &amp; lack of group policy.
 We&#x27;re considering setting up a DMZ domain. Allowing trusts with our internal domains (or not). Or even allowing LDAP &amp; needed things through the firewall &amp; adding them to our internal domain (but this doesn&#x27;t sound smart).
 What are the common ways you guys are tackling this?

                              <span>if media is overwritable (retention period expired), do you remove that media from library and insert new one? For example library takes 40 tapes and I have 160 available (60 tapes are reserved for offsite backup). If one of 40 is full and after retention, I&#x27;d pull it out and insert new one from 160/100 pool.
 
how many overwrites do you allow before you perform full erase?
 
I am seeing soft write/read errors in my backup software. It&#x27;s not too much (from 5 to 20). Tbh I didn&#x27;t notice it in previous HW setup (old library was HP, new one is IBM, backup SW is the same only higher version). I am trying to keep firmware and drivers in latest versions. All 200 LTO7 tapes were full erased before first usage in backup SW.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I have recently been tasked with improving the file storage at work and I am not sure how. We are a small business with &lt;10 employees and deal primarily with cad files, excel files, and just pdfs. Currently, we store everything on hard drives( yes, very old fashioned) and this is not working out. Overall, we have around 1tb of data, with the largest files being around 1gb. I would like to be able to store this information in one central place, yet grant different people access to certain folders. Sharing and collaborating on documents isn’t a huge focus, yet would be nice to have. We mostly just need a good storage solution that we can access from any computer. A lot of the things we work with are proprietary so security is important to us. What do you all recommend? I’ve looked into one drive for business And share point, azure files, NAS…

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m looking to learn more about colocation and networking in the data center environment. Essentially, I have a few servers that I want to put into a rack in a data center but I&#x27;m tossed up on what direction I should start with.
 The first topic is the choice of networking equipment. The data center provides a 1 Gbps SFP connection. Now, I could plug that directly into a switch and have a server in the rack that handles DHCP, but are there any good cheap switches that have a DHCP server built in that also allows for easy remote management? 
 The first setup I was looking at using was a Ubiquiti Dream Machine SE and a Ubiquti Pro switch. I would plug the SFP from the data center into the Dream Machine, then another SFP from the Dream Machine into the Pro Switch. Ubiquiti was a choice due to the familiarity of knowing how to manage the settings on both devices.
 The second setup was looking into Cisco Meraki devices, however, I&#x27;m not familiar with Cisco&#x27;s product lineup. I do have my CompTIA A+ and Network+, so I am somewhat familiar with using the CLI, but the program I was in only had us focus on managing Cisco devices on a LAN through the CLI only. I was scrolling through threads on WHT and several times Cisco Meraki devices came up. Does anyone know if Cisco Meraki devices have a built in DHCP server? If not, then I would still need to have a DHCP server setup in the rack.
 Also, does anyone have any recommendations on material that I can use to help better understand networking concepts and practices in the data center regarding how to setup and manage BGP, how to assign IPv4 subnets to specific devices, or personal advice with first time colocation experiences?
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I have patch ports that are connected to something... but I don&#x27;t know what.
 If I plug my laptop into a port... what is the easiest way to determine what switch it is connected to?
 Or the opposite direction... if I know the IP and hardware address for a device, how can I find out where it is connected? 
 I basically want to be able to do the equivalent of traceroute but with device connections. I really don&#x27;t want to follow cables... it would be faster to unplug and see when the connection breaks.

                              <span>Question for you all out there. I&#x27;ve seen many companies do their hostname and domain name formatting in different ways. In the context of an ISP, there are several ways one can identify various useful elements within an FQDN. For example, I&#x27;ve seen companies name router hostnames like:
 ar1.site1.area1
 And:
 ar1-site1-area1
 And various forms with various identifying language within them. 
 I&#x27;ve seen domain portions of the FQDN done several ways too, like:
 {{hostname}}.{{network_type}}.{{state/province}}.example.com
 {{hostname}}.{{airportcode}}.{{countrycode}}.example.com
 Etc.
 My question here is: in the context of a (W)ISP with various services (internet, TV, phone), what do you guys suggest regarding naming standards when it comes to hyphens and dots, particularly in the hostname portion? Do you prefer over over the other? Why?
 What&#x27;s a naming scheme that really stuck out to you in your environment(s) as being very useful and easily let&#x27;s you identify devices just by their names? 
 Thanks in advance. :)

                              <span>I&#x27;m in the process of working through a 10G fiber installation (upgrading from 1G copper) and I&#x27;m the person who ran all the fiber in my data center. I&#x27;m not a networking person, more of a SysAdmin, so I admittedly don&#x27;t know a ton about networking equipment.
 During the cutover, one of the corporate IT network guys said there were a bunch of CRC errors on one piece of network equipment or another, and that this was causing really bad slowness. We were then instructed to replace any fiber cables shorter than 2 meters with longer ones. We had a number of 1M cables in place. Apparently (I didn&#x27;t see for myself) the errors went away after this was done. I understand that the IEEE standard says 2M minimum for SR fiber, but I thought that was mainly due to Tx levels potentially being higher than the Rx threshold and damaging the equipment.
 How does it cause CRC errors as well?

 So I am trying to get a better gauge on what I should actually expect from my NOC? Should I expect them to fully own and run all maintenance and break fix with no help? When is an escalation a good escalation?

I’m somewhat new to automation but I’ve managed to code a handful of scripts for device management, specifically cisco devices using the netmiko library. There are no passwords stored in my current scripts with the use of getpass() and I generally have my scripts strip IP addresses from a text file that I’ll either type out prior to running the script or decrypt a text file when executing the script. Username is manually prompted and entered.
 I realize this is far from ideal but has worked for me as I only use these scripts for config and show commands on an as needed basis.

                              <span>I have an issue that I am trying to fix with a little scripting/automation but I need some help with the network side. 
 Problem: 
 We have an enterprise network with 50+ sites. These sites all have SDWAN routers/Cisco switches utilizing VLANS. Most of these sites have UPS’ connected via Ethernet for monitoring purposes. I need to know which interfaces these UPS’ are connected to so we can remotely check the interfaces when issues arise with the UPS monitoring system. 
 The only information I have about these UPS’ are their IPs and what site they are at. I could possibly get the macs of all the NICs but this would take a lot more time then I would like to spend on this project. 
 Question:
 What is the fastest way to go from “I know this IP is located at this site” to “I know the interface this IP is connected directly to.”
 Thanks for your help 🙏🏻

                              <span>Hello,
 For some time now we have been experiencing an issue on the network for a while. I haven&#x27;t been able to figure it out.
 When downloading a large file (usually 500 mb or higher) the download starts strong, then slows down, coming to a complete stop eventually. I&#x27;ve tested this at the router by plugging a laptop directly into our router. The download is fine there. But from the router, it goes downstream to our ASA then to our Core Switch. I tried the download directly out of the Core Switch as well and it seems like the problem starts when I am in the internal part of the network (ASA and downstream). I have been looking into QoS as other engineers have suggested. I am the only Network Engineer and I&#x27;ve been stuck on this problem for a while now. Can anyone please provide some insight to what may be happening on our network?

                              <span>Greetings!
 Have an issue with merging two Authorization Profile on one AuthZ Policy. I&#x27;m using a custom vendor radius attribute. It&#x27;s 12356 for Fortigate, id 1, named Fortinet-Group-Name. I have created the custom RADIUS Vendor attribute with the &quot; Allow multiple instances of this attribute in a profile &quot; checkbox checked.
 Case 1) If I put multiple instances in 1 Authorization Profile and apply it to a Policy, it works.
 Case 2) If I put more than one Authorization Profile on one AuthZ policy, it does not send more than 1 instance of the attribute. I&#x27;ve tested with 2 profiles where they have one attribute instance each.
 So, the RADUIS attribute seems to allow multiple instances, but the rule will not correctly merge the two AuthZ Profiles that is put on the AuthZ policy.
 The auth report in case1 correctly shows that attributed repeated 2 times as it&#x27;s supposed to, with two different group names. In case 2 however, the authZ result still matches the two AuthZ Profiles, but in the &quot;results&quot; part in the bottom only 1 radius attribute is shown.
 I&#x27;m on ISE 2.7p7. I know there is a new patch, but can&#x27;t update until next window, and cannot find any resolved caveats in p8 docs to hint that a update would work anyway. Also, I&#x27;ve verified the two cases with pcap.
 Any help appriciated.

                              <span>Looking for best practices and opinions, what do you do. I know newer iDracs support 1gbps connections, older ones are only 100m, but do you ever use it?
 We don&#x27;t ever intend on using our iDracs for console and remote installs, simply power management and monitoring.
 Do you connect to full gigabit or do you use Ethernet switches for yours? Just curious others experiences.
 Trying to save ports on the gigabit if we&#x27;ll never use it.

                              <span>I am planning my third decade into the networking, I thought I should get some feedback from the community. I spent my first decade working for Cisco and Juniper in Bay Area (California). I was mainly involved in network protocol testing and verification, simulating large customer environments, doing proof of concepts, educating sales engineers, handling escalated customer issues etc. Along with tremendous learning, jobs were financially rewarding as well. However towards the end I started feeling that I am not spending enough time with family. This led me into my second decade of networking job, I joined a mid size organization as a senior network engineer. I have been working for this employer for over 11 years now. The job is very stable and work life balance is great. As you can imagine after working in a same job for such a long time, it can become boring. Although I am at senior level, I still need to do maintenance windows and hardware refreshes which I don&#x27;t enjoy any more. I am ready to pivot into my third decade of networking and looking for a job change. I intend to work 5-10 years before retiring. During my years at Cisco and Juniper, I worked closely with both Product Managers and Technical Marketing engineers. I think I am going to target one of this role for my future job. What you guys think? My in-depth understanding of networking products along with network automation experience could make a good candidate for TME role. Also my current work experience (running and operating a decent size network) could be a valuable asset to a Product Manager role. I would appreciate if people who have worked as TME or Product Manager can share their experiences. What are pros and cons of each role? From the compensation perspective, are these roles similar? Which one would be a better career path considering I have about 5-10 year left. I appreciate all the responses.

                              <span>Hello everyone. 30-something male switching careers and looking for advice. 
 Long story short, spent my 20s trying to impress others rather than pursue my own interests/happiness. Obtained a BSc and PhD in biological sciences but have no intention of pursuing a career in that field.
 Recently enrolled in a 2-year college networking program. Will likely be on a wait list for another year before I can start. Looking to start teaching myself now but would like some direction.
 In your opinion, what are the most important skills for future network engineers? For example, are there particular programming languages that I should become familiar with? What Linux-based environments should I familiarize myself with?
 I am currently starting with the basics. Started a few self-directed networking crash courses on Udemy. Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>Hello all,
 First, I deeply apologize for the title.
 Backstory: A customer of ours have a problem with their Cisco FPR 4210 (two firewalls in HA pair). When they tried to upgrade the FTD to a newer version, the secondary firewall failed and complained about that the RAM is malfunctioned. The customer contacted us and our helpdesk opened a TAC case and TAC did a RMA and send the customer a brand new chassi.. 
 To my question: Since the firewalls are active/standy, the customer mentioned that a part of the secondary firewall is active. So some interfaces and routing on the secondary firewall (the standby) is active. 
 Now Im trying to understand how this can be possible done. I do not see the logic by using an active/standby but at the same time using a part of the configuration in the stan…</span>

                              <span>Hey people. I have seen posts where people want to learn more about network design and architecture so I thought it would be good to start a discussion around something I&#x27;m working on now which involves a design for management of network devices and servers. The network devices are your usual suspects such as switches, routers, firewalls, and so on. I&#x27;ll just post some of my thoughts and let&#x27;s get a discussion going.
 Segmentation - Ideally you want to have your management network in a dedicated segment which is not accessible by all users. There are of course many ways of achieving this such as using VRFs or using a firewall. I tend to prefer VRFs as it offers complete logical isolation while a firewall requires the proper ruleset. With that said, even with the use of VRFs you will most l…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently begun the interview process for an enterprise SE position at Fortinet. The hiring manager certainly paints a positive picture about Fortinet and professes to be quite bullish on their future. However, before I &quot;drink the kool-aid&quot; I&#x27;d love to get off-the-record opinions from people who work for/with Fortinet.
 How do you feel about them, where they currently stand, and their future? Is this a good time for someone to be joining them as an SE?

                              <span>So one department was still using older 19 inch full screen (the square kind) monitors. There are 3 PC&#x27;s and each were using 3 monitors and they would have 1 thing open on each monitor.
 I thought I would argue a case for them to get new monitors and I was able to get two Samsung 27 inch monitors for each PC. Got them all hooked up the other day and the users on shift that day really liked the upgrade and even though they now had 2 instead of 3 monitors, the overall monitor space was a bit bigger.
 Well fast forward to today and some on shift today were complaining that now they have to resize windows and all that to get the same things on 2 screens that they had on 3 up at once.
 I found MS PowerToys that lets you set zones on the monitors to have program in. And I was playing around and for the most part yes it did work, but there were 2 programs that our users use that would not let me put into a Fancy Zone (the name of the zones). Is there some sort of hidden restriction on why a window would not go into a fancy zone?

                              <span>Hey All,
 Our business (around 40 people) would like me to implement a ticketing system, preferrably free or low cost.
 One thing they wanted was the ability for them to set their own priority on tickets (lame).
 I imagine I would need a service that provides a webpage for them to create the ticket so they could have that option, rather than sending it to an email.
 Any services like this?
 Edit: I just discovered spiceworks, completely free, allows a user portal with custom attributes so i&#x27;m sorted!

 Someone here recently posted that they got a new job, they had hired a professional resume writer, got some help with linked in, etc.
 desperately try to find that post so I can reach out to the user and see what specific services were used.
 Or if you can recommend one, I&#x27;d be grateful. Feeling pretty dejected right now, I loved this company

                              <span>The Minecraft package we use for SCCM uses an MSI for the installer and typically we would use the MSI to uninstall the product too. However Minecraft auto-updates so the GUID changes from the original to a different GUID that does not align with the uninstall string in the SCCM package. And the uninstall in Software Center fails. Is there an alternative way of uninstalling Minecraft. We are currently using v 1.18.32. Thanks.

                              <span>I want to assign reserved IPs with host entries based on circuit ID. I understand understand how to do this portion. The catch is that the lease is still assigned by MAC address, so if a device changes on a remote uni port it wont get a lease until the current one for the old device expires.
 I saw some references from around 2010 that specifying the circuit ID as the primary key for leases was going to be coming &quot;soon&quot;. I&#x27;m not able to find anything more resent, so I&#x27;m assuming it was never actually added, but I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s an obscure enough feature that I just don&#x27;t have the right search terms.

 Solo admins out there, what is your opinion on both of the options?
 I like Darktrace&#x27;s straight-to-the-point &quot;Hey this guy is watching a Colombian webhost world cup stream on his work computer&quot; warning but its also laggy as shit on my little xps13.
 I like Falcon&#x27;s information with AD domain notifications for compromised passwords and stale accounts. Also cool to see all the vulnerabilities that I get to knock off my list of items to do.
 What EDR are you guys running?

 I just started a new job and they want me to update their existing new hire powershell script to use modern authentication or oauth2 when connecting to exchange. 
 Am i right in thinking it&#x27;s just a matter of replacing this line from the script:
 - New-PSSession -ConfigurationName Microsoft.Exchange -ConnectionUri https://ps.outlook.com/powershell/
 with the the &quot;Connect-ExchangeOnline&quot; command?

                              <span>Need help from some of you rock star admins please. I have a 56TB Volume ReFS with deduplication enabled. It has been great with a dedup rate of over 60%. All was going well until the volume ran completely out of free space I&#x27;m talking it has 279K free. I use Veeam so this is a backup target.
 You can imagine what this has done. Server 2019 will not allow me to run any dedup operations on the volume, garbage collection nor scrubbing. I deleted a large 2TB file but I&#x27;m unable to recover that space. Every Powershell dedup command I attempt to run results in volume out of free space in Event Viewer.
 This is years worth of backup data so I&#x27;m hoping some of you can help me get this volume usable again.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Today I found out that the guy sitting next to me is making 11000 more a year than me. 
 I have 4 more years experience and have been with the company a year more. 
 I think it&#x27;s time for a new job.
 Edit: Thanks , folks. I have a meeting with my boss tomorrow. To see what up. I have also let everyone in my team know this guys pay, and a lot of people are mad. What Makes me mad is that in June, when I asked about it, I was told that all they could do is pay me 159 bucks more a year. Yes, a year.
 I knew it was time to look for a new job before this, but now I might just leave before I get a new job.
 Just so people know he has less experience, the same education started a year after me.

                              <span>Lots of ranting, end of year issues, bonus/compensation gripes. Let&#x27;s try something different. 
 What&#x27;s something you did at a job that you&#x27;re really proud of, or something clever you&#x27;ve done that&#x27;s made your life easier. Bonus points assigned as always for being cheap (As this will impress management) or for being adoptable by others (As knowledge sharing is always good.) 
 Example:
 I&#x27;m now using PiKVMs at every location to make deploying laptops easier. I have a Thunderbolt dock hooked to a PiKVM at every location of my company, and can zero to hero a laptop in an hour with it. The setup is nearly done with 1ft long HDMI and USB cables, and generally &quot;Just works.&quot; Saved my ass when I had COVID and was supposed to be rolling out new laptops as I could easily just say &quot;Put it in the place with the thing&quot;

 Does anyone else get this? I get these types of calls or emails like I&#x27;m supposed to have some sort of foresight when something breaks. We do monitor all mission critical stuff so yes we know when that&#x27;s not working. But something silly like your signature pad not working or your keyboard? No I don&#x27;t go around every day and check to make sure it works. They get very snippy with you on the phone and it&#x27;s just like I can&#x27;t fix it if I didn&#x27;t know about it.
 My short rant for the day, thanks for reading.

                              <span>What a weird problem to have, I&#x27;d have loved to have this at some of my previous places when it was constantly fire fighting.
 But the infrastructure really is in an immaculate state. Documentation is up to date, everything is patched. Not many tickets come through, and we&#x27;re often fighting for them amongst the team.
 It&#x27;s bizarre.. I&#x27;m not used to this. Apparently we&#x27;re in a &quot;quiet phase&quot;, but we&#x27;ll see. I&#x27;ve tried to remain disciplined and proactive by studying, reading documentation, looking for improvements in things like monitoring and logging. But I think I&#x27;m actually better in more chaotic environments. 
 Anyone else ever been in this position?

                              <span>Is WSUS the only viable method to automate Windows patching for internal servers that will not have internet access?
 I have heard that Azure has a cloud update service that can be used to patch on premises servers, but we don’t want most of our servers to have any internet access.
 Is there a method to just give individual servers internet access as a proxy for all the other servers at that site (like you would do with a WSUS server) and then use delivery optimization or branch cache at each site to distribute the updates internally rather than allowing every server to be able to access the internet?

You enter the email address and password and there&#x27;s no error it just continuously prompts to login. They can access OWA just fine. I disabled modern authentication and re-enabled basic authentication for active sync and Outlook and then the clients are able to log in. As I can find this is not supposed to be an issue with Outlook 2016 and above. 
 Anyone have any similar experiences or ideas?

What&#x27;s the easiest way of working out if the server is still being used by clients? Is it just enough to look at the last modified date of the folders? The Event Log seems to show just the replication between each DFS server.

                              <span>Hey everyone. I was looking for some opinions here. I searched for other posts similar to my situation, but I wanted to get some advice since many posts were a few years old.
 We could have better backup storage at my company. Currently, we have two sets of external drives attached to our backup system onsite, sitting in the same room on top of each other. Each set of drives hosts an independent copy of all of our backups. We are also copying a set of these backups into Azure.
 I was permitted to look into upgrading these off-brand external drive enclosures into a rack-mounted solution for Site A and then putting an offsite backup into Site B. I got a quote for a Synology system, but the fact that they&#x27;re forcing you to use their branded drives doesn&#x27;t sit well with us. Additionally, it would be about $10-12k for one of these systems - which was more than they wanted to spend on two systems.
 As I was thinking of alternatives, I remembered we have two SuperMicro servers (that we used to use as Hyper-V servers) that aren&#x27;t being used, each having 16x drive bays in them. Both have 256GB of RAM and plenty of processing power, even though they&#x27;re ~8 years old. I was thinking of loading TrueNAS Core onto these servers, loading up the bays with storage, using these as our physical backups at sites A and B, and then still copying a set into Azure. I have never used TrueNAS before, but I think it would accomplish what we need. I can also get some 18TB Iron Wolf Pro drives for $300/ea - so ultimately, the cost of this buildout would be the cost of the drives.
 Would you have any thoughts on this setup? Pros/cons? Alternatives I should look at? Our total footprint is 50TB, but we&#x27;re currently not doing Client Backups or O365 Backups, so that will be my next project - so I need room to expand.
 I appreciate any opinions.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi all. 
 On new laptops with Intel Graphics, there is an option called Power Savings Technology. It drives me insane as it is always adjusting the brightness and contrast of the display. 
 I know where to turn it off inside the Intel Graphics Command Centre, but does anyone have any experiencing automating the disabling of this option? I want it off for all laptops and I can’t trust those that deploy laptops to adjust this manually. 
 The guides and suggestions online don’t seem to work for me, ie the registry keys advised don’t exist. 
 Does anyone have any experience with this?

                              <span>Context:
 We use GSuite for emails, HP M575/577/578 MFPs for our printing and scanning needs. We have our own domain, take it as xx.com
 We have a specific account made for scan-to-email functions, xx.scanner@xx.com
 We have over 20 printers working properly with said account, sending emails of scans properly.
 A few weeks ago, we got 2 new HP M578 MFPs, so we started configuring them for use. Configurations we&#x27;re 1:1d from older printers, together with network settings according to company policy.
 Using smtp.gmail.com, port 587, TLS enabled. All tests pass, account validates, test email arrives.
 Test with an actual document (300kb in scan size according to other machines) - Nothing
 Test with a blank page - Arrives
 Test with a very basic text document - Arrives - Size is around 30kb
 This is where the weird part comes in, seems like the document size limit is 30kb for some reason. No other printers are experiencing this besides those two. Firmware versions etc all match.
 I tried different DNS settings etc as this was sometimes reported to be the issue, nothing.
 I also read about app passwords, but some places argue that that it isn&#x27;t needed for Google Workspace/Gsuite accounts and we still have no issues with the account on our older printers.
 Has anyone run into this before and has any recommendations on what else we could try?

 I&#x27;ve tried to mount ISO and install it using the source folder.
 I&#x27;ve tried to run the DISM command, but that gives me an error as well.
 I hard stuck on what to try right now. Does anyone have something that might help me on the way?

I have a separate VLAN setup and the issue is coming from the Bootfile. There is connectivity to the server, but when pulling the boot file it errors out quickly at 0kb.
 smsboot\x86\wdsmgfw.efi
 That is the file name, I have checked permissions as well as the files location. I have tried different file names as well including smsboot\x86\wdsmgfw.com &amp; smsboot\x86\pxeboot
 ​
 I am hoping it is a stupid checkmark I am forgetting somewhere, the logs are very vague as they just simply say connected, request for file, cannot open file. Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hi there guys!
 I am working quite some time now to a really nice company that offers a lot flexibility including a lot remote working and although the management would like more of us to be more often to office most people for various reasons (some are living on other cities) are ignoring it.
 This month though there was more pressure like our manager of our team asked us to choose TWO days per month that as a team will be gathering on the office and i see they are trying to establish it especially from January of the next year.
 Thats not a problem for me and its nice to see other members of the team that i dont see often , however i&#x27;d like to have the choice especially for summers that i travel a lot to my home country etc to be able to stay longer without having to be in office for just for the sake of being in office.
 So far i have to visit the office maybe even 6 months LOL
 I feel that like a step back in terms of freedom and i am afraid if they get ideas to start asking more days per month...
 I was thinking if there are ways that still i can keep avoiding the presence in office...Like just not comply fully as many other have done in various situations?
 Like maybe attend at first a few times in office but then just only attend one per month or having excuses for not being in office ?bring up health issues or anything ?

 Verified we can connect to the server and folder from a computer on the network.
 Verified we can connect to both over VPN from an Android on cellular.
 Verified SMB 2 and SMB 3 are enable on the server.
 Verified issue from multiple devices, user accounts, and destination servers.

                              <span>Hi all, so I just got a work laptop from a new job. Sent straight from Amazon by the company to my home. Windows user account uses my personal email address, not work email (of course Microsoft office account uses work email). Can it still be monitored?

My research concluded that the easiest way is to somehow interface the 3Par to a regular server and wipe the disks with something like Blancco. How would I go about connecting the 3Par System directly to a server? What connectors/cables/protocols should be used? Enterprise storage tech is pretty new to me.

                              <span>Hi, my college got hit my Lorenz ransomware. It&#x27;s been a fun week. As i&#x27;m sure many of you know, schools dont have the biggest IT budgets so we&#x27;re responding with a bare bones team.
 We have an on-prem Exchange with an Exch relay and AD sync server - i think with bidirectional sync - to our o365 tenant. 
 We have brought back our servers from backups, but havent placed the AD sync server back in prod yet because we were told that Lorenz ransomware sometimes exfiltrate your mailboxes after a ransomware incident by scraping mailboxes after reconnecting AD sync. 
 Do you have any idea how i should approach this?
 I was thinking:
 1) Use global admin in o365 to review any suspicious accounts, privileged accounts etc and identify ones which need a password reset (board isnt letting me do a ful pw global reset :/ ) 
 2) go onto on prem domain controller and do an AD review there for suspicious accounts etc
 3) when both o365 and on prem AD have been reviewed, put the AD sync back into prod but with active sync disabled
 4) then when the server appears to be working, re-enable activesync
 Is there something i&#x27;m missing?

                              <span>Hi all, in my experience I have always created primary partitions like /dev/sda1, dev/sda2 . then create PV and extend VG, now we see all 4 primary partitions are used already. I wonder what if we create dev/sda5 as extended partition and then create PV and extend VG. Anything we should worry about?

                              <span>Hello. I hope you can give me a pointer on what is happening. The setup is simple. I have a 4000GB Hdd, connected to a W10 client with a USB docking station. Disk management shows the correct size and one huge NTFS schema. Then i connect the HDD to an Ubuntu Client to transfer some data. Ubuntu can mount NTFS and i can copy/edit my data. After moving 400gb to the client i disconnect and put the hdd back into the other docking station at my windows client. Now NTFS seems to be gone and i see 2 non allocated parts with discmanager. 1. 2048GB 2. 1678.02GB
 I guess something on the Ubuntu client isn&#x27;t liking NTFS and erase/change my partition table?

                              <span>I’ve worked quite a bit with on-prem and Azure setups but am currently planning my first Hybrid rollout. Trying to find a number on how long a device can go without having line of sight to the internal network/DC. 
 With 140ish users we have one, maybe two devices that will spend more than a day at a time away from the office (up to a month I’m told is the max) so we would like to avoid the complexities of configuring Intune and having different management protocols for these two devices but want to make sure how long they can go without checking in. They will still have internet connectivity so they are able to check in with Azure but not the internal network in our current plan. 
 Any advice is appreciated, I can’t find anything about this online and want to make sure we have everything in order before we get too deep in this project.
 Edit for clarification: right this moment these users are using local users and manually copying/emailing any files that need saved in company file shares, etc. We are working to make sure all devices are managed and users and company data are both controlled while having access to company resources when on the road.

                              <span>We had an account breach through phishing as our user confirmed the MFA request. The person then added a US phone number to the account to get persistent access. We found out pretty quickly so no harm done but I was just wondering if there&#x27;s anything we can do with that phone number. Any way to report it or is it just not worth the time?

 I did two configurations, but I can&#x27;t disable the search box from showing web results from Windows 10.
 Configuration 1 - Group policy
 I have enabled below 3 GPO but I am still able to search the web via the search box. 
 ​
 Do not allow web search
 ​
 Don&#x27;t search the web or display web results in Search
 ​
 don&#x27;t search the web or display web results in search over metered connections
 ​
 ​
 ​
 Configuration 2 - Regedit
 HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows
 - Created under Windows key and chose New &gt; Key.
 - Renamed the Key name: Explorer. Created Explorer key and selected New &gt; DWORD (32-bit) Value.
 - Renamed the key to DisableSearchBoxSuggestions. Changed the DWORD and set the value from 0 to 1. Applied and restarted the PC, but no results.
 ​
 Can anyone help me to fix this issue?

What the final policy will be regarding the use of this and other similar tools is something that will need to be discussed with Stack Overflow staff and, quite likely, here on Meta Stack Overflow.
 Overall, because the average rate of getting correct answers from ChatGPT is too low, the posting of answers created by ChatGPT is substantially harmful to the site and to users who are asking or looking for correct answers.
 The primary problem is that while the answers which ChatGPT produces have a high rate of being incorrect, they typically look like they might be good and the answers are very easy to produce. There are also many people trying out ChatGPT to create answers, without…</span>

                              <span>Hi all, 
 We have a group policy issue with our accounts. After performing the recent Cumulative Update for Win10 21H2, the user group policy is not applying. This previously worked.
 We did have RM (UK educational network software vendor) remote in and tell us some GPO changes we made were in the wrong place (GPM, rather than RMMC, the RM management software), but i&#x27;m unsure if their changes have affected it. (though i&#x27;m sure it worked before they remoted in). RM themselves are as stumped as we are.
 Inheritance looks OK, the GPOs have the right settings, but for some reason, it&#x27;s just not picking up the user GPO. The affected accounts largely seem to be legacy Roaming Profile accounts that have been converted to UEV.
 Anything i could have missed? Could there be legacy cruft affecting it? Anyone experienced the same sort of issues?
 If this is the wrong place for these sort of questions, ping me and i&#x27;ll move it :)

 On the things I should develop and work on he wrote I need to take and show an ownership of a product that was given to me temporarily after my co-worker resigned.
 ( They never hired anyone )
 End of the review “ Met Most Expectations” 
 PS! looking back at all the contributions I made for this org and the things i helped develop and design, what a waste.
 How do you guys interpret that? Thanks

The recipient should only be able to download it once and the link would also expire in a specified time frame. If there were an issue with the download they would have to re-request it from me. The file size is about 1.5 GB.
 This website (https://www.cloudfiles.io/) does all that I am asking but costs 20 a month. I&#x27;m not charging anything for the download so I would like to find a free way to do this. I&#x27;ve looked into some sort of combination of Google Drive and 7zip but nothing so far will do everything I want it to do. I do pay for a personal Google Drive account with plenty of storage. So if I can do it through google I would like to.

                              <span>Hey guys! Just recently got a new job, doing some higher level infrastructure for a company of 1600 people and 60 locations, with an IT team of 4 (me being the networking guy). I’m just starting to really grasp tunnels, VLANs and trunking concepts in a large company. I’m currently doing network discovery for these locations as they dropped their MSP last month. I worked for a msp previously but we generally supported smaller offices with pretty basic networks without switches, subnets, and VLANs. They use several VLANs across the network at my new job. They’re using fortigates and dell switches primarily. I’m trying to familiar myself with these concepts to help understand the network more.
 Now looking at the static routes on the fortigate firewalls I can see and understand how VLANs and different subnets are communicating. My question is, do you need to setup static routes on a switch with VLANs as well? I’m thinking they would have similar static routes, explaining what IP schemes can communicate over a L3 switch? Or am I overthinking this?
 Thanks for any advice! We’re a small team and sometimes I feel like I have nobody to lean on for questions like this.

                              <span>I have a pair of Nexus3K&#x27;s connecting to a varied bunch of 2960, 3650, and 3560X switches via 1000base-SX over OM4 fiber. The optics themselves were all purchased within the last couple of years and come from multiple vendors-- primarily FS.com, Approved Networks, and knock-off Cisco. Slowly over time they all seem to die at a rate about 1 or 2 a month. One day they&#x27;re fine, the next day current draw spikes and the TX drops off a cliff. The crazy thing is that I have some modules that have been in service for almost 20 years, and they work just fine.
 Anyone else experiencing this with SX SFP&#x27;s recently?

 Wondering if the TP Link CPE710 on each end would work well in this scenario?

                              <span>Good afternoon!
 The company I work for is currently running some decade-old Catalyst 2900-series switches in each of our buildings. These were configured by our previous IT admin, who is no longer with the company. I have been managing them without issue for the last few years, but it&#x27;s finally time to replace them.
 We bought 6 replacement switches (Catalyst 9200 series). 3 will be in our server-room stack, 2 in a secondary building stack, and 1 at our remote site as a standalone.
 Because I haven&#x27;t handled an install from scratch before, I was hoping someone could review my sanitized config for the standalone switch. This network is very simple, with a separate router and DHCP handled through our domain controllers.
 I reviewed this thread and tried to pick-and-choose what seemed applic…</span>

 I&#x27;ve been grinding on a VPN problem for about a day and I&#x27;m running out of steam on this one.
 I have a new Cat9300X stack running IOS-EX 17.9.1r with the HSEC and DNA Advantage license. I&#x27;m attempting to create a tunnel to AWS. This is the standard 1--&gt;2 tunnel config where there are two AWS endpoints and one customer gateway. For now, however, I&#x27;m only focusing on one tunnel. There will be BGP but that doesn&#x27;t seem to be relevant to the issue at hand.
 What I&#x27;ve got is a topology that looks like this (basically) [INTERNAL 192.168.X.X VLAN 300]-&gt;[9300X]-&gt;[VLAN200-169.254.254.1]---[Tunnel2001-169.254.165.178]--[GW FW]-----&gt;[AWS VPN Gateway 50.61.72.83]--[TunnelIP-169.254.165.177]

 I&#x27;m having difficulties with Vendor configuration files for EC120-F5, EC220-G5 and EC230-G1.
 After creating a Config file and uploading it to a new router via AginetACS, the new router gets same SSID and PIN as the device I&#x27;ve created the config with.
 I&#x27;ve read the Aginet Config Operation Manual but could not find a solution.
 Tried setting the password to &quot;?undefined?&quot; in General config and the SSID as &quot;Name_XXXX_2G&quot; (XXXX should be replaced with last symbols of each device&#x27;s MAC address, 6.2 - 6.3 in the manual). Tried uploading config straight from the router I&#x27;ve created it with and from Aginet Config Server. No luck. 
 Can anybody please help with some information on how to properly create the Vendor Configutarion Files, including Account Permission Settings and custom SSID with specific router&#x27;s PIN as wireless key, that fits any newly connected router to network? 
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got two cisco 3850 connecting two datacenters. Fiber work was scheduled for the direct connection between them so the interfaces were shut down preemptively forcing traffic the long way around on our redundant (lower bandwidth) path.
 After the work was done, i &quot;no shut: the interfaces. The interfaces lit up, but only one side could see the neighbor. Not able to ping eachother.
 The interfaces are trunks with the native vlan interface IP&#x27;d for routing protocols.
 For kicks i issued no switchport and moved the IPs to the interfaces and they came back up and are able to ping eachother.
 So somehow this issue is related to layer 2/vlans. Any ideas?
 fixed ---
 I bounced the side that was not seeing the neighbor, and everything came back up normal. Something must have flaked in that switch when i shut down those interfaces. I checked to make sure that they were in agreement as far as root bridges for vlans, but since the native vlan wasn&#x27;t coming up, both thought they were the root bridge. I&#x27;m assuming that is normal under the circumstances as they could not communicate, but the whole thing is really weird. I would&#x27;ve really liked to have found out what was causing the issue.
 Thanks for all the suggestions, folks!

                              <span>Hi all-
 As subject says; we have bad address entries in our DHCP pool. Some background:
 2 dhcp servers with failover pools (Windows Server 2022)
 Have a Cisco 4500X for layer 3 routing. This switch has dhcp helper information for each vlan
 Now, the oddities:
 -I can&#x27;t find any other dhcp server on our network of any kind, in any of the vlans
 -Only certain wired vlans are affected; the data vlans for end user PC&#x27;s. Our wireless, phone, security camera, clock and management vlans are unaffected.
 -We don&#x27;t exhaust the pool; we will get a random number of bad address entries, usually about a third of the amount of wired desktop PC&#x27;s
 -I have set the DHCP lease time to 6 hours, which results in much fewer bad address entries. If I bump it up to 2-3 days or more, I will have double or triple the amount of entries.
 ​
 I&#x27;m suspecting it might be some of our Dell desktops (optiplex 3060, Win 10 and 11 Enterprise for clients) that is the issue; in the 5 vlans affected, all of the desktops are the same model Dell. For the life of me, however, I&#x27;m not sure why this might be an issue. I have sort of a working theory, but have not tested it out yet; the desktops go to sleep at the end of the day; then are woke up by employees the next morning. They try to get their prior address, but it is listed in the scope, so they get another. 
 Anyone else ever have something similar?
 Thanks all!

                              <span>Question,
 In my environment we have layer 3 switches (cisco 3850 stacks) and they go directlly to a NGFW (fortigate) is there a need to put a router in between the switch and firewall if the firewall does the routing? Like what are the benefits.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m configuring a network between 2 sites. In order to ensure redundancy I have 2 paths between the sites with different weighted routes. These paths are tunneled between 2 routers and when the primary router tunnel goes down it takes the firewall anywhere between 30 secs to a 1:30 before switching to the alternate route. Is there anyway I can configure the asa to drop and switch routes quicker? Please let me know if I need to provide more information. Thank you!

 Cisco 2900 series is connected to another 2900 series via port 49 with a fiber cable. Got lights on both sides. NOTHING is plugged into this switch. I get an email saying their whole team when down. Just this team. I unplug the port 49 and it happens again. They all lose connection for a moment then back to network connection...Wtf?
 I&#x27;ve ssh&#x27;d into the both of the switches. The new one has a Mac address table with nothing plugged in. Just noticed the the new switch duplicated the 130 macs from the other switch.
 What the f$%k gives? Confused.

 On Monday my business had some sort of power event that caused our firewall, main switch (hp-2510-48), phone system and one of our active directory/dns servers to power cycle before coming back online. After that in a seemingly random pattern, various end point devices can no longer connect to the network, and for those devices that can, the network latency is through the roof. Before, on average packet loss would be maybe 1/100 if we were looking, now it is 40-60% packet loss. 
 Our initial investigation showed that plugging directly into …</span>

                              <span>Hi r/networking, 
 I&#x27;m relatively new to networking and have a weird circumstance that I&#x27;m not sure how to tackle. 
 I connect manufacturing equipment to our client&#x27;s WAN on a regular basis. Our manufacturing equipement has an internal LAN with the IP scheme, 192.168.100.XXX, and I use a router to NAT to static IPs on our client&#x27;s network that they provide. 
 It&#x27;s usually smooth sailing, I configure the router to the dedicated IPs the client provides and we&#x27;re good to go. 
 My trouble is my client&#x27;s WAN is 192.168.100.XXX as well. So NATing would be pointless and I cannot reserve all of IPs of my machine on their network. 
 Would there be a good way to not create conflict? My initial thought is to use a VLAN so my equipment&#x27;s LAN sees the VLAN and their WAN sees the VLAN and neither ever sees each other, I don&#x27;t actually know if this is possible or the best course of action. Any guidance is much appreciated!

                              <span>Hello!
 ​
  
What I am doing:
  
Testing platform to see disruptions and to check to see if my software can detect these.
 I am sending packets from a IP to a multicast address then to another IP.
 For example: (#1 IP)192.168.1.1 sends it to (#2 Multi)235.1.200.1 and then it goes to (#3 IP)192.168.1.15.
 I am on a external computer (Connected to same network switch). I have been trying to spoof the #1 and 2 IPs. So that the messages goes from #1 to (ME #4) then to the #2 Multi then #4.
 It doesn&#x27;t really matter the order as long as I can see a loss, delay effect on either end of the network.
 ​
  
What I need:
  
I need a way to intercept and control the flow of these packets. I need to represent a loss of packets, and delay the time which the packets send at.
 ​
  
Things I have tried:
  
I have been using Ettercap and TC Qdisc to try and make this work. I can receive the packets with Ettercap, but when I try and use TC Qdisc it doesn&#x27;t have any effect.
 I originally tested just going from IP1 to IP2 and used Ettercap to spoof these ips. I then used TC Qdisc to control the loss packets, delay, duplicate, and corruption of these packets and it Does work.
 ​
 In my original test without multicast you would see this on wireshark:
 192.168.1.1 &gt;&gt; 192.168.1.15
 192.168.1.15 &gt;&gt; 192.168.1.1
 ​
 With multicast you would see this on wireshark:
 192.168.1.1 &gt;&gt; 235.1.200.1
 192.168.1.15 &gt;&gt; 235.1.200.1
 I tired getting between the host and multi and tried applying the effects there but no luck. 
 192.168.1.15 &gt;&gt; (ME TC QDISC HOST) &gt;&gt; 235.1.200.1
 ​
  
Question to you:
  
What are my options here. If you have experience with this feel free to share your approach.
 Is there another way to go about this? If so please let me know.

 I learn they patched directly into modem because &quot;That&#x27;s the way we&#x27;ve always done it.&quot;
 anyone seen this before? Completely different WAN IP range, which is obvious but I wouldn&#x27;t expect that to work like it did.

My template changes are still deployed and I&#x27;m able to pass traffic, so they&#x27;re still working. It&#x27;s just console access that&#x27;s broken. Tried it on a bunch of different labs running different code and same thing happens on all of them. Any ideas on why I can&#x27;t console in after a restart?

                              <span>Hi Guys!
 We are working on implementing TACACS to manage admin login to client and core routers. I understand the router side configuration. But can&#x27;t seem to grasp the best practices for implementing the TACACS server itself.
 We use Ubuntu servers but as I understand tac_plus is no longer supported on Ubuntu? I came across TACAS.net is this the way to go? I have exhausted all my google queries. Any advice?

                              <span>So, I was tasked to evaluate on which devices and topologies to use on small, medium and large networks. (In my assignment) I have done the small since I know/familoar the real life small networks. I included café , restaurants, schools and small businesses as small networks and I choose to write either bus or star topology could be used. So I need help for medium and large networks. Since I don&#x27;t which real life networks are considered as medium or large. Please, I request help.

                              <span>I have a number of Cisco ASA devices that i want to upgrade the ASA/ASDM software on.
 The all run in active / standby mode.
 I have a mixture of ASA5525-X, ASA5545-X and ASA5555-X devices.
 ​
 They all run:
 Current ASA version &#x3D; 9.8(4)10
 Current ASDM &#x3D; 7.13(1)
 Current FXOS &#x3D; 2.2(2.121)
 ​
 I want to upgrade to:
 ASA latest verion &#x3D; 9.14.4
 ASDM latest version &#x3D; 7.19.1
 ​
 But what about the FXOS version - do i need to upgrade that ?
 I&#x27;m having trouble finding a clear explanation as Cisco documentation invariably points to firepower devices.
 ​
 That said i discovered the document below. 
 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/upgrade/asa-upgrade/asa-appliance-asav.html#topic_r5l_tt5_bbb
 ​
 Just to confirm i do not have a physical firepower module in any of the ASA devices.
 ​
 Is there a software file I need to download for the FXOS ?
 ​
 Any help much appreciated.

                              <span>I have a 1000$ training budget to spend by years&#x27; end. I&#x27;m looking for network automation training resources.
 What I feel I would benefit mostly from:
 -How to deploy an easy to maintain application (git, jenkins, docker), general devops stuff. I know how to use these tools in a rudimentary fashion, but I feel I don&#x27;t know how to put them all together.
 -Popular Python network automation libraries (netmiko, nornir, napalm).
 I already have access to O&#x27;reilly&#x27;s library and Linkedin Learning.
 I&#x27;ve looked at INE but they don&#x27;t have anything in the area of automation, CBT nuggets looks promising - I&#x27;m going to try their 7 day trial. ipspace.net&#x27;s Individual standard subscription also looks promising.
 What trainings in this area did you have a good experience with and you would recommend?

 I work in network security for a few years and I would love to learn more about designing networks, with of course security best practices.
 Can you please point out some good resources and/or certificates for secure network design/architect? I found TOGAF, but I feel like it&#x27;s more Project Manager or Architect focused on processes, not the network architecture itself.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi
 Can someone please help me:
 Simple Network architecture:
 https://imgur.com/a/xYzEAOU
 Cloud management subnet is 192.168.222.0 with a mask of 255.255.255.0 and the Gateway IP is 192.168.222.1 which also runs a DHCP server:
 On the eve-ng host:
 root@eve-ng:~# route
 Kernel IP routing table
 Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
 default pfsense.skubsad 0.0.0.0UG 0 0 0 pnet0
 192.168.222.0 0.0.0.0255.255.255.0 U 0 0 0 pnet0
 ​
 Steps to reproduce:
  
​ 
 Add a new Cloud Network on the topology with network type set to Management(Cloud0).
 
 2. Add a new Virtual PC (VPC) to the topology
 3. Connect VPC to Management Cloud. Start the VPC
  
Expected behavior:
 The Interface connected to Cloud 0 on the VPC should get a DHCP assignment from upstream DHCP server (1922.168.222.1).
 Observed behavior:
 No DHCP assignment on VPC interface connected to Cloud 0. However, after static assignment, I&#x27;m able to ping upstream DHCP server (192.168.222.1).
 Question:
  
Why no DHCP assignment on VPC interface connected to Cloud 0?
 After static assignment, I am able to ping the DHCP server 192.168.222.1, but it does not pick up DHCP by itself?
  
​
 Thank you in advance
 Best Regards

                              <span>I did the job-hopping, get the money, move to consulting and sales, and made the money.
 After a lot of years, the kids are grown, the bills are paid, and I&#x27;m in a place where I don&#x27;t need to make a pile of cash to be happy.
 So, I took a job at a local college. I get amazing benefits, a chance to pad my retirement, and I actually believe in what I am doing. I get up, do my best to help kids in school, then go home. The new job is literally blocks from my house.
 No more early middle of the night / early morning calls.
 No more late night bullshit. No more &quot;emergencies.&quot; If I do get called in, I walk up, then go in late the next day.
 The users? Bringing a ton of years of enterprise level-experience and customer service habits allow me to just fucking kill it here.
 I wish I could have afforded to do this before.

                              <span>Hey everyone, 
 I have a Sophos SG115 that I&#x27;ve just freshly configured and would like to connect a Sophos APX120 to the UTM but I can&#x27;t seem to get it working. I&#x27;m pretty new to Sophos, and firewalls in general, so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing something super basic. 
 As it is right now, I have the wireless AP connected to a PoE injector, and then connected to the LAN port of the SG115. The AP turns on and boots fine, but gets stuck on a flashing amber light, which according to the manual means the AP is not claimed by the wireless controller. I&#x27;m wondering if maybe I need to create a new DHCP server on the UTM? When I check the IPv4 Lease Table there&#x27;s nothing listed, so it&#x27;s clearly not picking up that the AP is connected. Or at least not assigning an IP via DHCP. 
 If anyone has any experience with this and had some tips or guidance it would be super appreciated. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I am working on a Hyper-V configuration where I need to pass multiple VLANs on the same network interface (tagged sub-interfaces).
 Within the VMWare world, this is easy. A Port group assigned to VLAN 4095.
 Within Hyper-V, I used the Powershell command:
 Set-VMNetworkAdapterVlan -VMName &quot;VM-Name&quot; -VMNetworkAdapterName &quot;DATA&quot; -NativeVlanId 0 -AllowedVlanIdList 1-4094 -trunk 
 Per my understanding, that puts the NIC into &quot;Trunk&quot; mode, allows all VLANs, and doesn&#x27;t allow a Native VLAN (so only tagged traffic will flow) - I also tried native to 1.
 Unfortunately, from a PCAP it looks like Hyper-V is stripping the 802.1q tag from the frames. So I am seeing traffic from all of the different VLANs - but without their tags. That&#x27;s not going to work...
 Is there something else that needs to be defined for Hyper-V to pass the tags not just the payload?

                              <span>So I have a physical 2019 server with a TPM that has the OS and data drives Bitlocker encrypted using TPM.
 I need to take the server off the current domain and move it to a totally different domain.
 I have Bitlocker recovery keys and will generate fresh ones before doing this but is there anything I need to consider when I do this?
 The option to allow TPM was set using GPO and when it&#x27;s taken off this domain that GPO won&#x27;t apply but the drives are already encrypted.
 I&#x27;m not 100% sure what the behavior will be when it restarts off the existing domain and I don&#x27;t have a spare physical server to try this on.
 If I have to enter the recovery key that&#x27;s OK so long as the volumes unlock :)

                              <span>Hi All,
 While not actually a blank slate, we are currently full embedded into SCCM. We are having plenty of difficulties patching third party applications and don&#x27;t have the man power to keep packaging apps.
 While we looked and trialed PatchMyPC and worked really well, a subsidiary of ours isn&#x27;t using MECM and has all their devices enrolled into Intune/Endpoint Manager. This was fine, until we went to enroll the terminal servers, which at that point realised Microsoft doesn&#x27;t support Endpoint Manager for MS Server.
 So now we are looking at RMM tools to help us with, application deployment and patching. I have come across a number of tools, and NinjaOne seems to be on top. But their pre-sales are frustrating and constantly want me to do a demo session with their techs instead of just giving me a price on the 2500 devices I want to cover.
 I checked out Gartner, but it doesn&#x27;t do quadrants for this in particular, more so unified desktop management which brings MS Endpoint Manager to the top.
 If anyone could chime in on if you had a blank slate, what would you do? Also the business will not touch SolarWinds with a 10ft pole because of the scandal last year/year before and I have heard mixed reviews on ManageEngine&#x27;s Desktop Central.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve heard a bit about ChatGPT over the last few days and finally decided to try it out.
 It&#x27;s.. Incredible at what it does. I asked it, to spin up a series of nodes in AWS with IAC, running one of the applications I support, and also implement DR for those nodes. And within seconds, I had a workable script that did exactly what I had asked it to do. 
 I&#x27;ve run it against a bunch of different scenarios and overall it seems more competent at coding than about 90% of the people I&#x27;ve worked with, myself included.
 Even vaguely querying errors returns answers better than what you&#x27;d typically receive from any vendor support over the course of days, in seconds.
 So what are the implications here - where does everyone see the field going? I honestly didn&#x27;t think we&#x27;d get to this point for another several years, minimum. I&#x27;m starting to think I might need to re-skill and move over to pure development just to stay afloat in the next few years.

The examiners are really starting to crack down on our IT management, but I don&#x27;t have the toolset to really provide much more management. They want encryption, patch management, etc....Also, improving IT/Security isn&#x27;t where the CU wants to spend their money.
 What&#x27;s the best way to learn how to harden the network itself internally? Like set up an Active Directory? Where can I sandbox some of this before trying to present it to management? Where can I learn more? If anyone has any tips or ideas, I really appreciate it as I am pretty much on my own on this. Low cost options are appreciated as I will not be reimbursed by my institution.

                              <span>Hello All,
 I am a field engineer for a large MSP. We have never had any good imaging processes. On the day to day pc replacement, we just use the dell default image, go through the oobe and install everything by hand in-person, then manage the rest with our RMM. For a re-image, we just use the media creation tool image and once again go through the oobe, join domain, install software. 
 For large scale replacements, (When win7 went EOL) we had a process where we would upgrade the PC to win10, and then use Macrium reflect to clone the PC onto a brand new PC. This was relatively quick and effective at the time, however over the last 2 years we have had constant issues with a lot of the cloned machines and ended up re-imaging most one by one. 
 I have been asking management to start doing the Dell Image Assist, where we get them from dell mostly pre-imaged, but they decline every time. 
 Well, now, one of our larger clients just had 150 new Pc&#x27;s delivered, that they need installed, and the ticket has been just dropped onto me to get it done. This would require me to unbox, complete the oobe, rename the PC, join it to the domain, install chrome, adobe reader, office 365, and their specialized software. And then on a per user basis install their respective printers, scanners, other devices. 
 Anyone have any ideas on the fastest way to get these PC&#x27;s deployed? Sysprep drive duplicating? Creating 1 image and then sysprepping and then trying to clone it out to the rest of them?

                              <span>Hey guys,
 When I was on the Service Desk, I frequently solved issues by restarting the computer. 
 At some point, I got tired of asking the user to restart the computer, or arguing with the user that they in fact haven&#x27;t restarted their computer in a month. 
 I made this script. I hope it helps someone out there. 
 I designed it so you can keep it running in Powershell and punch in the host name for a computer to check the uptime. I&#x27;m a Powershell novice. 
 do{$RemoteComputer &#x3D; read-host -prompt &#x27;Which computer are you inquiring about?&#x27; IF((Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem -ComputerName $RemoteComputer -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue).pscomputername -like $remotecomputer) {(Get-Date) - (Get-CimInstance Win32_OperatingSystem -ComputerName $RemoteComputer).LastBootupTime} else {&quot;Computer not found&quot;} } until(Read-host -prompt &#x27;Press Enter to continue...&#x27;)

 What are some of the things you wish your predecessors had or had not done to make your life easier? For instance, we have a 5 year plan in place to go to 365. I will be gone before that project even starts but what could I do to make it easier for when the time comes?

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious what other sysadmins are doing to prepare for the Windows 10 end of life and end of support in October 2025 (147 weeks) I&#x27;ve seen some &quot;never Win11&quot; discussions. 
 We are 15% Win11 now for our pilot ring, and all new deployments are Win11. No issues save one - an old VPN software from the state. No user or IT complaints so far. Some of our data is under federal regulation and cannot be on unpatched or unsupported systems so being on an unsupported OS is not an option. We have other systems and unregulated data on very old software written for Win XP that has no trouble running on Win11.
 To minimize IT support and troubleshooting and dual documentation for end users, I am hoping to make the transition quickly. Aiming for 100% in the next 12 months, but I suspect that like most of my deadlines that will slip.
 Are you testing Windows 11? What is your timeline for upgrading? Any issues?

                              <span>Sitting here at home and sipping on some gin and tonic, I had an epiphany. I made it! Not “I’m rich” made it but “I found a place where I want to be” made it. This is the first time I’ve taken time off in my new role and after 4 days I actually miss the job. Been here for about 9 months now and I can honestly say that this is where I want to work for the foreseeable future. The MSP I work for does it all right and ticks all the boxes. Good salary comp for the kind of work I do, social, perks and benefits, company culture, work life balance, useful teammates, you name it. Sure we get dickhead users and silly requests like everyone does, but somehow the way the company manages all of this make this a non-issue.
 All that corporate mumbo jumbo about culture, all the Richard Branson quotes, the LinkedIn posts that talk about stuff - this place actually does all of that, for real, and no one waffles on about it. A recruiter emailed me the other day offering an interview for a position with better working times and 25% better pay and I replies saying not interested before I read the full spec. 
 I don’t have a motivational quote or a moral lesson to finish off on, just felt like sharing. I guess what I want to say is that these places to exist, it just feels surreal.

 Dedicated Fiber and Coax both effected.
 Anyone happen to have any information?

These are big vendors like Verizon etc. Is this an issue on their end? Should I just create a policy that doesn&#x27;t SPF check messages sent through Salesforce? Or just leave them being marked as spam. Curious how others handle this. And it isn&#x27;t just Salesforce. It&#x27;s any 3-rd party, automated, mass-email system that vendors like to use to send emails on their behalf but maintain their email address in the header.

                              <span>I really hope someone can help with this one. We have a user who has left the company who had access to tons of sharepoints, most of which were created before our company was sold to another. So those sharepoints still exist but are essentially never used, except some documents we have are using macros to access old data in them. 
 I want to grant all this sharepoint access to that employee&#x27;s replacement so she can use these files normally, but for the life of me I cannot find a way to just simply list all of the sharepoint sites a user account has access to. I might be being dumb as hell but I can&#x27;t find it in 365 admin/sharepoint admin. 
 I just want to see:

                              <span>Hello sysadmins... 
 Since the November 2022 Security update when we are prompted for the &#x27;Browse for Folder&#x27; dialog on our Windows 11 machines, only &quot;Desktop&quot; is listed.
 Some forum posts have confirmed this to be a problem when using OneDrive desktop redirection but no solution or workaround other than disabling redirection or removing the update. Neither are options in our corporate environment.
 Is anyone else dealing with this and have any ideas for a solution? 
 Many Thanks!
 Windows 11 22H2 with KB5019980 installed.
 OneDrive Desktop Folder Redirection on.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I use for my core switching datacenter 4 juniper switches,
 2 EX-4600 with 24 port sfp 10G with 2 EX-4300 48 ports RJ45 1G, each 2 models are virtual chassis and connected with 4 qsfp.
 These are legacy I got and dated from 2016.
 I&#x27;m interested in replacing them with either cisco or aruba(heard some good things on arista as well).
 Would welcome advise on equivalent newer models and some general and personal experiences you had with them.
 Feel free to suggest other options or anything useful to important things to know.
 Thx in advance

                              <span>I may have screwed up a bit and need some help. Our IS team ran a Purple Knight scan against our AD environment to look for potential configuration issues. One thing they found was a high number of users that had adminCount set to 1. Their recommendation was to clear the adminCount for all standard users and see how many of them return to an adminCount of 1 the next time SDPROP runs and review the list at that time.
 I inadvertently cleared the adminCount for ALL AD objects instead of just the standard user objects. In other words, the builtin groups that are supposed to be protected were also cleared. When I realized this, I set the adminCount for those groups and 2 users (administrator and krbtgt) to adminCount&#x3D;1.
 Admittedly, my understanding of how SDPROP works could be way off but my expectation would be that when SDPROP runs, any users of those protected groups should have thier adminCount set to 1, inheritance disabled and their ACL replaced with the same permissions as what are on the AdminSDHolder object.
 However nothing is getting the adminCount set back to 1, not even domain admin group members. I don&#x27;t know how to check to make sure that SDPROP is running or not. I checked the PDC for the registry entry that controls the SDPROP frequency (HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NTDS\Parameters\AdminSDProtectFrequency) and it doesn&#x27;t exist so it should be running every hour by default. I even tried triggering SDPROP manually.
 Any ideas of what I could check next or what I might be missing? Do I need to set adminCount&#x3D;1 on the AdminSDHolder object?

 The problem is: After the next Azure AD Connect sync, the accounts are re-enabled in Azure AD. I understand the behavior, but need to prevent this somehow. 
 Do any of you have a good idea for me?

                              <span>As title suggests, I’d like to add my personal Apple ID to my work laptop but I’m obviously pretty apprehensive of the security/privacy concerns associated with doing so. My company appears to use Jamf as its Mac MDM and I haven’t fully explored to see if there are any keyloggers/spyware installed etc. However, I was just wondering what the risks are with adding my personal Apple ID to my work machine? It’s worth noting that I don’t intend to check any of the boxes in the iCloud system preference page; this would purely be for handoff features and the like and I wouldn’t synchronise any services such as iMessage, photos, iCloud Drive etc (although maybe private relay could be useful). As far as I know, to get features like universal control and unlock with Apple Watch to work you need to have both an iPad and a MacBook on the same primary Apple ID as even things like notes and reminders don’t work with a secondary Apple ID.

                              <span>What would you guys do in this situation?
 We are located in a secure facility that requires background checks for all vendors. We also have a contract with Canon copiers to service them whenever they break down or need replacing. We have a copier that is broken but our facility won&#x27;t let the techs in without the background check. Canon is not being cooperative in allowing their techs to complete the BG check. I believe the techs may not even have social security numbers which is holding things up. The facility won&#x27;t let the techs enter in without the clearance.
 I (on-site help desk) will be out starting next week for the holidays.
 I have a few options I can think of:
  
Short term, wait until tech gets cleared, but they haven&#x27;t been responsive
 Bring copier outside the facility and somehow tech can service it out on the street? This seems counter intuitive and hard to do.
 Get tools from Canon directly and fix myself?
 long term, get a smaller copier (that IT can fix) not on a contract and/or eliminate the contract with canon.
 Resign my position as the facility is preventing me from doing my job which is to coordinate these things

                              <span>I&#x27;m having some trouble finding out if this feature was implemented, last I can find is the post 2 years ago about implementing it for Partners saying it&#x27;s coming soon for B2B orgs - https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-365-blog/new-organization-switcher-in-the-microsoft-365-admin-center/ba-p/1165543
 But a video posted in 2021 to their official channel says it is &quot;rolling out&quot; for Azure B2B - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;co08qYurtzgt&#x3D;1900
 But an article updated in the last 2 months still says &quot;allows Microsoft 365 partner admins the ability to administer all the tenants they manage from a single location&quot; - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/multi-tenant/manage?view&#x3D;o365-worldwidehttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/multi-tenant/manage?view&#x3D;o365-worldwide
 To clarify, Azure AD Admin multi-org through B2B is working fine , but really need the access on the 365 Admin. I currently cannot get the Organization Switcher to show anywhere (outside of Azure AD Admin).

                              <span>I usually install office by going to office.com signing in and install office. Is the procedure different for a domain PC that will be used by multiple users? Of course each will he to sign I to office using their 365 credentials once they sign in under their domain account. 
 Am I missing anything? Every so often this PC will not let anyone sign into the Office apps and say the product is unlicensed. They all have Apps for Enterprise and Business Basic licenses.

 A developer has other needs than a knowledge worker and may need a workstation with less restrictions. I think about applocker rules etc and other security related restrictions.

However, I feel almost embarrassed to put down only one or two things on that report and don&#x27;t want them to feel like I&#x27;m doing nothing because I am working but what I&#x27;m doing takes forever. I&#x27;m trying to create onboarding and offboarding procedures (that keep changing all the time due to changes we are currently making to our system). I am trying to learn some code and create a database and other applications, which I&#x27;m sure you all know takes time too. So when my report is due, it literally has like 3-4 things on it. I also put out all the small fires or things employees need throughout the week too. Any suggestion how I can make this thing look more productive?

 I noticed a weird problem and can´t figure out how to solve it.
 We use Exchange 2016 On-Prem and this problem is only affecting this employee, no one else.
 I setup a laptop for her because she was switching to home-office for a few weeks and as soon as i wanted to start and setup outlook i got hit with an error message saying: &quot;Outlook can´t be opened&quot;. I waited a few seconds and outlook did start but it wouldn´t load any mails.
 Any Help is appreciated

As far as I know user have been using to login to PC with Microsoft account and decided to make local account, I think they tried migration because there is only local account visible at login screen. After restart login failed with message &quot;the user profile service service failed the sign-in. User is not the biggest deal but bitlocker. In order to fix User profile there is a ways to do so like using Regedit and I have done it in the past, but I can&#x27;t get to recovery CMD or safe mode because of bitlocker asking to enter key to unlock the drive. Plus, recovery key is not present in Microsoft account. Does any solution exist for this?

 I have a situation where we&#x27;re moving people across to azure only managed devices and that means their accounts don&#x27;t need to be domain joined anymore, as the only thing requiring domain authentication was the old domain joined computer log in screen.
 Initially we were moving the accounts to an unsynced organisational unit and then re-enabling the deleted accounts in azure to break the link, but we found that this had the side effect of removing their private channels on teams due to teams channels not being managed via an assigned group.
 Is there any way to pause adsync, move the on-prem account to the disabled OU, then just set the accounts on-prem sync to false on an individual account basis?

 This is the configuration I have in mind, https://www.dell.com/en-uk/shop/dell-servers-storage-networking/smart-selection-poweredge-t440-tower-server-plus/spd/poweredge-t440/pet4402a?configurationid&#x3D;78d39809-61c4-43c5-88aa-9b9fa758a475
 It will act as a print server, backup storage for less relevant data, and for some automation for our database.
 Any recommendations, or comments? I&#x27;d appreciate the advice.

                              <span>Hi Reddit, hoping you guys&amp;gals can help me.
 I&#x27;m trying to find a download of Exchange 2007 to install the management tools so we can powershell and export users to psts, but i can&#x27;t for the life of me find a download for it. Can anyone help?
 I&#x27;ve looked at bittitan as a alternative to move the users onto 365 but users budget is 0...
 All help is much appreciated!

                              <span>In our setup, we have an RDS farm running Server 2022 which is pretty heavily used. Quite often, outlook.exe, excel.exe or some other program, will end up in the IFEO key (Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options) with debug options preventing that program from starting entirely.
 I&#x27;ve yet to find any way of preventing those keys to be created, my google-fu must not be up to scratch.
 It&#x27;s only really started being an issue within the last couple of months. It happens on workstations running Windows 10 21H2 too, though rarely.
 Has anyone else had this issue? Maybe even solved it?

                              <span>Hello !
 ​
 First of all, sorry if i make gramatical/technical mistakes, English is not my first language.
 So, recently, my company started to use Azure AD for using Office 365 with a federated Domain. We set a SSO with Shibboleth linked to our main domain. Then, if a user try to connect to the domain, it redirect them on the CAS page, and if they&#x27;re already connected, allow the authentication. This was done with our network engineers, actually in charge of the OpenLDAP (one of the domain is on Samba 4 and the other only have and LDAP and no samba)
 ​
 Since then, we though of some amelioration and I was trying to log in windows with work account (so an account present in the azure A.D). It works for the account in managed domain, but doesn&#x27;t for the federated domain.
 ​
 I know it&#x27;s logical since the Windows authentication can&#x27;t redirect them to our CAS, but I read online that some people can login with federated domain username and password. My question is, how ?
 ​
 I believe the main mistake was during the first implementation of the SSO with the command Set-MsolDomainAuthentication. We used the command as :
 Set-MsolDomainAuthentication -DomainName $OurDomain -federationBrandName $FederationBrandName -LogOffUri $LogoutUrl -Authentication Federated -PassiveLogOnUri $LogonURI -SigningCertificate $certData -IssuerUri $uuri -PreferredAuthenticationProtocol SAMLP 
 We didn&#x27;t use &quot;ActiveLogonUri&quot;, but I&#x27;m not sure if this is usefull, nor really sure about what that property can do. Still, this command work for the web-based applications but obviously not for Windows authentication 
 Is this the problem or am I completly out of place ? Do you have any idea about the origin, or a solution ?
 ​

                              <span>Hi guys,
 Have a quick question regarding the above. 
 We have SPF enabled for just spf.protection.outlook.com and that’s sufficient enough I believe. So only things sent from M365 will allow outbound mail. 
 DKIM is setup via DNS and our 365 admin centre. And this seems fine. 
 But here’s where I’m a bit confused. We have dmarc enabled and it was set to quarantine. So all mail that fails SPF and DKIM will go into spam? Is this for inbound or outbound mail? I thought DMARC was for outbound, but a 3rd party trying to email us, got an error showing DNS Auth: DMARC failed.
 Is this an issue on our end?
 Tia

I’m weeks now trying not just to get the base functionality working but even to get consistent behaviour on the few endpoints in our pilot. I’ve a few contacts that ran the compliance features in their own shops and their experience of it was not encouraging. 
 Has anyone here seen MS DLP working in action ?

 I am planning to replace existing hostname by making simple interactive script
 #!/bin/bash echo &quot;Set Hostname&quot; read name1 name&#x3D;&#x27;cat /proc/sys/kernel/hostname&#x27; sed -i &#x27;s/$name/$name1/g&#x27; /etc/hostname hostname $name1 
 The issue here is - it changes hostname after I set input after script run. I exit and log back in. I see new hostname. But nothing gets changed in /etc/hostname file. reboot and I am back to old hostname.
 What am I missing here?

                              <span>Hi all,
 ​
 TLDR; Does SMS store failed files/directories in its logs?
 Having completed an inventory scan I&#x27;ve got around 300 failed folders which i can&#x27;t seem to find any reference for in the logs (obtained using the StorageMigrationServiceHelper PowerShell Module)
 I&#x27;ve tried using AccessEnum to query folders i don&#x27;t have permissions to and it comes back with Access being in place except 1 file. It also seems to only return a small fraction of items with the default or &#x27;display only files that have permissions less restrictive than parent&#x27; on
 Have ran various PowerShell scripts to query access also and around 100 items are path too long etc but this still doesn&#x27;t match the number of failed folders on D and G drives.
 Seems like i&#x27;ll end up migrating whats been inventoried so that it gets the bulk over and creates the shares (won&#x27;t be using the cutover) and then likely Robocopy the rest but id obviously rather have the SMS takes care of things for me.
 ​
 Any advice/ insights would be appreciated :)
 ​
 Cheers

                              <span>hey everyone, want to run a hypothetical. Let’s say we have a hybrid 365 with onprem dc and exchange, As we may know, we cannot decommission on prem exchange after mailbox migration is finished as on prem exchange manages some of the attributes of user mailboxes.
 Would it be a problem if you you disabled user sync and went cloud only, decommissioned exchange, removed AD attributes, then setup user sync again?

                              <span>Yesterday I discovered that 463 of the 1801 Dutch government domains are unnecessarily vulnerable to code injection and XSS attacks due to the use of static &#x60;nonces&#x60; in the Content-Security-Policy. A &#x60;nonce&#x60; should not be guessable and should be generated randomly on every request. The official documentation is clear on this: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#security-nonces.
 I have reported to the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC), and they confirm the incorrect implementation but do not consider it a security problem. &quot;We will, therefore, not process your report further,&quot; said an anonymous employee. In addition, I was still imposed that I may not disclose which domains are involved.
 I stumbled upon this problem by chance and selflessly took the trouble to map out the scope of the problem and report it properly. I am not in this for a bounty or anything; I just wanted to help out.
 It is disappointing to see that the Dutch government cannot implement basic security measures according to specifications to protect visitors against malicious parties. This was an absolute waste of my time.

 We have implemented Yubikeys as a 2FA method for Windows Login. I have noticed that outlook wants me to enter my yubikey pin, but it doesn’t work and it asks over and over again. Is there anything i can do about that? Thanks in Advance!

                              <span>I&#x27;m working in a monitoring center where we monitor thousands of customer servers based on alarm tickets. Now we have a project where we want to get some statistics about how our center is doing. Basically we want to have some metrics to show to higher-ups if needed. We already have work hours counted based on each ticket we work on. We use ServiceNow as our ticketing system.
 I&#x27;m now asking for any suggestions on some concrete metrics that we could monitor or just any ideas for performance monitoring.
 Luckily our boss is really cool about this process and we can define all the metrics and what is a successful day/week/month ourselves.

                              <span>As the title suggests, I need a better tool than what we currently use.
 Because at the moment, the way we keep track of laptops is an Excel workbook that I have NOW scripted to find duplicates automatically. Before I started the only tool was an Excel workbook without any checks. So completely manual all the way.
 Obviously super inefficient and unsafe, the thing is. I haven&#x27;t been able to find a better solution.
 What do you guys use to keep track of employee laptops?

                              <span>Hey all. Struggling to work out how to troubleshoot this.
 The environment:
 FreeBSD 12.1 on VMware
 Apache 2.4
 MySQL 5.7.31
 Best Practical RT5 5.0.0 (our ticket system)
 The issue:
 Has been running fine for years. Abruptly, Monday morning, apache started consuming 100% CPU and using all available swap. httpd-error.log is full of
 [warning]: Use of uninitialized value $tag in concatenation (.) or string at /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/HTML/Formatter.pm line 150. (/usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/HTML/Formatter.pm:150) 
 ...thousands of them.
 /var/log/messages is likewise full of the slightly more helpful
  Use of uninitialized value $tag in string eq at /usr/local/lib/perl5/site_perl/HTML/Element.pm line 2634. 
 If I stop and restart apache, all goes back to normal for a few minutes, and then starts again.
 I&#x27;ve spend days googling all sorts of thiings but haven&#x27;t found anything useful yet. Anyone able to throw me a bone?
 Thanks,
 Adam

                              <span>I&#x27;m working with a client (well, several) in a relatively small industry, but there&#x27;s a very large player who needs to communicate with them via email.
 ​
 Throughout the year we&#x27;ve been progressively working on improving email hygiene for our clients, this includes add SPF failure (hard-fail and hard-error) quarantining in the email security platform. 
 ​
 the big player has reached out to our client several times, saying we&#x27;re blocking their email. I&#x27;ve tried to reach back, to find the right person, people or team in in the organisation and asked the few contacts I actually have to help me find the wrong person. Their response is &quot;none of our other clients are reporting this problem, you just need to white list us.&quot;
 ​
 Here&#x27;s the thing. They have two SPF records, which fails just on that alone. they have no DKIM keys. They have DMARC configured using proofpoint, but basically acheiving nothing (p&#x3D;none). 
 My response is, well, they need to fix their shit. They created these SPF records, someone must be responsible for it. For us to just white list them (considering the industry) is, imo, the wrong decision to make because it then opens up our client to the risk of receiving fake and/or malicious emails from this sender. 
 ​
 I&#x27;ve communicated with my client serveral times about the issue. So far they haven&#x27;t explicitly (or otherwise) told me to white list it and I know they trust my judgement.
 ​
 So, Am I the Asshole here, for trying to protect my client (and, I suppose the sender, who is ASX50) and trying to refer it back to them to fix their problem?

                              <span>Just curious what people here use for monitoring Data Centers and associated equipment. 
 I am looking to explore alternatives for rack diagrams, pdu monitoring, pdu cable tracking and temperature monitoring via RFID, maybe some more alarming. 
 I&#x27;ve looked at various options out there, but many seem to be over kill, way too expensive or a pain in the ass to run, which means people avoid it.
 Currently using Visual Data Center.

                              <span>Seems like a lot of jobs are asking for your usual route/switch/firewall as well as some AWS skills. I&#x27;m brand new to AWS.
 It&#x27;s confusing to understand what learning path, or resource to start with? I have an INE subscription for learning, if anyone knows of a good AWS course on INE.

                              <span>Reviewing the IP header fields I&#x27;m wondering if anyone could shed some light on why the IP version field is 4 bits long if there are only two options: IPv4 / IPv6. This information could be represented as a 1 bit value instead, freeing up 3 bits from every packet traversing the internet. Is there a reason IPv6 did not change this field to be shorter? It seems like freeing up 3 bits of data from this field would yield global improvements in internet efficiency.
 Now look, I realize that there&#x27;s always smarter people who have thought of something first. So I understand there are likely good reasons for this ineffienct header value. I&#x27;m wondering if anyone could tell me why things are set up the way they are.

 Is netbox free ? Would it work in a large enterprise environment? Does netbox have support ? Is there a sale rep that I can communicate with ? 
 I tried googling but not much information out there regarding netbox. Any help would be appreciated!

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I recently took on a new job as a systems engineer, tasked with discovery and replacing equipment in a 1600 person company, across 60 locations, (6 main locations). One of the locations has three Dell N2000 stacks in different parts of the building. I&#x27;m not too savvy with switches, or VLANs for that matter, but I&#x27;m learning. I&#x27;m understanding these concepts more and more every day and how they&#x27;re applied to this network. I&#x27;m currently doing discovery on this building, but I have no GUI/Web interface to log into for two of the three stacks.
 The MDF has no issues. I&#x27;m able to log into that via IP address no problem.
 I&#x27;m having issues getting into the other IDF stacks. I&#x27;m able to putty into them using SSH no problem. Credentials take which is a great sign. But I&#x27;m still very green to all of this here, and looking at everything visually is way easier for me then CLI, especially when I&#x27;m trying to map out these VLANS and trunked ports, etc.
 Is there anything I need to do to get onto these other stack&#x27;s GUI? I&#x27;m confused as to why just one stack is accessible through GUI, and the others are not.
 Looking for some help on this or pointers! What am I missing here!

 I have tried using an SFP cable to hook the two up, and two different SFP+ cables, one copper, one fiber. With all the cables, I tried port speed auto-negotiation and manually setting it to 2.5g, but the unifi switch cannot detect this 2.5g switch. Any way to link an SFP to an SFP+ port?

These are the model number of android devices and I have several on my network. A typical capture will show (1) the name and mac address of the sender, (2) the Sender Ip address, (3) The Target MAC address as all zeros, and (4) the target IP address as a different IP but the same name. 
 We are not experiencing any new issues but I do not know how long this has been going on. Is it something I should be concerned about?

                              <span>PSA: As you grow and your company starts using more SaaS services for literally everything under the sun, check your PAT pools for exhaustion. It will present as intermittent interruptions and delays at first, and will steadily grow until it starts hitting in massive tidal waves. It&#x27;s in the logs if you are paying attention. I have seen this happen twice in large public companies.

                              <span>I seem to be getting conflicting information on how the IPsec protocol itself handles multiple subnets in a tunnel. I know different vendors have slightly different approaches to this, but I&#x27;m more concerned with what&#x27;s actually possible in the protocol. I&#x27;ve heard the following so far:
  
Multiple subnets are agreed upon in phase 2, all in a single tunnel.
 Multiple phase 2 &quot;tunnels&quot; are created, one for each subnet pair.
 You can&#x27;t do more than one subnet pair in the IPsec protocol. Therefore, multiple phase 1 tunnels are created, one for each subnet pair.
  
I think the 2nd answer is correct, but I can&#x27;t seem to find any detailed information from an authority on it without diving deep into the RFC&#x27;s.
 FWIW, I know it&#x27;s possible to just make a big 0.0.0.0/0 tunnel and deal with the routing myself, but I&#x27;m trying to help a vendor troubleshoot their own stuff on a failover tunnel between us and them. The status on my side shows that in a failover event, only one of the subnet pairs is re-created.
 Edit: I&#x27;m now leaning towards the 1st answer because of the below link. It seems that you can have multiple traffic selectors. Some vendors just &quot;show&quot; this information as multiple phase 2 tunnels? But their terminology isn&#x27;t necessarily accurate, and everything was only negotiated once in phase 2?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m currently trying to help our subsidiary company with installing a new Cisco Meraki firewall.
 Up until this point they have had little to no security built into their firewall. Their old one was basically an allow all rule that configures the firewall like a router. I&#x27;ve told them multiple times this is not acceptable. 
 Long story short I configured the firewall for them, but it did cause some things to break. (I don&#x27;t actually work in their environment so its hard for me to know everything that goes on) 
 Their environment is somewhat complex as they have multiple vpns belonging to clients. Also obviously clients don&#x27;t give out all the security details of their programs so its been tough sledding to this point.
 My question is is what would you do if you were in my shoes? Is it not possible to block a lot of ports due to the size of the company? I&#x27;ve only worked at smaller companies so blocking multiple ports has never been an issue.
 I&#x27;ve read about doing network scans for 24 hours and then analyzing this data. The problem is at this point it is hard to differentiate friend from foe as everything is being let in.
 Any advice or anything really would be of major help.
 ​
 Thanks.

                              <span>I am having an issue with static IP&#x27;s and configuring protection against ARP spoofing on a pretty basic switch ( HPE 1920-48G-PoE+). This switch refers to it as ARP Anti-Attack which is where I configured my trusted ports to other switches and configured it to be enabled on VLAN 1. I have already configured DHCP snooping and everything works as expected as long as a device is using DHCP.
 Now, my issue is with some devices that are using a static IP addresses outside of the DHCP range. My understanding is I should be able to add a static ARP entry in the table for the IP and mac address but for whatever reason it still does not work.
 So my question is:
  
What is the proper way to deal with static IP&#x27;s when enabling ARP Spoofing? I know I can use DHCP reservations but I want to know how to handle this without DHCP.
 If putting static entries in the ARP table is the solution to handling static IPs, what could be causing my issue with this switch?

                              <span>I was recently interested in cg-nat and decided to check whether my ISP of mobile data uses it or not. I discovered that the cg-nat has a range of IPv4 addresses allocated to it(100.64.0.0/10). Ip checking websites showed me having a public ip address, which is typical for cg-nat, however in the phone settings i had a public ip address in the range of 10.0.0.0/8. From my understanding my ISP is indeed using cg-nat, but why is my private IP address not in the scope of addresses allocated for cg-nat? Am I missing something?

I have used &quot;arp -a&quot; in the past, and it does give me a list, but I have no idea if that list is complete, if it shows currently connected devices (or it saves devices that are no longer active), or if there is a better way.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been self-learning computer networking and I&#x27;m nearing the end of the well-known book Computer Networking by Kurose--Ross. (It&#x27;s been a joy.) The book takes a top-down approach through the protocol stack, but it does not really deal with the physical layer. In fact, as it finishes up the link layer, the book explicitly states:
  
Certainly, the physical layer lies below the link layer, but the details of the physical layer are probably best left for another course (for example, in communication theory, rather than computer networking).
  
I&#x27;d be interested in knowing more. Does anyone have any reference recommendations to continue my journey?

                              <span>Question
 I have EVE NG setup and it&#x27;s working well. My lab environment looks like so 
  
VMWARE Workstation - EVE NG (Bridged Mode)
 EVE NG Configured Working on my local network (192.168.0.228)
 Windows 10 workstation (eve ng) 10.1.10.25 (dhcp from switch) Port 1 Cisco Switch
 Cisco Switch (eve ng) 10.1.10.2 and gateway set to 10.1.10.3
 Fortinet VM Firewall (eve ng) (port 0 on cisco) 
 Fortinet VM Firewall Port 2 10.1.10.3 internal to cisco switch port zero
  
​
 So I can connect from the windows machine to the firewall however, Im not sure exactly how to get out to the internet.

                              <span>Ill start by saying that I am do not have my CCNA. Actually, I don&#x27;t have much experience with Cisco at all.
 Im an IT guy for a small company. The current Cisco 3850 switch is severely outdated and we just purchased a new 9300.
 Since I dont have a lot of Cisco experience, I was using the 9300 to go over some CCNA labs before installing this in production. I made some errors and ended up factory resetting the switch.
 Now, Im getting bootable url&#x27;s in boot variable not found or exhausted
 please check the rommon configuration or boot command usage.
 ​
 I downloaded the image from Cisco&#x27;s site, installed and can get back into the webui and run commands and everything seems fine, until I reboot the switch. After rebooting, it get the &quot;bootable url in boot variable not found&quot; message again.I made sure to save my configuration settings before restarting.
 Ive been Googling this for a day and its driving me insane, but Im sure its something stupid that Im missing.
 Any help would be very greatly appreciated!
 ​
 ​
 Edit: If I boot from the USB drive with the image on it, I am able to get to all of my settings. I can take the USB out and get to my webui and all my configurations appear to be there, but if I dont reboot it with the USB, then I get the &quot;bootable url&quot; error.
 It almost seems like maybe the image isnt saved to the switch
 ​

 Edit 2: RESOLVED. Resolution in comments!

                              <span>Hello all,
 Im trying to understand what the difference is between the Cisco ASA vs FPR vs FTD. 
 When reading documentation, ASA is replaced by the NGFW: Firepower. The ASA lacked for example IPS and had a basic software. The FPR can now provide URL filtering, application control etc.. 
 But.. how is the FPR managed compared to the ASA? Do you managed it via CLI or GUI (or both)? What more differences are there between these two more than the above stated? I also read about the FTD, what does this exactly do? It seems to me that FTD is a software, but what does it run on?
 I probably mix all of these but I would like some clarification.

                              <span>For those that have their Webex traffic going through a proxy:
 Do you use a normal TCP Proxy?
 We currently do and experience sound/video quality problems that are bad enough to annoy the users.
 As we would rather like to continue to have all internet traffic go through a proxy we consider trying a SOCKS proxy. So, does anyone have experience with Webex through a SOCKS proxy? Does it help to mitigate latency problems?
 If yes, how do you redirect the UDP data stream to the SOCKS proxy? We use PAC scripts to redirect traffic depending on URL but that doesn&#x27;t help to sort the UDP and TCP traffic to their respective proxy.

                              <span>I need to somehow force SFP port UP on Cisco 2960x when only RX is connected. 
 Reason for this is that we are using TAP, which outputs TX/TX. Each of the TX are connected to their own separated GBIC on the Cisco 2960x. TX port on the gbic stays unplugged. This setup works on older Cisco 2960g, and port comes up even with the TX port unplugged. However, on Cisco 2960x it doesnt work and port doesnt come up.
 Is there some configuration option to setup sfp port to go up when only RX is connected?

                              <span>So I&#x27;m making a small setup for a secondary building on the lowest budget possible but to be able to handle about 100 clients (worst case scenario) on one access point. I&#x27;m not gonna get a console like a dream machine because it&#x27;s not worth it for this setup. 
 I was thinking of using just two AC or U6 pro APs in &quot;standalone mode&quot; and connecting them to a router &amp; switch I already have. Pretty much a &quot;dumb access point&quot;
 Is it worth it to get Unifi access points for this or are there cheaper alternatives that would do the same (since you do pay a premium to have everything &quot;just work&quot; with ubiquity&quot; Any suggestions are appreciated! 
 Thanks,

                              <span>See title. I&#x27;m looking for a ping monitoring tool (any recommandations ? optionnally would be cool if it could monitor disconnections too) and, sorry for the stupid question, but if it&#x27;s constantly pinging to check that data, will it affect my speed/ping ingame?

                              <span>(Posted this over at /r/aws but it got flagged for moderation, so giving it a shot here). 
 I&#x27;ve worked for 5 years in AWS/devops/etc. in large companies where this was already established and we had an on-premise network, so we had the full bells and whistles of Direct Connect.
 Now I&#x27;ve joined a startup and we&#x27;re setting up our own AWS environment, and establishing private connectivity from scratch is uncharted ground for me. As a startup, we are essentially all &quot;floating&quot; right now --- we don&#x27;t have a dedicated office with a dedicated network range, or any sort of on-premise presence.
 But, we need a way to access EC2, RDS, etc. without public IP addresses (and preferably without a publicly exposed bastion/jumpbox to get there). We don&#x27;t have anything massively critical, and we will grow, so by the time we do, we can revisit this to really flesh out a sturdy solution. But right now I just need some basic items I can go through to ensure only our people can access our AWS resources.
 For VPN options that aren&#x27;t site-to-site, &quot;Client VPN&quot; seems like an option: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/introducing-aws-client-vpn-to-securely-access-aws-and-on-premises-resources/
 If someone can just tell me if I&#x27;m warm or cold on this, and point me in the direction of the necessary service/tool that I need, that would be great. Thanks!

                              <span>We are physically separating our distribution nodes and having to put in two L3 devices between them for encryption reasons. I’m trying to explain to my coworkers that if we do that HSRP will not work due to the switches not being able to directly see each other (there now being two hops to get to the other). I’ve tried setting something up in a lab of course I didn’t get it to work but I wanted to get y’all’s input on a better explanation on why this wouldn’t work OR if it can work and I’m just missing something.

                              <span>Assuming you have a SoT like Netbox and some device discovery software like solarwinds. I&#x27;m always confused which one should be the entry point for device on-boarding?
 Add device to Solarwinds and then Solarwinds populates Netbox with all device information?
 OR
 Populate the device in Netbox and then it adds the device to Solarwinds
 The issue here is circular dependency, Netbox should be the ultimate SoT meaning it dictates the intent whether to have the device in the network in the first place or not, how the interfaces should look like, IP addresses etc.., so in a sense, it must be the entry point. but at the same the device needs to be populated first to see that are the interfaces, IPs etc.
 in a sense both should be diff&#x27;ed to see the actual vs intended and point out if there&#x27;s a deviation, but i&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s the best approach to start integrating both. any thoughts?

                              <span>My friend just told me he was checking out PortMaster, which I wasn&#x27;t familiar with. I took a brief glance at their page and some of Safing&#x27;s documentation (which I believe sounds like an extra service on top of the open source portmaster), and I&#x27;m trying to understand -
 Is this essentially application filtering, but on a local firewall as opposed to a network device? 
 I understand portmaster itself is open source and very configurable and safing has some extra services they&#x27;ve built that portmaster can leverage, but ignoring all that portmaster is more or less a software firewall kind of like pfsense, just for your local machine?

                              <span>What are you guys using as CPEs for consumer FTTH Active Ethernet networks?
 Our current vendors are having supply chain issues, so I&#x27;m open to other options. 
 Cost is a bit of an issue, as the consumer ARPU isn&#x27;t that high. 1G is fine, 10G is lovely, but not at any price. Must have either SFP or BiDi optics.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m having an issue with the sponsored guest portal on ISE I&#x27;ve set up for our Guest wireless.
 I&#x27;ve setup everything, so, policy sets (and everything that goes with it), Meraki SSID side of things and a Guest Portal, Guest Type, Sponsor Portal and a Sponsor Group.
 When a user logs in they get redirected to the Guest Portal, where they are given the chance to register and then from there they register fine, an approval email goes out, as well as me seeing the account created on the Sponsor Portal to, I approve the account. I can see the username/pw etc... but when the user tries to login with the creds, it fails with an Authentication Failed error.
 The guests are registering their devices in the GuestEndPoints internal store (but not showing up in there)
 In the logs I can see the users request actually pass and being permitted also (so it passes the check on the GuestEndPoints store to, I think because this laptop has already logged in tbf on the network many times prior to this)
 But for whatever reason I cannot get the user to login.
 I have 2 authorisation policies in the policy set to, the second one matches on the wireless type (wireless MAB) which is what shows up in the logs, the first in the chain is a policy that matches on the wireless authentication type again (wireless MAB) but also the Radius Case being &quot;Guest Flow&quot; also, with the VLAN authorisation profile I want to give the guest. I assumed this is done via somekind of CoA on ISE after the user is approved, but this policy never shows up in the logs and is never hit

Looking at using 9410s to support some critical manufacturing. Would love to hear how others take advantage of them.

                              <span>Hi in my current environment we only have one Cisco aci eigrp l3 out toward our core router/switches at the moment. We will be expanding aci to our secondary dc via multipod and spine tk spine implementation. That one will also have a layer 3 out to its corresponding core router/switch I’ll add a diagram soon. ? Is how can I redistribute static routes into the aci’s fabrics eigrp,(cores run eigrp too) but we have some static’s for x reasons? The core routers are connected to each other via L3/l2 I was going to try to configure the L3 outs just like any other dual multihomed connections and just weigh them or keep them balanced. Feel free to flame but while I research wanted to see what other net peeps thought.

                              <span>Good afternoon,
 I have a question for the folks who work in big ISPs who perform CGNAT and PBA for customers. 
 What happens when a customer requires a new port block to be allocated, and the current IP they have the port block for has all ports exhausted? Theoretically, whatever devices should try to free up port blocks for that IP, but if it can&#x27;t, I assume the user gets a different port block on a different public IP. Now the user has 1 port block on one IP and another port block on a different IP. 
 I can imagine how this would impact various applications, but would like someone who runs this in a large production environment to shed some light on this.
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a very simple playbook to use cisco.iosxr.iosxr_command from the galaxy collection for iosxr to push some raw config commands.
 It works against the ASR9k platform, but not against an NCS540 with no changes to code or connect method or any of the host/group vars compared to what I&#x27;m doing for the ASR chassis.
 The error isn&#x27;t specific to a config not being liked, but rather it&#x27;s like it&#x27;s failing to connect (I&#x27;ve tried with AAA in place and using local creds only even though there&#x27;s no login specific error).
 ​
 The error I&#x27;m getting is &quot;msg&quot;: &quot;[Errno -2] Name or service not known&quot; when it goes to run the first task. the full verbose traceback which states it may not be related to the actual failure only references 2 things.... some iosxr.py file from the collection itself, line 179 get_capabilities.... capabilities &#x3D; Connection(module._socket_path).get_capabilities() and a reference to a connection.py file in ansible module_utils line 200 in __rpc__ raise ConnectionError(to_text(msg, errors&#x3D;&#x27;surrogate_then_replace&#x27;), code&#x3D;code) followed by my task that just sends configure terminal and some simple logging commands.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve confirmed all of the commands work fine on the NCS platform. The error is the same regardless of if I use any other iosxr method like for banners or logging which is why I tried switching to iosxr_command to rule out any weirdness but it&#x27;s still there and only when pushing to the NCS540.
 I&#x27;m using network_cli for the connection and iosxr for the network_os in the group_vars vars file for this platform, same as the ASR.
 ​
 Any ideas? Any help is appreciated!

 I have user and guest SSIDs running through two ISE nodes.
 All ok if the work of the ISE is done by the &quot;master&quot; node, instead it doesn&#x27;t work if the ISE on the track is the &quot;slave&quot;.
 This causes it to have no HA, which is very strange since the fixtures are synchronized.
 What do you think? Where can I make sure they are actually in sync and back up each other?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 Not a network expert by any means so would like some insight or direction as to whether this is an issue or I&#x27;m barking up the wrong tree etc.
 Our client uses this ZScaler App to route all traffic to a UK range they host.
 Example IP would be: 165.225.16.240
 IF I ping this IP there is some loss of packets, ranges between 2-5%. If I ping Google there is no packet loss.
 When I do a traceroute there is always packet loss at the Zayo hop:
 Tracing route to 165.225.17.15 over a maximum of 30 hops:
 1 1 ms &lt;1 ms &lt;1 ms 192.168.99.1
 2 23 ms 32 ms 1 ms 62......
 (Exits Network Gateway)
 3 1 ms 1 ms 1 ms 212......
 4 6 ms 4 ms 2 ms 62.........
 5 8 ms 2 ms 7 ms ge-3-3-0.mpr1.lhr3.uk.above.net [195.66.236.76]
 6 3 ms \ ** ae9.cs1.lhr15.uk.eth.zayo.com [64.125.24.210]
 7 \ * * Request timed out.*
 8 8 ms 6 ms 9 ms 94.31.30.187.IPYX-069051-042-ZYO.zip.zayo.com [94.31.30.187]
 9 4 ms 4 ms 10 ms 165.225.17.15
 Another reading.. before it reaches the ZScaler service:
 Host Longitude Latitude Location Name Packet Sent Packet Received Loss
 ae9.cs1.lhr15.uk.eth.zayo.com 37.751 -97.822 United States 300 80 73.333336
 ae12.mpr3.lhr8.uk.zip.zayo.com 37.751 -97.822 United States 300 252 16
 ZScaler confirmed nothing to do with them, a third party ISP. So am I looking to engage with our ISP about this you reckon?
 Or am I just barking up the wrong tree and this is nothing to be worried about?
 The client say they are being disconnected random times.. when I check the on-site MX i cant see any issues with latency or packet loss etc.. no downtime of any sort.. i can only think the zscaler service is going down and maybe confusing the clients network adapter switching from zscaler back to lan etc..
 Anyway can someone let me know if this Zayo route is a ISP issue or ZScaler.
 Cheers.

                              <span>Working with a school that has a lot of old iMacs where many of them are accessing with 100mbps FE.
 We have 10 48port switches
 The rack was punched down to spread the wireless access points, phones, and currently unused ports across the switches for power budget and to keep all the eggs out of one basket.
 The budget for new computers didn&#x27;t go through so we have at least the rest of the school year.
 Does having all these slow devices hinder the other items in the switch? What about some of the 10mbps Devices like access control, intercom links, and VOIP phones?
 Would it be better to put all the 100mbps Macs on one switch where they can be in the slow lane on their own?

                              <span>Hey guys
 We&#x27;re running DNAC and from its reporting section I can pull a list of switches that have port utilisation of over 50%,over 75% &amp; over 90%. What I&#x27;m trying to do is just get a list of every switch I have in DNAC along with its current port utilisation. A lot of our switches are under-utilised and I want to identify them. 
 Any ideas? Thanks.

                              <span>So basically I have several Jetson (embedded device with Ubuntu-like system) devices running some ML/MV applications in a site, these devices should connect to some network, either through Ethernet or WiFi.
 I want to be able to monitor the status of the devices, update files and start some actions on the devices. 
 Essentially I need some network-wide remote access to the devices.
 Any ideas how can this be achieved ? or what type of network should I look for ? Is there something similar I can get inspiration from ?
 The network should be able to endure high bandwidth of data exchange (20-300MBs).

                              <span>I understand you need to configure the links on each member.
 i.e.
 Switch 1 vsf member 1 link 1 1/51 vsf member 1 link 2 1/52 Switch 2 vsf member 2 link 1 52 vsf member 2 link 2 51 
 Question is does &quot;link 1&quot; (port 51) on switch one need to plug into what I have designated &quot;link 1&quot; (port 52) on the second switch or are the link numbers arbitrary?

 (My first post is here https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/u71pdr/problems_with_dhcp_relay/)
 ​
 Now I have a lightly different infrastructure, with a (little) more straight approach. At least that&#x27;s how I see it.
 ​
 I have my main DHCP server running as a Hyper-V VM, connected to our network. On this DHCP server, I have the scopes 192.168.93.0/24 and 192.168.103.0/24 (from .10 to .100).
 ​
 Running in other Hyper-V I have another Windows VM for this test. This computer has its own Virtual Switch.
 ​
 On my Cisco CBS350, I have VLAN1 and VLAN103.
 My DHCP server is connected to a trunk port. Its IP is 192.168.93.2.
 My test client is connected to an access port, that is part of VLAN103.
 The VLAN103 has a fixed IP, 192.168.103…</span>

Exec hires that can plug in their tv for superbowl but cannot connect there monitors after moving desks. I need a hobby outside of tech or a permanent vacation. 10 plus years in the biz im am over it all. 
 Oh and &quot;you work in IT?&quot; from friends and family yeah no. 185 per hour. To expensive? ok google is i guess since you stated thats all i do anyway.

                              <span>Well guys Ive got a question I need some insight on. After working as a sysadmin at a company for 17 years I was let go today.
 My manager says I was let go for having issues one too many times. And I have made mistakes. Ive tried to correct those and move one. The straw that broke the camels back was when a script Ive run for years to reset system account passwords went sideways and accidentally locked out like 50 service accounts. 
 But Im about a decade away from retirement and I was burned out there. Over the years management has expected more and more out of my team and I admit as I gotten older Ive had more and more trouble staying sharp and motivated.
 If I stay in IT how do I spin &quot;hey Im 50+, and got burned out at my old job&quot;?
 Im even thinking I may not want to stay in IT. What do you guys think?

                              <span>About two years ago I started at a small/medium business with a few hundred employees. We were almost all on prem, very few cloud services outside of MS365. The company previously had one guy who was essentially &quot;good with computers&quot; set things up but they grew to the size where they needed an IT guy full time, which isn&#x27;t super unusual.
 But the owner was incredibly cheap. When I started they had a few working virtual host servers but they had zero backups - absolutely nothing on prem was being backed up externally. In my first month there I went to the owner and explained how bad things would be if we didn&#x27;t have any off site backups we were doomed. I looked into free cloud alternatives but there wasn&#x27;t anything that would fit our needs.
 Management was very clear - the budget for backups is $0, and &quot;nothing is going to happen, you worry too much&quot;
 So I decided to do it myself. I figured out how much I could set aside each week and started saving. I didn&#x27;t make a whole lot but I did have extra money each month. I was determined to have a disaster recovery plan, even if they didn&#x27;t want to pay for it.
 And some of you may remember, Hurricane Ian hit a few months ago. We were not originally predicted to take the brunt of it, and management wanted no downtime, so we did not physically remove the server from the premises. The storm damaged the building and we experienced some pretty severe data loss. 
 So it was time for my disaster recovery plan. The day after, we gathered at the building and discovered the damage. After confirming we had lost data, I said &quot;I quit,&quot; I got in my car, and lived off the 6 months of savings I had. Tomorrow I start my new job. Disaster recovery plan worked exactly how I planned.

 Xerox Universal Printer driver renames my shared printers after gpo drops them.
 It deploys as HR-Xerox printer and a moment after is over written with name &quot;Xerox AltaLink C8030/c8035. What is even more odd is when you go to actually print from say notepad it shows the proper share name?

                              <span>So last week I received a Teams message from a senior person in HR that they needed to talk to me and wanted to know if my calendar was updated. I quickly responded that it was and went about my business. I then received a meeting request show up in my email box. It included HR VP, Legal, Recruiting and the CFO.
 Initially I didn&#x27;t think about it because I was busy. Then as I slowed down and thought about it and all weekend I freaked myself out about it. Why was HR calling me and why was legal included.
 I sheepishly walked into HR office today not knowing what to expect. As it turns out they want to replace the applicant tracking system and needed my support.
 I relayed my angst to the HR folks before the meeting got going. They thought it was funny and laughed it off about a guilty conscience. 
 How many ways can an IT guy mess up and not even know it? HR Should be more thorough in their communications.

                              <span>A cable tester is showing me that one of the pairs of a 120ft cat6 run (that&#x27;s getting no connection ) is about 10 feet short, from both directions.
 Re-terminated both ends twice to make sure.
 So cable test is showing Orange: 110ft, Green: 122ft, Blue: 122ft, Brown: 122ft. when done from either end. But all pairs mark as good.
 Getting no link or connection on it either, so it&#x27;s not like it&#x27;s even working.

 How&#x27;s y&#x27;alls Tuesday.

                              <span>Has anyone had any experience merging two Slack workspaces? Hoping to see if there’s any watch-outs. 
 We’re on the ‘Pro’ plan, so we have to do a special request from Slackcorp for both company’s data (private channels and messages). 
 Just curious what everyone’s experience has been in this situation. Thanks!

&quot;Any Windows user account that interacts with the VTS software on
 the Administration, Proctor, or exam delivery workstation is required
 to have local administrator rights on that workstation. This includes both
 installing and running the VTS software.&quot;
  
Killing a fly with a sledgehammer much?
 I can use ProcMon to try to find what permissions are actually needed, but maybe some kind soul can save me the hassle?

                              <span>I have an enclosed half rack at a datacenter. It&#x27;s an older rack where it doesn&#x27;t have mounting holes for 0U style things on the side. The two PDUs provided by the DC are horizontal and on the bottom of the rack and supply 208v power with c14 locking outlets. After a mix of multiple 1U/2U servers, routers, and switches that all have redundant power supplies I am both out of outlets and the bundle of power cables on the side is out of hand. I used some d ring but those also take up 1U since the server rails are the nice quick install ones from HP/Dell. The DC has suggested Y splitter cables which I would like to avoid as they seem a point of failure. I wanted to know how anyone has solved this in the past? Are there d-rings that work with server rails, is there some nice way to organize this that I don&#x27;t know?

                              <span>Anyone find a nice way to resign while stuck in the middle of several projects?
 I just accepted an offer with my old employer after getting fed up with poor corporate culture and being asked to handle too many tasks in the 11 months I have been with new job. I was going to walk from my new job almost immediately but I decided to keep working through my disdain for my current employer. It didn&#x27;t work out. I am burned out after less than a year. Now I have a heaping plate of projects that I am going to leave up for my Director of IT to deal with all by himself. I&#x27;m honestly terrified to hand in my letter of resignation I see it ending with getting screamed at by the IT Director followed by him having a stroke. The place I am at now needs a whole IT Department I carry all the Infrastructure Engineer, Network Engineer, Systems administration and Help Desk Duties for a $500M a year company.
 I would honestly just walk out if I didn&#x27;t live in such a small community. I would run into the people I fuck over pretty frequently if I did.
 ​
 UPDATE:
 Haha I haven&#x27;t drafted a resignation letter yet and just had 2 more projects dumped on me.

 Not sure what the point of this post is, I think I am just trying to get out some nervous energy. Can anyone else tell me what their second interview was like? I&#x27;ve never been on a second interview before - the questions I know how to answer, I answered in the first interview. No idea what to expect on this one.

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 I have a virtual machine, that multiple users join via Remote Desktop, and they all use the same local user (MACHINENAME\USERNAME) so they all have the exact same everything everywhere including applications;
 Problem is that, being more than 5 users, they don&#x27;t really know when or if someone else is already connected to it, so they always kick out one each other without notice;
 Is there a way to prevent this? Could I limit the number of remote sessions or to &quot;lock&quot; it until someone disconnects? Or even just find a way for them to see if someone&#x27;s already using it?
 Thank you very much in advice, have a great day!

                              <span>Hi,
 So I have a Microsoft Surface Tablet that is going to be deployed in a public facing area. Essentially, it will be on a website with two options, the main one being to print a label that a user has been emailed. Clicking that button opens the camera and scans a QR code, once code has been read it will prompt the user to click a print label button where i&#x27;d like it to silently print said label to an attached label printer. The site is all working and tested fine.
 So i&#x27;ve created an intune profile for the browser, using Microsoft Kiosk Browser app rather than Edge so that it displays fullscreen with no navigation bars etc. There is an additional configuration profile setup to Force Allow the browser access to the camera. The first part works fine, However the print page takes me to an error page (the page works in normal edge so i know it works) the error shows:
 sorry that file type is unsupported blob:[mywebsiteaddress] 
 So i&#x27;m assuming that the Kiosk Browser app doesn&#x27;t support printing?.
 If i then change the browser in the configuration profile to MS Edge, printing will work fine, however, its not a full screen browser window and has navigation options, I still get the prompts to allow the camera, and I also get a print dialog screen which i really don&#x27;t want. 
 My questions are:
  
Can someone pin point where that first error might come from with regards to printing in the Kiosk Browser app
 If not, is there a way or an option that im missing to force edge into full screen mode and allow the camera access and disable the print screen.
  
The Kiosk Browser is the prefered option.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 This is going to be a long and detailed post and I am going to get into some specifics about my issues at my current workplace and a coworker that I&#x27;ve been battling with for a while now. Some pieces of information will be obfuscated for obvious reasons. At this point, I am not sure what else I can do anymore since I have done everything I possibly can. I&#x27;ve been working here for a few months, and it seems like it has not been working out ever since the very first month. Not sure what I can really do aside from leaving but let me know if anyone has any thoughts on this matter or if I&#x27;m being whiny.
 Ever since I joined the company a few months ago, I&#x27;ve had this coworker (let&#x27;s call him Bob) who is a senior sysadmin on the team that seems to be a very closed minded individual th…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve worked in my organization (which is part of a much bigger organization with LOTS of group policies and startup apps globally) for 20+ years so it all seems normal to me. But one of my (very tightly wrapped) users actually timed it today and reports it was 4 minutes and 48 seconds from turning on the power to being able to open an email this morning. How does that compare with what other folks see?
 There is an after work beer awaiting the results of this very unscientific poll.
 Edit: No roaming profiles. Laptop with an SSD. This is at the office not WFH.
 I won&#x27;t able to FIX this. The GPOs are set WAY above what I can modify. But tell me if this is stupid slow or typical in a corporate environment pretty please? 
 Also, you guys are great :-)

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to implement a central access policy on a file share that will secure files that have not been classified by FCI from everyone but the owner/creator of the file. The issue is that with office files, a hidden lock file is created when an Office file (docs, xlsx, etc.) is opened by a user. This file contains the meta data for who has a file locked in case someone else on the network tries to open it. Since they are unable to access the file, a message states the file is locked by &quot;User&quot; instead of the actual user&#x27;s name.
 The only identifying features I can find for these files are the first 2 characters of the file name are always ~$ and that their file properties lists HSA as attributes.
 Is there already an AD attribute I can use for FCI that can reference either the first 2 characters of the file name HSA attribute of the file so I can allow read only access?

                              <span>Hi guys, I&#x27;ve let my skillset get rusty lately. The last time I had my own lab I was using an old PC as a ESX host with a bunch of VMs on it. 
 My newish job has a bunch of technologies I&#x27;m not that familiar with. Ansible, kubernetes, docker.. it&#x27;s predominantly a Linux environment. I&#x27;m thinking of spinning up a lab that can somehow incorporate all these elements.
 How do you guys manage your own personal labs these days? Is it still best to get a physical server? I&#x27;m traveling around a lot so a cloud based solution would be ideal, unless I setup wake on LAN with a server or something. 
 I suppose if it&#x27;s a bunch of Linux VMs they&#x27;ll be fairly low resource requirements so maybe it wouldn&#x27;t be too costly in the cloud.
 How do you guys manage your personal lab?

                              <span>hello all! 
 I am trying to install windows server 2022 in a VM and setup up a domain for learning purposes.
 Now the first thing i do is set a static IP and change the computer name. i change the computer to DC01. When i am promoting the server to a domain controller and am at the stage to set the netBIOS name. I type in DC01 and i recieve the error that this name is already being used. Can the computer name not be the same as the NetBIOS name? I thought these shut be the same

                              <span>Hello i have 2019 rds enviroment and user have netwerk shares through GPO they cant browse to the netwerk share if they go directly to the adres. 
 But the problem is now that we have 1 shares which is hidden and has a program on it which we have shortcut to on everyones desktop. 
 If you just right click on this icon you click on open file location then you can still go to the hidden network share which is blocked if you type in the adres in the file explorer how is this possible? 
 Is there GPO or something im missing? that prevents this? 
 I have found the option to remove open file location option all together but we dont want that we only want it prevented for that specify hidden share. 
 Excuses for spelling errors.

She did it anyway and they centrally deleted the folders she&#x27;d created. She has a lot of clients, deals, etc that she wants to organize within Outlook and now she can&#x27;t.
 My only question is why do they do that? Is there a security reason or what? I don&#x27;t get it.

 I&#x27;d like to install WSUS, but configure to not download updates locally - just block or approve updates and the client machines download the updates themselves. 
 Will this still be write-intensive? I know it might do a bunch of writing to the internal WSUS database, but I&#x27;m not sure if it would be particularly damaging to an SSD

The thing is, i want to learn new stuff bc i want to work as a Linux/Network-Admin asap, but i feel like i‘m not ready for it yet. So, do u got any ideas what i could do with a linux server for learning all this stuff and gaining new skills? I just want to try stuff by myself so i learn it quicker, so just tell me whatever gets in ur mind. Stuff like installing a mailserver or connecting the Server with a windows-pc with samba.

 Was hoping to reach out to someone who has implemented the below reg key.
 I am looking at improving log-on speeds in my organisation and this key shaves off around 20 seconds BUT I have no idea what it is doing, nor can I find anything online that&#x27;s official! 
 Was just hoping to see if anyone else implements it and what value it is set as. 
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\System 
  
Value – DelayedDesktopSwitchTimeout
 Type – DWORD
 Data – 1

 I am looking for an MDM to deploy at my current company which uses no MDM at all and are heavily reliant google workspace. The company consists of around 100 users.
 I&#x27;ve been looking at solutions such as Intune however from what I understand, it does not incorporate Google Workspace.
 I am looking for a MDM which can support both windows and mac.

                              <span>I’m using Robocopy to migrate files from our production file server to an archive file server.
 I have performed a dry run and the total dataset summarised is 3TB and approximately 2M files.
 On the production server (Windows 2016) I run the data dedupe service, and we achieve a huge benefit from this as the volume is 2TB but the data on it is around 4TB and I have .5TB free space reported. My current Deduplication rate for the production volume is 67%
 If I run my live Robocopy job to migrate the folder that has 3TB reported will it retain the deduplication when moved or will it try to move 3TB of data onto the volume? Essentially undoing the dedupe.
 My Archive server has 1.1TB free space on the data volume (which is the same size as our production file server at 2TB) and also has deduplication service enabled.
 I do have the capability to spin backups of these VMs up in a lab to test the move works but with that amount of data it will take quite some time, so hoping someone here can provide some insight into their experience moving similar sized datasets.
 Cheers

                              <span>As the title says, what makes you believe online password managers like LastPass, 1Password etc are really end to end encrypted, there are no intentional backdoors or that they won&#x27;t sell your passwords to any 3rd party? Is it just their privacy policy? 
 Or is it just the fact that the benefits of using a password manager at all greatly outweighs the risks of password manager company &quot;turning to the dark side&quot;?
 By using a password manager, you are in fact completely trusting your digital identity and privacy to them. If I were any government&#x27;s agency, I&#x27;d sponsor my own password manager so that all people are willingly handing their identities over to me and I wouldn&#x27;t even need to move a finger...
 Personally, I&#x27;m using KeePass which is open source so that much wider community is able to review it&#x27;s code for possible weaknesses and, more importantly, backdoors. I&#x27;m also using a composite master key to unlock the database. One part is stored locally on my devices while the other part is a password that I regularly type. This way I can keep my password reasonably short for greater convenience and still practically impossible to brute-force by anyone that could possible get hold of my database. This enables me to keep the database in the cloud, which I also do not trust.

                              <span>Some background first. I&#x27;m a sysadmin / head of IT for a company of 150. Thankfully we&#x27;ve employed another person to deal with helpdesk and minor issues last year, so that&#x27;s good. Backup system is decent. Hopefully we will be buying a tape library in the next year to bullet proof it. People call me or inform me when they get suspicious email without opening attachments or clicking links.
 Now for the main thing. Since the ransomware we had in daughter company in 2019, every time someone contacts me with a computer, server or other it issue or I get an alarm from our systems I almost get a panic attack. Same thing when something unexpected happens when working on my pc whether it is a warning or a window pops up or a random web page stops responding for a second or two. It was not that bad in the beginning but the last 6 months were bad to the point I think of quitting without another job lined up. I have the monetary means to do it, but I would rather dealt with the issue.
 Talking with my boss and the owner is definitely on my list. How else can I deal with it?

 I&#x27;ve got a few Windows 365 Enterprise pcs up and running, and I&#x27;ve not had any issues until now
 I have one user who when he tries to connect, gets the error message &quot;To sign in remotely, you need the right to sign in through Remote Desktop Services. By default, members of the Remote Desktop Users group blah blah blah&quot;
 He&#x27;s assigned a licence. He&#x27;s in the Remote Desktop Users group for that VM.
 What am I missing?

 I would like to know if anyone here knows how I can monitor my Carbonite backups in Centreon to see Errors, Warnings etc.
 We already do replication monitoring using a script with the Vault&#x27;s logs files, but we have no idea for backup checks at the moment.
 And unfortunately the &quot;Go Veeam&quot; answer is not possible.

 Can someone explain to me how we purchase Microsoft sql server 2019/2022 standard edition (outright, subscription or er processor)? Can’t purchase it through O365, not part of our volume license, link on Microsoft website is busted. I’ve done research into the pricing models but can’t find a damn way to get licences.

                              <span>We just renewed our license for our helpdesk. When I had some quality time with the boss I asked him what he thought of the helpdesk we’ve had for a year now. 
 We used to all (4 of us) just operate out of a shared mailbox. A lot of the time we’d double or triple-up on work because of the shared mailbox. We would all unknowingly work on the same thing. 
 I like the system because I have a clear list of things to work on and if I start working on something I pick it up and it’s mine. If one of the other guys starts working on it, since I’m generally faster I can be like “bro, gotta pick up what you’re working on.” (That sounds more asshole than I mean, I swear)
 Boss’ main complaint is he can’t easily tell what we’re all working on without going into our individual queues. He feels out of touch with what we’re doing. 
 So does anyone have any suggestions for a ME SD+ report that can show him what we’re currently working on and have for the last X days? Something he can quickly run to make sure we’re doing our jobs? We’re hosted so any grand ideas I have for report options are limited, and the interface is lacking (at least for me). Tried posting similar requests on the ME sub but it’s moderated to hell and nothing has been approved.

                              <span>noob question: I have four physical windows 10 pro PCs connected to a ml350p HP gen 8 running windows 2016 server (which has 3 virtual desktops) for my small business. My team connects to their physical or desktop PC remotely. ML350p is my domain controller. Assume I only use ML350p for the virtual desktops and to share files.
 All good. Except the ml350p is in my flat. It&#x27;s big, throws off heat and can get get quite noisy.
 What to do?
  
AWS virtual desktops seem really expensive eg 67 USD per month per standard desktop.
 I could get an AWS windows server but then how do i connect my physical desktop PCs to it on the domain, i think i need a VPN?
 I have [unused] one drive for business so i could get rid of the ml350p and get a few more desktops and restrict one drive for business to those physical PCs (for security i can&#x27;t let any personal PC access the one drive)
 Could I (eg) get a t3.2xlarge aws server (USD ~ 400 per month) and create seven desktop VMs on that? or would i need more windows licences/Ad server/costs?
  
I am happy to have a few more physical desktops that people remote into. I want to get rid of the physical server. I still don&#x27;t really get it - option 4 would be USD 4800 per year. i could buy a new physical server and a 2019 licence for that and then save the 4800 per year.
 I am desktop PC proficient, (build my own), pretty numerate but I find windows server really opaque. I am lost in the jargon and the options.

 Quick question: what would you guys use to send a mail with a report whenever a file is created inside that folder? Task Scheduler or some other tool? 
 Thanks for the help &amp; kind regards!

                              <span>I&#x27;m considering running DMZ traffic over a VLAN trunk with some other LAN VLANs and was just wanting to confirm some assumptions I&#x27;m making in this consideration. I realize the best scenario here is to use a completely separate set of cables and switches for the DMZ network, but I&#x27;d like to avoid this if I can for the sake of this consideration.
 As a hypothetical example for the purposes of this question, I have a router, a Layer 2 managed switch, some user PCs, and a server running a publicly-accessible website.
 I have two VLANs I want to use, VLAN2 and VLAN3:
  
VLAN2 is the LAN, the user PCs are connected to this. The switch is configured to tag to VLAN2 the incoming untagged packets from user PCs on the VLAN2 ports.
 VLAN3 is the DMZ for WAN traffic the firewall permits through to ac…</span>

                              <span>I’m looking for some guidance in the right direction. I’m familiar with the basic concepts of networking but there a few concepts i am looking to understand better. 
  
The first revolves around BGP in the data center. I understand that this is really dependent on what your doing/goal. To lay this out based on my lab in EVE-ng let’s say I’ve got two nexus switches. Each one handles an ISP connection. The ISPs have 2 /30s and we are advertises out a /24. Does it make sense to have the switches handle the BGP or is it more common practice to have a device dedicated to that and the switches handle things like vxlan/spine leaf topology. 
 
How do firewalls get implemented? I can’t imagine data center firewalls would be doing router on a stick and the wan side just points to whatever is advertising the BGP? I guess I’m thinking of this as a regular office firewall but I can’t quite figure out how to google implementing a firewall into a data center.

                              <span>Based on a response to a previous question in which I asked why my local library had a such a large subnet mask (and thus possibly a large broadcast domain [255.0.0.0]), I looked up &quot;broadcast suppression&quot;. 
 Based on the documentation, the falling threshold for storm-control can be equal to or lower than the rising threshold. Why would I need to make them equal? And how would the CPU know when to block and unblock if it had different instructions for the same value? 
 Something to do with the time interval?

However, I have learned enough to be able to set dual-mode/native vlans on ethernet ports (1/1/1-1/1/24) but I can&#x27;t seem to get the same process to set dual-mode/native vlans on fiber ports (1/2/1-1/2/4). I have tried from the command line as well as the web interface. The VLANs page in the configuration looks correct - every vlan is tagged (except the default vlan) and then dual-mode is set on the native vlan that I want. However, when I got to the fiber port, it will still show vlan 0 as the native vlan even if I have set dual-mode on vlan 999.
 I know I&#x27;m missing something but my searches so far have turned up nothing. Thanks for any help you can provide.

 I have encountered an issue which I do not believe is in my control to fix, but I would like to understand what could be the cause.
 One of offices uses facilities provided wireless network where our users connect to and then establish Always On VPN over SSTP protocol to HQ. As much it is odd, this is necessary as all our computers use HQ located Proxy (for now as it is going to be replaced with cloud proxy solution).
 Down to the problem, had calls from users where they state that Outlook is failing to connect tot he Exchange server, Microsoft Teams reporting poor call quality, websites taking actual seconds to load. I have done all the checks on HQ side and all resource utilization across firewalls look O.K. No issues with Internet line saturation etc.
 I connected to one of the…</span>

                              <span>Hi there, my company is in the planning stages for a fairly significant roll-out of new hardware spread across our province. This is happening in the next 8-12 months.
 We will have ~3,500 locations and each location will be getting a minimum of 1 new device, some will be getting as many as 6 or 7 devices.
 The idea is on a certain date and time, all of these devices will be powered on in small window (1-4 hours) on a exact date. This is a regulatory requirement, so we can&#x27;t pre-load or delay load to these devices.
 Each device will have to download 1-5 files from our system hosted in AWS via one of two of our datacenters The files will be 10-20MB in size. We have a Direct Connect connection from both of our DC&#x27;s to AWS.
 ~2,800 of these sites use LTE and are on a private APN, they route to our 2 datacenters via MPLS circuits from our Telco. The speed at these sites averages between 15-20Mps.
 The remaining 700 or so sites use Internet, and route to our 2 datacenters via a pair of Internet circuits from different vendors. The speed at these sites is anywhere from 3Mbps (Satellite) up to 100+Mbps (Cable)
 Now to my question, I want to make sure our MPLS and Internet circuits (and AWS Direct Connect circuits) are scaled accordingly to support all of these downloads in this window. We want to make sure the downloads happen fairly quick (say less than say 10 minutes per device).
 Does anyone know of an online calulator that would help me do the math?
 I definitely plan on contacting our Telco to get their input, but I want to have some numbers (at least rough numbers) before engaging them to make sure they&#x27;re not making shit up.
 As you can imagine this is a very large and very important implementation (we&#x27;re on year 3 of the project) for my company and I want my portion (the network) to go as smoothly as possible.
 Any input would be muchly appreciated!

                              <span>About a month ago, I cut over from a sonicwall to a watchguard firewall for a customer. One of the interfaces is an uplink to a meraki router. Apparently the sonicwall had DHCP configured for this interface but I didn’t catch that when configuring the new firewall. So the cutover happens and all appears to be working fine in the environment. Until today. The customer lost power last night and thats when the meraki router was no longer reachable. I spent an hour on the phone with the vendor who manages the meraki troubleshooting what could be the issue. I was out of ideas until they mentioned that they are configured for DHCP and that’s when I realized I never set up a DHCP sever for the interface (because when do routers use DHCP? Is this standard practice or something now?) Anyways, I configured a small address pool and the router came back online. I’m just surprised that the router maintained its lease from the previous firewall for as long as it did. At least I’m assuming that’s how it was still able to function. Anyone experience anything similar?

                              <span>We have observed an issue in a rather complicated network but I am able to create a highly simplified model to demonstrate.
 A computer in the internal network (let’s call it “client”) accessing internet through a gateway computer. Client pinging to an IP will be interrupted after the gateway has changed the upstream route, and that will require the client computer to restart to recover.
 The “gateway” computer: Windows Server running RRAS (Routing and Remote Access Service). WAN interface has static IP and connects to the higher level gateway which eventually leads to internet. Also has a Demand-dial VPN connection to access internet as a second path. NAT is set up in RRAS to share these internet connections (one at a time) to the LAN interface.

                              <span>Hey everyone
 I&#x27;m doing a minor patch upgrade on a active/standby pair. I&#x27;ve done it in a lab environment and it seems pretty straightforward using the official Cisco guide.
 In a live environment, what show commands do you recommend I do before doing the upgrade?
 I&#x27;ve done it on switches before (sh cdp neighbours, show mac address-table, show up route, show vers, etc). What would be best practice for a firewall?
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hi all,
 New place I have started working at have a firewall with a less than optimal config. I am trying to get my head around it to make some improvements. They currently have a:
 Corporate Network (which I would like the VPN to be able to access) (10.*.*.*)
 VPN IP Range (172.1.*.*)
 Seperate Gateway VLAN (172.2.*.*) for servers they can access - these servers have an IP in both corporate and seperate VLAN, with gateway only entered on the seperate VLAN. This VLAN also has its own DNS which is what VPN clients are currently pointed to and provides the gateway VLAN ip address for these servers
 Issue is that people feel restricted, cant access file shares as if they were in work etc., have to remote on to an RDP server and productivity is suffering. My thoughts are that if the VPN is secure and has MFA in place, they can be considered secure enough to access all (or rather most - some is still locked behind other VLANs) corporate resources and work exactly as if they were in the office.
 So, to the issue - 
  
I have put a rule in place on the firewall to allow fully authenticated users access to the corporate VLAN.
 
I have updated the DNS on my computer to the corporate DNS. With this in place DNS works and I can ping ALL servers on the corporate VLAN except those with an IP address in both networks.
 
Pinging the other servers on their Gateway IP address works
 DNS gets the correct IP but I cant ping these on the corporate IP range.
 
 I suspect this is a routing and / or firewall issue but any pointers on where I should be looking would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hello all, I will try to explain my Problem. Switch DGS-1248T-48 LAN + 2 shared SFP Ports. After reset all ports working.
 VLAN 1 port 1 to 48.
 WEB-GUI access only port 25-48. Web access port 1-23 do not connect. 
 Although when I connect the router to port 1, only 1 - 23 are switching and connecting from/to internet
 Router to port 24, only 24-48 are switching and connecting from/to internet
 So it looks like 1-23 and 24-48 are somehow separated or not fully functional.
 Hardware, Software or Set-up Problem ?

                              <span>Can you suggest any network test equipment for a small service provider to do network maintenance on its network? The service provider&#x27;s network is IP/MPLS.
 Do simple traffic generators suffice for network maintenance? Do protocol load tests need to be performed on a regular basis as well? Perhaps a portable version of Ixia or Spirent equipment is necessary? Or a simple VIAVI or EXFO traffic generator do the most necessary things?
 Let me ask in this way: Are network field technicians just using simple portable ethernet traffic generators (VIAVI, EXFO,...) in their routine or are they using advanced state-of-the-art test equipment (Ixia or Spirent) to diagnose problems, like scalability problems with L3VPN services?

 It is required for the networks to create trust? Is this statement talking about firewalls, and how the networks need to trust the nodes(sensors) that are connected to that network?

                              <span>I&#x27;m at a loss. We have installed a new HVAC system and each of the 4 pieces of equipment has an internal IP (statically configured - no DHCP). The HVAC vendor has specialized (and very expensive) software in his laptop that is needed in order to configure/troubleshoot/etc.
 The request is to provide him remote access to prevent the cost and travel time for him to come to the location. I am using an Ubiquiti UDM-Pro router and created a VPN. I can add desktops to this VPN (including his), but there is no way (that I know) to add those 4 pieces of equipment to this VPN network just by configuring their NICs.
 I considered creating a VLAN with or without its own public IP. That would add all the HVAC equipment on its own private subnet, but would run into the same issue on how to give his remote workstation access to this IP network? I can only think of a way to VPN the router itself given the limitations I have to change the equipment at hand.
 Hopefully I am missing something obvious. Tks in advance.

                              <span>Hi.
 We are expanding our datacenter with another datacenter about 100m apart from our main DC.
 Our current network design is that our mainbuilding (DC-1) has a core firewall/router with dual ISPs and ROAS directly to access switches. It also has direct connection to our ICS-network firewalls (for temporary RDP-access from internet) which in turn also is Router on a stick down to the ICS access switches.
 So basically theres only a core layer and an access layer.
 The new building (DC-2) will have its own subnets and networks, but will need to be connected to DC-1 since the SCADA-server is there.
 THe buildings will have a lot of fibers between them. I was thinking of placing 2x L3 switches in each building (instead of core direct access to access layer) with redudant links to each core FW in DC-1. So basically sharing the core layer between the DCs, but a separate distribution layer in each building.
 I am by no means a network expert, but has some experience. Unfortunately i&#x27;ve been asked to fix something between the DCs. Appreaciate any tips!

We got the new cert about 2 weeks ago, just before Thanksgiving. I meant to work on getting it imported sooner, but we had some things come up in the meantime, so I didn&#x27;t get a chance to start working on it until 2:30pm Friday afternoon.
 I followed the guide here: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/wireless/catalyst-9800-series-wireless-controllers/213917-generate-csr-for-third-party-certificate.html
 I had to use OpenSSL to generate the CSR for the SAN entries, since SAN entries are not avalable on the WLC CSR prior to v17.8.1. Since the CSR was not generated by the WLC, this meant that the cert needed to be imported to the WLC as a PKCS12 file with t…</span>

                              <span>Hello Networking Community, 
 Looking for some of your opinions / recommendations for installing PhPIPAM in terms of hardware. I work for a large global enterprise who is largely currently using excel to track IP&#x27;s. Long term strategy is to bring in a enterprise grade IPAM (Efficent IP, Infoblox, etc) but in the meantime (until we can get budget) we need to get some sort of sane way (not excel) to track IP&#x27;s across a very large global org. Enter PhPIPAM. 
 I am working on getting a RHEL server built to install this on but for the life of me cannot find any sort of recommendations on hardware. I know it does not require much in terms of CPU/Mem but definitely do not want to undershoot it and have performance issues down the road. 
 Any opinions / suggestions? 
 Thanks.

 I am looking for information what mobility management function exactly mean. For me as a someone who spent the almost whole life with math, function means an expression, rule, or law that defines a relationship between one variable and another variable, equation with x, y,z
 In network theory it seems, it has different meaning.
 Can someone explain what network function for mobility management mean or look like?

It should come as an some kind an agent type and should have a possibility to be installed in Linux VMs.
 All the traceroute results should be able to be seen in some kind of one centralized location
  
Maybe someone could recommend tool for that ? It could commercial or free. Till now I&#x27;ve been using the product called Pingplotter - it allows you to install remote agents in your DC and see the results in centralized location. But that remote agent traceroute capability is quite legacy one and not supported anymore - so there&#x27;re bugs which is annoying. Also - they have a new product called Pingplotter Cloud - that should do the job - but the pricing model is different, will gonna try the trial version. Also - i would like to get some input from you - if there&#x27;re other tools for that job. Thanks !!

 Currently the main network infrastructure consists of a 2921 series router (cisco) and two procurve switches. I&#x27;ve got the ability to put different devices into different vlans obviously, but I&#x27;ve done a little bit of research and determined that it&#x27;s possible to break out of it, pretty easily.
 Is there a proprietary solution available for this, or is there a better solution using readily available networking principles to achieve it?

 Is there software that will let me use my Hack RF or an RTL-SDR to monitor the full Wi-Fi spectrum like a WiFi-spy does?
 I&#x27;d like to avoid paying thousands of dollars, especially since I don&#x27;t have many clients yet, AND I already have hardware that&#x27;s likely better than the hardware in their WiFi-Spy device.
 I&#x27;ve tried normal SDR apps, but you can usually only see about 20MHz at a time, because it&#x27;s trying to capture the signal at real-time, which isn&#x27;t needed for diagnosing Wi-Fi.
 Someone&#x27;s gotta have done this already, right?!

                              <span>Hey experts, fiber noob here. We have 2 buildings connected via single mode fiber. Both ends terminate on a fiber distribution panel on the rack. (Both sides)
 Rack &gt;Fiber panel &gt; building a &gt; single mode ------ bulding b  multimode sfp &gt; fiber panel 
 Reason I ask is because customer thinks single mode sfp are too expensive. If not, is there any other way to make it work?

Ended up getting an instance in Montreal. Wondering if anyone else had a similar experience/had any insight.

                              <span>I work in a small team supporting a large HPC cluster, and because we’re a small team we rely on support contracts via our hardware vendors to ship out replacement parts and send out service techs to our data centers to fix them.
 Trying to get techs on site to fix hardware is borderline impossible compared to pre-2020. I have to follow up dozens of times to get techs out after repeated no-shows.
 We’re a Lenovo shop and that means most hardware support is done by IBM, (some part of the Byzantine IBM/Lenovo deal back in the day I’m sure). I’m not sure if this is just usual pain from IBM circling the drain or if other people are noticing this with different vendors as well? Lenovo is great at shipping out the parts but getting the tech on site is simply not happening anymore which really reduces the value of the warranty imo.
 What are your experiences with getting vendor hardware support? Are you all having better experiences with Dell or HPE?

                              <span>I am trying to create a solution to allow users to work from home and the amount of solutions for the unexperienced is a little overwhelming. Basically we run our own local AD and I want to have virtual desktops that users can remote in to from home. I started the process with the windows solution and there will be a lot of pieces, session hosts, gateways, certificates, firewall port forwarding etc for a user base that isn&#x27;t very large and I am wondering if there is a simpler option to just have 10 virtual desktops available if people need to work from home. I do not want to have the remote desktop tool installed on their physical machines at work. I also don&#x27;t want to assign a specific VM to a user, they should just automatically connect to a VM in the pool. Any recommendations or suggestions are much appreciated.

 I&#x27;ve been working with CDW for a while now and generally not had too many issues, but over the last month our rep and their sales team has become basically non-responsive.
 I am looking for a good vendor for HPE and Dell Servers, Aruba Networking and Palo Alto Networking.
 Any recommendations on what vendors are good?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Good Afternoon Everyone,
 I&#x27;m currently tasked with researching new possibilities to upgrading our current storage solutions to better fit our future and development.
 A little background on our data. We accumulate around 4PBs of data per year or so and that data rarely gets purged or removed. It is usually acquired in 2 GB files, TBs at a time. (20+ TBs per collection).
 This data gets processed on local machines or GPU/CPU clusters.
 Data is stored raw and processed.
 We currently use JBOD raids but we&#x27;ve found that with data storage being in the PBs, we are setting up new PB raids every few years or so and essentially &quot;upgrading&quot; them means rebuilding with new HDDs or just buying a whole new rack/raid. We also have an insane amount of file shares because of each raid.
 Would a scale out solution like CEPH or GlusterFS be a better solution? Would we be better off keeping RAID configurations? What other solutions could provide for this?
 I had a hard time wrapping my head around which solution would be best because of I/O density/etc.
 We aren&#x27;t against vendor supported builds but would prefer to learn and grow our experiences in storage to provide direct support later down the road and grow our professional portfolios.
 Funding and time aren&#x27;t huge issues, and we&#x27;ve been given some funds to build a small &quot;proof of concept&quot; for whichever system we can find that fits the criteria. This would include training/etc.

                              <span>Noticed our Barracuda email gateway went down. Was told this was due to their cloud provider. Looked into AWS and found they were having an outage. Seems this is taking out many different products.

                              <span>We have a user who is moving departments. Normally, we would just change their folder permissions and distribution lists and call it a day. They&#x27;d keep their same email address and login. We run our own Windows active domain and exchange servers.
 The problem is that this user has lots of emails that they should no longer have access to in their new position. Is there a way to transfer their mailbox to their old supervisor without making a whole new user/email? 
 Right now our solution is just to create a whole new user with a new email and give their old supervisor access to their mailbox. However that just feels clunky. Is there a more elegant one?
 What is the best practice for lateral moves like this?
 Thank you for your help!

                              <span>I have 2 years of experience as a Sysadmin, 5 years total in IT. Mostly dealing with Windows, AD, GPOs, some O365, and some work with CI/CD pipelines, Jenkins, and Rancher. I also have an AA, and am learning Linux and Python on the side.
 I recently got a new job as an Automation Specialist but was laid off 3 months in due to budget. I&#x27;ve been looking for jobs for 1.5 months now, and still don&#x27;t have one.
 As far as interviews go, I&#x27;ve gotten:
 15 1st interviews with HR/Recruiters
 5 2nd Interviews
 2 3rd+ Interviews
 My question is, is this normal? I know it&#x27;s not a good time of year to find a job, and the layoffs nationally make competing for full remote jobs difficult. There&#x27;s unfortunately not a lot going on in my city for jobs at the moment, especially with my limited experience. 
 I&#x27;m wondering if I should attribute this to &#x27;hard time for jobs&#x27;, or if I&#x27;m actually doing something wrong. I feel overqualified for Desktop Support jobs, but underqualified for System Engineer jobs.

                              <span>Captive Portals always seem to be problematic for Guest WiFi. Often times the captive portal page doesn&#x27;t launch, certificate issues seem to come up a lot, or people who use a VPN to log into their computer get completely hosed. So many of these just have people click Accept or at best an email address that is rarely validated. In those cases, is there really enough value to them to make it worth causing people difficulties connecting?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been thinking on my career, and how I&#x27;m now in a job where I am just a caretaker of hardware and do some minor admin duties, but paid more than I ever have been, and how some of the most active jobs I&#x27;ve had were both the lowest paying and most stressful, but some of those were also the most fun. I looked back on the older jobs I&#x27;ve had, and I keep getting into jobs where I am doing less and less of what is in my skillset, and in some cases less actual work, while getting paid more, as I get older and gain skills. 
 I miss the days when I was managing the virtual architecture, making and managing the VMs, architecting AD, DNS, DHCP, and WDS, doing the backups, checking everything out in the morning and doing things all day long. I miss the troubleshooting days of desktop support, where I had some mysterious problem and had to actually figure out what was going wrong and fix it, rather than just wipe machines and start them over. I actually miss the days when my workload took up most of my day, but I sure don&#x27;t miss the crap pay I&#x27;d get for it. 
 Why do you suppose this is? Why is the pay for doing the most work so much lower than jobs where the workload is so much less? Has anyone else encountered this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently working as Helpdesk Support for a massive corporate gaming company (6,000+ employees).
 I&#x27;m very comfortable in my job, and whilst the role is basic, the benefits are great.
 I am the only IT in the office of 150 users, and my manager is based in another country. So I report to no one in person. 
 I have my own office, with direct access to a roof terrace where I can enjoy fresh air, coffee and a view. My office has a fully catered kitchen, where we are provided fresh food and cooked meals daily. They pay for my medical insurance, gym membership and pension. The employees are great people that I get on with very well too. 
 But here&#x27;s the hitch...
 I&#x27;ve been offered 25% increase on my salary by an oil company. This company, whilst paying considerably more, do not offer these little perks. No free food, no gym, no nice view, and my desk would be in the middle of the main office.
 They would also expect me to be able to assist outside of normal hours, and even on occasion, do jobs that would not normally fall under the scope of work for Helpdesk support.
 My conundrum is do I stay where I am, in a big, comfortable, established company with all of these benefits, or risk it all for 25% pay increase? 
 What would you do?

                              <span>Hi, how do you all handle backups of object stores? From the viewpoint of an end user of object storage, not as a provider.
 For example, we host an application that uses object store as it&#x27;s backend, and we would like to backup the files in the object store, preferably the backup should land in object store as well (using block storage for backup would defeat the cost advantages of using object store in the first place).
 One option I found was using rlcone to synchronize all the contents to a different object store, however this is slow, and does not easily provide files from X days ago.
 How do you handle this problem at your organization? Or is this a killer argument against using object store at all for you?
 Curious to hear, and thanks already :)

                              <span>I have setup a mirrored storage space using 3x4TB HDDs and 1x8TB HDD totaling 4 HDDs. I will keep 4 SATA slots for the pool, 1 for the OS SSD and 1 extra as a temp slot, so would just like to ask a few question to confirm my understanding.
 Question 1:
 The useable pool size is 18.1 TB, so am I correct to assume 9TB would be usable?
 Is the 9 TB of data distributed across the 4 drives, so that there are always 2 copies?
 What I&#x27;m afraid of is that I do not have full redundancy across 9TB of data do to the uneven number of TBs relative to HDDs.
 Question 2:
 If I was to purchase a new 8TB drive can I easily removed a 4TB drive from the pool?
 So I would end up with 2x4TB and 2x8TB, pool size would be ~24TB with usable space ~12TB?

                              <span>Hi all. Just wondering if there are any H1-B (or other US based visa) employees on here? 
 I&#x27;m a UK citizen contracting to fairly large banks and insurance companies in London trying to move myself and my family (wife and 2 kids) to the US, preferably somewhere like Florida, so was just seeing if there was anyone here with a similar story?
 I’ve got 15 years experience and have run infrastructure teams in the past.
 Thanks Sav

 What&#x27;s everyone&#x27;s favorite 3rd party tools for completing migrations? Recently, I heard of a software that you can drop on workstations to configure Outlook after the cutover. Has anyone used this?
 Any tips are appreciated!

                              <span>We have a LoB app that uses the %TEMP% location to save attachment content for emails. User clicks task in the app, a %TEMP%/123/45678.pdf is created (both 123 folder, and 45678.pdf). Once done the app seems to rename the contract_90123.pdf. effective permissions also show full access for this location.
 That rename appears to be intermittently failing, so the expected attachment isnt present and the email fails to generate. procmon shows &#x27;path not found&#x27; on the rename operation.
 From the information i&#x27;ve gathered so far, it&#x27;s an infrequent failure but when it happens appears to occur for a period of time. We appear to be fine for a week but last week we had it occur for all generated email attachments and was 100% reproducable.
 The infra is RDS2019 (6 servers) using UPD&#x27;s, which runs on S2D storage. %TEMP% was not originally included in the UPD but as of an hour ago now included for testing. I doubt that will have any fix due. There&#x27;s no apparent heavy resource usage or noticable performance issues when the issue occurs to suspect heavy load.
 We seem to have no other issues on the RDS&#x27;s other than this rename operation failing. Running the app locally also has no problems. LoB support say it&#x27;s an issue with our environment and with it only occuing on our RDS&#x27;s, i&#x27;m inclined to beleive them.
 Any sugestions on what to do to further diagnose this one? due to the seeming isolated file, i&#x27;m out of ideas as anything i can come up with (eg: bad disk/ram/network) would affect far more than this.

                              <span>I have been out of the game for about 5 years because I started a construction company. Now, with the market and interest rates, projects are harder to find and the margins are getting slimmer.
 Before I started my company I was a sysadmin for a municipality with specialized certification for windows servers and CCNA. Now my certifications are invalid and I&#x27;m thinking of renewing certs. But I still want to have my own company and work as a consultant.
 My question is, in what area is there a lack of competence or highly sought after? I was thinking of getting certs for Azure and Office 365 with powershell and SharePoint. Is that a good way to go?
 I live in Europe where it&#x27;s more common to get a salary job than being an independent consultant.

                              <span>Hi all I know its a dinosaur but. This server was running great last week. No changes onboard. I cant get to the logs, as system does not make it through loading Bios. I get no front panel codes, no beeps, just a repeating attemt to load bios. Ran for years prior to this with regular cleaning and maintenance. Other machines on the same lan are running fine on same os. 2012R2. Both power supplies are good. Full boat ram, was raid1. No serveices active, was mining monero well with no temperature issues. Opened the case and no evil smells, no dust bunnies etc all looks good. Any help?

                              <span>Looking to get some input from those that wish to do so.
 How do you &#x27;manage&#x27; permission changes to folder structures in SharePoint Online?
 We currently ask that users create a ticket requesting access with a link to what they need - IT then get authorisation from manager.
 Or we ask authorised managers to request it for a user.
 This is so we have a log of permission changes, this log of request/authorisation needs to stay put of course, along with the auditable actions by IT.
 It&#x27;s just of a PITA right? We get loads of requests per day, wondering how other organisations make these changes as they scale and grow as an organisation?
 Just to add, I am looking at implementing PIM/Identify Governance using security groups as a way to combat it, anyone use this for SharePoint permissions? Advice on its implementation? Best ways to allow users to know which groups are for which folders?

                              <span>Sometimes an user will suffer an IT related issue, and somehow from the symptoms presented and their limited knowledge will formulate an answer by &quot;filling in the gaps&quot; and coming up with 2+2 &#x3D; orange.
 My favourite example of this was a few years ago at a small office where filesharing was dealt with by a Dell Poweredge server, and wifi was dealt with using a few cheap APs. One day the server&#x27;s PSU fell over, and while one on-site tech was fixing it the office manager/company director asked &quot;has the server failed because there&#x27;s too much WiFi?&quot;. It took every fibre of my being to respond &quot;no, that&#x27;s not how it works&quot; with a straight face
 Another was a chap who couldn&#x27;t log in to one of our AzureAD workstations. His hypothesis? &quot;I&#x27;m logged in to my laptop at my desk so the system obviously won&#x27;t let me log in to two systems at once&quot;. The actual reason was he&#x27;d got his account password wrong...

                              <span>We chatted back and forth for 30 minutes, the dude was pretty chill and he asked me basics about me (where am i from, my academic degrees, told him about myself)...
 He asked me simple questions after that, such as the definition of DNS, kernel, OSI model... I answered most of it but he told me that i still need to give it a revision, and go for a technical test in a couple of days. 
 The test will consist on a google form with questions related to my position, so it&#x27;s all about collecting information here and there i guess..
 If i pass that test, i will jump to the technical interview which is probably the hardest part of the whole process. I&#x27;m not sure if i can make it since i barely got any experience or knowledge in cloud computing overall. I&#x27;m also not sure about what are they looking for exactly since you jump to their formation program even if u nail all the interviews, i&#x27;m not sure if i can make it to that point just with a few days of studying basic stuff.
 What would you guys suggest me?

 Sometimes the icon image also changes to the &#x27;This PC&#x27; icon image but when right clicking you can still see it is registered to the origianl application.
 Tried all the usual icon cache related fixes but can&#x27;t work out the fault or even what causes the taskbar icons to corrupt in the first place.

                              <span>Hi all, I have an odd situation:
 Two systems with identical group policy settings.
 Event log behaviour is differenct between Windows 10 and Windows 11
 The setting is question is Event Viewer &gt; Windows Logs &gt; Security &gt; right-click &gt; Properties
 Windows 10 defaults to &quot;Overwrite events as needed&quot;
 Windows 11 defaults to &quot;Do not overwrite events&quot;
 This is a problem because when security event log fills up, system won&#x27;t accept non-administrative logons.
 Running gpresult /h , the only event log settings I can see are
 Settings/Policies/Windows Settings/Security Settings/Event Log
 and there&#x27;s nothing relevant here: both are set to &#x27;retain by days&#x27; and &#x27;retain for 30 days&#x27;.
 Does any one have any ideas?
 Thanks!

 can i get windows users &amp; passwords in a text file?
  
I&#x27;m a junior dev at a small startup, so I&#x27;m doing a lot of stuff I know basically nothing about. We got these small servers called zima boards, and I think they&#x27;re supposed to be endpoints to kiosks and stuff, maybe get sensor data or shit like that idk they just threw me a box, rattled on about some bullshit I didn&#x27;t understand(I heard mqtt so it&#x27;s probably gonna be stuff like that) and said &quot;have fun&quot;. I know they said &quot;we need to get windows on it because the users and passwords would be a burden to change&quot; or something like that, and I heard a conversation which mentioned that we&#x27;re gonna be doing like 50 of these at a time, so I&#x27;m guessing my task is to figure out how to install windows on these without having to interact with each one first.
 My second question to anyone who knows windows, is it possible to get the users &amp; passwords in a text file? That would mean we wouldn&#x27;t have to install windows to begin with, and since it comes with a debian based distro we can just bash some bullshit together to create the users.
 oooh wait, is it possible to run a script with grub(somehow, haven&#x27;t done it before) to get it to boot there? If so, then I could just run a script to install grub(if not installed), reboot, then run a script which selects the device(maybe? idk all the commands to do that but it seems reasonable right?)

 I have a Dell Powerstore SAN coming in Q1 2023 with a Dell Servers cluster, and would like to have a lab for teaching and training better understand concepts and issues related to San based hyper cluster environment. What is your recommendations for a test lab setup related to ebay hardware to test this out.

                              <span>What do these two plugins: Microsoft Edge Browser Version Detection and Apache HTTP Server Version check to determine the versions of their respective softwares during a credentialed scan?
 The output for the Edge plugin shows a path, implying that the plugin looks in certain directories for Edge installations - but does it ony search through &quot;C:\Program...&quot; or does it search the whole drive for any installations of Edge? 
 Similarly, the Apache plugin outputs a URL &quot;http://abc.def/:80&quot; with the port, suggesting that&#x27;s where the server instance is hosting a web-page. But does it only query the web-page and pull the Apache version that way or is there more going on under the hood?
 I&#x27;m not able to find any .nasl script files for these plugins either, so if you could point me to a resource where these exist, that&#x27;d help too.

                              <span>Hi,
 We&#x27;ve noticed a increase in amount of users with issues surrounding the office apps, mostly Excel and Outlook 2016/2019. When the user is trying to save the attachment Outlook hangs for a bit or completely crashes, same with Excel - user sometimes cannot even put anything in a row/line, the app just hangs.Right now I&#x27;m trying to figure something out, I thought maybe you guys had similiar problems and maybe some fixes for previous problems would work this time around.We tried both repairing and reinstalling the Office, turning off hardware acceleration in Outlook, deleting outlook profile, starting outlook as admin, launching outlook without addons, disabling &quot;scroll inactive windows...&quot; option, increasing the allowed cache file size. No improvements unfortunately. OS in most cases is Windows 11 however the problem started around a week or two ago.

                              <span>As we know, Windows 2012 will end of support on October 10, 2023. So my company requests to upgrade these servers to Windows 2019. 
 I&#x27;m looking for any tool/solution that can support this case.
 These systems do not have DC or AD functions, just install the company software and 3rd-party tools.
 Could I use Veam Backup as the solution to migrate? Or any other solution ?

I&#x27;m looking for a 10Meter, fiber if possible version of that but can&#x27;t finy any, HPE only sells a 3Meter version of that. I&#x27;m thinking of using a SFP-like module, thats why i want to know how the connector is called.
 Thanks!

Keep in mind that we don&#x27;t really have many inside jokes, or anything like that, so make sure your gift is universal and can be given to any sys admin, so that other people reading the comments of this post can also get inspired.

Mainly working with failover clustering, lots of VM work, some low level and high level trouble shooting seting up new hypervisors, exchange servers, client devices, GPOs in AD, setting up HA for RDP servers etc built the office a new rack many cut fingers. 
 Currently having a world of fun with SCOM and SCCM.
 We are a small company so being hands on with everything is amazing and I&#x27;m surprised how much you really get to do in a smaller company.
 Is it normal to be doing this stuff so early, and is it a bad thing? I&#x27;m doing some Microsoft certs is there more I should be doing?

                              <span>Hello all!
 I have been reading a lot about PKI and moreover Active Directory Certification Services.
 I have some questions:
 - What is the difference between OCSP and CDP? What is the best scenario to have one or the other?
 - Does OCSP respond if the current client certificate is valid? Is this statement valid for regular CRL CDP as well? How do clients knows to check the ocsp? Is it embedded on the certificate as an AIA point?
 - I have noticed that when setting up the AIA you always point it to the root CA certificate, why is that? Regular CDP point to .crl files but not AIA.
 - If I don&#x27;t set up a custom IIS server with CRL, do clients pull it from default points such as LDAP? is IIS custom CDP best practice for DMZ external clients where LDAP is not accessible? why CRLs cannot be accessed through HTTPS?
 - What is the objective of using multiple SANs in a certificate?
 - What are the considerations when migrating CAs to other servers? Does it work by backing up old CA, turn off the server CA, create the new one, install role, restore CA registry backup but manitaining IP and server name? Would that keep the default CDP and AIA settings as well as matching DNS zone records. What about the IIS servers hosting enrollment and CDPs if any? What about the NDES role if it is present?
 - Can I change renewal key lenght on capolicy.inf if certificates are required to increase key length? Is there another way to do it? What tasks are needed to be done after that?
 - What is Certificate Transparency what are CT logs? How does ADCS implements it?
 What is a CAA NS record, and how does Microsoft implements it in DNS or ADCS?
 I&#x27;d be thanking anyone who can help on answerings these questions as I am really curious about the topic.

                              <span>We recently got a new batch of dell computers, i have the unfortunate task of imaging these laptops as we couldn&#x27;t get autopilot set up in time :(.
 To image the devices we usually boot to an &quot;active disk image&quot; USB and plug our external hard drive that contains the image.
 The issue we have is that we cannot select the internal SSD as the destination disk, although this has worked on previous Dell computers. The first thought it that it would be related to secure boot but i have had no success after turning this off.
 If anyone could point me in the right direction that would be much appreciated.

                              <span>Hi all,
 One of our users are facing login failure issues on the VPN client, I checked the logs in the VPN box and it states kerberos_kinit_password: KDC has no support for encryption. Any idea what can be done here? In the AD&#x27;s user, they ticked supported for AES 128 AND 256 inorder to avoid the issue of KDC error when upon logging to remote desktop. Side note, we&#x27;re using sonicwall&#x27;s SMA 410 VPN appliance.

                              <span>Curious to see what everyone uses to build out tools for IT to use to interact with your services. 
 Ex. We use Powershell Universal, but it&#x27;s just buggy enough and their support was useless/ refused to assist and closed my cases.
 I like to provide self services methods to look up data such as dhcp reservations or dns records, remediate accounts, block url&#x27;s, etc. When possible I give least privilege to people, but in a Microsoft cloud, they&#x27;re getting tooled to death so I like providing a one stop shop.
 Just curious what other alternatives yall have found that are stable and aren&#x27;t a huge constant time sink.

 Clients have Outlook ost files that would syncing with Exchange on their local machines. How do setup the new M365 on these clients because the &quot;onmicrosoft&quot; is dropped and it is now just username&gt;@.com? I wish to be able to have users have all their past emails available to them in the new mailbox. How do I set up their profiles then do this type of import/merge?

                              <span>Haven’t worked directly with AD directly for a while, so these are probably newbie questions.
 If I have a single DC on 2012 OS, with 2008 r2 functional level forest/domain, and I’d like to add a secondary DC (to replace one that recently failed), I don’t see a place in the instruction steps where he functional level is specified when adding the second DC. I’m assuming that this is bc the second dc will just replicate off the first one, but is this a safe assumption? 
 I’ve learned not to assume much when working with MS, so I looked for docs online that specified whether this is fine going from, say, the current OS-functional level combo to, say, 2016 OS with the same 2008 r2 functional level, but I can’t seem to find it. At some point with the newer os’s, won’t I encounter one(like 2019, 2022?) that won’t recognize or allow the new server to become a secondary dc to the existing primary one running such an old functional level? TIA!

 Until recently I would get 20 or more results and now I only get 10.
 Has anyone noticed their companies stop hiring or not replacing people who leave? 
 If so, wondering what type of industries have been slowing the pace of hiring?

                              <span>Hi, I have no SCCM for 100 Windows servers. In the past i used a end point management tool from manage engine. Now i am only allowed to use Microsoft software and WSUS. Branch offices are receiving updates directly from MS via reg key. I guess the task scheduler is not save to use because of several viruses. Do you have a powershell script which restarts and reports like the software patchbatch? Restart via csv file an remotePowershell is easy. But logging and uninstall and mail reports when everything worked or not will be hard. There are also some cmdlets with useful functions, but i am not sure which one is trustful and how to deploy on all servers.

                              <span>I’m a junior studying CIS, it’s part of the business college at my university. What type of certs would be my greatest asset to have? I only have 5 CIS classes the rest is business related. I have applied to some internships. Just waiting to hear back. My goal is to become a system admin before studying MIS in the masters degree. Thanks for any advice.

                              <span>Dears, i have two workstations that i need users to render their projects on it instead of rendering on their desktops, i tried multiple ways to try sending render jobs from user pc to workstations but it doesn&#x27;t work
 i tried Pandora and it&#x27;s full of errors &amp; lack support on the internet, also tried vray but it&#x27;s taking almost the same time when rendering on user pc which is not a good sign
 i&#x27;m searching for free software to create this task and make it work, any ideas?

                              <span>Since our spam filters are very busy this time of year I started on this (A wonderful time of the year tune).
 It is a very busy time of the year. We have spammers aplenty and everyone telling you, &quot;You need click here&quot; It is a very busy time of the year.
 It&#x27;s the scam spammiest season of all With those holiday emails and sad sappy tails That’s how spammers are coming to call It&#x27;s the scam spammiest season of all
 Those emails are posting your PII and boasting that you are not in the know There&#x27;ll be scary scam stories and tales of the queries That warn of the scams long ago
 It is a very busy time of the year. There&#x27;ll be much user tricking And a lot of link clicking While IT watches in fear It is a very busy time of the year.

                              <span>Hello admins, after the first few years in the job, I am currently considering how I can organize myself better. I know there are various tools, but somehow this is not really effective so far. I sometimes find it difficult to focus and &quot;forget&quot; something that I only remember some time later. The goal is better time management. It works so far rather semi well. Information/tasks come via various channels and I would like to manage this for myself in one tool(best cross platform). 
 Tried Task,ToDo,OneNote,Google Keep…. but hasn&#x27;t really worked for me so far.
 Now the question to you, what and how do you use tools to organize your daily work and projects and not lose focus?
 Thank you all and have a nice Sunday.

                              <span>That&#x27;s my job, literally my entire job. 
 Just spent 13 hrs yesterday trying to migrate never patched VMs from 2013 and get them to boot up on Azure. Not just that the client wants their disks to be BitLocker encrypted, that was 6 hrs of screen-sharing &amp; logs sharing with the Critical Situation support team from Azure. 
 All this in a fixed time-frame, if a VM doesn&#x27;t migrate - it has direct monetary impact on the project. Which leads to every hour updates, extreme levels of micro-management; hell the only time I got up was to piss, 3 times in 13 hrs. 
 My team is made up of 4 recent graduates(almost good for nothing at the moment), 1 team lead who disappears when he is needed, 2 engineers who can&#x27;t write a single line of powershell if their life depended on it. And then there&#x27;s me, I have written SOPs for every single action that needs to be performed, have automated over 120 minutes worth of manual configurations; I lead the migration, fix other&#x27;s mistakes, deal with app owners and their bs expectations. I deal with the curt/narcissitic MDs of my company, while my manager makes sure everything &quot;looks good&quot;, because things need not be good, they just gotta look good.
 tldr; V2V/server rehosting is stupid, do not do it. Just build a new VM and install your shit on it.

My current server is currenly runing a MySQL server and web servers (NGINX/APACHE). I want to upgrade the server and wanted to know what specs would give me a good amount of wiggleroom for growth.
 My current specs are: 
 4 CPU
 8GB Ram
 50GB SSD
 ​
 is this a good amount of what specific parts should i be looking at? I&#x27;m using DigitalOcean by the way.

I am going to work with two guys one them is a senior. We are going to work on cloud infrastructure, o365 stuff, Ms Azure / AWS. 
 Just wanted to ask you guys what advise can you give me to have a good start as I don&#x27;t want to mess up.

 Your software should support 465 and optionally 587 – implicit TLS via submissions over port 465 is where we&#x27;re moving to, according to RFC 8314 from 2018.
 Dunno about everyone else, but I was definitely under the impression that STARTTLS on 587 was the widely deployed &quot;better&quot; option. Seems like it&#x27;s just widely deployed where implicit TLS should be.
 Happy SNI sounds, because multiplexing SMTP traffic sucks otherwise.

                              <span>I am building a file downloader using c# httpclient which downloads files from an asp.net IIS server. My test is downloading 46GB of data spread out over about 40k files, done by about 4k instances of the downloader process (this is done in a build system, so each instance of the downloader is run/cached separately,). This works out to an average of 10 files downloaded per httpclient instance and an.average of 1MB per file.
 Everything works fine until minute 4, when suddenly my download speed goes to 0. I have a timeout of 1 minute on the process and 5 attempts are made to download each file. About 2 minutes after the stalled downloads, it starts back up again. This is after the first two attempts timed out. The server logs show that it didn&#x27;t even seem to receive the request that was being asked of it, and when it did receive a request, the server claims it handled it quickly.
 So far to troubleshoote I have tried to increase the dynamic port range, and limit the number of requests being sent at once to 75. Still this happens pretty deterministically around the 3-5 minute mark.
 Is there something I can check and try to figure out why it is stalling? I know Wireshark can be a useful tool, but I don&#x27;t really know what I am looking for in this case. Thanks!

                              <span>I run a small WISP and am moving to Mikriotik HAP line for user routers. I have a big goal to eventually set up a mechanism to redirect past due clients to a &quot;Hey, pay your bill&quot; web page.
 Originally, I was trying to make this a function of DHCP with classes for user MACs that are active or suspended. Active clients will be given an IP on a subnet that is allowed out via NAT permit policy, wheras suspended MACs would be placed on a subnet not allowed out to the internet and has all DNS queries pointing to the IP of my web server (via bind9 views one using normal DNS forwarding and the other pointing to a local dnsmasq instance) with rewrite rules to my &quot;pay your bill&quot; page.
 This ALMOST worked, but when you have multiple IPs on one VLAN, one IP must be the primary IP and that put a halt to anything working. This was because the relay agent will always use the primary IP for the relay agent IP to determine which pool to grant an IP from. I can get a device from active to suspended if the suspended IP is the default, but it will not go back since the relay agent IP will always be the primary IP on the VLAN.
 This led me to consider RADIUS, since you can use Framed-IP-Address to reassign an IP.
 I have a working baseline FreeRADIUS server set up that accepts usernames, passwords and secrets and correctly responds. It is backed by MySQL. I can figure out mac-auth and the rest but I need to know how to make the HAPs authenticate themselves once they get on the network.
 The imagined flow would be DHCP on the primary (suspended) subnet. Radius processes if the MAC is active or not. If it is not it will stay on the suspended subnet. If the MAC is active RADIUS will provide an IP on the secondary (active) subnet.
 Is there a way to make what I am aiming for work?

I know what they do and why they are sent but why is it important to keep track of every byte sent out by the host?

                              <span>Recently ordered some HP i210 adapters from Amazon (shipped and sold by) and have a suspicion they are fake. Label says made in Thailand and the CE on that sticker seems correct. Mfg date is 08/2022. They don&#x27;t have any holo stickers on them (yottamark or bradyId) and the crystal does not say TXC. Are these still indicators of an authentic intel card on the i210? Doesn&#x27;t seem to be much info out there about this model as most guides focus on the i350.

                              <span>Hello,
 I got some reports one our our remote networks has been running a little slow. 
 I ran a packet monitor on the locations SonicWall and saw an insane amount of ARP requests, all coming from the same MAC which I&#x27;ve identified as the Modem for that location. The ARP requests are NOT for our network, so the SonicWall is dropping them. All of the ARP requests are sourced and destined for IP&#x27;s in our ISP&#x27;s range (WOW). In about 30 seconds we&#x27;ll drop a little over 5000 ARP packets. I was originally investigating an OSPF issue when I found this. Could this be a routing issue on our part, or does this seem like the ISP is at fault? I&#x27;ve called them twice now and its been very unhelpful. 
 Thanks in advance. I appreciate any help.

                              <span>Hi! :)
 I recently read in an article, that ISPs could determine if the user uses tethering, so if the packet originated from a PC/Laptop rather than from the phone itself because the phone would use a different TTL than the connected device.
 Is this true? Would my phone use a different TTL for its packets than my Linux/MacOS/Windows device? Respectively is the TTL dependent of the used OS?
 Or did the website mean, that my phone would represent another hop in the network so that the packets would have a lower TTL? (Couldn&#x27;t it just be that the packet went randomly another hop?)

                              <span>Hi,
 Could you please help me, I&#x27;m a new sysadmin on my companie, We bought a new app that is deployed on a local server, I want to give SSH Acces to the support team of the app who are outside of my network.
 I thought about portforwarding to SSH Port I don&#x27;t know if it is safe. Someone told me about a VPN but I don&#x27;t know how to configure it.
 - I have a fixed public address.
 - I have a Cyberoam firewall 
 NB: I don&#x27;t have credentials to access the server.
 Thank you. 
 Sorry for my bad english it&#x27;s my 3rd language.

The company is facing legal consequences as tens of billions in digital assets have been wiped out — and around $2 billion in client funds are still unaccounted for.

 What I noticed was that the download speed was very fast! yes, faster than my internet speed and I didn&#x27;t have up to 800MB as my data balance but the file was still downloaded completely. 
 Is my mobile/wifi data only used to maintain the ssh connection? That is not to disconnect.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 Been in end-user support as a field technician for about 2 years and spoke to my boss about wanting to transition into system admin/active directory and go on the cybersec pathway for climbing up. Company owner agreed to reserve the next trainee position for me and we&#x27;ll be meeting up next week to be discussing the terms of the position etc.
 For some background, recently I asked the company owner for a letter of good faith to be released to one of our contractees as a employee in an attempt to move upwards, however was turned down for lack of experience, which is where he offered me training and a junior system admin position. He&#x27;s been very accommodating with me so far and even gave me a raise recently. 
 If anyone could give me their 2 cents and some insight into what I should expect as a junior system admin going from end-user support. that would be cool.

 I&#x27;m trying to consolidate consoles a little, at least bring as much as I can into one place. Ideal would be an agentless network monitor which could drill down and crucially allow a jump off into RDP or similar onto an endpoint... whilst processing logging, potentially a light SIEM capability, amd asset management. And a laser beam to scratch my bum from space.
 Closest I&#x27;ve found is Auvik, possibly ManageEngine. Solarwinds ticks most boxes as a solution.. but...well. Not sure I&#x27;m ready to forgive on that one...
 Any suggestions and experiences gratefully received.

                              <span>I currently work in IT and there have been many non-IT platforms migrated from on-prem to the cloud.
 When these programs were on-prem, they had very simple passwords as access was only permitted via VPN or no-prem network. When they were moved to cloud, there was no care or concern to change them.
 I have reported these security issues to our IT management and no action was taken.
 FYI, username was simple like admin or administrator and the password was shown on the same page or the default that the vendor has for their clients. Also, these platforms give full admin access and full view of all information, statistics, user privileges, clients etc.
 These cloud platforms run the core functions of our organization and are used by every department (no 2fa, with no password policies, no restrictions and are globally available via subdomain).
 Additionally, our InfoSec team has been aware and have let management know, but no action either. Also when these platforms were migrated, InfoSec was not involved in any step too.
 What do I do (or not do)?

                              <span>We are looking at Absolute (https://www.absolute.com/) as a asset management solution. In our onboarding meeting yesterday with their team, we were unable to deploy the agent via Intune, because the msi file requires access to two additional files during the install. They do not seem to have an agent that is deployable via Intune.
 Has anyone successfully deployed the agent via Intune?

                              <span>Rackspace is having a major outage, and it looks like ransomware. ETA on a fix is unknown, and I need to start working on a solution asap. 
 We have a few thousand mailboxes on Rackspace Email and less than one hundred on Hosted Exchange on the same domain. Rackspace’s temp fix requires us to migrate everyone to M365, but I’m wondering if I could(should?) spin up a new domain for the impacted Exchange mailboxes only.
 They’d be fresh mailboxes, but it might buy us the time needed to recover from the attack. Migrating a few thousand healthy mailboxes seems like a bad idea just to save less than one hundred.
 I’m not taking any action until I’m able to speak with them. Left a callback request with support, but no response yet.

 But it is disabled by default. Am I misunderstanding what the setting does?
 Thanks!

 Lesson learned: The alternative email is a thing... just in case you revolve on a password reset for admin creds during a mass outage.

 Is this the correct way to go about implementing the client side aka the oneshot hello.service or am I doing something wrong? And is there a better way?
 The reason why I chose this is because it allows me to then call the script simply by hello command.
 For the server:
 [Unit] AssertPathExists&#x3D;/usr/bin/hellod [Service] ExecStart&#x3D;/usr/bin/hellod Restart&#x3D;always PrivateTmp&#x3D;false NoNewPrivileges&#x3D;false [Install] WantedBy&#x3D;default.target 
 And for the client:
 [Unit] Requires&#x3D;hellod.service After&#x3D;hellod.service AssertPathExists&#x3D;/usr/bin/hello [Service] Type&#x3D;oneshot ExecStart&#x3D;/usr/bin/hello --init RemainAfterExit&#x3D;true PrivateTmp&#x3D;false NoNewPrivileges&#x3D;false [Install] Alias&#x3D;hello WantedBy&#x3D;default.target 
 Also is /usr/bin/ the correct location to store the hello and hellod scripts?
 And whats the correct location to store user configurable files, maybe /etc/hello?

                              <span>Can I get some advice and opinions please.
 I began a quick format on a 60TB SAN storage partition connected over iSCSI around 6 hours ago on Server 2019.
 The aim is to start fresh for backup storage due to capacity issues.
 Disk Manager just says &quot;formatting&quot; with no percentage or any other indication of what is happening here.
 Was this approach the wrong way to do this?
 Should the operation to prepare the drive have been done via the SAN management application?
 Wondering if this will ever finish.....Should I cancel the format operation and just delete the existing data in there?
 Is cancelling at this point risky? The data is not important but I need the storage to be reliable and ready to be reused 
 Is there any way of telling if progress is being made? The only indicator I can think of for now is to go to Resource Manager and I can see the drive activity is maxed and running so at least I know its not hung. 
 Any estimates on how long it may take to complete?
 *** EDIT ***
 OK answer here became obvious..... Rebooted Server. Deleting, recreating partition with a quick format then worked within 5 mins. 
 Lesson I&#x27;m taking out of this is to preemptively reboot before starting anything that could suck up time and cause worry and frustration.
 Thanks again for the help all.

                              <span>I recently came into possession of a UPS that was decommissioned from an old server rack at my friend&#x27;s office. They were throwing it out so I gladly took it off their hands. Unfortunately, I didn&#x27;t know it was a 240v UPS. My homelab is entirely running on 120v and I don&#x27;t have any 240v outlets in the server room.
 The server rack is currently on a circuit which has very low load (aside from the rack itself). I see 3 options here, which are below:
  
Purchase a step-up transformer to plug into the 120v outlet, to give the UPS 240v output
 Use two different out-of-phase outlets on different circuits and wire them to a single 240v plug
 Pay an electrician to run a new circuit dedicated for the UPS
  
Obviously Option 3 is the most ideal option, but running a new circuit will be somewhat difficult and expensive due to the layout of my house. Option 2 sounds sketchy as hell, but should theoretically work (I have two different circuits in the server room). Option 1 sounds easy, but I am worried about dirty power or low amperage.
 What do you guys think?

                              <span>Does anyone have experience running/building a primarily tape based data archiving system for long term(10-50 years) storage?
 I&#x27;ve been recently handed such a project and have been reading up on it and trying to find suitable solutions or software components to implement it. If anyone has any experience in the subject I&#x27;d like to hear it.
 I know of irods, which is a data management system but doesn&#x27;t handle the storage itself.
 Tape based is a requirement, so is an open format(ltfs, otf etc) for long term compatibility. Some form of cataloging is also required. And automated ingestion is a plus.
 So far I&#x27;ve come up with irods+cea phobos. Or spectrum archive library edition + mergerfs and irods.
 Edit: I also know of fujifilm object archive. But it&#x27;s a paid solution.
 Edit 2: cloud is not an option, should&#x27;ve probably included that from the beginning.

After discussing pay ranges the recruiter said a Level 3 wouldn’t even pay what I was making at the time, but there was a level 4 position they hadn’t posted yet. I agreed to interview, which was supposed to be the hiring manager and a technical lead.
 Instead they ended up having 2 level 3 admins interview me. They were mostly concerned with who I knew at Rackspace and when I didn’t know anyone they wondered how I got an interview. They began asking me questions about my resume as I have a lot of varied experience.

 Here are the steps I recommend for other small companies that are cost-conscious:
 1) Through Rackspace&#x27;s Office 365 page, buy Rackspace-managed Office 365 licenses for all the users. These show up in 365 Admin as &quot;Reseller&quot; licenses, as opposed to licenses purchased directly from Microsoft which show up as &quot;Commercial direct&quot;.
 2) Use Rackspace&#x27;s email migration tool (which is actually BitTitan MigrationWiz reskinned for Rackspace) to migrate all of the Rackspace/Hosted Exchange addresses to 365. This tool comes bund…</span>

                              <span>I have been looking into the process of renaming an Active Directory Domain, out of curiosity rather than the need to actually do this in production.
 The process itself, using the rendom utility seems straightforward and is well documented online.
 There are, of course, caveats and unsupported scenarios i.e Exchange on premise.
 It is obviously a major change to the core structure of a network as you are changing AD name, Dns, renaming Dcs, Group Policy, and Pcs.
 My question is ... have you ever done this in a production environment and, most importantly, how did it go?
 Was it smooth sailing?
 Were there unexpected consequences or issues post rename?

                              <span>Sorry for venting but this pisses me off. Also English is not my first language, so bear with me.
 ​
 To set up the scenario: I am 40+, working 20+ years in IT and do something IT management and network engineering related nowadays. Started off somewhere around the Y2k problem with floppy disks in my hand ;)
 ​
 Yesterday a somewhat recently retired neighbour of mine approached me via WhatsApp if I could come upstairs in the evening to help with &quot;an IT problem related to hard disks&quot;. This was the first time in the last 12 years we live here.
 ​
 I texted back that I am sorry but I do not do any IT support outside my family, because the small issues could easily escalate in terms of time and knowledge invested and that this was abused in the past. Got no answer.
 ​
 Today I met him outside the house and was getting blasted with how angry he is and how I lack a sense of community and how &quot;all IT people&quot; tell him the same (ah?) and that we all need help (what?). And that his question would be something about his TV and that is HDD is now empty/blank.
 ​
 To top it off, he yelled at me in front of my kids while we were on our way to get a Christmas tree.
 ​
 Really?
 ​
 Am I supposed to get &#x27;ready for work&#x27; on a Friday evening after an exhausting week to peek into something which is both outside my expertise (datacentre !&#x3D; TV) nor interest?
 ​
 Why is it that non-IT people seem to take it as totally granted that you fix any consumer product because &quot;you work in IT&quot;.
 ​
 I am totally sick of it. Am I the asshole or do I have one as neighbour?
 ​
 Any advise, pat on the back or other form of moral support is appreciated :]

                              <span>I hope this is the best sub to post in. I have a 20-year career in Infrastructure. Lots of Linux/Unix. Lots of networks. General infra like VMware, storage, sysadmin etc. I have moved to use the cloud in the last 7 years as well. I have (finally) been promoted and now find myself Head of Infrastructure. It&#x27;s a lofty title for what I actually do but it&#x27;s good. I have two teams I supervise, an infra team of more classic sysadmins, and a DevOps team which is developers who are interested and work in infra stuff. My role is extremely hands-on around 50% still doing infrastructure engineering but I am gaining more staff so that will continue to reduce with time.
 I am planning for the future and looking at similar roles to see what I need to be aiming for. What I am interested in right now is what sort of interview questions should I expect for these sorts of roles. Since I didn&#x27;t interview for my Head of role I&#x27;ve never had a management interview. 
 What are the general questions I should expect, is there any changes to my interview style over engineering roles I need to anticipate? (I found being extremely relaxed and personable worked very well, but I understand cultural differences here come into play as London and Stockholm, where I have worked, are very relaxed environments for engineering roles where that might not be the case where you are from). Any other general advice anybody might have?

All employees are working at our office and have an in-house storage server sharing files/projects to the editor&#x27;s PC using LAN. so, we gave access to the editor of a file according to assign their project. After covid pandemic, we want to shift our all IT infrastructure remotely. For same, we are planning to use AWS ec2 for computation power, and for storage, we want to utilize only our on-premise storage server. Any service/product that can help to achieve this type of solution?

 Note: 
  
we can&#x27;t use storage in the cloud for projects ( Because one project storage size is 20-30 TB If we give storage to individual VM then it will cost us) to allocate that project we want to utilize an in-house storage server in a Virtual Machine.

 Which of these columns should I be monitoring for indicating a memory leak or does this cmd miss the mark? Or is there a different attribute I should be looking for since expanded properties is quite lengthy? I just grabbed the ones related to what I thought were memory related.

 I have been tasked with figuring out how to join an Ubuntu 22.04 desktop as a domain computer and write a wiki on how to do it for both new and existing computers.
 I setup a new Ubuntu computer and went through the default steps to join the domain. It accepted everything and I logged out and tried logging back in using my domain credentials and it didn’t reject it but it just kept saying that it’s logging in.
 Now that I’m home I remembered that I didn’t adjust the settings to allow it to automatically create a new home directory for new logins so I’m guessing it te…</span>

 I realize that this feature is still in “preview”, but it is so annoying enrolling the users with a csv. Why do you have to set the UPN in the csv? Why does Microsoft not let you assign them once the seeds are already in azure? We don’t really care for the idea of keeping a seed file around while we wait for new users to onboard so we can assign them. 
 Then having to activate the token after the fact takes forever when you have large groups onboarding. 
 I would love to only use authenticator, unfortunately we cannot force them to use their personal device for it. 
 Does anyone have insight into this or workarounds?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello Friends,
 I work for an IT company and have 15 years of experience in Telecom domain. I worked on various Network Inventory design and Audit projects which were not much technical in nature. The network inventory design involved the various vendors SDH/SONET transport devices, Cisco and Nokia switches and routers.
 I don&#x27;t have any hands on experience configuring the routers and switches in the live network.
 In my current project, I am responsible to setup E2E test environment (Integration of applications) and physically connect the various DOCSIS cable modems and gateways and fiber ONTs devices in the test lab and auto provision them in ICOMS and backend systems.
 I am doing good in this project and my efforts are highly appreciated by the client managers.
 But then I really don&#x27;t know what to do next to progress in my career. 
 Recently, I cleared AWS solution architect associate exam.
 I am planning to upskill myself in following areas and would need some geniune advice on what should I do next.
 I have a weakness of not being consistent with my studies or certifications. Back of the mind, I think what is the use of doing certifications if there is no real practical experience and companies prefer to appoint those who have solid hands on experience.
 Please suggest

Thank you

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been going through some online tutorials about Cisco ACI but some of the concepts are so confusing I couldnt get my head around. I am from Nexus N9k standalone background, could someone explain these terms in an easy way:
 - Bridge domain (What is the difference between VLAN, SVI and bridge domain)
 - EPG : Is there any equivalent term or concept in a standalone cisco switch?
 - L3Out and Interface Profile: L3Out I understand is when you want a leaf in the fabric to establish L3 adjacency to external router, this seems bit easy to grasp but what exactly is Interface Profile again?

 My EdgeSwitch at work is telling me that there are two devices plugged into Port 1 and Port 2, and that they are using PoE and they are sending/receiving data, but the Mac table doesn&#x27;t seem to know what the IP addresses are. 
 Can anyone explain to me what I might be seeing here? I feel like I&#x27;m in patch panel hell right now trying to figure out where all these unlabeled cables go.

                              <span>Hi, im curious how you segment and design your ICS network?
 What makes up of your security zones? Do all traffic pass through your firewall? Do you do l3 segmentation with vrfs and sandwich the firewall?
 We currently have a ROAS design with subinterfaces to 2x l3 switches, which in turn have dot1q trunk links to the access switches.
 Since we&#x27;re increasing in hosts I was wondering if maybe we should decrease the traffic going through the fw by instead do intervlan routing and route only specific vrfs to firewall. I heard this is a popular design.
 Would be nice to see some examples of how a design would be.

                              <span>Hey everyone!
 Here is our dilemma - 
 We have Cisco FPR 2140s (4 of them, 2 HA pairs, 1 pair at each data center). We are currently trying to setup ECMP but we found out that SSL cannot be enabled on interfaces that you want to participate in EMCP. Fine, we are in the process of converting them to IPsec but the implementation of IPsec RA VPN to a Cisco firepower sucks honestly. It seems it was an after thought as there has to be a local XML on every endpoint in order for the first connection to be made (after the first connection, the endpoint pulls the XML from the firewall)
 We don&#x27;t think we can do this because of the mobile IoT devices that our company VPNs with. We also have some site to sites that are causing us to make VTIs and our company just keeps growing it seems and the firewalls are getting more complex with that. (sorry for the rant)
 QUESTION - We are looking into getting 2 separate firewalls (1 at each data center) to handle RA VPN, site to sites and any other odds and ends. We have public IP addressing to accomplish this but I am wondering if anyone else does something similar? Breaks portions of config onto different devices just to make it more simple rather than trying to do everyone on one firewall

                              <span>I have set up 2 VLANS, both working fine. The fist VLAN is for my 15 cameras and the second one is for my 5 wired computers. The problem is that when I&#x27;m on any of the 5 computers I cannot connect to the managed switch gui to manage it. I am assuming I need to do something that &quot;allows&quot; a computer in a VLAN to get to the managed switch GUI but I haven&#x27;t had any luck. My managed switch background is weak but I&#x27;m assuming such a setting/config change would be similar across mfg&#x27;s switches. Anyone have any idea? PS, I have to move the cable to a port outside of the VLAN in order to manage the switch.

                              <span>I look at the SD-WAN solutions out there, and I just feel like I&#x27;d be better off with a traditional routing design in most cases, especially given the siloed nature of most organizations (eg..separate networking, server, security groups etc...). That means separate appliances for separate groups that provide a clean separation of responsibility. 
 The market has been flooded with SD-WAN products and the marketing is starting to become all a blur. 
 Just wondering who here has bought into a vendor&#x27;s SD-WAN story and how are they liking it?

                              <span>My lecturer said that it&#x27;s layer 5 as it&#x27;s associated with authentication but every network professional I asked at work said it&#x27;s layer 7 as 2FA interacts with applications and the end user.
 Initially I thought it was layer 7 from my understanding but upon researching more, I&#x27;m stuck between the two as 2FA is authenticating (L5) but is also interacting with end users and applications (L7). Is it possible that 2FA works at both layers?
 Btw in my scenario 2FA will be protecting access to a network&#x27;s server as well as applications. Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking to get some experience managing cumulus based switches and I&#x27;m in need of a new ToR switch since my aruba died, I was wondering if anyone else here had experience with managing them and if so, how are they?
 ​
 One other concern I have is noise level. Is anyone aware of just how loud supermicro&#x27;s switches are?

                              <span>Just wondering what everyone&#x27;s thoughts are on Application Guard. It sounds super slick. I set it up on my testing computer and it works. 
 But is it just me, or is it unnecessarily cumbersome for both the user and the administrator? I kind of get the administrator part, that&#x27;s to be expected. But launching a completely different window seems like it&#x27;s really going to get on users&#x27; nerves and be a hard sell to decision makers. Especially when the decision makers/contributors themselves are the ones that have to be on external sites regularly.
 It would be nice if the Application Guard instance opened in a new tab rather than a whole new window similar to the IE mode.
 How do others manage Application Guard?

But when I login with the user account added to the user-mapping.xml it can see the RDP connections. Is there something I&#x27;m missing from the user-mapping.xml so that when my ldap users login they have those RDP connections? I&#x27;ve gone through the Guacamole documention but I can&#x27;t seem to find what I&#x27;m missing. Or I just don&#x27;t understand. Thanks for any help.

I am very happy about this but still have a long way to go before I feel comfortable with this new position. I have never officially managed a team and I am mind blown that I was offered the position today. With that being said I want to be the best that I can my team consist of one other person with contractors helping us when needed to complete task. We will be looking for a backfill for my position soon. Is there any advice you all have for an IT Support Engineer that is stepping into management for the first time?

                              <span>I am sys admin and part of my jobs are processing file. half an time file has all kind of error, and my legacy system has hard time to pre-parse and figure out the error. so I want to have a pre-processor to validate the file against the spec. common error is like this
  
spec has 200 fields, csv contains 195
 field should be A or B or C, but cvs contains 1.2
 field is required, but csv has blank value
 field is limit to 255 characters, csv send 300
  
should this be a python, shell script, cmd line (I am using windows)? is notepad++ has a plugin for that?
 Thank you!

 I have no experience at all with xpath until playing around with PowerAutomate to do this, so I have a feeling my issue is with my queries being as bare basic as possible, with my secondary thoughts being that my flow is not configured to do more than a single loop and only taking the first value.
 Could someone point me in the right direction outside of reading through https://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp?

 Does anyone have a good guide for applying CU&#x27;s to Exchange 2016 servers? Last time we applied one it was a nightmare. We don&#x27;t have a DAG or anything fancy. We just ran into so many errors during the install, mostly related to AD. 
 Thanks!

 Where would you place a PDU and a server in a rack and why would you choose that arrangement? 
 I was thinking for PDU its better to have it close to the bottom for short cabling but I’m not sure with servers.

                              <span>Just trying to get some issues resolved that I been dealing with this week, and just trying to talk to someone with various vendor support has been agravating. I got 2 issues with some software with one company and I put the ticket in on Tuesday and never got a call back 9the person you initially talk to won&#x27;t even try to help and just takes name and number), I called yesterday and had to call 3 times to talk to the person on my case. they gave me something to try, but it didn&#x27;t work. I called 4 times today, and kept getting told the person on my case was either on a call or on lunch and I would get a call right back. Here we are 20 min before I am about to leave and I just called again after being told at 2:20 that the agent was on lunch and to try back in 30 min. So just called and was told they are on lunch and try back in 30 min...so they taking a 2 hour lunch?

 Just frustrating

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have been beating my head on the wall trying to fix this weird issue: when I move computers to a different OU (with different Policy), the computers would still obeying the old policy that was applied to them in the former group.
 For example, I was having a container where computers are locked out after 30 minutes of inactivity and another container where computers are locked out after 8 hours.
 I moved a few computers from the 30 mins group to the 8 hours group.
 I ran gpresult /r on said computers and the results showing the new policy was successfully applied (8 hours). Local group policy showing that they are supposed to be logged out by 8 hours. But lo and behold, the naughty computers still locked themselves out after 30 minutes.
 So far I have tried many fixes, including 
 - Clear group policy catches
 - Took them off the domain, force policy update there, and put them back on.
 - anything else I could think of.
 ​
 Have you ever run into this issue? Please enlighten me! (I am a new system admin and inherited this weird ass system that needs a lot of reorganizing).
 ​
 Thank you so much!

 We’ve all been there before - the wording from a third party when something is fubar. The lack of updates, and in this case phrasing straight out of the offshore 1st line support playbook. This issue is at 12 hours odd now, to still be in the investigation stage says they know what’s wrong, it’s big, they don’t have a fix, or, they have no clue, which 12 hours in is a worry. 
 At this point, if you have users in rack space hosted email, I’d be looking at standing up a new solution to give functionality from now, and worry about historic data later - I fear this may not be a quick fix, or even something with a full fix. 
 I can’t think of anything that would create a 12 hour outage of exchange/hosted exchange that’s still in investigation (figuring out wtf is wrong) beyond something that is known, and the investigation is how the fuck do we unfuck this!
 Be prepared for the worst, hope for the best!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking at various UEMs to help us manage our Windows workforce, much of which is remote (working from home), off the corporate network. Today we use PDQ Deploy + Inventory and love it, but it&#x27;s limited to on-net management. PDQ Connect is coming and looks like it&#x27;s going in a good direction, but I&#x27;ve got almost 1,000 PC&#x27;s to a manage now, so I&#x27;m open to alternatives - and the solution that keeps coming up is Microsoft Intune. 
 We would like an application deployment solution that is flexible but will also let us run Powershell scripts, create groups and reports, and ideally provide a way to access the remote computer over the internet. Bonus if it works for Mac as well as Windows (though we are 99% Windows). One of the things I&#x27;ve seen with Intune that I really like is the ability to create PC profiles and once a user logs in to Azure AD, Intune (or Autopilot?) automatically deploys a profile to the computer. That seems powerful. 
 Other thoughts on Intune as a potential alternative (or accompaniment?) to PDQ?

                              <span>Hey all. I&#x27;m trying to get management to approve a display to show IT data like virus attacks, network speed, and all kinds of IT info. Does anyone have anything like this that wouldn&#x27;t mind sharing a pic of what the display would look like so I can show management, just to get the approval for the display? We have a TV that we are swapping out and I thought it would be nice to have it for showing off data to people that are interested.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been asked to create an IT solution for a management issue. They want me to block YouTube on a single machine. My first thought is to do this at the network&#x27;s firewall but ran into two issues. Our firewall is managed by our ISP, so it could take a while to implement, and I&#x27;m not quite sure how to target the single machine that&#x27;s on DHCP, by MAC address maybe?
 Anyways.
 My current solution is to modify the hosts file and dump each web browsers cache. I have a PowerShell script for the hosts entries because YouTube has quite a few, and then I manually dump the browser caches. Any ideas how the user could get around this (beyond the obvious, user can edit the hosts file themselves because everybody here still has local admin, against my recommendations), or is there a better way?
 $baseEntry &#x3D; &quot;&#x60;n127.0.0.1&#x60;t&quot; $ytDomains &#x3D; @() # string array of domains I found here: https://www.netify.ai/resources/applications/youtube # cant list them, as previous post was removed because some are url shorteners foreach ($site in $ytDomains){ Add-Content -Path $env:windir\System32\drivers\etc\hosts -Value &quot;$($baseEntry)$($site) www.$($site)&quot; -Force } ipconfig /flushdns nbtstat -R

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know if this is the correct sub for this, but maybe.
 my business has become the target of someone who is repeatedly autodialing our primary reception phone number. we block the number that&#x27;s coming up as call ID, but then the attacker changes the number and starts again. Our phone provider (a voip pbx provider using voip.ms as their trunk) says they are not able to identify the original number but have confirmed the numbers are spoofed. The attacker calls periodically and berates the receptionist looking for some information that we don&#x27;t have, and has told her they will jam up our switchboards until we give them the information. This has been going on for about 3 weeks. The caller has said they are in south africa, though the numbers they call from are 10 digit north american numbers. My receptionist took it on herself to give the attacker some fake information that she thought might satiate them, but it was quickly identified as false and seemed to enrage them further.
 I discussed this with the RCMP (canadian police force) and they were able to call to one of the numbers that the attacker had called from and speak to them and told them to stop. However that was about as effective as you&#x27;d expect. The RCMP said there was nothing additional that they could do and to contact the anti-fraud division (which I&#x27;m going to be doing today with limited expectations for success)
 So, given that I am not able to block the calls as the call ID keep changing and my phone provider isn&#x27;t able to identify the actual source of the calls in order to provide to law enforcement, what options remain?

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been with a company that I&#x27;ve been very committed to for a number of years. The pay was ok, the commute was short, and it&#x27;s a top tier position for the rural area I live in.
 And for the last two years I&#x27;ve been actively recruited for a Senior Network/Systems Engineer position with a tech firm who has high margins and a small number of employees. I&#x27;ll be next in line to the CTO- with a clear path to his position.
 The nature of this company is that they do not really have much other than technical employees- and I&#x27;m running the show.
 It&#x27;s also a very good paying gig.
 And while this is the best move for me there&#x27;s an emotional component I&#x27;ve not not really felt before.
 There&#x27;s no red flags or misgivings... but a lot of sadness. I more or less rescued the company from technical oblivion and built out fault tolerant systems which have really paid off.
 I&#x27;m going to miss my day today at this company. The people I can still have a relationships with.
 It was hard to see real sadness in the CEOs eyes when I gave him notice.
 Then there&#x27;s the excitement of the new position. Lots of perks. Underground parking. Working with a strong competent team. 
 And yet- even though I am leaving my current position for all the right reasons.. I still feel sad.
 It&#x27;s a big change.... and off we go.

                              <span>Good Morning:
 I am a SysAdmin* for a services company that has a workforce that changes frequently as it is contract based. We can go from 150 workers to 600+ in a matter of hours. As such, we are primarily in the &quot;cloud&quot; using virtualization services.
 Nonetheless, we still have a a physical HQ and a handful of full-time employees that require hardware. We are about to dump our MS and will be facing a situation wherein we will not have a means of safely/reliably obtaining the limited amount of hardware we occasionally need. We have tried Amazon with mixed to terrible results (and, honestly, we would be loathe to reveal this during an ISO audit) and companies like CDW are too rich for our blood, and companies like DELL and HP are not all that interested in entering into a lease program as we are very small potatoes. 
 So, do any of y&#x27;all have suggestions? It is important the source is reliable and on the up and up as we are ISO compliant and would like to keep it that way.
 Thank you!

                              <span>We have a secure site (HTTPS) self-hosted. GoDaddy handles the DNS. 
 What we want to happen is if a user enters http://{domain}.com/, https://{domain}.com/ or http://www.{domain}.com/ we want it to redirect the user to https://www.{domain}.com/.
 Currently if a user enters http://{domain}.com/ it redirects to https://{domain}.com/ and if a user enters http://{domain}.com/ it redirects to https://www.{domain}.com/
 How can we get all 3 of the other domains to redirect to the https://www version of the site?

                              <span>I read an article once that memory is handled differently in Windows 10 between a machine shutdown and a machine restart. A Windows 10 machine shutdown will cache memory. A restart starts from scratch. No power flows. No memory.
 Regarding VMs. Is the behavior the same? Does memory truly reset?
 I have a data archive on a proprietary time series database that is telling me it needs help. I cycled the server yesterday morning and it is still complaining. My gut tells me there is a flag on the file somewhere that I need to reset. I&#x27;m looking for it. Can&#x27;t find a KB on it though.
 As always thank you for your time. This is really a helpful community. My IT department isn&#x27;t always as motivated as I need them to be. I get more replies to my questions on this sub than I get replies to my emails.

                              <span>So i&#x27;m at a loss as to what to do about a fingerprint issue we&#x27;re experiencing. We&#x27;ve previously enabled Windows Hello for Business and everything has been working great for probably a year now. 
 Now, all of a sudden the fingerprint readers are being super weird. They will work right after a reboot just fine, but after some time goes by when you next go to login it just doesn&#x27;t act like you&#x27;ve touched the fingerprint reader at all. However, after unlocking with the password and then immediately locking the pc again it works perfectly! But if some time goes by... same non responsive issue. It does not give any failure messages.. just acts like it hasn&#x27;t been touched.
 I have disabled usb selective suspend, disabled the pc from turning the device off to save power within device manager. Uninstalled antivirus, fully went through windows updates, updated all gpo policies with the newest templates and double checked them to make sure nothing changed. I&#x27;ve also made sure domain controllers were up to date on updates.
 Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this? It seems to be domain wide as it&#x27;s not just one pc and it&#x27;s the exact same symptoms on everyone of them.

                              <span>Periodically, DNS entries for some of our servers that have static IP addresses disappear. We do have scavenging enabled for the default of 7 days for the No-Refresh Interval and the Refresh Interval. I&#x27;m assuming this is what&#x27;s removing them. My understanding from Microsoft is that &quot;Windows computers that are statically configured for TCP/IP try to dynamically register host address (A) and pointer (PTR) resource records.&quot; And, &quot;Windows registers A and PTR resource records every 24 hours regardless of the computer&#x27;s role.&quot; So if these servers are supposed to register every 24 hours, I don&#x27; understand why they&#x27;re being scavenged. Are there specific logs that can help me troubleshooting this? I&#x27;ve looked through event viewer but didn&#x27;t find anything helpful.

                              <span>So for a long time people were grousing that there&#x27;s some slowness on the network, but we really could not pinpoint the exact cause of it.
 Last week the financial department complained that their financial program keeps on bombing out. So I decided to step in this week and try to find the cause of this issue for once and for all.
 Everything networking at their workstations was replaced. Flyleads was tested prior to being installed, and yet the problem persisted.
 A couple of tests later, and everything pointed to either a network cable fault issue or something on the core switch.
 Today we got in the &quot;expert&quot;. He followed my test steps, and agreed that there is something funky going on, it either is the cabling or the core switch.
 So off to the server room we toddled, and do a few more tests on the switch. Same results.
 So we decided to reboot the switch by pulling power and bring it back on. He wanted to warn the people, but I know that people will just be dragging out the reboot because they have &quot;important&quot; things to do. Like finish watching that youtube clip with the hot chick, or do some work on their important resume. So... power was pulled. Future me won&#x27;t be pleased with myself should it come back to bite my a$$.
 Switch rebooted - and the one blade did not come back up. Found the fault, yay.
 But it also cut out the internet because our CPE was connected to that specific blade. Took a little juggling around of cables, but we got everything up again.
 Now we will have to wait for a replacement blade, but in the meantime things should be OK for now.
 And the good news is, that slowness is now gone.
 I t was bound to pop sooner or later anyway, better that it popped whilst the expert was there.

                              <span>I know it&#x27;s a longshot, but do any of you use Solarwinds to monitor APC/Cyberpower devices? Our parent company just added these to the Solarwinds instance, but do not actually monitor anything &quot;power related&quot; (outlet usage, voltage in/out, etc). All they show is historical availability, ping/packet loss, and basic device info.
 I was wondering...
  
What options exist for monitoring these types of devices? (electricity, ping, connected devices, etc)
 What do you specifically look at?
 Anything else I should be aware of?

I&#x27;ve tried speaking to Webroot support but so far we haven&#x27;t really gotten anywhere, has anyone else had any luck with resolving this? This has happened on both servers and workstations and is becoming a much more annoying problem every day.

                              <span>Hi all
 We&#x27;re evaluating a software program and one of the recommended specs is related to resolution. 1680x1050 resolution with 32-bit color support. 
 I understand that the specs on the monitors need to show 16.7 million colors. Where I&#x27;m confused is what spec do I need to look at for the graphics card in a laptop or desktop pc. For example, when looking at a laptop that comes with 
 Intel UHD Graphics 630
 and 
 i5-10500T processor,
 nowhere on the intel specs page do I see anything related to 16.7 million colors or 32-bit color.
 Intel Core i510500T Processor 12M Cache up to 3.80 GHz Product Specifications 
 If anyone can point me in the right direction, I&#x27;d really appreciate it. 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I am looking for a way to share a docking station (with USB C output) between two computers, like a switch or something similar. 
 https://ibb.co/vL1g3Ys
 This is a diagram to illustrate my thought.
 I have heard of KVM but it looks a bit expensive.
 Is there such a switch that share a docking station between two computers?

During the day they send perfectly fine but for some reason in the later afternoon service drops off, sends emails to the delay send box. Not really sure what or why this would occur during a specific time of the day but seems to also be effecting only executive staff but also have not had the time to ask other individuals in the company on our network.

 Thanks again for any help on this guys! love this sub.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am having an issue with one of our customers (work in an MSP).
 On their host server (win svr 16 std) they have a data drive where they only have some VM VHDX files stored. Windirstat reports that approx. 850 GB is being used.
 But Windows reports that there is 204GB free of2.17TB.
 We are unable to find what is causing this disparity.
 We initially thought the issue was due to shadow copies from their anti-virus, but we&#x27;ve deleted all the shadow copies and it only cleared a small amount of space. Shadow copies are now set to only use 10% of each drive. There was an issue with the previous version of the AV client that would fill the drive with shadow copies, however this was resolved in the latest patch.
 We believe that there is still space allocated to, or hidden shadow copies, however windows reports that only approx. 90gb is used for shadow copies.
 We&#x27;re stumped on this one, any ideas? Has anyone seen this before.
 Happy to provide more info where I can.

 The attempt to search the administrator audit log failed. Please try again later.

I am a member of the proper groups, compliance, records, and organization management. I&#x27;ve tried rebuilding the index database but it keeps failing. I even tried enabling TLS1.0 like a different online post said but it didn&#x27;t work as well.

 Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.

                              <span>I thought you folks might be interested in an email scam I received yesterday; an email that said I had an outstanding invoice that needed to be paid from PayPal.
 Now I obviously this tripped my scam senses, but it had made it to my inbox through google&#x27;s spam stuff and I couldn&#x27;t immediately work out how it was a scam, the email appeared genuine, it did actually come from PayPal, it had passed SPF, DKIM etc, all links went to genuine PayPal URLs.
 It was then I realised what the scammers had done.
 PayPal lets you use them for invoicing, if you have a PayPal business account (or more likely if scammers have access to a compromised PayPal business account) you can go &quot;Create me an invoice, send it to this email address, with this information in it&quot;
 They raised a real invoice for $500 and in the information where you&#x27;re supposed to put details about the invoice they had just put &quot;This money will be invoiced immediately, If you wish to contact us about this charge, please phone xxx xxxx xxx&quot;, at which point you end up with a scam call centre who will work you through some sort of banking refund scam like you see on Kitboga, Jim Browning and Mark Rober et al.
 But for all intents and purposes, this looks like a real email that has genuinely come from PayPal, because it really has genuinely come from PayPal.
 One to watch out for.

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;ve been tasked to take over from an older gentleman who has left the environment in a huge mess.
 Basically we have a local office which has 3 subnets (country A - HQ):
 - Corp LAN- Corp WIFI- Server
 Country B:- Corp LAN- Corp WIFI
 Country C:- Corp LAN- Corp WIFI
 Countries A through C all have their DHCPs via Windows Server.
 To pass compliance, he - manually enters EACH machine&#x27;s MAC address for WIFI and LAN (DHCP reservation) - so giving the illusion that - you can&#x27;t plug your personal machine onto corporate network - when we all know - MAC address cloning is a way to bypass.
 The problem comes when people travel between countries and can&#x27;t connect to network, so he adds their MAC to that country&#x27;s DHCP server
 So the question to my fellow sysadmins, what solutions / products are there on the market to make this less painful to manage?

                              <span>Really quick one. Looking to potentially setup NPS with the Azure MFA Extension but hearing rumours it&#x27;s going to be going End Of Life in the near future. Can anyone confirm? Documentation and support on the NPS with MFA seems to be patchy at best so if it&#x27;s going to be potentially pulled may look into alternative solutions.

                              <span>KYIV, Ukraine — With Ukraine scrambling to keep communication lines open during the war, an army of engineers from the country’s phone companies has mobilized to help the public and policymakers stay in touch during repeated Russian missile and drone strikes.
 The engineers, who typically go unseen and unsung in peacetime, often work around the clock to maintain or restore phone service, sometimes braving minefields to do so. After Russian strikes took out the electricity that cellphone towers usually run on, they revved up generators to keep the towers on.
 “I know our guys — my colleagues — are very exhausted, but they’re motivated by the fact that we are doing an important thing,” Yuriy Dugnist, an engineer with Ukrainian telecommunications company Kyivstar, said after crunching through…</span>

                              <span>Hi there,
 Is there anyone in possession of an active McAfee Endpoint Product Removal tool?
 I have loocked everywhere for it and the only version i found wa expired in 2020. There is another option to get this tool but you need a Grant number to get access to it and i dont know where the Grant number is located or if i have it as these laptops of witch im trying to remove them from is from a company that doesnt have any knowledge of the installation or agreement qith McAfee.
 I have tried with the support team but they dont seem to be helpful.
 Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>HI all
 Sorry if this is not the place to post this
 I have been asked to look into getting a new server for the CCTV we have. We use Avigilon with HIKvison cameras, the server will need to work for 75 cameras and keep 14 days of footage.
 We don&#x27;t have the funds to get one from Avigilon they&#x27;re not cheep 
 The current server is showing its age, it&#x27;s a Xeon E3-1220v5 with 8GB and 16TB of storage (H730 card) from Avigilon look like so kind of dell server i think.
 i have no idea what makes a good CCTV server so any help will be grate 
 thanks M

 It should be doable to add some lines to ignore all of the security stuff?
 I know it&#x27;s far from best practise but I just need it to work for few more months.

                              <span>Hello,
 my company acquired a customer who is using Lotus Domino 9 with no absolute intention to switch to other products (Exchange Online, etc...).
 We use Veeam Backup &amp; Replication to make backups and replicas of the entire virtualized infrastructure (hypervisor is VMware).
 I spoke with the company who manages Lotus Domino and they told me that almost all backup products are not compatibile with LD databases i.e. even Veeam can fail to backup it through VSS causing inconsistencies when restoring data. According to this company, the only ways to make it work are: 
  
update to LD v12 that has some internal features to manage backups.
 use Veeam with batch scripts to stop LD services at the beginnning of the job and to make them start at the end
  
This customer have an ancient backup software, Symantec Backup Exec 2012, that used to backup the LD database but right now is not working. I know nothing about LD and I know this is a hell of a situation.
 Still, I wanted to know what do you do in these cases, do you know a software that works with LD DBs? What is it your experience with LD DBs?

                              <span>02:15 &quot;Hey Dal90, Teams is down!&quot;
 02:30 &quot;Um, it&#x27;s down at Microsoft per https://portal.office.com/servicestatus&quot;
 Kind of curious why they call it Teams (Consumer) but I presume it includes our Teams since it is down and we&#x27;re down.
 Oh what is this email from our Network &amp; Firewall guys about one of our ISPs (Spectrum) accidentally turned off our circuit but it&#x27;s back up? Not related to this since Teams is pinned to Verizon currently but let me do some stuff to verify everything is OK. It is.
 03:00 Time to go back to bed...oh, Teams status has turned green. Light me double check. Ru-roh, we&#x27;re still down. curl -vk https://teams.microsoft.com is getting resets. Works from home to the same IP address.
 Fire up tcpdump on our outbound ISP load balancers (link controllers)...yep, we&#x27;re receiving RST packets from Microsoft -- i.e. they&#x27;re actively rejecting us for some reason sigh
 Should I mention we have zero, zilch, no access to our tenant and need to engage $corporateOverlords whose native language is not English for any information regarding anything hosted by Microsoft?
 Reconfigure the load balancer to send Teams traffic out our generic outbound Verizon IP instead of the one that is dedicated to Teams...we&#x27;re back up. 
 Email boss to tell him $corporateOverlords will need to look up the logs or contact Microsoft for an explanation.
 03:30 Ok, let&#x27;s see if I can unwind and catch some sleep...

                              <span>Hi!
 ​
 As some time did pass by since the Broadcom acquisition of VMWare, some of you did eventually move over to another product.
 ​
 ​
 I am still evaluating:
 XCP-ng
  
Offers 24/7 Enterprise support
 Has some performance limitations with single-threaded storage processes
 No application aware backups
 Active community
 Very responsive developer-team
  
​
 Proxmox
  
VERY limited enterprise support (austrian business hours)
 Very flexible storage backend support
 No application aware backups
 Active community
  
​
 I think, backups are an important point, that is not great for both solutions. A solution with limited enterprise support 
 ​
 What are your thoughts?
 ​
 Best wishes

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking at some previous collegues work history to see what paths they took and it feels like I have somehow had an unfair advantage and have moved up in my career much faster than others, yet I feel incredibly average and potentially below. Has anyone else felt this way? It&#x27;s like imposter syndrome but only because I&#x27;m doing better than some others.
 I can usually find the answer to any problem or work with the right people effectively to solve most issues but I feel like I&#x27;m lazy, I make mistakes, I don&#x27;t go after certifications, I don&#x27;t homelab, I have lukewarm social skills, I&#x27;m not amazing at interviews, I don&#x27;t network very well, my written skills are average at best, I can&#x27;t clearly state my thoughts to executives, and sometimes I&#x27;m just overall inefficient at my job. 
 Yet I know I&#x27;m capable of doing my current job without a doubt, but I worry about being replaced by someone better constantly.
 So when I see someone stuck in a T1 job for like 4 years, it makes me question whether or not I deserve to be in IT Manager role after only 6 years. It makes me think I&#x27;ve just relied on luck or white privilege this whole time.
 This is by no means bragging. I just want to know if anyone has felt this way before?

 First off, the only support our IT department will provide is rack space in uni server room, 23x7x365 power for any servers, and gigabit internet. Our attempts to get more help has/have been fruitless. So as a bioinformatician a.k.a pretty much the only people aware of computing in our department.
 We have the opportunity to upgrade our server infrastructure. Will be used predominantly for NGS (Exome + genome) data (No ML yet, but would like to keep options open).
 There is no fixed budget to work with - generally the lower the better. For the sake of post, lets consider 10 lakh INR (~12k USD) as the maximum budget.
 Usage - There are 3 bioinformaticians who use the servers, mainly for processing research WES/WGS data, but also running analysis us…</span>

                              <span>I know every environment is nuanced but what’s the simplest, cleanest way to offboard users? I’d love to be able to permanently retain departed c-suite data (email and OneDrive) while freeing up licensing, rest of staff data retained for a set time without licensing. Who out there has great automations in place that tend to these things in a systematic way where no one is having to log when user accounts can be unlicensed and/or deleted? What policies do you enforce to make the whole offboarding process simple, clear, and streamlined?
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hello.
 I&#x27;m planning on making some changes on a network, because we are short on ports.
 I have 2x Layer 3 core switches as cluster.
 There is very little inter-vlan routing on it.
 ​
 However, I have a lot of servers that are connected with SFP modules.
 To avoid having to additionally buy 2x very expensive layer 3 core switches, I would like to buy 2x layer 2 switches with 24 SFP ports for the servers.
 I would then connect them redundantly to the core switches as distribution layer.
 ​
 At least that was my idea.
 However, I can&#x27;t find any Layer 2 switches with more than 4 SFP ports at all.
 Do such devices even exist, and if not, why?

                              <span>I&#x27;m walking our property with a fiber vendor and two of our closets have multimode patch cables to the access switches but the actual fiber run to the patch panel is single mode.
 We&#x27;ve had probably 30+ accesses switches with multimode fiber running without issues for longer than I&#x27;ve been here. No errors or oddities I&#x27;ve seen on the connections. 
 To test this, I did hook up a switch using single mode optics/fiber and sure enough it connected. No errors on the port etc.
 Does anyone know the technical reason this works? I would assume there would be bigger issues due to the diameter size of the cabling differences?
 edited for some clarity.

 I&#x27;ve worked with computers in many different ways for well over two decades. I use Linux at home, proxmox for my home serving needs, I wrote my companies entire ERP system from scratch that connects with thermal label printers, QR code generation, time management, inventory management etc. all of it on the LAMP stack ... I am familiar with technology.
 Enterprise networking is a bit of black box to me though and I am trying to make some changes to the systems here and am confused whether or not I truly don&#x27;t understand professional grade networking OR the people who built out the network here are complete idiots. 
 Please help me figure out which is which.

                              <span>I have to run a coax line and I am need some advice on the specs of the cable I should use and what to expect for performance.
 We are getting 1000 Mb/s cable internet dropped to a pole on the property and it will be my responsibility to bring it into the building and get it to the network cabinet.
 There is an existing 3/4 underground conduit that I will be using which might limit me to RG6 rather than RG11.
 The run will be around 150&#x27; of underground conduit and then 150&#x27; of running inside the building to the network cabinet.
 Will 300&#x27; of coax cable potentially give me loss issues? Am I overthinking this, can I just grab a 300&#x27; roll of RG6 copper clad steel cable from Home Depot and send it? 
 I also have the option of putting the cable modem in the building right where the coax enters and then go with 150&#x27; cat6 back to the cabinet but I&#x27;d like to avoid this option as I would much rather keep the modem with all the other network stuff.
 Any advice?

                              <span>I live in sweden and we have &quot;city networks&quot; which are owners of the fibre network municipaly and the middle man between customer and ISPs
 The city network in my are assigns a Vlan per customer which easily adds up to over 4096. They do this so the can authenticate every users traffic to a RADIUS server which returns what ISP that customer has a contract with ( which also allows us to choose between many diffrent ISPs). 
 What i was wondering is what they use to make sure they have enough Vlans. Double/tripple tagging or Q-in-Q? If so which would be more efficent for a network running up to 200 000 Vlans? 
 Wouldn&#x27;t a tagging method use up a lot of processing power to tag/untag
 Does anyone have experience with these kinds of network structures?

                              <span>I am working on a design proposal to connect multiple customer&#x27;s networks to AWS using IPSEC S2S VPNs. This is straightforward for the most part. Establish VPN tunnels between AWS and the router. I am wondering if an alternative design might work where we configure a device (such as a Juniper SRX320 -- but open to other device suggestions) and ship it out to the customer with instructions to plug cable A into a network with internet access (such as a guest network) and cable B into the target network. Can the device behave as a standard client on the B interface (including receiving a DHCP address) but still allow AWS traffic to access devices on the network without being the default gateway for that network? The reason for this approach is it would simplify establishing VPN connections for customers as they would simply have to plug a device in instead of adding VPN configuration to their router.

I been studying for 4 years now, I been working net eng 1.5 years, i worked in 3 top companies in their relative industry on the country level, so i consider my self very lucky to start from startline with being network engineer, currently im sr. Net eng, i been in this position for 4 months it&#x27;s really boring, my whole career i worked on countless projects none of them are complex all of them were too basic for my taste, I&#x27;m really good network engineer i got the companies i worked in out of huge jams faster than most sr. Net engs there with 10+ years experience, my current job took boring to another level, i really started losing interest in networking, I&#x27;m thinking maybe i will get in pen testing starting with OSCP i already have solid networking and programming knowledge, but just in case i find 3-5 years from now i made a mistake, can i get back to networking? Will it be possible without getting my salary jabed?

                              <span>We have an MPLS circuit which terminates into our core switch (Cisco Nexus) via ethernet. On our Nexus, we have an IP assigned to the ethernet port plugs into.
 I recently added a second Nexus and connected it to the original via vPC. We will not add a second MPLS link to this switch, but would like to add it as a BGP peer to the carrier. Is there a best practice or suggested &quot;port&quot; to configure the IP address used for peering in this scenario?

                              <span>IPSec tunnel connection will only establish if the tunnel is restarted. It stays connected if there is traffic. Without traffic for a certain amount of time the connection is lost, although the tunnel still shows connected. We are waiting for the other site to add an IP for tunnel monitoring, but I am curious if anyone here has any ideas for what could be happening.
 Edit: something to add are this is a PAN connecting to SonicWall, but we are already setup for Proxy ID&#x27;s.

 But what I don&#x27;t know is can I still purchase the -R / -IR licenses for it?

                              <span>Hi,
 Let&#x27;s say I want to bind my server so that it ONLY listens on my subnet, and not accessible via public IP. If it is bound to 0.0.0.0 then it would bind to all available adresses, but I would like it to bind to the LAN IP only. If I already know my Local IP then that is easy enough, but it can change due to DHCP. I am testing this on a python3 simpleHttpServer like this
 python -m http.server 8080 --bind 192.168.0.0/24
 But this does not work. Is this a limitation of this python module?

 We have a /22 of ipv4 addresses that we no longer need and I am wondering if interlir.com and other similar platforms actually work or if there is any actual demand for these subnets? 
 Does anyone have any experience with leasing out ipv4 subnets?

 ​
 There is &quot;show route next-hop X.X.X.X&quot; but that only show routes with specific next-hop that are best paths as per bgp path selection and get installed in rib. What if you wanted to show all received bgp routes (best or not best) that have the next-hop X.X.X.X? Can this be done without grepping or using include through a full bgp table?

 Please advise about the design
 current design is a leaf border design

                              <span>Hello there, I have a PC connected to the internet and then another lan network that is offline for security purposes. So far passing files from one to another is done using usb drives. I was thinking of connecting the PC with the internet to one of the PCs in the offline network and use a simple ftp server using Python scripts to automate this process. 
 Now the question is, will that beat the purpose of the &quot;offline&quot; lan network security? Is there any standard way of keeping the Internet and the lan network fully seperate, like transfer the files ONLY through the python script and keep the lan network invisible from the Internet. Or no matter what I do, there will always be vulnerabillities and the 2 networks can&#x27;t be truly seperate once a there is a wired connection between them?

 I was wondering how to resolve this issue
 Summary: server is receiving the syn packet but is not responding with syn/ack packets
 I have already checked the following:
  
Ports are listening/open
 No iptables/firewalld/SELinux blocking the connection
 No changes to OS level prior to the issue.
  
I have been reading that turning off the TCP timestamp resolved this issue. However, I am concerned as this may have performance consequences. 
 Appreciate any response. Thanks!

                              <span>I have a NVR located in one building on the property, but I want to view the HDMI output of the NVR (NOT the networking output - When viewed over internet/network as the NVR is designed, I do not get the motion and recording icons on screen, the internal gui displays the icons on the local display but not over network viewing). I know there has to be some sort of hardware out there that I can connect and bing.... bam.... boom.... right? 
 The networking is via firewall via ISP, everything in these buildings are on the same network even tho we arent directly connected.
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m relatively certain I know the answer on this one, but wanted to get some outside confirmation - a type 2 route redistribution into OSPF will have a flat metric throughout the OSPF topology (1 if redistributing from BGP, 20 if redistributing from anything else, at least for Cisco&#x27;s implementation). 
 In contrast, for type 1 routes, the router doing the redistribution into OSPF doesn&#x27;t try to add any cost based on the protocol it&#x27;s being redistributed from. Say router XYZ is redistributing a static route to 5.5.5.0/24 as a type 1 route. Would it be correct to say that other OSPF routers in the topology calculate the metric for 5.5.5.0/24 based on their cost to reach router XYZ, and that router XYZ&#x27;s perceived metric to reach 5.5.5.0/24 doesn&#x27;t matter (static routes seem to have a &quot;metric&quot; in show ip route of 0 anyway)? If you had your reference bandwidth set to 10g, it wouldn&#x27;t matter if the static route to 5.5.5.0/24 had a next-hop address associated with an interface running at 10g, 1g, or 100m; the OSPF topology is only considering the cost to reach router XYZ, and router XYZ won&#x27;t try to artificially inflate the OSPF cost if the bandwidth on that interface changes.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m sort of looking at where to start here. I&#x27;m doing some labbing and want to set up a network that utilizes some VPNS that will be using certificates for the user and device authentication. Most all of my experience is simply with shared secrets. I&#x27;ve gone through security training and know what most of the components of PKI are individually, and I&#x27;ve generated certs in small projects before. However, getting an idea of how this infrastructure would be built and maintained well is kind of beyond me. 
 ​
 Can anyone recommend some good resources to go through that would give me a good idea of what I need to build up, and how it would all sort of function together? It seems like it&#x27;s that odd part that isn&#x27;t networking but plenty of times it&#x27;s our responsibility.

                              <span>This is my 3rd year as a network engineer. Worked two years in public transport where it was wild. Nothing was standard, alerting all over the place, I got to do all sorts of cool things. Worked on my own automation projects, build redundancy in for offices, actually saw things that could be improved, proposed the solutions and was given the green light. Felt I was actually contributing and making a difference, it was hectic however it was also fun.
 I ended up quitting in august 2021 to study and travel. Got my CCNP and got a job at a large financial company. Everything here is so dialed in that I ssh into a device maybe twice a week. Haven’t even needed a console cable cause our OOB is setup well. Everything is automated, alerting on point and Im realizing how green I am because I have zero ideas of how to improve anything. I find myself only really sending emails, working with vendors to get gear, ISPs to get circuits, plan office expansions and never ending meetings. I feel I don’t actually do any networking stuff. Spoke to my manager about this and he said ‘welcome to being a senior engineer….’ Not only am I in no way a senior but is this really the future of this career path? I am finding it so boring and have none of that tinkering/ trying to get something to work. 
 I understand my job is to provide reliable network access, but holy hell is it boring when it all works well…..

                              <span>I am trying to build a sub interface on our Cisco XR like this (cli):
 interface HundredGigE0/0/0/0.3106 description test vrf testvrf ipv4 address 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.254 encapsulation dot1q 3106 
 Seems straightforward enough, but I have been down the yang road before and its actually not as straightforward as I would think.
 How does one go about actually building a netconf xml based yang model for this? From what I understand you need to determine which yang structures should be used to build your xml netconf from. I found that the openconfig interface yang model does everything I need except applying a vrf to the interface. Then I found Cisco-IOS-XR-ifmgr-cfg, however this yang model has way more settings its not very clear how I use this model properly to create the above interface…</span>

                              <span>**EDIT** 
 We took a capture from the F5&#x27;s during the failover. There is no ARP being sent from the PA. When an F5 BIG-IP fails over, it will GARP, finding the routers Gateway. This will fulfill the PA&#x27;s ARP table. After 30 minutes exactly (the ARP cache refresh timer) the PA will drop the entry because it will not send an ARP for the F5 virtual-server IP. Basically, we&#x27;re only seeing connectivity at failover due to the F5 GARP for the router&#x27;s Gateway IP. 
 Has anyone ever experienced a Palo Alto not sending ARP for a singular IP on a subnet before? Or, could someone maybe explain why this is happening?

                              <span>I have been building these pfsense boxes. I have never really had a need for high bandwidth IPsec threw-put before. 
 Now I am getting into needing it. But I cannot figure out what about a box determines the amount of bandwidth it is capable of. 
 Like CPU load can be very low and it will not pass that much traffic. Then looking at premade appliances it seems the cpu is not that important to the amount of threw-put a box is capable of. 
 So my question is, if the cpu is not doing the cyphering then what is?

 I am looking to move away from Unifi as I build out a new SMB. I was asked about Engenius and wanted to check here what do you all think about Engenius for the switch and APs? The SMB is very small and not looking at the HPC/Dell/Cisco price range of gear.
 Thanks

                              <span>Currently we have 3 FTD&#x27;s total in our network. 2 in a HA transparent in front of our firewalls to act strictly as a IPS. This was a impromptu solution to losing our IPS. The 3rd FTD is a routed firewall in our equinix location. Currently I have a rule on the FMC that says any zone any source any destination with the application Spotify set to Block. 
 I would figure that rules would follow the top down pattern and say if its not spotify traffic then move it along to the next rule. Instead whenever I do a packet tracer it hits that rule with a allow on about any piece of traffic I do... So basically its a permit ip any any. 
 What am I doing wrong ?

 An admin has requested all the VMWare hosts pass jumbo mtu. I understand I need to enable jumbo mtu on all VMW vswitches, switch A and switch B. My question is where do I stop ? I am thinking I should not enable jumbo MTU at the uplink from switch B -- switch C. Will this cause switch C to drop packets from switch B?

                              <span>Might be the wrong subreddit just firing this one off in the dark. My use case is that I have a giant pile of switches where in the MAC of the inband interface is one digit increase of the 10/100 MGMT interface. 
 Lets say the 10/100 ends 5D, the inband is 5E and so on. I only have in inventory the 10/100 mac for each switch, but I need to do a DHCP hardware reservation for the inband. Does anyone in the OUI realm know if the +1 integer HEX increase is standard industry wide? So if I have say a MAC ending in AF the next in line will be B0? What happens when you get to FF? Do vendors just increase the value in the next bit and then start at 00? I would assume they have to?

                              <span>So, taking a cursory glance at Zero Trust as a replacement for our current VPN setup. I get the security aspect and how it does more to authenticate users and devices than just saying &quot;Oh you&#x27;re on the domain? You&#x27;re good.&quot; However, it seems to be purely security. I don&#x27;t see how it actually connects you to the network? It looks more like something you would use in tandem with a VPN, but everyone talks about it as a one or the other type of thing.

                              <span>I am having an issue with the BGP failover and trying to find the best way to solve it. Topology is here: https://ibb.co/myN4xXn
 I did not design this network, I inherited it. My knowledge of BGP is shallow but I used it successfully in many simple networks.
 Site 2 uses Site 1&#x27;s ExpressRoute to reach Azure when MPLS and Site 1&#x27;s ExpressRoute are available. When not site 2 uses direct site to site VPN tunnel to reach Azure. Failover and failback work correctly when MPLS fails, but I am running into issues when ExpressRoute fails. When ExpressRoute fails Site 1 still advertises routes to Site 2 because it learns them through Site 1&#x27;s site to site VPN. I don&#x27;t want that.
 Site 2 uses weight to prioritize &quot;MPLS&quot; over Site to Site VPN to Azure. In Azure I am pre-pending AS to make one path less desirable.
 What I simply want to do is prevent Site 1 from advertising Azure routes to site 2 when they are learned through Site to Site VPN, but for some reason I can&#x27;t wrap my head on how to do that. I know I need to use a route-maps to do it, but how to configure the route map and where to apply it is the question.
 Conceptually I think I need to first tag/identify routes when they are learned through site to site VPN Azure BGP neighbor, and then I need to deny those routes from being advertised to site 2.
 Right now I am using same route-map on site 1 for both Azure BGP neighbors. I think I will need to split that and use different route-map for each neighbor. 
 It seems that I can use &quot;community&quot;, &quot;origin&quot;, &quot;tag&quot;, and &quot;route-tag&quot; to make routes from one neighbor different than others.
 On premise equipment are FortiGate firewalls and ideally I like to make all changes on them. I want to avoid, if possible, to make changes in Azure.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve got a branch with a single core switch, and an HA firewall pair (yeah, I know). I want to implement the below design, where the core switch would be connected with trunk ports to the INSIDE interfaces of both firewalls, then the OUTSIDE interfaces would come back to the core switch on access ports on VLAN X, and we connect to the ISP on an access port on VLAN X. We do &quot;sw mode access&quot; and &quot;sw nonegatiate&quot; on those OUTSIDE switch interfaces and, of course, prune VLAN X from the trunks to mitigate VLAN attacks.
 https://www.ccexpert.us/firewall-config/switch-2.html
 I have been told by my colleagues that our IA people will freak out, and will not accept having the INSIDE and OUTSIDE networks on the same hardware. Does anyone know of any documentation, or design guides, or proof of concepts from reputable sources that I can take to convince them this is a secure design?
 Conversely, if someone knows a specific exploit that makes this unsecure, please share.

 NOTE: Red is the attackers IP, Black my local IP (redacted due to privacy).
 I also had to rename the wireshark.exe, since the virus won&#x27;t run if Wireshark is open.

 I’m a networking engineer with 9 years of experience, I have a bachelor degree and I a lot of minor networking certifications (Meraki, Sophos, Aerohive(now extreme), Mojo(Now Arista)).
 Also I’m good with automation and I feel comfortable with programming languages.
 I’ve been designing enterprise networks a lot of years but I think I need to move to the next step in my career.
 Which certifications or moves you think I must take in order to get to the next level?
 Kind regards!

                              <span>Hoping this community has a solution for our need. We run a network on a military installation for personal use internet connectivity. We need a means to test internet speeds at about 10 buildings of the 200 we are connected via cable, switches and PTP radios. We have a 1Gb broadband connection which we give soldiers 50 down and 2 up. Last year we decided to try it with Raspberry pi4’s but they seem impossible to get our hands on anymore. We did get 2 last year and loaded with speedtest cli. We distributed these to two buildings and it works flawlessly. Getting old laptops or old pc’s running in attics would work but I’m looking for something small like a raspberry that I can plug into a switch in an attic get my stats and dump them into g drive. Or perhaps there is a small IOT device that is purpose build to do that. I’m trying to stay in raspberry pricing per unit. Any ideas?

                              <span>Hey guys, long time lurker short time poster - forgive me for formatting. We have a strange issue TAC support are taking weeks to resolve (even as a P2 ticket), I wondered if anyone else has experienced this issue. 
 We have 250 APs, around 12 of those are R500 the rest R510. These are connected to a vSZ controller with non-proxied radius requests. A couple times a day, the entire cluster will drop connections and no one regardless of PSK SSID or an 802.1x SSID can connect. In this time, you cannot SSH into an AP and invariably you cannot SSH into the vSZ either. Ruckus Support seem to be having problems pinpointing the issue in logs and have repeatedly asked for logs between 3-5 mins after the issue occurs. Our controller is running 6.1.0.0.935, R510 running 6.1.0.0.1595 and R500 5.2.1.0.1038 
 We see a lot of AP-Disconnected events along with RADIUS server unreachable at the time of the incident. Has anyone experienced this issue themselves?

 What I did:
 Windows 10 updates
 Defender scan
 Uninstalled a lot of old or unrecognizable apps and services (using Services and Process Explorer)
 removed other active user (postgre) through PowerShell
 ​
 ESET Online Scanner (full scan)
 Kaspersky Virus Removal Tool
 Emsisoft Emergency Kit (full scan)
 ESET SysInspector

 OS reinstall is an easiest solution but that is not an option now.

 This is just a desktop without local network.
 What else I can check to track why PC acts like this.

 PS. Also, there are 2 wifi routers in cascade with 2 different NATs. This is happening for a main router (which is connected to modem). When switching wifi to secondary wifi router (connected to LAN port of primary router) than issue disappear.

                              <span>I have 2 domains, exchange server in 1 domain A that handles email for both A and B AD domains, but all users re behind the same @company.com. It&#x27;s been fine for few years as-is, as was the user. I now have that 1 user that is constantly being locked out in AD and the source is the email server, the user is in domain B. I have no clue if it matters... 
  
I deleted all of his activesync devices
 he only has 1 issued company smartphone and I deleted the email on there
 I recreated his outlook profile on his desktop. 
 I&#x27;ve disabled his activesync access in ECP
 I&#x27;ve disabled OWA in ECP
  
Because of the 2 domains I use the linked AD accounts, but again, that has not been an issue in many years and it&#x27;s just 1 user being affected so I&#x27;m not inclined to think something else is messed up.

                              <span>I took over Listserv administration about a year ago when I started my role as Sysadmin. It’s just a massive mess I’m trying to go through and cleanup inactive lists, etc. 
 We have a lot of issues specifically with Gmail having significant delays with delivery that were looked at by others in the role before me. Ultimately we want to get rid of Listserv as even their cloud option isn’t cheap. Are there any good alternatives out there others have used? I found Gaggle Mail, which sounds like a good potential replacement but I need to research it further.
 I’m curious to know other’s experience or if they’ve used something else.

I saw an opportunity to replace our current EDR (ESET) for Microsoft Defender for Endpoint. However, I&#x27;m somewhat overwhelmed with all of the settings that can be set. The more I read, the deeper the rabbit hole seems to go. Note that this is for a small company that doesn&#x27;t have any industry-specific cyber security regulations though certain regulations are stipulated in the insurance we have for potential cyber attacks. There are some obvious settings that should be turned on, but I&#x27;m not finding any particular guides online for a minimum secure configuration. Anyone have any helpful resources?

                              <span>We don&#x27;t want to disable IPv6, but we want to disable systems requesting DHCP configuration over iPv6.
 I know it can be set by running a command on each system:
 Set-NetIPInterface -AddressFamily IPv6 -InterfaceIndex $(Get-NetIPInterface -AddressFamily IPv6 | Select-Object -ExpandProperty InterfaceIndex) -RouterDiscovery Disabled -Dhcp Disabled
 However, if we did that, we would have no reporting or auditing showing the current status of each system.
 Is there a GPO or registry setting for Windows that accomplishes the same thing so that the configuration can be easily audited?

                              <span>I have been in IT for more than 25 years, and had about a dozen jobs in various companies/industries of different sizes. I never really liked IT, but was generally good at it and it paid well. The best jobs are when I had a fun team, worst have been from bad management. I eventually change jobs for whatever reason: company closing, management, bored, whatever. I have always thought about changing professions during my career, but I don’t know if I would feel better doing that or not. Or have any idea what I would do anyway. I don’t like the idea of continually changing jobs, especially in my 50s, I average about 2-3 years per job, but I am pretty sure I am not in the right place to finish my career in 15-20 years.
 I never felt fulfilled or proud of my career path, and dread mondays and going into the office 3 times a week, but the days go by quickly given that every day is different. All in all, things are ok, I’m hybrid, get paid well, little work outside my 40 hours, my management leaves me alone, I’ve always gotten good reviews when I had them. I don’t really connect with my team, and fear I would be released if layoffs come. Some days, it’s a struggle staying above water from both the complexity and quantity of work, most days I stare at the clock waiting for quitting time.
 For the most part I’ve been an admin: windows, linux, storage, virtualization, cloud, and dabbled a bit in of security, databases, scripting, networking. Not sure if I should stay where I am, switch to a similar job as admin, change to something like IT security , or change careers entirely.
 Where are you at? Experiencing the same feelings? Am I burnt out or being whiny?

                              <span>I find that I get along really great with my end users and I can explain most of the issues in layman&#x27;s terms but when working on a larger team of system engineers or very techy people they look at me like I am an idiot or I just do not mesh well with them.
 I had a job for three months with an MSP and none of the techs liked me there. I got fired due to culture fit. At my current job I am bashing with my bosses boss as well as an app consultant because I am asking questions or detailing the frustrations that the users have with our equipment and software when it seems like nothing is getting fixed.
 How do you learn how to keep your head down and work with technologies or even people you think are inferior? Is it the fact that I don&#x27;t have the knowledge that I think I do? Is it the politics of crappy workplaces? I have 8-10 years of IT exp and still generally help desk support at various roles/companies, could that be the reason? 
 Why do I think IT should be about investigating problems and making sure they get fixed and do not reoccur when in reality it is actually about putting bandaids on things until you can&#x27;t take it anymore and leave? I guess this is why they call hell desk hell. Even though I generally don&#x27;t have the problem with dealing with users like most people lolz.

                              <span>Hi guys. Our company is evaluating the transition from on prem servers to cloud servers, and I&#x27;d like to ask for your advice. Our current environment includes 2 sites while each site has 1 Windows server (to work as DC, DHCP and print server) + 1 Windows file server. GPOs are in place to mount network drives and printers. We also have NSA to work as firewalls and VPN connections for remote users.
 Our major plan is to replace the file servers with Nasuni edge appliances. That will bring us &#x27;small cache file server&#x27; to each location. But the executives are considering replacing the current DCs to cloud VM. 
 From my premature understanding of cloud resources, this looks possible by running a VM with site-to-site VPN connection to on prem networks. Remote users will still connect VPN before they could reach the DC for authentication. But would there be any issues/concerns for the features like AD, printing, DNS, GPO, etc.?

                              <span>Hey guys, the Intune environment of our company is quite messy, and we searched for a solution for a short while to help us with uncluttering it.
 This program uses the ms-graph api to get all the apps, configuration policies etc. and displays the result in a GUI. You can even export your findings.
 From a safety aspect u probably should get a c# programmer to look into it, before using it in your main tenant. But I tried it on our test tenant and it just worked. (and ofc I only gave the user I used a read-only role)

 This might really help other folks with cluttered environments, to find things that aren&#x27;t even used or assigned to anything, so I thought I share this discovery :)

                              <span>Hi sysadmins! Hope you are doing well.
 ​
 I have some printers in my Active Directory, and users are adding them through the directory. 
 ​
 When they are added, the server hosting the shared printers is generating MANY 4624 Event IDs, specifying &quot;An account was successfully logged on.&quot;, even if the users are not printing anything... 
 ​
 Is that some sort of connection status check ? And is there anyway to customize/disable it ?

 I do remember doing an Active directory cleanup a few weeks back but I do not know what is the account associated with the software. I can&#x27;t restore deleted accounts in Active Directory because our systems aren&#x27;t able to do that. 
 Here is the error:

                              <span>Morning,
 I was asked to take a look at the bill a customer is receiving from the local phone/internet company. I actually don&#x27;t know what is normal for these, I don&#x27;t typically see the bill, and was hoping for some help.
 They have dedicated fiber and there are two spots on the bill that lists our circuit number. I&#x27;ll alter the numbers slightly but leave the ratio between the two amounts.
 The first item says &quot;Dedicated Internet&quot; and is 800.00 That makes sense to me.
 The second line items says &quot;Megalink Port per DS1 Rental Period of 36&quot; and is 650.00
 Not sure what that second one is. Is that a rental for their gear? Is that normal? 
 We have the typical small box from the carrier with our circuit on it with the cables coming in from somewhere in the building to it with a Cat6 cable hanging off it we plug into our firewall. I hope we are not renting that.

                              <span>Good morning. I&#x27;m looking for a affordable image tool. I&#x27;d like to create one or two images that include all the apps we use, and then just deploy those with minor tweaks.
 All the tools I&#x27;ve seen are for endpoint management and are therefore expensive. We don&#x27;t need all that jazz.
 Are there affordable tools out there that you use? Seems like everyone wants $20/machine or $1000 a year.
 I readied 100 machines last year. Took too much time.
 I tried getting WDS/MDT going, and got about 90% there but am having authentication issues when it comes to accessing the share in WinPE.

 So far, my attempts to reach out to them directly have been unsuccessful. :(
 Edit: 
 As an example, DMARC Analyzer uses &quot;rep.dmarcanalyzer.com&quot; for their RUA ingestion, which is published in any customer&#x27;s DMARC record.

 Currently, I have Google Cloud Sync up and running syncing my domain users from our on-premise Active Directory to Google (so far so good!)
 Then I have setup Google Password Sync to sync the passwords for our users. 
  
I change password for a user in my AD
 The user can now sign in to admin.google.com fx
 The new password just set in the AD works, but after the user signed in it will instantly prompt users to change password again?
 I would want it to not prompt the user to change password online in Google after the password is set in the AD, does anybody have a clue on what setting to look at here :) ?

 I want to enroll Hybrid Azure AD Joined devices to Intune, but it is not working for some reason...The HAADJ devices already have Microsoft Defender for Endpoint pushed through GPO and these devices are showing up in Intune. In Azure AD, it says that the MDM used by the device is Intune but in the Endpoint Manager portal, it says MDE (Managed by column).
 My configuration looks good, but the devices still doesn&#x27;t get enroll in Intune because they have been MDE onboarded before.
 So, to go from MDE to a real Intune enrollment, do I need to wipe the device, or a better solution exist, I can&#x27;t find the solution...
 Thank you very much for the help!

                              <span>I&#x27;m enabling Windows Hello from Endpoint Manager using a Configuration Profile (so I can do a staggered deployment).
 When I add a user to the Configuration Profile it eventually asks them to reboot, then they try to login and it asks them to setup Windows Hello. Once they complete the setup they try and enter the PIN they just set and get “This option is currently unavailable” and they can only login with their domain password.
 After a bit of time the PIN suddenly starts working and I have no idea why.
 This is a hybrid environment so I suspect a password sync needs to happen before Windows Hello will work properly.

                              <span>Good day
 I have a client that has an engineer working from abroad. This person connects to a virtual machine on a server that shares an NVIDIA Tesla GPU to draw CAD models. If the engineer is on-site at the office, connection is established through a site-to-site VPN. If he works from home, he dials in to the main office through client VPN. Ping ranges from 200 to 250 ms.
 The performance of the virtual machine is sufficient, but since we are using RDP there are significant limitations to the user experience. Manipulating models or watching videos is - as you may expect - laggy and not very pleasant.
 I followed this manual and allowed H.264/AVC hardware encoding in the local group policies of the machine. There is a significant improvement compared to the regular RDP settins. Can you think of other ways to boost the user experience when working over RDP? How do I get the most out of this protocol? Thanks for all the suggestions.
 Before you bash me for this setup - it was not my idea - I inherited the setup from my predecessor.

                              <span>I have been given the following openvpn config exported from a pfsense machine along with the .p12 and .key files.

 So far (almost half a year) I&#x27;ve used to connect to the vpn by just providing a username and a password. Today When I tried to connect, it asked me also for private key password which I don&#x27;t know which it is. 
 Is there something need to be changed in the config due to some openvpn update or something is going bad?
 My openvpn version is :
 OpenVPN 2.5.8 [git:makepkg/0357ceb877687faa+] x86_64-pc-linux-gnu [SSL (OpenSSL)] [LZO] [LZ4] [EPOLL] [PKCS11] [MH/PKTINFO] [AEAD] built on Nov 1 2022 library versions: OpenSSL 3.0.7 1 Nov 2022, LZO 2.10 
 Any idea is welcome. I&#x27;m asking here because a couple of months ago our IT has left the company :-/

 The ad agency has about 60 users. There is no central office location. Staff is using all sorts of software. Any approach to bring things together and stream line things?

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Everyone was super helpful on my last post - 👍.
 Just have a support ticket in regarding the LinkedIn Sales Navigator intergration for our CRM org. 
 Issue seems to be it isn&#x27;t loading some of the details when used in Outlook on the Web, but it&#x27;s fine on the app. Tried a few searches but not getting much specific to my case. Already tried basics like cache and ingonito etc.

 Thanks in advance everyone.

From what I&#x27;ve seen online i can just replace the boot.wim and install.wim files in order to do so. How can I format my USB stick into NTFS to put the image on as its 15GB as Windows PE automatically formats it to FAT32

                              <span>Just a strange thing we have noticed and had some feedback from Microsoft on.
 In the past when you gave Full Access to a users mailbox through the GUI in Exchange to another user this did not allow the delegate to see Private Items this was always an additional setting within Outlook that the user would have to set.
 It seems now this has changed and that when you assign a delegate to a mailbox through the GUI this also gives that delegate access to the Users Private Items.
 I should add this seems to only have changed recently on Cloud Exchange
 Microsoft have confirmed seemingly this is by design which has actually raised a big concern of privacy.
 Has anyone else had anything similar?

                              <span>Namely, a person that is either directly or indirectly a part of IT, but whose responsibilities lie in being copied in emails and dropping their boilerplate wisdom every now and then. Instead of working on problems/projects, they solve them by using Outlook (getting someone else to do it). 
 I’ve had a place where I worked with a person like this, but currently, due to no fault of my own (policies and procedures) I see myself becoming a mailman.
 Have you noticed this phenomena? How do you approach working with colleagues like this? And what steps do you take to remove yourself from that kind of position if you see yourself in it?

 Right now, my organization has a network printer IP address in the source parameter of the configured firewall rules to the network addresses of the corporate network and the action is allow.
 I need to explain this firewall rule to the stakeholders that this rule is dangerous and shouldn&#x27;t be allowed by default because by right printer or server should not be able to initiate a requests .
 Who do I explain better in words with risks so that they get it? I tried to google information but leads to dead end.
 All helps are appreciated, thanks.

 It only works on about 30% of the machines. 
 Tried dism cab and wusa MSU neither worked reliably.
 Random error codes on dism exit that are impossible to source. 
 Any ideas?

 we&#x27;re facing some issues. Currently we&#x27;re running AWS Managed Active Directory with Pass-Through Auth to M365. Now we need to enable Hybrid Azure AD join.
 I got the error not a member of Enterprise Admins group (yes, it&#x27;s a managed AD, so you have no Enterprise Admin).
 Then I tried the ConfigureSCP.ps1 Script which the MS Agents suggest -&gt; Access Denied.
 I tried to update schema via AWS Console -&gt; only in CN&#x3D;Schema....
 Any suggestions, or has anybody got it working?

                              <span>Currently trying to double down on some bad practises we have on company PCs. I have removed all users as local admins on their PC, due to users installing some applications which are not work related.
 Some of these users are Technicians which go on client sites to troubleshoot products, which require them to change their Laptop NIC Card IP Address and install drivers. 
 I have solved the NIC Card issue by including their AD account in the &#x27;Network Configuration Operators&#x27; Local Group on each of their PCs respectively.
 The driver install problem I can&#x27;t seem to wrap my head around. They only need to install drivers from a specific vendor, lets call them &#x27;Vendor A&#x27;.
 Is there a way to enforce a GPO on these users, which allows them to install applications and drivers by &#x27;Vendor A&#x27; only without the need of admin credentials, while asking for admin credentials for any other app/driver install?
 I have searched the web for a solution and found there is a way to have trusted and untrusted publishers in an AD, but wasn&#x27;t able to make it work as I need it. 
 This is for around 10 users running Windows 10, connected to an AD installed on windows server 2016. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>dude, where is my phone?
 This article is gonna be the first in a series about my current project, taking a current-gen flagship phone beyond the mainstream schools of customization. I want a phone making good on all the vendor promises, I want mine not just to deliver all the cool features they were showing off in the commercial, I need mine to also respect my privacy and be reasonably secure. And it better do it in style and make me look like James Bond x Neo.
    
 down memory lane
 I&#x27;ve been playing with phones for some years now, I&#x27;ve been along for the ride when technology evolved from something the mainstream used at work to being part of everyone&#x27;s most intimate lives. To me, technology is there for both work and play, but when I buy a tool, I want it to work for me - not the other…</span>

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m pretty sure the answer to this will be no, but figured someone may have been in this spot before: so we use airwatch as an organisation and have recently given out new phones to remote users. The old ones have come back and the company wants to essentially wipe them and either give them to employees, or charity, as they are fully functional, just no longer fit for our site due to cyberessentials+
 Lucky me: the user&#x27;s don&#x27;t remember what pin numbers they had set on 3 of the phones and they had decided it was a good idea to make a random one (so IT can wipe the phone easier)... Then they forgot the code.. and the devices had already been deleted from airwatch....
 I&#x27;ve looked online and all I really see are jailbreakers and paid pin unlock suites, I&#x27;m wondering if anyone knows of a free tool that can either remove the pin, or fully factory reset the devices (I&#x27;ve tried iTunes and the usual recovery with no joy), or if there is a way to re-enroll the devices back into airwatch temporarily to use the pin removal tool?

 I honestly wake up every morning and enjoy the thought of going to work
 I work in health with a company that has about 40 sites and 1800 staff.
 I&#x27;ve got from servicedesk to business systems admin to Sys admin to Senior tech servicedesk L4
 I&#x27;ve had lots of opportunity to grow and move around teams to learn new things
 We have our share of issues, problem users and high pressure outages. But our manager has put together an awesome team, he allows us lots of freedom to work on whatever we feel like as long as the big jobs get done.
 There is hope out there, and there are really good jobs waiting. You just have to keep looking and checking out places

                              <span>Hello,
 I’m a sys admin in a team of three that own several applications as well as their hosting environments. I’m six months into this new job and have suddenly been thrown into a couple projects. 
 Unfortunately for me, my boss threw me into an ongoing project cycle due to one of our sys admins being out for several weeks, so I’m in the fire. I’ve been given a technical documentation by our vendor which I’m told is full of useless and confusing information and I need to basically decipher and translate it to work for the environment we have. I’m still new to our environment and applications so figuring out how to make this work within our infrastructure is extremely daunting. There are people I can ask for help but many of them are busy with their own tasks and projects and I don’t want to come off as helpless. 
 The company I work for is ridiculously understaffed and unorganized, so there is zero structure or timeline to these projects as well as very conflicting deadlines. I’ve literally been asked if it was possible to take this new project given to me and implement the entire thing in a non prod environment within 24 hours, no freaking way. All the while being asked by product managers and my boss for constant updates on other projects assigned to me. It’s extremely soul crushing. I’m so new to everything that it seems impossible to get anything done within the time frames they’re asking for and give updates. The micro managing is extremely severe to the point where I am asked for a project update every single hour, most of the time I’m still trying to figure out what to do and don’t have an answer. If I’m lucky one of the more senior guys will schedule a meeting with me later in the day to point me in the right direction. I’m starting to feel like I’m just not smart enough for this role and want out of IT completely because it seems like I run into this same issue with every job.

                              <span>I hate SCCM, never like it. It takes too much effort to maintain and it only works 50% of the time. 
 In saying that, Im trying to install Teams using Teams Wide Installer during a Task Sequence. It installs successfully and drops a Teams.exe in Program Files (x86) for a 64-bit installer and a registry key:
 Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run 
 Name : Teams Wide Machine Installer
 Type: Reg_Expand_SZ
 Value: %ProgramFiles%\Teams Installer\Teams.exe --checkInstall --source&#x3D;default
 So according to Microsoft Documentation : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/msi-deployment
 Whenever a user signs into new Windows user profile, the installer is launched and will install teams in %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Teams
 However, the user install does not happen. When the user logs in, they can find Teams anywhere. The only workaround to install teams is for them to to Program Files (x86)\Teams Installer and run Teams.exe. 
 This happens to all new builds and the user logs in for the first time. Anyone have similar experience or perhaps any SCCM guru that can shed some light on this? Any advice would be really appreciated

                              <span>We’re about to get a new server soon and I’m debating going to Hyper-v or not. We’re not a big shop, some on prem, some azure. Current server is esxi free and there is a dev server running the same. This server will replace both. 
 We have another set of servers that was deployed by our MSP as a hyper-v cluster before I joined and I’m not impressed. Things I can easily do in vSphere are either overly complicated or just don’t work as well. 
 The two things holding me back from going vSphere are keeping uniformity across systems and the uncertainty of the Broadcom deal. 
 I’ve got more experience with vSphere which is why I’m leaning that way and can easily justify the extra licensing on the cost our MSP would charge for all the migrations if we went hyper-v. 
 Any thoughts or advice?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve read a few posts here on reddit suggesting using sub domains when setting up a service that sends email on your domain&#x27;s behalf so you don&#x27;t reach the 10 DNS lookup limit and have to use a flattening service.
 I&#x27;m trying to find documentation that recommends using sub domains but can&#x27;t seem to find any good posts/examples on how to accomplish this.
 It would be great is someone can share some documentation or experience on how they went about accomplishing this.

                              <span>Does anyone have guidance on how to accomplish vCenter SSO/authentication with OpenLDAP utilizing email as the UID? The default setup strips the domain and tries to use the login or username as the UID instead of the full email. VMware support has not been helpful thus far.

                              <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;m transitioning into a networking role soon and will be dealing with a lot of phones and collaboration tools. This is all pretty new to me except I am familiar with basic networking. I&#x27;m looking for an all in one guide or video to learn the basics and get a good grasp before jumping off the deep end.
 I&#x27;ll be working with Teams (Direct Routing + Operator Connect), Zoom Phones, Cisco Call Manager, and some Vonage. I&#x27;ve already gone through some knowledge base articles with these vendors but I still don&#x27;t feel like I have a good baseline. I&#x27;m not looking for how to use these specifically more like what is a SBC, how do number translations work, what&#x27;s a SIP trunk, PTSN vs toll-free, etc. Anyone able to point me in the right direction for something like this?
 Thanks!!

 Can VMWare support help me? Can they brute force or somehow get past the root login if I pay the $300 PPI one time support cost?
 EDIT: The host machine is a Dell PowerEdge

 What certifications would you recommend for me? I still know how to manage networks and virtual machines. Did Azure REALLY take off? I just need some advice. Thank you.

                              <span>Definitely a rant, but I&#x27;ve noticed this most jobs other then those I&#x27;ve held in MSP or medical fields. As we speak, I am constantly being pinged by a new hire because no one is teaching him how do anything. I&#x27;m talking about functional things related to his job, like workflows, software tools beyond normal &quot;here is your computer, this is how you log on to the network and email&quot; type stuff. 
 Shouldn&#x27;t it logically be his team or supervisor teaching him? I only have a peripheral idea what/how they work, so I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m not 100% telling him the &quot;right way&quot;. I keep stressing that he needs to ask other people, but no one else is answering him. 
 I&#x27;d say it was an org issue, but it was this way to an extent at previous employer as well. I trained people across the organization there as well.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen many businesses converting over to using MSP&#x27;s and cutting IT departments. Personally, I enjoy working for a small/medium business or non-profit organization and have seen them start to utilize MSP&#x27;s rather than full-time IT. I was just curious if my experience with MSP&#x27;s is a trend/norm in our field or unique to my geographical area/size of business.

 Just caused a flash fire and horrible smell in front of a classroom of 32 fifth graders. They enjoyed it, the teacher and I did not.
 That is all
 Edit: No, the projector doesn’t work anymore. We recently got Interactive Boards so luckily I had plenty of extra projectors to replace it with.

 I&#x27;m trying not to rant or cry or moan about my job and what else, but I have a problem a lot of you can relate to.
 I&#x27;m 20 years old and just finished school. Very happy that I got to be a Sysadmin officially and love my job.
 Three months ago, I started working at a small company - we have around 30 people in our main building and another 15 in our logistics (majority is part-time &amp; don&#x27;t have access to computers or mail).
 At my first job interview with the company, I talked to H&amp;R and the external IT advisor. They told me that the old Sysadmin left the job months ago and have been without support for some time.
 They called him (let&#x27;s call him L) if there was no way they could&#x27;ve fixed the problems on their own (setting up new devices to the domain, add…</span>

 Server 2 - Proprietary financial system - SQL Server 2008

 - No, you cannot change corporate procedure. You and your new minions must still open a ticket or call the helpdesk. You cannot call me to speak “manager to manager” about Susie’s printer.
 - No, you cannot tell IT to buy your department all new laptops and pay for them out of IT’s budget. I don’t care what you promised your department.
 - No, you cannot buy unapproved hardware/software and demand IT install and support it. We will use our voodoo to block that crap and you cannot overrule us on this.
 - No, we will not make changes in our email filter so you can sell your MLM crap to your co-workers. Running a side business while using corporate assets is strictly forbidden in the employee handbook and managers don’t get exceptions.

So the RDG (Broker) is reachable and this part works fine. But the session, which i get from the broker, is an IP. From my understanding, this needs to be an FQDN/DNS, otherwise the certificate for the Session Server would be invalid. Anybody any insights, how i can force the Load balancer broker to offer me the hostname/FQDN/dns name of the session server? 
 Or should the Broker give me an hostname and i did something wrong?

                              <span>Hello Sysadmins,
 I am now IT support for a company of roughly 70 employees, with most of them being remote. We currently use google workspace as our domain.
 I’m looking for some tools that can scale as we grow so open to suggestions.
 Looking for software that can better manage devices in terms of updates, remote software to assist users, and internal ticketing.
 Thanks everyone!

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 First off I hate Mac&#x27;s for enterprise use. They are such a pain in the ass to manage. Anyways, we use openvpn and for some reason only Mac computers refuse to use the internal DNS. I can hit resources by IP but not by name and if I get on a Windows PC using the same VPN settings it works fine. I tried adding our DNS server in system settings on the mac but it still wont resolve names. Anyone else have this happen? How do I fix this?

 Quick one, don&#x27;t know where to post this.
 If I were to create a webapp/database with old Windows (XP and under) licence keys to make them searchable, would Microsoft come after me with a legal team?

                              <span>Hi there,
 I am a sysadmin in a company and I manage around ~170 Servers. Some of them are phyiscal, some virtual. Most of them run Windows Server 2012 / 2016 /2019 as their OS, but we also got some Linux Servers.
 So now our issue: We literally got almost no documention for our servers. We have list of our hostnames, but that is it.
 To better understand our current state: Recently our main FTP Server broke down because the Windows OS was broken. The server was not bootable anymore and therefore the config for the FTP server (IIS) was lost. Of course, no one knew how the FTP Service was configured in terms of directories, local users and other software. So we build up a new Server from scratch (which was the easy part) and talked to every service provider usising this FTP Server and telling them that the credentials and hostname / IP has changed (which was the not so nice part).
 We recently got the brilliant idea that it might be good to know what kind of Servers we have, which applications they are running and how they are configured.
 The first idea from one of my colleagues was to make a word document for every server, where we can wright the specs inside, which applications it runs and what steps were taken to configure the software (with screenshots). But yeah, let&#x27;s just not do that....
 And now my question: What is the best practice for Server documentation? I googled a bit of course and found some tools for documentation, but most of them are not free for testing or just don&#x27;t look that good to use.
 The way to document should have some kind automation to it and have a nice usability, so that my colleagues stay motivated to document.
 So should be just something dull like Word, Excel or Visio (which is easy but frustrating to use) or some kind of software, which scans our servers and document them? I think a hybrid of both things would be nice

                              <span>I have a question for publishing printers by site bsaed on the following design requirement:
 Implementing a print release system to use follow-me print across all sites.
 Management want just one print queue published
 We could publish one print queue from one server and allow the system to manage the follow-me function, but there&#x27;s also the requirement to ensure local print facilities are available in the case of a single site failure / link failure.
 It appears to be a limitation of the system we are using (or the design we&#x27;ve gone with) to have failover across sites - though I am also checking with our managed print provider, as I&#x27;m not the project manager just the technical lead.
 Currently using group policy, print perferences then item-level filtering to say if at X site then create printerX@serverX.com
 If at site Y create printerY@serverY.com etc.
 What I&#x27;d like to do is avoid a build up of printers in their list though, so if at site X I only want X printer deployed to that device. If they then take that laptop to site Y, deploy printer Y on login but remove printer X. The plan is the queue name would be the same on each server so to the end user it &quot;looks&quot; like one queue wherever they go
 Is that even possible? I worry it could increase logon times
 Any other suggestions?

 What are these and what are they for? I understand what DNS is or does. But I&#x27;ve never encountered such a solution before and was wondering if someone could explain to me, thanks

                              <span>We use shared local admin accounts with password auth on the infrastructure I inherited (~6 admins, many (hundreds) of machines). This worries me, any ex employee will still have access unless we go and change a lot of passwords. Automation is not really a thing here yet (I know, I know).
 Looking for a better solution I started to create an ansible playbook to roll out authentication via sssd/ldap. This basically works, everyone from the &quot;sysadmin&quot; group can now login via ssh and their individual passwords on my test machine. Accounts are automatically granted sudo rights based on group membership.
 Now, I have a couple of questions with respect to this approach:
  
Is there a way to preseed the sssd cache before first login? An admin might have to handle an emergency on a machine he’s never logged into and at that moment ldap might not be available. If not, any recommended alternative approaches?
 
I would prefer key auth over passwords but I don’t have much control over the AD/LDAP infrastructure so I don’t think I can store public keys there (and delegate ssh key lookup / caching to sssd). I could rollout and revoke keys via ansible but I’m unsure on how that would play with sssd/ldap. Like, when an account is locked in AD but still has an authorized key, can they still login?
 
Given all admins have sudo rights, what would be required steps to make sure they can&#x27;t access servers after they left? E.g. would we have to cleanout their authorized_keys in addition to disabling their users in AD/LDAP?
 
 Any inputs are appreciated.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve a frontend server with fpm 8.1 and nginx.
 2 cores and 4gb of RAM.
 A few days ago I upgraded from 18.04 to 22.04. I&#x27;ve kept the php fpm and cli version and did not change any fpm settings.
 Since the upgrade fpm consumes on average more cpu and I even run into issues that the fpm pools cant work the requests and I receive timeouts. 
 I can see that the load is close to 0 in the night when I dont have any traffic. And my traffic did not change in a way since the upgrade that might explain the higher need of cpu. 
 Is there any known issue regarding this? Any other package versions that come with 22.04 that might interfere with fpm?
 Thank you!

                              <span>Soon we are going to be migrating emails from IMAP server to existing 365 environments for a client. 100+ users. I&#x27;m trying to figure out amount of time needed for manual intervention on every affected machine. 
 So I&#x27;m not asking about how to migrate the emails, but steps needed to finalise user environments to &quot;ready to use&quot; state. If it&#x27;s still not clear, these are few things I have in mind:
  
windows updates
 
office365 update / installation of apps,most importantly outlook
 
do I need to remove and re-add outlook profile for each user? Or is this not an issue?
 
anything else?
 
 Any advice is appreciated. I will provide more info if needed

                              <span>I have a ProLiant DL380 Gen9 that currently has two SATA disks in the two first two slots, and these are setup as RAID 1 via the Smart Array P440ar controller.
 When I look at the slots from outside the first two from left are used:
 [X][X][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 
 We want to insert another RAID 1 pair. Which slots should be used? Would 3 and 4 work fine, or would it for some reason be better to use e.g. 5 and 6? (If it matters, please also explain why.)

                              <span>I am in a growing startup, 30~ employees so far, using terraform as an AD with GSuite and manual account management to all the services that don&#x27;t support terraform for user management.
 I have no idea how to make sure that the services that we use are managed from somewhere central. I have seen some stuff can be done by playing around with SAML SSO and organisation setup in GSuite, but even like that, most of the services don&#x27;t use SAML SSO, and most of them don&#x27;t have API&#x27;s.
 So, how do you manage all the services your company uses and the permissions within them?

He is paralyzed of unknown outcomes of making autonomous decisions on devices or design..again never fully understanding on what he is doing in grand picture, or coming to that state of understanding slowly, often after consulting with others rather than exempting it from documentation, design maps, combined with general tech behavior available to be studied on internet.. not his first nature ..he is config implementer, now having offer for being design auditor..he has given my details to firm already..really having hard time what to write to not sabotage him, nor being dishonest.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I hope someone is able to help.
 I&#x27;m trying to setup Workspace in Outlook for our hybrid environment, but I can&#x27;t get it to work 100%.
 I&#x27;ve tried creating a distribution group, but the distribution group isn&#x27;t showing. These are on prem and not cloud, so what I&#x27;ve done is to create a new in the same OU and provide it same attributes as for one that&#x27;s working - but it&#x27;s not showing.
 Also, when googling around I see pictures showing &quot;Type: Workspaces&quot; which I can&#x27;t see in ours - we don&#x27;t have the Type button.
 I&#x27;m new in this position, so I haven&#x27;t setup this before.
 Thanks and wish you all a great day :-)

                              <span>I really hope this isn&#x27;t considered spam but if so, so be it.
 The goal:
 Preemptively install specific drivers (.inf files) and validate that they were installed by returning a specified exit code. 
 Install method:
 pnputil /add-driver $PSScriptRoot\*.inf /install
 Scratch method to discover:
 Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_PnpSignedDriver 
 What I&#x27;m finding is that pnputil is reporting that it successfully applied the .inf file yet when I look for the driver, it&#x27;s missing. If I can validate the install then I can generate the exit code. This has left me trying to better understand how drivers are handled by windows. Is &quot;applied&quot; installed, stored, or what?

 Steps and usage in the read me
 It&#x27;s not a module yet but thought this could help.

                              <span>Few questions
 What are the other attributes in a live log? Is it radius request from the switch to ise or ISE to switch. I know the result is what ISE is pushing role/DACL? Need little understanding on ISE. 
 When I debug radius logs in switch? Does it show access request and access response logs in debugs. How do we differentiate from access request and access response. 
 Sorry if my questions doesnt make sense.

 Let&#x27;s say that the test coordinators insist you keep running it and switch ports, but you&#x27;ve already burnt through all 10 of them. Even worse, even after an hour it still says the ports are in use, and there is only a scheduled restart at midnight, and your shift is 9 AM.
 Is there a command or something I can run to free up a stuck port? The resources I&#x27;m reading online isn&#x27;t exactly helping, and this is holding me back from a MUCH better assignment. Thanks!

                              <span>I am curious to find out if anyone has any thoughts or experience in implementing micro segmentation for a campus wired network? What I mean is placing all users in a common L2 domain behind one L3 gateway and prevent lateral connections between them? Most controller-based wireless solution would have &#x27;LAN isolation&#x27; feature to enforce this but how would one do this with a bunch of stand-alone access switches? I had a look at private VLAN but that seems to require manual configuration on all switches.

 We currently use HPNA for various things such as config backup and diffs. I want to migrate to Ansible, but was curious if there’s a front-end application that will build playbooks for you based on what you’re trying to achieve. 
 Think drop-down of “run config backup every day at 3 am” or whatever. 
 Does anyone have any experience with something like this?

 Client LAN -----&gt; Client Router -----&gt; Local Loop Telephone Exchange -----&gt; Router @ Carrier Hotel -----&gt; Tier 1 ISP
 Am I missing anything from this high level topology? Where can I learn more about this? Thanks!

                              <span>We are migrating away from ASA to Palo and also disabling our Zscaler proxy service and using Palo as well. Looking to peel off 80/443 from AnyConnect clients and send to Palo so we can disable Zscaler PAC file. Currently have set up ACL for test client, tied to route-map (that points to Palo) and assigned to WAN interface. Testing shows that ACL/route-map is hit and should send to Palo but unable to see anything in pcaps on the ASA or Palo indicating outbound web based traffic is leaving the ASA. Debug shows hits:
 br: policy based route lookup called for 10.5.33.10/63738 to 172.217.168.227/443 proto 6 sub_proto 0 received on interface WAN
 pbr: First matching rule from ACL(21)
 pbr: route map AnyConnect_to_Palo, sequence 10, permit; proceed with policy routing
 pbr: evaluating next-hop 10.5.7.23
 Packet tracer shows its getting dropped on NAT, phase 14, rpf-check, as its not expecting traffic from that subnet on that interface. In theory, it sounds like it should work but Im not seeing where its getting dropped to the Palo. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Ill attach a basic topology too. Thanks.
 Edit: Reason behind design is that the Zscaler service contract is up on 12/31 and looking to not renew for an entire year when we need maybe an extra few weeks in to 2023 to move all end users to GlobalProtect.

                              <span>Hello. My boss wants to use Airplay on the tv. I am going through the logs and I am not sure what is blocking it. I am using avahi to allow mdns for the network. The TV supports Airplay. 
 Android device on network 1 is able to screen share to network 2.
 Apple Device on network 1 is not able to screen share to network 2.
 network 2 is more secured and is not allowed to talk to any of our other networks. I am not sure if it would be using a different port. I am not seeing anything. Going off of Apple&#x27;s site, Airplay uses 80, 443, 554, 3689, and 5353 which I have made a rule for that to be allowed.
 Any direction would be helpful.

                              <span>Hey everyone
 I&#x27;m a fairly new network associate at a huge workplace (~40K employees), and it bugs me beyond belief that not a single decent topology drawing of the company&#x27;s bigass network exists.
 I&#x27;m mingling with the thought of starting the project of mapping the entire infrastructure of the company (it&#x27;s a huge project which will never be complete, I know), but I don&#x27;t think a tool like Visio or Drawio would cut it, since it would become too huge too fast (unless these programs have functionalities that I don&#x27;t know about).
 Is there any tool out there for drawing up massive topologies? I&#x27;m thinking about &#x27;layering&#x27; functions like e.g. a geographical topology where I might open up a location, where I might choose between e.g. physical, L2 or L3 topologies pr. location, etc. A cascading system, if you will, where only the wished for information is displayed at a time.
 Hope the question makes sense!

 Currently zero technical experience but decent theoretical knowledge of protocols, topologies, and all the other foundational theory stuff. 
 I&#x27;ve head of starting from the bottom with a role in Help Desk Services, or of the sort. Currently planning on working towards obtaining a &#x27;CompTIA A+&#x27; certificate, then a CCNA as a next step.
 Any and all advice/suggestions welcome!

                              <span>so im a sys admin at a startup and currently ive been requested to setup a small network for the office
 the network would basically be :
 the modem (supplied by our ISP so its a shitty basic modem) &gt; a firewall (ive never setup one of these ) &gt; a big switch (that we have on a small rack at the office) &gt; 10 tables with 6 user per table (there is a cisco sg300-10 switch on each table) and 4 access points 
 everything besides the modem is Cisco so im guessing there wont be any compatibility issues but ive never setup a network so im unsure of the things ill need (data/info about my network, certificates, etc), best practices, things to look for, tools, test that should be done, general rules, monitoring, security, etc
 so if somebody could help me out and tell me the &quot;procedure/process&quot; you guys personally go trough when setting up an enterprise network or point me in the direction i need to go it would be very appreciated
 my networking experience is limited as before ive only worked in &quot;big&quot; companies and on those ive always had a network engineer or similar taking care of this

                              <span>Hello all,
 ​
 I have a small office and would like to separate my internet into 3 segregated wifi signals for &quot;security&quot; purpose.
 -1 Wifi for Clients
 -1 Wifi for the public
 -1 Wifi for the staff and myself.
 ​
 As it is not possible for me to have cables pulled in the building(cost reason), will 3 wifi help with the security of the internet?
 All my staff PCs have kasperky cloud
 But for the public and client wifi, as I cannot control their devices, I am worried that viruses/trojans infect the Pcs of my staff. Would 3 wifis, help with this issue?
 ​
 Would you know any piece of hardware that could allow me this please?
 The covering radius is about 25 meters.
 ​
 Thanks all!

 Just looking out there what is available as Web Filters for Internet Traffic on Azure Virtual Desktops for a business. At the moment we are using Trend Micro Web Security which works on a Proxy method which seems to work well for us just can be a pain to manage and troubleshoot sometimes. 
 Does anyone have any suggestions on other web filters that we could look into
 Thanks

                              <span>I’ve started my ‘dream job’ and am completely overwhelmed. I have a heavy workload, learning new systems, addressing incident and request tickets, and creating and executing projects with a lot of moving targets and deadlines. 
 I’m still green so this also plays into a frustration with handling items a bit slower than I’d like. I also know that I tend to ‘take on the world’ and feel reluctant to ask for help too soon. It is important that I do my due diligence before leaning into my team as I want to ensure I am carrying my weight. Getting my hands on things is also the best way for me to learn.
 As I’m writing this post I believe I may just need to vent but also ask as to whether this is the norm as a sys eng? Because if so, I truly need to adjust in the way that I handle my work and the way it ties into my mood and stress level.
 What’s y’all experience, strategies, and coping mechanisms?

 From what I remember it was fairly consistent. Is it still a good experience building packages and deploying them?

                              <span>Sorry for the rant in advance... I seem to have an issue with motivating my coworkers. I&#x27;m looking to move up in my department and I am driven to push our department forward but I have coworkers who now routinely expect me to do the vast majority of the work or simply give me the busy work they don&#x27;t want to do. I literally do more tickets than our entire IT department combined... By a longshot. Everyone around me has time to spare to play on their phones and simply refuse to do tickets. If I get training they all get jealous and complain. My coworkers who are the same level as me do almost nothing. It&#x27;s not a lack of experience or knowledge but I see them slacking off all day while I&#x27;m working on overhaul. When they are motivated by the bosses it&#x27;s only fleeting and they quickly go back t…</span>

                              <span>We all used to have password reset requests for users as a farily common occurence, and there is considerable tooling now to automate that/deal with that issue. AADSSPR has been great for us. 
 But now... occupying that same ticket &#x27;slot&#x27; is the MFA reset requests &quot; I broke my phone&quot; &quot;I changed phones&quot; &quot;I uninstalled the app&quot;... is anyone else getting inundated with these now and what tooling or processes do you have in place for them? We have been using app absed number mathcing (had it enabled while in preview) as the &#x27;main&#x27; MFA method. 
 These days with WHfB users aren&#x27;t prompted for notification based MFA often - which I think is making it easier for the app based method to lapse/be forgotten about.

                              <span>Figured I should post this to sort of vent, but also receive advice as I’m currently in charged of a whole IT department for 2 separate locations with about 40 internal/ 100+ clients. I jumped from a systems admin role to IT Manager with only 2.5 years of experience. Even then, I was only handling lower level tickets and worked for an MSP for a year where they literally only had be call Comcast whenever a site went down.. Anyways I feel extremely incompetent as now I’ve been pushed to a director role just 6 months of being here. I just got an intern that I am now training to help me with tasks, but even that requires so much of my time to train on top of dealing with executive meetings and last minute requests from management. 
 Anything related with equipment is basically my responsibility even if I have no idea where it came from or how it got purchased. We have a programs team that is the biggest department in our organization and yet they’re the ones that fail to manage their things and I’m now having to take ownership of their mistakes. I wonder how common this is, and what was your experience as a one man/woman IT. 
 What has helped you with stepping into a leadership role? I’m currently reading the IT Manager Guidebook since that was the only book I’ve found so far, but even so I’m so freaked out at the fact that I don’t know anything and I have so much yet to learn that it’s so overwhelming. Appreciate any advice/resources that has helped you manage a similar situation.
 (btw no disrespect to my intern when I say “1.5” they are just not fully available to assist me. So still it would be a 2 man IT department, don’t want to diminish their contribution )

                              <span>I’m sure I’ll get a bunch of boo hoo’s for this but I’ve been mostly WFH for the past couple years.. typically I’ll go onsite once every other week to rack a server, swap out a failed drive or eject a tape. Typically while onsite I’m the only one in the department apart from a desktop technician.. this week we have someone in from another site so we’re all in the office. It’s only day two and it’s been so exhausting interacting with people all day. I didn’t think it was going to be a big deal but after commuting back and forth from the office and working face to face with people all day, I just want to go hide.

                              <span>Just today we had an issue where one of the terminal servers went offline and we had to reboot it, causing multiple staff to lose their work. Upon rebooting the server everything looked fine, but we were recieving multiple calls asking if something was down, or if it was safe to log in again.
 I was thinking, it would be great if the IT department had a website we could share with users to just have us post a quick &quot;this server went down, but services will be restored soon.&quot; or &quot;Reminder, we are doing maintenance tonight at 10PM&quot; messages that staff could view throughout the day. Mostly just a status and maintenance update kind of site that we can send out when there&#x27;s a known issue and an all clear.
 The purpose would be, of course, if there is something acting up, staff can bring up the page quick and see that there is a problem and what we&#x27;re doing to resolve, so they do not have to call in or wonder and call us to ask.
 I&#x27;m imaging like a live webpage that we can post messages, but have them read only and not allow for replies, new items go to the top and old messages are pushed down over time. Maybe we can mark older issues a resolved and important information like &quot;If you continue to have issues, please try logging off and back in for better performance.&quot;
 Anyway, does that make sense? Is there anything like that we can utilize? I know we can send out emails to staff/groups for updates, but many things do not need to go to all staff, and not all staff need to be aware of issues impacting just certain groups or applications. We were thinking maybe Teams would have something like that, but even so Teams seems a bit underwhelming for that. I&#x27;m thinking just a landing page where we can push out quick updates.

                              <span>Hey! Quick context. The company I work at NEVER deletes anything from AD. From disabled accounts to old computers/servers, they just disable them and let them be (they been doing this for like 10+ years).
 A couple months ago we started a project to clean everything and we still havent found a way to safely delete every disabled user/system (they never do it especially cause they hire a lot of consultants and a lot of them come and go and they just enable/disable their users).
 Pretty cool thing I just discovered (mind I have 0 exp on the area Im literally new on the job) is that you can export/import users. So I thought about exporting them, storage them in any fileserver and delete them from AD. If we ever decide to use them again we just import them with their groups and stuff like they where when we disabled it. Would this work?. 
 Another suggestion we had was to make &quot;parallel OUs&quot; and storage every disabled/thing in the same OU with some kind of designated name like &quot;Logistic Users - Disabled&quot; or something like that. But this would still invovle having EVERY disabled thing still there.
 ​
 What do you guys do to keep AD clean?.
 Is there any tool to keep track of disabled/enabled users? I just use powershell for everything but Im sure theres a more efficient way.

 Received a ticket today from one of our Support team that their account keeps getting locked out. OK, No biggie.
 Check the lockouts and I see that its happening all over the company???
 Major security issue?
 Long Story short: Support Engineer has been mapping drives for users using HIS account. Changed his password last night and has been locking out.
 I was able to get a list of most of the machines that are locking out. I&#x27;ll keep an eye on it to gather more. I spoke with his manager about it and we are going to treat this one as a learning experience.
 **I&#x27;m going to run a script to remove the offending mounts in a few days. No, I&#x27;m not completely evil**

Ideally, I&#x27;d like to purchase a warrantied system with a dedicated PCI port on the mobo, but this is proving to be quite challenging. Is there any solution out there currently? 
 I&#x27;ve priced out a custom build (some business mobos do have legacy PCI still), but I&#x27;d rather have a service contract for the thing and it not be me on the hook. 
 I&#x27;ve thought about a riser/adapter, but I&#x27;d rather go with a dedicated PCI port if I can.

                              <span>Today I had to tell a member of our helpdesk team, who has admin level access to all workstations (MFA protected Windows logins as well) NOT to login, hand a laptop over to another user, and walk away. Apparently he&#x27;s been doing it for weeks because the guy who was doing it before him (at least that guy wasn&#x27;t an admin) hasn&#x27;t been there.So instead of asking us how to get these users logged into a laptop with access to what they needed, he figured why bother? Just log them in as himself and they can access whatever they need.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t even know if this is a rant, question, quiet quitting, or maybe frustration or all of the above.
 ​
 I have been in IT for 20+ years and this is not my first merger and acquisition, so I know it can be done the correct way. The owners of the 3000+ people company I work for bought three small companies (around 60 people total) about a month ago and want to merge those companies into one new company (our company will operate independently) with a new domain, Azure tenant, email, etc. IT was not involved in any of the initial discussions until the deal closed. We were told to drop everything and focus on this project but as other teams complain up the chain, the drop everything and focus on the merger goes out the window.
 ​
 This project needs to get done by December 31st and there&#x27;s no leeway on that time. We talked to some consulting companies and even they say getting it done by end of the year, especially with the US holidays is not possible. We have also been told that if this doesn&#x27;t get done by end of the year, we may all be looking for new jobs. Oh, did I mention that we still do not have any access to the other companies yet to even start any migration, IT from the other companies are dragging their feet with this information.
 ​
 I guess this is where the rant/frustration comes in, but with a message like that from our management and a timeline that does not seem achievable by companies that dedicate their business to mergers (consultants), I don&#x27;t get what chance our small and understaffed team of IT people have at getting this done by end of the year. What&#x27;s the point of doing any work for the remainder of the year... I don&#x27;t know, just frustrated I guess....Open to hearing other people&#x27;s thoughts and opinions.

                              <span>I just discovered Microsoft Powertoys because I got a new monitor (43&quot;) and wanted to set up virtual zones for my applications to really utilize the space how I envisioned it... I am so sad that I never came across this until now! It does a lot of stuff that I have separate apps for like always on top, Awake, color picker, etc... From what I have seen, these are features that sometimes get baked into Windows, as defaults... And it&#x27;s amazing! The PowerToys Run tool is a game changer for me on Windows.... So I hope that I was able to help at least a few people discover this awesome tool to add to their Arsenal! 
 EDIT:
 This has been around for a while and it is &quot;new&quot; to me!

 My users have to initiate a VPN manually. Then they have to do a Quick Assist or LogMeIn session with the helpdesk but when they can&#x27;t get into their laptop they&#x27;re totally stuck. I usually give them the local admin password but even that takes a long time because they type it wrong 20 times. 
 There must be a better way? What do you do?

I am configuring port mirroring on our VMware environment using VCenter - we use distributed switches and the issue I am running into is when a new VM is built it has to manually be added to the port mirror config. Is there a way to automate this in VMWare? Current process - Login to VCenter - Networking - Configure - Port Mirror - edit mirror session - Select Sources - find VM - select VM - Hit OK. - Not sure this is possible within VMWare it self by using templates. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>We host an Avigilon server and periodically, it needs to be restarted due to some AD-related issues. However, whenever it is restarted the internet and all VOIP phones go down for about 3-4 minutes across the entire organization. I have a hunch it may be DNS related, but if the server is left powered off, internet and phones will still restore their connections after a few minutes. This server does not host any DNS/DHCP services and is only running Avigilon server. Any ideas what may be causing this behavior?

                              <span>I think I did a huge mistake..
 I was enrolling computers in Azure AD, and I forgot to copy over the desktop from the local account.
 Now when I choose &quot;Different Account&quot; at the lockscreen it wont allow me to write in the local account. Even tried with &quot;.\localusername&quot;.. So now I just tried to edit on premissions on the local users folder, and toggled on &quot;hidden files&quot;, but I cant find the desktop there..
 Anyone who can help me with this?
 :EDIT:
 It was all just a moment of panic. The user had OneDrive sync, but didnt check off desktop, so when I log on the OneDrive the desktop didnt sync. So that&#x27;s why I kinda paniced. But for some reason there was a file inside the mess in OneDrive that was called desktop. So I managed to recover it from there.

                              <span>Hello guys , have the following settings configured
  
Enabled internet explorer integration policy to IE mode
  
2)Configured sites on the Enterprise list using manager to an xml
 3)Configured using the enterprise mode IE website list policy
 4)Configured also using the configure the enterprise mode site list policy
 ​
 My issue is that IE mode is working fine for administrator users but on normal users if the initial website that i have putted on the xml is changed a bit IE mode goes back to Edge . This is very weird , it works correcly for admins and on non-admin users the initial website is working , but if it changes it does not work , as it goes back to edge

                              <span>I am tasked with verifying on a bunch of unmanaged Win10 computers weather or not certain things are true, for security purposes.
 - Antivirus software Installed / enabled
 - Bitlocker enabled
 - Screensaver set to 15 minutes + Lock workstation
 - Automatic updates enabled
 Is there a script or app that could easily verify all this in 1 go? Powershell? Fairly ignorant about scripting in general. If I had to do more than 50 computers, my first thought would be to hire someone to write a small app that reads the relevant registry settings to then report true or false on each setting.
 Again, these are not company owned machines and have no Active Directory or anything of the sort. Continual monitoring of weather these settings stay as they are in the future is not currently required.
 There may be appetite for a similar script for Mac users, but ... 1 thing at at time.
 I suppose I could aim for a slightly higher level of sophistication, where the app would capture some fingerprints like the date, computer name, and Mac address etc to keep as evidence of compliance.

                              <span>Hi there, 
 We have a web proxy running for web filtering and it uses the user&#x27;s credentials to authenticate via the Web Filter. But for this to happen the session has to do a HTTP request on a web browser that is using the proxy.
 We use MS Edge as the default browser. 
 Does anyone know of a way that I can automatically do a HTTP request when the user logs in via MS Edge so when they open the browser the session will already be authenticated?
 Problem we have is most sites these days are HTTPS, and for the web filter to authenticate it must be a http site. 
 Any workaround anyone has would be great to hear of.
 Thanks

 Has someone encountered similar issues or does this indicate a misconfiguration?

                              <span>Hi All
 I have been asked to look again into delaying all emails by 2 mins, so that any errors can be rectified by dragging the item back out of the outbox. 
 I see that this can be easily done per user via a simple Outlook rule in the rules wizard. But can this be acheived across the firm somehow? Maybe something implemented in a transport policy in Exchange Online?
 I am hoping someone has implemented this before and has it working , so they can tell me what they are using and how it was implemented. 
 Many thanks in advance.

                              <span>New sysadmin here,
 My current job is making a redundant NPS server to login to the WIFI.
 The current NPS server also functions as the root CA that enables trust for the clients. Because of a problem with our network, we are unable to chain this CA to a publicly trusted CA. Meaning users need to accept our CA as trusted when first logging into our network.
 My boss said that I should make the new server a root CA as well. However, this would mean devices would also need to accept this new CA as trusted. This could cause confusion amongst users, why I am not keen on the solution.
 My idea is as follows:
  
Copy all NPS settings to the new server.
 Make this new server a subordinate CA, chaining it to the already existing root CA.
  
I have two questions regarding this setup:
  
Will this make it so devices only need to accept a certificate once?
 What happens when the existing (root CA) is down, will the trust in the subordinate CA keep persisting?
  
I am still a bit of a noob when it comes to NPS and certificates, so any help would be appreciated!

 Do you have any experience integrating Splunk with Shuffle and Thehive? I got no idea where to start and don&#x27;t have the picture painted in my mind so any architectural/networking information would be highly appreciated!
 Do you think it&#x27;s a good combination? Any tips or recommendations are welcome.
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>Starting from an LVM VG made by 1 PV that is a MDADM RAID5 array of 4 drives, which is the best way to extend the VG?
 We are replacing the 4 drives with bigger ones and we are wondering which is better to do:
  
Extend the mdadm raid5 partitions on the disk (in order to occupy the free space of each new disk) and then grow, in order: mdadm RAID5 -&gt; PV -&gt; VG.
 Create 4 new partitions on the unused space of the new disks, create a new raid5 array from them, add the new mdamd array as PV and extend the VG.
  
Thanks in advance

                              <span>I&#x27;m running out of ideas and I&#x27;m hoping some other experienced IT people can help me out. I look after a small office with 8x Dell Optiplex 3070&#x27;s in micro form factor and they intermittently and randomly will not post when the staff arrive in the morning to turn them on. There is a post error code on the power button that is amber 2 blinks on, 1 off, 1 on (video below). 
 In talking to Dell and scouring reddit/the internet internet indicates motherboard or system failure. They are on warranty for another month from Dell, and we&#x27;ve replaced the motherboards in a couple systems and the problem persists so I think it is something else. They are all stock with the exception of replacing the spinning drives they shipped with with Samsung 860 EVO&#x27;s. 
 If you unplug the power to them for a minut…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m transitioning into IT at 35 after working in education the last 10 years. I consider myself reasonably intelligent and have been working rather successfully towards industry certifications. Now, as many of you rightly point out, certifications don&#x27;t equal experience. All they serve to do is fill gaps in my theory, such as being unaware of how networking works until studying OSI model, TCP, etc.
 So the question then becomes, how do I learn how to do things right? Many folks on here talk about homelabbing, and I&#x27;m slowly but surely spinning up things with Azure credits and Raspberri Pis, but at the end of the day, all of my work relies on internet research. If some yahoo on StackOverflow says to set it up one way or another, there&#x27;s little I can do to verify that this is a conceptually sound process, because I lack the experience - I don&#x27;t know what I don&#x27;t know.
 Of course, many people would next say &#x27;get the experience.&#x27; But how can one do that if one does not have the experience to get the job in the first place? That is to say, my goal is working my way into systems administration. In such a job they might want me to produce an effective backup storage solution, but if my knowledge comes from tainted sources, how can I do this? It seems like so, so many organizations are running with these barebones IT teams where there&#x27;s really limited opportunity to start as a junior admin and learn under them over time.

                              <span>Hello, 
 I have a client who has 2 machines with an underlying Windows XP OS. Users in the Office put files in the machines through network share. 
 Found out the connection they use is SMBv1, which is a security risk.
 I have been tasked to find a solution for it.
 First of all they can upgrade their system to the latest OS but its going to cost them a lot, which they&#x27;d like to avoid. They also like to avoid using USB Sticks and keep walking from the Office to the machines.
 I thought of using a NAS(Network Attached Storage) but I don&#x27;t think this is going to work because the NAS needs to place files in the machine, which I have no clue how to do that, or is this even possible.
 Second, the machines don&#x27;t need access to the internet at all. I preferably like to isolate the machines from the internal network, which can be done with a NAS.
 Finally, disable access to the internet on the machines and leave it as it is, which is not secure.
 Any idea&#x27;s how to solve this?

 For a certain software we use, a specific Windows user must be created first. Right now we create the uset using PowerShell. But to ensure the installation works, we have to signout and signin to the newly created user at least one to run the OOBE?.
 Is there a way to run this stuff which is shown at first login from the command line?

                              <span>I am currently a green networking admin, and wanting to build more security in our environment by creating a native vlan as we currently run everything on vlan1. I want to ensure that my thoughts on this are correct prior to moving forward as we dont have a test environment, but have many many switches/routers in environment.
 Is it as easy and creating a new vlan 199 naming it native on each router/swtich/nexus and then inputting the command:
 switchport trunk native vlan 199. Or is there something else that needs to be done that I am missing?

                              <span>Hi, currently we have 2 ASA&#x27;s in a HA pair for our Web hosting firewalls, these firewalls directly portchannel into our border leaf ACI environment where the servers live.
 The issue is that for our outgoing Internet traffic on our other pair of ASA&#x27;s, I&#x27;m going to use PBR to divert traffic to our new outgoing Palos to avoid a big bang, but for our new web hosting Palos, I can&#x27;t use PBR because the border leafs go directly into the current web hosting ASA firewalls. So there is no way for me to re-route traffic to reach the new solution.
 All of the clients/servers on the webhosting side have their gateways pointed to the current interfaces on our web hosting ASA&#x27;s (not on a BD in ACI). So these gateways would need to point to the new solution to. The new solution will have the same interfaces, ip&#x27;s in the same networks etc... but will be different ip&#x27;s. 
 I need to find a way to avoid a big bang approach of just flicking over the all the servers gateways to the new firewalls with the migrated rule sets on and hoping for the best. I&#x27;d much rather try and find a way to control traffic, like I am doing with PBR on our outgoing solution.
 Hopefully I&#x27;ve explained it clearly enough.
 Thanks everyone

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m in the middle of a firewall migration from ASA to Palos and have run into a couple of issues (I&#x27;ll make another post if people want to check that out to as its a seperate issue). 
 For this one, we have 2 firewalls in a HA pair for our outgoing Internet traffic, we have public addresses free so I can use them on our new solution instead of being limited to the one on the current solution.
 Essentially I&#x27;m going to put a new public ipv4 address on our new solution as the physical IP, all is good expect for the issue that some of our servers use services on the Internet and these services expect the NAT&#x27;d traffic to come from our current public IP, we can&#x27;t afford next to any downtime because of the business we are and we want to avoid a &quot;big bang&quot; approach to this to. Does anyone have any ideas how I can get around this?
 At the moment my only one is to get the services on the Internet to whitelist our entire range instead of just the physical public interface ip at the moment?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi, our current Guest WiFi system is basically an open SSID that leads to a Meraki splash page where you enter your mobile number as a form of ID and gain access to the network.
 I&#x27;ve been looking at different ways to improve on this. My first thought was to use the same ID method but with a WPA3 PSK so the average Joe on the street couldn&#x27;t just connect to. But this wouldn&#x27;t stop someone from leaking the key I suppose in the end.
 So after that I&#x27;ve now thought about an approval process where possibly our 1st line helpdesk could approve access after a user enters their details in with a reason for being onsite etc...
 Has anyone implemented a process like this before. We have a Meraki AP architecture and ISE as our radius server. I was thinking/hoping that there could be a guest splash page that could link into ISE and for ISE to do some cool stuff behind the scenes with approvals.
 Thanks

                              <span>We are currently set up as a &quot;flat&quot; network... Layer 2 is everywhere segmented by VLANs but unfortunately, we use VLAN1 for a lot of things. We are setting up a separate location using Comcast P2P. All the things at this location would need to talk to servers on a mix of VLANS. Eventually, we want to route everything but one of my questions is does it have to be done all at once? Our initial thought is to start with this location and then move on to everything else. 
 Doing some research, I believe the most future-proof routing protocol would be OSPFv2 (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong). Is it going to be a huge headache to connect a 10.0.0.0 to a 192.168.0.0 network? Currently, everything is on 192.168. The biggest reason we want to move to layer 3 is that we have a data center connected to the main location via 2 dark fibers and 1 P2P fiber. Currently, they are separated from each other and the P2P is on a disabled port only to be enabled when the other 2 are down. The 2 dark fibers are redundant but we want to connect that 3rd one to the other 2 dark fibers. We either can&#x27;t do that or can&#x27;t figure out how to do that because the 2 dark fibers are 10g and the P2P is 1g.
 Is it feasible to move to layer 3? We have roughly 350 PCs, 100 printers, ~400 phones, 35 switches, and ~100 servers and I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;m missing more. We are a small team of 4 that does it all, Only 2 of us do the networking I would not call us experts by any means but we make it work. Any problems I didn&#x27;t think of please let me know.

                              <span>I&#x27;m working with a hotel, between 100- 150 rooms. Each room might have 2-3 devices going at the same time, so I&#x27;m looking at potentially as many as 400 devices that need wifi, maybe even more at peak.
  
 Almost every hotel has absolutely crummy internet, and I&#x27;m trying to avoid that.
 What are your recommendations for routers and router setups to accommodate this many devices?
 This is pretty key. Is there a way to set it up where the available bandwidth is divided up by password? For example I give someone a code they can use to sign into with as many devices as they like, but the total bandwidth allotted to that password would be something like 1MBps?
 Unfortunately the internet service is Frontier, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s optional.
  
Thank you in advance for any advice, I&#x27;m fairly tech savvy but networking is out of my wheelhouse.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to configure route-tag on our Nexus 7K&#x27;s to nip some routing loops in the bud where we do mutual re-distribution between OSPF and BGP. I have the following configured.
 route-map multipod-bgp&gt;ospf deny 10 match tag 100 route-map multipod-bgp&gt;ospf permit 20 set tag 200 ! route-map multipod-ospf&gt;bgp deny 10 match tag 200 route-map multipod-ospf&gt;bgp permit 20 set tag 100 ! router ospf 1 vrf overlay-1 router-id 10.30.19.12 redistribute bgp 65500 route-map multipod-bgp&gt;ospf log-adjacency-changes ! router bgp 65500 vrf overlay-1 address-family ipv4 unicast redistribute direct route-map multipod-route-map redistribute ospf 1 route-map multipod-ospf&gt;bgp 
 Now I do this for EIGRP/BGP as well, and on EIGRP L3 interfaces I also apply tags using an inbound distribute-list with the same route-map with the following syntax:
  ip distribute-list eigrp vrf-A route-map eigrp&gt;bgp in 
 Now the question is how do I configure this same thing for an OSPF L3 interface? The commands are not the same as eigrp and don&#x27;t really seem to have an analog and I can&#x27;t seem to figure out how to apply a distribute-list to an OSPF L3 interface.

                              <span>Right now I have (2) SG300-28P and (1) SG-300-52. Total 108 ports, not all in use. These are close to 10 years old and rock solid, never failed but it&#x27;s time.
 Don&#x27;t need POE, we have some POE switches as we had some Cisco Phones. Did away with those.
 Don&#x27;t need managed or stackable. We are not managing these switches at all. It&#x27;s a small shop BUT I will probably get managed anyway if they offer better performance?
 So I am looking at getting two 48 port Non-POE GE Cisco switches.
 So I am comparing the CBS220 vs CBS250 vs CBS350 series. What is the main difference between these, anybody? TIA.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 since starting networking, I was looking for a tool to create a interactive network diagram.
 Basically the &quot;main goal&quot; is, to have a interactive world map with all network locations and datacenter (including the connections to each other). What I mean by interactive is, that you can hover over a country or location and see the most important information as well as being able to &quot;drill down&quot; by double clicking it.
 I know it is a lot, but and I tried several solutions over the years and found not a single one to create such a &quot;diagram&quot;
 - Visio - Great for detailed Branch Network documentations, but not intereactive
 - Miro - Interactive and easy to use for &quot;quick and dirty&quot; schematics
 - draw.io - same as Miro
 - powerpoint - Interactive but not really meant for network diagrams
 - lucidcharts - same as visio
 - NetBrain - expensive, kinda hard to master and not &quot;easy to use&quot;
 - Any other SDN tool (solarwinds, n-map, ...) same as netbrain
 - even tried some tools for scientific network maps - They basically do what I need but just to a certain degree
 - .....
 As you might notice I&#x27;ve tried a lot and might even have missed some things i tested in the past.
 Maybe one of you big brains out there has something in mind or created something similar in the past.
 I am looking forward for any tips, hints and suggestions :)

                              <span>What are the reasons to replace/upgrade an ONT? Is it just to deliver faster speeds? Can an ISP install a 10G ONT and limit the port speed to whatever the subscriber is paying for 1G, 2.5G etc. That way the subscriber would have an ONT that’s future proof should the subscriber choose to upgrade to faster speeds?
 Is there any other reason to replace/upgrade an ONT other than a failure or physical speed limit of the ethernet port?
 How long does an ONT typical last?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I hope this is the right place to post this,
 I&#x27;m looking for a 1U switch for a datacenter rack with the following requirements.
  
2 x SFP+ or faster fibre for link to meet-me-room
 24 x 1G RJ45
 Managed L2 switch
 Redundant power supply
 Doesn&#x27;t block with various frame sizes at 60%+ saturation
 Budget max ~2k Euro
 Max 200W power usage (No PoE needed)
  
I have looked into Mikrotik CRS354-48G-4S+2Q+RM, but from the Servethehome performance review mentioned one should buy a different switch if used at higher saturation. Also some comments about Ubiquiti USW-EnterpriseXG-24 and FS S5850-24XMG, though these are 10G L3 switches, so much more than required for my use case. So should be OK?
 Any model or brand you would recommend instead? I saw HP Aruba instant on, but they don&#x27;t have a redundant PSU except for the CX line. Arista or Brocade?
 Thanks,Matt

                              <span>Hello! 
 All my life i tried to mantain my network, cables and devices all working under the same pattern (usually 568A) and only when needed to,use a crossover cable. In my current adventure, i have little resources and a doubt.
 I have in my hands:
 A rack filled with T568B &quot;Male&quot; Rj-45 cat5e cables.
 A nice furukawa patch-panel.
 Tons of T568A cat5e patch cords of the size i need.
 My doubt: If i crimp the male cables INTO the (female) patch panel at the same pattern as the other end, that is, T568B, then connect the patch cable to my switch through the T568A patch cord... Would i be limiting the internet to 100mb or would it still distribute GBe? Would it even work properly?
 If that wouldn&#x27;t work... Any suggestions on working it around? would crimping the cables into the patch panel as T568A - same as patch cord - even though the other end is 568B, be better?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I have a network that is getting bogged down and I believe it is due to 1 device sending lots of ARP requests. It sends them every other packet for the IP of the device it is currently in session with. It is some type of industrial switch/control. I am new to modbus/TCP and is this normal? It is doing it nonstop all day. I do not have access to the network, only the pcap files from a few hosts on the network.

 Smaller the better. Needs to have one physical port at least. Even better I&#x27;d it had an on board serial too.

 The Juniper documentation says that it will be configured using a instance-type virtual-switch, but then I can&#x27;t find any configuration examples of this. I just want traffic coming over the PW to be sent out a single AC which will be performing a swap on the outer VLAN tag.

 Just a quick summary of our environment: We have 2 buildings that need to be connected together. The main building and the remote location which is a few miles away. These 2 locations are currently connected via CISCO ASA&#x27;s.
 Here is a network diagram of how things are connected: https://freeimage.host/i/capture.HfdMblR
 We have IP Phones which are configured to be on VLAN 2, and they also get their own separate DHCP Addresses from the CISCO ASA&#x27;s. These IP phones also act as a passthrough to provi…</span>

                              <span>Thought experiment: what would happen if you made your LAN gateway 169.254.0.1 and you subnet mask 255.255.0.0 (or smaller)? What would be the pros and cons? Would such a LAN even need a DHCP server (for Windows devices)? Definitely not going to implement into an prod env, but just wondering if anyone else has had similar thoughts.

                              <span>Hello, Is there any chance to get a mounting bracket which would level up the switch with the front railings? Normally there is about an inch of a gap where the switch is popping out.

 could you help me?
 What ISP is or was owner of IP address 86.49.187.186.
 One source shows the ISP is Starnet (czech ISP) and other source shows the ISP is Vodafone? What is right?
 For example - https://cs.ipshu.com/ipv4/86.49.187.186 there is &quot;starnet&quot; and down on the same page is Vodafone.
 Or can I check if the Starnet use / used infrastructure of Vodafone?
 Thanks

                              <span>So I’m putting together a new UniFi network (I know, it’s not mission critical so that should be fine) for an organization thats around medium size.
 The idea is to put a Dream Machine at the top of the network, connected directly to a UniFi aggregate switch, and then connect that to the rest of the switches in the network.
 The plan is to have two 48 port switches in the same rack as the the aggregate switch and dream machine. The question is, does it make more sense to connect each 48 port in the same “stack” directly to the aggregate switch, or would it be better to daisy chain the two switches. Or does it not matter at all.
 Not really too important but couldn’t find much advice about this online and wanted to try to keep things clean and easy. Thanks for your help!

 I am trying to recreate this paper courtesy of the user that linked his website a while ago. I am just curious how I might go about capturing SNMP queries of an EVE-NG topology in a program. Does EVE-NG offer an API? Can this perhaps be accomplished using HTTP similar to this video? Like the paper, my goal is to model the topology in GraphQL using the LSDB’s of the routers in my topology. Thanks in advance for any guidance.

 I had seen to add Powershell &quot;script&quot; (one line) to disable then enable again the security via NetJoinLegacyAccountReuse registry key. But I am fairly novice at MDT. We are just using a completely &quot;plain&quot; Task Sequence for deployment with no customisation really. Where do I put the disable security step please?

 We got SNMP working no problem, but we rather avoid that. When the SNMP traffic comes across our diode all the traffic appears to come from it. We would need to modify communication strings to know what came from where which is a no go. We already use WUG, but they only offer bi-directional TCP connections between two servers. 
 For something to work we would need a server on the inside to pass across the diode to the outside with one-way TCP communication or UDP.

                              <span>I’ve been a 1-person IT department for a small rural school district for the past decade. My title is “IT Director” but that seems little grandiose for what I do. But I do it all… inventory, imaging, network, budgeting/purchasing, monitoring, security, planning, pulling cable, cameras, repairs, Google admin, A/V, backups… The only thing I don’t do is copier repair. 
 I’m planning on moving back to an urban/suburban area soon and I’d like to be a part of a larger IT dept but I don’t know what kind of a role to look for. I have major imposter syndrome and can’t figure out if I’m over or under valuing my abilities. It also seems like a lot has changed in the past decade. Hell, when I started my current position, the building didn’t have full WiFi coverage and most teachers still used overhead projectors with markers. Now every student has a laptop. Ideally, I’d like to stay in education but just something where there’s more than just me and my thoughts all day working together. 
 I’m just wondering if anyone else has made a similar move and what your experience was like. 
 Also, is the “director” title a liability on a resume?

                              <span>Hey all, I have come across some weird RDP issues when attempting to RDP from my windows 11 machine to Server 2022. When attempting to RDP to the server, I get a response that &quot;Your credentials did not work&quot;. I have tried both my username and the Administrator as well. Both give me the same response. If I RDP into a different machine, then RDP into the server I am able to access it with no issues using either my credentials or the Administrator credentials. 
 Has anybody come across something like this? I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out why this is happening.

 certbot certonly -d domain.com -d *.domain.com --manual --preferred-challenges dns-01 --preferred-chain &quot;ISRG Root X1&quot;
 But when I use this command, &quot;openssl verify&quot; cannot confirm the validity of the cert, even though certbot reads the sub-domain TXT records, and issues cert contents that it reports is valid:
 certbot certonly -d sub.domain.com -d *.sub.domain.com --manual --preferred-challenges dns-01 --preferred-chain &quot;ISRG Root X1&quot;
 What the hell am I doing wrong? And no, I&#x27;m not interested in changing my workflow, certbot is not-optional to switch away from at this time, and yes I need to do TXT manual entries for reasons I do not want to go into.
 If I could please get help pointing out why this somehow doesn&#x27;t work, because it should... the error outputted when failing is:
 CN &#x3D; sub.domain.com error 20 at 0 depth lookup: unable to get local issuer certificate error fullchain.pem: verification failed
 (it says the same thing with cert.pem)
 Naturally I have obfuscated the domain for public safety.
 Any help is appreciated! Thanks! :D

                              <span>At my work all the computer users have standard accounts, and I have ADMIN accounts on all the computers. 
 We have a few ESSENTIAL pieces of software (MelcoUI, RDWorks - to name a few) that trigger a UAC prompt just to launch the application. Obviously I don&#x27;t want to give the admin passwords to users just so they can use the software that they need to do their jobs - that negates the whole point of giving them least privileges. And obviously I dont want employees using admin profiles either due to security concerns. 
 My question is: Is there way to disable UAC for these pieces of software so they can launch them from a standard user profile without having to input an admin password?
 Any suggestions on how to go about this?

                              <span>I have a custom Database frontend that appears to be hardcoded to the SQL server&#x27;s IP address. I tested this by modifying my host file for the SQL servers hostname to point to 127.0.0.2 and I could still log into the frontend of the app and pull up data. Next I set the Windows Firewall to block all outgoing connection to the SQL servers IP address and I couldn&#x27;t log into the app.
 I want to migrate the backend database to a modern SQL server (and test the frontend client to ensure it still works) but other than installing a second vNIC on the new SQL server with the old servers IP address (which is an option), is there a way to modify the frontend?
 I&#x27;m not a programmer. I think it was created in Studio for NET 2004. 
 Edit: I just opened a login.vb file and found a reference to the server&#x27;s IP address. If I change it...how do I...compile the application? Seriously I know nothing. Ideally this would point to a server name so I can create a DNS entry.
 Thanks

 First a bit of backstory: I long suspected that the AP department was just a bunch of busybody hacks since they always found some other reason for their work not getting done, especially once they had several people on a Monday complain that they were at a complete work stop because of a change we did over the weekend... Only thing was that we cancelled the change over the weekend and literally nothing was done to their systems in the intervening 64 hours since they last touched them. We had to spend all day with the VP level people confirming that yes; literally noth…</span>

 I found a registy/GPO that will disable the Windows Welcome Experience but, not sure if that will do it. Testing this now
 Can anyone confirm if by switching off the Windows Welcome Experience registry will it stop the Windows Hello pop ups? If not, what GPO/Registry would disable the pop up?

 I found an old reddit post that shows the notification pop up I am seeing. Unfortunately, no answer in there.

 So, after waiting the weekend to cool down, I sent them a reply today. I gave them, and everyone CC’d on the email, a rundown of how many emails and websites our company visits per day and how many of those are malicious and blocked by our software. I also included a list of their not-blocked, personal websites, that are visited from a work computer, which is a clear violation of the terms in our handbook. I also told her that there has never been a time we didn’t unblock a work related website …</span>

I&#x27;m slowly moving business processes to PowerApps/Sharepoint but before I had a chance to finish the user certificates expired and now the users can&#x27;t use it at all. 
 I&#x27;ve found many articles on how to extend user certificates but from what I understand, the Certifier ID also expired (the one that issues the certificates) and I can&#x27;t find any info on how to solve that.
 Mind you, I&#x27;m a noob to Lotus Notes - any idea where I can get help?

                              <span>I&#x27;m the &quot;tech-guy&quot; for a small startup. We use Microsoft 365 for all our email needs. We average about 15 outgoing emails a day and about 60 inward. We&#x27;re small, we don&#x27;t send bulk email, it&#x27;s just not appropriate for our customer base. We had SPF configured, and that was working well (i.e. we didn&#x27;t notice it not-working).
 Last week we started getting &quot;550 5.7.1&quot; errors from any emails sent to a google hosted domain.
 I&#x27;m going through the advice on Google&#x27;s support pages and it&#x27;s all targeted at bulk-senders and so on. We have a 100% &quot;Bad&quot; reputation for our IPs (from November 2) and a &quot;Bad&quot; reputation for the Domain since August. I suspect this is due to some entries in our SPF entry which includes a slightly dodgy hosting company. We use an external ERM tool which is hosted there and I added their IP ranges to the SPF. Since then the email config has changed and it&#x27;s not required to add their IPs to my SPF.
 On Friday I removed all the SPF records bar the microsoft one and I set up DKIM and DMARC.
 I&#x27;m getting green lights on all the DMARC dashboards for our DNS setup. I can see email headers are containing all the good stuff and I am receiving reports from recipient servers with confirmation that my DMARC is good.
 But, we&#x27;re still not able to send to any google hosted domains. What further steps can I take to heal my domain&#x27;s reputation, and how can I get some more warning on this in future?

                              <span>In a situation where I have 90 printers to be installed on network clients, some of these are installed correctly (those via the network), while others are shared by other PCs.
 Of these, I should change the description, in this case switch from TCP/ip port to Local port.
 Through windows I can click on &quot;add port&quot;, and assign it manually. My problem, however, is being able to do it through a special script that changes this option for me.
 I investigated through Prnmngr, Prnport, cscript. But I can&#x27;t find a way to automate this field switch.
 Powershell for internal policy is not possible to do this.
 Thank you.

                              <span>hi guys, i&#x27;ve an old Fas2220 with my VM stored in there (vmware esxi, vCenter etc) and now its really old that i can&#x27;t monitoring anymore because i can&#x27;t update the interface of netapp because everything its outdate, i would like to migrate a new dual controller storage (i see only uc3200 from the newest technology from synology but its a bit expensive for my purpose) 
 so i&#x27;ve 2 problems
 1st is migrate all the VM(including the pfSense..) (and all possible newtork configuration) to a new dual controller storage, better a Synology because i&#x27;ve already another Synology only for backup with &#x27;Active backup for business&#x27; but its just for safe, the VMs Run on the this old Netapp)
 2nd Chose a new one, UC3200 is great but expensive, maybe an little oldest one?

 I would like to change the password complexity and length of validity.
 For example, if I change the minimum characters from 8 to 10, will 500 users have to enter a new password at the same time, or only when the old password expires?
 I would like to change the minimum length from 8 to 10 and the validity from 6 months to 2 years.
 But without 500 tickets at once from people who don&#x27;t understand the new policy.

                              <span>First time poster here, I think this post follows the rules but sorry if I missed something.
 Admin at a small private school, 2 campuses each with about 300 students.
 We&#x27;ve got a Ubiquiti UDM-Pro on each campus, but it seems like we&#x27;re operating at capacity.
 Ubiquiti recommends up to 40 devices (network devices, not clients) on each UDM pro, and we&#x27;ve got 45 on each.
 This seems to put a strain on the UDM-pros, since the CPU is always operating at 90-100% and the GUI-based portion of the OS frequently crashes, and we have to restart the unifi services via SSH in order to get back in.
 Anyone have any recommendations on how to go about replacing the UDM-pros with something that can handle the load better, and have that recommended 20% headroom?

                              <span>So using Linux on the desktop is not an option. Our desktop teams have done POCs with various distros but at our scale, they find it is near impossible to manage efficiently (too many one-offs, surprises with hardware in new laptops, and so on)
 Macs are an option but not everyone is familiar with OSx or wants one.
 So I&#x27;m going to make a case for Windows Subsystem for Linux probably with Ubuntu. Looks like it is just another app as far as Windows is concerned and can be managed as such. I&#x27;m curious if there are any gotchas, security concerns, or things like that I&#x27;m over looking.

                              <span>I started a job last month at a local college as an IT-consultant, and my main role so far has been resolving support tickets and rigging classrooms for online lectures, zoom meetings, among other stuff. There is, however, a recurring problem amongst the teaching staff, where they for some reason can&#x27;t for the life of them understand why they would have to turn on projectors, or press Windows+P to get the projected display to cooperate...
 So my question here is:
 Do any of you guys have any smart solutions for automating these kinds of minor annoyances? I have tried making some flows in PowerAutomate at home, just to get to know more about this type of thing, and I&#x27;m also well versed in Python.
 Any and all suggestions are welcome :)

 I have a problem with the remote access to a terminal server.
 I gave the remote-permission on our TS to a user from our domain like I did with the last for users (where the connection works). But it does not work with one specific user. This user has the same rights and is linked with the same GPOs as the other four.
 When I connect with the TS I get the error that the user has no permission for a remote-login... Has anyone an idea what the problem could be?

One of those users needed some help and for some reason the admin password for that device was expired, which basically never happened with any of the other devices before.
 Does anyone have an idea what could have caused this? It seems crazy that for one guy it happens but not for the other 10-20 people.

                              <span>Hi there,
 we&#x27;re having a standard setup:
  
syncing AD with AAD Connect to the cloud
 Exchange Hybrid with Exchange 2016
  
We&#x27;re having a subset of users, who are external suppliers and have their external SMTP adresses added to their AD account, as an Exchange contact object; they don&#x27;t have a mailbox.
 Background for this is, that we have Apps like Jira and Confluence, where those suppliers should receive updates for Tickes/Sites on their primary work address. Those apps source the SMTP Adress from the AD mail property. I really don&#x27;t like this setup, but that&#x27;s something grown.
 However, this is making some trouble with syncing to the cloud, since those SMTP adresses are already registerd with the tenant of the supplier, which makes absolutely sense. But we need those accounts synced to AAD, because we&#x27;re using AAD as Identity Provider (IdP) for several apps.
 Qeustion to the community?
 How have you solved a challenge like this?
 From my point (Exchage/AD) I can only imagine a solution with Exchange mailboxes for those users with a forwarding to their primary work address. But thils will cost a license in the future, when we move those mailboxes to Exchange Online. That&#x27;s something I want to avoid.
 My preferred solution would be, that such users can set a notification address in the application. But I don&#x27;t know if this possible.
 Thanks for helping!

Not only because of the culture but because i didn&#x27;t want to be next when i have a mortgage to pay for.
 Back then we were a team of 3, Me: Sys Admin. Colleague: Senior Sys Admin and my boss: IT Manager. We all worked well together and it was a powerhouse. My boss pretty much designed their ERP system from scratch whilst me and the other sysadmin just powered through server upgrades, network upgrades, computer rollouts and help-desk stuff shared between us.

 If yes, what software do you use to send out the emails? I am currently on the lookout for a fitting software, but there is a lot to choose from and the companies selling the software all put the exact same marketing stuff on their sales website, without any screenshots, feature lists or videos of the program.
 So. What do you use, why and does it work good for you? Any issues while using it? Anything I would need to know before buying the software?

                              <span>Hep guys,
 I am looking for a solution to have 2 sites connected 24/7 via voice communication. It means to say that there is no need for dialing and the users could just speak over the system and the other site would be able to hear it. I have 2 sites that needs this real time communication system for ease of operations.
 Do you know what’s out there that can do this?
 I looked at those IP phones but I am assuming that dialing and picking up is needed.
 Edited: I do have VPN connected between these two sites so I am assuming the only thing we need to figure out is the system that allows this to work.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 We use Android tablets for our WMS in a warehouse-like place. This place has some kind of 1st floor made with a steel structure on top of the ground floor (a lovely location to play with Wifi).
 Tablets have always had issues with Wifi connection dropping.
 In order to improve the situation, we&#x27;ve added somes more APs, changed channels. It did help a bit but issues haven&#x27;t disappeared.
 Recently, we tested some new tablets (for other reasons), and these one&#x27;s had less issues when roaming.
 After some more research i&#x27;ve heard about Rate settings and decided to give it a shot and made a great mistake : pushing the changes to prod before even testing...
 The major changes were made by our service provider after i asked what they thought of it.
 After a ton of user complaints (tablets were almost always dis/re-connecting), i rolled back to the previous rates settings (had screenshot of it). Even though situation has improved, it is still worse than before the changes.
 I&#x27;ve switched back to 2.4GHz only the APs on the warehouse side, rates are the same as before.
 All tablets models are impacted : CrossCall T4 (Android 10), Samsung A8 and S6 lite (Android 12), our APs are exclusively Aerohive ap130.
 Now my back is against the wall as i don&#x27;t see what could be causing this... 
 Any help is welcome

                              <span>From a corp FW perspective, do you see reason NOT to explicitly allow all of 443/udp outbound, generally speaking?
 I&#x27;m learning about QUIC because it is apparently used as part of M365 for some of the OneDrive/SP stuff, and I created a rule to allow it as per MSFT&#x27;s docs, however the more I read the more I realize lots of things use it, and it&#x27;s pretty secure.
 I feel like I could create a better user experience in general for Google/MSFT/Anything in the future that uses QUIC, by allowing UDP/443 outbound indiscriminately, but of course from a gut-feeling perspective, it feels inappropriate to do so.
 What have some of you done? Are you specifying destination criteria / keeping up with new domains/CIDRs for this or are you allowing it outbound to anything?

 If you ctrl+f this blog for &quot;Deflecting Reflection&quot; it appears you could be DoS&#x27;ed, perhaps something to consider.

                              <span>Hoping someone can get me an answer to this quicker than Cisco. I have a Cisco 4331 that lost power and now will not communicate with the smart server. I have fixed that issue by updating the interface and the router shows that the smart licensing is enabled and registered. However when I do a &quot;sh lic all&quot; under &quot;license usage&quot; there are now no licenses showing when I should have 3. Do I need a tac case for cisco to apply the 3 license I need (security k9 and app-k9) or is there a command I can enter to get these registered on my own?
 If I do a sho ver I show it does have Foudationsuitek9, securityk9

 I’m wondering if anyone is able to point me in the direction of a good video course/ instructor, or material for the ENWLSI 300-430? 
 I’ve seen people make mention that the book isn’t in alignment with the exam. I’m going to be taking over the wireless side of our team, so I figured I may as well get a CCNP wireless. 
 Thank you!

 Lately, after we proved our ability to design, implement and deliver complete and complex solutions, and we booted some of our competitors who couldn&#x27;t, we started getting noticed by various vendors who wanted to partner up with us, which is great.
 One of those is Allied Telesis - They have a minuscule, and I do mean EXTREMELY tiny presence in our country as they have only entered our market, but the downside of that is that I have no idea how good or bad their products are, and I&#x27;m not going to suggest a product to my client without knowing that it&#x27;s good and reliable, regardless of how cheap it may be.
 So my question to you is, oh great RNHM , have you any experience with Allied Telesis, and would you recommend them for Access/Edge or Core/Aggregation, Both?

                              <span>Example Network Topology
 Please see my network topology sketch. How would you join Special System A and Special System B with a common Layer 2 domain? I have a routed network, but these devices must have transparent layer 2 connectivity between them?
 If I have a Cisco 3850, Cisco 9300, and a Cisco 3650 in a triangle of routing, can I use a technology, such as VXLAN to span a VLAN across these? Do these platforms support this?
 What if I have a more complex network? Does each switch in the routing path need to be VXLAN supporting, or only the ingress/egress switches?
 Is there a performance consideration doing this, or should the switches be able to handle this traffic at or near line-speed?
 Is there a better way? I have no experience on VXLAN, outside of reading about it.
 ​
 There are two use-cases for this. One is for the above diagram, where I have a special system that must have layer two connectivity. Furthermore, if this works, there will be more than two endpoints, and I would need to provide a common Layer 2 spanning several locations. The bandwidth requirements are low. &lt;10Mbps
 The second use case is to create a form of hyper segmentation, for security. I&#x27;d like to be able to span several VLANs out to certain sites for IOT, guest access, surveillance cameras, etc. All running back to a central firewall, or series of ACLs would control access between the segments. In this network, all the sites are connected by at 1-10 GbE fiber.

                              <span>What&#x27;s everyone using to terminate S2S VPNs nowadays? I was long in the world of Cisco (ASAs, ISR/ASRs) to terminate these in a former life, however now I&#x27;ve inherited a firewall vendor that is less than stellar with their implementation of the kernel routing table. I want to get ideas that are cost effective, as the business I&#x27;m in does a fair amount of 3rd party integrations - and while I&#x27;d love to go Cisco, it isn&#x27;t an effective solution for the bandwidth we need.

 I currently work in the energy sector and required to be on-site everyday even though 90% of my tasks can be completed remotely.
 I hope to eventually get hired somewhere to be at least hybrid. I’m currently working on learning automation and getting my CCNP to become more well rounded to land something remote.

                              <span>Hi
 I always thought the default IPSEC lifetime was 3600 seconds aka 1 hour.. Now looking at a Cisco Firepower Management Center, the default lifetime under the IPSEC section of a Site-to-Site VPN Tunnel says &quot;Tunnel Duration: 28800 Seconds&quot; 
 Google shows mixed results, some people say the default timer on ASA, and IOS Routers are 3600, while others say it&#x27;s the same as on the FMC.. 
 Does anyone know why the default IPSEC Lifetime is 28800 and not 3600 and whether different Cisco products have different default lifetimes? And can you get the IPSEC Tunnel up if both ends have different lifetimes? I know Phase 1 (ISAKMP) can negotiate the tunnel with lifetime mismatch, in that case, the lowest lifetime is used, but is it the same for IPSEC?

I&#x27;m looking for a customization tool for windows 10 to make ideal golden images for some vmware use cases. I&#x27;d like it to first and foremost remove the spyware and telemetry, but after that, configure things like &quot;show file extensions&quot; in windows explorer and such. Can anyone recommend such software for windows 10?

                              <span>We are converting terminated user accounts to Shared Mailbox to retain their emails for regulatory purposes. Now we would like to utilise Inactive Mailbox instead.
 We are running Hybrid Exchange, so to my knowledge to create an inactive mailbox, this is the process:
  
Move the user account to an OU that is not synced to Azure AD while the account is licensed in O365.
 This will cause the account to be deleted in Azure AD while licensed. The license then goes back into the pool and the mailbox is converted to inactive mailbox.
 We can then disable the user account in On-Prem AD and then delete it later on.
  
Retention Policy has been setup in Microsoft Purview to retain items indefinitely.
 My questions are:
  
If you remove the license then delete/unsync the account from Azure AD, will it still create inactive mailbox?
 We used to convert user accounts to shared mailboxes so we have disabled users objects in our Active Directory. If we delete these disabled users or unsync the disabled objects from Azure AD, will the shared mailboxes become inactive mailbox or will it purge the Shared Mailbox instead?

                              <span>Situation: in our business school computer lab, we want to move away from traditional lab computers to hot desk setups, where students can use their own devices, connecting to dock or dock-integrated monitor via USB-C. Students like to collaborate using large LCDs (or even two where there&#x27;s space for us to provide) but we want to get rid of the PCs and let them use the laptops they&#x27;re always carrying with them.
 We want to pilot this in one of our labs, replacing 12 workstations with hot desks. But we&#x27;ll need hard data to compare with usage of traditional workstations to present to management, otherwise the pilot is pointless. (We have all the data we need on the existing workstation usage, via a platform called LabStats.)
 So how do we monitor the usage of the hot desks?

                              <span>A week ago our ERP had some massive issues, such issues that we had to spin up a new oracle database server to move it to due to bad disks on one of our nodes.
 For convince I put up a new server on last Sunday, and the disks were iscsi mounted from our NAS.
 NAS is running TRUENAS SCALE and has a hardware uptime of 200 days which is when we installed it in our colo.
 Scheduled to replace disks in the old node Wednesday, and then to move the oracle server back to said node Sunday, meaning today.
 Yesterday, Saturday, at 09.45 the NAS PSU just flat out died. The entire thing (It&#x27;s a redundant one with two separate power connections) just poof.
 And since it was only for one week, guess who didn&#x27;t make the iscsi connection redundant and make it also live on another of our TRUENAS instances?
 Yup me. The proud moron that had to spend Saturday to call colo tech to let me in, grab the NAS, drive in to the office and replace the psu, so we could power the NAS back on and get our ERP up.
 Even if it&#x27;s temporary, do it right from the get go. Don&#x27;t be a fucking idiot like I am.
 Anyway, just finished migrating the oracle back to it&#x27;s old node with new disks. Time to walk my dog.

                              <span>Hello,
 Does anyone have a recomendation for software suitable for transcribing online meetings?
 We mostly use Teams, but sometimes need to you other meeting platforms like Zoom etc. I am aware that Teams has this feature, but looking for something that works a little better, and maybe has some nifty features.
 Any suggestions would be appreciated.
 Thanks.

 Proofpoint Essential is recommending to configuring Microsoft 365 to direct outbound mail to the Proofpoint Protection Server.
 Is this really necessary or how complicated?

                              <span>If a company asks for help after treating an ex-employee badly, the common advice here is to consult at a high rate.
 This is terrible advice, please stop giving it.
 As a consultant they&#x27;re opening themselves up personally to liability and lawsuits by their former company. Especially if they were treated poorly when they worked there, the company isn&#x27;t going to think twice about it.
 Professional consultants carry liability insurance and have a company or LLC shielding their personal assets from any litigation.
 Making a bit of quick money and screwing your former company isn&#x27;t worth the risk of losing all you have.

                              <span>So a week ago Friday I gave my two weeks notice after finding a new, better position. I decided to leave this job due to being the only on site IT resource, which required 7 day weeks with 10 hours on site and the rest on-call from Black Friday through New Years Eve without receiving any extra pay during those times. In addition this company treats IT needs with extremely low priority until an outage stops production, and kept moving my office anytime someone decided they wanted that space (currently I am in a mice-infested storage closet). 
 I found out late last week that they will not be able to hire a replacement for me until after the new year aside from a weekend temp that has almost no IT experience (weekday needs will be covered remotely by the already-stretched-thin corporate office). This is likely to mean outages that will cause them to miss SLAs and put an already threatened facility perilously close to being shut down. 
 Should I feel guilty about this? I’m getting lots of guilt trips but find myself not really giving a crap. 
 My wife suggested offering to do consultant work for them on my off hours, but called me an asshole for saying that I wouldn’t even think about it for less than $250 an hour.
 Edit: For those questioning if the office moves were real, here are some photos (censored so I don’t dox myself): https://imgur.com/a/CnPwoiu/

                              <span>Our company has a large presence in Asia and the local leadership would like to donate our older laptops to charities focused on underprivileged youths. We have stacks of 3yr old Lenovo Carbon X1s which are still great devices for standard workloads.
 As an IT manager, I want to support this but this brings up two concerns from my perspective:
  
securely removing company data from the devices
 reimaging with a usable copy of Windows
  
We were thinking Blancco for the data wipe. Anyone use this or have alternate suggestions?
 Also, is anyone aware of free educational or charity licensing from Microsoft? Not sure how to provide a legally licensed copy of Win10 on these devices as they will no longer run our corporate image.
 Any thoughts or advice?

When I vmotion a machine the R730 is much slower than the R720. R720 have a PERC H710 and the R730 have a H330 mini. Do you think this is the problem ? Or do you have any idea ? (It&#x27;s not the disk in problem, i reuse the one in my R710)

 &quot;Direct Peering enables you to establish a direct peering connection between your business network and Google&#x27;s edge network and exchange high-throughput cloud traffic&quot;
 So traffic does not reach to VPC ?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had a few days completely switched off and I&#x27;m trying to make sense of the current state of play around the November Patch Tuesday updates and Kerberos and the subsequent OOB updates and the likely December Patch Tuesday updates.
 It seems fairly quiet on here around Kerberos issues and I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s because people have installed the Nov patch and it&#x27;s fine, or installed the Nov patch and the OOB patch and it&#x27;s fine, or if everyone has just backed the hell off patching their DCs and is waiting and hoping it gets sorted out?

                              <span>I wrote this in another post but figure it should be here.
 When I first got started in IT I was doing data reconciliation work for a major semi conductor industry. The job could have been automated but the guy running that division ( a completely different one ) did not want to agree to take on task of data modeling every issue out to be resolved. 
 I&#x27;m very gifted and could do it all in a 2 hours but was groomed to stretch it out because it would mean the next guy had impossible metrics. I had an entire blockbusters worth of movies in my cubical and started coming in at 6 pm working till 2 am to put 8 hours in no one would see was just watching movies for 6 hours. 
 Then I got into a feud with an upstream division that logged everything on Friday at 4pm meaning I couldn&#x27;t go to the bars to drink with my highschool friends. I complained once and they said they would stop, the next week they slammed me with double so I just signed off and went to the bar. 
 Over 5 million dollars got misplaced because I didn&#x27;t file the work and it raised holy hell with the C execs. I walked into a strong arm meeting where they tried putting me on the fire and just said &quot;I quit&quot; right away and suddenly they were my best friends and asking me what I&#x27;d want from a fulltime job. 
 I said nothing and trained my poor replacement who was an average joe family man and he literally cried as I walked out the door. Felt bad but I had a strong edge on my shoulder since I was kid.

                              <span>With the neverending release of newer Windows version, is there any point of updating the Administrative Templates to a newer version if the Windows remains at the same version?
 The security team in my company is saying to always update the Administrative Templates despite our Windows version remains at 1809/20H2. I remember reading somewhere which I can&#x27;t find now that it is pointless to update if we didn&#x27;t update the Windows version.
 Anyone has any idea??

                              <span>Hi All,
 Our small organization has been archiving media content with our own tape library as a standard practice for some time solely dedicated to our ingest/post-production footage, now we are expanding tape backup writing for other non-critical departments.
 The other departments have had a few TBs backed up in their &quot;unlimited&quot; (Google) cloud storage using our corporate network for a few years, now we need a mechanism to access the content in the cloud and download them to an on-premise storage machine with access to writing to the tape library. Additionally, a checksum validation of the files should be done after writing to tape. 
 So far we expect existing content to be around 12-15TB for the newly included department, the data is expected to grow to maybe 20-25% per year. This content will need to be stored for 8 years for data compliance, and we cannot maintain a single (cloud) copy for their department, hence writing to tape is a hard requirement here. 
 What we have so far as a current setup is, 
  
Mac machine with an in-built storage of maybe 500GB free space currently.
 Access to the cloud content via the desktop application (Google Drive).
 Standalone tape writer with connectivity to the mac via thunderbolt 2 (We don&#x27;t have the infra for a windows system to connect to standalone tape writer as of now)
 Rewritable LTO-7 Tapes @ 15TB capacity
  
Full disclosure, on our side of IT we have not been looking into the tape writing side until this requirement came up. On a high level, this new project seems to be very tedious as the backup will be of many individual objects, and not sure whether an MD5 checksum for a list of files contained in a folder using the mac terminal is possible, or if somebody can suggest a safe third-party software app. 
 Would like to know what will be the best approach here? Is using the mac as the storage medium the best option also? We don&#x27;t plan on investing in external hardware.

                              <span>Being a Linux noob, I am actually looking for answer of a very basic question related to Linux distributions. 
 When we create an ISO, we have leverage to include or exclude external packages as per requirement of application. Does a minor change from base makes it a new distribution ?
 There are two main kind of distribution, deb and rpm based, which is based on type of binary package file which favor their package manager. But if both are tyrp of binary packages, then what makes debian a debian, and RHEL a RHEL.. actually, what specifically makes an distro a distro ??

                              <span>The other day I posted about how my virtualization environment collapsed; all the virtual disks were detached from the virtual machines when my storage server went down. Anyway, I only recovered really fast because backing up the virtual machine disks is as simple as creating a snapshot or archive file of the whole disk and tossing it onto a longer term storage. About as easy as backing up a file from your documents IMO.
 How do you do physical drive / server backups? How do you backup hard drives and SSDs without taking them out of the server and cloning? I&#x27;m curious because that&#x27;s one of the bigger empty spots in our documentation.

                              <span>Where do I start? I’m at a point in my career where I’d like to start job hunting for another opportunity but feel like I don’t have the skills to successfully find something better than where I’m already at. 
 I’m the sole IT staff for a multimillion dollar grant program wrapped under a major non-profit. Essentially I have a dotted line to IT, but other than back end things like HR and email, I am responsible for everything else. I’ve been doing it for over a decade so in some sense I don’t have imposter syndrome directly in the role, but at the same time I don’t have deep professional IT experience, and just get by on my own. I leverage a consultant for engineering and largely perform systems administration and support in addition to my others roles. I’m lacking in best practices, oversight and auditing, and ultimately feel like an amateur due to no one requiring anything from me other than “are things working?” 
 I’ve managed fine, overseeing and supporting 9 physical offices, virtual infrastructure and workforce etc, but I feel like I can’t get another job because I’ve largely done everything on my own with little direction and just keeping everything working with the bare minimum. 
 How can I prepare myself for a potential job within an actual IT department with IT professionals that likely have more knowledge than me? And how do I accomplish that without going backwards? I’ve leveraged myself into a senior leadership position within the org beyond just IT, with a heavy emphasis on operational project management and strategic planning (non-IT). 
 Ultimately I don’t feel like I have the skills I need to be successful and I don’t want to be where I am forever. I’m a jack of all trades and an expert of none. 
 Has anyone else been in a similar situation that was able to break through and progress? How did you do it?

                              <span>I see a lot of posts on ACI, both good and bad. From a pure networking standpoint, how many of you could say that moving to ACI was a positive move for both you and/or the organization? From an employment/resume perspective, is it worth learning about, OR - is it eventually going to fade into a different solution/go away? I ask because a lot of posts show problems with the platform/solution, and I wonder about the long term viability of the product. I think the firepower/asa branding has suffered over the past years because of issues with firepower, and I wonder if the same will happen to ACI, or has already happened? Maybe other vendors are already have way better solutions? I&#x27;m just not aware of the solution, and how it is currently/ and will be standing against its competitors long term.... 
 Any feedback is valued.

                              <span>I have a task where I have a laptop that acts as a controller to a set of node devices. I&#x27;m using WIFI and the controller sets a schedule for when the nodes have to transmit data they&#x27;re collecting. 
 How do I make the time between the controller and nodes consistent as small propagation delays are not a problem but something like the system clock may cause issues.
 Would it work to use a countdown instead of specifying a specific time?
 Thanks all!

                              <span>Are there any known PoE issues with the HP ProCurve 2910al-24G-PoE+ (J9146A)?
 For several months, I&#x27;ve had 5 Reolink PoE cameras connected to a refurbished 2910al-24G-PoE+, and all of them went offline over the past couple weeks. The switch currently says it is delivering 3-4W PoE to all cameras, but the port lights only turn on for 1-2. In all cases, neither IP or link-layer pings can reach them.
 The switch is also delivering PoE to two Wifi APs and an unmanaged PoE-in 5-port switch. These three things have continued to function fine, with the Wifi APs being online even longer than the cameras.
 Also, the cables have been tested and verified. They are shielded CAT6 with solid 23 AWG copper wire. Should hold up just fine.
 Back to the cameras, I can&#x27;t seem to get the online. There are 4 different models, all from Reolink, and only the oldest one (out of support) lights up a network port. I&#x27;ve also tried them on a ProCurve 2520-8 (J9137A), and it&#x27;s the nearly the same problem, except that one old camera gets CRC/alignment errors showing up in the switch logs for it&#x27;s port. Doesn&#x27;t matter which port I connect it to.
 The only explanation I can think of, and it doesn&#x27;t make complete sense to me, is that somehow a power outage bricked the PoE Reolink cameras, but not the other PoE devices, and not the PoE switch itself. Perhaps Reolink PoE products are less resilient? Is that plausible?

                              <span>Let’s say an existing site (A) is configured with 172.16.0.0/16 network, for a total of 100 hosts in service currently. 10 of these 100 devices are switches. 
 This is a completely private Switched network for now with no routers available. 
 I need to establish management access to only these 10 switches, from an existing Server having an address of 192.168.0.100/24 at Site (B). 
 (The switch management addresses I want to manage at site (A) are in sequence - 172.16.1.100 to 172.16.1.109).
 My plan was to use a new NIC available at the server with the address 172.16.1.99 and /28 mask, together with a static route in the server pointing to this NIC as the gateway for the /28 network. 
 Subnet mask of the 10 switches at Site (A) would be changed to /28 and a Gateway address of 172.16.1.99 would be added to them as well. 
 My feeling is this isn’t a clean solution, but since I’m not allowed to change the addresses of the switches at site (A), this is the only way I could think of doing it. Does it make sense at all?

                              <span>Good day, 
 I am configuring a HP Procurve 3500yl switch for a new Mitel environment using 6910 Mitel phones. The new vlan 50 (ip address: 172.50.1.2) has been configured, ip helper set to the Mitel controller at 172.50.0.2. LLDP has been enabled. I have tagged port 17 with vlan 50 and untagged 1o which is the data network. When I plug in a phone it is unable to pick up DHCP. When I plug a laptop into the back of the phone, I am getting the 50 vlan and an IP. Did I misconfigure something here?

                              <span>Hey everyone, I recently moved almost all of our switches to authenticate using DUO. We had some switches configured for authentication with old tacacs+ server. My method for deleting the tacacs configuration was to first remove all aaa commands and last “no aaa new-model”. In one of the switches, I accidentally removed all commands except one: “Aaa authorization commands 15 default group tacacs+”. I configured login local for all vty lines and console, but now I’m afraid to configure aaa with Duo. (I had a bad experience with one switch in the past - couldn’t access it when I was trying to configure new aaa config because it remembered all old aaa commands - didn’t remove them at that time). Experienced people, what should I do?

 The data being sent from each device to the access point needs to match the time of the access point and I&#x27;m wondering what mechanism exists that allows for this.

                              <span>When it comes to reviewing signal metrics on your cellular routers, does anyone have a handy method or process to equate signal metrics to user experience?
 Signal metrics both LTE and 5G (of course 5G differs with how it measures SINR for example): RSSI RSRQ RSRP SINR
 Example: running a speed test on the cellular router may show great throughput, decent latency/jitter, but the SINR is poor and fluctuating heavily (up and down vs a solid line). This then seems to result in a bad user experience.
 Teams seem more interested in the speed test results vs breaking down the signal metrics into usable user experience values.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I am looking to wire my Small Business with 10GBe (Future proof) and need PoE for roughly 7 cameras and 7 Wi-Fi Access Points). L3 is required for security and Vlan routing. I was thinking to go Unifi which I have experience with, but then stumbled on this FS S5850-24XMG-U Switch. This switch has 24 copper PoE++ ports and is L3.
 The Unifi switches would cost nearly as much and require several switches, where this looks to be all in one and maybe a better option.
 However, I do not have any experience with FS and there are no spec sheets available for this. I hope a few people here have some experience with this switch.
  
 How loud is it compared to Unifi Switches?
 
 Does it offer a web based GUI management or is all done via CLI (I have no CLI experience)?
  Would there be any other options or what would you recommend for my use case (12 - 14 POE devices, 5 additional rooms, 10GB, NAS and 2 PCs with Wired connections, VLANS and PFSense firewall).

                              <span>ISPs setup internet by creating account and then linking it to the ONT or router and also recording the physical address of the connection. Say, if two customers switch their ONT &amp; router then, can the ISP see using some real time data that customer A moved to a different location?
 How the ISPs notify specific customers about the downtime due to repair or maintenance, using their real time location data or original address database where the connection was setup?

 I tried using the &quot;-N&quot; switch (no-delay) but it does not resolve the issue. 
 Can someone explain what this means and how to resolve it?
 I am doing a test from a linux box to a windows pc (win 11). Both using the same iperf3 (v3.11) using the &quot;-R&quot; switch (windows pc acting as server, linux acting as client, but the -R reverses the direction so Windows sends to Linux,,that is where this message happens..not in any other direction)

                              <span>Hello! 
 Back Story is I am somewhat of a novice as it comes to advanced networking.... I have successfully set up OPNSense, a Brocade 6450, and a Ruckus r710 running the latest Unleashed firmware. My main SSID is set up on the AP and is running perfectly fine. My issue is when I got to setup a second SSID for IoT on my r710. 
 Similar to PFSense, I have configured my router with a Vlan, different subnet of 10.0.10.0/24, DHCP server, etc.... The vlan is tagged as 10 on OPNSense. I have done the same on the R710.... I created a guest network, under WLAN set the VLAN to 10. 
 Then on the brocade, I created a vlan and set the port 48 to dual mode so that the tagged vlan 10 and the untagged traffic should be able to flow, but that hasn&#x27;t worked. I even tried to assign the subnet IP to the tagged vlan 10 with no change. 
 The only thing that has worked so far somewhat is when I set the Vlan tag to 1 in the Guest SSID on the ruckus, but that similar then routes traffic through the untagged rule on the switch which does not achieve the true separation I want for my Vlan. 
 What am I missing here? Any help or direction would be helpful! I have been reading documentation for several hours now, but I am no where closer to solving my problem. Am I missing something simple or am I WAY off base on my understanding of how things needs to flow? Cheers

                              <span>Hi All!
 This area is completely new to me. Am learning to implement Azure Cloud Kerberos Trust while also deploying certificates via Intune using SCEP to users on AAD joined devices to enable SSO to RDP/RDS over the internet. I&#x27;d appreciate any and all guidance that can be offered here.
 The goal here is to allow seamless access via RDP to legacy applications from AAD joined devices when on-prem and outside of the corporate network. Cloud Kerberos Trust works to take care of on-prem SSO to file shares, printers etc. but I am having a lot of trouble with the RDP side.
 Context
 My lab implementation involves a 
  
DC - Server 2019 running IIS (for CRL publishing), AD, DNS &amp; CA
 RDS server - Server 2019 running RDS
 NDES server - Server 2019 running NDES and Intune Certificate Connector
 Lo…</span>

                              <span>I recently have noticed I started getting higher Ping/latency when I have been gaming. I wanted to figure out the reason behind the increase as I have recently upgraded my internet so that wasn&#x27;t the reason. 
 On speedtest I noticed that when I run the download latency it is a normal 20-30, however when its checking for upload speeds, the latency is between 125-1250. Massive spikes happen which is in line with what I am seeing when gaming. I had my father in law test his upload latency just down the street and his upload and download match.
 So I am wondering what could be the cause of the spikes? I haven&#x27;t added any new devices that would cause more bandwidth to be used. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>So we manage sites along the retail/hospitality line that have guest wifi. We normally see maybe 1-2 DDOS attacks per year. We do not host any domains, or any services for that matter, that would allow someone to find out the IP&#x27;s of the sites remotely. Except for a select few, none of the IP&#x27;s are SWIP&#x27;d in arin either.
 So that leads me to be believe someone on the guest wifi at these sites does something to piss someone off on the internet, or its a random/driveby/typo. Typically they are short lived, single incident or maybe two within an evening/day.
 Its almost always in 1hr or 2 hour intervals, which leads me to believe its a DDOS for hire type thing. Always volumetric, so dns/udp/icmp reflection/fragmentation. So since its volumetric and these sites dont have bgp, there isnt anything we can do from our end.
 Most providers arent that helpful, because they want you to pay for their DDOS protection service, which is normally at least 2x+ the MRC of the actual internet service itself.
 Dealing with one now that is lumen/centurylink. Had an event Monday evening, then again last night (didnt notice this as it was 12am) and now this evening again. We stopped using the IP they were hitting, changed the NAT pool to a new IP, but they are still hitting the old IP. To their credit they did do some filtering Monday, but said it was a one time thing and we needed to talk to our account rep. Looking at the bandwidth graph on the lumen portal, looks like it starts out at over 1gbps, but then settles in around 700-800mbps, and we only have 500mbps at the site. Im inclined to just go to 1gbps if im going to throw money at something, but they could just throw more DDOS at it at that point.
 Anyone have any thoughts on this other than it sucks? Thanks!

                              <span>I recently took over as sole IT of an extremely fast growing company (Currently around 70 users) Growing about 3 per week. 
 We have about a 50/50 Mix of Windows and Mac laptops
 We are all cloud based and utilize azure ad joined computers. I am looking for the following -
  
A good imaging solution that works well with Azure AD
 A RMM solution that works well with Azure AD
 Patch management solution that is cross platform for Mac and PC
  
We are a fintech company so we will need to comply with PCI and Soc in the near future
 We currently have Business Premium licenses but will likely need to upgrade to E5 in the near future.

                              <span>I wrote this in another post about a sysadmin having to fire someone for accessing a system they shouldn&#x27;t have. The sysadmin I worked for had a red flag come up and had to fire someone and was torn up because the guy was a genius and it was right before Christmas holiday break. We drank heavily about it. Then after we came back to the office he had to clean out the guys office and put it into a box and discovered the biggest pile of pornography known to man he had created on thousands of CDs, disks, zip drives. They found the guy had written macros completely automating his job and spent 100% of his time collecting, indexing and catologing porn for absolutely no reason. 
 If I recall right ( I was drunk when told so could be wrong ) the company had to call the police incase anything illegal was on the disks but it was so much they didn&#x27;t have the time/budget to go through it all. They tried speaking with the guy but he had moved out of state when his building access got locked. 
 In the end the sysadmin got the full fury of the company for not knowing what was going on and the poor admin spent 2-3 months 7 days a week working to create and implement new security processes and traveling to every branch to install them.
 The guy was only caught because one of our female coworkers had been in the adult industry briefly when she was younger and he somehow recognized her ( they said he had a photographic memory ) and accessed the HR database on her home addresse which was monitored by law.
 I will say this for the company. They put the sysadmin through 3 months of hell but once he finished they gave him a promotion and paid vaca.
 Edit: Because people are saying he stalked her. The sysadmin was able to speak with him once via his mother and the guy said he wasn&#x27;t trying to stalk her only to put her address into the index he made. He was brilliant but OCD about data. That&#x27;s what made him good at his job.

I need this server up by the end of this month. The H750 matches everything and only has 1 sas port vs the two on the 755 all I’m using is the 1 Sas. Port so why wouldn’t it be comparable?
