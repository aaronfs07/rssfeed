                              <span>Good news, we have a greenfield lab with new hardware so this is a chance to design from ground up.
 I&#x27;m deploying Bare metal Kubernetes cluster(s) in a shared network infrastructure. The clusters will run legacy VMs via Kubevirt (virtualization project for K8s). There will also be container &quot;workloads&quot; that are &quot;cloud-native&quot;, but my concern here is the VMs.
 From what I&#x27;ve read, L3 is the way to go, bringing the L3 down all the way to TOR or even the server. Everything is routed, small L2 domains.
 As an example, the K8s networking plugin is Calico. This is a pure L3. Given a cluster-wide IP pool of 10.20.0.0/16, it carves out a smaller subnet (like a /26 by default) and assigns it to each node. Each node is on a different /26 block, and traffic is routed by the node east-west. Outbound …</span>

 I have been told that some devices do not support the use of dhcpv6 and need slaac My question is can slaac and dhcpv6 coexist is same network segment ? I prefer to use dhcpv6 for more control but what if I configure it and client does not support it ?

                              <span>In the past 4 years that I&#x27;ve worked for my organization as helpdesk support, i&#x27;ve come to realize that i&#x27;m somewhat faster than my boss or management/HR in knowing or initiating the next career growth steps or the daily work tasks that I need to carry out. I&#x27;ve in a couple of cases brought up clearly detailed requests for career advancements, daily tasks upgrades etc to my boss but they would get shot down, only for him to come back to me 6 or 8 months later with pretty much 90% of what i had proposed before -as if i had handed him a template. Sometimes its him who would have said to me tell me what you think you need to do or focus on next then i sit down for like a week detailing something only for it to get shot down -it kinda feels like its some secret spying or HR thing that they are doing on me. I feel my career progression is going slooow. I&#x27;m a fast learner and could really move on to other areas. Most of my tasks i have automated, optimized or streamlined into playbooks such that i really have some time on my hands but nope I&#x27;m still in the same position and same tasks.

                              <span>Ok, this should probably fall under the shittysysadmin thread, because that&#x27;s how I feel.... I hope I&#x27;m worrying for nothing. We have a 3 node HCI cluster that hosts about 80 virtual machines. We use Veeam to backup these servers. We have a separate stand-alone hyper-v host that hosts our Veeam servers - a broker server and a proxy. This server has a dual port 10GB card in it. I ordered and received a server to replace this stand-alone hyper-v host. I worked with our vendor to order the new server spec&#x27;d like our current server. I don&#x27;t know where the breakdown happened (I know I screwed up), but the new server did not come with the 2 10GB (SPF+) ports. To make matters worse, there are no available slots in install a card. Before I tell my boss we spent $25K on a server that we can&#x27;t use, I&#x27;d like some feedback. This server&#x27;s sole use is hosting these 2 Veeam servers. The network ports I have are 1GB. How screwed am I? I won&#x27;t lose my job over this, but feel like a noob....

                              <span>Hi! Happy weekend!
 I am looking for some career advice and was thinking this would be a good place to ask.
 I’m currently a network admin, and I focus heavily on config/management of Firewalls and anything behind them for our many customers (MSP).I switched from the Voice side in the same company to the data side about 6 months ago.
 I’ve asked for raises etc, and have not been able to get past $50,000 (In Indiana, with company for 2 years)
 I enjoy and am good at SIP, and was sent a job offer as a Voice Engineer for a large provider expanding into the US, for alittle over 70% more pay.
 To me, that’s life changing money.
 However, even though i feel underpaid, i think the amount of security knowledge i gain week after week is really valuable, and i always hear people talk about trying to break into security, and it seems like i have luckily been able to do so. 
 This new role sparks my interest very much bc i do enjoy voice, but I’m worried about leaving the security space and possibly making it harder to return after my VoIP arc 
 Thanks in advance for any advice!
 Tl;Dr 
 Currently feel underpaid in network security 
 I like voice and got an offer for 70% more as a voice engineer for a large company 
 Worried about it being hard to get back into security after i do VoIP for a couple years

                              <span>I want to have a single SSID with a radius server running on my LAN, which provides the VLANs assignments for the clients.
 I&#x27;ve tried TP Link&#x27;s EAP660, while it does have VLAN, they aren&#x27;t dynamic. It&#x27;s just one VLAN per SSID. The user logs in via radius, but has the regular IP address of the SSID&#x27;s VLAN.
 I&#x27;ve looked into UDM Pro but dislike their ecosystem. I do not need cloud management and their firmware doesn&#x27;t work well if it&#x27;s locally managed (lots of required reboots).
 Any suggestions are welcome. Thanks!

                              <span>Have a Meraki Firewall, Meraki Switch, Couldtrax Access points (OpenMesh). PoE 12 port PoE injector, patch panel leading to an access point that went offline. Bad patch cable. When I replaced the patch cable, couldtrax said it was online and couldn&#x27;t communicate. No matter how many times I disconnected the ports to shut the device off from the server closet it wouldn&#x27;t work. Had to get a 20 foot ladder and unmount and reseat the cable there. Magically it started working.
 ​
 THE BIG QUESTION
 When I have something that happens with a cable with one of these access points, do I need to go directly to the access point and reseat it?
 ​
 Notes: Monitoring it before, it was in and out with connectivity, and I think this was primarily because of the patch cable.
 I didn&#x27;t test the wire run from the server closet to the AP. Did a constant ping with no issues, and thus far, it&#x27;s been consistent with the other 2 AP&#x27;s.
 ​
 ​
 ​
 (wire goes from access point to patch panel, from patch panel to PoE port on on injector, then injector port goes to switch).

                              <span>Every single time I try to upgrade the code on these (AP250s/Atoms) via the cloud based HiveManager (now Extreme Cloud IQ) I run into failures. It&#x27;s hit or miss. The Atoms almost always fail and require a power cycle or a complete factory reset before the update can succeed. The AP250s exhibit the same behavior, but not as often. Sometimes I do have to deactivate PoE on their backhaul ports to get them to eventually behave.
 Every AP is backhauled btw, no mesh. 
 To troubleshoot, I&#x27;ve consoled into a couple while this process happens, but the logs I see give no clear indication of why updates could have failed besides some vague messages about losing connectivity to the cloud.. but they&#x27;re rebooting and won&#x27;t have connectivity to anything. The cloud console gives no information whatsoever after a failure. In the device list, the ones that eventually fail get stuck at 12% on the progress bar... for HOURS.
 These are all legacy Aerohive devices by the way. We had these before AH was acquired by Extreme. Are we running into some kind of planned deprecation situation? The thing that bothers me is even when we were running Aerohive&#x27;s Mangler, this stuff still happened, but not as bad and way less frequent.
 Is extreme/aerohive&#x27;s cloud management just this bad? Or is there something wrong with how these are deployed/operating? These things are workhorses. And after tuning the hell out of the system due to a high-density/high-interference environment, users have been happy. I&#x27;m actually very impressed with the flexibility and features these things provide. But upgrading them takes half a day or more... and it clenches my butt every time.
 Thanks for reading, and thanks for any insight anyone may provide.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m stuck on this problem. I&#x27;m using the Software SynergyCP which is a baremetal provisioning software. It has a DHCP/TFTP server it uses for installing the OS.
 For some reason, I can&#x27;t seem to it to work while on a VLAN. If I take it off the vlan it does (sometimes) boot into the OS installer. I&#x27;m still learning Junos but I figured this would be an easy thing to get going. I was wrong.
 There is also a SRX550 that is the main router for the uplink.
 Here is the SRX config.

 I am somewhat the sole operator of a virtual production LED studio. I&#x27;ve been tasked with a lot of tech that I do understand and some I don&#x27;t mostly related to server networking &amp; ability to send data wirelessly. 
 We will start with the wireless data:
 I have a tracking system called Mosys. It is run on an intel nuc (rehoused with custom software). It feeds data back to one of our network switches via ethernet- which we then send to the server that processes the data. Since this is mounted on a camera, there are a lot of benefits of wireless transmission. While it is a pc (running a flavor of linux) I wanted to know my options for running wireless signal from this pc to our ethernet switch. The pc has usb ports which already support mouse/usb. It also has an ethernet…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been setting up networking (internet and cameras) for a small hotel and restaurant in the Caribbean for the past 3 years. They started off small (just 1 building) but they keep growing. They own about a whole acre of land where they keep building small &quot;bungalows&quot; and container rooms. Now they decided to buy the property across the street and covert it to another 5 rooms for the hotel. They want internet and IP cameras across the street. The &quot;street&quot; is unpaved, and the other property is 84 feet from the office where I keep the modem and router. I&#x27;m leaning toward using Cat 6 or fiber to span this distance. My business partner wants to use a Ubiquity air max bridge. I haven&#x27;t set one of these up, so I don&#x27;t know how reliable or complicated they are. Theres no vegetation in the line of sight, but it rains a lot. Currently I use a Huwei LTE modem/router with 3 Unifi AP&#x27;s. I think I am going to add a load balancing router so I can use two ISPs for more consistency and speed. 
 The owner said we could bury a conduit if we want. Also I could hypothetically use the utility poles to span cable (is that a good idea)? I want something thats going to work 99% of the time. I don&#x27;t live down there so if theres a problem, I have to call and walk someone (usually with very little IT experience) through how to reset a device or trouble shoot. I need reliability.
 I do want to future proof this. If you bury conduit, how deep do you normally go and what diameter do you use? Would you use fiber, Cat 6 cable or a wireless bridge? I really appreciate any help you can offer.

                              <span>What is a good microsegmentation tool for east west traffic?
 We use acls on our core switches primarily (Cisco nexus environment) and some acls on the distribution switches and I’m sure using a microsegmentation tool would be much better in terms of ease of use, visibility and security as well.
 Upon doing some research I came across guardicore and saw a few videos on YouTube and it looks good but I have no idea since I haven’t used it.
 Is it a good tool and what tools does everyone else use and can you recommend some good ones?
 Thank you

                              <span>Good day, I&#x27;d like to start off by saying while my background is in networking(studied in college circa 2008-2010) I have beginner level knowledge at best and after college I never put in the effort to keep up with the trade.
 Please bear with me as my ineptitude may show. For history, most of my professional career has been in enduser support. Recently a colleague of mine left and encouraged me to apply for his old position as a network specialist.
 I took the time to relearn what i could and played in a simulated environment and did i ever learn the hard way how different real hardware vs simulation can be. Anyhow, to the question. During the interview we had to complete a skills test that was set up in a collapsed core configuration:
 Cisco catalyst 9500 as the core/distribution switch and a Cisco Catalyst 9300 as the access. One of the Objectives was to set up an etherchannel link between the distribution and access layer switches and using port channel 1 as the container. The directions were vague so I assumed they&#x27;d leave it up to the interviewee to choose PAgP or LACP so i opted to set each side to channel group mode on. When I tried to apply the configuration both the 9500 and 9300 spit out &quot;command rejected&quot; I forget the exact verbage. In the end, I ended setting the distribution switch to channel group mode active and the access switch to passive and the etherchannel relationship formed. My I&#x27;m just scratching my head as to why mode on was rejected.
 EDIT: fixed some grammar and verbage

                              <span>Hey Ya&#x27;ll,
 I&#x27;m deploying DOT1X EAP-TLS port authentication with a fallback guest VLAN on Cisco Catalyst C3850 switches used for access to offices and shared workspaces. I&#x27;ve followed the Cisco guides and have the proof of concept system working.... mostly. I am running into an issue with DHCP after assignment to the guest VLAN. When authentication fails or times out the port is assigned to the guest VLAN. However the Windows DHCP service times out and self assigns an AIPA address before the DOT1X authentication failure/timeout occurs. The Windows machine will then sit on the Guest VLAN without an IP address for approximately 5 minutes before the Windows DHCP service reattempts a DHCP request and is successful.
 The reason I&#x27;m asking this here, is that I would like to adjust my switch configs to account for this since theoretically devices getting assigned to the guest VLAN won&#x27;t be under my control to adjust Windows DHCP settings.
 Is there a best practice or recommended DOT1X auth timeout?
 The proof of concept is using this setup on the ports:
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/X
 switchport mode access
 device-tracking attach-policy dot1x
 authentication event fail action authorize vlan 5
 authentication event no-response action authorize vlan 5
 authentication open
 authentication port-control auto
 authentication timer reauthenticate 180
 authentication violation replace
 dot1x pae authenticator
 dot1x timeout start-period 5
 dot1x timeout held-period 1
 dot1x timeout auth-period 18

 Is anyone else seeing increased latency for anything going to and from India to Europe?
 We have no real way to prove this as we are in Canada, but ever since the Earthquakes, some of our workers in India have been complaining about latency. Its not all the ISPs that seems to be affected, but the timing is almost spot on.
 Just wondering if you are seeing something similar? 
 In most cases we are seeing a 100ms to 150ms increase from the normal.

                              <span>Hi all.
 I&#x27;ve got a test environment with two Cisco 3560CGs connected together with a link agg. Each port is a 1gb port.
 ​
 Each switch has a port with the same vlan on it. At the end of each vlan is a PC with a 1gbNIC.
 ​
 When doing an iperf test between the PCs, my network monitoring software is suggesting that it is only saturating 1 link out of the two with about a gig of traffic.
 ​
 I was under the impression it would balance the load across the two? Or would this only happen if I was able to generate more than a gigworth of traffic?
 ​
 Thaks for the help!

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m junior system administrator in small company and I&#x27;ve been given a task to redesign network topology since current one is quite awful. We just bought 2 Huawei 10Gb switches and 5 new servers with 4 10Gb NICs each. I&#x27;m not sure how I should set up the network core.
 I was thinking of stacking switches in master/slave configuration, then use LAG to connect my servers to the core. 4 servers&#x27; NICs bond into 1 logical NIC, and split 2/4 cables to one switch and the remaining 2/4 to the other. As I understand it, this should give me high redundancy (one whole switch can die and connection will still be ok) and high throughput (some traffic will come to main, some to secondary; total speed should be around 35-40Gb).
 ​
 Is this setup viable, am I going the right way, will it be manageable in the future?

                              <span>Hey there, currently trying to understand the apphosting ports on our Cisco Catalyst 9300 Switches. Relatively new to the whole concept, I am currently wondering, do I need the offical Cisco 120GB SSD module, or does any usb3.0 usb stick suffice? I don’t think I can persuade my boss to buy one of those modules without having a 100% confirmation that we will be using them. A 120GB usb3.0 usb stick on the other hand would be easy to buy for us…

                              <span>Hello! 
 I&#x27;m a one man IT guy for a small business and would like to replace a file server that is used by about 20 users and currently has about 500gb of files and an MS Access DB. I would just like some advice/recommendations about the below config. 
 Edit: It would need to run Windows Server for AD and GPOs. The CPU was selected for the potential of a VM or two.
 Selected Configuration From Dell 
 Model: Dell T150
 CPU: Intel® Xeon® E-2378 2.6GHz, 16M Cache, 8C/16T, Turbo (65W), 3200 MT/s
 RAM: 16GB UDIMM, 3200MT/s, ECC
 HDD: 1TB 7.2K RPM SATA Entry 3.5in x2 in RAID1 for the OS
 OS: Windows Server 2022 Standard
 I would upgrade the OEM RAM with a 2x16gb kit of Crucial Memory since Dell’s memory prices are crazy
 https://www.amazon.ca/Crucial-2x16GB-Desktop-Memory-CT2K16G4DFRA32A/dp/B08C4LXXCJ/ref&#x3D;sr_1_15?crid&#x3D;2AODYT3GKVL8D&amp;keywords&#x3D;32%2Bgb%2Budimm&amp;qid&#x3D;1676687994&amp;sprefix&#x3D;32%2Bgb%2Bud%2Caps%2C106&amp;sr&#x3D;8-15&amp;th&#x3D;1
 For main file storage I would add two WD Red 10tb drives in RAID1
 https://www.amazon.ca/Red-10TB-Internal-Hard-Drive/dp/B084F34HZ6/ref&#x3D;sr_1_10?crid&#x3D;22QYI0B4E6ZMG&amp;keywords&#x3D;10tb%2Bhard%2Bdrive&amp;qid&#x3D;1676687392&amp;sprefix&#x3D;10tb%2Caps%2C106&amp;sr&#x3D;8-10&amp;th&#x3D;1

                              <span>I have years of field experience running drops, working in racks etc. All side jobs because my primary job is as a Firefighter for a small local city. Recently, they told me I could replace a short drop or contract it out. Great... after 14 yrs we have a new IT director who is fine with non critical drops being ran with a klein scout 3 and not certified. Wrong. We got a call back that it must be certified.
 What is the cheapest tool I can use to print out a cable certification. 
 Kind you, we have fiber running into switches with cat5 ( NOT CAT5E ) runs. I digress, I&#x27;d honestly rather do this myself than contract it out. Because it opens possibilities of me doing work and upgrading our fire stations since our it contracts all of that work out. 
 Thanks

                              <span>Sorry if this is the wrong sub reddit. I am asking because I saw a few UKG posts here before in searches. 
 My multi state grocery store company has used Kronos for a long time now. My new store manager started using UKG to create weekly schedules. So our schedules went from two pages to around eight a week. I am supposed to be able to us UKG Dimensions and see my Kronos punches and schedule. Well I put in the url that my company says to put in the UKG site and app. I can see my Kronos punches fine. But it randomly shows the schedule. Never the current schedule or upcoming, but it will show what it was two weeks ago sometimes. 
 What I am wondering is... Is there a box/setting the manager has to have selected while making the UKG schedule to have it show up on the UKG Dimensions website/app? I can find no UKG help board that does not require a sort of membership to even ask them. So I thought I would try here.

                              <span>All of us know how stressful and unstructured our profession can be at times.
 You may wake up in the night with anxiety over being breached, a system going down, lack of funding. You might cut lunches short or remove them altogether to stay on top of your work, or stay after hours to finish projects.
 Ask yourselves, how many sales people, general managers, executives, HR workers, etc are approaching their jobs in this manner?
 Remain calm and embrace a little bit of apathy. You must embrace a little apathy in order to succeed in this industry. 
 There is no perfectly secure network or organization. Downtime happens, things break, and it takes time to fix. Users can wait.
 Give your users longer than anticipated expectations. You can fix this in a day? Tell them it may be a week. Someone …</span>

                              <span>I felt really bad and felt sick and completely lost my appetite yesterday. 
 So it was very simple task. User was not receiving an email from certain email address(it is a distribution list address) in their outlook. So I wanted to forward the email coming to that email address to user&#x27;s email address. 
 To do this we have to change the mailbox in OWA to the distribution list address and set forwarding settings to user&#x27;s email. But some reason my brain lagged and I forwarded user&#x27;s email to that address. The user called me next day saying that there are no emails /receiving email in their outlook client/OWA. I immediately knew what I did and disabled the forwarding setting and they were able to receive emails again. But emails during forwarding setting was enabled was not in their mailbox. I checked with our l2 team and they said it impossible to do anything in this case. I also did not check keep a copy during forwarding. 
 So not only I did not do my job, I created a task for user where they have to request the sender to send the emails again which is a very troublesome task depending on how many emails they received during that time. I requested user to check if the emails could be sent again yesterday. Or they have to contact the distribution list owner and send their emails back. Now I am waiting for user response and depending on their response I might lose my job. I had a panic attack and still thinking about it. How I could do such a simple mistake. I am doing help desk for 1year and never felt like this. I am not sure If we can share this here. I just wanted to share it to someone.

                              <span>We have a Zoom conference room where all of the outer walls are not fishable because it was a dumb preexisting design. One is an exterior building wall which has continuous windows and the others are continuous glass panels.
 We would like something that can update via wifi to show if the room is in use or not but which does not require constant recharging like the usual scheduler iPads and tablets do.
 Even the union electrical and AV guys who helped us configure the space did not have a great cost effective solution. So I wanted to see if one of you had found a good workaround for this already so we don&#x27;t have to reinvent the wheel for no good reason.

                              <span>Two years ago I posted about failing Windows 10 machines failing updates Unfortunately and frustratingly, we are still seeing this problem in our environment. If anything, it seems like the issue has gotten worse. The only fix that helps temporarily for most systems is to push a in place upgrade task sequence via SCCM. This seems to correct whatever component store/SXS corruption initially, but the problem is it seems like for many systems, the problem resurfaces in a month or two. We&#x27;ve since had two Premier tickets with Microsoft without any identification of a root cause. We have looked for various underlying trends such as build process, PC model, installed features/software, antivirus, etc but have been unable to pin it down. We&#x27;re still using WSU, but we don&#x27;t believe the issue is on the update server side. It just seems that at some point these machines get corrupted and no amount of SFC or DISM will fix them. In place repair will fix them but only temporarily. Anybody else deal with similar issues? It&#x27;s frustrating to deal with in an environment where 100% patch compliance is expected.

                              <span>What’s your top advice to someone starting a new sysadmin role?
 What should my 30/60/90 day objectives be?
 How should I “manage“ my manager eg. if there’s no structured 90 day on-boarding process, how do I create one? My experience at past roles has been varied, usually am told to read documentation, check the backlog &amp; review the ticketing system to get familiar with common issues. I feel like there’s a better way to set myself up for success.
 I have the natural instinct to want to “fix everything“ and jump right in to the backlog to look productive. Is this a good idea or should I spend a few days/weeks understanding the environment? I want to be helpful but I don’t want to come off as a know-it-all who says everything needs to be changed. Also, I’m aware that some organizations want the end solutions but don’t want the pain of change, so it‘s never a simple process. I feel that starting with documentation may be a better start and mapping out how the IT infrastructure is designed, but not sure what’s next before getting in the weeds.
 I want to make a good impression and ramp up quickly. But I don’t want to set an expectation that I will work late because I need work/life balance to be physically &amp; mentally healthy. Is it a bad look to go home on time when you’ve just started a new role.
  
Thank you for the advice!

 Is this normal? Is it some kind of Agile thing? 
 Time we used to spend simply getting work done is now spent sitting in meetings with dozens of people most of whom have no stake in topic.
 Honestly feels like people are trying to cover for their lack of expertise.

In the interview he claimed familiarity with GitHub Actions, Terraform, and bash, and was upfront that some of the tools in our stack would be new to him but he was willing to learn. His references were glowing.
 In his first couple months I tasked him with adding to our existing Ansible-based automation so he could learn not only Ansible but also how all our stuff fits together.

 My Experience:
 I worked for a couple small MSP&#x27;s and it was absolutely horrible. At the time I was just happy to be getting experience but looking back, these were very sketchy workplaces. One place the owner bullied you and verbally abused you. The other underpaid everyone, hired family members to &quot;work&quot; for them (pretty sure this was being done in order to evade paying higher income taxes), lied about giving raises for completing certifications…</span>

 However, when I am on my deathbed, and I am about to die, my purpose will be for nothing. For me to survive, that life is gone. And the rich just got richer. nothing else will have benefited from what I have done, and this life seems complete wasted.
 How do you live a purposeful life after contributing to not much. What do you do outside of work that gives fulfillment. Especially that our existence is of nature, and we sit behind computer screens all day.

 Edit: Thank you for the comments, even the harshly-undertoned ones. Listening to what I don&#x27;t know, or what I am not aware of fully.

 Not once. Never. 
 I used to hate printers. Now I just don&#x27;t really care, it&#x27;s a non-problem. My painful days with HP are over.

                              <span>I will try to make this explanation short. My company uses an old Enterprise Resource Program (ERP) that uses Java as part of its components. It is truly solely IE dependent for other reasons as well. I have established that over the last 4 years since I began here. I, of course sounded the alarm years ago to management repeatably that IE had an expiration date. They began the lengthy project of upgrading to a cloud version roughly a year ago. This project also is folding in two other ERP programs into this upgrade so you can imagine the huge amount of work going into this. We are projected to go live with this in May.
 I missed the announcement from Microsoft that they would be putting an arrow through the heart of Internet Explorer on Valentines day and I am just discovering users that have had it updated. Basically if you try to use IE it automatically redirects to Edge. The previous settings in Edge under settings&gt;default browser&quot; allowed you to disable the redirect. That is all gone now. I have tried uninstalling all the MS updates on their computers from Feb 14 to date. But none of them seem to give back the capability to use IE. It seems to be the version of Edge 110.0.1587.46 had the options available so that you could stop it from redirecting. Now under version 110.0.1587.89 they are gone. I am trying to find a way to roll this back and possibly stop a major work stoppage for my company. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

 Thanks!

 Navigate to the license renewal by phone, bring about 30 minutes of your time and maybe a cup of tee and call the US Hotline ((001) 888 571-2048).

 Based on responses and testing, this is the fix that has worked 100% of the time so far for us. Logging out of the effected user and logging back in as a different user and running this script renames the Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy folder and when you log back in as the user it recreates the folder and seems to fix the issue.

 Hope this helps!

The toaster is appearing to ask for delay install or apply immediately. If the user is doing nothing then the task is delay. How making it install if the user does nothing.
 Even if my catalog and drivers are locally on the computer, DCU seems still looking for Dell.com. In the repository, I have the XML and the cab and I am using the cab as the sources. Should I remove the xml? Soing something else?

                              <span>I push out a selection of Powershell scripts that a number of scheduled tasks rely on, or have an alias to make things easier for staff (like fixvpn). 
 Today we&#x27;ve made changes to our VPN, so we need to rename the Service name in our fixvpn script, and therefore need to update the fixvpn.ps1 file.
 However, the only way I can get Group Policy to actually roll out the updated file is to set the Action to &quot;Replace&quot;. This isn&#x27;t ideal as it means that every time a computer runs gpupdate/logs in, it will download that file, and the &quot;Apply once, do not reapply&quot; setting doesn&#x27;t seem to work with &quot;Replace&quot;. I also have no idea how long a computer can go for without being booted up/signed in, so it&#x27;s less of an &#x27;enable and forget&#x27; thing.
 I even tried resaving the file under a different name temporarily, deleting the old file, and uploading the new file with the correct name, in case it was leaning on some kind of file ID or creation date, but still, the script remains unupdated.
 Am I really supposed to run this under &quot;Replace&quot; and have files copied over from SYSVOL every 90 mins?

                              <span>So the issue is Outlook Desktop having no connection to Exchange, and displaying an error when trying to Send/Recieve Folder and displaying the &quot;Sign in/Fix&quot; button in File-&gt;Office-Account. Mails are neither sent nor recieved. First user reported it on Monday, it was solved with 2 reboots, other user was solved with creating a new profile after the Outlook repair kicked in. But we also have two users where the local Office programs straight up do not work anymore. Word, Excel display the Yellow Warn symbol top right next to the profile pic. Also displaying the &quot;Account Problem log in again&quot; and when you click on it, the MS login/MFA windows appears with &quot;Please wait&quot; and closes. Sign-In protocols in Azure for the affected users are all successful. Even tried the Outlook repair thingy, which created a new profile, but after that we were not able to add the users account to Outlook. It just fails. For Excel and Word, when you try to open a File from SharePoint in the Desktop App, you get an access-denied error, when you say open it Excel/Word online no problem. According to MS support try to close all Office programs, delete all saved Windows Login Credentials regarding Office and OneDrive. But the affected users only have OneDrive creds stored, as I have both, so maybe this is a step torwards a solution.The Web &quot;Variants&quot; work without a problem for the affected ones, so it&#x27;s a viable workaround atm.

 Maybe someone has the solution or some hint.Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Just curious as I&#x27;m trying to, slowly, learn to use Wireshark properly. Some years ago I stayed in a big chain hotel in London next to the British Library. Bored in my room I did a network scan of the free WIFI they provided. To my horror I could see everyone else&#x27;s device, even an old server I think they may not have been using anymore that appear to monitor temperatures. I reported this while there and they promptly locked everything down (essentially just turning on WIFI isolation).
 This time I&#x27;m on a cruise ship and not brought my Alfa card with me. Not done an nmap scan as I know about the legality of that. But thought running WIFI shark while I&#x27;m connected to check my on ship account shouldn&#x27;t hurt. But noticed loads of MDNS entries at all the other guests devices. All their device names. Surely this shouldn&#x27;t be visible if they had WIFI isolation on?
 Isn&#x27;t this a slight security issue or am I making something of nothing because I&#x27;m just not understanding the Wireshark trace?

 My org is about to implement a new to us ticketing system (ServiceNow). As part of that, we proposed rebuilding our monitoring environment from scratch in order to remove as much of our decade of customization as possible, as it has built-in integration with ServiceNow.
 We are currently using Solarwinds SAM and NPM to monitor our environment - Windows, RHEL, AIX, vCenter &amp; ESX, Nutanix AHV, and Cisco/F5/CheckPoint/PaloAlto networking equipment (along with a few random other manufacturer devices we&#x27;re monitoring via SNMP); including some items on AWS and Azure.
 The rest of my team has suggested we explore other monitoring solutions that can handle monitoring all of the above items. Part of this drive is because we&#x27;re paying 455k for our annual support/license renewal …</span>

 So far what I&#x27;ll be doing includes -
 *managing video security feed
  
video and server data backups (local and Azure)
  
*Microsoft licence management for users
 *Security door card management 
 *Learning medical software so I could assist doctors, nurses and reception with software problems
 *general help desk support
 *local server maintenance
 *printer troubleshooting and cartridge replacements
 *Implementing my ideas for improvement if I see some parts where we could do something better or more efficiently 
 *Creating and presenting basic IT courses for staff to get basic understanding of computer/software usage to acceptable level.
 Help me learn and thrive.

 I am turning to you, not necessarily for advice but maybe some of you have experienced something similar.
 Rewind two years: I am originally from the UK but moved to a central European country and in the process landed a great job. In the past two years it slowly started to dawn on me how this &quot;Great job&quot; was nothing more than a toxic, political mess with insecure management and a sense of genuine contempt to said management. Hey what&#x27;s new right?
 The issue fast forwarding to now, due to restructuring, cost cutting it means that some of us have to go. The issue that I have is while fine this happens to everyone, it seems they are cutting off the foreign workers and what makes this even better is I know why. Our contract basically states that we are freelancers, we are essentia…</span>

The current setup is an Ubuntu LTS that we connect to using putty, but for that I have to connect using TeamViewer which doesn&#x27;t seem like the best option cause then I depend on the client being there. The thing is I&#x27;ve been thinking about installing a thin client where that device is placed but I feel like it&#x27;s too much for what I need. Just accessing a remote SSH that&#x27;s forced to be in a local network. I&#x27;ve been looking around and I&#x27;ve seen many posts about KVM but I wanted to know if there&#x27;s a better option for this.

                              <span>Can anyone see any benefit to Backing up AD on Windows Server Essentials.
 My understanding is that the reason to back up AD is to avoid USN rollback issues in the context of replication. But with only a single domain controller - is there any point? I&#x27;m assuming that in this context a system state backup will suffice?
 Any thoughts on reasons why I may want to install an agent to specifically backup AD?

                              <span>Hello my fellow sysadmins,
 I wanted to pick your brains regarding a decision thatI have to take.
 I am for about 14 years a sys admin/engineer. In the last couple of years I am also a team leader and recently I was presented with the opportunity to get a managerial position as a Director of IT.
 I am struggling to make a decision on whether or not to make the jump to a dedicated management position or stay in the half tech/management I do now.
 I understand that this is something very personal and every person values different things and priorities in their lives, but I would appreciate to get the feedback of some of you that made the jump (or did not made the jump), what played role on your decision and how did this turned out.
 Thank you and have a nice day

                              <span>Hi all,
 ​
 So I&#x27;ve been tasked with getting Dell BIOS on a fleet of Latitude laptops up to date as soon as possible. I&#x27;ve investigated several different methods and I&#x27;ve run into problems with each of them and wondered how others do this effectively.
 We&#x27;re looking to deploy in a way which has no user input or action other than looking at the BIOS update screen for a little while which is fine - to computers which are already out in the field.
 ​
 We have:
 - BitLocker enabled on all computers
 - BIOS password enabled on all computers
 - Dell Latitude 7000 series
 ​
 ​
 Windows Update for Business
 -----------------------------
 I&#x27;ve investigated using Windows Update for Business which appears like a very good solution, as it doesn&#x27;t required dealing with BitLocker suspension, or BIOS pas…</span>

 I have to learn Azure soon or I might be useless and dead weight.. 
 Is it really that hard? Like is it basically a WebUI for Hyper-V with other bells and whistles?
 I&#x27;ll be doing some research and I guess a free trials to fuck around.. 
 Any tips and tricks to look out for? I&#x27;m pretty good with PowerShell if that makes it easier?

I&#x27;ve also had one user report the reverse where a load of emails have suddenly appeared.
 I assumed connection issues but this has been with a mix of on-site and remote workers so seems less likely.
 I thought it was probably an issue with MS and so had a search online expecting to see loads of people with the same issue, however that does not seem to be the case. 
 Has anyone else noticed this recently?

There is an article related to this https://kb.synology.com/sv-se/DSM/tutorial/How_to_join_NAS_to_Azure_AD_Domain but it only seems to apply to users connecting to the DSM. We have a set up where users connect directly to the server via windows explorer or the finder in macos, but they currently have a username and password (when connecting to the server I would like for them to use their AAD account instead) Has anyone tried setting up SSO with Synology to manage permissions and such? Any good guides to follow?

                              <span>Hey everyone.
 So today was the first time in my professional life that I outright snapped.
 I got an email this morning regarding an external audit, and that the auditor requested access to specific documents within our organization, you know, standard stuff.
 In my ignorance, I thought that the user would simply share a OneDrive folder/make a team/create a Sharepoint site.... or at least call me for help... but oh no...
 I got an email stating &quot;I solved the issue, and we now have a Dropbox account with all the sensitive info publicly available, have a nice day&quot;
 I never thought I got get this angry with a user, but here we are...
 I promptly called said user, deleted the documents, deleted Dropbox (considered deleting the user from existence), create a OneDrive folder with said documents and shared it with only the auditors.
 While this was going on, the user kept saying that it was my fault that the user was forced to use Dropbox, that the user could not bother to ask me for simple stuff like this and that the user did not receive any formal IT training in all the years the user had been alive, which also was my fault.
 You can guess how my reaction to this barrage of BS went... 
 I hope you all had a better morning.

                              <span>I just read this article: https://blogs.vmware.com/performance/2017/03/virtual-machine-vcpu-and-vnuma-rightsizing-rules-of-thumb.html
 The examples at the end make it clear how I should rightsize my VMs to align with the physical host. The problem is, we have clusters with ESXi hosts with different # Cores and different # Sockets. For example, in one cluster we have a host with 6 cores (Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2620), 8 cores (Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2630 v3 @ 2.40GHz) and 12 cores (Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2650 v4 @ 2.20GHz). 
 The cluster is EVC enabled with at Intel® &quot;Sandy Bridge&quot; Generation. These CPUs typically have 1-4 Cores. (4-6 Extreme, 2-8 Xeon).
 I&#x27;m a bit confused how I align my vCPUs in this example. I would assume I align with the host with the least amount of cores, so 6. Btw, we are running ESXi 7.0.3.
 Example 1: VM with 4 vCPUs
 &#x3D;&gt; VM configuration: 1 socket with 4 cores 
 Example 2: VM with 8 vCPUs
 &#x3D;&gt; VM configuration: 2 sockets with 4 cores 
 Example 3: VM with 16 vCPUs
 &#x3D;&gt; VM configuration: 4 socket with 4 cores 
 Am I getting this right?

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 after 9 years in IT, I had my big upsi moment.
 I was setting up a new WSUS in an environment. It was planned to rollout monthly updates in 4 rings. Test, Auto update 1, Auto update 2, manual update. So far so good. Created the gpo and put the servers in the group.
 Well, yesterday it happened... The downloaded 02.2023 Update was downloaded the day after patchday. So far so good. Only the servers within the Test group installed it. BUT then yesterday, every server just went to the WSUS, installed the updates and rebooted automatically. Even the ones that are in the manual group.
 ​
 The thing that confuses me the most is
  
I put in a time, when the servers should NOT restart --&gt; get&#x27;s ignored
 The updates were planned to be installed at the end of this week + next week
 No matter if I put the &quot;Configure automatic update&quot; GPO to option 4 (auto download, install and reboot to schedule) or to option 3 (auto download notify for install), they&#x27;ll always immediately download and install them.
  
I have no clue what&#x27;s wrong and tried to re-create this behavior in my LAB. So far I don&#x27;t run into the same issue...
 ​
 Will have a review later today. Guess I better prepare to get a new job...

                              <span>I work at a secure prison facility and I&#x27;m looking into expanding my role and responsibilities. Atm, we have antiquated group polices setup on about 100 workstations (used by medical staff) that the county IT people refuses to fix and frequently interrupts work. I have a big meeting with every manager involved and some changes could happen due to finger pointing between us contractors and county officials. 
 Essentially my wishlist would be to have county setup a separate domain controller with no original scripts running, so I can implement what I see fit. 
 I believe all I would need access to is a server connected to countydomain2 correct? 
 I should have no issue swapping user profiles from one domain to the other. I also believe that they will still be able to access their original county controlled emails via outlook correct? 
 Am I going about this completely wrong or is there something I&#x27;m missing?

 Hi all, for starters I am 23 years old who has been working with AWS infrastructure and has just passed the AWS Solutions Architect. I have been working in the cloud for about two years now and essentially I just provide managed services and maintain a few companies cloud infrastructure. I pretty much solve a variety of issues like an MSP would except I am the only employee for 12 hours of the day handling tickets, server maintenance, end-users calling asking me to explain what the &quot;app&quot; store is etc etc.
 Anyways tonight, I had received a ticket from a Network admin for one of the companies I provide services for asking for a new server to be created and manually joined to the domain. He asked me to use an AMI (Am…</span>

                              <span>Hello guys,
 currently in our production we have a special vlan for cnc machines and a special vlan for clients in the production. Most of the machines are using SMBv1 (you cant change that, because most of them are too old) and I want to implement a SMBv1 Proxy for this.
 The clients access the machines directly over SMBv1 to their network shares to integrate or remove the production files on the machine.
 Unfortunately I dont have the real time to get in the topic so I&#x27;m searching for a company which could do that and also maintain this solution (most important part). 
 Any idea of companies which do that kind of &quot;production&quot; things?

                              <span>I’m sure the consensus here will be that we should always put a clean image on them because of all the bloatware etc… but it hasn’t always been that way. Used to be able to remove a few things, run a couple rounds of windows updates and throw on the domain and it was fine. Seems like for the last couple years we always have to reimage the laptop. If we don’t we have issues with the CPU maxing out at 100% on weird built in system processes. Anyone else see that and/or have a solution for It. It’s also weird that we don’t have to do it on the desktops we get from them.
 For reference we’re a relatively small shop and don’t have put out a ton of laptops all the time. I’d say 2-3 a month. If we didn’t have to do a full reimage, we typically install office 365, sophos AV, ninja RMM client, forticlient VPN, run a round or two of windows updates then add the computer to the domain. I also run Dell command update and remove optimizer.
 Just looking for any suggestions other than reimage them every time. I’ve built MDT servers in the past so I know that’s an option, but don’t think i do enough computers to justify the time investment yet.

 There is a &quot;Fachkraftmangel&quot; (lack of skilled work(ers)) in Germany or at least the government thinks so.

                              <span>Ive been in the MSP space my entire professional life. 16+ years. I’m pretty comfortable with most things, and feel mighty competent most times. 
 But.. I’ve got this client with an assortment of printers. All 5+ years old, some are Xerox Phaser, some HP LJs, they all suck. One phaser says MPC error randomly until you reboot it. One LJ has black streaks (client buys knockoff toner because apparently the legit stuff is too expensive), another LJ prints rainbow like all the cartridges leaked. One HP LJ ghosts images / print. My recommendation is to replace them, or go with MFPs that are proper and under a support contract, but the client just expects me to magically fix all these. 
 Is this a legitimate frustration, or is this something an experienced IT admin should be able to do, and do I just suck?

                              <span>Our anyconnect speed is painfully slow. 500 up/down at HQ and no matter where I try it from I&#x27;m lucky to get over 10Mbps up/down.
 Always been slow on our 5516 and expected much better speed through the new firepower but not much improvement at all.
 Full tunnel (not split tunnel).
 Expect a bit of overhead but whew not that much....

                              <span>Hi All, 
 I have always been confused with the retention policies in M365. So hopefully someone here can clarify this for me. 
 If you enable retention policy to retain all data indefinitely in M365 via Microsoft 365 Data Lifecycle Management so it applies globally to all M365 apps (exchange, onedrive, sharepoint etc.). What happens if you disable a user account and remove the license?
 - Will the retention policies be applied to users One Drive?
 - Will the retention policies be applied to users emails? I know its not going to create inactive mailbox but can you still search the emails from/to this users via eDiscovery?
 - What happens after 30 days, 60 days or 90 days when the standard Microsoft retention period (outside M365 Data Lifecycle Management) expires? Will the data get deleted or will the retention policy kick in and all data will still be available via eDiscovery?
 The key here is, I dont care about restoring user data, it is more for compliance/legal purposes so as long as their data is searchable and can be found within e-discovery, I am happy.
 I keep getting conflicting messages from few M365 consultants. Some saying you need to delete the account when the license is still intact otherwise retention policy wont kick in. Others are saying it should apply the retention policy setup globally regardless. I dont want to find it the hard way so im just gathering some information here and there while waiting an official answer from M$.

                              <span>Interesting problem I am having. I have looked all around to get this to work but nothing seems to stick out as wrong.
 I have two offices and 1 AD. I am trying to get the remote office to be able to communicate with the AD. I can ping the ip address of the AD from the remote office just fine. However, it will not allow me to Join the AD from the remote office.
 Any suggestions? I&#x27;m kind of out of ideas on this one. 
 EDIT: I have also changed the dns on the computer I am trying to join to the ip address of the AD.

                              <span>This is such a dumb question but how do people manage a bunch of users, servers, and computers within a building or given area?
 I manage at max, maybe 50 computers and 25 servers actively and it gets hard sometimes. I use a mix of AnyDesk for personal machines, Mesh Central, and traditional RDP for more business related systems. 
 Sometimes ensuring systems are up to date, secured, deployed correctly, configured with up to date information, etc gets really difficult, I wanna know how y&#x27;all do it. 
 I have deployed some servers that run by themselves pretty okay; they provide the services they need too and do it well. They auto update, and I automated some of the trivial tasks. But some machines, I feel like I can&#x27;t leave alone or else they will become problematic. I want to know how y&#x27;all manage these kinds of systems or manage a fleet in general. 
 I don&#x27;t even have 100 machines and it seems to be overwhelming at times.

                              <span>Been seeing a few posts lately about being burnt out or having mental problems. As a person who has depression and ADHD I know the feeling all too well. But I am here to tell you that your job isn’t as important as your life is. Take a day off (or longer if needed) if your feeling down, take a break or two during work and get away from your desk. And please, talk to someone about how your feeling. Weather it’s a psychiatrist, your primary dr, or even a loved one, don’t keep your feelings bottled up. 
 You can get through this and things will get better.

                              <span>Just a heads-up: Contrary to chatter on the Internet and Microsoft&#x27;s own patch notes, I have now confirmed the Secure Boot problem caused by KB5022842 (the February 2023 update for Windows Server 2022) also affects installations other than on VMware.
 I have two machines that are running Server 2022 on bare metal, and that are now refusing to boot due to Secure Boot failure. Other machines appear to be unaffected. The two in question boot after Secure Boot is disabled. Both happen to be older desktop-class computers used for software testing purposes, but I wouldn&#x27;t put money on this problem only affecting non-server class hardware. (HP EliteDesk 800 G2 Mini, Lenovo M93p Tiny; confirmed that both have the latest firmware available.)
 As others have noted, the problem only shows itself on the second reboot after KB5022842 is installed.
 Be careful! I&#x27;d be willing to bet that this problem affects a lot more machines than is currently being reported. Might be worth pre-emptive testing to ensure a panic doesn&#x27;t ensue if Server 2022 machines need to be restarted in the course of business before this problem is fixed.

                              <span>Back in the early 2010s when was but a young Sysadmin I went to an architecture office with roughly a dozen users, one switch, Linksys router\wifi (you know... normal stuff) and We were upgrading them to a POE switch, IP phones, business grade router, new PCs, monitors, the whole network in a box sales job. Everything was pretty normal until I noticed everyone was watching me as I entered &quot;Bobs office&quot; just to see my reaction. 
 Bob was a special kind of hoarder. Bob liked his paper. Blueprints, White plotter blueprints, Legal sized paper, A4 for some reason, and normal Printer paper. You would think this is normal... and you would be wrong. Bob had this paper from print jobs EVERYWHERE. My words cannot easily describe what I mean by EVERYWHERE. The entire floor.... white paper. Every surface in the office, paper with an avalanche of paper drifting down to the floor... His chair HAD PAPER IN IT with some weird blueprint rolls off the back of the chair making a backrest. I have no idea if his desk was wood or metal because all I saw was paper avalanching off of the 2 sides of the desk not against the wall all the way down to the floor. His monitors were sat on mounds of paper and I had to remove the paper FROM ONTOP OF HIS KEYBOARD!!! Mentally picture fresh powder on a mountain ready for skiing, but replace the snow with paper, this was his entire office, floor to nearly celling. The door would not close because of the 3+ inches of paper on the floor. A normal box of printer paper is 5,000 sheets. His office easily had 500,000 sheets of paper in it, and that may be a conservative estimate because I am over here doing math on how much volume that many sheets of paper would be, and its still not enough. 
 When I left the office I played it cool and asked when their last inspection from the Fire Marshall was, the Office Managers face got red and she mumbled something about having &quot;Bob pick up after himself&quot;.

                              <span>I am extremely interested in automating some tedious manual tasks I preform on a monthly basis.
 I know a little bit of powershell (I know a little python too) and I have been attempting some test scripts working up towards my actual automation project.
 I&#x27;m open to delving into Python or Powershell if any of you experienced automaters think I will have a much easier time of things with one or the other.
 Now this is a windows environment (If powershell didn&#x27;t make that obvious lol) and I am running into all sorts of permissions and security issues.
 ​
 The eventual goal is to have a script (When does a script turn into a program lol) that can go out to multiple PCs on my network, check the version of an application against the version I specify, and then run an .exe if the version is previous.
 So obviously a program roaming around the network launching executables is not something Windows appreciates.
 ​
 I&#x27;m just playing in a test environment at the moment, but I&#x27;m starting to have doubts about how anything I ever write would be able to be ran in prod due to security factors.
 ​
 Am I missing something here? I do NOT come from a coding background, I&#x27;m more of a Windows/Networking generalist. I feel like learning to automate is a really good step in my career so I want to push myself to learn this. I think there might be a few concepts I&#x27;m missing that would make this &quot;click&quot; for me.

 Thank you for your time

We will remove the admin controls and enforce the number match experience tenant-wide for all users of Microsoft Authenticator push notifications starting May 8, 2023. We highly recommend enabling number matching in the near term for improved sign-in security. Relevant services will begin deploying these changes after May 8, 2023 and users will start to see number match in approval requests. As services deploy, some may see number match while others don&#x27;t. To ensure consistent behavior for all users, we highly recommend you enable number match for Microsoft Authenticator push notifications in advance.”
 The AAD Admin portal still shows Feb. 27th though.

                              <span>About 2 years ago the company went through a ransomware attack. At that time I used to be the local domain admin for my warehouse. The attack was traced to somebody&#x27;s remote account from the head office in New York so it had nothing to do with me or my territory.
 In fact, I warned them of suspicious login attempts to our local APC unit. They ignored it and what happened, happened.
 After that I had no business wanting to be involved with the IT department anymore. I requested that you guys handle everything from New York and just leave me out of it. That is technically what they did, but the IT head said we&#x27;re going to leave you a local admin account on your own PC just in case you need it for any reason. Okay I don&#x27;t care, do what you want was my response.
 Now they&#x27;re beefing up securit…</span>

                              <span>Looking for some advice. 
 Walked into an old environment and was asked to remove an old pki infrastructure. The environment consists of a root CA and a Sub CA. The root CA doesn&#x27;t exist anymore, the VM has been deleted a long time ago and no backup is available. Root certificate is still valid for a long time
 Most of the issued certificates we&#x27;ve already revoked. The only ones left now are certificates issued to the domain controllers via the domain controller template. 
 What would be the cleanest way to remove AD CS since the root CA doesn&#x27;t exist anymore and more important what would be the impact on the domain controllers if we revoke those certificates or remove AD CS.

                              <span>Whoever designed the alerts interface at APC must really hate their boss or coworkers. The way they have it configured to make edits is absolutely horrible.
 I&#x27;m getting an alert for UPS: Bypass not in range : either frequency or voltage.
 The hex code is 0x020F
 First off, let me search by hex code and or alert name.
 Fine, I&#x27;ll click on the Bypass events. Nope, not in there. Ok, where else could it be? Not sure, let me back to the main page and click through every event category.
 Is there a way to see all events and I can just ctrl + f to search for the one I need?
 I am remote to this site and the alerts are being sent every 2 min.
 In about 5 minutes I&#x27;ll be logging into the switch and disabling the port that the APC plugs in to or just disable the email server notifications on the APC until power is restored.
 Thanks.

 WARNING - DO NOT BUY SYSTEMS WITH THIS SSD INSIDE
 ​
 Right now we have 12 of these SSD&#x27;s in place, they all have a MFG date sticker of 2019-2020 or newer
 ​
 7 OF 12 HAVE FAILED - These systems were not one bulk order, they came in different desktop and laptop models bought over the course of several months.

 AVOID THIS SSD AT ALL COSTS

                              <span>I&#x27;m after a bit of clarification if I understand the sharepoint migration process correct using the SP Migration tool in 365 Admin Centre. I have the agent installed on my fileserver and can run the migration task fine and it works no issues.
 I plan to do the main migration over the weekend, then test it for a few days before doing an incremental migration of any other files changed or added over them few days. 
 In the new SP 365 migration bit how do I do incremental migration?
 Is it a case of running the same migration tasks again and it will just pickup changes, or do I need to set the &quot;migrate files modified / created&quot; setting in the task settings??

 I’m a team leader with 6 reports for a 24-7 international data centre operation.
 I look after a vital platform, from hardware up to the OS and app.
 It’s very stressful and needs 24/7 support, I’m on call myself also.
 At times the stress feels unsustainable and infrastructure is always a thankless task.
 There are upcoming political changes I don’t like the sound of.
 Has anyone moved out of this kind of position into a more peaceful roll?
 I’m paid fairly well (UK) but would take a pay cut for an easier life

                              <span>Hello fellow sysadmins. 
 We’ve encountered a tricky situation at one of our customers and are out if ideas. The problem is the following: 
 We got Azure ADDS setup and a AVD server in the environment.
 Each day the users have to sing in to Office, Teams, Onedrive and so on which gets a bit frustrating. Since the server is just AzureAD joined and we have no way to issue hybrid functionality for SSO through an ADDS-server the users get no primary refresh token for SSO after Windows sign in.
 We’ve been investigating how we can overcome this with no luck other then installing an ADDS-server to setup Hybrid join on to hybrid join the AVD-server. We see this as an absolute last resort and would like to make this work with the current setup. 
 Have any of you encountered this issue? Any ideas how to proceed with the current setup or are we out of luck?

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m trying to find some information about the upcoming release of the new Windows LAPS, specifically if this will be included natively into Windows 10 machines or only Windows 11 and beyond.
 On the MS overview page, they state:
 &quot;Windows LAPS is supported on desktop Windows, Windows Server, and Windows Server Core. Windows LAPS is a native Windows feature on all supported SKUs. No extra steps are required to install the feature.
 As noted earlier, Windows LAPS currently is available only in Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 25145 and later.&quot;
 Does anyone know if Windows 10 will see this, or would this just be a MS incentive to push companies towards migrating to Windows 11?

                              <span>Currently, we are looking at refitting some of our meeting rooms. Our original set up was completed on a bit of a budget and with zero time, we have an Intel NUC mounted behind a TV with a standard Windows 10 install. We then run a Jabra speaker/mic device under the floor that pops out on top of the desk. We also have a webcam mounted ontop of the TV. 
 Joining a meeting is super simple, you enter a pin to unlock the PC, Teams is set to auto open to the calendar upon login and you just click Join on your meeting. Its basically just a standard PC plugged into a TV with an external mic/speaker and webcam.
 We are being asked to look at some teams meeting rooms, which personally I dont think is necessary because the meeting rooms themselves work fine. We are just looking to splash some cash since we have some left over come tax time.
 My main concern is, during meetings no one wants to use their work laptop to share their screen in big presentations. They just put their powerpoint on a network share and run it off the NUC, but they still like to use their personal machines to share their just for quick bits and peices like &lt;4 quick catchups. If this even possible with a Teams meeting using something like a logitech tap? Or do you HAVE to share your screen using your personal machine?

                              <span>Hey all,
 I’m currently looking into implementing an identity platform for students K-12. I’ve received a few demos but need the truth and your best opinion.
 As of right now we use AD for our abundance of IT resources. Our only purpose of using an identity platform would be for the students, ideally.

 I&#x27;m in the process of looking for colocation or dedicated server services in Equinix NY4 or NY5 datacenters for my business. I&#x27;m hoping to get some recommendations from the community on which companies offer these services and at what costs.
 If you have any experience with colocation or dedicated server services in NY4 or NY5 datacenters, please let me know which companies you would recommend and why. It would be great if you could also share some details on pricing, such as monthly costs and any additional fees.
 Any help or insights would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Has anybody ever ran into the problem that Outlook (the new client) doesn&#x27;t want to display HTML-Newsletters correctly? It&#x27;s across all our computers (Macbook Air). The &quot;old Outlook&quot; can display them correctly as well as Office 360. I feel like it&#x27;s an update which broke it all - but I couldn&#x27;t find any official bug repots on this.
 Anybody else who had this problem?

We rely on a few servers as host for VM&#x27;s and EMC unity arrays. It works for us the only thing we do cloud is wasabi for offsite backup and 0365 for email, SharePoint,one drive. 
 Long and short i had a discuss with a buddy of mine who works for a much bigger company and thinks were crazy that everything isnt in azure or aws. The cost is just to much for us.

 Whats your cloud status ? Just wondering.

 Maybe its time you guys start pushing back on pure marketing ploys when buying stuff. They have gotten away with this shit long enough.

                              <span>Hello Everyone,
 I&#x27;m working for small-medium company that have had it&#x27;s IT processes really messed up before we came and implemented Azure AD, Intune, Office365 etc. Asset management in the past was just an excel spreadsheet that is not accurate anymore. This company has offices in different countries but, ultimately, the main one is in UK. What finance needs is to have a direct link between the invoice that came with the laptop or monitor for example, who has it assigned now and ultimately, they want to have to option to see the cost in GBP even if the laptop was bought in Morocco for example, using MAD as a currency. Depreciation in the app is also a must have
 ​
 Is there any web app that can do asset management with regards to this specific financial details? I was looking at BlueTally but i don&#x27;t know if it can have multiple currencies or something like that.
 ​
 Any info would be much appreciated.

                              <span>Was having trouble with a Laserjet printer (smearing on left side of the page). I think it might be the imaging drum but it still shows as 60% and I dont want to spend a ton of money without making sure what the issue is. Checked the warranty on HP&#x27;s site, still good. To get the support phone number, the page says I have to signup (red flag #1), so I ignored that, and found the number somewhere else.
 Called the local line, got the song and typical excuse that &quot;We are experiencing long queue yada yada&quot;. After picking the printers department and waiting for a while the phone system said &quot;We have a faster moving line, if you speak english, press x&quot;. Since English is not a problem, I went there.
 A lady picks up, listens to my problem and says she can&#x27;t help because they don&#x27;t deal with printers (red flag #2). Wants to give me a long phone number (unrecognizable to me) and refuses to say which country it belongs to, so how can I use it? (red flag #3)
 Realizing she has no idea where I&#x27;m calling from, I explain how I reached there, including the fact that I speak 2 languages, to which she says &quot;Wow, you&#x27;re so talented!&quot;. This is the part that I&#x27;m still laughing about.
 The whole conversation was weird, little bit condescending and silly. To me this is all kind of hilarious because I didn&#x27;t expect anything better than this when calling HP 😂

                              <span>We are noticing issues with Microsoft services on our network. I tend to notice it most when trying to sign into services using Azure sso. Sometimes it just hangs for a long time loading the page or after entering credentials. I have even seen it hang indefinitely or just timeout. Intune/Azure/365/company portal are also slow or just never loads. Most of the time if I just refresh the page it works fine the second time.
 I have seen this issue happening many different phones and computers so I know it isn&#x27;t anything device related.
 Is anyone else noticing this? I have been noticing the issue for months and it isn&#x27;t going away. Some days are better than others, but it happens pretty much every day.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I have someone in my company with that problem : No process is displayed in the task manager.
 ​
 - It is possible to open the task manager
 - The &quot;show more details&quot; bottom left is enabled
 - All other sections (performance, startup, details etc.) are working correctly
 - The startup folders in ProgramData/User session folder are created
 - /sfc scannow didn&#x27;t change anything
 - When I connect with my own session, the processes are showing, so it&#x27;s definitely from the user session... 
 ​
 Any other ideas ? My final solution is to delete the user&#x27;s session and to let him create it again but he has a lot of favorites, shortcuts so this is more annoying... 
 ​
 Thanks ! :)

                              <span>Hi everybody,
 I can&#x27;t figure out why some signed official binaries downloaded from internet are blocked by SmartScreen (with no possibility to force approval). For example,
 - if i download &quot;ConEmu&quot; from the official website, the binary has a valid certificate chain where the root CA is in the trusted roots of the computer. This prompts the Smartscreen. If i &quot;unblock&quot; the file from properties i can run it.
 - i download &quot;notepad++&quot; from the official website as well, valid certificate chain with trusted root. This doesn&#x27;t prompt smartscreen, directly UAC...
 Can someone explain this behavior ? I could see that the trigger of smartscreen is the &quot;zone identifier&quot; of the executable, but as told in the example, both of these were downloaded from the internet... 
 Also, how can i check the zone identifier of an executable?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Dear Community, since we get more and more home office devices, which only need to have a vpn client and connect over rds, we decided to not join these devices into our domain, since they are only used from outside our network. At first i checked them frequently manually, there are too much devices for this.
 Now i am searching for a small software, i would love to have a portal to see which devices are out of date. Priority is for windows updates and upgrades, third party software would be a bonus.
 Do you have any suggestions for me? The devices just have a connection to 4 terminal server, so the communication needs to be done over the normal internet.
 Im excited to hear about your opinions.

                              <span>Hey, I have a situation which cant figure out how to deal with it. Basicly there is a running yaml config of application and it can be modified from an API directly plus it can be configured through helm with templating. So at the deploy/upgrade of helm we have one running yaml config and yaml config from helm which may have additions and chanages to existing config. What is the best way do dynamically merge two giving precedence to running config? main point is being generic/dynamic but not going over each possible config array.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a 24 year old working as the lone IT guy for a huge organization. I&#x27;ve busted my ass to please everyone for five years. The teams message notification sound rings a billion times a day and my personal phone is being called by random employees who somehow has my number. Even when i have lunch, i lock my office door yet people are trying to rip off the handle it seems like to get inside. 
 Right now i have 4 huge problems i&#x27;m trying to fix at once because they&#x27;re all urgent last call things they need by the end of the week. One with fiber infrastructure, one with a cisco switch being unstable, one with Vmware and one with a WDS Server. They&#x27;re all problems that requires a somewhat lenghty amount of troubleshooting and configuration. 
 I&#x27;m trying my best but these people constantly send me passive aggressive messages asking when it&#x27;s done and why it&#x27;s not working. I&#x27;m trying my fucking best and i just want to scream. I&#x27;m currently so fucking overloaded by anxiety i just shut down and i&#x27;m now in the server room to just get a moment of peace. I still feel my phone vibrate and my heart jumps everytime it does. 
 Please remove this if it&#x27;s not within the rules to post, but i just needed someone to vent to. I have a job interview next week and that job has ZERO user support. So i hope i can get away from this shithole ASAP.

                              <span>I manage about 250 retail stores and use the following products:
  
PRTG - For monitoring WAN uptime, typical Windows sensors, etc.
 Cradlepoint - For LTE backup Internet 
 Rubrik - Data protection of Azure and M365 workloads
 Proofpoint - Email security
 Intune - MDM for corporate devices
 Microsoft Defender - EDR
 Zendesk - Ticketing
 ForitManager/Analyser - Central manage of Fortigate stacks of each location
  
All of these products provide API&#x27;s that I should be able to grab data from and display on a dashboard.
 My goal is to create PowerBI Dashboards for the data points I want to display from the list of products above. I want to be able to visual these dashboards from my mobile via the PowerBi app as well as setting up wallboards in our IT area of the office.
 Is this realistically achievable, all from PowerBI? My issue is that I have never successfully been able to display a single piece of data via a API. I have tried, but always fail.
 Are there other that have similar IT dashboards setups as I described?

 Are you (O365 Admins) use AU from long back or use any other tools to overcome the situation to delegate resources to multiple admins. Is there any other better approach to delegate role to other users?

                              <span>Hello,
 I am trying to make a decision based on the fact that i am so over tech support right now
 I am currently a junior sysadmin with experience in PowerShell scripting and very basic programming knowledge in website development. Lately, I have been contemplating a career move to become a software developer. I am looking for advice on whether this move is worth it and what skills or experience I should have to make it happen.
 I have enjoyed my time as a sysadmin, but I am looking for a career that is more fulfilling and flexible. My main goal is to start a business one day as soon as possible, and I am wondering which career path will be more advantageous in this regard. I am starting to enjoy building things, and I am concerned that being a sysadmin will mostly be a tech support role until I get into management. I also can&#x27;t see how any sysadmin skills will help in business/side hustles until it gets bit enough to need storage and automation. Whereas i feel like building small apps and implementations is possible to do on the side at least if i was to understand development
 I was considering doing a 6 – 10 month bootcamp to help transition, but am also considering other options. What are the key differences between being a sysadmin and a software developer? And most importantly, which career path will be more beneficial for starting a business or work for myself in the future, sysadmin/devops route or software development?
 Lastly, holding me back from making this move is that I have recently landed a role as a lone systems admin and have okay money now (90k AUD) and am enjoying 20% of the work (building/scripting things) and the title. Does it get much better? I am worried about losing the stability and the title of my current role, but I also know that sys admin skills aren’t really transferable to many starting out businesses and side hustles.
 I appreciate any advice or insight. Thank you!

                              <span>Here are the facts of the situation:
  
We are an MSP with a central office that has a backup appliance.
 
Our customers&#x27; servers send data backups to this appliance daily. 
 
Our office and all customers have static IP public IPv4 addresses.
 
Data comes in on TCP 35116 and 35117 which is port forwarded to our backup appliance (see below before you gasp :)
 
 Here is what we do to secure this
  
The office firewall drops all inbound traffic on 35116 and 35117 (actually all ports) unless it is coming from a customer IP address. We maintain an alias in our firewall for customer IP addresses
 
Backup files are encrypted with a 2048bit key as they are generated at the customer site. They cannot be read without this key
 
The connection itself is TLS from the customer server to the backup appliance
 
The backup client at the customer sites must have a seperate 2048bit key in order to connect and have Read/Write access to the backup appliance
 
The backup appliance is off domain and uses a separate set of credentials from anything else
 
  
Here is the debate.
 A coworker is pretty insistent that we should be running these connections over a VPN of some sort. Either OpenVPN, WireGuard, or IPSec maybe. I have countered that since the backups themselves are encrypted AND are being sent over TLS, this is not necessary and would harm performance.
 What do you think? Is adding a site-to-site VPN (with appropriate firewall rules and controls) to this setup worthwhile?

                              <span>Perhaps someone has seen this before, when I enable the following on the switch stack consisting of two Cisco 9300s, the second switch cannot handle the config sync and reboots itself, showing the error in the log that this is causing the sync issue.
 archive
 path flash:archives/$h
 maximum 14
 write-memory
 I assume this is due to the path, can the standby switch write to flash? or can it not handle the $h variable? I want to set up local config change logging and backups at the very least, because the network team for this org has let it all go to hell, and now I have to fix everything and do it myself, hell they didn&#x27;t even set up SNMP properly, all the network devices are using RADIUS servers half way around the world away when we have some locally... just a mess.
 Any advise on maybe setting up better management of the local devices is welcome as well, maybe there is an open source solution I can run locally to at least manage the configs?

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been in the field for a while now and I&#x27;m shifting from networking more into security.
 I&#x27;ve been working with FTDs as well as Checkpoints and Palos for a few years and everywhere I look (especially this sub lol), I can see frequent jokes about the FTD platform.
 I mean, I kinda get it, the platform didn&#x27;t start out well and was a hot mess until recently when they managed to catch up a bit in my eyes. But when I read the discussions, it seems to me that everybody thinks it&#x27;s a completely wasteful investment to any deployment.
 So what do you guys think? Is it still that bad as everyone says?

                              <span>I&#x27;m wondering if anybody has any real world experience with this combination of devices. We&#x27;re in the process of upgrading from our old 5508 controllers (and 2700/2800 series APs) to a pair of 9800-L WLCs with 9115 APs. Nothing new is in production yet, we&#x27;re still in the planning phase, and we&#x27;re trying to figure out how difficult this will be (we&#x27;re in a manufacturing environment where some sites work 3 shifts and almost never shut down).
 According to this compatibility matrix, it should work. Here&#x27;s a screenshot of the relevant section.
 I&#x27;ve got one of the 9800s online and I&#x27;ve got a spare 2702 AP that I&#x27;m testing with. I&#x27;ve installed 17.3.4c to the WLC installed the specific AP firmware from the table but so far I haven&#x27;t been able to get them to talk. This very well could be user error so far since I&#x27;m not that familiar with this thing yet.
 I&#x27;m just wondering if anybody can confirm these work together. This would be much easier if we could just swap out the controllers with the existing APs in place and then swap out the APs one by one (we&#x27;ve got the controllers but the APs aren&#x27;t due to ship for several months yet). Otherwise this will get convoluted quickly.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been facing an issue on a new box where I seem to be unable to communicate with interfaces that are in a management vrf. I haven&#x27;t run into this on any other device so I&#x27;m a bit confused. From what I can tell everything appears like it should work, but I can&#x27;t get the networks connected to &quot;CORE-DEVICE&quot; to talk to Loopback1 on &quot;DEVICE-A&quot;. Any help or insight would be greatly appreciated. I&#x27;ve been tinkering with this for too long and am lacking ideas.
  
The interface I&#x27;m trying to access is a loopback interface - 10.10.1.50.
 I&#x27;m using OSPF to sync ldp. 
 I see the correct routes and next hop at both ends. 
 I am using two route reflectors. 
 A traceroute from the primary device(CORE-DEVICE)/location is successful to the first PE(10.10.253.2/10.32.0.0) - then fails after that.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been fighting with this for a few days and am wondering if anyone else has a Dell N3048P using TACACS to hit Clearpass. I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything searching around on forums or on Aruba/Dell support pages. I believe the issue is with my Dell&#x27;s AAA configuration. I&#x27;ve tried several variations but nothing has seemed to get past CPPM to hit the Access Tracker. I have services built out for Cisco, Aruba, and Brocade with no issues. 
 CPPM is showing a &quot;warn&quot; in the event viewer for a failed TacacsServer request. &quot;Authorization request for unauthenticated user &#x3D; blahblahblah&quot;. The device is added to CPPM and a device group. I changed the secret in CPPM and then started receiving an error about the secret having a mismatch so that isn&#x27;t an issue.
 Dell AAA config:
 aaa authentication login &quot;defaultList&quot; enable local tacacs
 aaa authentication login &quot;tacacs&quot; enable local tacacs
 aaa accounting commands &quot;dfltCmdList&quot; start-stop tacacs
 aaa accounting commands &quot;1&quot; start-stop tacacs
 aaa accounting commands &quot;15&quot; start-stop tacacs
 aaa authorization exec &quot;dfltExecAuthList&quot; local tacacs
 ​
 I&#x27;m mainly curious if anyone has this setup on their network and might have an easy answer for me. I&#x27;m about to call Aruba TAC but I doubt they are going to do anything since the issue seems to be with Dell which we no longer have support on.

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 I&#x27;m currently trying to figure out my best path forwards with a Firewall migration.
 Diagram
 (Default routes marked by arrows)
 At present no dynamic routing is in use (yes I know). The Legacy Firewall has routes back to the Legacy L3, the Legacy L3 has routes back to the new L3.
 The intent was to use PBR on the new L3 so that subnets could be moved from using the Legacy L3 as their default gateway one at a time, so that the associated VIPs and rules on the Legacy Firewall could be moved individually rather than in one large cut-over migration. (There&#x27;s a lot of legacy mess and shared VIPs with static NATs that need to be cleaned up as part of the process)
 Now ideally I would like to simply use PBR to override the default gateway and continue to use the routing table for all …</span>

 Long story short, I&#x27;m distributing routes with a peer from another company but I&#x27;m unable to use AS paths to reliably determine upstream route preferences. The only way I&#x27;ve found is to subnet sizes to determine the preferred path, but I&#x27;m currently limited to advertising /31 routes that peer. Since the other company is massive, it takes a lot of effort and paperwork for them to make changes, I&#x27;d rather do this on our end if possible.
 Is there a way for my router to receive a /30 route from my network but ONLY distribute it as a /31?

 how much down time it can occur if I change a default route from one gateway to another?
 Example below.
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.10.1.1
 to 
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.20.1.1

                              <span>Hi,
 Not sure if this exists yet, but can we create an International BGP community standard or something along those lines for advertising your prefixes so we know what Country/State/Province/Region/etc your prefixes are located?
 We operate a latency sensitive network and have to constantly filter certain prefixes from being learnt via certain AS&#x27; so they have optimal routing and it is a tedious task. 
 This is where I had the idea that surely there had to be a better way and the first thing that came to my head is BGP communities that will identify the Country/State/Province/Region/etc. For example, an ASN with the 123.123.123.0/24 prefix in Japan Hokkaido Region can have a BGP community of 11:1 announced with their prefix. 11 being the Country (Japan) and 1 being the Hokkaido Region. (Side note: I really hope we end up giving Japan 11 as their BGP community code as a *tips fedora* to Code Geass).
 I&#x27;ll admit this is not fully thought through yet and I wanted to open up the discussion to the networking community to hear their thoughts. The first issue I can forsee is AS&#x27; that strip BGP communities. In my head this International BGP community standard would be most useful in IXs.
 TLDR; If you operate an ASN can you advertise your prefixes with a BGP community that will identify the Country:/State/Province/Region/etc? An International BGP community codes standard for the BGP communities would be great.

                              <span>I want to create a captive portal with different restriction per user account/role (student and teacher). 
  
The Teacher can have unrestricted access.
 The Student have restricted access. (only defined/allowed websites are accessible).
  
But upon my research/review on OpnSense Captive Portal Documentation, This is not possible because you can only configure firewall/captive portal settings per port/interface. In short, 1 Zone is 1 Interface.
 I cannot modify the infrastructure/wiring or add another Wi-Fi access points since It&#x27;s already installed and running. I can only configure them.
 So my plan is: 
  
Setup 2 VLAN ID&#x27;s (Interface) on a single physical ethernet port on OpnSense that is connected to the Wifi Access Points.
 Create two Captive Portals on OpnSense that uses the 2 VLAN Interface I created.
 Configure the Wifi Access Points to two SSID&#x27;s (Teacher Wifi &amp; Student WiFi) and attach each SSID to specific VLAN ID I setup on OpnSense.
 Configure OpnSense Website Filtering on the Student Wifi VLAN Interface.
  
To be honest, these are just my theories. I don&#x27;t really know if this is a feasible or good workaround/setup. This is my first time in network setup/engineering. Please bear with me.
 All I want to know is, Is this kind of setup possible Please give me some tips/suggestions on how I can do it better. Thank you very much!

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m currently handling ASA 2120. I was able to access the asdm via default route 192.168.45.1 but I changed the firewall mode to transparent and a lot of configurations were lost. I changed my firewall mode back to routed and reconfigured all the missing files but I cannot access the asdm anymore. I tried configuring the management 1/1 but no luck. 
 What happens when you change the firewall mode?

 I’m going with Python scripting (the possibilities are endless and extend way beyond sysadmin work), Azure (less specific and for unsurprising reasons), and the ability to fix any printer issue in 15 minutes or less (or maybe just to convince people that they don’t really need a printer anymore?).

 Installing the latest Security Updates for SQL via SCCM, noticed they were also install the latest CU as part of it.
 The SU&#x27;s look to be set to supersede the actual CU within SCCM. 
 First time I have seen it done this way... and just a heads up for others

                              <span>In Star Wars Episode IV, A New Hope, R2D2 can be seen plugging in to download additional plans to the Death Star. One sees R2D2 in the screen for approximately 80 seconds before we see him again in frame, disconnected from the terminal. I contend R2D2’s dongle is capable of yottabit speed.
 The hard drive used to store the plans allegedly held 512 million exanodes of space, as depicted in Star Wars Rogue One. This would therefore be 512 yotta nodes if one follows the metric naming convention for numerical prefixes.
 General (poor) assumptions: (1) R2D2 spent all 80 seconds downloading the plans to the Death Star (2) the plans to the Death Star and its build history downloaded filled up the drive (3) a bit is equivalent to a node (4) no q-bit fuckery is afoot and (5) the plans are uncompressed.
 512/80 is 6.4 yottabit/second throughput.

I used PDQ in past but having so many users remote and being agent-less it&#x27;s not working half of the time. How you go about 3rd party updates, or even Windows updates. Thanks

                              <span>Within the last couple of days I had setup a DFS Namespace on a domain controller and DFS Replication to replicate a shared folder from one file server to another. During the course of that initial replication copy, there was a root folder on the same drive where the shared folder was being replicated to and that root folder is now gone. Backups were not in production at the time as the server was still being configured. Replication only went one direction (Old Server to New Server) for one folder and its sub folders (IE D:\SharedFolder\FolderShares1-6 and User Redirected Folders). this was done as a form of migration of the file servers. 
 Now that the folder is gone, I am wondering why would DFS remove that folder if it was not part of the replication. I am also now running into issues where users are denied access to their User Redirected Folders, which still reside on the old File server and are managed via GPO.

                              <span>I work at a retirement facility. I got off a call today with our ISP (A very well known massive cable/internet/phone provider, but not comcast) where they casually mentioned (after we threatened to go in house) that we must use their managed Wi-Fi MDU solution, they wont just give us an internet pipe for us to do it in-house. 
 They said the Business or Enterprise divisions will not give us a connection for residential use and if they see that we&#x27;re trying to use it for our residents they will cut us off.
 There&#x27;s literally no other ISP that services the area except for T1 DSL or Starlink business. 
 Does this make any sense? They&#x27;re essentially forcing us to use their managed service which we hate and want to get rid of. 
 How can this be legal? What about all those news stories of some people in neighborhoods becoming their own ISP by buying a business class modem and then re-selling it with some kind of mesh system to the neighbors?

                              <span>I took over as the head of IT and part of the role is vendor management, which includes the MSP currently being leveraged for support and professional services. In fairness they’re the second MSP and took over last year from another MSP.
 There’s been a few red flags (100s of dormant AD accounts, Azure servers running but not used for anything, etc) all minor things I could chalk up to unintentional or old MSP shenanigans. One frustration mentioned when I started is the migration from the previous MSP is only now being wrapped up by the new MSP, a year later. All these things I again can chalk up to scheduling, waiting for resources, etc. 
 What I do need a sanity check on is the slowness of response for requests of 1) documentation and network diagrams, 2) quotes for new projects, and 3) a lack of interest in consolidating/disabling portions of Azure infrastructure.
 For example, I requested a rough estimate for five projects 8 business days ago. By no means detailed SoWs, just a rough number for budget setting. Or waited nearly three weeks for documentation and still no response beyond confirmation of receipt.
 Is this type of non-responsiveness expected? What is considered a quick turn-around for these types of requests? Feel like I’m going crazy.

                              <span>Greetings fellow sysadmins,
 Our organization relies heavily on Microsoft Word VBA Macros to generate and live-edit Word documents. They were hand-made about 15 years ago, and the original authors are gone. Our sysadmins can maintain with minor edits as needed, but aren&#x27;t really tasked for making new, complex workflows should the need arise.
 In googling, I found that Microsoft released &quot;Office Scripts&quot; in 2020. By &quot;Office Scripts&quot;, Microsoft really meant, &quot;Excel Online Scripts&quot;. Have not seen any indication of scripting being extended into Word.
 Is there any successor, alternative, or replacement to Word VBA Macros? Seems kind of weird for a technology from 1993 to have no replacement 30 years later.
 Thanks for any insight you may have.

My admin is gung-ho about physically moving drops from punch to punch when certain people move to a different desk within the one building in the company, and re-punching is uncomfortable to say the least, painful normally.
 So my question is it normal to move drops to different panels so that they can be plugged into another switch? This happens a fair amount (including, &quot;condensing the drop&quot;) and I thought to ask.
 Thanks!

I appreciate the aesthetic value of darker slides, but am concerned that excessive use would cause my audience to grow disinterested or have a negative impression of the topic being discussed.
 Which is why I chose to initiate this thread in the first place.
 What kind of tactics, approaches, hacks, etc. do you employ with your slides/presentations to irk out that much greater of a reception/response to you? whether executive or not. I had someone recommend to me HighNote.io, has anyone ever used the tool before ?
 Friends, shall we share once more?

                              <span>I recently took over running a medical facility. The clinic and providers are great but every other part of the business is set up terribly. I&#x27;ve been going through it piece by piece working on fixing it. Trust me when I say my predecessor was a complete moron.
 My most recent discovery is that we are paying $865 a month (before taxes and fees) for our copy machine (only one) that only sees moderate use. It took me days and about a dozen calls and I finally got ahold of my account rep and the explanation is my predecessor continued to roll over their lease agreement about 2 years early over and over and we have been with them for 30 years so the previous amount due was also rolled over.
 The summary is that we pay almost 1,000 a month for the next 63 months (the contract was signed only a few months ago). To break it we would have to pay over $55,000 for a copier machine that would cost about $8,000 to buy.
 ​
 If anyone has any advice or experience with this kind of situation any input would help. 
 Again reminder I did not sign this contract!! This is just one of many insane contracts signed here by my moronic predecessor. I always read the fine print.

 I know I can just click to use my default browser and move on with my life, but I can’t help but wonder the confusion this will cause people who now think they have to download a new app/browser in order to view a link.

 Random Password Generator (Maybe not a very well known tool, but recommend it)
 Putty
 Notepad++
 7zip
 Curious to see what others have to share.

                              <span>So one of our site has a down apc. We literally have hundreds of the replacement battery on back order and spend months replacing them because we don’t know when they will die. We have a lot of apc units but someone decided it’s not worth getting the monitoring card. So sites will go down for a day or two till the tech goes out to replace the battery. The funny thing that one tech said was 
 “They are suppose to check it monthly”
 Mind you these are office worker with high turn over. They either don’t know what to look for or did not receive proper training. Unless the apc panel changed, I don’t think it show the condition of the battery. No one knows when it’ll die. How is visually checking the panel any indication of when the battery needs to be replace

                              <span>I&#x27;ll keep it short. We have a (bad) vendor who was very late in providing Edge support. For that reason we have held off on disabling IE. Lots of testing has been done and we believed we were ready for the disabling of IE yesterday. 
 Only... it does not appear to have happened? We have applied the latest Windows security and Edge updates but IE still works. We are not running one of the unaffected versions of Windows 10. 22H2 on the Feb 14 builds with latest Edge updates can still launch IE. 
 Anyone else seeing this? I am just trying to ensure we didn&#x27;t miss something here.

                              <span>Has anyone else experienced odd login issues in various MS365 Office apps since Monday?
 We&#x27;ve had Outlook being stuck in an infinite login attempt loop until restarted (sometimes it needs two restarts), OneNote not synchronizing Notebooks and not accepting new login attempts as well as OneDrive and even my own Win11 machine requiring a new authentication after a reboot (but those just validate automatically with no password prompts, they just have to be started manually by clicking the &quot;login again&quot; prompt). But not everyone is affected and they are rarely the same issues across users.
 Just wondering if it&#x27;s just our org or if MS has changed anything behind the scenes without checking if their apps still work afterwards (again...)

 are any of you guys running terminal server solutions? what are you doing about this?
 are we forced to migrate to DAAS solutions or are there any good on prem solutions for this?

                              <span>Hello there,
 I would like to setting up the SSSO to my organization but I don&#x27;t know if it secure enough. I have an hybrid environment but without Azure AD-joined devices, my devices only joined to the on-premise AD. I followed the Microsoft documentation and I configured everything: Azure AD Connect, GPO and the Firewall. It is working very well with my test users. 
 My settings in a nutshell:
 Azure AD
  
Password hash sync
  
GPO (from Microsoft documentation)
  
Site to Zone Assignment List
 Allow updates to status bar via script
 SPNEGO (Firefox)
  
AZUREADSSO Computer Object on my on-premise AD
  
Storing object in OU where is securing against accidental deletion
 msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes attribute set to AES-256-CTS-HMAC-SHA1-96
 Kerberos delegation is disabled on this object 
  
According to Microsoft documentation it is recommended to update the Kerberos decryption key at least on every 30 day.
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-sso-faq#how-can-i-roll-over-the-kerberos-decryption-key-of-the--azureadsso--computer-account-
 I have not found anything about SSSO on the internet from a security perspective. Can cybercriminals exploit this SSSO capability or is it safe enough? I am wondering about on this because SSSO sends Kerberos ticket over the internet. I don&#x27;t know if I should worry about that. Maybe I just overthinking.
 Does anyone have experience with Seamless Single Sign-On? Can you share your experience with me?
 Is there anything else I should be aware of?

                              <span>Hi r/sysadmin
 I&#x27;m curious how you all go about testing your backups? We have a medium/large sized environment with ~1000 VMs and a few physical servers (most SQL boxes) that we are backing up regularly. 98% Windows, a very select few Linux. However, we don&#x27;t have a definitive process for testing these backups beyond requested restores that we have to do as people need them.
 Previously, I used Veeam&#x27;s SureBackup feature to test backups at my previous job, but here we use Commvault and I don&#x27;t see a similar feature. There does seem to be some sort of backup validation but Commvault&#x27;s documentation doesn&#x27;t match what I&#x27;m seeing in our console.
 Using Veeam&#x27;s SureBackup as a model, I started to build out a sandbox network that would mirror our production network, which I could restore VMs into and then run scripts against them to verify they are working. The point I&#x27;m more or less stuck at is the &quot;scripts to verify they are working&quot; part. For basic Windows boxes I&#x27;ve got a script that checks for running services, and for all the VMs I&#x27;m pulling their reported heartbeat status by VMWare, but this is imperfect and doesn&#x27;t cover some of our more specialized boxes like Exchange or SQL databases. 
 Somewhere along the line I think there will be a human element (IE, you are the admin for this server, your server is currently in the sandbox network, login to it and make sure everything works before it gets torn down) but I&#x27;d like to automate as much of this process as possible.
 What approach do you take? Is there a feature in Commvault I&#x27;ve missed or a third party tool that solves the problem? Or do you have better ideas on what to check using various scripts and the like?

                              <span>EDIT: title is missing &quot; of folders&quot; in the end..
 Hi,
 I need to add an AD group to the ACL of thousands of folders, which all have different permissions and inheritance settings. All the folders are subfolders of drive D
 I need all the permissions to stay the same, just one group added with full access. I wrote a powershell script for this. 
 Is this the right approach? do you see anything wrong with this?
 $identity &#x3D; &#x27;domain\group&#x27; $rights &#x3D; &#x27;FullControl&#x27; $inheritance &#x3D; &#x27;ContainerInherit, ObjectInherit&#x27; $propagation &#x3D; &#x27;None&#x27; $type &#x3D; &#x27;Allow&#x27; $ACE &#x3D; New-Object System.Security.AccessControl.FileSystemAccessRule($identity, $rights, $inheritance, $propagation, $type) Get-ChildItem D: -Recurse -Directory | ForEach-Object{ $acl &#x3D; get-acl -Path $_.FullName $acl.AddAccessRule($ACE) Set-Acl -Path $_.FullName -AclObject $acl } 
 Thanks.

 Just did a couple of host upgrades to get ESXI up to the latest and greatest - 21053776
 Just installed the 14/02 Windows update and am getting Security Violation on boot of the two 2022 VMs I have. 
 Disabling SecureBoot does allow the VM to start, but there is something going on here....

                              <span>Hey all. 
 So I&#x27;ve been trying to think about my career in a 10-15 or maybe 15-20 year span. I know it&#x27;s a controversial idea, but I look at the developments in the space and satellite industry and can&#x27;t help but see this era as the verge of a massive breakout of space infrastructure. 
 So that got me thinking, what does an IT infrastructure look like to a space faring civilization when there are regular trips to a lunar colony? How would you deploy software to an MECM distribution point on the moon? How would you handle a Domain Controller in deep space?
 I&#x27;ve tried looking for early research on this idea without much success. Does anybody know of any reading material on the subject? Or possibly any writings on interfacing with a remote site that has unreliable or inconsistent communication times?

                              <span>Hi Guys, how do you go about designing and testing a DR plan when your core applications /services are in the cloud. Do you just explain in your DR plan that you are relying on the SAAS vendor DR plan or should we realistically have a plan if for example if google workspace was to go down? 
 The reason we go with SAAS providers is they will have 1000 times better DR than we could afford but I find we are being asked to provide a DR plan for our business and am finding it difficult to articulate this.

 So we have a hardware vpn in Colorado that has a s2s connection to azure. Usually when you are on prem and on the same network as your vpn, you should be able to access the same assets as if you connected to vpn remotely.
 It won’t let me connect to azure s2s and when trying to connect to vpn in Colorado from California.
 Is there a setting , I have to switch on and off to get access to tunnels from onsite. I feel like should be a very basic setting , and it should just let you always have access to azure subnets if your on prem

 My thinking is to remove the heart beat(HA) cables and then connect directly to the original master (on 7.2.2) and upgrade it to 7.2.4 thereafter start the boot sequence and get the firewalls back in order with HA cables. I have made no changes since last night.
 Call logged with Fortinet but they are taking forever to respond. Anyone run into a similar issue and can offer some advice?

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been thinking about this a lot lately (gods save us...): How do you stay motivated/focused and interested enough to keep your skills up to date and learn new skills? What&#x27;s your tricks?
 I&#x27;ve noticed as I&#x27;ve both gotten older and have been in this field of ours for damn near 25 years, absorbing new knowledge and learning new systems/skills that I haven&#x27;t worked with before is becoming more and more difficult. I struggle maintaining enough of a focus to keep at it, and also notice that my retention is pretty abysmal. Case in point, these days I&#x27;m trying to shove a lot of MS&#x27; Power Platform-skills into my head, since I&#x27;ll be working a lot on that due to a move to Dynamics 36 that we&#x27;re currently underway on.
 But I find it damn hard to actually do, even though I&#x27;m interested in what the Power Platform can do in terms of data management and automation.

                              <span>Hey,
 Kind of odd question but I hope someone can help me understand it.. as far as I know, IGEL reworked their license model recently and I&#x27;m not sure if it still works for our planned enviroment.
 We have around 10-15 Thin Clients, mostly in warehouses where it&#x27;s rather dirty and since we swapped out most office PCs in 2021, I have a bunchload of old systems that I want to rework into TCs to replace our current &quot;infrastructure&quot; which consists mostly of 7-10 year old actual thin clients with a self-&quot;constructed&quot; Linux version. Latter one wasn&#x27;t documented at all by it&#x27;s creator who hase left us in the meantime.
 So around the middle of 2022 I got 4 IGEL licenses to test and that worked pretty fine so far, we decided for the UDP / USB-Version and had no problems occur and the remote assistence etc. helped a lot. I had to put the topic aside for a while now due to other more urgend topics and since we lack staff right now. 
 I read somewhere that IGEL reworked their license modell and it&#x27;s no longer &quot;Buy once, get 1 year of support and that&#x27;s it. More support costs but you can use the thin client without support&quot;. Considering the rather dirty enviroment and that our current &quot;Solution&quot; produces no monthly/yearly cost (except a device fails after years of usage) I doubt that I&#x27;ll get the OK for a yearly subscription model.
 So could someone break down the new system or if I understood it wrong and my planned system/setup would still work?

                              <span>Hi there,
 a customer of ours has a CNC machine with a possible malware infection. The machine is completely offline and runs on Windows XP. They transfer NC files from a domain-joined PC to the machine with an USB stick.
 We recently got an AV alert from the PCs AV solution, because it found an infected Autorun.inf on the stick. I&#x27;ve re-formatted the stick, but the issue reoccured soon after, which implies that the CNC machine is infected.
 We&#x27;d like to scan the CNC machine, but so far haven&#x27;t found a virus scanner which fits our needs: 
  
Lightweight and portable
 Usable without internet connection (with up to date virus patterns)
 Compatible with XP
  
Does anyone know a fitting software?

 What is the suggestion for centrally managing and scheduling these scripts, yet still maintaining security due to the required elevated credentials?

 Started off in support but slowly became senior. Now im the only person in the company who can deploy, support, update the majority of our applications and services. And the only person who has access and knowledge to handle the hardware/azure it all sits on.
 Ive been pushing for fair pay for about 6 years but constantly been give the typical HR spoof (you&#x27;re not worth that much, we dont have spare funding, the company isnt in the right place... ect) 
 I handed my notice in today and im leaving them no documentation or training any replacement.

 ​
 I&#x27;m writing to you because I can&#x27;t figure out this odd behavior:
 We changed the IIS server&#x27;s timeout setting from 90 seconds to 250 seconds.
 The appliance is placed on the back of an Azure LB with a 240-second timeout.
 Since the change, we have observed numerous transation timeouts where none had previously been reported.
 When the previous settings have been restored, everything was back to normal.
 Do you know why this peculiar behavior is occurring?
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi sysadmins, I had quick question about logging on Windows servers. By default (i.e no SIEMs, no IDS, no firewall), how much info does a windows server log about any devices that connect to it? More specifically, is it possible for me to find which devices connected to it within a certain hour last week?
 Specifically the machine in question is a mail server running mdaemon. Someone sent an email from the organization&#x27;s account with stolen credentials. We are trying to find the IP (and any other info if possible) for whoever connected to it. If windows server logs the IPs of all incoming requests, then it should be trivial to cross reference those requests with timestamp on the email right?

                              <span>Im having weird issues with APC UPSes lately. We connect them via USB to our Servers (Windows Server with Hyper-V).
 PowerChute gives us the notification that the UPS connection is not established via our Monitoring. We have tried everything so far. Reinstalling the Software, Replugging the UPS (which sometimes works), Rebooting the OS and so on. Nothing really helps.
 ​
 I know the UPS is connected to the server. If I uninstall the APC UPS Driver, then the UPS gets detected by Windows and the battery symbol appears in the taskbar.
 ​
 Doesnt matter what Windows Server it is. The problem happens on any of our Servers. Randomly I would say. Its really frustrating because you cant seem to fix it remotely.I dont wanna go on site to check the UPSes myself. Not with 100 clients.
 ​
 Anyone else having that issue? Or maybe someone has found a fix?

                              <span>New to linux or sysadmin, and new to organizing myself and scripts and env. I am setting up aliases and bash functions for making my life easy at work. I plan to use git to save my work in a repo within a branch having a name &quot;common&quot; for common things and another branch with name of that of the company I am working for, and to which the laptop belongs, where I will save/commit company specific stuff.
 I see that I am spending a lot of my free time in customizing things. Shell variables, aliases, bash functions, writing scripts to help me login to different envs (Azure, AWS, local Servers etc) easily. Aliases to execute frequent long commands. Functions to execute commands with parameters.
 Wanted to understand, that since this is the beginning for me to customize my env for myself, is it Okay to spend a considerable amount of time in the process? I am hoping that my current way of customizing will help me in future companies also, where I can clone this repo, switch to an old companies branch, take what should be taken from common (probably all), and then create a new branch with the new company name and add that company specific stuff there.
 Will doing things this way, which would make things heavily customized in the future, and might need some maintainence overhead too, is a good idea? Or is there a better way?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m starting a new position as a CISO in a company where the IS is very complex... and partially unknown by the internal management team... (parts of the IS are externally managed)
 As I progress by interviews or self discovering, I&#x27;m looking for a tool where I could:.
  
create assets by type and tags (human, server, network, data, workflow, geographical plant, supplier ...)
 
bind them together
 
provide a visual representation for assets with dependencies and relations between them 
 
and for the GRC part, ability to add controls to some assets, based on applicable regulations (GDPR, for ex.). 
 
 Do you know some tool or combination of native tool with plugin which could achieve this ? 
 Thanks

                              <span>I have a remote site that is connected to my DC via a Juniper SRX firewall that&#x27;s establishing a site-to-site tunnel to another SRX in the DC. The remote site is on a cable internet circuit. At all my sites, including the remote site, 802.1X with EAP-TLS is used for both wireless and wired auth. This has been working great for months, until my ISP changed which backbone on their network my DIA connection runs across. No other changes were made anywhere other than the provider&#x27;s backbone that&#x27;s delivering the DIA circuit.
 The IP address of the SRX in the DC didn&#x27;t change and the tunnel is still up and working. I can&#x27;t find any evidence of issues with the tunnel, except .1X doesn&#x27;t work anymore. On the NPS servers in the DC, event viewer shows that auth requests are coming in from the switch and AP at the remote site, but it almost seems like the .1X requests are getting mangled across the site-to-site tunnel. The same NPS servers service .1X for hardwired and wireless clients across several other sites connected via the ISP&#x27;s MPLS without issue.
 Event viewer shows that auth requests from the AP at the remote site get logged as event id 6274 &quot;The RADIUS Request message that Network Policy Server received from the network access server was malformed.&quot; Auth requests from hardwired ports from the remote switch show that rather than the computer name with a certificate, the request shows the client trying to auth with its mac address as the username and PAP and summarily denied.
 A tech at the ISP that made the backbone change and I have been beating our heads against the wall for a few days now with no progress. I&#x27;ve resorted to installing wireshark on the NPS server to try to find differences between known-good auth packets and broken packets, but haven&#x27;t found an obvious difference yet. Would anyone happen to know how a seemingly innocuous change could bork .1X in such a bizarre way?

                              <span>I have set up the equipment stated in the title as a failover solution. it works, HOWEVER, it still has about a 30 second delay, and re-assigns me a new IP somewhere that im not smart enough to know about. For example, if i was on a video call, i would have a backup internet connection within 10-20 seconds, EXCEPT i would have to re-start the call. its not seamless.
 I&#x27;m not sure where the new IP is getting assigned and where to fix it. I found on google lots of stuff about setting up a &quot;floating IP address&quot; that would duplicate the information from the old IP and send it to the new address thats coming from the 4G LM1200.
 Any assistance? Thanks.

                              <span>We&#x27;re looking to get a 20G MPLS circuit for a site in Asia. Our preferred carrier can meet this requirement and the pricing is fine, but it was mentioned that their backbone serving this particular country is basically a heap of 10G links.
 We often have to send huge files internationally, which can easily saturate a 20G circuit. Should I be worried that the carrier&#x27;s backbone is Nx10G? Would something like traffic arriving out of order due to asymmetric routing be a potential issue?
 What kind of questions should I be asking them before we pull the trigger? I have full access to their network engineering team but I&#x27;m finding it hard to articulate my questions so that I don&#x27;t receive bullshit answers.

                              <span>Greetings,
 Does anyone happen to have old Nortel Optera manuals / management software hiding in their personal archives? 
 I have a network history lab that I am trying to bootstrap and I am needing to activate some Optera gear (5100 in particular).
 I worked with the Optera platforms in the early days but I cannot locate my PDFs or software archives for them.
 I know that Optera IP went to Ciena - but I had moved out of optical by that point - so I don&#x27;t have a relationship with them.
 I am hoping that being many years out of date - some of this would be available without too much fuss. 
 This is a completely non-commercial exercise - just trying to restore some items from my past as a hobby (I have the hardware, just no software/docs).
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello Im trying to config a Untangle firewall for using OpenVpn access internal server port 8081.
 When client connects using OpenVpn the OpenVpn conection says its reaching to the outside Untangle firewall IP with port 1194 without any errors. 
 Then when the client opens their application an error comes up with the IP:8081/Server which is the server,port,share that is open for that application.
 I dont know if this is correct but I made a Port Foward rule form OpenVpn port 1194 to forward to the internalIP:8081 (ServerApplication)
 Am I configuring this correctly or how do I go about it? Thank you!

                              <span>I cant seem to get this network configuration working.
 Two routers are on the same network. 
 (site to site VPN to another RV325) WAN &gt; RV325 &gt; (LAN 192.168.15.1) 
 (OpenVPN) WAN &gt; RV260 &gt; (LAN 192.168.15.2) 
 DHCP is disabled on both. Running a DHCP server on a 2016 DC.
 ​
 I just added 192.168.15.2 to the scope of the DHCP just now hoping that will fix it.
 ​
 When I log into the OpenVPN RV260, I can&#x27;t see anything on the network, why?
 The RV260 and RV325 are not compatible for site-to-site VPN, otherwise I would do it and remove the RV325 completely and this problem will go away. Howeverm I can&#x27;t do that, so there has to be a fix for this. 
 ​
 Why when I log into the OpenVPN server on the RV260, I can&#x27;t see any network devices? I can only ping devices with the Gateway of the router I am connected too. 
 ​
 This is bothering the crap out of me. 
 ​
 Please help.

 I am a developer, so I do not have much knowledge in networking or datacenters.
 My application requires multiple IP addresses, currently I rent some on premise servers, and using docker container my microservices work each one with their own IP address.
 I want to buy my own IP addresses so I don&#x27;t depend on the availability of my current provider, but I do not know where to start.
 - Do I need a local server?
 - Can I just purchase a pool of IP addresses and use them with any cloud provider?
 ​
 I would appreciate any help from you guys, hope you have a nice day

                              <span>Hello,
 ​
 Im hoping someone might be able to help me figure out an issue I am having configuring a Cisco switch.
 ​
 So, first, I am not Cisco certified and overall have very little experience configuring Cisco switches. 
 ​
 The issue that I am running into is kind of strange. I am not able to get to my firewall from one of my VLANS.
 ​
 My test environment is like this
 ​
 ​
 Switch 1 (core switch) 192.168.0.10
 Switch 2 (access switch) 192.168.0.11
 Switch 3 (access switch) 192.168.0.12
 Firewall 192.168.0.6
 ​
 PC1 192.168.0.100
 PC2 192.168.0.110
 PC3 192.168.3.110
 ​
 I can ping everything from both PC1, PC2 and the Core switch. 
 I can ping both PC1 and PC2 and the core switch from PC3, however, I cannot ping both access switches and the firewall from PC3.
 ​
 I have an SVI configured with the IP address 192.168.3.1 on VLAN 30 on my Core switch. 
 I have a computer plugged directly into port 4 on the Core switch, but I cannot ping firewall. 
 ​
 I have been reading article after article and I know I have to be missing something stupid here. 
 ​
 I thought maybe it was because I didn&#x27;t have layer 3 enabled, so as a test, I even configured port 4 with the IP address 192.168.3.1 and enabled routing, but I still get the exact same results.
 ​
 I have a static route setup for 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 to forward traffic to 192.168.0.6 (firewall).
 I am able to get out to the internet from both PC1 and PC2 just fine, just not PC3.
 ​
 Furthermore, if I log into my switches web portal, I can switch to VLAN30 and I can ping out directly from the switch, but I still cannot ping either access switch or the firewall from the Core switch on VLAN30
 ​
 ​
 Any help would be so very gratefully appreciated. 
 Thank you so much in advance!
 Edit: Solved!

 I&#x27;m currently tasked with deploying a modest data center, and I&#x27;m looking for some recommendations on software to create network rack diagrams that include cabling and airflow.
 I&#x27;d like to create professional-looking diagrams that accurately reflect the constraints of our data center, and I&#x27;m hoping to get some input from the community on the best tools for the job. Whether you&#x27;re a seasoned pro or just starting out in the field, I&#x27;d love to hear what software you use and why you prefer it.
 Thanks in advance for your help and suggestions!

 In that post, I included an email sent to me from my account manager at FS. A few of the people in that thread brought up the idea that FS may not have had permission to reveal the skype(?) chatlog between them and the purchaser. For example;
  
– pmormr commented:
  
They won&#x27;t be working with Microsoft for long if their account managers are treating the deal as a non-consensual marketing exercise. That email if it circled back to legal would blow up the deal and possibly get them sued where I work.
  
– Newdles commented:
  
Yeah, expect Microsoft to kill this deal now. There are Microsoft employees here. Whoever sent this email should also be fired for terrible privacy practices.…</span>

 I am wondering if anyone can give me any suggestions here. I have traffic coming into let&#x27;s say VLAN10, hitting a firewall (I see this being passed), exiting via VLAN20, hitting the VLAN interface on ACI, and then not hitting the actual gateway of the destination subnet. 
 In a working traceroute I see: VLAN10 &gt;&gt; Firewall (static route out) &gt;&gt; ACI VLAN20 Interface &gt;&gt; Dest. Subnet Gateway &gt;&gt; Destination IP.
 Not working: VLAN10 &gt;&gt; Firewall (static route out) &gt;&gt; ACI VLAN20 Interface &gt;&gt; Timeout 
 Does anyone have any suggestions as to what can I check here? I am not very familiar with ACI. (The source is the same core router, different l3 vlans all taking the same path).

                              <span>Hi guys, 
 My boss told me to check the fortinet training/certification system, to start more in depth work with some client&#x27;s firewalls. 
 I&#x27;ve researching about it in their website, but is a bit confusing. So if someone who has more experience with i, could help me aswering some questions would be great. 
 1- Do I need to complete NSE 1-3 to do 4-6? Or any other above?
 2- I&#x27;m from Portugal, and I can&#x27;t find where to do the certification, if it is online or presencial in some partner.
 3 - The Courses in the differents levels, give general technical concepts in addition to the tools from the fortinet catalog? 
 Thanks in advance for the help.

                              <span>We currently control our L3 in our at&amp;t’s avpn offering. We have gre (mGRE) tunnels and bgp feeding various services via afi to various sites. Some sites even have various other types of encryption. From my understanding, typically the site rtr does NOT have MPLS config, though we still have MPLS qos config on each site rtr, along with the hub having MPLS qos config. Our hub feeds into another MPLS network we own - after collectors - so I’d presume, if the marking is kept, that it could be used for our campus MPLS qos (I think that’s the teams thought here). However, peeling back the onion, it was revealed to me by AT&amp;T, that each site doesnt necessarily have a COS profile ordered with them , which would explain some of the asymmetrical issues seen while traffic went through AVPN - maybe. My question is, if we are hopping around at layer 3 already, would MPLS markings still be seen or matter by AT&amp;Ts underlay somewhere? Even with just the basic GRE traffic, I’d figure that qos markings would be copied over maintained? Right now, I think the profile not being set as being the problem / waste.
 At a higher level to this, it seems like there’s a possibility that whoever architected the design so that we control L3, traded off the QoS perk gained from MPLS. Hopefully not.

                              <span>Noob question and I have a lot more research to do... 
 Problem: Running out of DHCP addresses
 Current setup with /23 is 192.168.0.0/23 for static IP addresses and 192.168.1.0/23 is for DHCP. We are looking into VLANS to help alleviate our available IP issue, but as a quick fix to more immediately alleviate this issue.. Could we go to /22 and can we specify the next subnet? i.e. could we do 192.168.21.0/22 or does it have to be 192.168.3.0/22 (do the subnets need to increase incrementally or can they be manually defined)?
 We don&#x27;t want to use subnet 3 because we have a site in our WAN that currently uses 192.168.3.0/24

 Any ideas why the traffic is visible in Wireshark but not in netstat/TCP?
 Any recommendations on what I could try doing?

                              <span>Hello Networking Gurus! 
 I had some recent network speed issues so I pulled out my trusty iperf3 to try and diagnose and I found something I am hoping you can help me with. I have a server in my office and other in my basement, about 75 feet of cable run between them. When I run iperf3 as the server on my basement linux (fedora) server and the client on my laptop I see lots (200,000+) of retr (retransmits). But when I do the reverse where the iperf3 server is in my office and the client is in the basement, I get few to no retr. This is very consistent, lots of retr going in one direction (office to basement) but few going the other way (basement to office). I have also run iperf3 server and client both on servers in my basement using the same switch as basement to office and that’s also pretty clean, few if any retr. 
 Does this point to a bad cable? Bad switch? Bad ends on the cables? What would you do to diagnose and clear this up?
 Thanks in advance for your wisdom and guidance!

                              <span>All flights from Lufthansa world wide is staying on the ground. Because of a single point of failure.
 Late yesterday afternoon, a drill cut four fiber optic cables from Deutsche Telekom during third-party construction work on a rail line in Frankfurt. As a result, Lufthansa is also experiencing IT problems.
 Two cables have already been repaired overnight by our technical team and many customers are already back online. We are continuing to work at high pressure on the repairs. The situation is improving continuously.
 Europes biggest carrier, shouldnt they have a backup / ha in place?

 I do not know anything about, the fiber Company, there might be the only cables delivering internet in that area, but seems like this could be avoided?

 So, i have a TP Link EC230-G1 that my friend gave to me, and it worked perfectly, except it wont give internet access to IPV6, while IPV4 does give internet, while it doesnt matter much to me but it kinda bothers me. Initially i tought this might be a DHCP conflict, so i assigned a slight difference of IPV6 address (like it ended with 9F i change it with 8F) to my Router (set as static ipv6 address), it does change, but then it would still not work, im at a loss of any solution here. My main GPON Router is Huawei HG8245H5.
 I really hope there is a solution to this problem :D

                              <span>For traffic separation purposes (customer vs company internal) I need to have two dynamic routing processes that do not exchange routes with each other.
 The routing devices will only be part of one dynamic routing process each. However they share a central subnet so they will see all routing packages that go over that network.
 My first idea was OSPF but I don&#x27;t know if I can have two completely disjunct areas. EIGRP is not an option as there are non-Cisco devices involved. 
 Any idea what would be my best option here?

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 currently facing issue with Huawei routers regarding netconf. I need to configure netconf on huawei devices, however i find that documentation on this subject is very limited and i couldn&#x27;t find any usefull information.
 ​
 I have an AR2200 router with firmware version from 2020 (V200R010), and according to this document, netconf should be somehow available on this device but i&#x27;m just not able to configure it in any way, nor am i able to connect to it with the netconf protocol (using -p 830 or -s netconf).
 ​
 Is anyone familiar with Huawei devices in general, or does anyone know what devices support netconf and how to configure it?
 ​
 Thanks for any help, i&#x27;m really clueless at this point :-(

                              <span>Can&#x27;t find an answer to this as every example has a 1:1 mapping.
 ​
 Consider a L3 leaf switch with 2 trunk ports. They serve different tenants I want to keep isolated. Eth1 connects to a baremetal server owned by A, Eth2 connects to a bare metal server owned by tenant B.
 Furthermore, each tenant wants to create their own self-service isolated networks for their VMs/Docker containers. Or they could just go and configure a vanilla Linux VLAN interface on their box to send their own VLAN tagged traffic on an arbitrary subnet. I don&#x27;t want to restrict this...
 Now normally I&#x27;d say A gets X vlans, B gets Y vlans, these are your subnets. But there aren&#x27;t enough VLANs to go by, also, I don&#x27;t want to restrict it to one server... I want the same L2 domain no matter which rack or switch the server…</span>

                              <span>For the vbond, vmanage and vsmart, we do a certificate signing request, send it off to the CA server and the CA server gives a ID cert. This is to be done for each of the controllers.
 On the videos I am watching, the same is not done for the vedge devices. Only the root cert is copied into the vedge and installed. 
 My question is, do the vedges need a ID cert? And if so, how does it get generated?
 If we don’t need a ID cert, then what’s the purpose of the root cert in the vedge?

The file will be downloaded to \\Fileserver\Fileshare get -delete *.txt \\server\userfolder # Disconnect close # Exit WinSCP exit

 Career wisdom for sysadmins, compliments of HouseCravenRaw: 
  
Irreplaceable is unpromotable
 Documentation is king
 Know your exits (rollback plan, etc.)
 Always get a CYA
 Toot your own horn—modesty doesn&#x27;t make money
 ‘No’ is a complete sentence
 Stability is paramount—don&#x27;t aim for newest or best, aim for reliable and dependable
 Cattle, not pets
 Make sure your cattle are self-minding—the less fiddling and doting and button-pressing you need to do, the better
 Make your own roadmap, be it your career or your department, have a direction and test it
 When you do a thing, understand why you are doing it. Google might give you an answer, but it doesn&#x27;t give you comprehension. Running a StackOverflow solution without understanding what&#x27;s going on will only lead to more problems in the future
 Don&#x27;t stay in one place too long
 Test your parachute, be it a tape backup or a rollback plan or a snapshot

                              <span>Does anyone know how to or if it&#x27;s possible to switch between the number of local monitors used in an RDP session without having to switch the settings and restart the session?
 I use my local machine for meetings to avoid audio lag and want to be able to see the meeting while working on my remote machine.
 When I&#x27;m not in a meeting I&#x27;d like to be able to quickly switch to having both monitors available to my RDP session.
 I&#x27;m using the default windows 10 Remote Desktop Connection Application.

                              <span>Just thought I’d put that out there. I’ve been doing this since the late 80’s and DNS has been the root cause of the problem precisely never.
 Printers, on the other hand…
 So (other than DNS) what’s your most problematic technology?

                              <span>Like the title says, I&#x27;ve got upper management claiming they need to be global admins, user admins, etc. 
 Before I was hired they were basically just winging it for managing their MS365 environment and giving anybody that needed any level of admin full blown global admin privileges. Now that I have started that isn&#x27;t going to fly and I am going through and taking away privileges. The issue is I have multiple people claiming they need admin permissions but judging by how things were done before I got here I am very hesitant to let anyone keep their privileges. I am leaning towards just taking the access away and see how long it takes for them to even notice but I would also like to have some data as to why I made that decision other than telling the CFO I don&#x27;t trust him to have admin privileges.
 Is there a report I can run showing the login history for the admin portals specifically? IE - I took your privileges away because you haven&#x27;t even logged into the admin portal since 2021.

                              <span>This advice that I&#x27;m sharing is regardless of your level of seniority or experience in the IT field, and not specific to Sys Admins, as there are plenty of other IT roles.
 There are a lot of jobs out there, many listings, and with the advent of remote/WFH the markets you can work in have substantially increased. This naturally results in an increased number of job opportunities for each of us to apply to or be considered for.
 So my advice, waste less of your time, less time of the recruiter, and get actually useful information up-front.
 If you&#x27;re a recruiter reading this, if you want to waste less of my time, give me these two things up-front. If you are an IT person (Sys Admin or otherwise) then it is in your best interest to require these two pieces of information FIRST, and yes even …</span>

                              <span>I manage a team of 10 (me+9). This morning one of my team texted me saying that they needed to take a mental health day. I texted back that those days are important, I didn&#x27;t want them to burn out, and I&#x27;d see them tomorrow. I hope they have a relaxing day playing video games or gardening or whatever they do to destress.
 Later in the day another guy was more or less reduced to tears after an encounter with an end-user. An hour later they were still visible shaken. I told him to take the rest of the day off, fully paid. Then I went and had a talk with the end-user and told them that their department and IT should be on the same team. I can&#x27;t have my people effectively helping him if he views us as the enemy and my team is scared to go help.
 Will we maybe have a larger load for the 8 of us left here today? Probably. Is it worth it so my people aren&#x27;t burnt out and leaving and we have to hire new people? Yes, 100x over.
 If you&#x27;re in a burnout situation, don&#x27;t let your company/MSP gaslight you into believing that all IT jobs are like that or that all managers/directors are like that. Pay for a resume refresh, apply for other jobs, find a place where you&#x27;re respected.

                              <span>Like many people I start my day with a list. Every day the majority of my list is &quot;following up with $vendor&quot;, I am just so tired of vendors doing half of the job and then ghosting us, or a service ticket with a vendor that has been active for months that has no sign of ever being resolved. At this point I have more issues and projects that I just accept as broken or un finished, its like they specialize in wearing you down until you just give in and give up. I never thought that most of my day would be spent this way.

                              <span>I apologize in advance for being a stickler for grammar, and am prepared to be downvoted into oblivion on this, but I figure with all the rants about crappy workplaces/salaries/time off/raises/bonuses/hours/oncall/workloads, I could throw in a mini rant for something that bugs me about posts here, and communications in general. It&#x27;s not just in IT/our field, it&#x27;s all over any type of forum/social media/emails/texts/communications. I&#x27;ve seen these mistakes in National/International ad campaigns from major companies - I guess they laid off all the copy editors in the most recent mass layoffs...
  
The plural of software is software, NOT softwares.
 Apostrophes are NOT for plurals - the plural of computer is computers, NOT computer&#x27;s.
 Apostrophes are for possession (That&#x27;s Joe&#x27;s computer), or for contractions (&quot;Joe&#x27;s using the computer&quot; instead of &quot;Joe is using the computer&quot;).
 Your is for possession - &quot;That&#x27;s your problem not mine&quot; NOT &quot;That&#x27;s you&#x27;re problem&quot;
 You&#x27;re is a contraction for &quot;you are&quot; - &quot;You&#x27;re going to the concert without me?&quot; NOT &quot;Your going to the concert without me.&quot;
  
And now back to our show...

                              <span>Hello r/sysadmin, I&#x27;m /u/AutoModerator, and welcome to this month&#x27;s Patch Megathread!
 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month&#x27;s updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft&#x27;s Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft&#x27;s updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn&#x27;t work.
 Test, test, and test!

                              <span>Emails from a self proclaimed &quot;cEo&quot; of some random software company. (I love checking their LinkedIn and seeing that they are a &quot;cUrRenT&quot; cEo&quot; of multiple companies at the same time, that&#x27;s always a good sign. /s
 &quot;Do I email you or [name of my CIO]? I have a lot of insight I want to share with you&quot;
 Me or my boss? Well, that&#x27;s easy, neither. You don&#x27;t get to email anyone here any more.
 The email has been reported as spam. The email/domain have been blocked company wide. The phone number has been blocked in the pbx.
 Numerous Phone calls/voicemails from (xxx) xxx-xxxx &quot;Hi, this is Nancy Adams, I need you to call me back when you get a chance. Thanks.&quot; Who the fuck is Nancy? Oh a random software company rep, oh...
 Blocked on PBX. Looked up company/domain/email, blocked on email, web filter. Left a solid yelp review indicating business marketing practices. I don&#x27;t think this is vindictive, not any more than calling someone leaving them a message saying &quot;Call me back!&quot;
 Every stupid fucking idea is brought to you by a recent bs-chool graduate who feels they need to &quot;apply&quot; their newly learned knowledge of bullshit.
 Do I sound upset? I&#x27;m a little upset. I&#x27;m done with this level of bullshit. This is a good place to vent.
 Edit: Why am I jumbling the case of the letters? It&#x27;s to indicate their level of L33tness.
 ​
 Edit2: I should add this comes on the heels of me actually calling one of the vendors back and saying we were not interested in their service at this time and in turn what they did is add me to a list and I received 12 phone calls from their competitors in 5 days. So I am NO LONGER calling anyone back. That is what I get for being a decent person.

                              <span>I need to be as low maintenance as possible. I&#x27;ve played the refurb game (yeah, yeah) with HP laptops to decent success but with a lot of small PITA issues over the years that have now become too time consuming to be worth it. 
 My requirements are low. Aside from Windows 10 Pro, I only need the user to connect to a VPN, use an EHR program and do Telehealth. So good camera/audio would be favorable but barely any firepower needed otherwise. 
 Basically wanna be like &quot;hey here&#x27;s your laptop you won&#x27;t need to bother me until you leave the company or you need a new battery years from now&quot; without breaking the bank. 
 Thanks guys

 A call home function effectively.
 Anyone know of a x86 hardware vendor that provides something like this?

                              <span>Hello
 We are trying to migrate our on prem Exchange 2016 server to 365, but appear to have hit a roadblock from initial assessment while working with our MSP and I wanted to know if anyone else has experienced this issue?
 We have an on prem Exchange 2016, with Business Standard licenses in 365.
 For the last 2-3 years we have been creating user in AD, with sync to 365 and giving them a Business Standard license, which includes a Teams License, and Mailbox.
 The Mailbox doesn&#x27;t get used in 365, but still gets added as part of enabling the license. We just route all our mail to the on prem instance and connect Outlook to local exchange.
 The Teams license however does get used for scheduling video calls, and also creating the odd group and channels.
 My understanding is that to do a hybrid migration (and enable it), you can&#x27;t have existing mailboxes in the cloud and those mailboxes need to be deleted.
 I also understand that Teams stores all the chat data in the mailbox as well. 
 So do we need to purge all our existing Team Groups in 365, and chat data as well as - then enable hybrid migration - and re-create them to do our migration successfully? 
 We also use SharePoint, but I don&#x27;t believe that will cause any problems to the exchange migration as far as I know.
 Thanks for your help/input.

                              <span>Microsoft has moved to limiting people to create or use whitelists of known IP address ranges via conditional access policies... versus allowing blacklists of known bad actors. I don&#x27;t understand this move. People are mobile, work from home, have cell phones and all of these things use DHCP. How is anyone narrowing down whitelists?
 Where have the blacklist options gone? Why are we perpetually guessing what shifted today with these products?
 Most importantly, why are people scrambling to find and locate such basic things as inbound blocking/allowing? It&#x27;s because we now need a Microsoft Defender license for this &quot;Feature,&quot; which I feel is far too basic to be locked behind monetary incentive, and was never a paid for feature before this year.
 Its incredible how many times I have had to pull back the customer&#x27;s expectations for what is possible and not, when even the lay person can use words like &quot;block&quot; but I can&#x27;t without talking about cost.

                              <span>Hi All, 
 An organization I am working for is looking to move away from their aging on-prem based sFTP server to a cloud based sharing platform with traditional sFTP support as well as a web based portal for easier customer access. 
 There are lots of file sharing / collaboration offerings out there but finding one with that is more or less a hosted service offering traditional sFTP client support along with web portal based access is proving difficult. 
 We have looked into Files / Egnyte. 
 Are there others that anyone can recommend that are similar to Files? Looking for a service that can scale starting small, maybe 60-70 customers and grow to 200+ with a predictable pricing model. Data usage is not a concern and will fall well below the capacity offerings of most of these services. 
 Anyways, open to suggestions as this seems a bit niche. 
 Thanks

 Sure, we could just pop them in Excel on a Teams/Sharepoint site but that seems too easy, are there any tools aimes at small businesses that will help is keep an asset inventory (hardware and software) or even a tool that exports (or integrates) with 365 that will let us view it in one place?
 Perhaps there&#x27;s a section in Intune/MEM that does all this, but I can&#x27;t seem to find it.

                              <span>Morning all,
 Maybe I&#x27;m reading in to this far too much, but I&#x27;ve noticed a lot of resellers seem to get irate at the idea that I have multiple people quoting for the same thing. Even more so when I receive a lower quote from someone else.
 I was wondering if maybe I am doing something wrong here? I&#x27;ve never thought much about it. Don&#x27;t see what&#x27;s wrong about trying to get the cheapest deal I can? But for example, we are currently quoting for a new chunk of hardware, we our usual supplier but also have 2 other companies this time who have both offered it cheaper. We&#x27;ve let our usual supplier know and they seem to be offended that we didn&#x27;t just blindly go with them? 
 Is it rude of me to give out their quotes for other people to try and match/best? I can&#x27;t imagine this sort of thing happening outside of IT but maybe I&#x27;m wrong.

 I&#x27;m hardening our environments and disabing TLS 1.0, i figured lets get TLS.1.1 out the way at the same time however today I broke RDP on a 2019 server implmenting this.
 TLS 1.2 was enabled both client and server keys as needed however after TLS 1.0 + 1.1 were disabled I couldnt RDP to the server (which is a domain controller). I was getting an NLA failure message - I do enforce NLA via GPO as its mandated by our cyber insurance coverage.
 I re-enabled TLS 1.1 and was able to resume normal operations on the server. Any ideas why this would break? The client (my laptop) has TLS 1.2 enabled, I cant understand why there is a reliance on TLS 1.1.

                              <span>Im sorry if this is a basic question, i cant find any help through google. Im a first year apprentice, so im still pretty new to all of this.
 Im essentially trying to configure a Syslog-Server with a Webinterface running on an Apache2 Webserver.
 I messed around a bit on my Raspberry PI4, and am now trying to replicate this on a VM at work. However im already failing at accessing the default page of the webserver.
 On my Raspberry PI and at home, all i had to do was install the server, and allow communication through my UFW. After that, i could reach the Default Page via my Raspberrys IP-Adress in my Browser. I assume it tried reaching the server on Port 80 by default.
 This however doesnt work on my VM. Firewall is active, the webserver can accept packages on port 80 and 443. However i cant even ping the VM from inside my network.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>Hi, We have two ESXi hosts connected directly to HP MSA 2040 via 10GbE DAC cables.
 We have another spare MSA 2040, can I use SAS cable to link them or I need to use FC/iSCSI?
 I have linked MSA to D2700 enclosure using the SAS cable, but not sure about MSA to MSA.
 Any help would be much appreciated, thank you.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve just inherited a deployment of a dozen or so VMs all setup in Azure, with more coming. These are currently all standalone with no domain, so each one doesn&#x27;t really have a consistent set of local firewall settings, local security policies etc. As I&#x27;m going to be hardening these in-line with the Security Centre recommendations, I&#x27;m thinking to add either a couple of DCs or Azure Active Directory Domain Services to the deployment, then domain-join the VMs so I can use Group Policy and standardize them all. Is this still the best approach, or is there a cloud-native agent that would let me achieve the same? Intune is out as these are all server OSes.

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on the setup of an Apache (forward) proxy that does a proxy chain for certain sites.
 Here is the virtual host config:
  #8007 extranet ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost DocumentRoot /var/www/html ErrorLog /var/www/log/error_8007.log CustomLog /var/www/log/access_8007.log combined ProxyRequests On ProxyVia On #some-site.com Proxy Chain ProxyRemote &quot;http://some-site.com/&quot; &quot;http://x.x.x.x:80&quot; ProxyRemote &quot;http://portal.some-site.com/&quot; &quot;http://x.x.x.x:80&quot; ProxyRemote &quot;http://apex.some-site.com:8089/&quot; &quot;http://x.x.x.x:80&quot; ProxyRemote &quot;http://info.some-site:8380/&quot; &quot;http://x.x.x.x:80&quot;  
 However, when I test it and try to access http://apex.some-site.com:8089/images/favicon-16x16.png
 the connection fails and the Apache log shows 
  - - [14/Feb/2023:10:21:04 +0100] &quot;\x16\x03\x01\x02&quot; 400 226 &quot;-&quot; &quot;-&quot;
 I googled it and it says the client tries to connect via https but I don&#x27;t get why. There is no https invloved. When I connect to the URL through the current proxy (that is to be replaced) my browser shows that the connection is not secure as it just http.
 Any idea why it&#x27;s trying https?

                              <span>Hi! We are a company with 30ish employees, I am looking for a solution that we can use for file storage for our projects.
 We have 100-150 projects a year, they have from a few Gigabytes up to 150-200GB of files associated to them. Most of them are images and binaries.
 I&#x27;d like to set up a centralized file storage for these projects. I&#x27;d like it to be easy to access, easy to admin and easy to back up. We have Microsoft 365 basic (and standard for some users). I&#x27;d prefer a cloud based solution because I don&#x27;t trust our network and I&#x27;m not touching that yet because I already own plenty of our infrastructure...
 Users are somewhat tech savvy but I&#x27;d prefer to have something that&#x27;s easy to set up and organize.
 Any suggestions are welcome!

                              <span>Hello everybody,
 I&#x27;m currently in the process of finding a digital signage solution for our business. Specifically, I&#x27;m looking for a solution that can display both websites and PowerPoint presentations and is remotely manageable.
 I&#x27;d like to setup 2 bigger touchscreens in the lobby. Visitors should be able to use the touchscreen to navigate through our website as well as display promotional materials such as PowerPoint slides. The player should have WiFi because cabling is a bit difficult.
 Does anyone have experience with a digital signage solution that fits these criteria? Any recommendations or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
 I have looked into Yodeck, Xibo and Posterbooking and Samsungs MagicInfo CMS solution. Tending to use Posterbooking + some smart touchscreen TV with a Fire Stick because this seems simple enough and up to 10 screens are free.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hiya, I work for an organisation with around 400 users, when it comes to Adobe most just use Adobe Reader but we currently have around 60 users licensed for Acrobat Pro and about 20 licensed for Creative Cloud. IT management want to recharge the cost of these licenses to departmental/team cost codes, but we&#x27;re really struggling with how to keep track of which licenses belong to which team. When a new license is purchased it just goes into one big pool in our Adobe Admin Console, we can allocate it to a new user but there&#x27;s nothing identifiable about the license itself so no real way to track it as an asset or tag it as owned by a particular team. What would be ideal is a system where we can create groups for different teams and then allocate licenses to each group, I&#x27;m just wondering if there&#x27;s any tool or method that makes this easily possible? Currently all I think to do is have a process of meticulous record keeping in an Excel workbook where we track how many licenses are purchased under each cost code and who is using each license, but this obviously isn&#x27;t ideal. We need to ensure that licenses are kept within the teams that are paying for them rather than moving around the organisation as people join and leave.

 We are using MS Apps standalone packages like 2016, 2019 &amp; 2021 and purchasing the key from the local market and online. Sync the key with different emails (Outlook.com)
 Transferring the license, reactivation, and tracking these details is very difficult.
 is there any tool or software (free and paid) availabile to manage this?
 I really appreciate any help you can provide.

 Wondering if anyone has better details on what is actually involved in this process.
 Also - 10GB, what are they doing, moving to steam?

                              <span>Hey all. Happy after valentines day. I&#x27;ve got a problem eating at me. And yes I realize I should leave the shit at work. But. 
 I have engagement (tehe) with a vendor on a project recently. They provide SaaS for my company. We are trying to stand up a new site to site. Problem is we don&#x27;t see the tunnel (policy based) come up. My next steps were to do an embedded pcap as I am not seeing any traffic from the host at the firewall. I send an email to the vendor saying I see no traffic each time we test... but then after I explicitly point at the host in one of my emails we see an icmp request come across the fw about an hour later. Following I get an email from their pm asking me to explain steps I see in the network and they are requesting an additional resource to look at our network. 
 Now the question. And don&#x27;t get me wrong, this is indeed ego related, but my ego isnt that big (is it?). 
 Previously when setting up the site to site, I worked with a respectable sounding network engineer. Would it be wrong to reach out to him and ask him what the hell? (Respectfully.) The problem is that the traffic never leaves the host. We have routes out and they proved it via ping. 
 TLDR: I want to hear about times that you all took back alleys to get things accomplished. Or do we all just play the follow along and provide pcap when requested?

                              <span>Looking for advise how to join Cisco AP into existing mobility express. I need to join in mesh mode. To avoid Ethernet cables. All of them are powered by PoE adapter next to them. ME is running on 2x AIR-AP3802I-E-K9 where One is controller and second is wired access point(this will be ROOT for other wireless) AP that i need to deploy as wireless points of network are: 3x AIR-CAP3702E-E-K9. &amp; 3x AIR-AP2802I-E-K9. Also if possible to deploy AIR-CAP1702I-E-K9 v02 (these old devices am not sure if can be used here) 
 So 1x controller ME 3802i + 2x RAP mesh ap 3802i +2802i +5 x MAP mesh from others( these can be upgraded to 5 more)

                              <span>I have been trying to figure out the best method to test and troubleshoot this issue I&#x27;m seeing. Every day around the same time, one of our sites&#x27; (public high school) bandwidth drops to nothing for about 15 minutes. I ran iperf tests on repeat and logged the output across the WAN to the site and I was getting around 1.8Gbits/s on a 2Gbits/s connection. Right around the time the students leave the bandwidth tanked in iperf (just across the WAN to the DC) and on speedtest.net to 30Mbits/s for between 5 and 15 minutes. Seems to happen each day around that time and then just clears up.
 I have smokeping running and that looks clean and never shows a change. I don&#x27;t drop regular ping packets but if I run a faster fping I do see between 1%-4% packet loss around that time. Interfaces on my router are clear. Nothing in the logs of the routers on either side. Something tells me it&#x27;s the WAN provider but I am out of ideas on what to test or how to prove the issue further. I plan on reaching out to them tomorrow to see if they can seen anything on their side but I know that will be tough to get them to research it. Any recommendations on what else to try and test?
 TIA!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m in the process of replacing the firewalls at our main site as well as our DR site and had a question as to what the best way to setup SSL VPN connections for our users would be. The current setup is non-existent in that my predecessor never did any SSL VPN config on the DR firewall (I don&#x27;t know how they thought that was going to work in a disaster).
 Each site is going to have a pair of Palo Alto 3410s in active/passive HA. I&#x27;d like to try to avoid having to setup each user with 2 different SSL VPN configs (one for normal use and one for DR use) and the only way of doing this that comes to mind immediately would be for me to have a virtual firewall in the cloud that I use to terminate all of the client SSL VPN connections to and then have a site to site VPN between that firewall and both the production site and the DR site. With that setup, in a DR scenario I wouldn&#x27;t have to touch the SSL VPN config, just route the traffic from the virtual firewall to the DR site rather than the main site. Obviously this would require extra licensing for the virtual firewall and increases complexity but I&#x27;m thinking it might be worth it to not have to setup every user with multiple SSL VPN configs and explain to them to use the DR one in a DR scenario.
 I don&#x27;t have much experience with SSL VPN configs on Palo Alto firewalls yet, so if there is an easier or more efficient way to achieve this please feel free to suggest. Thanks.

When I wanted to mark it as configured wrong, I used ping and tracert from one network (PC to PC) to another, not directly configured router, and it worked ping got through. Can somebody explain why can be IP address of network used as next hop or is it just Pkt bug?
 I have never heard that IP address of network can be used as next hop.
 Static from router:
 ip classless

                              <span>Full disclosure, I am not a PM so I am struggling to know what to do to move to the next phase according to PMO practices. Here is the story and I&#x27;m hoping you fine folks can point me in the right direction. Have put our Firewall on the FY 23&#x27; replacement radar so I&#x27;ve seen demo&#x27;s from a few vendors on their product, all vendors had our requirements beforehand on what I am looking for in a FW. We are not married to the big &#x27;C&#x27; so I have ventured out to the competition and for the most part I have liked Fortinet and Checkpoint. I have invited all engineers in my department who have worked with our current FW and may administer the next solution (disappointingly they rarely showed up to the the Demo&#x27;s). So now that I have spoken with the vendors of interest whats next? Do I make a decision based on what I&#x27;ve seen? Do I gather the team and ask, &quot;Okay who should be continue to speak with in the next phase&quot;. We can&#x27;t take demo&#x27;s because I work for a Govt agency and its a against company policy, but I want to make the best decision possible that will benefit the organization. Can someone help me understand where I go from here?

                              <span>Dear networking pros at reddit...
 I have a grown /24 network I have to manage at our company because our networking colleague left the company...
 All adresses are used and therefore some colleagues get no ip address at all - as expected. 
 Now I don&#x27;t really know how to professionally create a solution. First approach was to create a new /22 network but I read something about problems due to the Broadcast overhead with this many clients in a Single subnet.
 Currently I consider a multi-subnet network for our lan and wifi. But I simply don&#x27;t know how to design this to avoid any problems in the future. 
 LAN ports can be assigned to the subnet, maybe one /24 per floor.
 My question is: How do I setup our wifi in the building? We currently have one SSID and I would like to keep this. How do I split this up? Same SSID with different subnets?
 Thank you for your input!

                              <span>We&#x27;re deploying Opengears around the US and global for OOB. This will be major cities primarily but you never know (one of our datacenters is in the boonies of NJ, for example).
 I think the answer here is a global-roaming multi-carrier SIM. One vendor, all networks, don&#x27;t have to pay attention to where we ship it. Ideally it lets us also choose whatever carrier has best signal instead of being locked to the carrier we bought the sim from.
 I was looking at Twiliio, and the platform is just super cool, but we&#x27;re not large enough for them to be interested in giving us a better rate. So I&#x27;m looking around for other choices. If twilio is the only choice then I&#x27;ll hold my nose and pay, but it&#x27;s worth asking what else there is. 
 Let&#x27;s figure a burn of around 15MB/day so around 500MB/unit/mo. Not huge, not zero. Bogey being here occasionally we may want to use it for backup IP for the site, in which case we&#x27;ll be burning 10s of GBs. But maybe that&#x27;s ok in the case since it will be an emergency. (We normally run dual ISPs for offices but not everywhere has decent alternatives etc.)
 No, I don&#x27;t expect it to be free, I just also don&#x27;t want to get bent over, so to speak.
 Who else plays in this space that is worth talking to?

                              <span>We have 2 SonicWALLs one in the US and one in Asia with a site to site VPN to each other for a call center. 
 The call center voice router and server is behind the US sonicwall. 
 Users in Asia also have a per user L2TP VPN for wfh days.
 Here’s the issue: When Asia users are at the office (hence using the site to site VPN in Asia) they experience call drops and crazy packet loss on the calls.
 We know this because the voice router/server monitors the calls.
 When Asia users are at the office and turn on their L2TP VPN to call, the calls are perfect with less than 10% packet loss. 
 Why would users experience better call quality using an L2TP vpn behind the sonicwall rather than just the site to site? It’s also all the same equipment too (wfh vs office)
 I’ve tried MTR and trace routes but since I can’t see the route behind the VPN i haven’t been able to pin point the issue.

                              <span>Hello, Actually working as a network engineer (6y of experience), I feel anxious and depressed almost all the time because idk what to do anymore. Traditional networking is about to disappear, what to do next? Learn SDN? Cybersecurity? Cloud techs? Learning is not the problem, how to practice is the issue for me, if I don’t practice it’s kind of useless to just read, i switched back to field engineering from presales because i cant just read to understand and have the concepts memorized If you’ve been there? What did you do ?
 Thank you

 We all know that Palo Alto is more expensive than Fortinet, but I need to put concrete numbers to it. &#x27;Not just purchase price, but typical AV/IPS updates. Thanks.

                              <span>So I get called into redoing a network for an SMB. They just bought this business and their server is ancient and failing. All they need is a file server so we decided to switch them to a structured p2p network. Our &quot;server&quot; is 32 GB Ram, 2 1TB hard drives that mirror every night. Everything looks great, except they have 2 VDI thin clients machines. Is there any way to get them to work in a P2P network? They didn&#x27;t give me information on them whenever we discussed the job; I&#x27;ll be honest, VDI is not in my wheelhouse. Any tips would be GREATLY appreciated.

                              <span>I recently got complaints from two different customers regarding lags in Microsoft Teams meetings, when multiple users on the network join the meeting individually.
 As far as I understand this, Teams is working like this:
 - Call between two people on the same network: Media traffic goes P2P
 - Call between two people not on the same network: All the media traffic goes through Microsoft servers
 - Call between multiple persons inside and outside the network: All the media traffic goes through Microsoft servers
 The last scenario is where they experience the problems – especially, when the number of internal people in the meeting is high, as every Teams client seems to up- and download all the media traffic.
 Have you experienced the same? Is there anything you can do about it? How do really large companies handle it, when they have like hundreds of people joining a Teams meeting for trainings of stuff like that?

                              <span>Hello guys,
 ​
 I don&#x27;t know why, but it&#x27;s easy for me to understand the core concepts of MPLS than MTU...
 Yes, by &quot;MTU&quot; I still mean Maximum Transmission Unit. I have read all these blogs, watched all these videos explaining MTU and its problems, but still here I am and ask for your help. 
 Let&#x27;s say we have some simple topology: 
 Switch-A - Router - Switch-B 
 Switches are just L2 switches, all routing happens on the router (which is actually L3 switch). Assume that all switches have 48 access ports and support Jumbo frames. Some servers and clients are connected to these access switches in a random way. 
 Okay, now I want to enable Jumbo frames on my network because some (only some!) servers require this. I did it on all ports between network equipment, so there is no MTU mismatch on the network core. Now, let&#x27;s say I enabled Jumbo frames support on some access ports and on the servers connected to these ports. So we have:
  
Jumbo frames are enabled on all links between network devices.
 Jumbo frames are enabled on some access ports and on the servers connected to these ports.
 All other access ports and devices connected to these ports have default MTU.
 
 My questions are:
  
What will happen if a client with default MTU sends some data to a server with 9000+ MTU if:
 Client and Server are in the same L2 segment?
 What will happen if the server with 9000+ MTU sends some data to the client with 1500 MTU if:
 Client and Server are in the same L2 segment?
 What will happen if a client with default MTU sends some data to the server with 9000+ MTU if: Client and Server are in the different subnets?
 What will happen if the server with 9000+ MTU sends some data to the client with 1500 MTU if:
 Client and Server are in the different subnets?
  
Thanks.

                              <span>Just curious how widely or if anyone is using Intel vPro to enable their RMM. I don’t think there is any straight vPro RMM, but I know there are a few applications that leverage it to enable remote management. If you have used (a RMM that leveraged) this, can you share your experience?

                              <span>I have been doing IT for about 25 years now and never been so stressed and full of anxiety. Seems like every time I turn on the news or anything these big companies are getting compromised. Every time I see something strange, crowdstike alert, or phishing attempt my heart starts racing thinking what did I do wrong. To know if I make 1 mistake or forget to patch 1 thing and open a hole I could ruin a company. It is starting to affect my home life as well. 
 How do people cope with this? I have really been thinking about switching careers, but no idea what I would want to do. I love technology and can&#x27;t see myself do anything else but can&#x27;t go on living like this.

                              <span>Genuinely asking as I see a lot of people post in this subreddit about the negatives of working at an MSP. No surprise here, I currently work at an MSP. And while it is absolutely crazy sometimes, I also find myself listening to our customers talk about their jobs and they all seem extremely stressed as well. What I personally like about the MSP life is that it offers diversity:
  
Diversity of equipment. Every customer brings a different set of “happy little accidents” to the table and I find that challenge interesting even if I’m not personally the one helping to architect new solutions.
 
Diversity of focus. If you want to be pigeon-holed or expertise in a specific area, you can. But there are also tons of opportunities for crossover experiences in other areas.
 
Diversity of customer. Yes you get difficult customers. But you also get some pretty great ones to work alongside. I feel like this is a big benefit and helps to balance the crazy sometimes.
 
Diversity of ideas. In some ways you’re playing with house money. You can help the customer come up with solutions without having to worry about the dollars and cents. After all, that’s on them to figure out at the end of the day. Obviously you have to be reasonable and help work toward something that benefits everyone involved. But again, that’s a challenge that can be fulfilling.
 
 Those are just a few. And sure, you could read those with the same lenses of a non-MSP job. But isn’t that the point? Why is it such a negative too work at an MSP? Interested to hear from others.

                              <span>The CEO of the company is asking to look into migrating folders/files from the file server to sharepoint. I am not a sharepoint expert but wanted to ask for those of you who have done this, do you recommend this? Pros and Cons? Any pain points or issues? Obviously every company is different and this solution might work for some but not others. Not sure how to determine if this would be a good idea or not. 
 We do have Quickbooks running on a terminal server but I would keep QB files away from sharepoint and have them on a file server still.
 File server contains about 1TB of data and company has about 50-60 users. Please let me know if there is any relevant information that you would like me to include.

                              <span>I’d like to have a tool set at each office server room, but it will probably be used once or twice a year at most. I see a lot of tool kits on Amazon that would probably work. This wouldn’t be my primary set, but instead something I could ship/order to the remote offices ahead of time so I don’t need to deal with taking tools with me.

 I&#x27;ve got the domain part implemented, but the attachment part looks like there is no &quot;all&quot; capability. I&#x27;d prefer to not get granular unless I have to.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

 I am a middle aged - say late 40s - IT Manager. My background is a Windows generalist.
 I have degree, not much in certifications, 25+ years of systems experience. I&#x27;ve done desktop support, led a helpdesk, been a Sys Admin, Sys Engineer (whatever that title means) and eventually wandered into management. I can cover a few bases - SQL Queries, basic networking, Power BI, PowerShell. I know my way around AD and M365 pretty well. IE - I am a Windows Jack of All Trades, certified master of none. I have been in my current role for just over 6 years, leading a small team (3 people) for a medium sized blue collar company. I make just under 6 fi…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working this job for only about 6 months now, and I&#x27;ve already done more work than over half our staff. I&#x27;m getting stressed from the unrealistic expectations being given to us with patching.
 I have a manager who knows nothing about IT and never remembers anything we teach them. 
 For the first time today, I had to step out while I had a breakdown because I couldn&#x27;t take this. Shit is in flames every other day, but we can&#x27;t even improve our infrastructure because we don&#x27;t have time to do anything outside of playong catch up with patching.
 Nobody has specified tasks or jobs, and nobody is being held accountable for their mistakes. How the hell do you guys do this, because I&#x27;m already second-guessing my choice of taking this path. I didn&#x27;t sign up for a job where I do tickets, patch EUDs, troubleshoot server issues, and am being screamed at in my ear to hurry to Win11. 
 For reference, we have 1000+ rotating users and devices across the entire US. We have staff at each site, but most only do tickets.

                              <span>So for context, I am the IT support\SysAdmin person for the company I work for. The IT department consists of just me and the IT manager. I handle all support requests, whether it be end user support or system administration tasks. We provide IT to all branches of the company located accross very different time zones, so I get calls or texts very early mornig or middle of the night. I am at a point where I feel I just want to quit, I have no personal life anymore, and have given up most of my hobbies because of work. However since I live in a third world shit hole, good work is basically impossible to come by so I dare not leave.
 Any SysAdmins or support staff here in a similar boat, and how do you deal with it?

                              <span>Good morning rulers of the IT infrastructure. I purchased a domain which was a pornography website in 2013. It is still being flagged as porn with Barracuda Networks and a number of other companies. It is also blocked at the country level for many middle eastern and Asian countries. The domain name itself does not indicate pornography in anyway. It is rather bland. I am trying to create a list of providers to submit appeals and can use your help. I found an old thread from 7 years ago, but I am sure there have been updates since then. Any help is appreciated and if you have other ideas on how to lift the country restriction, please toss them out!

 Here is my current list (will update as more come in):

 I&#x27;m done with software developers that have no idea how a computer works.
 Done with a &quot;project manager&quot; that has 0 common sense, and can&#x27;t be an adult and take responsibility for his own fuckups. Then I have to spend 3 days fixing it.
 Done with users who can&#x27;t put the effort in to read anything past the first 3 words of an email.
 Been working here since 1998. And I&#x27;ve reached &quot;fuck it, I&#x27;m out.&quot;

                              <span>Feels like remote positions are becoming more and more ridiculous with their expectations and requirements, smells to me like more H1B nonsense. 
 Anyone have any luck lately landing a fully remote position? I&#x27;ve been fully remote for like five years and it feels like more and more orgs are viewing it as taboo, meanwhile it makes zero sense to me...especially for companies that don&#x27;t have the space to have employees onsite. 
 Feels like companies are more concerned about making you waste your time and cut productivity in half just to justify some form of an office space and real estate expenses. 
 I&#x27;ve been looking for a new gig for about 5 months now because the startup I joined is entirely dysfunctional and I&#x27;m doing 38 different jobs for one salary and I legit can&#x27;t handle it anymore, the market feels like it&#x27;s entirely frozen over. Even the postings that are available online I don&#x27;t get a single hit on. Or I get a recruiter who responds to me via direct message on LinkedIn and never follows up. 
 How is anyone capable of working in three different cloud platforms, an expert database engineer, an infrastructure engineer, front end, back end guru, oh and you need to know IBM tools from 35 years ago. 
 COBALT EXPERIENCE IS A HUGE PLUS!!!!

                              <span>Hello everybody
 i am basically done with my knowledge.
 We have an enviroment where all computers got moved from one domain to another.
 The procedure was:
 Remove computer from old domain
 Add computer to new domain
 Between the old and the new domain was never a trust setup and they don&#x27;t share a name.
 But now it gets strange:
 All computers that were in the old domain apply a policy for user privleges with the old &quot;Domain User&quot; Group and the old GUID. (I compared the guids)
 The computers are not a member of that domain anymore and we dont figure out why they apply those old policies.
 The new Policy with the new &quot;Domain Users&quot;-Group wont be applied at those two offices but within the main office the policy gets applied (it was connected to the old domain controllers.)
 ​
 The profiles with the old domain still exist on the computer but are not active anymore.
 The old DC is still arround (data is needed) but we cut the connection and applied the policies again and it still applies the old group.
 In HKLM:\Software\Microsoft\Windows\GroupPolicy\History are no suspicies entries.
 ​
 I know its kinda confusing and i can try make a bit clearer.
 ​
 Thank you for your help!
 ​
 P.S: I am sorry for the confusing text, i try edit it, to be more clear!

                              <span>Not sure if this belongs here. It&#x27;s a strange situation i don&#x27;t really want to go into deep details. But i need a tiny hotspot that i can potently keep in my car or bag and provide wifi pretty far. Reason is strange. I do alot of work for my offices where for some reason LTE or 5G is horrible inside the building. The other day i discovered if i place my cradlepiint right by the window and use wifi i can have connection in the data closets. My issue i cannot carry a big ass Asus router always. I was was hoping to something smaller and with reception
 Nice to have 1. Smaller 2. Good atenta with good reach 3. Poe powered or convert my self to USB PD using Barrel or power it using adapter and power cradle point of it using POE
 Cheers 
 Sorry if this the wrong place to ask for this.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I&#x27;ve been trying out different remote softwares to use instead of teamviewer/anydesk. The purpose is to control different laptops in a congress centre and all I need is to be able to control the OS. 
 Now I&#x27;ve tried Splashtop and Screenconnect and Google Remote all to my frustration. What I like about Teamviewer and Anydesk is that I download 1 app that I can connect from and to. It seems the ones I tried all need a different host and client app(splashtop), need logging in from a browser (google, screenconnect), need to create a secured token per session (screenconnect), or shortkeys can&#x27;t be used (google). I don&#x27;t need any bells and whistles since I&#x27;m not offering remote support, I just need basic control of my own laptops. A steady connection to about 12 laptops from 3-4 laptops in a directors booth with the possibility of connecting through a code with a possibility to remember/save the connections that I made will do just fine. 
 Anyone got a suggestion for a well functioning, really basic and cheaper alternative to Teamviewer/Anydesk?
 Cheers!

 All drivers updated, dock updated but still the meet sucks. Any fix for this?

 I have ADFS farm and also Exchange DAG. When I turn off primary ADFS (I switch primary role to secondary ADFS server) and in the same time migrate mailbox database to another Exchange server. I am getting owa/auth/errorfe.aspx?msg&#x3D;WrongAudienceUriOrBadSigningCert, when I am trying to log into OWA/ECP.
 btw: I set up owa/ecp adfs authentication (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/using-ad-fs-claims-based-authentication-with-outlook-web-app-and-eac-exchange-2013-help)
 ​
 Any idea why I cant log into OWA? ActiveSynch, EWS, MAPIoverHTTP works :(

                              <span>Hi team, 
 I am running into some issues with a scheduled task that was created on a Windows 08 server and got imported into a Window Server 2019 server. 
 There are 3 &quot;Actions&quot; specified within the job, each of which makes a call to a batch file. (Each of these batch file involves with copying file from a local folder to a SFTP server. The exact same scheduled job works perfectly fine on the Windows 08 server but when I run on on our Win 2019 server, 
 I kept getting this below error code 2147942401
 Task Scheduler successfully completed task &quot;\task1&quot; , instance &quot;{da5651d2-d5b3-4e1a-8844-c68c7dcba160}&quot; , action &quot;C:\Windows\SYSTEM32\cmd.exe&quot; with return code 2147942401.
 I spent hours and hours trying to troubleshoot but I am not getting anywhere. 
 So far I tried 
  
Added the account with sufficient privilege to &quot;Log on as a batch job&quot; in Local Security Policy
  specified the &quot;Start In&quot; folder path 
 using Powershell within the scheduled task to call the batch files 
  
None of the above work, those batch files work if I just double click on them. 
 Any help would be much appreciated :)

                              <span>Hay guys,
 in the next few weeks i want to implement fs logix.
 Before i run into several errors i want to know your experience and opinion about fs logix.
 Do you have any problems with it? What happens when i login one user on two servers? for example when i use a loadbalancer and one server crashes, so the loadbalancer switch the user to an other server.
 Do you have experiences with profile curruption?
 Currently i use romaing profiles.
 Do you guys have made other experiences - good or bad? Please let me know so i can be prepared.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hey all. I&#x27;ve got a 2012r2 terminal server that is due to be replaced here in the next 6 months or so. Until that time I&#x27;ve got a reoccurring issue where the vNic on the server will just fail to resolve dns. Internal dns works, external does not. I&#x27;ve even manually added external dns (like 8.8.8.8) and it still won&#x27;t resolve. All other servers on this domain work fine. The only fix I&#x27;ve been able to get to work, but not permanently, is to remove the vnic from vsphere, and then add a new one, and configure it with the static ip and such. Anyone run into this before and have a solution, or am I missing something simple here?

                              <span>So I feel like my job title could be hurting me from getting a job. My official job title is customer technical service representative. But I do way more than just talking on the phone. Here&#x27;s the deal. Eventually I would like to pivot out of IT. The reason is because I am more passionate about Science, Biology and Health. I would like to get my masters in Public health and my job won&#x27;t pay for it if it&#x27;s not job related. Plus I would like to work in those fields listed above. But it&#x27;s gonna be hard going from tech support to say a business analyst, regulatory affairs, health policy or any type of non IT job. So I changed my resume title to business analyst. EVen though that&#x27;s not my official job title. My manager has seen my resume and said it looks good. I&#x27;m not sure if he paid attention…</span>

 I don&#x27;t really want to set up a domain or azure account for Intune just for 1 laptop though, and that&#x27;s really all of my experience with mdm. What do you guys use for small environments that won&#x27;t cost me a ton of time and money to get going?

                              <span>Hey sysadmin people,
 I&#x27;m here in hopes you can give me an idea what might be the issue with the following problem:
 The customers has Exchange online with two shared mailboxes attached to their account, to counter the lag they experience when clicking on E-Mail, I&#x27;ve enabled the Exchange Cache. That does just fine for their main email but for the shared mailboxes this doesn&#x27;t work at all, nothing is loaded it&#x27;s just empty.
 If I disable it again, everything works great. Currently I&#x27;m running Exchange Offline with &quot;Downloading Shared Mailboxes&quot; disabled but that&#x27;s obviously suboptimal as I want them to be cached too.
 - It&#x27;s the latest Windows 10
 - Latest Version of Outlook 2019
 - Tried creating a new profile
 - Tried deleting the cache manually
 It&#x27;s just like Shared Mailboxes is cursed for me. What am I doing wrong?

 Has anyone successfully prevented the installation of Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime? I also saw this post, but there was no resolution to it.
 I also noticed this &quot;Note&quot; on that Microsoft article:
  
Clearing the check box won’t remove WebView2 Runtime from devices on which it has already been installed. Only new installations of WebView2 Runtime are prevented.
 There is no policy setting (for Group Policy or Cloud Policy) to turn off the automatic installation of the WebView2 Runtime.

 Does anyone have a good resource for looking for Dell partnumber specifications?
 I&#x27;m trying to find out the specs for this Dell SSD:
 SKU: 400-ACTW
 P/N: 9VJX5
 ​
 But my Dell rep is ghosting me and dell.com is anything but helpful, suggestions are welcome :)

 Thanks,

                              <span>These are some funny encounters that I had while helping around with some IT work. Some of them could be avoided by provisioning better training, others maybe people just had a bad day.
 #1 I once got a call to see a computer asap that &quot;definitely had a virus&quot;.
 On the same day, I got delivered there a new keyboard there.
 When entering the office I was welcomed by a guy showing me how each of the apps he would open would not work properly and in word... space button would be pressed continuously.
 As you could probably tell by now, the virus was on a shelf, where the old keyboard was stored, pressing the space button. 
 #2 After setting up an entry system with an intercom, I went home to get a very disappointing call just before entering my place. &quot;The system is not working.&quot; After troubleshooting remotely, I had to be on my way to see what is happening. I get a phone call just before, saying that they just realised that someone pressed the break glass button to exit the building. The emergency button had a case around it and looked very different from the exit one which is touch-free.
 A couple of days later, when setting their cards, I could see that someone would answer the intercom and they would go to open the door manually. But this one is on me, I did not leave specific instructions on how to unlock it. 
 #3 Once got called in to help someone find the attach button from outlook. I&#x27;ve also had numerous cases of &quot;it&#x27;s not working&quot;, &quot;is it plugged?&quot;, &quot;nevermind, thank you&quot;.

                              <span>I’m in the broadcast/events world and have had a request come through that has me a bit stumped as to what direction to take.
 A client of mine is looking after an event for a client in the finance sector who has previously had trouble sharing and controlling the digital assets generated for they’re annual conference. Think loads of powerpoint files and video content. Changes and updates are frequently made right up until the presenter walks onstage.
 The assets are generated by the end client’s own internal teams hence the usual solutions of ftp/dropbox/removable media that we would rely on are off the table due to the end client’s security policies.
 My first thought was some hosted storage appliance that we could replicate locally once we get onsite. That way the client’s IT can administer the appliance as they see fit and the local clone/cache will ensure speedy transfers once we get to the pointy end onsite at the event and need to ingest to the show machines. The event is well supported internally and the internal IT teams have been pretty good to work with on similar events in the past as long as we are reasonable in our requests and timescales.
 Any thoughts/reactions from those in the finance sector?

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m delegating control to IT support users so that they can join a PC to the local AD domain. I&#x27;m using the Delegate Control option on the parent OU.
 When the computer object does not exist, then everything&#x27;s working ok.
 When the computer object already exists, I get an error when trying to join again to the domain. (in cases for a re-formatted computer, etc.)
 The permissions I gave to the IT support group are the following:
 You chose to delegate control of objects in the following Active Directory folder: domain.local/Parent The groups, users, or computers to which you have given control are: ACL-AD-DomainJoin (DOMAIN\ACL-AD-DomainJoin) They have the following permissions: 
  
Read 
 Create All Child Objects 
 Delete All Child Objects 
 Change password 
 Reset password 
 Read and write account restrictions 
 Read and write personal information 
 Validated write to DNS host name 
 Validated write to service principal name 
 Read and write DNS host name attributes
  
​
 For the following object types: Computer 
 If I delete the computer object manually, then the join-domain task is ok.
 The thing is that I don&#x27;t want to manually delete each object every time, I want this to happen automatically.
 Do you have any ideas about what I&#x27;m missing here? I&#x27;m trying to accomplish this using the least privilege in mind. Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>We are having an issue with outlook where it will become disconnected from the exchange server after trying to send one email. However when you restart it will send the previous email but then disconnect again. I have had this issue before and I ended up using an old looking piece of software so I could disable some client side SSL / TLS options. I cannot remember what the name of this software is, if anyone has any ideas or knows a tool that can do this it would be highly appreciated.

                              <span>OK, so every tutorial out there makes this more confusing than it needs to be, as far as I understand it. I&#x27;ve been running my own mailservers (I know, it&#x27;s a challenge) for about 25 years now, fairly successfully (my server&#x27;s mail gets accepted by the big players, which was a tough task to accomplish over the years, but I finally got Microsoft to clear my IP-addresses, even though they assumed they were part of an entirely bad reputable block of addresses). OK, so here I am, strange how even I question the use of _dmarc every now and then. As a result of weird behavior while migrating from server 1 to server 2 I had to change _dmarc policy to none.
 SPF is correct, DKIM passes for all, but I just want to be certain;
 All mail account users and mail-domains reside behind one hostname and one IPv4 and one IPv6 address. They all send and receive mail using those, SMTP is on that one address. Am I still correct in assuming that setting policy to &quot;reject&quot; should be fine then?
 No other servers should try and send mail using any of our system&#x27;s domain names. If they do, mail should be rejected. None of my users try to use gmail or others to use our email-addresses as aliases, so that problem is non existent. And websites using these domainnames, that may have mail-forms are all using our smtp as well. Are there any exceptions to this that I&#x27;m missing?

                              <span>My inhouse email security app detected a 200x increase of incoming SMTP sessions from many countries (in a 4 hour time period). 99% was blocked as it was from low reputation senders.
 The 1% was as below (log from email security):
 reverse_DNS: a_randomdomain.net IP: indian_IP, russian_IP, chinese_IP etc Sender Domain: mycompany.com Sender: staff@mycompany.com Recipient: name@a_third_domain.com 
 Keep in mind those were incoming sessions and looked like the sender was from my company. (while only for outgoing sessions the sender should be from @mycompany)
 There were like 200 emails like this, from many different countries and IPs, they all tried to spoof my domain and they all had the same recipient name@a_third_domain.com
 What is this type of attack? Were they trying to attack this third_domain through my company? Or were they trying to attack me?

                              <span>Hi, one of my users is constantly complaining about his laptop crashing when entering sleep mode/when he leaves it for a while. The problem is that my collegue has already tried installing all of the newest drivers and did basically all he could. He ended up resintalling Windows which helped for a while. When the issue appeared again, we decided to give the user a brand new device but it started happening again. We suspect it might be one of the Apps he installs without our knowledge. ERROR ID in logs is 6008.
 Does anyone of you know a work-related app that might cause this? Or anything else that might cause it. Thank you very much!

 What is the best method to move Databases from an old server to a new server and What would be the best way to view which users that access each of the databases or how often the Db is accessed, I wanted to audit to see which databases are being used so i may know what to leave behind when i migrate to the new server, i tried server audit action but still can see which users are accessing which databases, i set some actions i thought would work before but i still cannot see who the users are. am moving to a new server and am trying to see what can be left behind or consolidated

 I&#x27;d like you to know:
  
ADHD is misnamed. It&#x27;s not really about Attention Deficit or Hyperactivity, that&#x27;s just two of the first symptoms seen in children. It doesn&#x27;t get renamed because it&#x27;s in legislation (including the ADA). 
 
It&#x27;s about Executive Function, and in Adults that shows up differently. It can be a hyperactive brain. It can be difficulty maintaining concentration. But it can also be difficult to stop concentrating on something that you find fascinating. Most adults can &#x27;get by&#x27; if they&#x27;ve only a mild form of this disability. (I did for 30+ years). 
 
Not all children obviously have the &#x27;stereotypical&#x27; ADHD, and they get missed. 
 
It&#x27;s about 5-10% prevalence i…</span>

We are looking for BT headphones, with possible noise cancellation and of course a quality mic for those endless days sitting on Teams. So far we have been giving out Jabras, Airpods, and other Bose headphones all based on need-for-use. 
 Got any good recommendations that would suit all our needs? What do you guys use? We have iOS as well as Android users.

                              <span>Following on from my previous query here, I&#x27;m having more problems with Failover Clustering VM resources that I can&#x27;t delete. u/BlackV please help me again :)
 I have a Hyper-V Failover Cluster managed by VMM where there are about 8 VMs that have &quot;disappeared&quot; from Hyper-V but at still listed in Failover Clustering. The Failover Clustering console shows them as &quot;offline&quot; and attempts to delete them fail with an error saying they are moving. The output of &#x60;Get-ClusterGroup&#x60; shows the group state as &#x60;Pending&#x60;. I don&#x27;t routinely manage this cluster anymore, so I don&#x27;t know the precise details of whatever happened over the weekend to trigger this odd state.
 The VMs still exist (the config is still on the disk) so I&#x27;m hoping I can remove the old VM registration in Failover Clustering, re-register the VM in place and add it back.
 Things I&#x27;ve tried:
  
Deleting the resource group in the Failover Clustering console - fails, information details says the request could not be accepted because the group is moving
 Deleting the child resource (i.e. the actual VM resource) in the Failover Clustering console - fails (sorry can&#x27;t remember the precise error for that one)
 Using the &#x60;DestroyGroup(...)&#x60; WMI method on the resource group - hangs
 Using the &#x60;DeleteResource(...)&#x60; WMI method on the child resources - hangs, but the child resource is marked as deleted, clustering still shows it however
  
Once again, I&#x27;m after any suggestions on how to clean this up without taking down the entire cluster.

 I work with a team of people who do live network analysis for on prem networks .
 We use the Rock NSM kit to ingest traffic and then analyze it . Our Rock KSM infrastructure is setup on physical hardware .
 Our customer wants us to do live analysis on traffic going into their virtual data center our customer has hosted by the cloud provider data center think (AWS) .
 We want to plug our physical router somewhere in the physical cloud provider data center and get all the traffic going in, out and around the virtual data center to make sure its secure in the physical data center .

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 We have a few networks that are through vWire. We recently experienced an issue with one of these networks where some the clients (static IPs) could no longer reach their gateway/Internet.
 Meanwhile, a different client on the same network was operating just fine and reaching its gateway/Internet.
 On our Nexus, we disabled the interface that was leading to the passive PAN. The issue was instantly resolved. We re-enabled the interface, experienced no issues for a few days only for the issue to return. LLDP is enabled in PAN for vWire if that helps.
 Any suggestions? I&#x27;d appreciate it, thanks!
 C9300, Stacked (between internal PAN and WAN PAN): interface TenGigabitEthernet1/1/6 description PA5430-1 vWire eth1/11 ae3 switchport trunk allowed vlan 61,96,180 switchport mode trunk interface TenGigabitEthernet2/1/6 description PA5430-2 vWire eth1/11 ae3 switchport trunk allowed vlan 61,96,180 switchport mode trunk Nexus 9K: interface Ethernet1/12 description PA5430-1 vWire eth1/12 ae4 switchport switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 61,96,180 speed 10000 no shutdown interface Ethernet1/12 description PA5430-2 vWire eth1/12 ae4 switchport switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 61,96,180 speed 10000 
 Edit:
 We&#x27;re currently using Aggregate Ethernet for vWire in PAN.
 vWire when using Aggregate Ethernet does not support LACP, just LLDP.
 We&#x27;re thinking of just removing AE to standalone links with LACP. Thoughts?

                              <span>Does anyone have any recommendations for a good label maker for marking cables, equipment, etc? I&#x27;ve found that our current label maker labels peel off of the cables after being in the server rack for a few weeks probably due to cheap adhesive.
 Cost isn&#x27;t really a concern. Thanks.

                              <span>Hi, I hope somebody can shed some light on a problem that I am observing. I have the above Nexus layer 3 switch with a 1G ethernet transceiver and a CATx cable around 20m length plugged to an HP laptop also with an onboard ethernet port, auto-speed/duplex at both ends. The problem is that despite both ends being logically active, the link reports as not connected, when both ends are then physically connected. Bring down and bring back up the port on the Laptop (Windows Networking disable/enable) everything springs into life. Same symptoms observed plugging into another network device, although in that case, no option exists to manually down/up the interface (cheap IP cam) Plug the same devices and the cable into another switch, different brand but same logical configuration - it all comes up first time. So to me it&#x27;s not the cable, and points to something on the Nexus. Nexus port config however is a really simple one;
 Interface eth1/27 switchport switchport access vlan 3 no shutdown 
 Has anybody seen this before, or could offer some clues on further diagnostic actions please?
 Ps already tried to post this in r/cisconetworking but apparently one has to be a trusted member..

                              <span>To my knowledge there are only 2 true Whitebox solutions available on the market if you want to run a switching solution over Whitebox switches and they are Pica8 and Sonic. I&#x27;m talking if you wanted to buy a Whitebox switching solution right now. It seems like there has to be more options than this. I&#x27;ll make the analogy of when IP devices exploded and your spreadsheet was no longer an option. 
 If you wanted something rock solid to manager your IPs you bought either Infoblox or Bluecat. If your environment was not too large you could get away with Solar Winds which at the time was more of a spreadsheet on steroids.
 Does any such Whitebox solution exist if I were to get some Edgecore switches?

 We are launching an app, on next js with a reverse proxy in between and i was looking for the best answer. This is the questing that i am asking
 How many connections per second/simultaneously my web would handle? is there a tool that measure it or put the web in stress mode? i would not expect to get the answer on this post, but i would like to know were to look or what is the best way to ask the question on google/overstack etc...
 Scalability? http request? 
 Thank you all for the help! 
 have a great week.

                              <span>I have a Cisco WLC wifi network. I&#x27;m using full endpoint isolation..
 I&#x27;d like to allow client-to-client connectivity, but only when the clients authenticated with the same credentials. For example, if UserA has a TV &amp; laptop both authenticated as &quot;UserA&quot;, I&#x27;d like UserA to be able to Chromecast from their laptop to TV. UserB would be able to ssh from UserB&#x27;s laptop to desktop, but not send anything to UserA&#x27;s devices. It seems like it would be a common requirement? 
 There are thousands of separate users, so manual per-user ACLs on the WLC are probably not going to work.

 ​
 Boss presented me with an interesting question - How can we be notified of an IP address conflict/duplicate IP on the network automatically?
 ​
 So, I wanted your input! What is your go-to method of detecting IP conflicts before problems arise? I&#x27;m sure I could script something up to scrape our ARP table on the edge-device and look for duplicates but hoping for something more graceful.

                              <span>Hello , 
 Currently we have an ISIS Adjacency between a CPE (Juniper) and 2 PEs (CISCO IOS XR) , however the link between the CPE and the Primary CPE (Primary Link) is suffering packet loss.
 Since the hello timer is big enough , ISIS does not detect a failure and hence packets are sent through that faulty link and many packets are lost.
 If we configured BFD with the ISIS , the ISIS adjacency will be flapping between the 2 links / PEs , which is something that we dont want to have.
 Is there anyway to solve this problem , for example to keep the ISIS cost on that link high , untill the link is guranteed to be stable and with no packet loss then it use that primary link ?
 I am open also for any other ideas.
 Thank You.

                              <span>Hi, my first time helping client optimize their network. They have a core L2/L3 with 3 L3 Meraki switches stacked. Did a firmware upgrade on the switches and their L3 routing went down. After reboots they were able to get it back up. They require a strategy to prevent this sort of disruption from occurring again. Any suggestions? Perhaps break it up into 2 stacks and have a controller switch connect them? Maybe install a backup core and run HSRP? Any help is appreciated, thanks

                              <span>Greetings!
 I own a lil ISP and I recently got approved from APNIC. Right now Im on the process of peering with my UPLINK and receive a full internet routes. Will there be any way I can identify the received internet routes with their domain name? My goal is to do PBR where all non facebook and google routes go to a different uplink. Ill be using an asr 9001 or probably an ISR 4451 to receive the full route and be the PBR router.
 Ive been using ibgp segment routing evpn and Im very familiar with it, but in the case of eBGP and route policies, super noob.
 Hope anyone can help!
 Thanks

                              <span>We are implementing traffic analyzer for our router and switches that send sflow logs. It would be great if you share your experience and the tech stack you have chosen or tested. Our main goal is to early detect DDoS attacks and run some script for BGP black holing or doing RTBH.

 120 km or 300 km with amps
 industrial or commercial temperature versions
 5 watts

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking into some MikroTik routers (CCR2116-12G-4S+) for my company. All other issues aside, what is the overall security like? I seem to see mixed reviews on this front. Are security issues caused by misconfiguration or is there a history of 0-day exploits and backdoors etc?
 Appreciate any help. Thank you

                              <span>Networking SME&#x27;s and enthusiasts!
 I am doing some research work to identify how carriers can better support their customers in providing improved network insights.
 Initially, this is specifically for P2P Dedicated/Private Ethernet Services (ie: sub10G, 10G, 100G international services), typically used for production networks and backbones.
 - Do you use Ethernet P2P (EPL) services and what for? 
 - What network statistics and reporting would help you run your networks?
 - How would you want such information presented (Portals? Reports? APIs?)
 - What problems would this help you solve?
 - What is one wish you had for your service provicer?
 Thanks in advance for your thoughts

                              <span>Hi. I am employed in quite big, global company as a data center senior network engineer. I have reached a top of my salary range, at least for a while and looking for additional employment in this field. What would be your recommendations for someone who would like to find a part time job in networking? I do deploy cisco nexus, catalyst and probably most importantly ACI fabrics including day to day support and tshoot. How would you steer your career to get additional weekend/evening job? There is not many part time offers, and I would prefer to not get fully OVER EMPLOYED as it brings too much risk for me in case someone finds out and I&#x27;d lose my primary job. What alternatives would allow me to get more $$ working in the same field after hours (flexible hours) and where to find these jobs as in 99% places is seeking for full time? Location UK. Thanks.

 If I understand correctly, Microsoft issued the original patch in June 2021, then re-issued the patch in June 2022, then again re-issued the patch in November 2022, and will again re-issue the patch in March 2023.
 I am trying to identify which version of the patch has been installed on a host today. Is the system running on the June 2021 version, the June 2022 version, or the November 2022 version - (and eventually, the March 2023 version).
 I have tried using WMIC and DISM queries, but these patches appear to be part of the cumulative monthly updates and aren&#x27;t individually listed.
 Hoping there is a DLL file version that can be checked... or something I am missing?
 Thanks!

                              <span>The only benefit I can see is that a user without admin rights can install something, given that any organization enforcing that would be running applocker or something similar and it won&#x27;t work anyway, whats the point?
 The downsides seem obvious and numerous, need to whitelist individual applications, like Microsoft Teams etc, lazy admins will just allow users to run anything, need to update the rules whenever an update is signed with a new certificate and the list goes on.
 Am I out of touch? No, it is the programmers who are wrong.

 Hi everyone. It’s been a while since the last blog post and I wanted up update everyone on what is going on. As many of you know already from a discussion on GitHub, Bryan and I have been laid-off from Intel in early November 2022. This was quite a surprise as MeshCentral, MeshCommander, MeshCMD and other tools where widely used. This said, Intel has been having poor financials and Bryan and I where part of a very large first wave of downsizing by the company that involved many people that I know and worked with for a long time.
 I had been working for Intel for over 25 years having started in September 1998. Over the years I worked on IPsec key negotiation, Universal Plug &amp; Play, DLNA and Intel® AMT. I loved working on all these projects and especially loved wo…</span>

                              <span>Hi Guys and gals,
 While doing our yearly phone system public holiday update I notice sysadmin appreciation day is not on the Fun Calendars of timeanddate.com but something like Ferris wheel day is !?!? Fun Holidays - Funny, Random &amp; Weird Holidays (timeanddate.com) 
 Would it be too much to ask r/sysadmin to lodge a quick feedback to get it added for greater exposure?
 Feedback on timeanddate.com 
 Of course, reasoning generated by chatGPT for quick copy paste.
 Hi Team,
 ​
 Timeanddate.com should consider adding System Administrator Appreciation Day to their fun calendars because it is an important day that recognizes the hard work and dedication of system administrators who play a critical role in keeping computer networks and systems running smoothly. By adding this day to their fun calendars, Timeanddate.com can help raise awareness and appreciation for the important work that system administrators do, while also providing a fun way for people to show their appreciation for these unsung heroes of the tech world. Additionally, this would be an opportunity for Timeanddate.com to attract a new audience of tech professionals and enthusiasts who are likely to be interested in this type of content.
 ​
 System Administrator Appreciation Day has been observed now for its 24th year with a dedicated website https://sysadminday.com/ and has been mentioned through several press yearly since 2001 please see: https://sysadminday.com/?page_id&#x3D;70 for press mentions.

                              <span>My organization is looking to expand internationally, specifically with marketing. There are plans to hire international employees as full time so I&#x27;ve been looking into onboarding via Autopilot, including purchasing equipment via CSP with localized keyboards and everything. I&#x27;ve lots to figure out there but it seems to cover all our needs. 
 However, I&#x27;ve got to think about offboarding in the future as well. I&#x27;m not against allowing folks to keep their equipment assuming we&#x27;re able to remotely wipe the device and the offboard is friendly. But for cases where the employee needs to surrender the device, I&#x27;d rather not ship equipment all over the planet. And even if we can get the equipment back, we won&#x27;t really have a need for laptops with non-qwerty keyboards.
 For those in similar setups, what&#x27;s your approach to dealing with decommissioned international devices that are used in ninch business cases like this?

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I&#x27;m trying to determine the best systems to use and wanted to get your opinions. 
 Current environment:
  
Employees: 70
 IT: 1 member
 Mixed environment - Windows/Mac computers (80/20) + Linux VMs. 
 Computers are not managed/domain-joined. 
 
 The majority of the business workloads reside on AWS. 
 Small on-prem footprint - local server for internal application/file server 
 File server is used to temporarily store files generated locally before it is then uploaded to AWS for processing. 
 
 Google workspace is used for email, storage, etc. 
 Currently using Google SSO to authenticate to other SaaS applications. 
 
 Microsoft 365 is also in place with similar licensing as Google Workspace. 
 Primarily used for office suite/collaboration via SharePoint. 
 
  
Ideally, I would like to tie everything to a single IDP and need a device to serve local DHCP (multiple VLANs)/DNS for internal resources. 
 I was leaning toward a hybrid environment since there is already some on-prem infrastructure so I was planning to spin up an AD environment off the same hardware. 
 Alternatively, I was considering a cloud-only environment leveraging AzureAD/Intune but in this scenario, I would want to migrate everyone off GW to M365 to take advantage of the additional features offered like conditional access, etc.
 The last option I am considering is JumpCloud. It seems to meet my requirements as far as a centralized directory, IDP, policies, and support for MacOS/Linux. But I never used this platform before so uncertain how it performs. 
 Any feedback is much appreciated. Thank you.

                              <span>FYI if you&#x27;re a Namecheap customer: I received an email to click a link and pay money from Namecheap. Header looks good, links are legit, passed SPF/DKIM/DMARC. Status update on Namecheap&#x27;s page show this: https://www.namecheap.com/status-updates/archives/74848 
 Looks like perhaps whatever provider they use to send marketing emails has been compromised.

                              <span>Helping a company with 80 users (windows laptops) that started using Crowdstrike Falcon + EDR + Overwatch a few months ago without knowing that Microsoft Defender for Business was included in their 365 Premium subscription. Now, I have nothing against Crowdstrike, its a great product, specially if you have Overwatch, however, it lacks on network protection and web filtering, and since this is a must have (in my opinion), the company needs to spend more money on a third party software (like dnsfilter for example).
 Since MS Defender for business is included in their license, I’m inclined to recommend them to make the switch from Crowdstrike to MS Defender for business. Then, with the money that is saved, buying dnsfilter (or other product) for an extra layer of protection , and invest more on security awareness training for the users and still save a lot of money!
 Would you do the same?
 P.S: I know Crowdstrike is a great product and security is not about saving money, but in this case I think we can actually improve their overall security by moving to defender.

 I am looking for a tool that I can install on my work Windows desktop to manage all the RDP connections that I make 
 Also, I hotdesk, so swap between different monitor sizes, types, and setups, including Ultrawide, so i want to standardise the resolution to open the same 1080p every time. 
 I really like the layout and GUI of Microsoft Store RDP app, but i can&#x27;t use it at work, also it is missing some basic functionality and tools (Eg, file sharing) 
 What do you guys recommend?

                              <span>So this particular day i leave early andour dept director mails me saying the dept central mail received a phishing email from one of the managers mails. (i dont know why these people aren&#x27;t taking this seriously)
 i tried contacting the manager but to no use... no answer to my phone calls and i ask the dept director what the mail was about, and he forwards the mail and i did some research and i found out from an overview graph that the sketchy link with numbers and shit leads to 2 end points, 1 of them is one drive and another to an IP.
 after this i mailed all our staff giving them a warning of the phishing campaign and asked them not to click on any links blindly.
 my question to you my fellow admins is what can i do or what would you do to prevent any of this from happening again... because the industry were in, we don&#x27;t want critical info leak and as the person in charge i think i should take responsibility even though no one is taking this serios and assess the situation and find a way to prevent it from happening again.
 what should i do? please help
 ​
 i was thinking of suggesting to run a GoPhish campaign, to give the staff a reality check by changing the passwords of the employees who fall it and then give a training on this.

                              <span>My wife works for a startup that developed a SAAS product used at trade shows. The startup also has about 30 iPads (and growing) that they rent out to clients. Between shows, the iPads have to be refreshed - wiped of any client data, wallpaper potentially updated (for white-label service), reset settings, update iOS, etc. The app the startup provides on the iPad is distributed via TestFlight and that too has to be updated. I have researched a lot of potential solutions for management software, but haven’t found any of them that specifically mention devices that are leant or rented out (and potential issues around that type of usage that the management software accommodates). Also, looks like none of them can update a TestFlight app. Looking for an affordable solution with intuitive management dashboard/interface. What are some of the best mdm options for this scenario? Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all,
 We&#x27;re a small, one building org. We want to use a NAC to identify endpoints connecting to the main VLAN. All users connect to the main VLAN. 
 Is there any reason why I couldn&#x27;t just use machine/computer authentication over Computer/User? Is there any downside of computer only?
 I get that someone could steal a domain laptop, but at the moment we&#x27;re not checking for that. We want to get 8021x embedded and working first before branching out to maybe different vlans and auth.

                              <span>Hi everyone, just started as an Infrastructure Engineer at a start-up of around 40 people. There&#x27;s no structure to anything, they use Workspace, 365, Dropbox, Slack, Zoom and probably more idk about yet. There&#x27;s no SSO, all accounts siloed, many of them just consumer accounts created by the staff themselves. Devices are both Mac and Windows, no MDM, AV, domain join etc. all local accounts with admin. 
 They&#x27;re looking to double staff count year on year so I need to get an IdP in place ASAP. For me this has always been AD, however I&#x27;ve never been somewhere this wasn&#x27;t already in place. What would people here recommend as an IdP for a small company with 1 IT person to manage it?
 Should I just go with AD? (Hybrid) or look at newer stuff like Okta and similar?
 It&#x27;s a R&amp;D company that&#x27;s entire existence relies on it&#x27;s internal research data, that currently any employee can easily walk out the door with. I&#x27;m coming from the legal sector where security, compliance and audits were very high priority and I/We had built out several layers to achieve this. Coming into this place, while I realise now is probably normal, gets my heart rate up.
 ​
 Appreciate any assistance!

 I mean its easy to find a backup software for my old MacOS High Sierra that says it &quot;encrypts and backup&quot;.But how do you trust this software that are often from one-man-companies or worst?It could be alot of backdoors or similar inside the hidden source code.
 This is the scenario right now:- Oh, how do I make a safe encrypted backup to Google Drive that is password protected?- &quot;ENTER YOUR PASSWORD HERE INSIDE THE APP&quot; trust me bro, everyone is using this app.
 Requirments of the software or solution:** Easy and simple to use. Not unnecessarily advanced.** Supported by MacOS High Sierra** Supported by icloud or google drive. (Get this free, no budget for expensive solutions).** …</span>

                              <span>I have no idea if this is the right forum for this question, but a group that I work with has been asked to set up a WIFI mesh network for a number of semi-permanent camps. The idea is to provide free wifi to roughly 60-100 sites (read homes) that will be equipped with a low-cost router enabling several family members to connect to.
 There&#x27;s been some back and forth on what equipment to use, but I was hoping that there was a best-practices standard that we could fall back on. Reliability, affordability, and ease of maintenance are the three top priorities (in that order) for this project. It will be really hard to service the APs and routers hooked up to the local fiber network that will be provided by a telco.
 The idea is to set up &quot;smart&quot; poles that will be used to mount the APs as well as all of the grounding equipment etc.
 Thanks again for any and all advice -- we will most likely need to contract this out but I wanted to check with this sub first just to get a general idea of min/max including projected costs.

                              <span>were in the midst of replacing a cisco switch with a dell switch. the cisco switch is currently connected to the core switch (Juniper) on the floor below it through a FC patch.
 when we connected the core switch (1st floor) with the dell switch (2nd floor) both switch doesnt link up. but when we brought the core switch to the second floor and connected via LC-LC cable without the interfloor patch board, both switches linked up so were thinking the patch board is at fault here.
 heres a few pattern that we tried
 Juniper Core(1st Floor) [LR/LC][SMF/SC] patch board [SMF/SC][LR/LC] Dell Switch (2nd Floor) &#x3D; No Link up
 Juniper Core(2nd Floor) [LR/LC][LR/LC] Dell Switch (2nd Floor) &#x3D; Link up
 Juniper Core(1st Floor) [UTP Port][UTP Port] patch board [UTP Port][UTP Port] Dell Switch (2nd Floor) &#x3D; Link up
 is there any other method we can connect the 10G thorough 2 floors? i dont know if the problem actually resides on the patch board aswell...worst case we might have to use a few UTP cable and create a LAG and maybe make it 2~4Gish
 any help is more than appreciated

                              <span>Hey folks. Looking to lab out some automation for ZTP on older devices that would need to go the auto install route.
 I don’t think this is something that I can do virtual - attempted on each, but can’t seem to get the devices to go through the right sequence with auto install.
 Has anyone else tried this successfully? Or am I chasing a dream that’s easier done with some physical hardware to supplement?

                              <span>I am trying to route two interfaces. The system is embedded, RTOS, uses Busybox&#x27;s &#x27;route&#x27; and runs a shell script during boot up. Following is my feeble attempt to route the subnets:
 TIMEOUT&#x3D;30
 /sbin/ifconfig eth1 up
 /sbin/ifconfig eth1 172.52.100.61 netmask 255.255.255.0
 /sbin/ifconfig eth0 up
 /sbin/ifconfig eth0 172.16.8.5 netmask 255.255.0.0
 /sbin/route add 172.16.0.0/16 via 172.17.254.254 default via 172.52.100.18
 When this is executed and I print the routing table I don&#x27;t see any gateways listed.

                              <span>I am having issues adding a device using SNMPv3. I have an old server setup and it’s out of date so I am needing to move to a new one that I have created. This new one is setup with an IP in the same range as the old one, both have a private network with the exact same up range. The old one will discover my devices via snmp and I can ping each individual device from the web console of it. The new one will not discover the devices, I enter they discovery info the exact same way as the old one and get nothing. This one will not ping the devices. Running a traceroute on the old server, it shows that it connects directly to the device in question. No other hops. Running a traceroute to the same device on the new one shows that it is going out to out ISP and so forth. 
 What could I be missing to enable this new server to talk to all of my APC devices. 
 From what I can see on all of my switches there is no routes or anything point these devices to the old server. It’s gotta be a routing issue somewhere right or am I missing something?

                              <span>hello, I acquired a HPE-1920 JG924A with the porpuse of learning about switch, routing etc 
 I am struggling with routing between VLAN
 ​
 I setup the following:
 - VLAN10 with ports 09, 10, 11, 12
 - VLAN20 with ports 13, 14, 15, 16
 - VLAN INTERFACE with IP 192.168.10.1 on VLAN10
 - VLAN INTERFACE with IP 192.168.20.1 on VLAN20 
 for the IPv4 Routing:
 ip route-static 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 Vlan-interface10 192.168.20.1
 ip route-static 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 Vlan-interface20 192.168.20.1
 ip route-static 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0 Vlan-interface10 192.168.10.1
 ip route-static 192.168.20.0 255.255.255.0 Vlan-interface20 192.168.10.1 
 but I still get &#x60;Destination Host Unreachable&#x60; when I ping hosts between VLAN 
 the config snipplet: 
 interface Vlan-interface10
 ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0 
 interface Vlan-interface20
 ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0

                              <span>We run a network that supports a manufacturing operation. It costs us $6000 / hr when the network isn&#x27;t running.
 We currently operate using a UDM Pro firewall and a PoE switch, security cameras, and two long-range access points, all from Unifi. Unfortunately, we keep having issues with reliability. Failed hardware and broken firmware updates have caused a lot of headaches over the past year.
 We are outgrowing Unifi hardware and need to upgrade to something with more reliability. People have recommended Ruckus for switches and access points, but I&#x27;m curious about other options.

                              <span>Is there a reason why a patch cable can fail and pass?
 Fluke&#x3D;Failed.
 Klein Scout 2 (7-8 years old)&#x3D;failed.
 Klein Scout 2 (6 years old)&#x3D;passed.
 Amazon $40 tester&#x3D;Passed.
 Actual Ubiquity switch into wall&#x3D;failed. 
 I was hoping my issue is that I have a cheap Amazon tester (I need to test a cable maybe once every three weeks). But the Klein&#x27;s couldn&#x27;t decide if it was good or not. I was set to buy the Klein Scout 3 before I asked a different tech where I work to verify the results with his tester. I pulled, bended, put on tension on the jack, and it would still pass.
 Can cables fit into a margin of error for testers? I know Klein tools have degraded in quality, have their testers done that as well (the passing Scout is younger than the one that failed it). Or why would testers not agree on this cable (5e, hand terminated on both ends)

 I&#x27;m looking for any information or material concerning software load balancers as applicable to hyperscalers.
 Particularly, anything relating to maglev or katran if possible. Information is scant but the software is out there in the open free for all to take a closer look.
 Obviously, not for production purposes. I haven&#x27;t completely lost my mind (yet...)
 Anybody can point me in the right direction?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello all, I’m really unsure if this is the correct place to ask, so if it isn’t, just let me know and I’ll move on :-)
 I have a project in mind that I’m unwilling to start until I get a second opinion. 
 Background: I have many USB devices each streaming sensor data at a very random, potentially very high rate. The current method of listening to these devices is to connect them all to a large hub and listen on whichever computer I’m using to record the data. Processing is done as data arrives, etc. This is manageable, but undesirable for a couple reasons:
  
Only one PC can listen at a time
 
To reduce bandwidth cost, the devices do not report human-readable data. Rather, the host is responsible for deserializing/parsing the data as it’s streamed though
 
 Solution: Have a single server computer dedicated to listening to the serial streams, parsing, then passing the stream to clients around the network in a more desirable format. Extending this, I suppose there could be multiple “sub” servers forwarding to a main server which distributes to whoever is listening, but I’m not going to bother with that at the moment. 
 My question(s) to you: 
  
Is this worth pursuing? At its core, all I’m doing is forwarding usb bits to the network and moving the parsing work to a different computer. At the moment, a single computer solution is working just fine, if annoying. 
 
Has anyone done anything like this? 
 
 Thank you!

                              <span>Howdy, 
 I&#x27;m currently working in a windows environment with ~16 separate offices that are connected via an SD-WAN. We have a vendor specific application with manages some of it&#x27;s printing thru a VPN to a print server for some of our printers, but individual PDF/document printing is managed via the machine itself. 
 We don&#x27;t currently have any sort of centralized print management. Leadership wants to avoid any sort of standard print server due to single-point-of-failure. But are there any solutions to manage the deployment of printer devices to machines while allowing windows clients to continue to manage individual print jobs? 
 We do currently use Connectwise Automate as an RMM and have it deployed acroos &gt;95% of the network, and a Hybrid Azure AD. I&#x27;ve seen mention of GPO by user OUs but a lot of our users move between locations. Are there machine bound solutions?

 At my company, the bosses want to run a phishing campaign on our users, using a realistic-looking Gitlab login page.
 I&#x27;ve been scouring the internet for any modern M365 login portal code, but to no avail. Every time someone has posted in e.g. GitHub the code of a nice login portal it&#x27;s almost instantly wiped...
 I would greatly appreciate any help on this! GoPhish seems like a fantastic tool, but without this functionality I&#x27;m no so sure of its use case for me. 
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m looking to all my fellow big brain sysadmins for ideas on a solution...
 I am in government sector IT and have a few areas in our jurisdictions which ISPs report meeting the FCC guidelines for broadband, however residents within those pockets complain of quality and speeds from that ISP. We&#x27;re looking to challenge the FCC maps to allow other providers to come in with infrastructure grants to complete fiber to the home for all homes in our jurisdiction which we have minus these cable provider pockets which providers hold the territory and only provide the bare minimum speeds to lock other providers out. 
 Okay... now for what I&#x27;m looking for....
 I&#x27;m looking for a hardware device which we can have residents plug into their service providers modem which will collect results on ping, jitter, downtimes, and run periodic speed tests.
 I&#x27;m thinking a PI or or Nuc which can run some software to do this... the question is... which software will do all of this for us?
 It can be any operating system, ideally be able to push reports back to us for us to challenge locations and ISPs faster and less purchase on our end as we can move devices faster.

                              <span>Messing around and I want to pull data from PG&amp;E about my gas usage. They say you need a &quot;valid client certificate&quot; for their webhook notification service. Normally I would buy a certificate from Comodo/Verisign or use Lets Encrypt for personal web sites, but other than using PKI services I am not too knowledgeable on how this works out side of a corp or business environment.  
 How does one get a &quot;valid client certificates&quot; ? 
 Alternately, can one purchase a intermediate cert of some kind to sign your own as needed so that they are then &quot;certificate issued by reputable certificate authorities &quot; ? IE. you have 10&#x27;s of devices.
 PG&amp;E currently supports only SHA-2 X.509 certificates issued by reputable certificate authorities (PG&amp;E does not accept self-signed certificates) Data requests and responses are made using the HTTPS protocol and are authenticated via a two-way certificate exchange with PG&amp;E, requests between you and PG&amp;E are over mutual SSL and require that you attach your client SSL certificate to your request.

                              <span>Hi all! We are running a product documentation portal using WordPress (not the best solution I know, but development time was essential) and IIS 10 on Windows Server 2022. Access to this portal is delegated by us, so nobody can register on his own. If a user wants to access the documentation files (pdf, zip, etc.), he must log in to the portal.
 All files are currently in the data/ folder which is in the root folder of the app that is also exposed by IIS on the internet. The data/ folder is custom made and not part of WP by default. The issue with this situation is that everybody that knows the folder name and filename can directly access it as an anonymous user, which is a security risk (for instance, if our domain is example.com, you can navigate to example.com/data/sample.pdf and download the file without logging in).
 Is there a solution on how to set it up in the web.config or some setting in IIS that you can prevent that behavior? I&#x27;d like that only users logged into the WP portal can download the files.
 I thought about moving the data/ folder from the app root folder into a folder that is not directly exposed by IIS, but I believe that WordPress would have huge problems accessing that files.
 Edit: I believe IIS (and not WP) is allowing anonymous users to download the files in the data/ folder as it is exposed to the internet. The general idea I&#x27;m currently looking at is how to tell IIS which user is authenticated by WP and which is not? Maybe by looking at a Cookie or something?

 What we do today:
 Today, we have an internal company website that employees go to and fill out a web form with a drop down list of possible issues. Depending on what they select as their main issue it may prompt them with a secondary drop down list of more specific issues. For example, Main issue &#x3D; &quot;Email&quot; then a more specific issue list would contain &quot;Distribution list change&quot;. There is of course a text entry field where they describe their issue further, a severity 1, 2, 3 drop down list, and then then a SUBMIT button. This triggers a case to be created in our ticketing system where users then will be…</span>

I know enough to be dangerous with ISE (of which I&#x27;m basically our only admin), but I don&#x27;t have a solid understanding of how these processes actually work.
 Does anyone have any good resources (written, pictures, videos all fine) to help me gain a better understanding?

Captive portal for login
 
Bulk addition and deletion of users
 
Logging - User logon &amp; logoff times, browsing history, which access point the user is accessing from &amp; the amount of data consumed by each user.
 
Set a data limit for each user
 
 I was looking into using pfsense to create the captive portal and using freeRADIUS to handle the user database. I would like your suggestions on which tools would be best suited to accomplish these 2 goals. 
 Is it possible to do this without 802.1X access points since the current access points don&#x27;t support that?
 Kindly provide your advice/suggestions. Thank you.

                              <span>I just completed renaming our domain controllers domain name using rendom. However after, I realized that none of the DNS records in the original forwarding lookup zone (FLZ) changed. They were still all under the old FLZ. I can only assume that migration of these records was not apart of the process of rendom (is that true?)
 If so I am trying to use a powershell script to migrate from one FLZ to the new FLZ. This worked, and I converted all the PTR records as well with powershell. 
 The question is, is this what I should be doing to migrate to the new FLZ after rendom?

 I’ve been job hunting unsuccessfully for months, eventually giving up hope on finding anything that I was actually going to be excited about. I had come to terms with needing to accept anything I could just to survive, and was applying to call centers and help desks again. 
 But then this job came around and it fits my skills and experience perfectly and I’m actually really happy and grateful and excited…! I can’t wait to get started! 
 And I’m so relieved to be done job hunting. It’s been a nightmare.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been doing SNMP metrics collection for 20 years now with a modified MRTG setup that in addition to storing the data in native RRD files also sends the data to a TSDB which is then fronted by a heavily automated Grafana instance. Now that the world is very slowly moving away from SNMP and towards metrics via REST API and streaming telemetry (Cisco MDT for example) I am starting to research paid metrics collector suites like SolarWinds, PRTG, Zabbix, etc. So far I&#x27;m unimpressed with SolarWinds in that it is still using a classic SQL DB for metrics storage instead of a modern TSDB approach. I also don&#x27;t like the fact that the data is more or less locked in SW - I need to be able to stream a copy of it as close to real time as possible for analysis in other platforms (think a TSDB with ML components). 
 Bonus points for netflow collector and analysis discussion too.

 We just bought the Java licensing we needed last year for about 3k (only about 30 installs on desktops )under their new pricing model this would now cost us about 350k (still 30 installs but need to count total users which is about 3000)
 Oracle has already started reaching out to us about this change. If this is all true they have just given me every reason to do everything I can to rip Java out. We already try to use openJDK or MS’s version of Java, unfortunately there are some tools that just don’t work with them.

                              <span>We often enough have users leave the company then return. I suspect there is some kind of leftovers preventing a profile from being recreated on the same device. It&#x27;s only an issue for our pooled PCs having multiple users because we can reset Windows in between. Profile works fine on a newer shared unit that didn&#x27;t exist during user&#x27;s previous employment.
 EDIT: Yes, user was signed into a Temp profile. I have just tried renaming/removing &quot;.bak&quot; in the ProfileList, and settings State and RefCount both to 0, and restarted. Upon attempted login, it did the same again - only logging into a Temp profile.

                              <span>Hey guys, wanted to get your option between Teams and Slack. Personally I like Teams I find it’s easy to a manage, easy to collaborate and it all integrates with Outlook. It I have found some resistance from my company making the switch. Although I don’t really mind if people use both, I’m just wondering from a different perspective what is so great about Slack? And what does your company use

                              <span>Hey Everyone,
 I&#x27;m trying to find a good &quot;Change Tracking&quot; system, not management. As in, I don&#x27;t need an approval process and advanced workflow system. This is for myself and one tech, all of the final changes are passed through me, but I am looking for something free, basic and cloud based if possible.
 Ideally it would have the ability to add devices or software applications, and tie a &quot;Date&quot;, change made with notes/attachment to each item. With basic search capability, keyword, date, device, etc.
 I&#x27;ve looked at and demoed Jira Service Management, and the Atlassian products. While this looks like an amazing product for an enterprise wide management/control/service desk system, it is way too much for our needs.
 I&#x27;m not opposed to something self hosted with PHP/MySQL either, but am not looking for anything NIX based.
 The purpose of this is to be able to fall back on the info if something else is affected later on, or we run into the issue or similar issue again.

                              <span>Hi there. Here´s the deal. I&#x27;ve got an ERP running on a Win 2k8 R2 (bare metal), leagacy, inherited (new customer). I need an image to virtualize that, currently is a time bomb. I can&#x27;t restart it, because no one can assurre it will be back. It has an uptime of almost 400 days.
 Tried installing Veeam, but... two things, It ask for a restart, and... I HAVE NO VOLUME SHADOW COPY.
 The machine runs an MS SQL server with a ERP. Do you guys know a way to do this? No VSS, No restart.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Like the subject says - I have 3 physical servers with dozens of TB&#x27;s of data and growing.
 One server gets the new/modified data and I&#x27;d like the two child servers to sync data from the parent one automatically - Ideally I&#x27;d like the storage to be mirrored, i.e. I want deleted files on the parent storage server to be deleted on the child servers as well.
 What solution should I be looking for? FTP with scheduled transfers? If so, what client supports mirroring of the file structure as well as bandwidth control/scheduling?
 All servers are running WS2019/WS2022 and there are no DB&#x27;s or VM&#x27;s that are being copied. Client solution preferred over scripting.

 Leaving a comfy job that is on the downward due to age of owner for a company that is growing if I get it.
 I&#x27;m not nervous of my ability just of course will be nervous being questioned for things I can&#x27;t anticipate in advance.
 I&#x27;ve found the company has no DMARC, DKIM setup so thinking of bringing this in for a quick win on a report.
 Any advice for a rusty old see dog trying to do better for himself and his family?

                              <span>Some time ago I made the switch to another company: less hours, better pay, shorter commute - all really nice things. But what I appreciate the most is how my new manager treats us: I had to do an upgrade for a business critical application (we talk multiple millions in revenue just from this application per week) after hours. It was scheduled to start at 5.45pm, but at 5.30 I got a call &quot;we need till&quot; 6pm. Ok, no problem. But you know how it turned out... At 7.30pm I finally could start to shut down the running services. Unfortunately the installation routine runs for up to 60 minutes, even if it fails. So of course this happened multiple times and after some digging around in the log files and doing multiple steps manually that should run automatically, I was finished at around 1.30 in the morning.
 I informed my manager the next day (back at work at 8am) and his response was &quot;First: Next time just tell them you will not start after the agreed upon time. It&#x27;s our job to make sure this stuff works, but we are not responsible if they can&#x27;t finish their work in time. Second: if something like this happens again, feel free to call me for support. I am usually awake till 2am anyways so just give me a call! Third: Go home and sleep - if you work longer hours, just come in later so you can get enough rest&quot;.
 Feeling the support of the people above me and knowing they will stand up for me and help is worth much more than all the things that made me switch jobs in the first place. For the first time in the last two years I enjoy my work again.
 And yes, I did take him by his word the next time something didn&#x27;t go right: at 10pm I called him. He tried to help me figure it out and at 11 told me &quot;I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s wrong. You can stop now, I will take over“.

                              <span>HI, I work in a small forest equipment manufacturing company and we looking kind of CMDB/Asset management software but for to manufactured products. Preferable open source but reasonably priced (max 1000€ per year). There would be about 10-15 users.
 ​
 Basically we need able
  
to track all out product via serial number (or tag), find all related product
 add maintenance/change event to product
 find all product with certain attributes/value to send service bulletin to customers
 see product delivery date, warranty, options, change history of product
  
​
 Delivered product set could be like
 The broadest set of product
  
base machine
 crane
 harvester head
 measuring devices
 computer
  
Or single product
  
energy wood head
  
​
 I have looked asset managements software but al most every one is related to IT (Datacenter, racks, Networks, Computers, etc,). Is there general software where we can define product types/categories and dependable product and also customers?
 And yes, there is PDM but we looking more lightweight solution.
 Any hints where to look?

                              <span>Hi guys
 I have an openvpn server set up on an Amazon Lightsail instance (London, UK) which to date, for the years I have been based in the UK, has worked flawlessly as my personal VPN, and has had a negligible impact on my download speeds.
 However, since recently moving to South East Asia, connecting through the same VPN is absolutely killing my internet speeds. This is a little surprising, as I understood that greater geographic distance from the server would increase &#x27;ping&#x27; times, but actual download speeds should remain mostly unaffected?
 I am generally seeing speed test results that show connection speeds of ~40mb/s through public wifi networks being reduced to somewhere around ~4mb/s-- 10% of the actual underlying connection speed!
 I am looking at setting up another Lightsail instance in Singapore and cloning my OpenVPN files onto it. But I wonder if anyone can comment on why this is happening; is this at all as surprising to you guys as it was to me?

                              <span>This might be a very strange question for this sub but I think people who automate things and have technical minds (this sub) propably were in a situation like this in their careers so they might have experience in this.
 I work for logistical company and I have noticed that one work process which the operators reapeat over 1000 times a day can be done much more effectively by using the full capabilities of already provided HW. I am sure I can improve the efficiency on this process by 10-20%. I have even tried configuring the HW in a proper way in test enviroment. It works, now I just need to implement it which is quite simple.
 Since the business will now have a great improvement in this process these operator positions will be much more profitable. Shouldn&#x27;t I receive atleast some one time bonus for the extra effort I put in this?
 BTW: I won&#x27;t make the process easier for the workers, if that was the case I wouldn&#x27;t be asking the question and just implemented it. It just improves their efficiency.
 The though of receiveng a bonus can&#x27;t leave my mind since monday and the moment I realised I can do 5 step task in 3 steps.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently entered an org with a number of Windows servers, and have been trying to get our licensing in compliance and holy fucking shit, why the hell is Windows Server licensed like this? Per core licensing because fuck you, a Standard license (for the entire VM host) only allows two VMs, but a Datacenter license costs an arm and a leg. Even with non profit discounts, we end up paying $4400 to license three physical servers that can only run two VMs each (and the physical hardware is running ESXi), just to have the privilege of working with broken software. What&#x27;s that? You want to separate out server roles, keep things more separate, without worrying about re-licensing the same hardware twenty times? Same environment, 25K. For Windows Server. I hate monopolies.

                              <span>Hey everyone - We have two independent multicast networks experiencing this issue. An iTV VLAN and an AV/Crestron VLAN. We did not have this issue until we implemented a pair of internal PA5430 firewalls. The PAN now holds our Layer3 SVIs.
 Diagram: https://i.imgur.com/QrPBzUh.png
 Whenever a network distribution switch carrying these two VLANs comes online, be it a reboot or interface being unplugged/plugged in, the resulting STP TCN would cause a brief Multicast flood and disturb the devices on it. 
 The TV&#x27;s would flicker for the length of the &#x27;TCN Flood Query Count 1&#x27; (10 seconds) and some of the AV/Crestron devices would lose connection to their respective processors and would not reconnect automatically (Crestron devices are terrible at any network blips, but that&#x27;s a whole other top…</span>

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m hoping that someone could enlighten me and answer my question about Inbound NAT rules. :)
 If the customer has an Inbound NAT rules on their Firewall in their current design, where is the best place to put the VeloCloud? Infront (VeloCloud facing the ATT WAN /30) or at the back of the Firewall (Firewall Facing the ATT WAN /30). There&#x27;s an ATT /29 LAN Block for their Inbound NAT rules. 
 Current Design:
 AT&amp;T /30 --&gt; AT&amp;T Router --&gt; CPE FW (with old /29 Inbound NATs) 
 Proposed Design:
 AT&amp;T New /30 --&gt; VeloCloud (with New /29 Inbound NATs) --&gt; CPE FW
 (Note: Connection between VeloCloud and CPE FW will be transit network /30 and would request them to point all traffic/default route to the VeloCloud)

                              <span>Somwthing strange happened and I am just starting out my journey as a networking emgineer so I am.not quite sure how it happened. I got a new Internet connection from ISP A and they installed the Wi-Fi router. I changed its name to &#x27;WIFI A&#x27; and pw to &#x27;PASS1&#x27;(router access). My family was out of the country, and I had manually connected only 2 devices of mine to that newly installed Wi-Fi. But when they came back all of their devices got connected automatically without the need of entering a password. This is something new for me. One important thing to mention, we have a home in another city and its wifi name and password are the same but the device and the ISP are different. Is it possible that the devices knows the Wi-Fi router through its name not their MAC? And when it scanned for a Wi-Fi it got authenticated?

                              <span>So we are going to remove our line interactive UPSes on the second supply side of our racks and provide them with straight utility power to save a little bit of power (I guess battery chargers are energy hogs or something). I tried to say this was as a bad idea and I was told that the generator will only take a few seconds to power up. My first thought was about power stability but apparently the electrical engineers have no problem providing 80 volts to 160 volts and that supply should just work fine. 
 My opinion is not even being considered so I&#x27;m just going to do it despite my objections. I feel like this is begging for problems.
 I think this is a horrible idea but I have been tasked to remove the redundant UPSes to save on maintenance costs because utility power is good enough!!
 So how does everyone feel about this assessment. Is it worth it to loose a layer of redundancy for a couple hundred dollars a month?
 Edit readability.

                              <span>Let me start out with a little about me and my IT history. I am a woman in IT and I have about 25 years IT experience. I started out doing basic desktop support and worked my way up to high level systems administration. I recently left (last April) a 22 year job for a new company. I am very happy at the new company and the actual job and environment is great, that is not my rant. 
 Today I was troubleshooting a very odd printing issue for a customer. I help do last level tech support for Financial and HR software (server support). This was direct deposit stubs printing issue so it was a big deal. The stubs were printing 2 letters of the check info over the perforation. As a side note I have 17 years of supporting this application and server configuration at my previous job as 3rd level sup…</span>

 Are there free cheap solutions to accomplish this coming up in the past year?

 I restored both, I see ad, I see all seems well on gui side of server.
 When I run repadmin /replsummary on dc2, it says rpc server unavailable for dc2 (itself), but to the other dc (fsmo holder) all is fine.
 Any ideas where to start?

                              <span>I can&#x27;t decide what certs and path I want to go into. I love the help desk, so I was thinking of MS modern desktop cert so it semi gives me better knowledge of deploying computers from the sccm/azure side of things 
 But I want something more, something that lands me in the 90k+/ yr salary, but doesn&#x27;t force me to put in 50+ hrs a week. I prefer life than work.
 The issue is, I&#x27;m the main breadwinner of a house of 4. Wife works but doesn&#x27;t make 20k a year. 2 teens who literally feast like Kirby. So I&#x27;m always living paycheck to paycheck at 65k .
 Current job is help desk but we&#x27;re so limited to do shit, it feels like a govt contractor t1. Can&#x27;t create an ad account, many things go to admins that in any other job I did, I could do. 
 I&#x27;m thankful I have a job, but I also sense they want me gone as I haven&#x27;t had benefits kick in post trial period. Haven&#x27;t rocked that boat because I don&#x27;t want to be unemployed no certs guy.
 Ps: before you ask why no certs, I&#x27;ve always worked 80+ hrs weeks doing IT and instacart type shit. 7 days a week just to make ends meet. Still do.

                              <span>Reaching out to my other sysadmins and maybe more specifically to those that do hardware support for Mac users. The owner of a company has asked for a dual monitor setup to companion with his 2019 16&quot; MBP he has. Long and short he liked walking into one of our offices and seeing how we had 4 monitors up on a stand all to the same PC and wanted some of that screen real estate goodness.
 I am currently stuck though, maybe because not a single person on the team is an &quot;Apple guy&quot; or something, but I have yet to find a Mac dock that does dual independent display (no mirroring) but also supports both Intel and the newer M1/M2 MBPs. The best looking ones currently we could find we&#x27;re from Anker in the 775 and the OWC docks but those required thunderbolt to DP or HDMI converters too for the 2k resolution screens (TB displays aren&#x27;t priced well compared to DP / HDMI ones).

                              <span>I worked on ERP software at two separate businesses that was published by one of the largest software vendors in the world. That crap hasn&#x27;t changed in any fundamental way since the 50s, no joke. They kept adding &quot;modules&quot; that you had to pay for which supposedly gave the software new functionality. In reality, they were user requested changes to code that didn&#x27;t work correctly in the first place. Companies were literally paying even more money for upgrades and updates that should have been provided by the vendor. The software was so error prone and full of bugs it made me shiver with rage every time we paid the maintenance agreement.
 The money they burned trying to keep that shit marginally functional was appalling. Support was sold to overseas call centers which made even the most mundane issue a days long slog. They would always promise big new changes were coming and year after year they would dole out a new sliver that made the software slightly more usable than before, for a price. It was just a glorified DB with no real higher functionality. Data mining was an arduous manual process with no tools etc. to facilitate. It relied heavily on external tools for basic use including a gawd awful java interface that barely functioned. 
 It was slow, clunky, and contained NO automation of basic daily tasks. I invented multiple ways to mine what we needed and analyze millions of records for pertinent data. The lack of even basic input checks meant people were entering erroneous data on the regular that needed to be pruned, edited, or replaced. It became my full time job just keeping the wheels on. I will never work for another business that uses that crap as long as I live.

                              <span>My company just cut a few thousand jobs. Today at 40 minutes before the end of my shift I was asked to take a Sev 1 call. I explained that I have plans , ( I am the driver for my daughter and her friends to go to a school dance). I asked him “can you PROMISE ME that at 5 I can get a hand off?” He said “I can’t.” So I said “sorry then neither can I.”
 Feels great man

                              <span>So I&#x27;m a sys engineer at a dental lab. We use ups worldship with crossware right now. It reads and writes case info to a local mssql database to pull in each shipment&#x27;s info and to write a tracking number to the case in the DB.
 We ship a lot, 350+ packages a business day easily
 Anyone that has dealt with worldship, knows it doesn&#x27;t scale well to this volume, but I&#x27;ve made it work through weekly db maintenance on the admin and various tweaks etc. So yes it works, but it&#x27;s the kinda free program that isn&#x27;t really free and when there&#x27;s a problem their support is useless and one of the IT team has to stay late.
 So I&#x27;m wondering if anyone here has a shipping platform they like that can do all these things. Cloud and web based would be amazing as long as they can pull up the shipment info by scanning an invoice, plop it on the usb scale, hit a button and then it prints on a networked label printer. We are currently in one building, but we are outgrowing it, so the quick scalability of a browser based cloud app is desirable. I imagine the ui would be more modern than the xp/Vista asthetic of worldship too.
 We&#x27;ve looked into a few, like shiprush for example but, while they would work, they seem geared more towards Ecommerce orders and the onprem sql integrations are an after thought.
 So anyone here have recommendations for a shipping platform geared more towards manufacturing enterprises?
 Thanks friends!

                              <span>I am a devops engineer/operations teammember. This week I had a meeting with someone from a different department. Lets call them R&amp;D. They developed a PoC for a new service to pilot to our costumers. Their department is no software development team at all. They hired a developer from somewhere to develop this project.
 Our team in the company is rather small. 20 IT professionals in all. This includes frontend devs, backend devs, product owner, test manager/QA specialist and operations. We work a load that requires a much larger team (same story everywhere I suppose ;-) ). 
 This PoC of the R&amp;D department needs to go to production for a pilot run. In this meeting I asked if they had a test suite, they didn&#x27;t. I asked if they atleast had unit tests, they didn&#x27;t. I asked who would be responsi…</span>

                              <span>Hello !
 My boss says it’s vital that every admin who makes an action on the information system (servers, firewalls, switchs…) write every one of them on an excel file for example. He says that when we have a problem, we can look into it if someone made a change that could be the trigger.
 Is it just me or is it a complete waste of time ? Because when there’s a problem, I track it to the root to be 100% sure. Of course, I write down commands sometimes when they’re complex and I make documentation for me or my colleagues.
 What do you think ? Do you have to do it in your jobs or did you ? If some does it, which software do you use ?
 Thank you !
 Edit : we already do CAB every week where we discuss every change, plan the action and the rollback plan, etc…

                              <span>This has been one hell of a week. Monday, find out the network team has completely cut out our content gateway appliance to fix network issues. Which, hey, people need the internet and due to turn over and knowledge rot...okay. They just didn&#x27;t tell us they were going to do that.
 Tuesday, a close partner company had an email account compromised and phished us. Forty people clicked the link. Whee remediation.
 Wednesday, that new method of spreading Qakbot and similar via one note attachments sent to old email chains that bleeping computer did a story about Tuesday bit us. Junior admin released the wrong email to a user, who apparently opens everything she gets ever. This was a baaaaaaaad how in the hell do you fall for this email. &quot;Here&#x27;s what you asked for, please see the attached document&quot; with an email thread from two years ago below it. Fortunately, Microsoft Defender caught it and quarantined after she downloaded, opened, and tried to let it download the malware. My team kicks ass, we had it contained within ten minutes of the alert, then two hours to track down what the hell happened.
 Thursday, all is quiet. Time to focus on new direct reports, and put together a write up of Wednesday.
 Friday. Government agency that we have a required training with apparently glitches, and sends out a massive email blast to anyone who&#x27;s taken any training from them about a &quot;training booster 1 of 3&quot; that looks like a phish but...nope. It&#x27;s legit. With a sketchy office survey form. Queue our phishing inbox being flooded with 600+ emails. But at least my users are paying attention?
 I am very thankful it&#x27;s Friday, and I&#x27;m not on call.

                              <span>I work for a small business with &lt;25 users distributed technically in 3 offices. We already had random issues with SSL VPN that worsened lately and now a previously fine IPsec tunnel broke down.. No matter how I redo our networks, re-create firewall and NAT rules the number of issues and bugs I run into just increases. The painfully slow hydra makes the already time consuming troubleshooting worse..
 The good thing I just learn that we are not tied to Sophos even if our licenses are still valid for some more time. 
 I&#x27;m free to choose new product(s), get these devices nuked and re-architect our network infrastructure. So here I am starting my weekend with researching alternatives

Zendesk saying that the &quot;internal note&quot; when someone replies to a ticket via email is expected behavior, then pointing me to an article which isn&#x27;t accurate for the problem I described at all. Also it shouldn&#x27;t be expected behavior. Before &quot;internal note&quot; meant it was a note between agents. So cool of them to say what is essentially a bug is a new.. feature?
 
This is outside of the timeline but I had an absolute hell of a time getting Zendesk to understand what a damned JSON token was. In the end we solved it on our side with no help from them at all.
 
Okta failing to see an app I reported as no longer working was in their app catalogue and also apparently their support can&#x27;t access Paychex from wherever in the world they are, so they have to do remote sessions with…</span>

 Windows 3.1, ram and hard drives measured in megabytes, phone lines, fax machines, pbx&#x27;s, modems and BBS&#x27;s, ISDN (if you could afford it), all of it.

Well, I have 3 I&#x27;ve been dealing with since I joined this place a few years ago. 
 It began with a cold call from a recruiter late 2019. I always say it&#x27;s worth discussing opportunities, even if I am not looking to move. Who knows, maybe I might actually be interested in what they are selling. This turned out to be the case for this one, it was in line with my skill set, at a very stable company that I could easily retire from. I am a due diligence doer, so I met with the recruiter in person (also to get that free lunch) and we talked ove…</span>

                              <span>The water cooler is right by my desk. It&#x27;s currently not operational(someone is coming to fix it) So I put a sticky note that says &quot;Out of Order&quot; COVERING the water dispense button. I just watched someone in the office PUSH the out of order sticker to get to the button behind it, completely crumpling the sticky note, and be surprised there was no water.
 That might be better than any ticket I get in my career.

 I&#x27;m aware for the online version of powerpoint, with the more expensive licenses, you can make company wide templates available. I&#x27;m struggling to find a solution for the desktop apps on Windows/Mac. Has anyone found a useful service/software to do this?

                              <span>Kind of an interesting scenario. An end user that was let go from the company still has their corporate laptop. It has not connected to the domain controllers or VPN since their departure.
 Their Active Directory user has been disabled, but the endpoint hasn’t phoned home in some time. This allows them to log in to the computer, likely using cached credentials.
 Is there a way to remove their access to this computer remotely? We might not have access to run remote commands through the network to their computer (PowerShell, Command Prompt, etc.) but may be able to run similar commands through TeamViewer.

                              <span>Recently, my boss asked me about the possibility to put a VIP shared between two DNS Servers, so when one is down the other one takes on the virtual ip and start responding. 
 His idea is to provide some high availability when one dns server gets down. I really don&#x27;t know if it makes much sense as we can set preferred and alternative dns servers. I saw here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/it-pro/windows-server-2012-r2-and-2012/dn593685(v&#x3D;ws.11)#dns-client-resolver-behavior#dns-client-resolver-behavior) that a windows machine will take 1 second to forward the lookup to the alternative dns server, I guess a VIP will take more time to pass to the other server.
 Any thoughts?

                              <span>I have a simple Computer Chrome policy that installs a couple of add-ons. This policy works for 95% of our domain. There are a few computers that randomly lose the GPO, thus uninstalling the add-ons. A GPRESULT shows the GPO is not applied. Once I GPUPDATE /FORCE, the policy is applied and add-ons installed for a period of time(weeks) before once again, GPO is missing. These computers are in the same OU as computers that are working. I&#x27;ve checked AD replication and all is well. I&#x27;ve tried recreating the GPO and the same computers issue persists. I&#x27;m at wits end, so here I am reaching out to reddit for help! Beer coupon for anyone that can lead me in the right direction to resolve this issue.

                              <span>Hi everyone. I am looking for a solution to automate the process of onboarding new users (and maybe even for offboarding tasks if possible). At the moment this is the flow of tasks:
 - HR is opening a ticket with the new user&#x27;s details (name, position, department, manager, mobile phone number);
 - we&#x27;re creating a Office365 mailbox via the on-premise Exchange cp (it&#x27;s a hybrid environment) and that creates the AD user;
 - we add the details on the user&#x27;s AD profile (all of the above, they are used for dynamic group membership mostly);
 - the user is synced to AAD;
 - we assign the O365 licenses as needed.
 Obviously, there&#x27;s also the task of preparing the laptop, joining it to AD and Intune and install specific apps on it, but that&#x27;s another discussion I believe, right now I want to focus on the other tasks that I mentioned.
 So, any of you have some ideas on how can this be automated? I know that there are HR apps that integrate with AD and could maybe do what we need, but I have no experience on this, I wouldn&#x27;t know where to begin...
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi everyone! I find myself in a good position to be in, which is, I can choose whether to stay at my current job and possibly earn more in the following months, or switch now to a place where I&#x27;d make about 30% more. I&#x27;ve been at my current company for almost 5 years now, and it is my first IT job. I started as an intern in 2018, and became a full time employee in 2020. I&#x27;ve been job seeking for a few months now, and have refused two other offers, but this one sounds so good it&#x27;s hard to not think about doing it. The thing is, I feel so bad about it. 
 The company I work at started very small. I was one of four people working there at the beginning, and now we&#x27;re almost 20. I&#x27;ve seen it (and helped) grow from a very small fintech to being bought by a billion dollar corporation. It is curre…</span>

                              <span>Hi All,
 I&#x27;m seeing a lot of posts recently about sys admins values etc, a lot of them seem to be in fairly similar boats to me (small on site teams for a few hundred users) and they&#x27;re saying they&#x27;re on $60k+. I&#x27;m in the UK so of course the conversion rate plays a increasingly smaller factor in that, but I earn nowhere near that.
 It&#x27;s highly likely that these sys admins do a lot more than me, but it got me thinking... What do you sys admins actually do in a fairly regular day to day? I&#x27;m hoping it might give me some ideas of what I want to do/what to expect as I further my career. I wouldn&#x27;t mind being on 60K either!

 My agency just mandated that we move away from the usual SCAP scanner and implement a Navy-written tool called &quot;Eval-STIG&quot;. Eval-STIG uses answer files to provide justification for &quot;Open&quot; and &quot;Not Reviewed&quot; items, but the format of that file is bewildering to me. Rather than using previous STIG-generated checklists, it uses a custom XML file to provide those status overrides.
 Is there a document or anything that anyone can point to for me that explains the formatting and correct usage of the XML fields in that answer file?

 I messed up big time. I put in the password and forgot it on my MacBook Pro. It has M2 chip if it&#x27;s relevant. It is mu 2nd day at work. No experience with mac. I before forgetting the password i also removed admin access to any other accounts. It is my work laptop and i shouldn&#x27;t have done that. When going for a reset it asks for filevault key. How do I find it? I have logged in to apple ID. Please help me. Tomorrow and day after is week off.

                              <span>Hello everyone, sysadmin in training here. As title says some of my users have been functionning in a very strange way. They have a shared mailbox which they CC on every mail they send. Team of 5, huge flow of mail. The result is 16k mails in 6 months, our plan allows for 50Gb of mails and it&#x27;s already full. The apparent reasoning behind this is to allow anyone to access every conversation with clients should one of them be out of the office.
 Good Idea, bad execution they think mail storage is unlimited, and they don&#x27;t want to delete old mails &quot;in case&quot;, for now I set up an automatic archive but it&#x27;s really slow and they&#x27;ve been complaining for a few days, some have the same problem on their own adresses. They&#x27;re moving the mails manually from Inbox to the archive but that&#x27;s just delaying the inevitable because the archive has a 50Gb max capacity.
 How can I solve this ? Anyone ever had this kind of situation?
 Thanks a ton, been learning a lot on this subreddit already!

 ​
 I am wondering: is it possible to leverage Microsoft Endpoint Manager is I want to find out how many machines have a certain file present on them? E.g. I would like to know how many machines have the following file c:\Program Files (X86)\Microsoft Office\abacus.exe 
 ​
 Thanks for helping me out with my question :)

                              <span>Hello There. I have a client that i have never worked with before that has asked me to advise them on modernising their IdP. They currently have a combination of Active Directory, synching to AzureAD, but using ADFS for Auth. In addition to using ADFS for 365 authentication, they are also using several other applications (box.com for example) as well as using LDAP against the on-prem for some on-prem apps.
 They are eager to move to AzureAD (or another cloud IdP) to remove dependency on On-Prem.
 My thinking is that each app that uses ADFS is going to be handled differently. And that each one needs to be &quot;cutover&quot;, there is unlikely to be any way to stage or transition from one Identity source to another.
 For 365 and Sharepoint and other MS Apps, i plan to recommend using Staged Mode, as they have some automation and workflows that have the expected ADFS webpage hard coded into their authentication, so i will leave the identitites used there in ADFS until they are &quot;dev&#x27;d&quot; out.
 Staging mode should in no way affect the third party apps, am i correct?
 My method is along the lines of 
 Enable PHS in ADConnect &amp; Seamless SSO -&gt; Enable Staging Mode -&gt; Migrate majority of Human Users to Staging Group (I can move the Automation Accounts as their devs update the app to support this)
 The above has no impact on the 3rd party apps, correct?
 But what about if/when i change my domain in AzureAD away from Federated to Managed? Does that impact?
 Ive been doing a lot of reading, and seen plenty of people say that they read too much into this, it ended up not being as complicated as expected. My issue is the client has a large regulated workforce that cannot accept significant downtime!

                              <span>Does anybody have experience with restoring a XCP server backup? I made a backup with Paragon Hard Disk Manage. After the backup I deleted the virtual disk, created a new one and installed Windows Server 2019 on my server. Then I deleted the virtual disk again, created a new one and tried to restore it with the Paragon Software but then an error occures: Attributes of the target hard disk do not correspond to that of the selected archive! I guess due to the different representation of the hard disk. Now for Disk 0 two partitions, one with 2 TB and one with 1.49 TB are displayed I‘m wondering why the virtual disk is now displayed as two partitions with unallocated space and not as one partition with the complete storage of 3.49 TB

                              <span>We have a hybrid environment with on-prem print server. New computers are in Azure AD. When trying to add a printer to one of the new Azure AD computers, the UAC prompt appears, I enter my Azure AD local admin credentials to allow driver install, and then after a bit, I get an &quot;access denied&quot; message.
 The event log shows: &quot;The print spooler failed to import the driver that was downloaded from \\prt01\print$\x64\PCC\oemsetup.inf_amd64_a3d32de99448d391.cab into the driver store for driver 2507ci KX. Error code&#x3D;800702e4. This can occur if there is a problem with the driver or the digital signature of the driver.&quot;
 This problem does not occur on the older on-prem AD connected computers. On them drivers are automatically downloaded from the print server and installed without issue.
 Why is the Azure AD joined computer unable to download print drivers from the print server? What do you guys think the problem could be? Any solutions?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I am considering methods to connect remotely to my iMac across the internet from an iPad Pro. Ideally I will avoid services that enable the connection via an unrestricted server (udp holepunch) even when the service is advertised as encrypted (so teamviewer, jump and even vpns are excluded).
 I prefer direct connections (ssh for terminal access and rdp for the windows but don&#x27;t like the risk associated with port forwarding. My solution is to implement tcp wrapper on the server and either restrict the client access to the smallest range of IP addresses from whichever location I am at or each time I connect, restrict the IP address to my actual IP address at the time. To configure the tcp wrapper I would connect to the server using jump and then once I have configured it take down that connection and then come in directly using rdp and ssh (with access restricted to my remote IP address only). The jump “daemon” will run for 5 minutes periodically (say, once or twice an hour) so the jump connection will only be available within that window.
 In summary use the udp holepunch style services (jump, Team viewer, vpn) as a way of initialising the direct connection and as a backdoor route if I manage to lock myself out but do 99% of my connectivity directly. If I am able to restrict access to just the range of IP addresses used by whatever ISP I am coming in from, I might only have to configure tcp_wrapper once for each ISP from which I am connecting. If that isn&#x27;t viable, I am cool with re-initialising each time my remote IP changes.
 I should add that all my important passwords are 16 chars in length and all have lower case, upper case, numbers and special chars so I feel fairly protected against brute force attacks.
 what do you think of this plan?
 thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi
 I want to create a tree diagram from a actual AD Server so that I can see the groups that are created and users added to each group. To have a overview of the existence user and groups, because I have the task to do a clean up of user and groups on the AD. And with a Tree Diagram I would be more easy to reach each manager of departments and with them decide what to clean. 
 Is it possible, what kind of solution exists for it?

                              <span>Hoping someone can help me stop pulling my hair out.
 My client has a SonicWall as their router, and we use Shaw as an ISP. Shaw called me last month and said our router is pulling too many IPs (~500) when we are only assigned 5. Nothing has changed in our configuration that would have caused this - I have literally not touched this client&#x27;s network in over a year.
 So, checking their settings from the ISP, looks like:
 WAN IP: 1.2.3.200
 Subnet: 255.255.254.0
 Gateway: 1.2.3.1
 We are assigned the static IPs .200-.204
 Right off the bat, I&#x27;m thinking - there are your 500 IPs, its just getting everything on the subnet they gave me. Due to the gateway address, I can&#x27;t make it smaller than 255.255.255.0. When I make that change, guess what? Now there&#x27;s only 200-something IPs being pulled. They swear the original settings are correct.
 When I look in the SonicWall logs, I see lots of &quot;failed TCP packets&quot; from some China IP with a destination of another IP on the subnet that is not in our block of static IPs (lets say it is 1.2.3.50). Is there something configured in the SonicWall that is doing this?
 I told Shaw that their equipment should be restricting the IPs to whatever they give us, and its not my fault/problem. They came and replaced their modem today and it still has the same problem - pulling way too many IPs. Their next step is they want me to factory reset the SonicWall and set it up from scratch - no way am I doing that!
 Any thoughts?

                              <span>Hi everybody!
 It has been a while that I was asking myself how big Datacenter operators like Hetzner or OVH do that magic that forces the MAC address and IP binding so that if you, for example, change the MAC address of a VM you won&#x27;t receive any more package, although having the IP correctly configured. Is that static ARP? Or something else?
 Second part of the question: transparent PPPoE offloading. Is there any device that is capable to terminate the PPPoE session and transparently pass it as IPv4 to my client(s)?
 Bonus: is there an appliance that implements both features?
 As you might have imagined, the deployment scenario is a /27 that my provider delivers over PPPoE and I would like to offload the session on a dedicated appliance and then bind single IP addresses to different MACs in my DMZ.
 I have a 2.5G WAN so target speed is around that but could have few 2.5/10G ports since clients will mainly be 1G.
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>Hello all, As a network engineer for a large multinational, I am interested in skilling up in Cloud, but specifically Cloud networking. My problem is, to date my only involvement with cloud has been delivering the connectivity into AWS/Azure via Direct Connect or cross-connect. This is relatively straightforward and bread and butter for a network engineer. How does one actually get involved in the cloud side of networking? 
 Do your org have network engineers who specifically look after the cloud network only?

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;m in the process of evaluating some access layer switch replacements for the SMB I work at. Here is what I&#x27;m having a hard time deciding: 
 I am looking at either Cisco C1000 or Aruba CX6000 48 and 24 port PoE switches. Supply chain is like everything else right now and lackluster at best. They are also getting pretty expensive. 
 I can find &quot;previously loved&quot;/refurb Aruba 2530 or Cisco 3750X 48 and 24 port PoE switches that support our requirements for about 1/5 to 1/3 of the cost from a reputable supplier. Cisco 3750X is out of support and the 2530 will be soon, so no critical vulnerability patches when/if they happen. 
 Our perimeter will be secured with either Fortigate or Palo Alto and proper segmented network design, and these switches will sit only on the access layer. 
 What I&#x27;m struggling with is justifying the HUGE jump in price to go brand new. Yes, I realize it could prevent a potential failure, but these are also Cisco and Aruba switches that will most likely last 10-15 years without issue which has been my experience with both brands. If one fails, I can stock 3 in its place and still come out ahead. 
 Curious what the consensus is on missing out on vulnerability patches on switches that are at the access layer? Judging from other threads it&#x27;s a mixed bag, but thought I&#x27;d see what kind of discussion comes up! 
 Thank you!

 What alternatives do I have?,
 I don&#x27;t want to touch the Gateways, can i adopt directly the AP from controller 2?.
 Dynamic IP?
 VPN is an alternative, but does it worth?.
 Thank You.

 Switch 1 is a Ubiquiti EdgeSwitch 48. Switch 2 is a Ubiquiti EdgeSwitch 16 XG. Switch 3 is an Aruba 1930.
 Here are the pertinent VLAN configurations:
  
 VLAN 10 IP 10.2.10.0/23 
  
 VLAN 50 IP 10.2.250.0/24 
 
 ​
 Here are the pertinent switchport configurations and notes:
  
 Switch 1 VLAN 1 VLAN 10 VLAN 20 VLAN 30 VLAN 50 Notes 
  
 Port 14 T U T T T To DHCP Server 10.2.10.2 
  Port 36 E U E E E PC gets 10.2.10.0 IP. WORKS PROPERLY 
  Port 38 E E E E U PC gets 10.2.250.0 IP. WORKS PROPERLY 
  Port 49 T U T T T To Port 1 Switch 2 
 
 ​
 ​
  
 Switch 2 VLAN 1 VLAN 10 VLAN 20 VLAN 30 VLAN 50 Notes 
  
 Port 1 T U T T T Connected to port 49 on Switch 1 
  Port 13 E E E E U PC gets 10.2.250.0 IP. WORKS PPOPERLY 
  Port 14 T U T T T Connected to port 48 on Switch 3 
 
 ​
 ​
  
 Switch 3 VLAN 1 VLAN 10 VLAN 20 VLAN 30 VLAN 50 Notes 
  
 Port 47 E E E E U Connected to PC. No IP 
  Port 48 T U T T T To Port 14 on Switch 2 
 
 ​
 The computer connected to Switch 3 port 47 does not get an IP from the DHCP server. I put Wireshark on the computer and see the DHCP Discover go out but do not see anything hit the DHCP server. If I manually assign an IP to the computer everything works fine. 
 A DHCP server relay is configured in Switch 3. 
 What am I missing?

                              <span>Curious if you guys running Cisco wireless enable FRA. I&#x27;m in healthcare and we&#x27;ve been having discussions lately on whether to enable FRA to deal with 2.4ghz interference in our most critical areas.
 We had tried it many years ago and it was not good, but we&#x27;re now on the 9800s and are considering giving it a go again.

                              <span>Hey there! 
 I&#x27;m reaching out to you as I&#x27;m absolutely clueless on what is going on. 
 I&#x27;m renting a colocation in a datacenter and have a bunch of servers connected via 10G Mellanox Connect X3 cards to a mikrotik crs317 switch.
 My primary uplink is a 10G SFP+ fiber provided by my upstream provider.
 The switch is doing regular switching, no firewall or routing rules are configured. 
 I started seeing upload speed issues on all but one of the servers.
 All servers are using exactly the same NICs + DAC + OS combination. 
 When running an IPerf test to a target outside of my network the download speed is sitting somewhere between 2-10Gbit/s but the upload speed is only at around 20MBit/s to 300Mbit/s. 
 But on one of the servers it works just fine and even the upload is at 2+ Gbit/s.
 ​
 Running an iperf test on the second port of the card (which is an internal LAN) I can reach 10Gbit/s both directions just fine. 
 I don&#x27;t think the issue is my equipment but on the other hand I have no explanation why it works on one of the servers.
 Is there any logical explanation? 
 Thank you so much!

                              <span>I have a Cisco SG-200 50 P. Version 1.3.0.62. This is a small business switch in an office with 90ish endpoints. It is past end of software support and has a vulnerability that will not be fixed where a bad actor could get admin ownership of the device. 
 Please help me understand how serious this is? What could a bad actor do who is admin on the device? 
 The vulnerability is outlined here : https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sbswitch-session-JZAS5jnY
 TLDR, &quot;The attacker could obtain the privileges of the highjacked session account, which could include administrator privileges on the device.&quot;

 Kindly assist, I previously posted a question but got too complicated with network engineer on site. They advised we do our own netwrok. Can someone please assist with a solution in the diagram?
 We&#x27;ve basically got two networks, one device on network 1 needs to communicate with another device on network 2. Network 2 is not allowed to have internet access.

 I can&#x27;t no more use SecureCRT (too expansive..) and i&#x27;m looking for a alternative, like MobaXTerm.How could i import SecureCRT to Moba if i use a free version that permit me to import maximum 6 sessions?
 Or, better, which SSH/TELNET/RDP client you advice to me?
 Thank you

                              <span>I can’t seem to justify paying so much for Cisco Optical Transceivers over FS. There are so many other companies out there selling it for a lot less and they standby with their warranties. My understanding is Cisco optics are made the same way as these third party companies except they don’t have the name brand…. Why is it so expensive? Is it really the name brand?
 Any bad experience using FS.com optics long term?

                              <span>Four years ago I got hired off a desk side tech job to just handle random service requests and account administration. I figured out how to semi-automate them in a month, and my boss got tired of finding things for me to do, so he put me on business analysis for our service processes and a migration.
 Three years ago we migrated multiple systems, our lead admin resigned on short notice, and I basically inherited his responsibilities over brand-new software and infrastructure. 
 Two years ago I got promised the lead job due, and a month later my VP-level boss got forced out and I was told &#x27;you are a developer 100% of the time now, hand off all analyst and admin duties to....[null???]&#x27;
 A year and a half ago I got saddled with snd set up a new inventory system, migrated mobile to AAD and Intune, and refreshed 500 mobile devices mostly single-handedly, then got told to hand it off instantly to the help desk. No admin status, back to &#x27;do what you&#x27;re told&#x27; development.
 One year ago I wasted most of my time teaching other teams the basics of Agile, AD, business analysis, and got told I couldn&#x27;t speak to other admins over Windows and Websphere and Salesforce because &#x27;I caused more trouble by sharing information.&#x27; They replaced our business analysts and PMs with &#x27;product owners&#x27; they scrounged from other departments and forced into roles they don&#x27;t understand, and told us not to talk to the business or face consequences.
 Five months ago I interviewed for an asset manager position for $20k more in an entirely different department, got an instant offer, and my C-Level immediately calls to offer me the same pay scale and the long-promised lead position a day later, provided they put the job up for anyone to apply to. I explained I had an outside offer for double what I was just offered (but with way fewer benefits and leeway).
 I played hardball in 2022-2023, management got scared about losing me, and I finally got the job.

                              <span>No E5 license. Asked by HR to get all Teams messages between 2x users for the month of December. Went to content search, ran the search. Export the results. I get a pst with each message as a email basically. Ok, this works, i got the results, but is this the best/only way? A PST with an “email” for each message? Thanks.

                              <span>Hi, in our organization we have a request to let some users upload static web content (html, css, js, images) to an authenticated web server (could be using keycloak or something like that to authenticate). The content will be available through Internet but only to those authenticated users. Currently we have an apache httpd with basic auth, and a ftp for users to upload the content to that httpd server. It&#x27;s pretty archaic. Do you know any opensource tool that can deliver same thing but more friendly? I&#x27;m not looking for a cms, it&#x27;s just to upload preexisting web content from different sources to a place where it can be published.

                              <span>We have long standing issues that have been brought to her attention, but she seems more focused on mundane little things. We need new servers, we need upgrades we have a list of priority issues. Instead we are changing how we document things, where we document things, setting up mundane calendars for meetings so everyone is &quot;in the know&quot;, changing processes that don&#x27;t really need chang because they work and they work quite well. They want emails set up so they can see every ticket submitted, commented, completed, changed etc. How would you go about telling them to shift focus, or would you just wait it out and hope they see the light?

                              <span>In the end I wasn&#x27;t a priority or my boss couldn&#x27;t afford me. I start a dream job at a local MSP 3/1. 25% raise, off on 2 on Fridays, off every other Friday, and on call for 1 week every 2 months (instead of all 52 weeks like I am now). They&#x27;ll fly me to California or wherever if I need to learn something. I&#x27;m playing with the big dogs now.
 The son-in-law VP of Operations asked my new employer on getting a proposal together to see what it would take to keep them humming. Hopefully everyone wins.
 All in all I recommend just moving on, like some of you advised. The stress of the unknown was traumatizing at times. I gave up a sure thing for a shot at something better, and I got it.
 Edit: Big dogs, at least for here. Still rural Southern U.S.

 A few years ago I was walking to my office, and I passed by the door to our on premise data center. As I walked by my Spidey sense kicked off and told me that the smell wasn&#x27;t quite right. I went into the DC and started sniffing around until I came to one of the UPS&#x27;s. Then I realized what I was smelling was sulfur. Opened up the front and sure enough one of the batteries looked like it had gained about 10 pounds. Quick call to the company that maintains the batteries and we were good to go. 
 What kicks off your Spidey sense?

                              <span>Have 2 users hellbent on thinking that a non-wireless projector is somehow wireless. I told them this model is not wireless and it needs some sort of module. They said I dont think that is how it works. After disconcerting looks one of them says she will ask the others husband (who isnt an employee to take a look at it). Honestly if my wife wasnt expecting in July I may have just quit on the spot. Pisses me off they expect super duper customer service but then can get away with crap like that.

 They are requesting that users are prompted for MFA (Microsoft) BEFORE getting to the VMware Horizon splash screen (THIS).
 Users are accessing our VDI environment from personal unmanaged devices so our goal is to avoid certs or VPN. This was the only alternative solution.
 Be grateful for any ideas or resources.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m a pro-AV engineer and we&#x27;re looking to standardize on UPS units. We&#x27;ve been with TrippLite for decades, primarily using their SmartPro line of 1U units. They were inexpensive, and held up for the most part. 
 TrippLite is no longer selling to us direct as they are part of EATON now. and sales is through distribution like everyone else. This is fine, but with that costs go up. 
 But what about other brands? I see tons out there now and just don&#x27;t have experience with anything other than TrippLite and APC (now part of Schneider). 
 I&#x27;ve installed a couple CyberPower units, and the first one I got failed in the first week. They RMA&#x27;d it and covered return shipping, but it meant a 4 hour drive to swap and swap back.. The replacement just failed again after 18 months (if that). 
 Middle Atlantic units seem expensive. 
 What&#x27;s the verdict on Vertiv? I&#x27;ve seen them more than once in the wild recently. 
 Anything else I should look into?

                              <span>We were in the process of setting up an mdm for company laptops when a recently hired exec took over IT. They asked me what an MDM was and when I explained, they said they don&#x27;t want it on our computers. Am I wrong in being concerned that the head of IT doesn&#x27;t know what an MDM is? And is it really optional or is it basically necessary?

 6-8 years of on hands service and 2-3 of management? No one is going to go for that. 
 But wait, they would prefer you to have a BS and some certs? Hahahaha
 How drunk are these HR recruiters when they write this stuff?

                              <span>currently sys admin for small business 150 people making 80k. alot of freedom, great job, only downside is 40 min commute.
 got a job offer for 100k, probably around 10k &quot;extra&quot; per year in bonus and stock options. seems like a job i would enjoy at a huge company with lots of job opportunity and its work from home 2 days per week, but there are 2 big negatives...
 it would be a 1 hour commute (each way), but only 3 days per week, AND the other big negative is that its a 4 month rotating schedule of first and second shift. so 4 months first shift (7AM-4PM), then 4 months second shift (4PM-midnight).
 ​
 what would you do??? 
 ​
 EDIT: im 25 with only 2 years work experience in IT since graduation. at a small company literally impossible for IT job growth. This other company is a fortune 500 tech company
 RE-EDIT: wow, lots of differing opinions. If anyone is wondering. I&#x27;m 25 with no wife, kids, or responsibilities. I even live at home with my parents still so it would all be profit lol. Not sure if that changes anything

                              <span>Hello, so we are working on a deployment plan for Microsoft Laps across several environments and I&#x27;m looking into some of the timing questions. I&#x27;ve looked over the documentation and the overall setup/etc doesn&#x27;t look too bad and we will run this through lab/pilot groups of course. 
 My questions is, is there any downside to predeploying the laps client (prior to schema changes/etc)? Getting the client out is easy enough (deployment solution)... but like everywhere else in the last two years our workforce has scattered across the country lol. The deployment could take a week or two to complete and for some units we may want to be a bit more aggressive on the timeline to rollout.
 Also, any thoughts on this being deployed for servers? Again... this seems pretty strait forward assuming avoiding things like domain controllers/etc. Any other big gotchas we should be looking for/might see?
 Should have added...most of our environments are fairly simple domains but some are wide spread. In any case, I appreciate any thoughts or insights into this (even beyond what is mentioned). In any case thanks for your time if you got this far :)

                              <span>A few days ago the wall mounted AC unit in the server room was making a clunking sound once in a while. I checked it out and it was just the lifters on the oscillating vent, but since we don&#x27;t have a service contract on it and we&#x27;ve been in budget crunch for a few months now I just put off looking at it for another day.
 Came in this morning and the clunking sound is gone. So - as of this moment, the AC unit is both working (&quot;alive&quot;) AND not working (&quot;dead&quot;) until of course I open the door. Logically speaking I don&#x27;t need to look at it - right? LOL.
 All kidding aside, the iDRAC controllers on the Dell r730xd&#x27;s haven&#x27;t thrown a temperature error /yet/ so I know it&#x27;s still working. However, I know they&#x27;re going to ask me to McGyver the hell out of that unit.

It seems like it will be off a little no matter what. And Google, AWS and Azure seem overly complicated both in pricing and set up maybe thats by design. Anyway thats my rant.

                              <span>Hey Folks!
 I&#x27;m currently on a bit of a side quest for my IT team to explore the viability of shifting most of our org over to Google Meet to save some costs from Zoom. I can find plenty of pros and cons online about the general features and performance of each platform but I have a very specific concern about this potential switch over and that is the control and admin of the cloud recordings, let me explain.
 Zoom has a wonderful admin interface that allows us to see all cloud recordings in one place, this is used mainly in our Sales department. It is especially helpful when a user leaves the business, we are able to transfer all their Zoom cloud recordings to their line manager as we delete their Zoom account with ease.
 Google Meet seems to have a very bare bones approach to Meeting recordings. By default it will just save a recording to the meeting hosts Gdrive and that&#x27;s it, no option to transfer to another user (i.e their manager) and no centralised control over these recordings.
 ​
 Am I totally seeing this wrong or is Zoom the clear winner in recording management with the meetings and calls?

                              <span>I&#x27;m no sysadmin, so my knowledge of how all this works is limited. So bear with me &lt;3
 We have several iPads / iPads mini&#x27;s, and I have several files I want to share with these iPads. Then simply open them with an app that is deployed on the iPads.
 We&#x27;re using Lightspeed MDM. I don&#x27;t like it. But it&#x27;s what we got. I&#x27;ve looked all over the administration pages, can&#x27;t find anything. Neither in their documentation. I would have thought sharing files would have been a more needed feature? 
 Anyway. Any advice? My idea was just to sign into a icloud on every device, but icloud seems to be blocked. Tried to change some settings to see if I could unblock it, but no luck so far.

                              <span>While I know how to do it (at least I think so), I&#x27;m concerned about the security part here- ability to hop from VM to Host.
 Environment - separate networks/NIC&#x27;s, external switch not sharing management, different vlan. Hosts are on small isolated network while VM&#x27;s are for intranet.
 Any tips on making it more secure? Shielded VM&#x27;s are opposite what we are looking for as these seems to secure VM&#x27;s from rogue Admins so doesn&#x27;t look like that is an option.
 As far as I can find at the minute it looks like the only way to hop between VM and Host are Microsoft vulnerabilities, please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong.
 Else, PowerShell Direct, while I do use it I never had a concern connecting 2 different environments together, any concerns here? Or again it would come down to vulnerabilities?

                              <span>Hello
 I&#x27;m working with a client that prefers to create independent shared mailboxes for every shared CALENDAR they would like added. Sometimes these calendars are created in the user&#x27;s account and shared out. 
 I&#x27;d rather create them under one shared mailbox like &quot;Finance&quot; and have multiple calendars underneath and shared out so they can be centrally managed. Creating multiple shared calendars under a shared mailbox can be done in OWA. I&#x27;m finding this is difficult to manage, however, and these calendars cannot then be located in the GAL so I suppose an invite is required. This is AFTER granting the user full delegation to the shared mailbox and still finding the calendar is not visible in outlook 365 client... But it exists in OWA. 
 How does everyone manage shared calendars without creating a ton of shared mailboxes?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;ve made a DevOps course covering a lot of different technologies and applications, aimed at startups, small companies and individuals who want to self-host their infrastructure. Because today lines are kinda blurred between sysadmin and DevOps I&#x27;m posting this here too hoping someone might find it useful.
 To get this out of the way - this course doesn&#x27;t cover Kubernetes or similar - I&#x27;m of the opinion that for startups, small companies, and especially individuals, you probably don&#x27;t need Kubernetes. Unless you have a whole DevOps team, it usually brings more problems than benefits, and unnecessary infrastructure bills buried a lot of startups before they got anywhere.
 As for prerequisites, you can&#x27;t be a complete beginner in the world of computers. If you&#x27;ve never even…</span>

                              <span>One of the users i support have this really strange intermittent problem with his 2022 M1 Mac running Monterey v.12.6 and the mac Outlook client. Sometimes Outlook will spontaneously complain that his 500gb disk is full and refuse to work, only to be all fine and dandy after a restart. When i inspect his mac he usually has ~300gb of free space left.
 Uptime is usually ~8 hours (one working day). I have observed him shut down his mac correctly when he leaves work and experience the error the next day. Sometimes it takes weeks before it comes back and sometimes it comes back the next day.
 My google-fu has failed me and I&#x27;m at my wits end, thus i turn to all of you for ideas.

 I believe there is lot I don&#x27;t know, so please help me out with any resources that will help me level up or transition to become a Sys Admin. Before I look like a fraud before the HR, that&#x27;s where I win or lose.

                              <span>Hi, this is located in my office under my desk. It’s a bit of a mess, I’m about to put a bit of cable management in to tidy it up, but see the server is inside the cabinet sideways with quite limited air flow. I’m looking to see how I can improve things a little. 
 I have a fan blowing air out of there which definitely helps cool the area. Generally if it’s a warm day I’ll have the air con on as well, the server fans will kick in if it gets too warm. Sounds like a jet taking off, lol. 
 It’s a HP DL380 if that makes any difference. 
 Would I be best to lift it slightly off the shelf to allow air flow underneath?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m in the planning phase of rolling out an OS upgrade (from Windows 7, sigh) for a small business.
 I&#x27;ve been talking to the software manifacturer company about the latest suggested requisites and they told me to go with either Windows 10 Pro or Enterprise or Windows Server 2019 (not sure if 2022 would work as well).
 The thing is that the software is multi-user using RDP. They suggested, instead of acquiring CAL licenses, to buy an RDP server implementation from another vendor (TSplus, never heard of that before) which is supposedly cheaper.
 That made me wonder if there are other alternatives (possibly an open source implementation of the RDP protocol). Windows Server is not really my thing (and it would run inside an hypervisor) and that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m asking here.
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Hi
 OneLogin customer here....
 I was wondering if you can still setup Conditional Access with OneLogin and Microsoft, if OneLogin handles all of the authentication requests.
 Currently when a login is entered at 365, it redirects back to OneLogin.
 If Conditional Access is configured (e.g. for outside the country) - would it still kick in regardless of the redirect?
 I don&#x27;t believe OneLogin has this feature, so curious to know if anybody has set this up, and is it still possible?

It also opens 6 of each, not one - Edge id expect this from but not Teams. Dell 5820 - Clean install no Dell bloatware.
 Ideas? Tried a lot of things, thinking about upgrading to Windows 11 (currectly Win 10 Pro)
 I can&#x27;t be the only one... right?

 A lot of our staff are pushing retirement age (and we keep hiring them - maybe the company offers low wages or something, I don&#x27;t know?), but anyway - should we just ship the gear out to site and let the staff unpack and set it up themselves, or get a tech to do this?
 The Boss seems in favour of letting them do it themselves.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to do an automated install of a product which has an InstallSheild installer. This will be used to automate rebuilds of our test environment.
 I&#x27;ve used the InstallSheild response recording function and that does work to create a replayable install. However...
 As part of the install it takes credentials (passwords) for some initial user accounts that it will create. I&#x27;d like to template the response file automation so that I can supply different credentials for these accounts during the build.
 The response file records these passwords as strings of the form !CRYPT!XXXXXXX... or !CRYPTEX!XXXXXXX... (where XXXXXXX is a long sequence of numbers).
 These data items could either be recording a hash of the password data, or could be reversible encryption of the actual password itself.
 I&#x27;m assuming these items are using a standard InstallSheild function to generate the values and handle the encryption/decryption required.
 Does anyone have any information on what this encryption implementation is?

                              <span>So for the past couple of weeks, we&#x27;ve been having random power cuts, after the first one, we noticed that the majority of our machines would stop loading any web pages for up to 30 seconds or so and then work again, but completely randomly, never all at the same time.
 ​
 consistent ping/tracert would run but pages would still not load. so clearly a DNS issue.
 ​
 Check the DNS logs and find that we would get SERVFAIL (2) errors, doing a packet capture would also show the same thing.
 ​
 We have DNS on a DC and all our machines point to that server for DNS, we also have another site with a second DC and almost identical site setup and they doesn&#x27;t have this issue.
 ​
 We changed the forwarders to use our ISP&#x27;s DNS servers instead of 8.8.8.8/4.4 , 1.1.1.1 etc in case we were swamping them with DNS requests, we have a lot of devices on our network so thought it could be a problem. Alas, still have the issue.
 ​
 We originally thought it was a Meraki switch that was causing routing issues, but it has been disconnected and the problem still remains.
 ​
 the DC with the issue seems to behave differently to the other DC as well, If I ping the DC hostname from the DC it will return ::1 where as the second DC responds with the correct v4 address. A bit of a google has suggested changing ipv4 preference over IPv6, but not sure if this is going to make much of a difference. waiting on a good time to reboot the server for the regkey to take effect.
 ​
 It could be the firewall, though I cant see anything in the logs for any DNS requests that are being denied.
 ​
 any suggestions on what the issue might be or where you might look next?

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 As you know AS2 uses PKI to send/receive files securely.
 When it&#x27;s time to renew the private key, you send your public key to your partners. That part is clear. 
 But who decides the actual point in time when the switchover from old to new occurs ? AS2 uses a 1:N relation, you have 1 private key for n partner relations, so switchover should be done in concert.
 But looking at my AS2 server (mendelson) it appears not to &quot;try&quot; to use its new key when a partner sends a file using our new public key. It knows both its old and new keys.
 Is this some RFC all AS2 implementation suffer from or just un-user-friendly implementation ?
 I have a hard time believing I have to send a precise date/time to all my AS2 partners to make switchover successfull ?
 ​
 thanks

I have no idea what happened, but if you ask me, every and any lucky event or windfall is random and every person is to a very large extent a victim of circumstance. There is room for movement that accounts for drive, effort, ability or capabilitiy but it is insubstantial enough to not matter in comparison to the random events.

                              <span>I had to replace a label printer (zebra gx420d -&gt; zebra zd620). Just called our printer vendor, asked for direct replacement as I don&#x27;t know too much about this I relied on their knowledge but I am starting to think it was a mistake, not sure still, maybe you guys can help.
 So issue is the printouts are smaller. They are good quality, not cropped, just downsized ~30% centered in the middle. This is a packing station, we print over network directly from SAP spooler, labels are .pdf.
 I tried everything humanly possible from direct import of the config file from other zebras to side by side going through both internal config utility and ZSU, gave it an hour or two of tinkering and then gave up (ultimately, barcode so it&#x27;s usable it just looks funny and bit hard to read).
 So the main difference what I found was printer resolution. Old was 203dpi, new is 300dpi. I couldnt find any up/downscaling settings in neither of setup utilities.
 Is dpi the problem here and if so, is there any trick to upscale printouts with zebra label printers?

We have a user who we add then the next day his account is not there and we have to add them again. We want to try to determine why his account is being removed. 
 Thanks in advance... JimboJones

                              <span>Hi Reddit! This is a question for all you experienced sysAdmins.
 I am planning a on-premise server setup and have a question mainly about user management. This is for a future production environment. I am taking the sysadmin role in a small company and I originally learned computer sciences with a focus on application development, so while I know the basics I am missing a lot of experience with implementing servers. 
 What I want to do:
 I&#x27;ll have a central Ubuntu server that runs as a NAS and possibly run VMs for workloads (simulations, renders and a database). I need to manage permissions for user groups and individual users. I also want access via VPN for homeoffice users and would like to manage a universal login for every user (would be perfect to be able to import these) and not have several logins. 
 I am aware of Windows Active Directory but since I decided not to bother with Windows as my server OS (mainly because of licensing and compatible database software) I want to do that on a Linux Server. 
 Basically I want to manage access so that only specific groups of users or specific users can access certain folders, thats the most important thing right now. There are aproximately 30 users but the number will grow in the future. Clients are all using Windows and if I could use the windows login as authentication for server access that would be perfect.
 Its my first time planning a complex server setup from scratch with user management, but I want it to be well plannned and documented, so any help and advice would be appreciated. I am open to suggestions about the general server or network architecture and the software I&#x27;ll use, but my Hardware needs to at least host a NAS, a DBMS and ideally a VM.
 Please let me know if anny more information is necessary and thank you for your help!

                              <span>After 20 years in IT, with increasing responsibility but still doing end user support, I&#x27;m not firmly in a senior sysadmin role on an infrastructure operations team. We&#x27;re moving a government org into M365 and maintaining and upgrading other server infrastructure stuff, and it is sooooo nice having two levels of IT helpdesk BEFORE tickets get to me!
 Also, there&#x27;s a bit of fear looking at new systems I am now responsible for running (Airwatch, eDiscovery and Purview, Security, etc), but then super fun getting to dive in, learn the magic isn&#x27;t inscrutable, show my ability to pick stuff up quickly and contribute, share the load with my awesome, and very-much-more-experienced-in-many-ways team, and they clearly appreciate the value I&#x27;m bringing, even as a totally new person to their org and team.
 Not knocking my prior gigs. They were good, the teams were good, we did good work together. This is not a whole &#x27;nother level from what I&#x27;ve done before, but I&#x27;m not out of my depth, it&#x27;s just a bigger challenge and I&#x27;m having loads of fun in an environment that seems to really want its members to succeed.
 Also today I helped in my first real security remediation, and using Security and Purview audit logs I was able to piece together the critical info showing how the email made it to an inbox, and confirmed what data we need to do that so much more quickly next time. So I might be riding a bit of a high.
 Anyway, if you read this far, thanks. New job good, this day good. All good.

                              <span>So Im typically a SCADA guy with some previous networking experience and I was sent out to a jobsite as a contractor to do a network assessment because we are shorthanded on infrastructure guys. I have a CCNA and some previous exp. but Im no seasoned veteran or anything. I was told to document everything for an audit. When I get there, though, all the IT guy would let me do is take pictures/notes and would only give me the password to the guest wifi. I said this isnt enough for me to do the audit and he just kind of shrugged. His boss is gonna be pissed though when all i provide them is a rack diagram and a port map. They should&#x27;ve given me access to the corporate network if they want a full audit right? Im anxious the IT guy is gonna point the finger at me and say he gave me access to the server room so that should&#x27;ve been good enough or something.

                              <span>I am trying to stage my new network while still maintaining access to my old network. Is there a way I can plug the Ubiquiti UDM SE into the old network&#x27;s switch without causing problems. I tried this and the UDM tried taking over our DHCP and broke all of our wireless stuff like printers laptops etc. and a few other odd happenings, and I am unsure of the best route to take?
 I will try to describe the terrible old network I inherited below:
 We have a total of 2 Watchguard Firewalls, one at each of our two locations, connected via BOVPN and a Back-up T1 connection.
 (It is in Mixed routing mode, Port 0 is our WAN to our ISP modem (Configured as External), Port 1 is our 192.168.1.1/24 network (Configured as trusted), Port 2 is our 10.0.2.1/24 Wi-Fi Network (Configured as Optional) and this…</span>

                              <span>There are at least couple of people over in /r/IPv6 that regard some networking administrators as IP Luddites for refusing to accept IPv6. 
 We have all heard how passionate some are about IPv6. I would like some measure of how many are dispassionate. I&#x27;d like to get some unfiltered insight into how hard-core networking types truly feel about the technical merits of IPv6. 
 Which category are you in?
  
I see no reason to move to IPv4 for any reason whatsoever. Stop touching my cheese.
 I will move to IPv6, though I find the technical merits insufficient.
 I will move to IPv6, and I find the technical merits sufficient.
 This issue is not the idea of IPv6 (bigger addresses, security, mobility, etc.); It&#x27;s IPv6 itself. I would move, if I got something better than IPv6.
  
Please feel free to add your own category.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a switch in rommon that has a bunch of crap in the environmental variables (set) I can&#x27;t get rid of, and Google isn&#x27;t helping me find an answer.
 Delete and unset are valid commands on rommon, but both of these commands fail to remove the junk. I think the switch was saying they don&#x27;t exist or it was read only for these variables or something. 
 Example; One of the variables is &quot;BOOT-&#x3D;packages.conf&quot;. Notice the typo. There&#x27;s a bunch of stuff like this all configured.

                              <span>I want to apologize at the start if my question is overly simple. I&#x27;m self-taught in SQL and Server admin, and the guy that had previously setup the network I&#x27;m working on is out on medical leave (not expected back before go-live). 
 We&#x27;re a small company, that recently decided to open a second location several states away from our current. Our current network is a 10.10.x/23 setup, with 1-79 reserved for static devices (servers, switches, printers, network connected manufacturing devices), and the rest as DHCP for internal and guest networks. We&#x27;re very close to our 512 address limit. Our new location is expected to roughly need 20 more static addresses, and peak around 100 DHCP between internal and guest. My initial thought was to use the same DHCP host, expand the subnet to a 10.10.x/21, block of a larger range for statics, and expand DHCP range for the rest. 
 However, I get the impression that I can create the 2nd location network as it&#x27;s own 10.10.x/24 range, and use DHCP Relay to enable communication without having to rework all of the local stuff. That should just require some changes to the initial DHCP, and DNS, but otherwise will all be configurable on the Firewall at location2?
 ​
 So in things needing adjusted in Loc1 (ex. 10.10.100/23)
 -Fortigate Firewall (for SD-WAN settings)
 -DHCP Host
 -DNS Host
 -rest of the network is no-change
 Loc2 (ex 10.10.200/23)
 -Fortigate Firewall (for SD-WAN settings)
 -rest of the network is nothing extra to setup
 ​
 Is this best practice? What other things do I need to be planning for and configuring before shipping the firewall and switches across the country?

                              <span>Hello everyone. 
 I am bit baffled... I am doing some troubleshooting between my load balancer and backend server. When I perform a &#x27;curl&#x27; from the load balancer, the load balancer sees &quot;SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK&quot; and then of course starts to push data. The server sees &quot;SYN, SYN-ACK, but no ACK. It then does a retransmit of the SYN-ACK packets, and then gives up and sends a Reset. We do have a firewall in between, and although these two are in the same subnet (should just be switched) we see it hitting (the L3 gateways are configured on the firewall, so this might be expected). 
 What&#x27;s more interesting, is I would think the LB should receive the reset and stop the data. It keeps sending, for a few seconds after the server had (suppposedly) reset the connection. 
 Thoughts?

                              <span>Is there an inexpensive fiber toner tool? I inherited some infrastructure that is illogical and unlabeled and I&#x27;d like something that would aid in identifying the strands, something like the simple fox and hound you&#x27;d use for copper. Its all single mode with ST connections in a patch panel on each side, runs are between buildings with likely less than 1Km being the longest run.

                              <span>Edit: After reading some replies, I want to clarify. By &quot;support&quot; I mean exclusively networking. My first &quot;helpdesk&quot; job I was in Wireshark picking apart VoIP call flows along with troubleshooting everything under layer 7 on a service provider network.
 In interviews they always press what feels like &quot;so...what have you actually done...&quot;. I have never physically touched a piece of equipment outside of a lab, designed anything, or had any major projects.
 I feel like I need to take a step back before I can advance. I dont mind taking a pay cut. But what roles should I shoot for? Junior, Associate, Mid level? I even see senior roles that look doable.
 Note: I said in the title &quot;near CCNP level&quot;. I would not be able to pass the CCNP at this time. I am not asking about certification, though. What I mean by that is I hold and am beyond CCNA in terms of being valuable in troubleshooting.

                              <span>TLDR: What IT position routinely uses packet capture, wireshark, and other tools to solve problems?
 Here&#x27;s the scenario: the company runs a public facing website for customers to HTTP POST order data. This endpoint is restricted in the firewall to a known Allowlist of customer FQDN and IP addresses. 
 Orders from a particular customer stopped flowing this week. We reached out to the customer Tech Support for assistance, no response. After a backlog of about $200,000 worth of purchase orders had stacked up, I dug in.
 I knew that the customer&#x27;s app was trying to make a connection and assumed they were hitting us from an unknown and disallowed IP address. Using Packet Capture and wireshark, I was able to sift though all of the Scans, bots, and other nasty traffic and ended up correlating inbound dropped packets to outbound confirmation requests (from other TCP streams initiated by us). The source and destination IPs were different, but both in Google Cloud.
 I took an educated guess and whitelisted an unknown IP Address and the orders started flowing again.
 Turns out the customer had migrated their services to Google Cloud and had not informed their downstream vendors of the change. 
 I love this detective work, using wireshark to solve these kinds of mysteries and investigating what is otherwise &quot;invisible&quot;.
 I&#x27;m a generalist - a mile wide and an inch deep but have recently developed a strong desire to specialize in networking or Cyber. Based on the Task Description above, what IT Job Title does this kind of work routinely?

 A director has spent of time on Google and asking people about networking and is now convinced that this new office can easily be hooked up by simply adding a managed switch, directly connected to all desktops that will be in the office. This switch would have one wire feeding back to the main building (less than 100 metres) and feed into one port one of the current switches. 
 I have explained that this just isn&#x27;t a good idea at all and that it would offer single point of failure, it likely won&#x27;t be able to take the strain and a few other reasons.
 What reasons would you list to explain that this is a really bad idea?

 Recently got a job as a Jr. Network Admin where we own multiple locations that have several ISPs. Currently most locations have 2 routers, one for each ISP in use, both connected to a managed switch.
 I’ve been tasked with figuring out how to access the 2nd router directly through the web UI, as currently we can access router 1 over its web UI, but can only access the 2nd router through SSH after first using SSH to access the 1st router. What would be the cause for being able to access the 2nd router this way, but not directly through the web UI? Any tips on how I can make this possible or what to check on? I’ve tried finding documentation or anyone with a similar situation and haven’t found anything, and now I’m at a loss for what to do.

                              <span>Hi,
 for a project I want to fetch various information about switches using NETCONF. For this, I use ncclient (a python Library).
 From what I understood, capabilities are describing which information can be queried/configured on the device using NETCONF.
 When asking for capabilities, I get an answer which includes
  
urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-system?revision&#x3D;2014-08-06&amp;module&#x3D;ietf-system&amp;feature&#x3D;radius,authentication,ntp,ntp-udp-port
  
This looks promising, as I want to fetch the currently configured NTP Server. Checking the data model I would expect to be able to use a filter like this:
     
 I followed the YANG model for ietf-system from here.
 I was expecting that a device which claims to have such a capability would then also allow me to read it. However, the docs for the device just mention setting it via NETCONF.
 Now I wonder:
  
did the manufacturer of the device not follow the NETCONF standard?
 
does &quot;being able to configure it&quot; also mean that I should be able to read it?
 
or am I doing something completely wrong here?
 
 Getting all interfaces (from urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-interfaces) seems to work as expected, but for ietf-system I get just an empty  field back...

                              <span>As a network engineer for multiple offices around the world, I&#x27;m tasked with ensuring reliable access to SaaS applications and websites for my users. So I have redundant IPS and firewalls (Meraki) in each office and I set up the IPS in an active-passive state for failover. However, during a recent network incident where my primary circuit experienced 10% packet loss for a short time, The wan circuit did not fail over (Expected behavior for meraki FW Possible to take up to five minutes). causing some users to be unable to access certain services for three minutes. I know that i cant control the internet so once it leaves my firewall its outa my hands but Having the ability to show that it&#x27;s out on the Internet Via a dashboard is nice.
 I currently use 1000 Eyes with Enterprise agents and endpoint agents for monitoring, but these tests only run every five minutes and may not be the best solution for my organization&#x27;s needs. (I could increase the resolution of the tests, but the tests incur licensing costs) Right now, with 1000 eyes, I&#x27;m tracking the availability of Google&#x27;s DNS, then my three main SAS applications, and local network gateway. Additionally, while the Meraki dashboard provides information it is limited and only tracks The network device&#x27;s ability to communicate to meraki, and not able to track access to services.
 I am considering alternative solutions such as PingDom to track WAN availability by pinging virtual IPs and reporting on SLA. Another option is to spin up a service in Azure, where I have virtual networks with tunnels to each site. By testing communication through these tunnels, I can monitor the ability to reach the Internet and end-point devices. but not Necessarily, the network&#x27;s ability to communicate to my Saas endpoints.
 I would greatly appreciate any recommendations or ideas for the best solution to monitor my network&#x27;s ability to communicate with the outside world.

                              <span>We were staging our Fortigate HA firewalls for migration and had to perform an upgrade to the latest code 7.2.4. Before performing the upgrade we forgot to disable the NAT rules on the Fortigate which were running parallel with Palo Alto firewalls. 
 During the upgrade firewalls failed over and the ARP table on our ISP gateway got updated with new ARP entries from Fortigate (GARP sent during HA failover). And users lost access to some of the servers NAT&#x27;ed on outside. Since we don&#x27;t have access to the ISP gateway to clear ARP cache, we needed to contact the ISP support, unfortunately no one responded in a timely manner.
 So the situation is that we need to wait till the arp timer expires in the ISP gateway and we don&#x27;t know how long it takes and we cannot afford a long outage. So we had to fix this issue asap without performing a failover or any changes in Palo Alto to trigger GARP. 
 Then we found this command  test arp gratuitous ip  interface   which would manually trigger a GARP and it saved our day. It updated the upstream ISP gateway ARP tables. I know that we could do this in Cisco ASA and Firepower but wasn&#x27;t aware that this is available in Palo. I think there is no such command available in Fortigate to manually force GARP (but I think we can set a timer for GARP in the vip).
 Sharing this as it might come handy for someone who ends up in the same situation as we were.

 Basically I&#x27;ve just pulled the running config from the existing 2 Cisco routers and replace them in the new Mikrotiks. After issuing a show run and copy pasting them into Notepad I get a 400 line vomit of everything. Is this what I need or is there a simpler command to run to get the info required to put into the Mikrotiks? TIA

I noticed that for the info there are 2 GET requests when I open a HTTP website. One if get/online and the other is get/favicon.ico. What&#x27;s the difference between the two? My answer is that get/online is the one with all the info but favicon just contains literally an image of the icon? Really unsure regarding this

 I am trying to reasearch on a fiber solution that will allow me to carry 40G over 600kms.
 The solutions I have thought so far are:
  
GPON with ERDFA Amps at 100km intervals
 DWDM with Amps again
 Switch with QSFP+ and amps agan every 100kms
  
Any ideas?

                              <span>I have switches connected together via trunk link. It was working until yesterday. I console into the switch and found the trunk link to be in err-disable, so I shut and unshut the port. The state changed to connected, and still no traffic getting through.
 The trunk that was working was 10G MMF fiber. I could still see the other switch via CDP, but no traffic getting through. I changed the SFP+ on both ends, and I was able to ping the other switch, but it was really bad. When I sent 100 pings to the other switch, it would timeout at random intervals. 80/100 success rate. The trunk link is at 10G full-duplex on both ends. 
 I tried 1G SFP, and still no dice. The 1G SFP MMF states were down down. So I went back to SFP+.
 I swapped the fiber from orange to aqua, and it was worse. With aqua fiber, there is no traffic at all, but CDP is working. I changed ports and still no traffic. I swapped to copper, and the same - CDP is working, but no traffic getting through. 
 The config on each port is the same. Upstream Switch (i think it is a 3850):  switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 10-300,500-900 switchport trunk native vlan 800 nonegotiation  Downstream Switch (I think it is a 3750):  switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 10-300,500-900 switchport trunk native vlan 800 Switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q nonegotiation  This whole time the 3850 led was green, but the 3750 was amber. Again, each link shows 10Gbps at full-duplex. I have rebooted both switches and only CDP is working. I&#x27;m hitting a wall at this point. What else could I do to troubleshoot this trunk link?

                              <span>Hello all,
 I&#x27;ve been posting here before about an MLAG setup I did and I have some more questions.
 So I have an MLAG topology, see https://imgur.com/dRFkzAJ 
 The setup is:
  
Two fortigate firewalls in HA mode, A/P. I run LACP on two ports, port 1 and port 2.
 Two NK9 switches are vPC pairs.
 The switches are pure layer 2, we run only layer 2 on the switches (only L2 VLANs). All the default gateways are configured in the firewalls.
 Internet terminated in the switches. I do NOT have two ISPs, it is only one ISP that provides us two circuits or two handoffs that terminates on my both switches. They (the ISP) run VRRP on the router so my internet next-hop or default gateway is the VIP. Basically, the internet connection (setup) is a QinQ where they handoff two transport VLANs.
  
The MLAG…</span>

MOXA CN2610-8-2AC 
 
ATEN SN0108A 
 
Digi ConnectPort LTS 16 MEI 2AC
 
 I only need a device with 1 or 2 RS-232 ports but with dual ac/dual ethernet. I get that those redundancy features make it more of a premium product but here to hoping somebody offers theses well under the price of these which are in the $2000 range

                              <span>Hi there,
 Here is a drawing of the setup: https://imgur.com/6iIYJ2Y
 Can someone please advise. We&#x27;re installing a solar system at a client. Our solar network needs to communicate to 192.168.0.100 to get data from their existing electrical infrastructure. Their 192.168.0.100 is not connected to the internet due to security reasons, it&#x27;s literally got an unmnaged switch with no router even, we are allowed though to connect onto that network as long as their computer doesn&#x27;t have any internet access. Secondly, we&#x27;ve got a TV in the entrance of the building displaying data from the solar for the clients to see, it&#x27;s almost a 800m run so would rather want to utilise and try to work through their existing network, running a new cable is very hard due to access.
 I please need assistance on how to get traffic from 192.168.2.1 to 192.168.2.5 without interfering with their existing network (not sure if it&#x27;s called port forwarding?). Client has a network engineer on site but I&#x27;m getting the feeling he&#x27;s not 100% sure how as nothing has been actioned yet, I can hopefully relay info from here to him and see if he finds a way.
 Then I please need assistance on how to get traffic to and from 192.168.0.100 from 192.168.2.2 , is it perhaps port forwarding on the Teltonika and Cisco side? And then setting up a firewall rule on the cisco side to not give internet access to 192.168.2.2?
 I can, going to be hard though, run a seperate cable from the Teltonika straight to the 192.168.0.100 network and then the 192.168.0.100 network is not going to be connected to the Cisco network at all, but then I&#x27;ll need advise on how to set up on the Teltonika side to not give internet to 192.168.0.100 but still be able to access it.
 Thanks in advance for any assistance!

                              <span>Head of network refuses to set to UTC due to the fact that it would be tough to do the conversion while troubleshooting. Looking for opinions as every place I have been has made UTC mandatory for everything network or otherwise. Much appreciated!

                              <span>Currently have a cradlepoint to connect some remote equipment back to AWS cloud. It works okay but not really a fan of the UI and the subscriptions are getting expensive. I realize there is a hardware + software piece here. I&#x27;m okay with putting together my own hardware - just need a good software solution. I&#x27;ve done a bit of research - but haven&#x27;t found anything that sticks out as a clear winner.
 ​
 Key Needs:
  
Robust change management (file based so it&#x27;s git compatible)
 Tolerant of minor config errors so we can still get in to rollback changes (similar to how netcloud w/cradlepoint works as this will be at remote sites)
 Easy button to VPN connect a local network (OpenVPN, wireguard, etc)
 Management of local WiFi interfaces on the device
 Management of backhaul (4G/5G) modems on the device
 Preferably no need to ever login to it - can do everything by pushing config somehow (centrally managed).
 Prefer something that can be installed on ARM, but X86 is also fine.
 Centralized logging/reporting
  
​
 Basically I&#x27;m looking for something that is always reachable via 4G/5G modems (assuming the network is up w/valid service of course) - and allows remote configuration of WiFi APs and VPN backhaul of locally attached devices.
 ​
 Thank you.

                              <span>I get why we see a disproportionate amount of posts where people are venting about something stupid going on with their job. If things are smooth sailing, there’s nothing really to post about.
 The amount of negative posts though can likely turn off people looking change their career or enter the workforce from considering this as an enjoyable career choice. I find it to be very leisurely with rare moments of frustration or stress.
 Maybe it would be good to have flair specifically for sharing a good change or policy that has been implemented at your work, or how you were able to find that one person with vendor support who was able to solve the problem you’ve been dealing with for months.
 Alternatively there could just be a weekly recurring thread that just contains positive anecdotes.

                              <span>In 2020 I use to work for a company that focuses on children learning games, applications and animated videos. The company came up with an idea of an app that would be able to combine all the existing content that company have plus some premium features for children education especially in remote and rural areas. So we were 8 people in the team me and co worker that will work on the backend and front end, 2 backend engineers for the api and database work , 2 artists, 1 scrum master and one and only product manager.
 When we had our first team meeting it was stated that application will specifically be targeted to children and should be shown in the kids categories of the store page, we discussed some parameters of the application than we moved towards technical aspects of the game.

                              <span>TL;DR: coworker had an emergency update he needed to push that delayed mine. Showed up late. Didn&#x27;t ping me to let me know they were done.
 So, our git instances are VERY out of date. We&#x27;re playing catch up on updates right now. It happens.
 Two weeks ago I announced my upcoming maintenance. I brought it up every day at least in passing to announce it. Explained it is going to take me nearly 3-4 hours to complete. It&#x27;s just how it is. I told my teammates to let their pods know that I&#x27;m going to be doing this. I was very clear. However, an emergency happened and my coworker assured me they would have it done quickly so it didn&#x27;t hold me back....
 Maintenance was supposed to start at 8 pm. 8:30 the pm they work with contacts me asking where they are. I don&#x27;t know. I offered to do the maintenance for them so it doesn&#x27;t slow me down. They declined saying that the person will be there soon.
 8:45 they show up. I send them a message telling them to let me know once they&#x27;re done so I can get started. 9:45 rolls around and nothing. I assume it&#x27;s going bad so I offered to help. Nothing. I contact the pm. Nothing. I wait a few more minutes then get a message from the pm saying they&#x27;ve been done for a little while ago and he&#x27;s surprised no one told me.
 It&#x27;s now 10 pm. I&#x27;ve got a long maintenance to complete... And I&#x27;m the Early Morning team (I start at 7 am)
 Thanks. Really. I didn&#x27;t want to sleep anyway.

                              <span>Hey Guys,
 just wondering what you guys driving for a laptop on a daily base. I am looking for a new one so maybe I can get some inspiration.
 I am working in IT - Server management
 currently got a Lenovo t14 from work with their image so its not my personal one. looking for a windows machine with bright display and maximum 2560px resolution, bc too much is bad for battery. life. I want to be able to work a whole day. I know that&#x27;s not possible but maybe there is a laptop for 8h use with simple tasks like surfing and doin ssh. Also important for me is the performance. I want desktop class performance when I need it for adobe e. g. and want to be able to turn off the GPU and use the CPU integrated one for maximum battery life... might need to write a script for that^^ Screen size between 14 and 16 inch. 14 inch is a bit to small for me but would work.
 ​
 Looking into getting the X1 Extreme from Lenovo.
 What are you guys running and in which use case? What are you looking for when choosing a laptop? What are features you need? (RJ45, HDMI, ...)

 I decided to do myself and this sub a solid and do a legit interview with this company on my Friday afternoon.
 HR and the IT manager both had cameras off the whole time, and the IT guy proceeds to describe their environment to me. He says they have over 400 employees, but “only about half” have accounts and/or computers. Patches and backups are automated, you rarely need to be there after hours, etc. So overall, maybe it isn’t on fire?
 Either way I received notice that I was not selected, maybe since I was firm with my asking amount. All for the best, I suppose, since I found out the IT guy is related to the owner, after reading about some of their current and past lawsuits online…also, they asked several times if I was currently employed, which is obvious that I am, and that seemed like a red flag to me.
 Stay picky out there!

                              <span>A little over a year ago we got a new CIO. We have only had one CIO during the entire existence of my employer’s existence so this was all new to everyone. We hired someone from out of state who has previously worked as IT director for a company about 5x our size. We are a medium sized company with about 5,000 employees worldwide. Up until recently everything has been business as usual with no significant changes. 
 Today I heard that a company called TCS will start supplementing our work to help complete projects and handle day-to-day support. It was explained to us that this will allow us to drive more strategic concepts and leave support. 
 My boss scheduled a meeting with me for next week to go over the SOW and the SOW was attached to the meeting. I looked it over and it consists of several different areas (servers, databases, VMWare). These are my key competencies. 
 TCS is quoting a yearly cost that is half of my salary.
 I asked my boss why my areas of expertise are subject and it was simply reiterated that I should focus on strategic work and let TCS handle the daily and we will talk more in the meeting next week.
 I feel like I may be in the chopping block but maybe I’m looking into it. Does anybody have any experience with this type of situation?

 I&#x27;m back today with everyone&#x27;s favourite: self-doubt!
 ​
 So I&#x27;ve been in my position close to a year now, and while I&#x27;m constantly being told I&#x27;m doing good work by keeping an old system stood up, and bringing its security forward from 2016, the self-doubt has recently been creeping in. besides the fact that my fresh out of college skills were already lacking as a 1.5-man team I&#x27;m starting to feel like I&#x27;m stagnating right before i can call myself fully fledged. I say 1.5-man-team since while the one keeping the system standing for the last 3 years is here, his department is of course first, so we call him affectionately &quot;the production duck&quot;

 As for why I feel stagnating, I see so many people going on how scripting and automating yourself o…</span>

                              <span>Just trying to get a sense to how people are dealing with the hybrid work from home environment. Part of our insurance requirement is MFA for all our open to public applications. This has caused a bit of a problem for users that BYOD who used to access their email via outlook, and now are forced to go through MFAA and webmail.
 We are an exchange on prem shop without azure ad, or o365.
 There&#x27;s been a lot of grumbling about this, and we&#x27;re now being pushed to allow this functionality again. How have you gods of admins been securing your exchange access, while allowing users to use native email clients or outlook on devices outside the internal network?
 Any best practices or recommendations would be greatly appreciated :)
 ​
 EDIT: WOW thank you all for the super useful tips, I&#x27;m going to go through some of the options like DUO and see if they will suit, or propose Certificates again through foriauth, I really appreciate everyone&#x27;s feedback and lots of good info to dig through.

                              <span>Everybody knows entry-level IT is oversaturated. What hardly anyone tells you is how rare people with actual skills are. How many times have I sat in a DevOps interview to be told I was the only candidate with basic networking knowledge, it&#x27;s mind-boggling. Hell, a lot of people can&#x27;t even produce a CV that&#x27;s worth a dime.
 Kids can&#x27;t use computers, and it&#x27;s only getting worse, while more and more higher- and higher-level skills are required to figure out your way through all the different abstractions and counting.
 How is this ever going to work in the long-term? We need more skills to maintain the infrastructure, but we have a less and less IT-literate population, from smart people at dumb terminals to dumb people on smart terminals.
 It&#x27;s going to come crashing down, isn&#x27;t it? Either that, or AI gets smart enough to fix and maintain itself.
 Please tell me I&#x27;m not alone with these thoughts.

                              <span>Hello all,
 This may come off as a rant, and that&#x27;s because it is. I feel that I&#x27;m stuck in a loop trying to construct an effective plan to become a Sys. Admin; specifically a linux sys. admin. I have four years of helpdesk experience; I&#x27;m about to get my associates in Information Systems, then transfer to Uni for a B.S in Comp Sci. I want to get into Linux System Admin work with the eventual goal of working in DevOps. I&#x27;m studying for my RHCSA, and I have a homelab going, but I&#x27;m not sure if any of this is actually effective in getting me an actual job. Every job requires years of experience. So I got my foot in the door with the helpdesk, but I see posts saying that the helpdesk is the first step in becoming a sys. admin and equal posts are saying it&#x27;s totally irrelevant. I know internal…</span>

                              <span>I did a simple contract with a company about 6 months ago. The contract wasn&#x27;t anything big, just to make and setup a server dedicated for handling backups for the company. But I learned a lot about the company back then, lots of computer / security issues. 
 The company is a manufacturer of coils for generators, most of the staff is on floor operating complex machines and such. The few computers they do have are in the offices, this is where the owners of the company work, if they aren&#x27;t on the floor. They have about 7 computers, a small Synology NAS, and the new backup storage server. This seems pretty simple and okay until you realize that they use a standard Spectrum router, no VPN server, and have FTPS exposed to the open internet. They have the Synology NAS directly facing the world.…</span>

 My company has this one guy I can&#x27;t fucking stand. Who doesn&#x27;t understand technology isn&#x27;t perfect and sometimes shit breaks and you just gotta be a little patient. 
 Latest interaction breakdown:
 Text Message
 Dude - Sends a screenshot of the conference room PC with an Office login prompt 
 (no context)
 Me - Sometimes Microsoft wants you to re-authenticate no biggie just sign back in and you should be good.
 Dude - I’m getting really frustrated. Everything I log into this computer I have to sit and wait for something new to be done. I shouldn’t have to wait. 
 Me - (Notices the screen shot shows mouse hovering over &quot;ignore for now&quot;) Did you sign in? Or did you click &quot;ignore for now&quot;
 Dude - I’m trying to run a meeting dude Figure it out. I don’t have time for this. 
 Me - Apologies, Microsoft can be a pain sometimes
 Getting real tired of idiots not grasping the fact that sometimes updates happen, sometimes Microsoft want&#x27;s you to re-authenticate. Shit ain&#x27;t perfect.

                              <span>I am replacing a failed SAS 10k/300Gb drive with a 15k/300Gb SAS drive. 
 OpenManage identifies the new hdd, but when I go to &quot;Assign Global Hot Spare&quot; I am met with a long error:
 Physical Disk 1:0:6: This Physical disk is not suitable to protect all current or potential virtual disks on this controller. Possible reasons include: Insufficient physical disk space, unsupported mix of SAS and SATA type physical disks, unsupported mix of SSD and HDD type physical disks, unsupported mix of 512Bytes and 4KBytes sector size physical disks, unsupported mix of PI capable and incapable type disks and non-SED drive assigned as a GHS when encryption virtual disk is present. Continue with assigning as a global hot spare? 
 If I proceed to &quot;Assign Global Hot Spare&quot; for the new hdd, it fails, otherwise it currently sits as &quot;Ready&quot; but no rebuilding happens. 
 I do have a VD0 that showing as Degraded and my firmware is out of date (vast number of reasons why assuredly. My work has a lot of legacy hardware and software and things have collapsed in the past from updates) 
 Any advice is very appreciated, thank you so much!

 Was wondering if anyone has completed a one-drive migration using Migration Manager. I&#x27;ve done a test migration with one user, however it seems to have migrated all the data to the root of OneDrive and not within the folders I&#x27;d like.
 CSV file is configured as follows
 Column A has the data source Column B,C not filled in as not required for onedrive Column D has the email address for the onedrive user Column E has the folders. I&#x27;ve done this for each folder I would like to move, Pictures, Desktop, Documents so three columns for each.
 Column F I have the same as column E thinking it would put whatever was in the pitures to pictures in onedrive ect.
 ​
 Any help would be great, thanks.

                              <span>Just moved from tier II to system admin for a small company. To say I’m a little overwhelmed is an understatement but I think that’s how it goes. Anyway I have a pretty serious problem I think and would def appreciate some advice. 
 So the company I’m working for conducts certification training and has 100 or so workstations (split between 15 corporate employees and 85 student computers). Every computer has windows 10 enterprise installed but I have no clue where the licensing information is. The computers are also so old there’s no original license key burned into the motherboard. The admin who set this all up died and his replacement was clueless. When a computer needed to be reimaged he used keys from visual studio :( (all I can do is put a sad face here). 
 So here’s my question, am I right to assume that I would need to contact a license broker and purchase a windows 10 pro volume OEM license? Does anyone have any idea how much that might cost for 100 computers? 
 Also, I think enterprise would be better for the corporate employees. We already have E3 licenses and are a silver partner with Microsoft. Once there’s a legit windows installation and the machine is added in azure I think that would check that block, but would there be any reason to also upgrade student computer from pro to enterprise (I don’t think so)?

 does anyone have snmp monitoring running for Dell PowerVault Appliances? I have tried to understand the vendor MIB but can&#x27;t find anything valuable.
 I&#x27;m using PRTG.
 Grateful for any advice!

I have a lot of front/back ends but on each front end I define an ip blacklist that gets updated and I&#x27;d like HA to re-read the updated file without having to issue a full reload.
 acl white_list src -f /etc/haproxy/http-request.white
 acl abuseipdb src -f /etc/haproxy/abuseipdb-100.black
 http-request allow if white_list
 http-request deny deny_status 403 if abuseipdb
 How can I tell HA to just reload /etc/haproxy/abuseipdb-100.black
 assuming using the API in some way..

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 before I start with the actual topic I want to mention that I am in training for the job. I basically have &quot;private user experience&quot; but other than that everything is pretty basic. Also even though I would apreciate solutions to my questions I much rather prefer hints in the right direction. After all I also have to understand what I am doing and not only do stuff because it has to be done.
 With that said, I will start with the actual problem.
 I am getting trained by an university. We have 5 relevant subnets, 3 are for different student rooms with around 20-30 Clients. One subnet has the DHCP on a Linux based Server and one has a new Windows Server with the WDS and the Deployment Workbench. These infrastructure decisions can&#x27;t be changed. Reasons are preference in depart…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;ve setup Microsoft 365 Defender Outgoing Anti-spam policies per Microsoft&#x27;s recommendations.
  
&quot;Restrict sending to external recipients (per hour)&quot; is set to 500.
 
&quot;Maximum recipient limit per day&quot; is set to 1000
 
&quot;Over limit action&quot; is set to &quot;Restrict the user from sending mail&quot;
 
 Yesterday the Policy triggered, and the User got blocked.
 The &quot;High-severity alert: User restricted from sending email&quot; said
  
User name@domain.dom has sent 35 internal and 342 external recipients in the last day, exceeding their External limit&quot;
  
So why was the Policy triggered, and the User blocked?
 This is the 3rd or 4th time this has happened, on 2 different MS Tenants.
 I&#x27;ve checked that no other policies are in effect.
 The user in question made a mail with more than a hundred Recipients and that mail had an empty Subject Line (yep!)
 Theory: Microsoft has an extra set of (not visible) policies that might trigger before the limits we have defined, is reached.
 Any other ideas?

 A few days ago I found out this tool. I like the fact you can have a link to your settings, including special char combinations. For me that I have to manage many different systems with different password requirements, it&#x27;s a godsend.
 Just sharing this in case anyone finds it useful as well.

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I have a requirement to host a SQL database for a mobile app. I&#x27;ve built a SQL server in our DMZ on a workgroup, not joined to the domain. I&#x27;m therefore using SQL logins.
 The main SQL server on our LAN has a one way connection LAN&gt;DMZ to push certain tables into a new DB on the new DMZ SQL server.
 It&#x27;s all working great, but I&#x27;m not sure how best to go about granting the app access.
 I&#x27;ve created a new SQL user on the database with read only access, is that right? I&#x27;ve noticed it&#x27;s also appeared under security/users and I can use it to login with SSMS?
 Just want to ensure I&#x27;m doing the right thing here.
 Thanks!!

                              <span>We have a very small client who was looking for a very simple project manager.
 Nothing advanced, just something very simple to say Engineer A and B will be doing 1-2-3 tomorrow at 12pm.
 They already Have M365 so i was thinking just use MS Planner.
 They only have 2 office workers who will be doing the project management and both have Business Premium.
 They will be doing the project managment for about 15 engineers, although non of them actually need to access planner or get any notifications.
 So my question is, can they use unlicensed users to add them into planner (More for a visual aid than anything else) or would they need to purchase a license of some sort?
 ​
 Edit: to avoid confusion, i&#x27;m talking about Tasks by Planner&quot; integrated in Teams.

                              <span>Hi all.
 We&#x27;re using SSL certs on our (mainly microsoft) systems, currently at 400+ servers. We have a mix of internet registered wildcard, and local generated. The certs are for use with either web based systems, or some custom applications and RDP.
 At the moment this is a manual process and we really need some monitoring to email alert us in advance of expiry. An additional preference if possible is the tool to also allow us to renew the cert.
 Does anyone have any suggestions? 
 One requirement is we need to download and host the application internally. We don&#x27;t host systems for external use so will not permit a web based SSL monitor (such as Dotcom-monitor) inbound access.
 Preferably a windows based app, but if it needs to run on Linux, I&#x27;m sure I can convice our manager that needs to happen. I&#x27;ve found one script on an MS site, but this requires plugins and scripitng knowledge, which I&#x27;m not familiar with, but could follow instructions.

 In the organisation I am working in right now, the comment has been made, why do we use Windows Server as a Fileserver, and not Linux. Linux is safer, it&#x27;s free and better to manage. Whilst with the last argument I don&#x27;t agree, the first two I do agree only if you actually update it continously to stay up-to-date.
 Situation only is, everything in the organisation is Windows. The workstations are Windows, AD is Windows, Domaincontroller ofcourse is Windows, GPO&#x27;s are also applied in the organisation. What I can find on the internet is:

                              <span>I’m the only sys-admin of a small but growing 25 person engineering company and I’m thinking about implementing a ticket system but I’m not sure if it’s beneficial.
 I only get two or three user problems per day but I don’t like how the users throw me out of my focus by chatting me up in Teams or calling me and expecting me to answer immediately just to fix the smallest of problems. The company is also trying to hire additional employees and I think it may be important to get another IT person soon. So all in all I do see a ticket system as an improvement.
 The problem is that my boss or anyone else in this company doesn’t know anything about IT and he doesn’t understand that I’m doing more than just fixing the users outlook problems because he just sees everything running fine and doesn’t know what goes into that. Because of that I fear that him seeing only a few support tickets coming in per day will lead him to believe that I don’t work enough. In reality I’m both trying to fix everything my predecessor implemented badly and without any documentation while keeping everything running and researching into improvements. But that can’t be put into tickets he can track.
 Would you recommend a full ticket system like Freshdesk in this situation? I thought about just creating a shared support mailbox instead so he at least doesn’t get statistics and I still get less distractions but maybe I’m better off with the status quo?

                              <span>Hello everyone, 
 I&#x27;m currently starting to plan migrating around 60 CentOS 8 Stream servers as they&#x27;ll reach EOL next year. 
 I&#x27;ve done a test run with CentOS 9 Stream, but I&#x27;ve ran into quite a bit of problems that would require rather large changes to our &quot;way of doing things&quot;. 
 I&#x27;ve looked into alternatives for CentOS Stream 8, and what first came to mind was Rocky Linux 8 and so far it looks promising - especially the EOL in 2029 - but I&#x27;m not sure if I want to commit to it. 
 Has anyone of you switched away from CentOS 8 Stream to Rocky Linux? If so, did you stumble upon something unexpected? Any other Distros you would recommend checking out? 
 Thanks for your time!

                              <span>One of our users in our Windows 11 test group has reported that his file explorer is stealing focus randomly.
 I seem to recall at some point someone on this sub finding the culprit but my search here is failing me. So I was wondering if someone here either went through this before and found the answer, or can help direct me how to troubleshoot something like this.
 So far all I&#x27;ve been doing is disabling background services like Google Drive one by one until it eventually stops, but there&#x27;s a theory that it&#x27;s our network shares or VPN causing it.
 It&#x27;s only happening to one of the five computers we&#x27;re currently testing on Win 11, so I&#x27;m half tempted to just format as well. But I&#x27;d rather figure out the real cause...

                              <span>I have to replace a virtual fileserver that’s has an OS thats EOL with a huge amount of data on data drives.
 Will the following plan work so end users don’t have to remap drive shares on their PCs?
 Plan
 Old server with 2 data drives with shared folders
 Export registry key with shares permissions from OS
 Shutdown server and detach drives
 Newly server built and renamed as old server with same ip
 Attach drives with same drive letters
 Import reg key with drive share data.
 ​
 Any pitfalls or issues I am missing?

 I created a self-signed certificate for domain xyz.interal.org using openssl on my ubuntu server.
 The certificate is setup on my apache server an works fine.
 I trusted the certificate on my mac using &quot;Keychain Access&quot;
 When creating the certificate, I put xyz.internal.org as common name.
 When I try to access https://xyz.internal.org i get &quot;NET::ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID&quot;
 How can I solve this and get Chrome (mac) to trust the self-signed certificate?

                              <span>Hi all !
 We just recently updated our IT charter and wanted to know how other companys deal with users signing them.
 HR doesn&#x27;t want to get involved in the process, not even during the hiring workflow. So obviously IT has to find a way.
 I thought about simply sending an email to all our users with the pdf attached accompanied with a &quot;how to insert esignature on a document&quot;, but i feel the process will be too tedious for the users and obviously for the IT team especially on the storage of these documents.
 Do any of you guys use an electronic document management system, to store and provide pdf files so that authenticated users (through LDAP or AD) can digitally sign documents ?
 ​
 Thanks for any help/advice provided

                              <span>Following scenario: 6 subsidiaries, 3 exchange servers (different sites) in DAG (1 witness), 250 users and on-prem AD.
 The plan is to migrate on-prem exchange to exchange online and decommission on-prem exchange after migration if possible. We also want to sync the user password hashes to MS365 and use our on-prem AD.
 Cutover migration is not an option for me cause of the 6 subsidiaries, so I think exchange hybrid is the way to go. I read many articles and MS pages but still having questions regarding minimal vs full hybrid: 
 - Why arent users manageable via on-prem ad using minimal hybrid? Is there a way to accomplish using minimal hybrid and on-prem ad and password sync? 
 - Why minimal hybrid should be used for a couple of weeks and not in long term? If all users are migrated, I dont have the problems with free/busy sharing and so on.
 - Modern vs classic auth, what to use?
 According to my current state of knowledge I would do the following.
 1: Change UPNs (.local domain)
 2: IDfix
 3: AAD connect
 4: Full hybrid
 5: Move mailboxes to MS365
 6: Install management exchange 2019
 7: Decommission exchange 2013 dag

 I am a fresh produce supplier and I am looking to make a website similar to forms.app or google forms that would ease the process of ordering for my customers. I would like the website to have auto calculation and send Purchase Order automatically to my team and my customers.
 My question would be how complex such website would be to built as I want to gauge whether it would be feasible for me to actually develop such website.

 Let&#x27;s start here: AV and EDR are not the same. Huntress is technically neither with their base product, their &quot;Process Insights&quot; product is an EDR, though. All these are the same class of thing (Endpoint Protection), but they all have very different design, and there&#x27;s a fourth item - MDR/MTR. We&#x27;ll go through these together.
 Antivirus (say, Webroot, Norton, Intercept X, AVG, Microsoft Defender Antivirus, etc) is a no fly list. Effectively, imagine a piece of software has &#x27;done something bad&#x27;, so we don&#x27;t let it run anymore. This is a list we call &#x27;virus definitions&#x27;. For …</span>

                              <span>Looking to build a portable WiFi AP kit in a pelican case. The goal is to bring this case to an event that is small to offer up internet service for our staff. The small mobile hotspot is just not working great and the area of coverage is too small.
 Any advice or equipment do you recommend
 Case- Will be a Pelican Case maybe the 1525 or 1535. 
 Router/Switch Need help with this the most. I&#x27;m looking for the following specs if possible. Most important on top.
 - Compact 4/8port that fits in a case that wont generate too much heat
 - Fast start up
 - ipsec/vpn back to edge server
 - PoE+ for the AP but maybe i will just use a POE injector in the case
 Power- PDU with 4 outlets or 3?
 WiFi AP&#x27;s- I have these already
 Connectivity will be from the portable hotspot on a Carrier SIM with an ethernet connection to the router/switch. I was thinking of getting a router/switch with built in support for carrier sim&#x27;s but the cost is just crazy
 There&#x27;s two ways the first one is the easiest but the least secure. But i&#x27;m looking to build both solutions 
 1) ATT Mobile portable hotspot as wan to a router/switch and the WiFI ap will connect to that. All management is done via the cloud. Easiest to setup but all traffic will be on ATT network
 2) Att mobile portable hotspot as wan to a router/switch that has ipsec back to our network so the WiFi ap will be on our network and we have internal monitoring tools and all traffic will be going through our firewall and filter.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m curious to see where the rest of you sit on this.
 I firmly believe that if you don&#x27;t participate in these things and push vendors to be better then they never will be.
 But I&#x27;ve also got enough shit on my plate that I can&#x27;t afford to waste my time answering nonsense questions with TAC or whatever, and I don&#x27;t owe the vendors one half of one fuck.
 How about y&#x27;all? For example: I&#x27;ve got a batch of PA Firewalls that insist on doing panorama connectivity checks after I change the management IP (a fine idea)... but they start doing these checks before the new IP has actually been applied (a deeply stupid idea) resulting in those checks of course failing and config reverting, even with several retries configured. This is confirmed with ping and ARP.
 So obviously a bug, but also there&#x27;s a dumb but effective workaround of &quot;just tell the firewalls to retry EVEN MORE times, hur hur&quot;. Would you invest your time in reporting it to the vendor?

                              <span>My boss was asking me for budget requests and I pitched getting an LTE to serial and/or ethernet OOBM solution for some of our more critical sites to reduce the chance of a drive-of-shame misconfiguration scenario as the sprawl of our critical locations has slowly grown from a 10 minute drive to a 30 minute drive. 
 Neither of us has much experience with these above the small business level, what solutions do you all use? What features should I be looking for? We&#x27;re probably looking at 4-6 sites, with 2-8 devices at each site that we&#x27;d want to access.

                              <span>Hi everyone. Old skool lurker here. So as the title states. I have inherited a mess for lack of better terms. I have been tasked with upgrading the dated FI 6248’s on this network I am on. What I am looking for, is some type of upgrade guide on which parts should be upgraded first. Like, chassis &#x3D;&gt; iom &#x3D;&gt; blade? Or opposite? Mix? Or it doesn’t matter?
 I have looked online and I have been unable to find anything. Is this one of those “ancient networking secrets”? Or is that I am just a terrible googler(is that even a term??) 
 This is my first time having to perform an upgrade on the FIs, as the VM guys usually handles that. But, since there are no VM guys, well, you get the idea. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.

                              <span>We&#x27;re attempting to automate some common TOR switch configurations to save time. We decided to roll with the native Arista API, which is enabled as follows: 
 management api http-commands no shutdown 
 This automatically enables the API to listen on every layer 3 interface on the switch... EXCEPT Management1. This is problematic, because we use the IPs of the Management1 interfaces for DNS across all of our TOR switches, and using a spreadsheet just isn&#x27;t acceptable in my environment. 
 Does anyone know a way to enable the API on a management interface? Is it even possible? I&#x27;m going open a case with Arista to ask about it, but figured I would also try you fine folks too.

 ISP fiber comes in to their switch, and then runs 1G CAT6 to my firewall. My firewall has a 10G fiber connection to a Cisco switch, and this switch goes out via 1G Ethernet to my network. Nothing else is connected to this switch at this time.
 My ISP has suggested that I enable flow control on my switch, but my 10G link shouldn&#x27;t be getting anything over 1G since that&#x27;s what it has further upstream and downstream, right? Would flow control really do anything in this setup?

                              <span>We have a facility (in Mexico if that matters) that is looking to do a substantial upgrade to their main wiring room and to replace all of the cat5 drops emanating from there. Their cabling vendor is suggesting cat6a shielded (unknown which type of shield).
 The vendor is giving them a choice on how to earth the keystone panels. Their recommended option is to drill a hole on the floor and drive a rod into the earth in the computer room and bond all of the keystones to that. This coincidently is the most expensive solution.
 Their next best option is to simply run a heavy copper ground wire from the electrical system ground to each rack and bond the keystones to that. They say this will work, but is still vulnerable to problems.
 Option #1 seems like way overkill to me. 
 I&#x27;m suggesting that they not go with shielded cable, but in case they decide shielded, what recommendation do I give them about grounding options?

                              <span>Was hoping to get a bit of input on this one. My company provides a private cloud environment (VCF/vCloud Director) to SME customers. We generally host either all their VMs or a subset of ERP/MRP etc. They all connect in to their vCloud tenants via site to site IPSEC VPNs and the networks are fully routed from on-prem so they essentially see the private cloud VMs as a seamless extension of their on-prem environment.
 We peer with a global ISP from our environment and have 10gbe burstable so a fairly decent internet connection. Our customers generally have about 100mb to 1gb DIA circuits, so again fairly decent for SME. The VPNs are run from mostly fortigate devices, all well specced and current models.
 When we test their VPN to their tenant with iperf, we see good figures in the range of …</span>

                              <span>Edit - This is using a Cisco ASA 5525.
 Hey all I’m just looking for some clarification on something.
 Yesterday I configured my first production IPSec VPN tunnel using ikev2. I really was winging it and I was able to get it up and running rather fast (thank you INE webinar). I have a pretty good understanding of the process but the one portion I’m fuzzy on is where exactly does the policy map come into play? Everything seems to make sense logically except for the policy map… I noticed this ASA had multiple policy maps but nothing in this vpn config refers back to that map… Any guidance is appreciated.

                              <span>I received an email from my FS account manager this morning indicating that in the past year Microsoft has been purchasing FS equipment because Dell has failed to meet delivery commitments. 
 I know a lot of the users I&#x27;ve talked to on this subreddit have been weary of utilizing FS equipment. (Some due to TAA concerns, some due to OS concerns. (FSOS / ONIE), etc)
 But this is a pretty big move that will legitimize FS beyond just optics. I personally swapped my production stack from Cisco to FS around 2 years ago, it was an easy transition and has been rock solid ever since. They never have issues with inventory, I&#x27;ve received my orders within days, and support while a little lackluster due to some obvious language barriers is pretty responsive.
 I&#x27;m curious if this triggers any others to take the plunge on FS now. I&#x27;m also curious to see how FS handles the demand, if their supply is able to stay consistent, it could be a real game changer since Dell/HP/Cisco/Juniper lead times have been abysmal.

                              <span>Hey guys.
 we are installing a dHCI system from a client, and I&#x27;m trying to figure out what transceivers I need to order in order to provide uplink from the dHCI switches (HPE SN2010M - Basically a Mellanox rebrand) to the client&#x27;s ToR switch in that cabinet which is a Juniper EX4600.
 According to HPE, the only available Xciever I have available which is 40G SR is the &quot;HPE M-series 40GbE QSFP28 SR4 100m Transceiver&quot; with SKU Q7F11A.
 The appropriate transceiver on the Juniper side is QFX-QSFP-40G-SR4.
 This is where I&#x27;m lost, the Juniper site clearly states that the transceiver lister above is MPO-12, but HPE simply says MPO - I can&#x27;t figure out if it&#x27;s MPO-12 in which case I need a simple MPO-12 cable or of the HPE Transceiver is an MPO-8 one in which case I&#x27;m not sure which cable to use because I can&#x27;t find an MPO-8 Transceiver that is compatible with the Juniper EX4600. Help me, please!

                              <span>VxLAN solution can have either Symmetric IRB (both ingress and egress VTEP) or Asymmetric IRB. From what it sounds like symmetric is better than asymmetric as the ingress VTEP doesn&#x27;t need to save all endpoints&#x27; dest MAC in its forwarding table, so what is the usecase for Asymmetric IRB ? Or was symmetric solution developed later that older solutions still use Asymmetric IRB?

                              <span>My company merged with another one and we&#x27;ve been running two separate offices connected by IPSEC VPN. Windows domains with a two-way trust. The two buildings can currently talk to each other&#x27;s devices as things stand today. Now I&#x27;ve been asked to move some (but not all) of the equipment from one office to another: VMware Host, NetApp and the ESXI switch stack. I can do basic switch configuration, trunks and vlans and whatnot but networking isn&#x27;t my strong point. I know enough to hurt myself on the sharp edges. What I&#x27;m wondering is: 
 If the Core Switch (lets say its 10.1.1.1) is at Building A, if I move the ESXI switch (10.1.1.2) to the other building, is it possible for me to keep it on the 10.1.1.0 network and pass through Building B&#x27;s core switch with vlans and static routing (Building B is on, say, 10.50.0.0 network) and across the VPN to talk to other 10.1.1.0 resources, or is it going to be easier to re-IP everything I am moving over and let the existing routing handle it? We&#x27;re trying not to do that because a lot of their network shortcuts the users have are coded to the IPs and not DNS names. Which is silly, yes, I know. 
 Looking for advice as to what the &quot;best&quot; thing to do would be. And yes, I realize that hiring a networking professional is the Best thing to do, but there is no money in the budget for that. I&#x27;m going to have to figure this one out. And of course, they want it done this weekend.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi
 I was wondering if any of you have had success measuring TX/RX in LibreNMS for an Adva FSP150 model and if so how you did it, I am running firmware 19.7.2 on the Adva and Libre is on 22.6.0 (this is likely not upto date with the latest release, I&#x27;m currently stuck due to work change control etc....)
 I have Juniper devices on librenms where under health I have dbm which shows me the readings and graphs of the individual ports for TX &amp; RX, I would like this for the Adva device. I&#x27;m assuming as LibreNMS identifies the Juniper as a Juniper but the Adva as a Generic Device this is why I see this difference.
 I have checked the definition and discovery files within Libre and Yaml files do exist for measuring the TX and RX of Adva_FSP150 ports. I took the OIDs being used in this file and set them up as custom OIDs in libre with Gauge selected and dbm as my unit, I do see graphs under customer OIDs but no data being pulled. When I created the customer OIDs I ran a test which said value returned &amp; successful.
 I think my next step will be downloading a MIB browser and checking to ensure the OIDs I have from the YAML file are correct.
 If anyone can point me in the right direction it would be most appreciated

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m having a little bit of an issue. We are getting weird network drops and packet issues and I suspect it&#x27;s coming from an MTU Change
 we recently configured all our interfaces on our Dell FTOS Devices to have MTU of 9216
 via 
 mtu 9216
 Our VLAN Interfaces and Port Channels do not have any MTU statements. Currently our ESXI Boxes are now showing less than ideal performance and acting as if there is a performance drop via network (pings randomly dropping for 10 seconds at a time under load). The ESXI Boxes have vSwitches set at 9000 which is their max.
 I noticed their may be an ip mtu config. Would this also need to be set?
 ​
 Any Advice?

                              <span>Just looking to replace some aging ASR1002 routers. We use this for eBGP and with the routing table nearing 1 million routes we need to either start filtering routes or preferably replacing them with hardware which can cope with much more routes. 
 As part of this upgrade we are also looking to increase the transit links from 10Gb links to 100Gb links as well as any uplinks to our core. 
 At the moment we have several transits coming in so we want to look at potentially having two transits per router so that&#x27;s 2 x 100Gb and then we also want dual uplinks for reslience so 4 x 100Gb in total. 
 Unfortunately this takes the C8500-12X4QX out of the picture as it won&#x27;t support 4 x 100Gb links. 2 x 100Gb + 1 40Gb would be fine but not more than 240Gb in enabled links. 
 So the next model up would be the C8500-20x6C. This has 6 x 100Gb links which can all be enabled. However the caveat is that this is coming in at £250,000 which includes a £190,000 discount. Ouch! 
 Unfortunately I do have to stick with Cisco for this. We do have other DC&#x27;s with Juniper but in this case it HAS to be Cisco. 
 I&#x27;m wondering if I should instead be looking at the ASR9000 range or if the price point of that is also going to be just as ridiculous? 
 To give an idea of what Juniper is charging for their MX204 which can handle 4 x 100Gb we were recently quoted £38,000 which includes the perpetual licensing. 
 Thanks

                              <span>We are trying to connect 2 x new HPE DL360 Gen10 Plus Servers each with 2 x Broadcom 2P 10Gb NICs to a Cisco 2960X stack via 10gb SFP+
 The Servers run Vmware 8.0 and have been firmware upgraded.
 Switches are WS-C2960X-24TD-L running IOS 15.2(7)E4
 ​
 We are not getting any link lights or connections with the DAC cables, we have tried:
  
FS.com SFP+ Cable
 Aruba genuine SFP+ cable
 3rd Party &quot;Cisco compatible&quot; SFP+ cable
  
​
 We have tried all variations of different NIC ports, different Servers and switch ports.
 ​
 The below commands have been run on the Cisco to allow 3rd party DACs:
 service unsupported-transceiver
 and
 no errdisable detect cause gbic-invalid
 ​
 I will update the post later with output from the switch CLI, but suffice to say we can&#x27;t get a link, from the Server side all we can see is a &quot;disconnected&quot; state. We can&#x27;t see any obvious licensing errors on the switches (its on &quot;Lan base&quot; from memory?)
 ​
 We also tried connecting a Windows DL380 Gen10 Server with different 10Gb NICs and this also didn&#x27;t work.
 ​
 Does anyone have any ideas?
 Probably our next idea once we re-group is to install a loaner Aruba 10Gb switch and see if we can get Server connectivity to it.
 ​

Summary
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) in response to the ongoing ransomware campaign, known as “ESXiArgs.” Malicious actors may be exploiting known vulnerabilities in VMware ESXi servers that are likely running unpatched and out-of-service or out-of-date versions of VMware ESXi software to gain access and deploy ransomware. The ESXiArgs ransomware encrypts configuration files on ESXi servers, potentially rendering virtual machines (VMs) unusable. 
CISA has released an ESXiArgs recovery script at github.com/cisagov/ESXiArgs-Recover. Organizations that have fallen victim to ESXiArgs ransomware can use this script to attempt …</span>

                              <span>I have set up where a Hub is connecting to 2 x Spokes. Two Spokes are running NAT(PAT).
 The current situation now - Hub is working with the Spokes but the Spokes to Spokes communication fails.
 From Cisco documentation:
 If one spoke is behind one NAT device and another different spoke is behind another NAT device, and Peer Address Translation (PAT) is the type of NAT used on both NAT devices, then a session initiated between the two spokes cannot be established. One example of a PAT configuration on a NAT interface is:
 ip nat inside source list nat_acl interface FastEthernet0/1 overload.
 Is there a workaround to rectify the issue and establish a session between the Spokes?

                              <span>Seems like all hell broke loose today. I have a fleet of users with ubuntu linux laptops (ranges from 18.04 - 22.04) that have been on GlobalProtect for a while now. We included 6.0.4.something in our internal repo and installing the GP_UI package is part of our standard ubuntu image. LDAP auth on the backend because Palo/OpenConnect and SAML have been a moving disaster for years...
 Today, a huge uptick in users reporting that GP client is failing a FIPS initialization. No changes to the portal or gateways, and my environment is not FIPS. Windows clients are still fine, only linux users are getting the error as of today.
 The workaround is to remove and re-install the package, and is working for these users. I was wondering if anyone else with Palo Alto GlobalProtect has seen a notable increase in users with FIPS init failure errors.
 I have opened a case with Palo as well as collected user debug logs. But, because linux has never been a priority for Palo, I&#x27;m not holding my breath. This will probably turn in to a post about how PaloAlto should drop linux all together, but for now, I&#x27;d like to find out WHY? Did Ubuntu depreciate a SSL version that PanGP uses?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m monitoring the port counters on a ProCurve 2910al and there is something I quite can&#x27;t understand. I have a port that is disconnected from anything, link status is correctly reported as Down, but after the last reset the port counters are now reporting 1.6 GB received, 3.2 transmitted, 67k dropped packets. I had a server connected to that port up to 2 weeks ago but reset the counters now 3 times and saw this happening every time. What am I missing?

                              <span>Hey Guys, I am trying to setup Radius authentication on 2 of my HP switches ( HPE 1920-48G-PoE+ ). I was successfully able to setup radius to our NPS server and am able to login using AD credentials. The issue I am having is when I login to the switch with my AD credentials I cannot see anything except for diagnostics tools. I do not see any options in the GUI or the CLI which grants Radius users full access to the switch. Any help is appreciated. I have tested multiple accounts and all are domain admins.

                              <span>So recently had OSPF go down between an edge Palo Alto and a Cisco core switch. 
 No changes were made to either device as far as I can tell. Logs show no commits on the PA and no config changes to the Cisco switch (HA Pair)
 after some investigation I get:
  
ECHANGE to DOWN, Neighbor Down : Too many retransmission
  
found a few articles on both Cisco and PA side, both pointing to either MTU issue or Packet loss
  
Packet loss is unlikely: 1000 pings from OSPF interfaces 0% loss, &lt;2ms average latency. They are directly connected
  
Some further debugging:
  
I can see the Adjacency process begin and the DBD packets transmit 
 I can see the VlXX OUT to the PA 
 I can see the VlXX IN from the PA 
 OUT packet len:1412 
 MTU on the router interface is 1500, verified by ping sweep 
 I can see the packets retransmit until they hit 25 where it is killed due to excessive retransmission 
 IN packets still come but are ignored for a timer until process repeats
  
So that size 1412 shouldn&#x27;t get fragmented correct? 
 One other thing I noticed is that on the HA Pair, all the Vlan interfaces are setup HSRP, except the one facing the PAs. For whatever reason, those vlan interfaces are setup separate i.e. VlanXX x.x.x.1 and x.x.x.2 with no standby... 
 oddly after the Neighbor exchange goes down, I see a new election between the two devices but using other HSRP Vlan interfaces, but over the OSPF VlanXX already in process. This setup seems really odd to me? Could it cause issues?
 It&#x27;s been a while since I went really deep into OSPF troubleshooting so I&#x27;m at a little bit of a loss of where to go next. I can&#x27;t find any other errors on the PA or Cisco devices other than the constant retransmission/kill loop.

                              <span>Context: two man IT team tasked with rolling out network to multiple construction sites across the county. No fiber or copper connections available so reliant on LTE until these get put in towards the end of the constructions site&#x27;s life. Hoping to achieve LTE router in a bridge/ modem mode to a UDM Pro downstream (business uses a Unifi network stack, affordable, standadized). 
 I am trying to get a Teltonika RUTXR1 to successfully bridge, or passthrough, it&#x27;s WAN IP address to a UDM Pro. The Telonika has two SIM WAN interfaces (one EE, one O2), both interfaces are set to passthrough mode and the UDM Pro is set to DHCP for on it&#x27;s WAN interface. 
 In bridge mode, the Teltonika is no longer accessible (as expected) however, the UDM Pro also does not get the WAN IP address and says that there is no internet connection.
 In passthrough mode the Teltonika is still accessible/ manageable through it&#x27;s remote management system (as expected), the UDM Pro is adoptable onto the Unifi system and can be remotely managed. However, it&#x27;s WAN IP address in the Unifi console is a private 192.168.1.x IP address and not the WAN IP the Teltonika has. Laptops connected to the UDM Pro also have no WAN connectivity even though the UDM can get firmware updates and be remotely managed.
 Where am I going wrong? Why does the UDM Pro have some connectivity in pass through mode but absolutely zero in bridge mode? 
 Is it CGNAT causing the issue? Is it a NAT or firewall issue on the Teltonika? The whitepapers state that all routing, NAT and firewall functionality are disabled in bridge mode (as expected) so, seems unlikely?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m looking into upgrading our current cisco routers.
 Environment:
 - 2x 1Gbit symmetrical bgp peers.
 - bgp routing
 - full routing table
 Now looking at the ISR 4331, the throughput is only 100Mbit? (https://community.cisco.com/t5/routing/isr-4331-max-throughput-licence/td-p/4312292)Is this correct even if we are just doing routing?

                              <span>Hi all,
 For our non-revenue-generating R&amp;D lab, we&#x27;ve been using the Cisco Small Business line of switches (SG350XG-24T, and SG550XG-24T) for 10GbT ToR switches. They have performed well for us over the years. Now I see that the Cisco Small Business (i.e., Linksys-heritage) line is now no longer being produced, and now it&#x27;s the &quot;Cisco Business&quot; line for SME networking. Looks like the &quot;Cisco Business 350-24XT Managed Switch&quot; would be the closest model as compared to what we&#x27;ve bought in the past; I have a few questions...
 1) Is the NOS closer to Cisco IOS than the CSB line was (that was &quot;IOS-like&quot; but had quite a few different commands, etc.) 2) There&#x27;s no &quot;DNA&quot; license BS with this line? 3) Are there other good choices for a 24-port 10GbT switches out there? We have been swinging our switching over to Juniper, but they don&#x27;t have a good/lower-cost 24-ports of 10GbT model out there from what I can tell... 
 (And also, I know 10GbT is kind of a legacy port type vs SFP+, but that&#x27;s what all their servers have in the location we&#x27;re buying for, and what the admin staff there knows...)
 Thanks!

                              <span>Has anyone here seen a situation where show spanning-tree vlan x displays a bridge ID for a random MAC (does not say &quot;This bridge is root&quot;) but the switch you&#x27;re running the command on is in fact the root bridge?
 I have a Nexus 9k that shows a different local bridge ID than what is the Root bridge ID. However, none of the links are in role &quot;Root&quot;, and all other switches in the network have their root port going toward this Nexus 9k. There are no VDCs running on this Nexus 9k. And when I do show spanning-tree root on the Nexus 9k, no ports are listed as the root port, and the cost to root is always 0.
 Am I missing something? Seems like a bug to me.

                              <span>Hello everyone, We have that new site to site vpn added recently between out site and our new partner site, they use the same ip addressing subnet as one of our local ones so anything routed to their subnet is locally switched (directly connected) Our teams wants to have access specifically to one server, I’m thinking of adding a /32 route but since the local vlan is directly connected, it will be preferred over the static route…so i will need to manually assign 0 as the administrative distance Am I thinking correctly or there’s a better solution?
 Thanks

                              <span>I recently started a new job as a junior tech hoping to join a more mature network and IT group. To my surprise, the network is a bit of a mess and it seems like network design best practices were not followed at all. There&#x27;s also lack of documentation.
 One thing that&#x27;s really confused me is the way Switch to Switch connections were done. The network tech created seperate VLANs for each switch to switch connection, configured the ports as access ports, and then tagged the vlan. As a result, there are 299 VLANs with most only being used for 2 ports. 
 ​
 For example -
 Switch A -
 interface TenGigabitEthernet1/3
 switchport access vlan 614
 ​
 interface Vlan614
 description NCH-3
 ip address 10.2.254.46 255.255.255.252
 ip pim sparse-dense-mode
 ​
 VLAN Name Status Ports
 ---- -------------------------------- --------- -------------------------------
 614 NCH3-NCH1 active Te1/3
 ​
 Switch B -
 interface GigabitEthernet1/1/1
 switchport access vlan 614
 ​
 interface Vlan614
 ip address 10.2.254.45 255.255.255.252
 ip pim sparse-dense-mode
 ​
 VLAN Name Status Ports
 ---- -------------------------------- --------- -------------------------------
 614 NCH3-NCH1 active Gi1/1/1, Gi1/1/3, Gi1/1/4, Te1/1/1, Te1/1/2
 ​
 I&#x27;m a junior tech so this has really confused me. I always thought that you want switch to switch connections configured as Trunk. What would be the best way to correct something like this?

                              <span>I have some confusion regarding EVPN type-2 route which I couldn&#x27;t find anywhere online or from reading the RFC. I know type-2 route is MAC or MAC+IP, my question is what does it mean if a type-2 route has MAC AND IP vs if it only has MAC? Say , a leaf got an ARP packet from an endpoint and wants to advertise over BGP EVPN session to other leafs (via spine), how does it know whether to add the IP or not in that advertisement? I know, the wireshark trace shows type-2 and label[0] and label[1] but still wasn&#x27;t clear on this. thanks

                              <span>Hopefully a pretty easy question for you guys. There are lots of usb 2.5gb adapters on the market now, lots of manufactures but I&#x27;m finding most of them use the realtek chipset ( RTL8156, RTL8153, RTL8152B etc ). I tried 2 separate brands using the realtek chipaet, not super impressed with their performance. 
 Can you guys suggest one that is reliable and maybe uses USB 3.1 or 3.2? The realtek ones seem to drop packets randomly while doing some iperf tests.

 I&#x27;ve had a look at historic reddit posts on this but everything thats returned is a few years old, so I&#x27;m wondering if there are newer technologies for this.
 I&#x27;m essentially looking to dip my toes into configuring BGP, I can see a lot of resources that&#x27;ll allow me to do this: DN42, VMs from Stubarea51(doesn&#x27;t seem to support IPv6) , GNS3 and so on..
 Is there a general consensus as to which tool is best to get myself up to speed with the BGP Protocol? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Do I need attenuators to connect 40km sfp modules on the desk with few meters of cable? And, if yes, which value? 
 I can get attenuators for 1-15dB. Some random online calculator shows that 10-12dB should be equivalent for 20+km of fiber so 10dB should be handy.

                              <span>Iam new to networking. So any one with proper knowlege pls help me.
 1.I have a dlink home router it&#x27;s ip is 192.168.0.1. its dhcp range is 192.168.0.50 to 192.168.0.100.
 i want to extend the router wifi range and ethernet ports. 
 So I have another linksys router of ip 192.168.1.1.
 I want to connect linksys router with dlink to extend wifi range and ethernet using lan cable. 
 How to do it? 
 My instructor said to connect one lan port of dlink router with the wan port on linksys router through a lan cable and turn off dhcp on linksys router. 
 So you will get internet through linksys router. Is he right? 
 Then what about the ip adress conflict between both router. One is 192.168.0.1 and other is 192.168.1.1
 Both are on Different network. Does it works? 
 As per my assumption every device connected to router through the wired or wirelessly to the router should be on same network. 
 If it works how to acess second router configaration page.? 
 Because if we connect second router to the first router,dhcp server of first router changes the second router ip. 
 Then how to know the ip of second router? 
 2.Also I have tenda router. I want to connect it to dlink router through wirelessly. 
 It has a seperate wireless repeating option on configuration page. 
 On that menu there is 3 option 1.wisp 2.universal repeater 3.ap mode. 
 Which one should I choose? 
 Also tell me the remaining changes I should do on tenda router? 
 3.does all router have wireless repeatet option? 
 If don&#x27;t then is any other way to connect second router to primary router wirelessly? 
 4.if we purchase a router for extension how to know it has all the function necessary for router extension?

                              <span>Ive seen both topologies before and I know that both designs intend to provide failover redundancy but I don’t understand the functional difference. What advantages are there for one over the other? To my understanding the difference is that dual cloud will keep the spoke tunnel up in the event of a failed hub, whereas with NHS clustering there would be a momentary lose in transport as NHRP transitions from the primary tunnel to the secondary.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a beginner and know enough about networking to get by, but nothing too crazy.
 With that said, I need to survey Wi-Fi at about 5-7 medium-sized buildings (20-55k sq. ft.) and install some access points (or in some cases potentially hire someone else to install an entire new system), then show some of the higher-ups the before and after Wi-Fi surveys of the site.
 I&#x27;ve been reading up on this, and it seems like AirMagnet and Ekahau are the popular ones, but dang are they expensive. At one building with 3 floors and 17 access points, it costed us around $2500 for parts and labor on a mesh Wi-Fi system, so we can&#x27;t really justify the same amount or more for just surveying from our perspective.
 For this type of work/scenario, would Netspot Pro be fine?
 Let me know if clarification is needed, or if I am just way off here.
 ​
 Bonus:
 I would love to learn more about setting up business/enterprise-level Wi-Fi systems, what would be a good way for me to learn more? Like I see the backside of patch panels and it looks crazy, but it makes me very interested.

                              <span>Hello,
 I recently started working for a school. All students use Windows devices. At the moment, there is no MDM or anti-virus other than Windows Defender. Due to the competitive education pricing, we are going to get EMS A3 licenses, which are equivalent to E3. This should give us the ability to manage the devices. I am wondering if we need to get an additional anti-virus or will we be able to see any vulnerabilities caught by Defender with EMS? I have little experience with this line of products so any advice would be appreciated.

                              <span>Rant time. So for those who don&#x27;t know, they decided to get on the cloud train. The server version of popular products like Confluence and Jira are no longer to be sold and everyone has to join them in the cloud. Shouldn&#x27;t be a problem, right? Both are server-driven products that are displayed in web browsers. I bet the interfaces are identical. 
 WRONG, SCRUB! They split the code bases and the products barely resemble each other. Whole layout and functionality is different. And boy do they know how to screw things up. 
 Like the multimedia macro? Tough luck. It&#x27;s been removed from cloud. So if you, say, migrate a server site with videos to the cloud all your multimedia macros are broken. Ok, so how do you link the uploaded video on the page back to the page? See, if you had the multimedia macro you&#x27;d just put the macro on the page and select the video. 
 Well, what you do is you download the videos to your hard drive and then drag and drop them back to the site and then delete the duplicate videos that are now attached.
 Seriously? Did I get this wrong or is this the official answer coming from support? 
 Official answer. There&#x27;s two feature requests related to fixing this feature gap, one is from 2018 and the other from 2019. 
 And that&#x27;s how it goes. Plenty of feature requests out there and if you think anything&#x27;s going to happen on them then I&#x27;ve got swampland in Florida to sell you. 
 This is an incredibly frustrating trend in software these days. They&#x27;ll switch to a monthly payment model and just stop working on the product, content to milk the existing user base until they leave for sheer frustration.

 After April 12, 2023, Microsoft Teams Free (classic), the legacy free Teams app for business, will no longer be available.
 Upgrading to Microsoft Teams Essentials is the easiest way to continue using Teams and maintain access to all your chats, files, teams, and meetings. Teams Essentials also provides unlimited group meetings for up to 30 hours in length with up to 300 participants per meeting, and 10 GB of cloud storage per user—all for only $4.00 per user/month.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I have published the Windows updates for business workbook 4 days ago and enabled the telemetry in GPO. 
 No data showed up yet or anything, I also noticed my GPO settings are missing some important ones like diagnostics data.
 Question is did anyone successfully deploy the workbook and using telemetry in GPO?
 What are the settings I need to enabled in order to get it to work.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hey SysAdmin brethren. I don&#x27;t know if it is because of the Pandemic and working from home, or the lifestyle, or maybe I am just a freak. I have noticed recently that I am drinking probably more than I should. It isn&#x27;t impacting my work &quot;yet (and hopefully never)&quot; but it is impacting other facets of my life. I went to my first AA meeting last Friday. It was a powerful experience. 
 I remember hearing people during the pandemic times say people are going to come out of this as a Hunk, a Chunk or a Drunk. I think I, unfortunately at in the 3rd group. 
 I am trying to work the program, but DAMN it is tough. Being someone in Technology, are there any resources that you guys/gals know about that can provide online help between those meetings?
 Are there any resources that people have used that can help people through this process
 thanks
 keep on, keeping on!!

 Nobody wants to own it, but it is such a massive part of the IT stack. There are people in App Dev roles who use it and actively add DBs, but they don&#x27;t want to own or manage SQL. There is pushback on every SQL related issue saying that this is something Infrastructure owns. Tickets that are DB / Query / SQL software related flow into our queue all the time. None of us know what to do with them.

 I got several example recipients from her and did a message trace, there are no issues on our end, the emails are showing as delivered for every single one. I explain this to her while also explaining that it&#x27;s a little difficult to pinpoint issues on a mailbox outside of our org, because we lose some of the tracking info that is available on internal mail transmissions. Anything from mailbox rules/filtering/auto delete to just old fashioned user error could result in a person thinking an email wasn&#x27;t received even though it was.

Now that a year has passed I wanted to share some lessons and hope for the next person that has to live through something similar. First lesson, from before the firing, if you hear anything rumors or mentions that the company talked to someone about replacing you…rest assured it’s happening. No matter how much management assures you it isn’t or it’s exploratory or they think you could use help. You’re gone, start making plans. Second, the firing itself. I was lucky in that I knew it was coming, their “secret” was in…</span>

 Some software vendor sent us over some documentation, and among that was a requirement for passwords to never be rotated, and for us to not use certain special characters (&#x27;@&#x27;, &#x27;!&#x27; , &#x27;^&#x27;, &#x27;(&#x27;, &#x27;)&#x27;) Two red flags. Reason for the latter is because those special characters tell the system to parse it as a command. Three red flags.
 After 2 weeks of trying to get them on a call, we chitchat and clear the air (Domain accounts can SSO and aren&#x27;t bound by those requirements, but there&#x27;s a handful of internal accounts relevant to the system that ARE bound by those requirements....I guess a bit better).

                              <span>7(?) years into my career and I&#x27;ve finally reached the point of burn out. My previous role nearly reached the same point, but I left before I got to that.
 It&#x27;s been brewing in me for some months now, managed to get a pay rise in the summer (but IT pay in the UK is dogshit anyway). The userbase we support is increasing, but we&#x27;re horrendously understaffed, no time to research new technologies, we&#x27;re locked in with garbage fucking systems because somehow it&#x27;s not our decision. Somehow spend more time doing what should be a dedicated first line support&#x27;s job, instead of doing actual system infrastructure maintenance. Sales guy is letting small clients set up BYOD systems and then trying to impose lockdowns on their personal devices, including using Intune/Endpoint Manager with a bunch of fucking Macbooks, then coming to me for help (spoiler: I can&#x27;t)
 But yesterday, I had the full blown meltdown. Simple task, user needs printer/scanner installing. It&#x27;s an older HP so probably won&#x27;t be too much of a bastard to sort. Log on, no admin access for some reason, looks like Intune hadn&#x27;t been applying the settings, and of course, Intune gives 0 useful information as to why. So it&#x27;s possible the user is still an admin. Try to get him to elevate, he&#x27;s not doing it and keeps cancelling, then he brings up HP Smart and disappears for 20 minutes and I get disconnected. Later get an email saying &quot;all working, thanks&quot;
 Just lost it. Why is such a simple task such a twat to do? Why is our IT structure so broken?
 Good people to work for, just not a good company
 Had an interview today, big pay rise, decent looking company. Stage 1 of 3 complete, finger&#x27;s crossed I make it to the end (I won&#x27;t!)
 Thanks for attending my rant, how&#x27;s your week going?

 As per title, I&#x27;m interested to hear your recommendations for Sysadmin books, what I&#x27;m interested in particular is understanding the concepts that lead to a decision when it comes to designing systems and better understand how I can streamline and improve certain organizational aspects of our company and better align IT goals with the goals of the business.
 I&#x27;m not sure if what I wrote is clear enough.
 Let me know which books you found useful
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Our 3rd Party accountant sent our in-house accountant a macro-enabled spreadsheet (.xlsm)
 Our in-house accountant emails me asking me if there&#x27;s anything I &quot;want to check on this or can change so I can use this?&quot;. I tell him to tell the 3rd party accountant to never ever send macro-enabled spreadsheets.
 My curiosity gets the best of me so I safely open the .xlsm and this is on the front sheet:
 https://imgur.com/a/54XlR85
 We try to teach people how to be safe and not click links that are suspect and to tread lightly and proceed with caution etc. Then everything is attempted to be undermined with directions like this
 One thing I did learn is that apparently I don&#x27;t have .xlsms blocked on Exchange. That&#x27;s my mistake obviously and at least something I have learned from this.

                              <span>While changing internet providers we are left with the responsibility of sorting out our own phone line. As landlines are becoming obsolete, we are looking into VoIP. We assumed it would be as cheap or cheaper than landlines since everything is online and we buy our equipment.
 We only need one number, and several headsets that work in a hierarchy where all incoming calls are going into one office with the option of directing the calls to the other headsets (if someone is trying to reach a certain room).
 All the VoIP providers are saying that we need individual users for each DECT phone, to be able to transfer between them and to be able to make phone calls. We will need 7 headsets, and what is worse, 7 users taking us to quite a monthly tariff considering that we are not using more than 200 minutes/month.
 At this point, if anyone has an idea of how to set this up without advanced setup knowledge, that would be amazing. I am also happy to jump on a quick call, for a little paid consultancy.
 I&#x27;ve made a diagram of the setup I was thinking to get for the business which can be seen here.
 Any help is much appreciated!

                              <span>Like the title explains, we just created a warning in HTML that our email appliance ads to all e-mail comming from all external domains.Which then created a shitstorm of complaints, and people calling us saying this is not a solution blablabla. And then they litterely starting to google random shit and add it to a post i did on our intranet explaining me what to do for cybersecurity. Like litterly telling me how to do my job haha.
 Context: We just did a phishing campaign run, which in our eyes was an obvious phish and 21% of the corrensponents clicked on the link of which 9% added sensitive information in a form and clicked on send. You can say that cybersecurity awareness is not a hot topic in our company which we are trying to address trough management and policy (which is going great by the way).
 Sometimes shit like this gets under your skin when people start to complain that massively shit can get to you. Which it now does.
 How do you handle these kinds of situations? What do you tell yourself, mentally?
 ​
 p.s.On friday my manager is going to share the details of the phish, and is going to say that &quot;most&quot; of the people that are now commenting on this implementation where also the persons that have clicked on the link in the e-mail. In Holland we call it &quot;met gestrekte been erin&quot; and in english that would be &quot; With straight leg in it&quot;

                              <span>Dear community,
 last time we had a case in the company that someone was sending spam from our user&#x27;s account. It was probably a trojan or someone had cracked the user&#x27;s password. We know how to protect ourself against trojans and password cracking, but sometimes these situations can happen due to user carelessness. 
 What security measures do you have in place, on the antispam firewall or perhaps on Exchange, to prevent you from sending spam from your network and being blacklisted?
 I would just like to add: Sometimes our users need to send an email to more than 1000 recipients.
 Thank you very much in advance.

                              <span>I have started this role at a SAP centered enterprise and I was tasked with building a UI that displays and aggregates daily reports of some plant. Due to security reasons, the plants terminal is not connected to the web. The terminal instead generates a .csv report which is then shared in a shared folder.
 The plants syso wasn&#x27;t much of a help in determining how everything works there. He sent me this URI that opened a shared folder in my work laptop win 11 machine
 \\hcldata1\hcs_fldr$\45-SOME-MANUFACURING-DATA 
 This opened a folder on my machine. Now, this is very confusing to me as I am a programmer and I don&#x27;t use Windows that much. Who serves this folder? Is this OneDrive (i was told no)? Azure? How did I access something not on my PC without a proper URL/URI? Sorry if those questions seem basic. I am just a Linux guy so I am unfamiliar with enterprises that run on Windows products.
 P.S: Also I need to know how I automate a process that sends reports added to that folder to a remote web server written in Node. Not a tutorial, but more of a general direction. Like, do I install WSL and write a bash script? Or do I write a powershell script? Just a direction.

                              <span>I currently head up a team of 6 x 2nd Line engineers, however we have been having severe problems with asset management. Our leaver process is broken causing a fair amount of equipment not being returned not to mention risk.
 We have 2 x junior analysts who are not being managed very well causing the issue to continue.
 I pitched a roadmap/development plan for the junior analysts which would involve them managing the IT assets and working alongside the 2nd line team.
 The response I got was ‘how much would you expect for the additional responsibility’.
 My salary currently sits at £42k ($50k) and while an increase in salary would be helpful I don’t want to shoot myself in the foot here and come across as greedy. Can anyone provide their thoughts on what they deem reasonable compensation (if any) for the extra 2 x analysts and implementation of asset control processes.
 Apologies from me if this is not the right space to raise.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve altered some information below and made it generic so as to be less recognizable.
 I was in a technology meeting where Really Bad Idea™ was proposed. At the time, I told them such and normally my opinions have weight, but this time I was outnumbered and they were locked in. Another in my cohort at this meeting, we will call him Mr. Z, is the kind of person who gleefully runs and does whatever upper management asks. He was as much for it as I was against it. So this thing got legs and ran.
 It&#x27;s my role to sell some of these upper management decisions to the group, and do what was needed to make them successful. This time that wasn&#x27;t possible. It was too draconian. It directly impacted people and their time. All I could do was offer some help. But I presented it as neutrally as possible so as not to throw anyone under the bus because it&#x27;s just never good to openly do so. As a result they thought I initiated it, which normally I live with but this time was different.
 When the complaints from the field started coming in, people didn&#x27;t want to say anything to me directly so they went to Mr. Z much to my surprise. Mr. Z then didn&#x27;t own up to the fact that he was a big part of why this idea went forward. He just quietly listened, sympathized, and then went about his day. I know this because I overheard one of these conversations.
 At that point I called a WebEx with everyone in the field, apologized for the nightmare and the impact it had, and gathered data with all of their feedback on the recent issue. Everyone was 100% against it and all of the suggestions to fix it aligned. I then presented that data to upper management and requested to make modifications to the idea so it could work. It was more work to fix it but it needed to be fixed with urgency.
 This crisis was averted, but it cost valuable time and had an impact on my street cred. It sucked.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have problem with native VPN in both Windows 10 / 11 on domain computers (with roaming profiles enabled).
 After I create (manually) new VPN connection (in new Windows 10/11 Settings panel) I cannot connect to it, because it throws The system could not find the phone book entry for this connection error everytime.
 Funny thing, when I run old rasphone client, then I can connect to it without issue.
 I&#x27;ve even tried to remove rasphone.pbk file in user roaming profile (on server), but it doesn&#x27;t help. It only works when I copy it from roaming profile into C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Network\Connections\Pbk\... but when I create another VPN profile, then I have to copy it to ProgramData too, because new connection doesn&#x27;t work...
 Is there a way to force the new Windows 10/11 VPN panel to use rasphone.pbk file from roaming profile, and not the C:\ProgramData one?

 The part I’m actually having trouble with? 
 I’ve been working on a script to re-do the user Outlook profile and completely log them out of office and teams and work/school account, saved credentials etc.
 Outlook works fine since I can pipe 2 registry keys for a new profile and then make it default on the next launch. They then get logged in with seamless sso 
 Basically a reset without nuking the actual profile.
 Normally we would use our vendor tool to help the users get logged in to the “new” accounts but of course this is a VDI environment and it doesn’t play nicely.
 I can’t get teams/OneDrive to log out seemingly No matter what I do to the registry or folders there in.
 I did see some scripts online but they don’t actually work lol.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Does anyone know the registry that I will need to change in order to change the lockscreen background on Windows 11?
 I have a group policy on my current AD setup that updates the following registries for Windows 10, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the same case for Windows 11.
 Registry 1:
 Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE Key Path: SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PersonalizationCSP Value name: LockScreenImageStatus 
 Registry 2:
 Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE Key Path: SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PersonalizationCSP Value name: LockScreenImagePath 
 Registry 3:
 Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE Key Path: SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\PersonalizationCSP Value name: LockScreenImageUrl 
 The above registries work successfully on Windows 10. But I have no idea how to accomplish the same task on Windows 11.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.
 :)

                              <span>Hello residents of /r/sysadmin!
 I&#x27;ve worked at my current place of employment for close to 7 years and it&#x27;s high time for me to move on. I&#x27;ve got a nice resume and some great experience under my belt but...
 This is my first job (like, ever)
 I&#x27;ve been told it&#x27;s an incredibly dumb decision to inform your current job that you&#x27;re planning to change companies, but I&#x27;m stuck! Who do I use for my professional references if not the people I work with?
 Apologies if this is a dumb question. This whole process is new to me so I&#x27;m a bit scared of stuffing things up.

 Has this impacted anyone’s renewal or decision to purchase Darktrace or should I start looking at other vendors?

                              <span>Alright sooo Ive searched and searched and I’m having the hardest time choosing a network monitor. My boss gave me no budget and I can just pick the one I want to work with. I need help please. I would like to be able to have beautiful graphs like Grafana can do and I want to be able to see traffic and VMs. Not so much track specific applications, but if that’s possible that could add to the benefits. 
 Currently using librenms and messing around with Zabbix also doing prtg trial. 
 Prtg is kinda mehhh for me. Librenms was here before I got here and it’s ok I guess. Just finished fixing a lot of the broken poller settings that was causing alert fatigue.
 I like Logic Monitor( no Grafana tho I don’t think)(prediction graphs amazing!)
 I like checkmk from what I’m seeing(can integrate with G…</span>

                              <span>Installed a small UniFi network for a client about 6 years ago and in mid 2022 we upgraded their USG and gen 1 Cloud Key with UDM-SE. The client prepaid for the parts but still hasn’t paid for the labor. We’ve worked with this client a handful of other times in the past without issue. But they have been intermittently responding to payment reminders with excuses about how they are about to send a check. This has been going on for 191 days now!
 What do you all think about giving them a notice about limiting their bandwidth until payment is made? ISPs and mobile carriers already do this, why not us?

                              <span>Hello Everyone,
 we are trying to isolate residential networks from enterprise networks. Unfortunately, we exit into the same landscape (enterprise and residential). The question is can we use the following subnets???? Each house will be having roughly 10-20 (max 30) hosts.
 House 1 - 10.80.10.0/24
 House 2 - 10.80.11.0/24
 House 3 - 10.80.12.0/24
 House 4 - 10.80.13.0/24
 House 5 - 10.80.14.0/24
 House 6 - 10.80.15.0/24
 House 7 - 10.80.16.0/24
 House 8 - 10.80.17.0/24
 House 9 - 10.80.19.0/24
 House 10 - 10.80.20.0/24
 House 11 - 10.80.21.0/24
 House 12 - 10.80.22.0/24
 House 13 - 10.80.23.0/24
 House 14 - 10.80.24.0/24
 The idea is to have all these houses in different vlans with the above subnets. Thank you tons guys!!!!

                              <span>Still new to the role, so I&#x27;m uncertain about the best practices for this. Apparently, this Small school has to have an internal DNS server to direct them to our website using the internal IP&#x27;s. This is for all the students and everyone in every subnet. And I asked why they just don&#x27;t use the public IP if it&#x27;s accessible. Well, the answer was simple. You cannot access any of the internal websites from the inside using the public IP address. I thought that was strange. 
 I did a basic traceroute to the website and yep, it stops on our Palo Alto firewall. It&#x27;s due to an Age out/incomplete which I&#x27;m sure is due to the Virtual router in the firewall not knowing where to send the traffic. 
 However, I&#x27;m not sure how this should be done. 
 Do I just implement a routing rule that anyone coming to the firewall internally asks for the public IP address of our website to redirect them back through the same interface? 
 Baically the Default Gateway from the Core Switch has 1 interface connected to the Palo as the next hop that connects that interface to the router, then that router has a next hop for all traffic to our actual router. 
 So 
 Core Switch 10.0.0.1 -&gt; 10.0.0.2 Palo Alto Vr Router -PublicIP interface. 1 -&gt; Public IP interface Physical Router -&gt; The internet. 
 To be clear yes the Firewall has an interface with a public IP address that we own that hops to the router with also a Public IP address that we own and then to the internet.

                              <span>Hey y’all, I’m currently taking a wireless networking class and we just wrapped up our first unit covering 802.11 Wifi, we’re supposed to write a paper discussing the differences between an 802.11s network and an ESS network but I’m having trouble finding papers or sources that detail this. From what I’m finding the 802.11s protocol is simply the protocol for an ESS mesh network so I feel like I’m going in circles trying to compare something to itself. If y’all could help me figure out what I’m missing or point me in the direction of some papers to read I’d really appreciate it!

                              <span>Short question: 
 How would hosts from Subnet A handle an ARP announcement regarding a host from Subnet B?
 Longer question: 
 We are trying to setup a VPN server on our servers subnet, 10.1.4.0. We randomly decided an IP range that the server would hand out to clients, 10.1.16.0. When a client connects to the server, the server sends out an ARP announcement saying that it&#x27;s MAC address has said client with a 10.1.16.x address. But when I look at the server&#x27;s gateway (a Firepower) and other hosts on the subnet, the ARP tables aren&#x27;t storing/saving hosts with 10.1.6.x IPs. Is that expected behavior? I know that ARP packets don&#x27;t usually cross subnet boundaries, but this seems like a unique situation so I figured I&#x27;d ask you smart folks. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I am curious to know what do you think about TLS Inspection. I have seen companies from aggressively forcing everything from every client through their firewall to &quot;The clients have endpoint protection and that is enough&quot;.
 But as I am also involved in the network design in our company I am curious to know what real world experiences look like. Googleing often gives you just a comparison table and a summary but never very specific and often just scratching the surface. So what experiences and opinions do you have about it and where do you see strengths and weaknesses in your network? Has it actively helped against malware or was it a weakness (for example due to weak root cert protection).
 Thank you for your answer in advance and have a lovely day. So let me end with the word: Fight! 😉

                              <span>Last week I posted asking about getting xconnect over MPLS running between two routers, and was shown how to do a QinQ tunnel and that was great. Now I&#x27;m trying to get VPLS to run multipoint between three routers.
 The issue I&#x27;m running into is everything I&#x27;m reading has me creating a VFI in manual configuration mode. But I don&#x27;t have that option...when I go to issue the command the only choice is point-to-point. If I try to re-issue the command the help menu will then SAY that manual is an option, but if I try it I get told the name is already in use.
 The other issue has to do with the xconnect command on the interface. The docs I&#x27;m reading have you issue the xconnect name with the VFI, and that&#x27;s also not an option: The only option is the IP of the neigbor. Maybe if I configure the VFI manually and actually get the &quot;vpn id&quot; option into the VFI it&#x27;ll allow me to attach it with xconnect? But I can&#x27;t figure out what I&#x27;m missing.
 This is on 3800 routers. I&#x27;ve tried different code and always get the same options. Am I missing something that turns these features on?

There would be an incredible cost saving potential by switching to Fortinet, but one of the security architects (who&#x27;s a PA fan and is against the change) argues that managing a large rule set on Fortinet would be highly disruptive.

How many rules do you have in your Fortigates, and how do you perceive managing those in comparison to Palo Alto?
 r/pabechan was kind enough to provide the following command with which rules can be counted: show firewall policy | grep -c &quot;edit&quot;

                              <span>Hey all,
 This question is regarding stacking/ uplinks. 
 We&#x27;re planning a new location setup. This will be my first time doing a configuration like this solo as our engineer is no longer with us, I appreciate any help/advice 
 We run a two-tier hierarchy design. We&#x27;ll have 1 Core switch along with a 5 stack for access switches. This will be for a small(ish) branch location, so not looking to go all out. 
 What would be the best way to uplink the access stack to the Core? 
 Looking though what our old engineer did, he would use the first two ports on the stack commander to use as uplinks to the Core.
 Would that be the best option, or do we have a point of failure if that stack commander goes down? 
 I&#x27;m thinking of using 1 port ( or two?) from each switch in the stack to use as an uplink to the Core. Is this silly/over kill? Planning on configuring them all into 1 LAG. ( ex. 1/1/1, 2/1/1, 3/1/1, etc. into LAG ID 1).
 Also, they&#x27;re looking at getting a 24 port core opposed to a 48. Technically, if I use 1 port on each switch for uplinks I should only need ~16 ports, ~20 if if I go with two per switch. 
 Is there something I&#x27;m not thinking of that could cause issues down the line? Our current Core&#x27;s are all 48 ports, though the old admin would use the extra ports as Access, which I do not plan on doing.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently looking into the logistics of setting up a small ISP and unsure of what the best DNS setup would be for us:
  
Would it make sense to use Cloudflare (or some provider) as an authoritative DNS and then use a self-hosted recursive DNS within our network? 
 Or should we host our own authoritative and recursive DNS servers?
 Or should we use a recursive DNS server provided by someone like Cloudflare?
  
Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thank you.

 one of the higher-ups saw an article about moving VM&#x27;s from on-prem to Azure and retaining their IP addresses and immediately asked &quot;find out how&quot; 
 I&#x27;ve found out how it&#x27;s implemented according to Microsoft so I&#x27;m good on that front, but wanted to see what others thought about it, if anyone has done it and what were your needs that sent you down that route (no pun intended).

                              <span>Hello, we&#x27;re looking into setting up a small ISP and want to have our own hardware for DNS. Currently looking at running PowerDNS with this hardware:
 ​
  
 Intel Xeon E5630 4-Core 8-Threads (2.53GHz)
  HP ProLiant DL360 G6, DL360 G7 Heatsink
  1x 8GB - DDR3 1333MHz RAM
  120GB - SATA-3 (6Gb/s) SSD
  HP Hot-Swap &#x27;Platinum Plus&#x27; PSU 460W
 
 This is pretty much the cheapest config from our local supplier. It should be more than enough, right?

                              <span>I&#x27;m UK based and a long time network engineer. I&#x27;ve met people along the way who&#x27;ve had roles where they would spend x amount of weeks based on a location internationally. I think typically it&#x27;s a month on, and then a month off. Testing my memory I think they were remote military locations, or in the Oil industry.
 I was given a couple of recruitment agency details and did inquire a few years back, but ive since long forgotten who they were and for the life of me I can&#x27;t find them on a Google search.
 Has anyone done this kind of work?

                              <span>Hello Guys,
 I need your advice. 
 I want to externalise some networking tasks to a Help Desk. I want them to perform basic troubleshooting before forwarding a network-related ticket to my support group. 
 Our network is fully cloud-based. So, there won&#x27;t be a CLI involved. I was thinking to create one generic account, linked with the Help Desk support group email, with ReadOnly rights to be used by all ~60 members of the Help Desk. 
 Some of my colleagues suggested that there is a security &amp; privacy issue with this approach and that I should create personal accounts for all Help Desk operators linked to their work emails. 
 Do you see any security issues with this or not? 
 Thank you in advance!

 We are pretty overwhelmed at the moment and I wanted to see what others though as we seem to be a bit of a different demographic composition. We do self-checkout devices. There is about 1000 locations total and the majority of these are sitting on your standard household type internet circuits. Inexpensive Fiber (FiOS, uVserve, cable internet, cellular routers, and even some DSL (Yes, DSL!). We do have maybe 300 locations that are either on business fiber, or the location we are at provide us internet.
 User base though is only about 500 and a lot of the &quot;is your cable plugged in&quot;, &quot;did you reboot your 8-port switch under your desk&quot; is handled by our &quot;Desktop Support team&quot;.
 We are also installing 3-7 new locations a week and the network team has to handle getting the internet solution in place as well.
 Our network team is a whopping 3x people. I feel like we need at least 6x. anyone in a similar setup. ?These three people are also responsible for the datacenter networking, our HQ facility, but not VoIP (other than setting up VLANs for phones)

 We are still using an old circuit switch PBX and the lines pass though the cat6 structured cabling.
 To that ned I&#x27;ve been trying to build a patch lead i can use when testing/tracing lines rather than trying to fight a patch cable into a busy panel when hunting for a line etc 
 A while back we got some new patch panels certified and the contractor had a fluke with its proprietary leads. does anyone know where I can find an rj45 jack similar to this?

                              <span>Hi, new here. Total newbie. Baby newbie. Thanks for help...
 I was wondering if the same protocols used for lower speed connections are as efficient and properly designed for use in higher speed connections. What protocols are best? 
 Also, are communication protocols embedded into the hardware architecture or can we just define our own protocols and test them out? 
 Thanks. Any help or slap towards the right directions is appreciated.

                              <span>So I tried to swap out my core switches last week and it didn&#x27;t go as expected. We are replacing our old Adtran core with 3 stacked Cisco 550xg switches.
 We have about 15 sites, and 10 of those we had already upgraded to Cisco 350x switches. The other 5 or so are still Adtran. We tested for compatibility with the old and new stuff in the lab and felt pretty good. We have a funky assortment of different SFPs but, made sure to test for each different combination. I got new FS. COM SFPs and all the switches seemed ok with them. One thing was for sure, the Cisco 550 hated BlackBox SFPs and would crash hard when we tried them. Each site was LAG&#x27;d if possible too. One thing we noticed in the lab was when just Cisco stuff was connected to the Cisco core the pings were very quick to reestablish i…</span>

                              <span>I have a collection of rack mount UPS systems after various company changes at a client. The batteries all went out of date during the pandemic and office shutdown while in conditioned storage. I&#x27;m looking to buy a pile of batteries to deal with the new office setup. I haven&#x27;t bought these in 5 or 6 years. So I&#x27;ll ask.
 The Duracell battery that I need is:
 SLA12-8F Duracell Ultra 12V 8AH AGM SLA Battery with F1 Terminals
 I bought 4 of these &quot;down the street&quot; just to test out the units. All work fine. But at $45 or so each, ouch.
 So, what brand of battery do the networking folks like to buy when they age out of the UPS systems?

 I&#x27;ve been in the MSP/helpdesk space for 3 years now as a level 2.5/3 engineer. I&#x27;m getting tired of the sweat shop that are MSPs and want to move into a sys admin role. I&#x27;ve been applying around and have not found much success in even getting into the door for interviews. 
 I&#x27;ve got:
 an associates in computer science
 5 years of total IT work experience (3 working as a higher level engineer)
 - experience with various flavors of win servers, firewalls, and more 3rd party softwares then i can count
 I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m looking in the wrong area or if I am just not qualified but I&#x27;m finding little success in my job hunt. Any advise would be appreciated!

                              <span>A bit of a rant here.
 We are testing options to have users logging with some sort of MFA into their machines. 
 Great, get Windows hello for business going, applied to some test machines : fantastic! Face id + pin! yea!
 Then we figure out we can simply login with user/pass, and there is not way to enable mfa. Why? what&#x27;s the point of even implementing Windows hello for business if you can&#x27;t enforce mfa on user/passwords?
 Then ok, phew... we can hide the login with username/password button but...you can&#x27;t use runas / rdp etc..
 so what is the effing point? Can someone explain me the logic of this?

                              <span>Hello all,
 Seeking advice on handling a growing concern in our organisation regarding cyber security for our board members. They frequently access sensitive information on their personal devices, and their skill level is very worrying. We&#x27;ve recently identified them as the weakest link in our organisation due to the mix of BYO PCs and Macs.
 Has anyone else faced a similar issue? If so, what steps did you take to mitigate the risk and ensure the security of your data?
 Considerations thus far include making 365 read-only when accessed in a browser. We&#x27;ve ruled out supplying a separate device for our organisation as they sit on multiple boards.
 We are considering Netspoke for our org but only in the early stages of this discussion. Could this assist.
 Any suggestions or best practices would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help.

The thing is, my list of disabled users would be short if it didn&#x27;t also include every mail contact from exchange for some reason, and limited to 20 users per page. Is it just me, or is this a giant fuck you to admins who want to make sure their users have MFA enforced, without paying up for the conditional access? Is a filter button really so much of an enterprise feature?

                              <span>Our domain controller went down for good today and I was told to get a new server overnighted, thought nothing of it and ordered a dell R720. I have just started at this new location and the previous IT techs are backing up the server using windows backup and restore service. Its full system back ups.
 I have never done a windows restore this way before (mostly a linux guy) and I am worried about restoring the server to different hardware. Will I run into any issues after a fresh server install and then using windows back up and restore service?

                              <span>Do you guys have any tips on moving from smaller companies to larger ones without taking a pay cut?
 Explanation: I&#x27;ve worked in smaller environments ever since I started in IT 8 years ago. I&#x27;ve worked on a lot of different things but not necessarily deep into a single thing. If I need to know more about something I can read documentation and/or use Google and solve the issue. The problem is this doesn&#x27;t seem to be cutting it. Companies want me to know things off the top of my head without doing research. Or some things I am confident I would be able to learn/pick up on fairly quickly. Some of this is my poor interviewing skills which I am working on. For example I interviewed for a Tech specialist 3/Jr Sys Admin roll and the feedback I got at the end of the interview was that they thought I had the skills of a level 1 tech. 
 So I guess my question is what have you guys done to build your &quot;jack of all trades&quot; job history into something that works at a larger company.

 This is occurring in edge and it is all under a single extension&#x27;s directory that is an extension available on the chrome store. 
 Renaming the profile will create a new one they can sync to and then I delete the old, but I have no idea what is causing the file to get that large in only 3 days. 
 Anyone encountered this before?

                              <span>Planning a file server migration from a 2008 server hosted in ESXi to a 2022 server hosted in Hyper-V. 
 We are slowing trying to move everything off of ESXi and on to Hyper-V
 Going to use the MS storage migration service. About 2.5TB 
 Right now the drive holding all of the data is on a virtual disk added to the VM via ESXi.
 My question.
 Is it best to just add a virtual disk on the new server in Hyper-V and copying all the data there?
 Or is there any benefit of connecting the new storage volume via iSCSI to the new server and then copying all the data there? 
 Only benefit I can think of is that if the file server had an issue we can In theory connect the drive to another server via iSCSI.
 However I know I can just mount the virtual disk to another server via Hyper-V
 Little background on the environment, have a Hyper-V cluster going with a clusters storage via a Nimble SAN.
 I am also planning a doing a replication of the server to a offsite location using Veeam.
 Thank you all in advance for your input please comment if I am maybe not going at this the right way or if there is a better way too got to accomplish this.

Naturally, I&#x27;m extemely hesistant to give those creds to anyone non-technical, without reviewing an understanding &quot;why&quot; it has to be a global admin account, how is that data used (is it passed through, is it captured, who knows).

The 2x 5.25 drives work and so does the Plus Development 20mb Hard Card. They built things to last back then. I think we could drop a daisycutter on those systems and they wouldn&#x27;t miss a beat.

                              <span>We just onboarded a CISO who has requested that I get an MDM for employee owned cellphones so we can wipe company data from those devices, even though we are fully SaaS. I am running Mosyle to manage my Mac clients and Intune to manage my Windows devices. I know that Intune is capable of this with the company portal app, but he is adamant on an containerized solution for cell phone so employees don&#x27;t need to run a VPN or special browser when using the phone. Any suggestions would be welcome.

 The way I&#x27;m reading it, section 2 of the model plan sounds like any device that has a government email on it needs to have Tiktok removed, including personal devices. How will everyone else be managing this?

                              <span>Previous thread
 When last I posted here on the topic, prior to the Christmas break, I was being pressured into shunting all of my IT stuff into a broom closet. My direct supervisor is the 2nd in command for the whole school system, and he became more and more furious over this request as I brought it up to him over our break. He clearly is on my side in this, which means case closed, it&#x27;s not happening. 
 I&#x27;ve chatted up the admin at the high school since on numerous occasions, and it has never once come up in conversation. Having 6 carts full of laptops charging in the room every day has helped, as there would be no space at all for this stuff. Between that, a laminator, a sound system for our gym, and countless spare machines, it would be impossible to fit all that stuff into their proposed &quot;space&quot;, never mind trying to cram a pair of bodies in there with our desks to boot. 
 All in all, I wanted to update everyone to let you all know that it worked, and that I am still master of my domain (puns for days). I know my employees appreciate my hard line I took in this matter, but I also wanted to thank all of you for supporting my choices in this matter. It&#x27;s one of my highest rated posts on here, and I got a lot of great feedback from members of this sub. IT people deserve better than the crap we get from most people, and all the IT folks I talk to, even in conversations today, agree with me. We are not often treated with respect and dignity, but I&#x27;m not going to let that happen on my watch, with my staff, for as long as I am employed here. 
 So thanks again, and feel free to comment or message me any questions you might have about working on a First Nations reserve, or in a FN school. I know my living and working situation is unique, so don&#x27;t be shy.

                              <span>We have a user who works in our marketing department. She has access to social media because that is a big part of her job. However, she is using FB Messenger all day and I have been asked to see if there is a way to prove this. We use Barracuda as our web filter but we don&#x27;t inspect SSL traffic. We also have a SIEM but I don&#x27;t think any logs are being generated from using Messenger. Are there any other options or places I can pull this information from?

                              <span>After 10 years with the same company, I was just laid off. This has never happened to me before and it fucking sucks. On the plus side I&#x27;m receiving a good amount of severance. I just wish this didn&#x27;t happen a few months before our second child is due to join us.
 If anyone has any leads for jobs in the greater Boston area, I&#x27;d appreciate it. My title was Sr. Systems Cloud Engineer, heavily using AWS.

                              <span>Got a user who placed a ticket today stating they&#x27;re getting an alert whenever they log into our application. 
 Easy enough let&#x27;s take a look.
 The alert has been going on since 2008 and they&#x27;ve simply ignored it. 
 I was in middle school when this poor lady started having a problem, and she&#x27;s just now submitting a ticket.
 The log entries number in the thousands
 Happy Monday everyone.
 Edit: Adding context here since this is blowing up.
 The user is logging into an application that we host on a remote server, the database which is being used has data from as far back as 1999. The application itself still gets updates to this day. Even when deleted the alert still remains
 Edit 2: We normally would clear this thing out with a script. Problem is ours doesn&#x27;t work for something this large so we&#x27;ve had to contact the vendor.

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;m looking for a kind of &quot;authentication&quot; solution (?)..
 We have a network with about 100 users who are either on a company domain joined device, or on their personal device, but they have a domain account.
 We would like to have people using domain joined devices to connect to our wireless lan and just have their internet working, and if the device is not domain joined/whitelisted there is a login page that allows them to authenticate - and grant access to web based on the user group for example.
 I&#x27;m not even sure what type of solution am I looking for? Is it considered a NAC?

 So today i sat down to investigate, and i figured out that the culprit is the MicrosoftTeamsAddin version, however no search results shows any of these issues..
 But i&#x27;ve replicated the issue on 3 WVD Enviroments.
 MicrosoftTeamsAddin Versions 
  
1.0.22321.3 - borked
 
1.0.22304.2 - borked
 
1.0.22272.2 - borked
 
1.0.22234.1 - borked
 
1.0.22209.4 - borked
 
1.0.22147.1 - ok
 
1.0.20091.2 - ok
 
1.0.19296.2 - ok
 
 Teams Versions 
  
1.6.0.376 - borked - 2 February 2023
 
1.5.0.33362 - borked - 14 December 2022
 
1.5.0.31168 - borked - 2 November 2022
 
1.5.0.28361 - borked - 20 October 2022
 
1.5.0.21668 - borked (1.0.22209.4) - 31 August 2022
 
1.5.0.21463 - ok (1.0.22147.1) - 11 August 2022
 
1.5.0.17656 - ok (1.0.22147.1) - 06 July 2022
 
 Teams is installed with ALLUSER&#x3D;1 and IsWVDEnviroment set to 1 in HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Teams 
 I can also confirm the issue is not present when installed as Current user, atleast not on a normal client. 
 So my question is, have any of you encountered this issue AND resolved it? And can you replicate it?

                              <span>We are looking at ways to try to reduce the attack surface of on our LAN. To that end, we currently have communication between client workstations blocked so they can only communicate with servers.
 We&#x27;ve tried to go further by even reducing that to only necessary services. For example, we&#x27;ve blocked client workstations from communication with servers via SMB ports 139 and 445 (obviously with a few exceptions such as our file server and Domain Controller).
 Now, running our last port scan, I see we still have port 135 open from workstations to servers. Can I safely block that?
 My understanding is it is used for RPC and remote management. Ideally what I am trying to set up is to block all remote management like RDP, WinRM, etc to my servers from ordinary client workstations and only allow it from a bastion host.
 I know you should not block it between servers like DCs because that will break replication. But what about blocking it from client workstations? Is that safe to do?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Bought new IBM Flash System 5035. Set it up, tested it out. Our previous storage was with HDD drives, the new one is with SSD drives.
 The results: https://imgur.com/a/LlazOTr
 I don&#x27;t have much experience with storage, but 100MB/s seq write seems kind of slow, especially for SSD? I understand that we bought entry level storage, but shouldn&#x27;t it able to outperform our 6 year old storage with HDD disks?
 The new storage is configured with raid 6, compression and deduplication, connected with FC. When testing storage speed without compression and deduplication the results are little bit better, but it doesn&#x27;t max out CPU in any case.

                              <span>I have a VM running with Postfix and a catch-all address, i.e. I receive all emails to all users sent to my domain.
 I would like to receive as many spam emails as possible in order to gain knowledge from them. I.e. I set up a website where email addresses are placed, spread them on social media, on Github, etc., just to name a few examples, so they get scraped. I&#x27;ve also subscribed to shady newsletters, but without clicking the confirmation link. However, I have had only moderate success with this.
 Ultimately, it&#x27;s exactly the opposite of what you&#x27;d normally want: to not be on the spammers&#x27; radar. I want to be right on the spammers&#x27; radar and on their mailing lists.
 Do you have any suggestions, further ideas on what to try to get spammers to acquire my email addresses and send spam there as well.

 We have a site, where machines enable metered connection when connected to the LAN network - and I&#x27;m not sure why. Any idea why metered connection would be enabled automatically? this is not Grou Policy related, no other machines do this unless they are actually on a tethered connection. 
 i think its a meraki network onsite but I am waiting confirmation

 SPF, DMARC and DKIM are all setup, but I obviously cannot impact a recipients inbound policy. 
 Asides from reaching out to third parties to accommodate the change, is anyone aware of any other measures we can take to reduce misdelivery?

                              <span>Recently I have found myself to be a possible victim of a data leak, when a UK based car dealership suffered a ransomware attack. The data that has possibly been taken includes contact details, dates of birth, vehicle details, ID documents (such as passports and driver’s licences), National Insurance numbers (in limited cases) and bank account details.
 https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-scotland-business-64488013 
 Fuck Me. 
 I have done the usual, cancelling cards and passports, keeping an eye on my accounts but I thought I would send a Subject access request to Arnold Clark, to maybe see what data they could have lost, knowing full well that they would struggle to fulfil it BUT hoping against all hope I would get something. 
 I received a quick boilerplate response, explaining their situation and how they can&#x27;t help right now BUT &quot;we&#x27;d ask that you provide a copy of your I.D. (either Driving License or Passport) to enable us to verify your details&quot;
 Fuck No.

 However, we&#x27;re still running a few Windows 2003 machines which can&#x27;t be phased out yet at this moment. Will those machines still be able to authenticate to the domain?

                              <span>Hi, looking for something that will help accomplish the following without being cumbersome to administrate- it&#x27;s a large organisation and needs change regularly.
 Require a system that will serve a responsive dynamic intranet homepage, with links and menu items for different audiences within the organisation.
 The ability to create and easily manage templates of different link sets for AD user groups (and combinations of groups if possible). We have Azure AD.
 Allows panels to be embedded, serving other pages from our domain eg. KPI info, outstanding tasks etc.
 Bonus points if it already has MS integrations eg. Email, calendar, but not essential.
 Maybe I&#x27;m searching the wrong terminology but I&#x27;m not finding a turnkey solution for what I&#x27;ve got in mind which I find surprising.
 We have SharePoint but not a fan of the general look &amp; feel so something that builds on this may suffice, but managing SharePoint list items for the different audiences isn&#x27;t my preferred route for this.
 Welcome your experiences and recommendations.

                              <span>I’m currently in college to get my Bachelors in IT for SysAdmin. I am learning about network services but am struggling to understand Active Directory, and specifically the difference between Azure AD and on-prem AD.
 First, it’s my understanding that Active Directory provides directory and account permissions management. Is this correct?
 Secondly, as I understand it, both do the same thing except that Azure AD is hosted the cloud while on-prem AD is hosted on a local server. Is this correct?
 Can someone explain the main differences between these?
 Thank you all for your help!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve inherited a domain that has a two way trust with another forest. I&#x27;ll call these AD.foo.bar and BD.foo.bar When users are created they are created in the AD domain. For reasons we want to mange our environment with a different domain. We created the domain BD and a two way trust between them. In the BD domain I can create groups, add users from AD to these groups, authenticate computer logins, most of the things I would expect to be able to do. However we have a couple web applications that can do authentication from Active Directory which want a base DN for users and groups. This is where I run into the problem. The base DN for users something like OU&#x3D;company,DC&#x3D;AD,DC&#x3D;foo,DC&#x3D;bar While the DN for users is OU&#x3D;company,DC&#x3D;BD,DC&#x3D;foo,DC&#x3D;bar
 My question, is there a good way around this kind of problem? Is it worth trying to copy users between domains or is there something here that I might totally be missing?

                              <span>Hi Sysadmins!
 I ran into a problem which may cause some serious privacy issues, and i havent found any solutions on the internet.
 The problem is as follows, we have a user, he opens the office365 outlook app and checks the inbox of a shared mailbox.
 After checking, he presses on a new email as he decides to mail a client of ours, types the email etc and as last step he goes to the options field and checks the from adres, it shows his personal work email. He sends the mail to our client.
 However, now the mail he has send is showing up in the shared mailbox sent items. Every user can now read the mail in send items. It shows the personal from adres from our user. For me this is 100% reproducible, as i take the same steps. I would expect the reciever to get the mail as send on behalf of the shared mailbox, but to the reciever it shows as a mail recieved by the personal mailbox. The header of the mail also has no sign what so ever from the shared mailbox. 
 Now this is kinda a red flag, as this would mean that user in our organisation might think he is typing a private message to someone else, only to show up in the sent items of the shared mailbox..
 What am I missing? Sorry in advance if it&#x27;s a bit jibbrish or bad gramma , I will edit the post to clarify or edit Grammer if needs be

                              <span>We plan to upgrade our File Server Failover Cluster from Server 2016 to Server 2019. It consists of 2 Nodes, Functional Level is 2016. 
 I read these 2 articles:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/failover-clustering/upgrade-option-same-hardware
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/failover-clustering/cluster-operating-system-rolling-upgrade
 From my understanding, it&#x27;s possible to upgrade without any downtime?
 Like this?: Pause cluster, drain, evict, reformat, and install Server 2019 on one node. Add this node to the cluster and run it in Mixed-OS mode. Then do the same on the other node and lastly run &quot;Update-ClusterFunctionalLevel&quot;. 
 But is that really the most efficient way to do it?
 In the first linked article &quot;Upgrading Failover Clusters on the same hardware&quot; in the overview part it is written:
  
Upgrading the operating system on an existing failover cluster is only supported when going from Windows Server 2016 to Windows 2019. If the failover cluster is running an earlier version, such as Windows Server 2012 R2 and earlier, upgrading while the cluster services are running will not allow joining nodes together. 
  
So what does this mean? It&#x27;s not explained further...
 Lastly, in-place upgrade or new installation?
 Any input is welcome (:

                              <span>hi, so basically i wanted to set up my server so i can only access specific resources (like a website running @ port 443 or an sftp service running @ 22) only when connected to ssh. It should look something like this:
 no_ssh_connection -&gt; no access to services,
 ssh_connection -&gt; access to let&#x27;s say everything
 is there any possibility to do this? and i don&#x27;t mean any tunnels to access a specific webserver or so, i mean the specific host i am connecting to. 
 Cheers :)

                              <span>Hello,
 we are starting with a central log management server and like to extend this later on to a siem solution.
 ATM we are enable more logs on Active Directory. Now the Security Log Protocol on our domain controller fills up quite fast. About 500k events per day. The problem is, that the domain controller become unresponsive some times. 
 How do you deal with this problem? Of course i could raise the cpu and ram on the virutal dc, but it seams that the eventlog services is single threaded. 
 We are using the elastic stack and nxlog as log shipper.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Just looking for some advice on best practice. Noticed a lot of devices not updating on the WSUS server so ran a report to highlight which ones do not currently have 22H2 on them due to the impending EOL for 21H2 and this lead to me checking what my predecessor had been doing with inactive/disused devices.
 Turns out they are all moved into an OU on AD rather than being deleted/removed.
 Is this normal practice? I&#x27;m inclined to just remove anything that hasn&#x27;t logged in for over 1 year (with exceptions)

                              <span>Hi team,
 Anyone has experience dealing with error similar to the below?
 ​
 ERROR 2 (0x00000002) Copying NTFS Security to Destination File \\filesvr\file.txt
 The system cannot find the file specified.
 Below is the robocopy command that I use.
 ROBOCOPY \\bgr-fp01\f$\data\ G:\data\ /MIR /Sec /SECFIX /XA:SH /XJD /copy:DATSOU /MT:64 /R:1 /W:5 /LOG:%LOG%
 ​
 When taking a look at the above example file, I do not have permission to view the folder/files nor I can see what NTFS/Shared permissions that are set.
 If I take ownership of the folder/subfolder/files, and provide myself full permission to the folder/files, then I won&#x27;t get the above ERROR 2...
 ​
 There are a lot of the above errors shown in the robocopy log as there are quite a large amount of data to be copied to new file server. Does it mean that I have to take ownership of the top folder including any sub folder/file and gave myself permission to all these files in order to avoid the above error? 
 ​
 Is there another way to do this? Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks.

                              <span>I work as a Sys Admin and have a AS in CSIS from a local college where I live. Long term I would like to get a BA in a foreign language and work in a different country (China). What types of jobs should I be looking for once I finish this degree that are overseas and also in the IT field? Ideally I would still be working for a US company and remain a citizen of the US but either live overseas or travel there a lot.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Quick and easy from a random conversation today with a client/IT Tech who asked why this is not possible; 
 Client/IT - Purchased a lot of Windows 10 HOME devices (dont ask why)
 Client/IT has staff using E3 and E5 licenses
 Client/IT wants to purchase a single Windows 10 Pro license and use it to upgrade all HOME devices to PRO and then join the device to Azure to make it change from Pro to Enterprise using the single key from before.
 Is this remotely possible and even allowed or they talking hyperbole BS to me ? 
 Note, we do some of their MSP but they have their own inhouse IT who do more comms, radios, rock breaking and digging stuff and its their environment, we just help them out from time to time.

                              <span>Hey everyone, I got hired on as the sole in-house IT staff at a bank in my area with 2 years of IT experience. I was hoping to get some general tips from y’all to help me acclimate to the new role?
 Currently have my A+ and have studied for my Net+ but have not taken it, if that’s any indication of where I’m at. I know I have a lot to learn and I am ready and willing to learn it.

 Took feedback, discussed with my team and this is what I drew up.
 Main Design Considerations:
 1000+ Users.
 20+ different locations.
 Users are rotated between departments and even locations somewhat frequently.
 GPOs currently include:
  
Folder redirection for each location - currently planning to move to DFS but until then, I would apply it based on Site
 
Printer Mappings - will apply it to users based on the group they&#x27;re in (eg.HR users in the &quot;HR&quot; security group get HR printers)
 
Proxy GPO - will apply it based on Site
 
Shared Folder Mapping - apply based on the group the user is in for the respective departments.
 
 The Structure:
 -&gt; Users OU User objects and security groups. Regular user accounts are at the root.
  
 Privileged Users OU -…</span>

                              <span>I’m a system admin managing locations remotely from the companies main office. I do help desk tickets internally, configure and maintain the networking side of things (mostly troubleshooting) set up new devices/servers, deploy new software, etc. I make just under $50k a year, I have a long commute (around an hour) and it’s onsite only. 
 I was offered a support role paying a couple grand more than I currently make, and it’s remote. I’m currently attending college for Cybersecurity. I’ve learned a lot in my role, but it’s a lot during school. 
 Which would be better in your opinion? It would be nice to WFH and make a tad more during school, but after I graduate in a year I’ll be looking for security roles. 
 Thoughts?

 I hope someone can help me out. I&#x27;m searching for a comprehensive guide on setting up Azure Cloud Sync when both the Azure tenant and AD are already in place. Our team is currently facing some difficulties with duplicated users and manual mapping, and any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

 We came across https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/how-to-connect-install-existing-tenant but we are looking for a bit more of a guided walkthrough, maybe a video or something with the steps included.

 Our current CISO area is consistently shooting other IT software requests in the foot. We have a current workflow where they are approving/disapproving software for use within our company, however recently they have denied things that would be free or alternatives to SnagIt (think ShareX or Greenshot), KeePass (they suggested LastPass Enterprise), as well as denied VLC with no available suitable replacement.
 Our IT teams are 100% impacted by these disapprovals and the CISO team are not keeping our asset mgmt team in mind, nor our users in mind. I&#x27;m currently not in a full sysadmin role but we do wear a certain hat in it.
 We&#x27;ve communicated that we want to get these and other software approved as enterprise solutions where the end-user can have 1-2 options for the most common requests we get. Unfortunately, they have legal and the privacy team involved which just seem to align with whatever our CISO says. I&#x27;ve never seen any of the 3 teams contradict. Keep in mind that they are all approved by our Chief Technology Office for security review.

                              <span>TL;DR: add DNS to list of service dependencies for NLA service to solve server Ethernet not being identified as domain.
 Hi r/sysadmin,
 Just wanted to report on an issue i had this morning in case anyone else runs into it.
 Sit:
 Brand new Dell T440 running Windows 2022. All OS and firmware updates applied (thank you iDRAC!)
 System is stand-alone on a LAN2 network leg. No other devices are on the same subnet other than the internal leg of the firewall.
 Installed domain services
 Promoted system to be a DC, reboot, etc.
 Issue:
 Ethernet was showing as public or private but not as Domain. (Single port , 2nd is currently disabled)
 Normal fix of restarting Network Location Awareness and Network list service failed (NL hang)..
 Multiple reboots did not work although i could always log onto the console using the domain credentials.
 ​
 Fixes tried:
 Turned on preference for ipv4 over ipv6
 Downgraded the network drivers, Upgraded the network drivers, played with Ethernet metrics (temp fix only)
 EDIT:
 Set NLA to Delayed start (did NOT help)
 Fix that worked:
 Set a dependency for DNS for the NLA service in the registry.
 Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NlaSvc
 DependOnService -add DNS to the list
 Reboot. Problem solved.
 However the system still says Metered (even though it does not appear to be turned on, can download, full speed tests, etc.). I found references to this problem but no solutions so far if anyone has any ideas.
 Hope this saves someone else some precious time.

The senior guy said, just remove the hard drive out and dump it, all data should not be recoverable. Workstation and laptop, we don&#x27;t have bitlocker enabled. The guy who coordinates with ewaste vendor said, they will destroy and give us certificate. Other day, I picked up a still looks decent workstation and inside still has good RAM, and SSD still has terminated employees data . It&#x27;s a whole mess. No one really care.. I have an idea of donating those still decent hardware to local high schools for them to use or build IT lab. But I don&#x27;t know where to start.

                              <span>We are undergoing a re-write of many of our corporate policies and I would like to propose a system for managing these. To date, they are strewn about many different emails, SharePoint sites and Teams. Obviously this isn&#x27;t sustainable.
 I&#x27;m not adverse to buying new software for this, however I generally am not a fan of niche software that isn&#x27;t integrated with the rest of our systems.
 An ideal system would allow for certain people to update policies, but most (or all) employees being able to see the policies. It must either integrate with M365 or just be a solution native to the platform. Ideally folks would be able to track changes to the policy with different versions to see what&#x27;s changed, and maybe get an alert when there is a new or updated policy.
 I figure I could do most of this with SharePoint but feels like I&#x27;d be building a lot of it from scratch. Any thoughts on what works well for you? I assume there are a lot of people frustrated by this and a lot of people thinking to themselves, &quot;If I could build this all over again I&#x27;d do it this way....&quot; so come at me!

 I am effectively trying to implement CAs in Azure to set restrictions on unmanaged devices (personal devices that don’t have Intune on them and are not azure AD joined) such as application level restrictions blocking download/print, requiring more frequent mfa, no persistent browser sessions, etc.
 Any info would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>First of all, here is a layout of this site:
 ​
 3 poweredge 730&#x27;s, ESXi 6.5
 A NAS Datastore using iSCSI
 1 isolated network switch for communications between the hosts/datastores
 ​
 Yesterday, one of our remote sites had the strangest issues, I am still trying to make sense of it.
 Around 10am, I got a message that one of the hosts had a ConnectionStateAlarm. I remoted in and checked vsphere and sure enough, one of the three hosts at that site had a connection state issue. I acknowledged the alarm and checked the VPN circuit. It was pegged out (some type of NAS backup was running, this is not unusual). I cancelled the backup and the circuit went back to a normal state.
 I was thinking that host 1 would come back but it never did. I tried signing into ESXi through the web interface for the host, but the connection would time out on the page after putting in my credentials and hitting login. Tried SSH and I would get a connection refused. Logged in through iDRAC, rebooted the host. It came up without issue.
 So then, this happens on another host, we will call it host 2. Same deal, same site. I also cannot log into ESXi. I ended up getting into the iDRAC and rebooting the host. When it came up, it resynced and all was well. 
 FAST FORWARD AN HOUR LATER.
 I get an alarm that the third host is down and that an HA Event had failed. I logged in, one of my datastores is inaccessible and the third host is now down. This one, I cannot even get into the iDRAC, web interface or SSH.
 I got someone that was near the site to go and reboot the host manually from the rack, it came back up without issue. As for the datastore, I went into the connection &amp; multipathing screen and had to manually mount it back to the first 2 hosts that we rebooted.
 All is back up and no alarms. I had generated support bundles to have VMWare check on this monday. Wow what a Saturday.

                              <span>I have Zebra ZD421 label printer, and it has some serious print slowness issues when labels are printed through Server 2022.
 The printer is set up using the RAW mode, and the port is standard port 9100.
 The driver is &quot;Generic / Text Only&quot; It might take 10s to 60s or more to print labels.
 It also stops regularly between labels to think about what to do next.
 Should this device use port RAW or LPR to get optimal efficient printing speed?
 I also see some weird TCP handshake issues in the firewall logs. Not sure is it related to this issue... 
 Does somebody have special black magic sorcery skills to the Zebra printers?

                              <span>Sorry if this is the wrong community.
 I am trying to use Microsoft Office (mainly Word, Excel, Outlook) on my personal computer, not for production purposes. I do not want to pay hundreds of dollars for a license. 
 I&#x27;ve purchased a Microsoft Office Home &amp; Business for Mac 2021: Lifetime License from FatKidDeals (an Amazon affiliate) for my Macbook for $29.99. I assume this is a reputable site and the license is legal. However, they do not have the deal available for Windows.
 I&#x27;ve seen lifetime license deals on sites like CDKeys and ProductKeys. Are these legal? Are they worth the risk?
 Is there any other way to obtain an affordable lifetime license for Windows? I&#x27;m open to family packs for 1-5 devices as well since I have multiple devices in my home.

 Is there (1) an android mobile app or, (2) a simple windows app/script 
 that can perform simple server tasks like resetting passwords, unlocking accounts, dhcp, restarting the server etc all from your phone. These are admin tasks that are perfomed multiple times a day in our org
 Logic: Type username e.g John Doe If user found then present actions -reset account password to XYZ -lock/disable account -unlock account -and dhcp functions add/modify/delete -etc

                              <span>Hey all,
 I&#x27;ve been working in IT for about 15 total years in some capacity. (Freelance and Professional or Contract) Education: Associates in Computer Science /COMPTIA A+ / Network+ / Security+
 I&#x27;ve been working in Data Center roles and lower level engineer roles for some extremely large companies over the last 6 years now and my salary has increased by about $19/hr from 2018 until now. 
 I started out at $11/hr in 2016 Most recent role - $33/hr by end of 2022
 About to start a new job in a week or two, but I got blindsided by another offer from a different company while I&#x27;m waiting for my equipment in the mail, sliding me about $15,000 more a year.
 I&#x27;ve been making between $55,000 - $72,000 per year through my last 3/4 positions I&#x27;ve held and have gained a lot more experience during these last few years as well. 
 I&#x27;m currently about to start a new job, I am being offered $70,000/yr and about to begin onboarding/training for this role before Feb 15th. However I was just offered another role through a different company, fully remote sysadmin for about $85,000/yr. 
 My questions are mainly... based on anyone else&#x27;s experience in sysadmin work in the Midwest, should I try to aim for closer to $90k based on my experience? 
 Should I just shut up and take the money?? Or should I aim higher for somewhere between $90k-$100k?
 (This is my first time specifically doing work with a &quot;sysadmin&quot; title, but been performing the same work through other roles I&#x27;ve held in recent years)
 I&#x27;ve looked up some Glassdoor avg salaries for the title but it was a pretty wide range, something like 55k-120k/yr?
 If anyone can help me out with this I&#x27;d really appreciate it as I&#x27;m trying to pursue making a big change in my life and move towards settling down and building a family with my fiancee. Whatever role will end up offering more in terms of salary and job happiness will be more important to me.

 I&#x27;m currently working at a job where I was supposed to tend to the administrative network. I&#x27;ve since been given the task of organizing the production networks, too. It&#x27;s a grand mess. 
  
We are heavily VLAN&#x27;ed for security reasons.
 Mix of VMWare and stand-alone servers.
 Clients are a mix of domain servers, non-domain servers, azure AD clients and local-account only clients with either no password or simple shared username/password combinations. I also have vendor servers that I don&#x27;t inherently have any pull over - and no clear service contracts. Given that we&#x27;re going to need to conform to the new NIS2 standards - I have my work cut out for me. 
 Running on-premises Active Directory for the administration network, only servers are joined. Clients are either thin clients or lap…</span>

                              <span>I am about to get fiberoptic installed at a rural location. Mobile signal is unreliable at best and sometimes we lose electricity for days and with an elderly parent living there, access to emergency service is a primary concern. Especially as we will have to give up our copper line. 
 My understanding is that as long as we keep power supplied to the ONT, phones and networking in the house will work. My first instinct was to buy the beefiest UPS we can afford, but I have had a UPS die in a puff of smoke. It would be a cruel twist of fate if the backup battery that we installed to maintain emergency communications started a fire and harmed my mother.
 I notice that there are UPSs that are marketed specifically for telecom equipment, such as those listed here:
 https://www.cyberpowersystems.com/products/telecom/indoor/ 
 I notice that these are rather expensive given their output compared to UPSs sold for computers. Is there something special about them? 
 - For example are they optimized for providing lower power over more time? This would make sense for network equipment, whereas computer UPSs are made to keep a desktop computer going at full power for just enought time to shut down. Or would a bigger UPS designed for a computer simply last longer when powering low-power devices?
 ​
 - Might there be safety/fire precautions on these that aren&#x27;t on regular UPSs? 
 - Any other reasons I might pay extra per watt of power output for one of thse &quot;telecom&quot; UPSs?

                              <span>So Im newer to this side of things, but I need some help. I help with some minor development work for a small community of gamers. The current game that Im working with needs a small public facing file host for a patcher. Ive tried dropbox, google drive, and even github, but I cant seem to get the damn thing to communicate with those. 
 It&#x27;s been suggested that I use a small vps with a public facing file folder. Problem is I have no idea how to set that up, and less of an idea as to who to host with. The files themselves are a total of maybe 10-15mb, but will be downloaded multiple times a day. 
 Thoughts? Suggestions?

                              <span>Good evening,
 A few months ago, I replaced a bunch of Catalyst 2960S switches in our environment with new Cisco 9200L series switches. The swapover went well in general, but recently our users have started complaining about intermittent VOIP quality issues. I&#x27;m assuming a simple QoS policy will resolve the issue, but I&#x27;m having some issues understanding how I should go about it.
 We have two switch stacks. Three switches in a stack in one building with our ISP routers, two switches in a stack in our other building. A 10G fiber uplink connects the switch stacks between buildings.
 We have a VOIP Vlan set to Vlan 100. Most user access ports have both the VOIP Vlan and general data VLAN (200) configured. Ex:
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/3 switchport access vlan 200 switchport mode access switchport voice vlan 100 spanning-tree portfast 
 Our phones are older Polycom devices, not Cisco.
 I&#x27;ve read up on Cisco Auto QoS, but I&#x27;ve also read it&#x27;s not the most efficient way of implementing QoS. Especially in an environment that isn&#x27;t using Cisco phones. I started a support case with Cisco, but they just sent me the Auto QoS documentation I already have...
 Can anyone help me understand what should be done here? Is there a way I can just tell the switch &quot;prioritize anything on Vlan 100&quot;? What about the uplink between switches? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;ve always been a loner and social outcast. I really want a job that allows me to work by myself. I hate having to socialize with people and talking to coworkers. Is a noc position or any other networking position a viable option for me?

                              <span>For those that have had a ‘traditional’ networking career trajectory, meaning working in a NOC -&gt; planning/implementation -&gt; architect, do you think working in the NOC was fundamental to your growth?
 For context, I’m a networking grad in Canada that was hired at a big bank on the network provisioning/management team (which I think is a tier/level above the NOC), and so I’m wondering if I’m missing out on valuable networking experience not starting in a NOC.
 I do have my CCNA and I can confidently say I know the fundamentals, but will it be a big hindrance that I didn’t start out in a NOC. Or will working on my current team expose me eventually to the common and fundamentals of enterprise networking through implementing changes/sitting in on meeting, etc.
 Would also love to hear from those who have not worked in a NOC and how your career has gone.

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;m a novice when it comes to networking. I do TV installing and other entry level tech needs but I have a client who needs a new TV that works at a university that uses WPA2 enterprise I believe. You select the wifi network and it requires a username and a password. 
 From what I was reading is it any device that supports 802.11 and up supported but I could very well be wrong. They are needing a new TV and would like to connect it for smart features. 
 Hope this made sense and appreciate any insight

The cabling guys installed a bunch of ports and didn&#x27;t number them and I need to connect those ports to the switch which is on the vlan for that purpose.

                              <span>I am trying to simulate a distributed fault-tolerant system consisting of multiple nodes. Each node runs a set of tasks or processes. Tasks communicate with each other by passing messages over the nodes&#x27; gates. I want to simulate a fault-tolerant mechanism where a node can fail and the system reconfigures itself by migrating tasks on the faulty node to other healthy nodes. I already developed an algorithm for migrating tasks but I want to test it with OMNeT++. 
 ​
 In the NED file, I have defined the network with the different nodes as submodules and tasks as submodules of the nodes (sub-submodules). But I can&#x27;t connect the tasks with each other. 
 How can I simulate this behavior? Is there a better simulation tool than OMNeT++ for this use case?
 Thanks.

                              <span>In this question we will explore the dynamics of two flows using the AIMD (additive increase, multiplicative decrease) and later AIAD (additive increase, additive
 decrease) algorithm instead of AIMD. Consider the topology shown in which two hosts A and B are sending packets to D through router R. 
 The bottleneck link in the path from R to D runs at 10 MB/s (i.e. 10 Megabytes per second). The RTTs from A to D and B to D are 100 ms. Assume that both A and B can
 communicate with R instantaneously and with arbitrarily large rate. Assume that each packet has a length of 1250 bytes and the buffer on router R can hold 200
 packets.
 Suppose that at time t &#x3D; 0, host A has a congestion window of 999 packets, B has a congestion window of 0, and R’s buffer is empty. You should assume that packet
 drops are always experienced by the flow with more packets in flight. You should assume that each flow updates its congestion window after each RTT, decreasing it if
 any packet was dropped, and increasing it otherwise.
 AIMD: We first consider the evolution of the system when each flow is governed by AIMD, in which the congestion window grows by being incremented and shrinks by
 being halved (rounding down). In roundtrips 0 through 3, the system evolves as shown in the table below with host A exceeding the given congestion window size and
 accordingly reducing CWND to half in the next iteration. 
 Now, suppose that instead we are using an AIAD protocol. In this case, every drop decreases the congestion window by 5 packets (to a minimum of 1 packet) instead
 of halving the congestion window. What is the congestion windows size of host A at t &#x3D; 300 RTTs? Give your answer in packets. 
 The solution states, it should be 300 but I do not understand why and there is nothing else provided.

                              <span>Hi.
 I am looking for 3com 4500G 3CR17762-91 48 port switch firmware. Although I can find this switch on HPE site, but no firmware is available for download. Current firmware on switch flash is s3q05_02_00s168p20.app
 Does any one have such ?

 What book would be good / easy to understand on such TCP stack internals - mainly what current Linux/Windows deployments might be doing, so not ancient history but also not bleeding edge research?
 TCP/IP Illustrated, Comer&#x27;s Internetworking with TCP/IP, Tanenbaum&#x27;s Computer Networks, or something else?

                              <span>So I my ISP assigns local private IP address to devices on the network, I found that by checking the IP address assigned to my phone&#x27;s ccmni0 interface which I believe is the one used to connect to the network.
 And so I tried sending a message to my other phone (which uses a SIM card from the same network provider as the other, so I assumed they are on the same network) using the local IP assigned to it. I was expecting to receive the message on the device but didn&#x27;t, that&#x27;s why I suspect the reason might be because they use different cellular technology (one 3G and the other 4G).
 Please tell me if my suspicion is true or not. And guide me if I have done anything wrong.

                              <span>Hello, I wanted to know if it&#x27;s possible to connect a 5g router to 2 network switches, each switch has up to 20 connections.
 Can you guys recommend me a 5G router that handles such speed, my internet provided suggested 2 options (I&#x27;m doubting it handle the load I will be having )
 https://www.htc.com/eu/5g/htc-5g-hub/
 and
 https://consumer.huawei.com/en/routers/5g-cpe-pro-2/
 Would these options be able to handle the load, or should i get a higher end option?
 Edit: this is a temporary option provided by my internet provided until they provide my business with fibre connection

                              <span>So I know this may not be a topic to put here but I figured I can scan through the trolls lol. 
 I left a big corp network job to go to a smaller company for a &quot;promotion&quot; to network engineer with a few K more money. Now the company I left is asking me to come back. They are offering me more than I have now and a true engineer position. I have only been with the new company for 2 months and have never been a job hopping person. I loved where I left, but with some political work there may be some potential for the new company. Tho it was going from CLI to Meraki Dashboard. I am stuck as to what I should do to progress my career. I have an engineer I am working with now who has been here for 10+ years with no progression. 
 I guess my question is should I leave for even more experience in cli with my last company or should I just stay for now and try to change this companies&#x27; climate and maybe learn more meraki?

(The building isn’t complete yet, so I had them purchase the correct Nexus 93180YC-FX3s for their data center core so that way they can mirror our design/configs.) Anyway, I told management I’ll repurpose these expensive ass switches for our other network we are going to be rebuilding, so they’ll be serving as a datacenter core to a set of two 9300 access switches one for each floor. Originally, I had planned on just running a traditional HSRP …</span>

                              <span>Having a heck of a time resetting my Cisco Catalyst 3560G password for my tech bench switch. It appears I had some issues setting new AAA security config on it.
 Anyways, I tried the classic pressing &quot;mode&quot; button during power-on. Despite me giving all my might and pressing/holding for upwards of a minute, the switch does not seem to enter the &quot;switch:&quot; prompt. It always boots normally. I tried different permutation of 5 seconds, 15, seconds, pressing mode when I unplug power, then continuing to hold when I plug power back in, etc.
 I explored other alternatives by breaking the boot. But that doesn&#x27;t seem to work either - when I&#x27;m consoled in, using firstly PuTTY, then Teraterm and sending break commands didn&#x27;t work either.
 When it boots, I do see a message: The password-recovery mechanism is enabled.
 But it continues to boot normally into a configuration of a password I cannot remember.
 Any guidance would be appreciated.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m still new to networking and haven&#x27;t experienced too much with Public DNS records. 
 but for information, the design is that there are 2 DNS servers setting between the Router and the Firewall. The Router is in front so the structure is ISP - Router - DNS - Firewall - Internal Network. 
 This external DNS keeps the Host and only Host A files that lets the internet know that website A is IP whatever for the college. 
 I believe the DNS servers forward the traffic to Quad9 or something like that, not sure why, but if some one can assist to the reason, I&#x27;m sure its a verification method or something to proof that we are the actual college we are advertising or to tell other larger DNS providers know who we are if some one form another state tries to reach our website. 
 So on to my question. Is there a better way? I would like to move our records off site to something like cloud flair. However I set up a meeting with them and they said the minimum they covered was for websites that hit 1 million hits per month. Obviously its a community college in a rural area so we get around 17,000 hits. Then they wanted $20,000 a year. 
 Now I was trying to keep my cool, but choking inside, so I didn&#x27;t get a chance to clarify, but I think they thought I wanted some of the premium features and such when really I just wanted to host A records so we had a cloud DNS and if that&#x27;s just a free thing or if we have to pay a fee. I think it was confusion because the prices on the website did not match up to what they were telling me. 
 Can any one clarify if Cloud Flair is free to host records and all I have to do is just verify that we are who we say we are? 
 or really any better solution to external DNS hosting or is it fine the way we have it set up?

                              <span>I’m curious what everyone’s day to day is like in their role. I’m a Network Administrator in the Marine Corps with 7ish years of experience and debating on leaving once my contract is up in a couple of years because I don’t want to move around anymore. I’m just worried I’m not going to enjoy what I do once I get out because currently I get to work on a lot of equipment and it’s honestly a lot of fun. I’m also curious if anyone has a role/job somewhat similar to what I do? For instance, at a typical training exercise I get to setup an equipment string supporting about 50-200 users which includes a Satellite Transmissions System or fiber connection and connect it to my router which connects via DMVPN to a NOC and pull services from there. I also get to setup/configure all switches to other offices (tents) to end devices and some encryption equipment and VoIP thrown in there as well. Usually it’s me and 1-2 other people doing all of this and we get a lot of time configuring which I enjoy. So I guess I’m just curious if anyone gets exposed to a lot of different equipment or do you mainly stick to a specific area of configuration? Thanks!

                              <span>Experts,
 We are looking to setup something unique and get two firewalls setup behind our Comcast EDI. The challenge we are having is we need to route are usable block of /27 to different WAN /29 address on two firewalls.
 Comcast has given us
 P2P IP:xxx.xxx.xxx.232/29 Gateway (.233) Comcast router Customer Layer 3 (.234)Customer Useable IP’s: xxx.xxx.xxx.235 – xxx.xxx.xxx.238
 and we have Usable EDI Static Range: yyy.yyy.yyy.225-.254 and this is 255.255.255.224 or /27
 I think that Comcast sends our Usable range to the xxx.xxx.xxx.234 address. 
 What I have tried is to assign the .234 to a VLAN on our Dell N4000 switch with routing enabled. Then I assigned .235 and .236 to WAN interface on each firewall.
 Our issue comes when trying to setup a route in the table to send yyy.yyy.yyy.226 to the .235 ip. We are going to have to send different usable to the different firewalls. The switch complains that the rout is invalid, which makes sense since its a different network.
 Lots of people suggest getting an EdgeRouter X, would that let me do this?
 Any suggestions on getting our switch to do this type of routing?
 ​
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;m trying to get a trunk of my VLANs 2-3 to an ESXi host. 
 The VM is connected to VLAN 2 in the vSwitch on the host. I can not ping any device in the VLAN.
 Everything works fine if the port is set to access VLAN 2 and the mapping for VLAN 2 is removed on the vSwitch port group. 
 This is the config of the port on the switch:
 !Command: show running-config interface Ethernet1/28 !Running configuration last done at: Sat Feb 4 17:32:40 2023 !Time: Sat Feb 4 17:32:47 2023 version 9.2(4) Bios:version 07.66 interface Ethernet1/28 switchport mode trunk switchport trunk allowed vlan 2-3 spanning-tree port type edge trunk 
 This is the config of the vSwitch:

                              <span>Hey guys I&#x27;m looking for a bit of advice and/or general opinions about a position that I am being considered for.
 To give a little background my current role is Datacenter Infrastructure Engineer which honestly is a glorified DC tech with a few more responsibilities thrown into the mix imo. I&#x27;ve worked as a Nocc tech for an a local MSP/ISP prior to that for about 1.5 years and before that as a Field technician for ATT for 5 years. My current role is really a direct mix of all the experience I&#x27;ve gathered so far so I feel like I&#x27;m steadily moving in the right direction but a little confused about what I really want to do next. I&#x27;ve always considered going straight into a Network Engineering role but honestly I enjoy the excitement of a more operational production support role.
 The positio…</span>

                              <span>Hello,
 I have recently been trying to find out a deep dive into what exactly networking ports are. This is regarding TCP and UDP ports.
 Whenever I search what exactly are networking ports, I see explanations about how they are a way to identify a service. 
 I have not seen explanations on how this is achieved.
 When a server receives a request on port 22, the TCP/IP stack inspects the destination port, and sees the number 22 there. Is the TCP/IP stack configured in such a way that each port number must be associated with a certain service, like if the number is 22, then forward the request to the sshd service?
 After the TCP/IP stack inspects the port number, will it forward the request to the relevant service - sshd in this case?
 I have thought of ports as &quot;gates&quot; to remotely access a service. Each service has its own PID, but this PID stays local, so ports are a way to access these services remotely. We won&#x27;t be able to remotely access the service by its PID. But we can access the service if there is a TCP/IP stack that does the forwarding of request based on the destination port number?
 The questions above are just my own explanation of how ports are bound to services, and how the TCP/IP stack assists in forwarding the request to the relevant service. If anybody has knowledge in this, it would be great for someone to share it.
 Cheers

                              <span>I walked into a situation where only LC fiber connections exist. My problem, not a single device used will support fiber in the office spaces. I’m not seeing the benefit of this now that I’ll have to purchase hundreds of media converters and patch cables just to make anything function. Can someone help explain the logic. We also only have a 1gb circuit. The area roughly has 50 offices, single floor, roughly 10k sqft.
 Also, I fully understand the reliability, scalability, security, future proofing aspect. What I’m not getting is why fiber was chosen as the sole connection method when the devices we support aren’t there yet.

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;ll to explain this best as iI can.
 I&#x27;ve got two WAN connections in a failover arrangement:
 WAN1 FTTP
 WAN2 5G failover
 VLANs:
 1 10 20 30 200
 In the UI dashboard its not giving accurate info on how much data is flowing between the different vlans... is this normal?
 so lets say the sky glass is active and pulling 20Mbps I would expect it to show this via the IoT vlan but it does not.
 also the traffic analysis tab does not show hardly any data for any nodes connected. for example i have run about 10 speed tests and downloaded a 1.1gb iso from my pc, yet it only shows 7.86MB of data logged.
 is this just a bug with the EdgerouterX?
 TIA
 ​
 Edit: so this is apparently because the interfaces only show the overhead of the vlans and not total traffic.

 This is a silly question but I need to order some armored fiber. The mPOE side I know is SC but on the server closet side it seems like Fortinet SFP transceivers only accept LC. So would I get the cable made to be SC to LC?

Whenever, a user is logged in using a smart card or tries to log in using a smart card, certain services can no longer be restarted, such as the print spooler. We get error 1747, the authentication service is unknown. Nothing we have tried has resolved the issue except not installing ActivClient. The most interesting thing is that machines that were loaded with 21H2 that already have ActivClient installed are them work fine if we do an in-place upgrade on them to 22H2. The issue only occurs on cleanly loaded machines. Has anyone ever seen anything like this, and is anyone running ActivClient on Windows 11 22H2?

 Sophos firewall and sophos endpoint installed on wall workstations and laptops
 Currently all on a workgroup. 
 File server is backed up to synology rackstation and then backed up to Backblaze. 
 All employees are on a Microsoft business standard subscription. 
 Current System on workgroup for 15 people - 1x windows server 2019 (file share) - 10x Windows 10/11 pcs (work stations for each employee) - 14x window 10 SFF pcs(digital signage) - 8x printers various types - 6x windows 10/11 laptops (same users as workstation users) - 4x windows 10/11 pcs for general use (currently one generic login)
 I was wondering what the best way to manage the multiple computers per employee is and the general access computers. Is it time I created a domain and joined everyone to the domain? If so how would you organize and structure the domain? We definitely want to keep the on-site file share.
 Edit: m365 subscription level

 It replied.
 Here&#x27;s a step-by-step guide on how to migrate user profiles from a Windows Server 2012R2 to Windows Server 2019:
 Backup the old profiles: On the Windows Server 2012R2, open the File Explorer and navigate to the folder where user profiles are stored. This folder is typically located in C:\Users. Right-click on the folder and select &quot;Export&quot; to backup each user profile.
 Copy the profiles to the new server: On the Windows Server 2019, open File Explorer and navigate to the folder where user pr…</span>

                              <span>I need to set up a lab environment for my project, which supports a decade-old legacy system. The objective is to create corresponding setup guides and compile the necessary lab setup resources together for the team&#x27;s future use. Our repository hasn&#x27;t been updated since the system&#x27;s deployment. Right now, I&#x27;m working on the setup of a particular server in the lab, which was only introduced during the system&#x27;s mid-life upgrade. As such, there were no setup documentation for it and I had to reverse engineer the existing server to make guides for it from scratch.
 One of the software deployed in the system is SharePoint Portal Server 2003. It took me a while to realise that the version deployed in production is updated to Service Pack 3, but I only have the base version&#x27;s installer. I searched high and low and haven&#x27;t been able to find the SP3 installer anywhere in my office&#x27;s repositories. The official download link from Microsoft is dead too.
 Does anyone know where I can get this file (likely named SPS2003SP3-kb923644-fullfile-ENU.exe - KB923644), or where I can go to ask? Thanks!

 Long story short, I got a very good job offer to join a good company with a great team (IT colleagues) in May of 2020. It was a step up in my career on a professional level with a chance to expand my skillset and gain new experiences on a different level. To add on with that, the salary was a 40k in-crease on what I was making previously and it was fully remote (company was/has been mainly remote even before the pandemic). From May of 2020 up until December of 2022, everything has been smooth sailing with no major complaints.
 However… Two weeks ago, there was an unusual email from my CEO &amp; HR (not common) that was sent out to all the employees. The basis of the em…</span>

                              <span>Cross posting this from r/askanelectrician since it is specific to server hardware.
 Context:
 I have a server PSU that seems to only work with a C13/C14 cord. The specs of the server PSU are:
 Edit: Here is a picture of the PSU: https://infohub.delltechnologies.com/static/media/9198938f-8c47-5a0e-82d9-6db6a62cd3f7/DAM-ccd92840-c3fa-4d5c-9c55-cf231e6069f4/out/2711.024.jpg
 Max input power: 100 to 240 VAC +/- 10%, single phase
 AC line current: 10.6A @ 100 VAC, 5.3 A @ 200 VAC
 AC Inlet Type: IEC320-C14 (high-line, 200 VAC), IEC320-C20 (low-line, 100 VAC)
 Issue:
 I have a 120V PDU that has NEMA 5-20 receptacles (L5-30 input). The PSU will not power on with a C13/NEMA 5-15 or C13/NEMA 5-20 cord. I want to use this PDU.
 I also have a 200-240V PDU (L6-30 input) with C14 inputs. The PSU works when using a C13/C14 cord in this PDU. I don&#x27;t want to use this PDU.
 Question:
 Can someone give a quick explanation of these power requirements/specs on the PSU? My interpretation is that the PSU supports 120V thus a NEMA 5-15/NEMA 5-20 cable should be enough to power the PSU.
 Am I misinterpreting the specs or does the PSU have some sort of sensing ability to know that an IEC plug is not being used? FWIW, daisy-chaining C13/C14 into C13/NEMA x also doesn&#x27;t work.
 Edit:
 I have talked to Dell about this and they suggested getting a C13/NEMA 5-20P cable. I did and it still didn&#x27;t work.

 Our virtual machines are Azure Virtual Desktop and it seems like they recently just started. All Teams are installed with Teams Universal Installer&quot; or whatever the name is, but even we are having difficulty updating the latest version because the older version and files are stuck on the VM. Like we CANNOT get them off no matter how hard we try.
 We have installed the latest version of the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable. and Remote Desktop WebRTC Redirector Service installer.
 The errors we see on the VM for Teams:
  
Can&#x27;t select any audio/video devices
 &quot;Couldn&#x27;t connect to AVD for media optimization, Audio and video quality may be reduced Talk to your IT admin&quot;
  
Does Teams need to be updated? Does Team just suck? Is this a service issue with Microsoft?

                              <span>Hello r/sysadmin!
 I can&#x27;t wrap up my mind around this. Earlier this week at my workplace I had a iSCSI target from a Synology RackStation RS3614xs+ NAS (DSM 6.2.2-24922) suddenly disconnect overnight on a Windows Server. When I started investigating after noticing the issue, DSM tells me in the storage manager that &quot;There is no volume in your system&quot;. 12-disk RAID6 is fine, alive and healthy, S.M.A.R.T. of all disks displays a &quot;Normal/Healthy&quot; status so nothing to worry about I think (only 1 disk mentioned 1 bad sector at the time after the sudden target disconnect). Storage pool is also operating normally from what DSM shows.
 I can still access the target, the data is still there but this volume &quot;missing&quot; in DSM is getting me a little worried.
 Every other RackStation NAS (configured with iSCSI/LUNs) we have currently running and everything I see on the web says that on a Synology NAS a LUN is located on a volume (like Volume 1) and not straight on a storage pool.
 I&#x27;m no expert in storage topics and still learning but everything I see in my investigation of the issue points in the direction that this is not a normal behavior. I searched on the web for a similar experience and cannot find cases where LUNs point straight to storage pool location instead of like an ext4 volume for example.
 What are your thoughts about this?
 Please let me know if additional context and details (even logs or output of CLI commands) are needed.
 Thanks in advance for your insight, and have a nice day!

Now I have unjoined them from the domain I am having to use certificate based authentication. I am have read that setting primary dns suffix on the Workgroup Hyper-V hosts is a prereq.
 The workgroup is on the same network as the domain controller.
 My question is - should I use the local domain&#x27;s DNS suffix?

 Just in case any of you have them in your fleets. Thankfully, being in edu, we have nothing close to it lol.

                              <span>Not sure if this is the right place to ask this or not. If you know of a different subreddit please let me know. 
 I’ve been tasked with updating our site Content Security Headers. We currently have a couple of old ones on there. Our pen-testers want us to get rid of the one header that is “script-src ‘self’” I figured I would remove that then add in our domain name so that way anything that comes from our site is approved. I have our active CSP headers so when I added our domain it is in a new CSP Report only. But I keep getting the error that the directive name contains one or more invalid characters. I’ve double checked to make sure there wasn’t an exception xtra space or anything and cannot get it to work. This is what I have now:
 Content-securit-policy Script-src ‘self’
 Content-security-policy report only HTTPS://example.com
 This is the first time I have dealt with security headers and cannot seem to figure this out. I’m sure it’s simple but frustrating. Thanks for the help.

                              <span>Many years ago I used to look after some Postfix servers and then 365 came along and all that went away.
 I&#x27;ve got a requirement where I think Postfix would be ideal I just can&#x27;t find/remember the exact term in Postfix for what I want to do so would appreciate a little reminder 😀
 I need a Postfix box on an internal LAN to accept mail from the internal /24 and if it&#x27;s for @domain1.com or @domain2.com to forward it onto a smart host (the smart host will accept and relay from the IP of the Postfix box so no need to authenticate).
 However if it&#x27;s for anythingelse.com I only want it to relay it using the same smart host if it comes from certain IPs within the internal /24.
 So mail from 192.168.1.0/24 to domain1.com or domain2.com &#x3D; accept and relay.
 Mail from 192.186.1.10 and 192.168.10.15 to anydomain.com &#x3D; accept and relay.
 There are no local mailboxes in use.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>A lot of devices and software these days wants to phone home regularly, or even have open channels into them for vendor support teams to check in with.
 Does you org allow that? Ours is generally cautious and doesn&#x27;t, but even so it feels like most companies wouldn&#x27;t really want to send out a vaguely defined set of internal data (usernames, VM names, share/datastore names, project names etc.) and especially uncontrolled external admin access to critical devices.
 What do you do at your org?

 Is there something we missed doing in our admin or something we must trigger to get the new cert onto device (device has been online all week and is communicating AOK with the admin console) or is this on VMWare missing their renewal ?

                              <span>Hey guys,
 Last year I was hired by a company here Denmark to be an IT admin and recently I was given the task to build a troubleshooting lab for the Network/Security engineers.
 The objective of this lab is so that when they face a problem with a customer&#x27;s device (which is in production), they can quickly spin up a VM in our lab environment and run tests on it.
 We will use a single server running VMware EXsi for the VMs.
 Ideally I would like to give the engineers the freedom to create their own VMs using some type of GUI (instead of keeping that extra administrative work for myself), but I also want to restrict them from creating a ridiculous amount of VMs, or assigning a ridiculous amount of resources to the VMs, and Ideally this would all have AAA (so I can know who created what and when).
 What tools do you recommend for a setup like this? This is my first time leading a project like this and I am a bit lost !
 Thank you in advance!

 I already opened a post, for another question. This one is partly a rant, but also partly a call for help.
 This is about an argument I had with my colleague. I don&#x27;t know where he comes up with such ideas.
 We tasked to conceptualize a new ip address concept for our location. We have 200-250 employees, everyone with notebooks and smartphones. In total we come up with 500~ unique ip addresses.
 We don&#x27;t expect to grow much, because we are limited by the size of our offices.
 We have 3 buildings, each with 3 floors. I rather expect, that we will build smaller branched offices in the future, if we ever fill up our current location.
 Thats all fine. Basic stuff. Thats like the 1,2,3 of a sysadmin. I did stuff like that in school and got tasks like this even as an exam …</span>

                              <span>Just curious if anyone can share their solution to keeping their fleets laptops in laptop carts updated.
 We will have a small time frame coming up in the school system with no students or teachers.
 Trying to find a solution to-Have most of the fleet&#x27;s Windows laptops always up to date with their patches and etc.(as close as possible)-Able to keep the laptops updated all the time-Don&#x27;t need staff/us to run to every laptop all the dam time to update it ourselves this takes a really long time. There&#x27;s just too many laptops
 Solution I was thinking- We will go to every laptop this time make sure we push the bios config to power on every Sunday- SCCM will do the updates for us just like how we always been..
 Any recommendations or advice as well from your own solutions that is keeping your laptop&#x27;s updated in their carts? Any GPO&#x27;s that we can push to the laptops as well. The laptops are always plugged with power via the usb-c power adapters. We have ap&#x27;s in every room that has a laptop cart.
 Its just getting tiresome to do all hunt down the ones that hasn&#x27;t been patched manually as the #of laptops is growing and its not all in the same building. Thanks for your help and any advice is welcome.

                              <span>This is a relatively new concept to me. I understand how load balancing will can be used to send requests to multiple servers so that one server is not overloaded. But the part I don&#x27;t understand is how do you make the servers always be duplicates of each other? For example if it&#x27;s cloud storage, one person edits or uploads a new version of the a file, how does the other servers know there was a change? And how do you make sure they are all up to date with the latest changes? 
 I don&#x27;t understand how you setup the replication portion of it. 
 Can someone point me into he right direction to understand this?

                              <span>Good morning everyone,
 I seek for aid in conceptualizing a new network for my company.
 During my conversations with my colleague we came up with the question where to put the default gateway of our subnets.I remember that my old teacher back in school told me, to put the default gateway at the end of a subnet. e.g. 192.168.178.254/24 I can&#x27;t remember why again. Something with growth and expansion of the network. I can&#x27;t get it together anymore.
 Though, from my old companies I know that they all put their default gateway at the beginning of a network, e.g. 192.168.178.1/24
 What do you think? Is there an actual reason for the one or the other, or is it just personal preference?
 Thank you very much!

                              <span>Very weird question I know.
 But I figure if anyone has been around long enough in technology that remembers anything about this, its like Sysadmin and perhaps a handful of Guru&#x27;s here. 
 So from 2018-2020 I worked for a Newspaper IT department in my first real IT job .
 To place our ads we used a certain program and boy howdy this sucker was old.
 I never got a specific timeframe on its age , I heard some staff saying they had seen a version of it or something similar to it when they worked in the 70&#x27;s/80&#x27;s, I knew support for it ended like in 2009 and the interface was pure keyboard based and looked like something something that would not have been out of place on DOS with its blocky text and minimal colors.
 I am fairly certain we were the last company in the world using it, we had to modify it to work on modern Mac OSX and windows machines , run it deep in wineskin.
 The thing was so old, that whenever it crashed or corrupted the staff just installed a fresh zipped copy on the affected workstation and it was so small that you could transfer it quickly, even on a Apple Remote Desktop setup, it transferred in like 10-15 seconds. 
 Now I am not sure if our versions name was changed after all the modifying or all the companies assets were barely online, but when I search for it (mostly to share with people to show them the older stuff I have worked on), all I get is info on cameras or wall mountings.
 ​
 Was curious if anyone knows what I am talking about and its proper name or even some screenshots of it in all of its DOS glory.
 Not a big deal, but I thought I&#x27;d ask

                              <span>I think I really messed up here. I just started my job and I terminated some wall jacks and left a little less then half of an inch of exposed Ethernet cable that is connected to the wall jacks. Do you think this will this cause a lot of interference in a typical office setting? Im really nervous about this and want to ask the pros about this.

                              <span>Can anyone share what it&#x27;s like working for a defense contractor? I&#x27;m in a city with a large military presence and I get hit up by recruiters hiring for defense contractors all the time. 
 I&#x27;m not opposed to working for one but my fear is the bureaucracy and process. I&#x27;m in a very large organization right now and don&#x27;t like the sheer size and complexity of the environment just to get something done. I&#x27;m afraid a defense contractor would be the same simply because they&#x27;re working with the military. 
 I don&#x27;t have a clearance but don&#x27;t think I&#x27;d have a problem getting one.

                              <span>Hi everyone
 I lost the last 3 days trying to get a lab of 8 N9Kvs to stay online and as soon as I fired up my old eve-ng v2 it worked fine. I transferred the n9k image from v2 to v5 so it’s the exact same image.
 Any idea why v5 would be so much less stable for me?

 Is there any service provider that offers you the option to have an unlimited data plan, for all around the world?
 Are satellites maybe an option?

                              <span>For context I am mainly a wireless guy (RF design/testing), with some light networking background. I am looking at rolling out a new Meraki 9164 access point deployment. It is my understanding that to use 6 GHZ and 802.1X authentication I am required to use WPA3-Enterprise encryption (Also see Meraki article titled &quot;WPA3 Encryption and Configuration Guide&quot;. With WPA2-Enterprise I was able to use EAP-PEAP MS-Chapv2, but I am getting the feeling that PEAP MS-Chapv2 is not supported on WPA3 Enterprise? Meraki&#x27;s article states:
 To use WPA3 enterprise, the RADIUS servers must use one of the permitted EAP ciphers:
  
TLS_ECDHE_ECDSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
 TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
 TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
  
So I am hoping to find the answer to a few questions:
  
Does WPA3 Enterprise support only EAP-TLS?
 
Is this ubiquitous to all WPA3 enterprise deployments? (standards based requirement)
 If WPA3 Enterprise supports supports other EAP types, what are those? Source would be great!
 As I am not very familiar with EAP-TLS, does that mean I would be required to have Server AND CLIENT certificates?
 
Are there any straightforward guides to learning more about EAP-TLS and how to deploy?
  
Thanks for any insight!

 Would it make sense to create one Network SSID to apply to devices at all locations at once or is that even possible?
 The problem we are having is that we are running out of DHCP leases on our current wireless network and would like to sparse out users/devices so that more IPs will become available.
 Should we have a unique scope/VLAN created for each location separately or would it be possible/more efficient to have the entire wireless network we are creating for all locations being associated with just one scope/VLAN?

                              <span>Hello,
 In my assignment I have to design a network with following components:
  
Firewall (Fortigate) x 2 
  
ISP #1 (Primary) 
 ISP #2 (Secondary/Backup) 
 Backbone Switch x 2 
 Switch Stack (3 switches) 
 Network Printer 
 Server 
 Laptop - using WiFi 
 Access Points - 2 Units 
 
  
Configuration: 
 ● Both of the firewalls should be in cluster (HA) 
 ● Both ISP’s should be in active-passive mode with dependency with the firewall cluster. 
 ● Each device(server, printer, AP, laptop) should have its own VLAN and be isolated from the other devices. 
 ● Backbone &amp; Stack switches should be on the same VLAN as the laptop. 
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 I drew up this diagram: https://ibb.co/fxnWW51
 What is the best practice for this kind of network?
 Where i get confused is - where would you configure routing and interVLAN traffic? On Fortigate or core switches. In my research I&#x27;m getting mixed suggestions - Some say that core switches are for routing, when others say that core switches have to be as fast as possible and have minimal tasks dedicated to them.
 I would appreciate any kind of help, and sorry for stupid questions.

                              <span>I assume this is probably some kind of short or other hardware issue but wondering if anybody else has seen this.
 We have a C9200L-48P-4X which has a single port, which happens to be empty, in an up state with a solid amber light. The switch sees itself as a cdp neighbor on this port, showing the same port ID for both sides:
 usnosw12-113#sh cdp n Device ID Local Intrfce Holdtme Capability Platform Port ID usnosw12-113 Gig 1/0/2 165 S I C9200L-48 Gig 1/0/2 
 There&#x27;s no config on the port. I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s just a repair case but I wanted to ask in case there&#x27;s a chance it&#x27;s something else.

                              <span>Anyone have a problem with eve ng where MySQL logging appears abnormally high? It&#x27;ll chew up 100s of meg&#x27;s of disk space a day and my SSD hard drive is taking a lot of write cycles. Is there a way to turn that down or off?
 EDIT: I have eve-ng pro 5.0.1-20, it&#x27;s recently installed. I think I helped my ssd out a little bit with these fixes:
  
edited these two lines in /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf
  
​
 # max_binlog_size &#x3D; 100M skip-log-bin 
 Since I have no plans on making this a cluster server for eve in the future I just disabled the binlog/logbin feature. This partially helped my problem, I noticed slightly less disk IO, but there was still a lot. It maybe decreased things by 10-25%. But the overall disk usage will not continually climb from the /var/lib/mysql/binlog.xxxxxx files.
 iotop showed this yet: 567481 be/4 mysql 0.00 B/s 551.38 K/s ?unavailable? mysqld [ib_pg_flush_co]
 ib_pg_flush_co was still writing a lot. So I did an strace of that process and it was doing io_submit about once a second. I just happened to google the very last option in the mysqld.cnf file &quot;innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit &#x3D; 2&quot;. A quick google suggests that it forces a write cycle once a second.
  
 edited &quot;innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit &#x3D; 2&quot; from 2 to 1 (the default), and restarted mysql again.
  
EDIT2: This only worked temporarily. After a reboot of the eve-ng box the issue came back. and ib_pg_flush_co is still writing to disk constantly.

                              <span>We have a simple point to point, hub and spoke network. The WAN is dark fiber. I am planning out a migration to have all of our WAN links go through our firewall for east/west visibility. 
 Our current network looks like this: Current Network
 With the new setup I am contemplating the following two options:
 OPTION 1: Option 1
 OPTION 2: Option 2
 Our data center sits in area 0. I am leaning towards setting things up the way it appears in option 2 to limit the OSPF traffic over the WAN. Are there any significant advantages of going option 1 over option 2? 
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 Ive started to read about the MPO/MTP and im slightly confused (somewhat).
 We are planning on connecting two switches together with the QSFP-40G-SR4-S and I have to order the correct leads.
 Since its a transceiver to-transceiver that would make it a type B connection. 
 According to the Cisco webstie it says:
 QSFP-40G-SR4-S
 40GBASE-SR4, 4 lanes, 850 nm MMF
 MPO-12
 Does it mean that when Im placing an order for the correct lead, it should be 8 fibres, Type B Cross polarity and Female to Female or Male to Male? Please help... TIA.

                              <span>Heyo, newer to the Fortinet world. I’ve used a lot of Palo Alto in the past and I guess I adjusted to the way I can view traffic logs on the local device and easily filter through them. 
 Do any of you have experience making a Fortigate local logs more accessible and easily filtered? 
 I’ve messed around in the CLI looking at logs. Changed a few log options. But still only seem to be able to see the last 10 or so logs. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Has anyone successfully configured user or computer authentication using EAP-TLS on NPS? As in, the computer authenticates at the user login screen to allow the user to log in, then when the user profile has loaded it reauthenticates against the user.
 Both computer and user certs are deployed to my test environment. However, only computer authentication is successful. As soon as I sign in to a user profile, it doesn&#x27;t reauthentiate with the user cert.
 Do computer and user authentication require separate EAP-TLS Network Polices or can they share they same one combined? When I&#x27;ve combined them into the same policy with every combination of User, Computer and Windows groups, it didn&#x27;t work.

                              <span>Is anyone able to give me an explanation as to how VLANs can be configured on a layer two switch? 
 I know the theory (mostly) and the commands, but what I&#x27;m struggling with is that I&#x27;ve been told that VLANs should each have their own subnet if best practices are followed which makes sense to me. 
 However as far as I&#x27;m aware you can&#x27;t configure subnets on a layer two switch. It needs to either be a router, or a layer three switch.
 Bearing that in mind how is it possible to have multiple VLANs on a single layer two switch whilst ensuring that each VLAN has its own subnet. It doesn&#x27;t seem possible to me.
 I asked my lecturer but found my questions leading in circles. The lecturer confirmed that you can&#x27;t subnet ports on a layer two switch, but then when I said &quot;So you can&#x27;t have a subnet for each VLAN at the layer two switch then (unless you&#x27;re only using one VLAN for all ports)?&quot; and was told: &quot;Yes you can&quot;. And repeat.

                              <span>Hi Everyone! I´m sorry for my bad English, I from Argentine and don´t speak English.
 I currently work as Sysadmin in Argentine Hospital. I am the first in the IT position in this health company. The basic infrastructure was made by two guys many years ago and today it&#x27;s my turn to &quot;professionalize&quot; the area. Not a minor fact: It is my first job as a SysAdmin and after 6 months I feel ready to start putting everything together seriously.
 The service consists of the following terminals:
  
Forty (40) Personales Computers with Windows 10 (1 Standard user and 1 administrator user for restriction on each PC). 
 Printers and access points (At the moment I am not interested in this point). 
  
I need to implement a:
  
Ticket System (because currently I only use Gmail to manage orders.) Which do you recommend? Where possible free.
 A software for remote access to the terminals. I currently use TeamViewer. I was looking at Radmin, maybe TW will change it to Radmin. What do you think? I like the Radmin interface better and how little intrusive it is.
 
A software to monitor the network. Here I am adrift, any recommendations or advice? The network consists of a Mikrotik Router, a main non-manageable Switch and then an access Switch per floor that distributes to the terminals via UTP Cat5e. 
 
Any other point that they consider necessary to implement...
 A simple network schematic...
 
 What I appreciate most are the advice or experiences. I read in Google and use Udemy to learn right now, I survived out of necessity. But I want to start professionalizing myself and professionalize my modest system.
 Thank you in advance.
 ¡Gracias!

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for an option for re-deploying some Surface Go tablets as wall mounted Spotify kiosks. I&#x27;ve tried the usual UWP kiosk powershell in Windows but Spotify is strange in that it appears it is now an plug-in for the xbox game bar UWP app. It can&#x27;t be found in the GUI to set up a kiosk app, and if you try to run SpotifyAB.SpotifyMusic_zpdnekdrzrea0!Spotify it just gets stuck in a loop until I remote powershell in and remove the kiosk setting. If you use SpotifyAB.SpotifyMusic_zpdnekdrzrea0!Widget it displays &quot;We weren&#x27;t able to start your app.&quot; and an error code which indicates an operation was not supported.
 I&#x27;ve considered Edge fullscreen but the web-based can only cast to Spotify Connect devices they&#x27;ve previously registered and as this is at a school, giving access to an unauthenticated web browser is something I&#x27;d rather avoid.
 Another potential is BlissOS (Androidx86) but then I need to put in time to get that working with an MDM if it is even possible.
 If I can get it working, I&#x27;ll design a secure-ish wall mount and 3D print as many as needed. (we have 30 of them) I was also considering using them for control panels for certain building automations (is there a more commercial focused option like homeassistant?) and also for using with Xibo for digital signage.
 Background: I&#x27;m the solo IT person for a special school, always looking for cheaper ways of doing things which make these kids&#x27; lives a bit better. The more I can save, the more I can spend on IT based programs which help their learning. If I had loads of money, I&#x27;d just buy iPads for this. Reason we have Surface Go is we&#x27;re a 100% windows school, no apple, no Google Apps Suite Workspace.

 For me I seem to always think of work. Ex. When is the best time to execute this change, Do I have an update for my weekly project meeting tomorrow, Did I forget a user who walked up to me and asked for help..

 I looked in the local registry to verify that the setting is configured and it is.
 Cached domain logon information - Windows Server | Microsoft Learn 
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\ 
  
Value name: CachedLogonsCount
  
Values of 0-50 are valid and it is set as &quot;2&quot; and the laptop has been restarted, but only one logon is being cached. If &quot;run as&quot; is used with a second account, the original user is no longer able to logon offline. 
 Is there anything else than needs to be done to make this work?
 Is there any method to view which user account or accounts logons are currently cached on a device?

 But this seems like the easiest thing to setup. And we have less than 50 people at the company for now. Should I be considering not forcing all traffic through the vpn(when they have it on)? And if so... how? Right now our endpoints are public and we use ip whitelisting. So forcing all traffic through the vpn means I just have to whitelist the VPN. Doing selective traffic I assume means I have to somehow tell the client what to send to the VPN and what not to...

We don’t have a ton of servers that are doing a whole lot. Most of time time is spent on our network. I took over a role that has not been too well defined. My boss pretty much hired me not knowing my technical skills, and thought that if I didn’t do well technically than I could at least be the IT project manager. 
 I’m the only Sys admin, and there are two help desk guys who don’t know really anything about servers or networking. I take some escalations, but not many.

                              <span>I had a hilarious scenario at a school I provide IT support for.. Its one of those things that happen in IT where if I were to tell someone they would instantly think it was bs. And in the moment you don&#x27;t quite believe whats happening yourself.
 So, this school they have a 40mbps VDSL line. As you can imagine with over 200 devices on the network at times this is pretty slow. Today the download speed was 0.4 mbps with a 800ms ping. How they survive on this I will never know. I&#x27;m constantly trying to get them to upgrade to fibre but they just do not have the budget to do that. There network equipment is a mess too, they have a Dell Sonicwall router about 12 year old and Cisco switches from about 10 years ago. They recently upgraded a couple of switches to unifi and how have unifi ac pro access points.
 ​
 Today I was going round seeing if anyone had any issues in their classrooms and a staff member approached me asking why they had been asked to turn off ALL devices in their class. I walked around and everybody was turning all their devices off, it felt like apocalypse scene in a movie. The person who told them to turn everything off I went and asked her why this had happened and her response was &quot;I needed to download a large file and the internet is too slow&quot;. I couldn&#x27;t stop laughing. I had never heard of anything so outrageous in my life. The funny thing was, 75% devices dropped off the network and the speed was 2mbps download. 
 ​
 Its so hard working with schools to improve their tech when they quite literally don&#x27;t have the budget to upgrade stuff. They upgraded their servers a couple years ago but that was because they literally failed constantly.
 ​
 Thought this story was too funny not to share.

                              <span>Solved! TLS 1.2 was not working as we wanted it to after 22H2. 
  
Open Registry Editor
 Navigate to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\RasMan\PPP\EAP\13
 Create DWORD key TlsVersion value FC0
 Gpupdate /force
 reboot
  
Done

 Weird problem.
 We have a couple users who snuck in and updated their machines to Windows 11 before we locked that down. We also have a group policy that we designed for Windows 10 that deploys the info for all the SSIDs across all offices to all computers. It is set to reach out to RADIUS to verify ID, so users never have to log in.
 This GPO works great on all Windows 10 machines, and according to our other SysAdmin, it worked fine for 11 until 22H2 dropped. Now, users see the network that was pushed by GPO, but it tells them they &quot;Can&#x27;t connect to this network&quot;.
 I can log in to one of the Win11 machines and manually tell it to get on the &quot;Hidden Network&quot; and give it all the info, and that manually configured one works fine.
 If I check the GPO on the Win11 machine, Computer Configuration&gt;Windows Settings&gt;Security Settings&gt;Wireless Network (IEEE 802.11) Policies and open the policy we created, then open the properties of the network, then go to the Security tab. I verify that it is using Secured Password (EAP-MSCHAP v2) as the Authentication Method and click Configure, but the EAP MSCHAPv2 properties window that pops up has the &quot;When connecting: Automatically use my Windows logon name and password (and domain if any) box unchecked and is greyed out. On the Win10 machines, though, that is checked.
 Given that, I&#x27;m assuming that the reason they can&#x27;t connect is due to the Windows logon name and password not being pushed. Just not sure why the GPO isn&#x27;t configuring that correctly in Windows 11.
 Any thoughts?

                              <span>I work for a CPA firm and my boss was getting evaluations done. It&#x27;s just me and one colleague is the entire IT department.
 He was stating there was some complaints so my colleague and I suggested a ticket system so that we can make sure everyone is taken care of in terms of priority. 
 He exclaimed &quot;No no no, we don&#x27;t need a ticket system, this is our ticket system!&quot; And held up a pack of stickey notes and waved them at the camera during our webex meeting. I had to turn off my audio because I was laughing so hard.
 Just thought you&#x27;d all find this as funny and embarrassing as we did.
 LOL

                              <span>I work help desk and had someone put in a ticket annoyed that Cisco WebEx was a startup program. He said he never used it, so I went ahead and disabled it as a startup program and uninstalled it. 
 ​
 He emails me back saying it still starts at log in. So, I used sysinternals to disable it. I continued to leave what was left installed and disabled as I didn&#x27;t want to make a small complaint turn into a potential mess. 
 ​
 A program should not require sysinternals to disable a program at startup. A program should not persist after uninstalling it.

 Maybe I&#x27;m late but, it&#x27;s seems there is a propagation of Nevada ransomware today on WAN Esxi 6.x , exploiting this CVe : https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2022-0030.html
 I have no such HV but maybe it can prevent an outage for you :)

                              <span>For context; I&#x27;m a 21 year old IT Tech, been here for just over 2 years now. 
 Small-Medium sized org, internal IT. Small department. 
 I set a project to get an internal CA set up for an internal web cert. 
 After 3 days of connection reset issues, amongst others... (SAN!!!) - it&#x27;s working! I did have to disable TLS 1.3 though as it was causing the connection reset errors. Looks like the handshake was being rejected. 
 Feeling proud as I&#x27;ve done this all on my own. 
 However, I did only set up a root CA (I know a subordinate is really meant to be set up) but we&#x27;re tight on Server licenses and it&#x27;s for two informational reporting internal sites accessed by a couple of departments.

                              <span>Hey Everyone,
 Our org currently uses AnyConnect VPN for remote access. We have it configured for the Windows pre-logon as well, and we instruct people to sign into the VPN at the login screen of the computer. Our reasoning was because things like GPOs and logon scripts seemed to &quot;work best&quot; or even possibly only work if the user signed into the computer while being &quot;on network&quot;(with the VPN active).
 I have the ability to switch our AnyConnect VPN setup to have our firewall point directly to Azure for MFA purposes, but that config does not support the ability to sign into the VPN at the login screen of the computer. Wouldn&#x27;t that be a problem again for logon GPOs and logon scripts?
 What do other orgs do to solve for this that have users sign into a VPN AFTER signing into their computer instead of before?

                              <span>Hey folks,
 Recently i&#x27;ve been hired as a server administrator for an IT company in my area. I got the job because my education background is in software development and they want to train me as a server admin + use my programming skills for powershell scripting &amp; automation.
 The onboard training is totally fine, I&#x27;m comfortable in the M365 admin portal and AD seems straight forward enough, but where I have no actual training (outside of a brief course I took semester one) I was wondering if there are any recommended online courses? Through Udemy or somewhere else. When I was learning programming the Odin Project helped a lot with my understanding of the webdev side of things so I was hoping there&#x27;s something similar for sys admin.
 ​
 Any help is appreciated, otherwise I&#x27;ll just pick the highest rated course on Udemy lol.
 Thanks

                              <span>I’m assuming they have a premium support option. All of these places do. Is premium any better than regular, because they are baaaad?

                              <span>The idiots in AP received a Spoofed email from one of our vendors. They sent new wire transfer information and then sent $40k to them. 
 Looks like i am finally getting EDI (electronic data Interchange) now. It takes stupidity to make things happen.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been at the same company for nearly 15 years, late 30&#x27;s. My salary is at $110k which for here in Ohio has offered a good life. I&#x27;ve been debating back and forth about applying for other jobs to at least test the market to see what I&#x27;m worth. I&#x27;m a Senior Monitoring Engineer and work with tools such as App Dynamics, Splunk, DataDog, etc. My wife and I have a baby on the way (our first and only) so I&#x27;ve been pondering if I should explorer other options to increase my salary.
 However, things are going very well where I work which is a good thing. The company I work at has been very stable, work life balance is excellent with typically no more then 40 hours per week, remote 4 days per week, have 6 weeks of vacation, and the other benefits (7% 401k matching, health care is under $200 a month for a family, bonus is usually around $7k) are good as well. I&#x27;ve seen some other job listings in my field would offer a good bump in pay but I&#x27;m hesitant to even leave. I start thinking &quot;Is now the right time to really leave with the way the economy is&quot;, and &quot;my wife and I having a baby on the way, stay where it&#x27;s been stable&quot;. On the other hand I also think &quot;I&#x27;ve been here nearly 15 years, let&#x27;s see what&#x27;s out there and what I&#x27;m worth&quot;. Maybe there&#x27;s no harm in at least applying for some of these positions.
 What would you do? How much is stability, work life balance and remote work worth to you?

                              <span>I didn&#x27;t expect to get stumped by this, but I can&#x27;t seem to find a way to stop it from happening. When you use remote desktop, Windows automatically stores a default.rdp file in the user level documents folder. If you have OneDrive backup on, that means it syncs between your devices, which may have different resolutions and thus be very annoying. Does anyone know of a way to change the default storage location or stop an individual file from syncing?

                              <span>So I will start with saying I understand there are enterprise text solutions, but we already have cell phone numbers we are in contract for both phones and hosted voip..... That being the disclaimer..... the sales managers have said text your customers, the sales team did with great success and close deals.... Now they need to get away for a day or week for vacation or for health reasons..... We can&#x27;t take care of the customer because they leave their cell phone at home. (I would too if I was on vacation)....
 So I am trying to get inside sales access to all their imessages for a small period of time. 
 I tried Verizon message plus, but deleting all history with a customer of a few years is a hard push back and you lose historical and disable imessage all together... Clunky. 
 I have found that if I take an iPhone with no service and hook it up to the wireless, sign into their icloud on the phone I can text! But I still have to deliver a spare iPhone to someone to cover..... I have thought about a virtual macos that people can remote into.... But before I reinvent the wheel again... Is there something easier? Anyone in my boat? Thanks redit kingdom

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a little data center that&#x27;s growing and now have a little over 70 windows server VM&#x27;s. Little tasks like do X, then repeat 70+ times are good for security but there must be a better way. Unfortunately we are on windows so all the linux thing&#x27;s I&#x27;m thinking of aren&#x27;t going to work.
 X could be any combination of these; 
  
start/stop service
 place a provided file in a location (not shared folder)
 read &amp; report contents of a text file
 run a executable
 pretty much anything you can do CLI
  
For example at the moment I find myself updating OpenVPN. Place the provided msi in Downloads, stop the service, run the installer, check for installer errors, start service, after 1 minute delay open the OpenVPN log and review for errors. The error review in this case requires a human but if it simply dumped the log file somewhere I can get to it on a orchestration machine, renamed it with what server it came from that would be perfect. 
 I&#x27;m searching and finding a LOT of posts about automating windows updates, but I think we finally have WSUS under control.

                              <span>We are in the process of testing Intune auto pilot deployments on windows 10 machines. Trying to nail the OOBE before we go live but lots of resets on the machines and installing windows means that a test can take over an hour.
 Am I not thinking of something that can speed this process up? What has anyone else had success with?

                              <span>Anyone notice a severe uptick in spam emails?
 My users are getting spam from emails that look like they are coming from our domain. In 2022 it was like once a month we&#x27;d get an email, but now it&#x27;s multiple times a day...
 The emails are coming from all over the world ( I used the exchange message trace to find the source IP) and blocking the addresses don&#x27;t seem to help...
 I&#x27;m going to make a rule to block any messages with a html file. I&#x27;ve never seen a legitimate email with an html file outside of making websites in school.
 How does your company deal with increased spam traffic?

                              <span>This is my situation. I had created a user&#x27;s shared mailbox and I disabled the user because he quit his job. Everything was fine the mailbox was working and had all the emails. Then a month later I got the same person&#x27;s job, so I created an AD user with the same name, assigned groups and etc. And what happened was that AD got synchronized with Azure and that mail also got synchronized and left empty. So do you know if there is a way to restore that mail somehow?

 I&#x27;ve already created a guide for the actual process of setting up Win 11 on their new laptops, but I still wanted to create a little fact sheet of changes between Windows 10 and 11. This is for an insurance company, so the changes should be focused more on GUI changes rather than changes to things like performance or new widgets(for the most part, if the software isn&#x27;t in our Company Portal, we don&#x27;t want them installing it anyway). 
 I personally haven&#x27;t used Win 11 that much(the project kind of got sprung on me short notice) so simply writing the differences I&#x27;ve noticed might not be too helpful and most articles I&#x27;ve read only give a nod towards look and feel changes then focus on things like gaming performance. 
 I don&#x27;t mind doing the actual reading myself, so links will be enough, but if anyone has brief summaries of changes, that would also help immensely. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hey all !
 I might need your insight here ! As we are moving out of sccm to WS1, our security department is quite demanding regarding our packaging standards.
 Basically, in our packages we might have &quot;sensitive information&quot; ( licence server , accounts , database ...) Plainly visible in scripts ( most of time we are using PSADT ) and they want us to encrypt / hide as much as possible these data. 
 File Encryption seems quite difficult to setup for such purposes (due to find a way to make the package usable through WS1, and decrypt it on devices !) , Hide through full encapsulation in .MST / MSI might cause tons of rework and aditiional loads... Any idea on your side ? Thanks !

 I want to ensure that everytime someone enters a specific application they get prompted for MFA. 
 Is it possible? I only found way to get triggered with a 1 hour cooldown at the very least.

                              <span>So we&#x27;ve got a bit of an annoying issue with some Windows 11 field devices. They use some in-built 4g connectivity when out and about.
 The issue is that when in patchy signal, the AOVPN tries a few times to connect and then stops trying to auto-connect.
 This appears to happen only for Windows 11 devices. There doesn&#x27;t appear to be a GPO option to force the auto-connect functionality back on.
 Another issue is that we can&#x27;t disable the option to untick &#x27;Connect Automatically&#x27;, so the user can untick it and the VPN won&#x27;t automatically connect. Is there any GPO or setting that I&#x27;m missing which will help? 
 I&#x27;m aware that this is a &#x27;minor&#x27; inconvenience which could be solved with User Training but management have insisted that these field engineers are dumb as bricks and will just complain so it&#x27;s easier to just get the VPN to try all the time constantly.
 I&#x27;m looking into a scheduled task fired on Network Connection successful but wanted a second opinion. Any ideas?

                              <span>So, my networking is quite rusty and not sure if this is possible. Instead of going onto every one of our servers and going to whatsmyip.org. Is there a way to do a scan to find this out? I was thinking nmap but didn&#x27;t think this would give the public IP if scanned locally.

 the users have an exchange mailbox and different pop3/smtp mailboxes. as inbox folder they take the exchange inbox (all data in the same place). now they cant send emails through smtp &quot;no permission to send as...&quot;.
 outlook should not even check that, because it should be send over smtp. does someone came up with the same problem and found a solution?

                              <span>Hey all, I have recently been looking around the net to find the easiest method of being able to export a list of sign in blocked (disabled users) that still have specific licenses assigned within 365, for example visio, E5 or project licenses etc.
 I’m sure this is something others have come across but I’m finding it difficult to find a efficient way to do this, whilst also being able to export the results to csv or other easily readable format. 
 How do you guys manage this in your environments to ensure you free up these types of licenses?

 I&#x27;m the solo SysAdmin for a company of around 40. Our shipping, marketing and shop management branch moved out of a larger city, because we need space - a lot of it. Keeping inventory is expensive. Anyway, on to the story...
 Summer 2019
 My phone rings. It&#x27;s my boss. They&#x27;ve got &quot;exciting news to share&quot; and call me into a meeting later that day. In the meeting, the announcement is made to the other higher-ups and everyone who&#x27;s on the organizational crew: &quot;We&#x27;re moving. Here&#x27;s the new address. It&#x27;s a nice place, and...&quot; so my first question was: Why do I only get wind of…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a scenario that I need to get some clarity on as I cannot find any real answers online.
 We have Macbooks that are on Apple Business Manager and the company also wants to enrol them into Intune to deploy policies and profiles etc in line with company security policies. However, they would also like the Macbooks to be able to sign in with AAD credentials rather than AD credentials. Is it possible to link ABM with both Intune and AAD, rather than Intune and then configuration profiles to setup directory utility for AD?
 I see articles around setting up a Federation between ABM and AAD: Intro to federated authentication with Apple Business Manager – Apple Support (UK) but then is this the same as this: Tutorial: Configure Apple Business Manager for automatic user provisioning with Azure Active Directory - Microsoft Entra | Microsoft Learn 
 With the above, can we then still utilise automatic enrolment into Intune with ABM like this: Enroll macOS devices - Apple Business Manager or Apple School Manager | Microsoft Learn

                              <span>So.
 I am in the midst of switching over our backup offering to Veeam.
 As part of this we want to use S3 object storage for immutable offsite storage.
 The most commonly mentioned companies are Wasabi and Backblaze.
 Wasabi does not support european cards with 3-d secure as shown y a previous post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/zxj4l0/s3compatible_provider_wasabi_does_not_support/ 
 Someone else recommended Backblaze B2 but I reached out to their support and they said that they dont support these types of cards either.
 Any europeans here who can set me on the right track?

 We are making some changes to our environment in regards to allowing AAD groups to be synced on prem, basically so certain groups are mirrored across the board.
 However once we enabled group write back against a set of groups we started getting the following error.

 The sync rules in scope have a mix of Persistent and ExecuteOnce attribute flows for the same destination attribute: msExchMailboxGuid

 Not exactly sure what this is? I assume its to do with us pointing on prem AD to look at mailboxes in Azure? we had no choice to do this as our move to Azure was in an emergency response.
 ​
 Any suggestions, currently we are just wanting to get the basic sync between on-prem and AAD working until we can figure out the rest, but we get this error on most if not all users.
 ​
 Thanks!!

 I&#x27;m testing Winget with intune in our testing environment, quite a useful tool to keep software updated! In our production environment, though, we have a particular network which is HW firewalled except for some web addresses, so in that context Winget is not able to communicate externally. At the moment it seems to me there&#x27;s no proxy support in Winget, so I was wondering if there&#x27;s a simple solution on how to allow winget to operate also on that limited network.

 We are currently in the process of setting up our Apple Business Manager to automaticly create Apple ID&#x27;s for all our users, and the link to our Azure AD has been set up. 
 All of our employees are currently using Iphone 12&#x27;s which are company phones. However, a lot of our employees have used their company email to create an Apple ID. 
 What will exactly happen to these Apple ID&#x27;s?
 Since the Apple ID&#x27;s that they are currently using are all created with their company emails. Will the only real change be that the accounts are changed from a personal ID to a company ID?

 I&#x27;m currently in need of session logs with timestamp and additional metadata from a bash session Input and Output of commands run in bash terminal but currently i found that tmux logging logs only a screen of the pane and can&#x27;t be manipulated very efficiently
 Any idea on how to customize the logs
 in the end i need to have a json file with the input, output, path, user and some other data
 thank you !

                              <span>Hello fellow sysadmins, I need to run a sanity check hope you can shed some light.
 I&#x27;ve inherited an environment, I&#x27;m still discovering and learning about it. It&#x27;s an on-prem bare-metal/VMware, public cloud is minimal and completely independant. One concern that I have is that I&#x27;m seen some odd DHCP reservations for productions servers.
 To give an idea, I&#x27;ve seen DHCP reservation for MS-SQL database server, Domain controllers (all of them), Application Servers, anything that seems to be a production server where many people connect to, it is likely to have a reservation.
 Then in some cases, not all of them, the server has a static IP address assigned, despite of having a reservation. And you probably guess it, the IP address statically assigned to that server is in the DHCP range where other Desktop computers are also connected. This causes that the DHCP report the reservation as inactive.
 From the other side of the fence the monitoring system which is simple doing ICMP every once in awhile detects that host is down. There are no connectivity problems in some occasions when I manually check.
 In some other instances the ESXi web UI is inaccessible, I&#x27;ve experienced myself a duplicate IP caused by one of my computers that took the exact reserved IP address which belongs to that ESXi.
 My question is simple. Is this a normal practice to heavily rely on DHCP reservations to manage mission critical servers IP addressing? My personal bias to decimate that configuration. Go back to traditional static IP addressing, pushing the DHCP range to leave room for server addressing.
 On what scenarios a DHCP reservation would make sense to keep when dealing with servers that run network services that should be available to employees.

                              <span>Hi, I am planning a server build which will run Ubuntu. I plan to store all my data on there (as well as additional services). But it&#x27;s the data bit that I&#x27;m trying to work out at the moment. I will also have 2 other backups of my data, one on an external drive and one in the cloud. But I was wondering if I can update my OS without moving any data.
 I want to create a bootable partition in RAID 1 across x2 NVMe or SSD drives for the OS and have all my data on x4 High Capacity 7200RPM drives in a RAID 10 btrfs partition. That way, in theory, I can install a new OS, log in and have all my data still there on the other partition. Is this right/possible?

 Do you know how much of a pain in the A it is to generate a CSR and Key with MMC. Just annoying.
 Open SSL is like one straight command with a bunch of options.
 Yes you can install it and so on and so forth, but it should be standard now. I mean they did implement the Linux kernel or something like that right.

                              <span>Hi all, hoping to get some pointers on a planned SharePoint migration. Mainly around Teams setup as each site will likely be Teams enabled.
 I understand there are varying degrees of complexity depending on depth of Teams integration but have narrowed it down to 3 options.
  
Setup each department with their own site and dump folders alongside General. No private channels at this stage but, if setup down the line, there&#x27;ll be nothing in General for users who are added (I understand the new Shared Channel option fixes this but seems fine to just keep everything alongside General anyway. Users can&#x27;t delete the General folder but can delete the contents).
 Setup one site and create Private channels for the various departments. Easier to manage from a permissions standpoint as we can delegate channel owners to add and remove members. Downside is limit on number of private channels per team (will probably be under that though). I can map private channels to File Explorer but the name doubles-up (can fix this by customising the desktop.ini file).
 Let SharePoint migration tool dump everything to one site and call it a day. Deal with permission changes as needed.
  
Also keen on references to other guides or scripts for checking file conflicts outside of the SharePoint migration tool. Been trying to research best practices for a while but the info keeps changing since the platform keeps evolving. Also saw a guide about using metadata rather than folders so they&#x27;re accessible from more than one location but that seems like even more work/complexity.
 TIA

                              <span>I have a particular client who are of Chinese background and still do a lot of business with China, so they have been using WeChat to communicate with external users. I don&#x27;t like it, but it is what it is.
 What I have done in this case is install the WeChat UWP app from the Microsoft Store to at least limit it&#x27;s access because UWP Microsoft Store apps are supposed to be Sandboxed.
 What has now happened is that the UWP app has been pulled from the Microsoft Store and the only one in there now is one which requires &quot;Uses all system resources&quot; and then prompts for Admin rights upon install just for good measure.
 I tried to outsmart them by using the wechat web app https://web.wechat.com/ and this worked for a while too. But now what happens is that when the user scans the code it then takes them a page which says that they need to install the Desktop app instead.
 This has been a blessing because now I have the justification to completely remove it from the computer and have it stay on their personal phones, under the threat of hijacking the entire computer.
 I just wanted to give others the heads up of what&#x27;s going on.
 And also, to call out Microsoft for even allowing such malicious activity to occur in the Windows Store, when the original intent was to have every app Sandboxed except by special permission of having the app verified by them, which obviously they have not done by allowing an app like this to have full permissions and request admin rights to the whole system.

                              <span>I&#x27;ll do my best to provide all the details I can but ask away..
 I have an R740 Dell PowerEdge server with dual port 10GB Broadcom NetExtreme SFP+ Ethernet network daughter card where I&#x27;ve plugged in a SFP+ single mode fiber 10GB LR transceiver, brand name 10gtek part# ‎AXS13-192-10-Cisco2. I have connected a single mode fiber optic cable there and the other end on a quantum scalar library tape drive 8GB fibre channel connection(no transceiver needed there) but i see no link light status on R740&#x27;s NIC. I performed a loopback test on the dual R740 SFP+ ports by connecting them to each other with same type transceivers of course and got green link lights. I&#x27;m not sure what to make of all this or where the incompatibility lies between all new equipment and accessories. The OS is Windows Svr 2019 and has all and the latest drivers. I&#x27;m certain the system doesn&#x27;t have a fiber channel HBA as it utilizing the NDC card described. One of the SFP+ NIC port on the same card has an cat 7 ethernet cable connected also by transceiver and has no issues, status lights are green. I&#x27;ve tried swapping the ports I&#x27;m connecting the fiber but no luck. I&#x27;m very new with this type of networking and hoping someone more experienced can point out the obvious. Dell support says their hardware has no issues based on logs.
 I see someone here with a similar issue but their solution hasn&#x27;t worked for me. https://www.dell.com/community/PowerEdge-Hardware-General/R740-Fiber-Module-issue/td-p/6089505

                              <span>We are currently using R730s and we’re pretty satisfied with its performance. However, we would like to refresh our APs to the most recent product offerings from Ruckus. I’m considering the R850 or the R760. Would you recommend the R760 over the R850 just because of WiFi 6E? What would be the advantages of one over the other?

                              <span>Just thought I&#x27;d quickly reach out here for ideas while I&#x27;m waiting on vendors to get back to me on options, but we&#x27;re looking for a replacement for the Juniper SRX router due to lead times being quite extended and the cost having increased.
 We use them as a primary router that we sell as part of our WAN service offering, and the only real requirements we have are that it needs to support up to a 1gbps connection, support LTE and vDSL.
 We&#x27;ve been eyeing off the Cisco 900 series, but we&#x27;re open to other options as we&#x27;re quite flexible with what we go with.
 Does anyone have any suggestions on other models we could go with?

 Is there any other ways that work well and are worth the headache? (years and years ago I remember it being a headache to setup virtual labs)

                              <span>Hey All -
 I&#x27;ve been in the field for ~15 years now going through customers, VAR, and vendor life. I&#x27;m very well compensated and generally don&#x27;t hate work.
 However, I&#x27;m very close to becoming Financially Independent (FI) /r/financialindependence/. I don&#x27;t really feel like stopping work, but I&#x27;d sure love to not work full time. For someone who is CCIE level of skill what type of part-time opportunities might there be?
 I&#x27;m open to true PT or maybe working FT 6 months a year, maybe doing a contract part of the year then not working the other half. I was debating trying to reach out to some recruiters in my network to see if they get those types of opportunities&#x27;. I also considered teaching, but honestly it doesn&#x27;t excite me a ton.
 Whatever I do I&#x27;d like to be able to take large chunks of time off to travel (2-3 months a year) and some decent PTO otherwise to enjoy time with my family.
 What options might you suggest?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to setup LLDP on my Cisco 9300 switches to allow my Poly phones to determine their location for E911 on Zoom. I have only used CDP, and with the voice vlan, the phones figure out what vlan they need to be, and life&#x27;s great. But, when I try to dial 933 to verify the more granular E911 location, it can&#x27;t seem to sort out the MAC address of the switch it&#x27;s connected to so it can be more precise.
 So far, I ran lldp run on the switch, and it seems to now be on. If I run show lldp neighbors, I get all the phones, APs, and other junk on the switch. But, the phone still doesn&#x27;t seem to know what&#x27;s going on. Running LDWin on a client machine to read the LLDP packets doesn&#x27;t yield any results either. Either I&#x27;m getting erroneous results, or LLDP isn&#x27;t configured correctly.
 Looking at the Cisco documentation, it looks like I may need to run lldp transmit and lldp receive on the specific interfaces, but that hasn&#x27;t gotten me anywhere either. Oddly enough, the commands do not error out, but if I show the running config for the interface, those commands don&#x27;t show up in the config. At the bottom of the post is the current interface config.
 I&#x27;m certain I&#x27;m missing something simple and obvious, but this is kicking my butt.
 Port config:

                              <span>Just asking because I’m amazed of the numbers of MSPs/Integrators who ask TAC to support them in a remote session during a device upgrade or because they need to finish the configuration of a device in live network (LAN specifically). For me it’s completely not their role. So is it common for constructors’ TAC (Cisco, HP, Aruba, Palo Alto, Extreme, etc…) to fulfill that role ?

                              <span>Hey all,
 Have a pretty simple network, Cisco, PA.
 Just want config backups and to automate it on schedule. Fairly simple nothing overly complicated. Has Unimus been good for you? Before I pitch this to the man, any glaring issues I should know about?
 I tried Rancid, and Its just not going to be the best solution as my backup guy knows nada about Linux. I ran a test with Unimus and it was just TOO easy for the price.

 Thank you!

 I‘ve recently started a new role and looking to lock a few things down. I’m just looking at an ACL for locking down vty access. 
 Are there any best practices for denying SSH from PC vlans? We have roughly 30 switches … previous places we have had an ACL on each individual switch. But have been playing with applying an ACL at the SVI on the L3 instead. 
 Couldn‘t find Much on guidelines or whether its personal preference.

                              <span>I am looking for someone who has access to a stock Nexcom NSA 5130 appliance and would be willing to provide me a dump of its BIOS. It‘s a fairly standard x86 type device with an AMI Aptio 4 BIOS that can be dumped with AMI‘s regular tools. I would be able to provide a FreeDOS image with the necessary tool included, so it would be a matter of writing this to a USB thumbdrive, booting it and running a single command.
 Background is that I obtained a Barracuda F400 firewall appliance that is based on the Nexcom but has a custom BIOS, lacking some features, most importantly the acoustic management part.

                              <span>First, I inherited this nightmare, it isn’t my creation. I’m just tasked with making this whole thing work and so far I’m at an almost complete loss on the best way to segment this mess. It’s a fairly large subnet class c /21 with everything (and I do mean everything) on a single network. One of the biggest hurdles that I’ve had is diagnosing where the current loops are due to the Unifi system meshing (if meshing is turned off, nothing works which tells me it wasn’t designed correctly to begin with). So I’m trying to come up with a new design that will use what I’ve been given (they went building to building instead of each building back to the core due to the costs for horizontal boring). I’ve got two actual routers (Cisco) and some newer Catalyst 9200’s which are capable of full L3 routing (full meaning they can use an actual routing protocol and not just static). 
 My first thought is to segment out each building with it’s own network and VLAN but I am at a loss on making it so everything can still get to everything (this is a live production/manufacturing facility so they cannot go down).The only way to really isolate the loops that remain (this network grew at rapid speed over about 20 years - things just kept being added on and not properly tracked) is to attempt to use the Catalyst devices as “border routers”. I’ve been working in this field for over 20 years and I can honestly say, this is the first network that hasn’t been a standard full mesh or hub and spoke design. So I’m reaching out to the wise folks on here to see if I’m going about this the right way or if perhaps someone out there has experience with such a thing and can give me some pointers. I’ve been removing every hub/non managed switch I can find as I come across them because they seem to quite literally be everywhere lol along with documenting how everything actually connects for future reference.

 Vlan v21: 10.21.x.x
 Two Windows 2012 DHCP servers, 192.168.x.13 and 192.168.x.6, are using a load balancer with the scopes Default, v69, and v21. IP helper is used by v69 and v21. (DHCP relays). I&#x27;m using Sonicwall with layer 3 unifi switches. Sonicwall is the IP helper and default gateway.
 If I assign a port to vlan69 only, the pc will dhcp 10.31.10.x. 
 I assign it vlan69 and tag it vlan21, the pc will dhcp 192.168.0.x and the phone will dhcp 10.21.10.x. 
 If I assign it vlan69 and tag it vlan21 and DEFAULT, the pc will dhcp 192.168.0.x and the phone will dhcp 10.21.10.x. 
 It&#x27;s like when vlan21 is involved, vlan69 gets overlooked?

 Our current setup from top to bottom looks like this:
  
Spectrum EU2251 Modem with 600 mbps service and static IP &gt;&gt;
 Sagecom 5280 router doing the management, including a dozen or so reserved IPs, but not using the wifi portion of the router &gt;&gt;
 An older Netgear ProSafe 24 Port Gigabit Switch (unmanaged) which handles all ethernet connections, including &gt;&gt; 
 Synology NAS with VPN setup for occasional remote connections (pretty damn happy with this).
 Another unmanaged switch further down the line that was necessary to prevent me pulling additional ethernet cables quite a bit a way, that then serves:

Finally, I realized that the appliance was configured with 172.24.38.130/25. My server was configured at 172.24.38.50/24. I chose .50 because I could see in the appliance&#x27;s configuration settings that this IP was what the appliance was configured to talk to (this obviously doesn&#x27;t specify netmask, just an IP I was specifically searching for in the config). 
 Of course, I fucked up by making assumptions and not documenting configuration settings from the outset and that&#x27;s the reason I spent days troubleshooting this. I&#x27;m just trying to understand why this would be a preferred choice? I can understand wanting these two IPs (the appli…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m doing a lab for a proof of concept using MPLS. I can get it running without issue if I plug the CE equipment into a gig port on the routers and do an xconnect from end to end. In the lab, not an issue, it just works. CE equipment on each end see each other as neighbors and L2 is good to go.
 What they want is instead have the customer plug into a switchport and then have the MPLS run on a router SVI from end to end, Router on a Stick style. They want it to be L2, so the CE equipment just sees us as a LAN. And they don&#x27;t want to monkey with the client&#x27;s VLAN tags...what goes in tagged on one side comes out tagged on the other. I can&#x27;t get this to work in the lab.
 I&#x27;ve tried having the switchport as a trunk and just allow the VLAN associated with the SVI on the router. I&#x27;ve tried it as an all-in trunk. I&#x27;ve tried it as an access port. The CE equipment doesn&#x27;t see each other.
 Am I missing something, or is this not possible? All of our gear is old and not getting any newer...the routers I&#x27;m using are 3800&#x27;s, the switches aren&#x27;t L3. Here&#x27;s the port configs I&#x27;m using....

                              <span>HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is the backbone of the internet and the foundation of all communication between web browsers and servers. Understanding the basics of HTTP and how it works is essential for anyone working in web development, system administration, or IT in general.
 HTTP is a client-server protocol, meaning that a client (such as a web browser) makes a request to a server, and the server responds with the requested data. HTTP requests and responses are simple text messages, sent over the internet using the TCP/IP protocol.

                              <span>I&#x27;m very new to this automation thing and i&#x27;m trying to figure it out how to respond yes to the following scenario:
 1 - interface loo500
 2 - clear configuration this
 3 - yes
 ​
 I&#x27;m using netmiko for the time being while i try to learn more about ansible playbook. I need to figure this out because i&#x27;m going to use this tools to implement several BGP peers accros multiple devices, and to apply the route-policy into the IPv6 peer i need to respond with yes. Does someone know how to handle this?
 ​
 I tried to use the netmiko prompt but it only allows me to insert one command (i need to be inside the interface). I also tried to but one service to enter the interface and use workflow to clear the configuration on the next command, but when it runs it is made a new connection with de device (my thought was that in the workflow, when a service ends and a new one begins, the new one would take place where the first one ended).

                              <span>Hey,
 We are experimenting a little bit with PLC splitters and we have issues using our fibre splitter we use on a daily basis.
 We are trying to splice together a PLC cable with some LC pigtails.
 Splicing together two LC pigtails work without any issue. But the plc splitter side is simply giving an error on our splicer.
 We are using a fujikura fibre splicer.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 does anyone use Unimus for daily reports, or is it even possible? 
 My idea is to every night push config for basic stuff, version, serial, hostname, IP address, etc.
 That is not a problem, but I don&#x27;t know how to extract that output to PDF, CSV or some other format. 
 Only thing that I found was in notification options that send me when mass push config is done, and on what devices was successful and on what wasn&#x27;t.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m having some intermittend network issues with a client that doesn&#x27;t show anything related in network device logs, so probably client related.
 In the past I troubleshooted those issues with a kinda throwing star looking physical tap device and a laptop. But is there a hardware PCAP device that someone could recommend that is easily attaced to a port mirror on a switch that captures all the traffic, saves it as a PCAP for troubleshooting using Wireshark and possibly even have a web interface of some sort to download the PCAP files from?
 I&#x27;m unable to find a good tool online.
 That would really makes this process a lot easier because we&#x27;d be able to ship this thing to a client preconfigured and they just need to hook it up to a switch.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Is there any function in a switch that can work as Link Fault Pass Through?
 The reason is I am using leaf switches between spine and core, and in the event of a spine failure I need the end client in the leaf to have its port disabled.
 For redundancy purposes. So let&#x27;s say if one port would fail, I would need the other port to fail too.
 I am not sure if this is possible to program or there is this protocol.
 Switches are Catalyst 9300 and CBS350 X

                              <span>Hello everyone! New guy here.. So as the title states I&#x27;ve been working for the past 4 months on a container vessel, old ship but new network from top to bottom. From the start the Internet connection was weak even while being connected to the closest satelite available. We&#x27;ve done everything we could together with the IT department. We&#x27;ve been allocated the maximum available bandwidth, they have redone the firewall policies and available ports but still extremely weak connection with the outside.
 One thing that kept reoccurring in our conversations was their inability to maintain a stable connection while connecting to our servers and the fact that there is a loop in our network.
 My problem is that on local network everything seems to work perfectly fine. NAS file transfers are snappy, …</span>

                              <span>We have a network with subnet mask as /22 (or 255.255.252.0) on all devices (and all devices are in a single network.)
 No sub-netting has been done (it was setup that from the beginning) and there are over 500 devices (User PCs and servers) Connected using L2+ switches (Cisco and D-Link).
 Frequently we find &quot;LDB Loop detected&quot; error message logged in our network switches even when there are no actual (physical) loop in our network and this message is logged in some switches and at random times. 
 After Auto error recovery timeout exceeds the set value of 60 seconds the port gets re-enabled and switches function normally without showing any loopback messages. During this entire time of event “No physical changes” were done to the network.
 I have checked all the switch logs and tried to find any physical loops in our network , but found none.
 I did a Google search to check if &quot;large numbers of IP’s or devices can cause Loopback error &quot; but could not find any posts regarding the same incident. One of the posts that I had gone through indicated that &quot;large numbers of IP’s or devices&quot; might not cause Loopback problem.
 My experience in Networking is limited. Any veterans could confirm if, 
  
Can Loopback error occur commonly if there are large numbers of devices in a subnet?
 Just wondering whether having a large single subnet (net mask 255.255.248.0) with 2000+ assignable IP addresses but with just 100 devices also causes Loopback error.
  
Any help is appreciated.

 I never used SevOne before and hope you could give me some advice.
 What are the most useful indicators I should track?
 Any newbie advice you can give me?
 How to set useful thresholds to manage alerts?
 Thanks in advance!

 So for the past few months I have finally constructed my homelab to a point where I would consider it &quot;stable&quot; but &quot;rolling release&quot; esque. It works, but I keep doing minor adjustments to it as new versions come out and as I fine-tune settings. But, it does what I need it to. And now I want to preserve that - and I want to do that real good.
 First, a bit about my setup:
  
Desktop and Laptop with Windows 10
 Mini Server (FriendlyElec NanoPi R6s) with OpenWrt 22 + Docker containers
 Two remote servers (small VPSes) with Debian 11 each
 Synology NAS DS413j
 I have a Wasabi subscription
  
My plan is to set up a backup repository on my NAS and then send that into my Wasabi storage as an off-site solution with the encryption keys stored separately as a copy in Proton Drive…</span>

Anyway, I&#x27;ve been looking for an hour and (you know how this goes) for whatever reason i can&#x27;t find that perfectly google&#x27;d article showing me exactly how to do it.
 anyway, i have a 365 tenant with 2 separate companies (formerly one company, big expansion, still friendly) and company B needs to set up a team with their own domain on the email address. i need to allow teams to be created with a choice of email domains - either Company A dot com or Company B dot com.
 is this a powershell email address policy issue or is there an easier way to do it? I am all about easy.
 Thanks in advance to you young whippersnappers with good eyes. I used to make fun of guys like me. They were usually big Novell proponents!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in IT for over 15 years, but new to sharepoint. I hate it with the darkest passion. Here&#x27;s an example why. 
 User calls and wants a way to let 3 people edit an excel file at once. They also want to share it with mobile users as read only. (Its a schedule of sorts). No problem, this sounds like a problem for sharepoint!
 So, you create a new sharepoint site. You set yourself as the the owner, because your the IT admin, that&#x27;s why. Now you go to your sharepoint sites list. Its not there, under recent or favorites. Why, b/c its new! But your the owner. Tough. 
 So you go back to admin and find the the URL. Now you want to set security permissions. Oh look, Microsoft created groups already, in O365. But I want to use my existing AD groups. Tough, we created groups and REALLY want you…</span>

 Recently a few of the techs I manage have received those &quot;You&#x27;re IT you should know this&quot; comments from users for software such as Excel or certain Adobe CC applications. We purchase the licensing for most applications as well as install them and troubleshoot basic issues but we are not familiar with the daily use of the applications.
 ​
 What is a diplomatic way of responding to these comments? They often come from people in C-level/executive positions.

                              <span>Microsoft is forcing people to deprecate internet explorer... fine, makes sense. It&#x27;s actually long overdue.
 The authentication popup from most of the O365 powershell modules - even the latest ExchangeOnline Powershell 3.0 - is actually rendered by internet explorer (Microsoft is an exception to their own forced deprecation), not edge, and cannot do FIDO2 keys.
 So, a password and MS Authenticator or another legacy MFA method that isn&#x27;t hardware secured, needs to be an option for Administrators, the ones who really need the most security and should be using FIDO2. All because Microsoft is an exception to one of their own rules that they have assured the rest of the industry no one really needs exceptions to because re-developing for Edge is so easy and long overdue.
 Hypocrisy at its finest.

 QNAP’s advisory on Monday said that network-attached storage devices running QTS versions before 5.0.1.2234 and QuTS Hero versions prior to h5.0.1.2248 were vulnerable. 
 If exploited, this vulnerability allows remote attackers to inject malicious code.
 Of course your QNAP probably shouldnt be web accessible... but according to some articles at least 29,000 are. No public POC or Exploit yet but it will come.

                              <span>This might not exactly be a /r/sysadmin topic, but I imagine A/V rolls up to a lot of you at SMBs, so I figure this is probably the community with the highest # of folks that have direct experience supporting end users / corporate A/V.
 I&#x27;m looking for a universal solution that allows for wireless screen sharing (i.e. presenting from a device to a large display in a conference room).
 To date, we&#x27;ve been using ClickShare since that seemed to be the most device agnostic solution, but now that a lot of newer computers (especially MacBooks) have completely gotten rid of USB type A connectors, we&#x27;re finding it less suitable than it used to be. And, hard as it is to believe, we&#x27;ve actually had a non-zero instance of people leaving with the ClickShare buttons!
 MiraCast is a decent solution for Windows devices, but my understanding is MiraCast is completely unsupported on Macs.
 It seems like there are relatively simple solutions that can be made to work with certain types of devices (i.e. an AppleTV is simple for Macs), but finding a universal solution that works with Win/Mac (and ideally iOS/Android too) seems to be a challenge.
 In a perfect world, it seems like there ought to be some sort of lightweight software agent that doesn&#x27;t require any client-side hardware (or admin privileges) and would work across all these device types. I.E. - post a URL in the meeting room - visitors go there to download the agent, which automagically connects them to the A/V system in the room. Does such a thing exist?

                              <span>Been working at this medium sized corporation for a year now. It&#x27;s all on-site, as they say they&#x27;re a family business... That being said, a few duties of my job include, maintaining the corporate network, maintaining our cyber risk standards (updates, anti-virus, MFA, etcetc), and Helpdesk for other employees.
 What&#x27;s interesting is that over the year, I&#x27;ve been introduced into a few of the other random things IT &#x27;takes care&#x27; of.
 We have 2 restaurants in the building that both use an outdated POS system. The guy who maintained the backend left a few months back, so now I&#x27;m in control of adding food buttons, prices, taxes and making sure the numbers match in the reports. (That should be a finance dept. thing)
 I&#x27;m being trained in SQL, so that I can be a backup once our programmer leaves. But I really don&#x27;t care for programming. We&#x27;re looking into Interns/hiring so I don&#x27;t understand why we just find someone who likes SQL.
 I also have to setup most of the meetings for the execs; Which I&#x27;m not really surprised about. Just annoying as it takes me away from what I was working on especially on their &#x27;meeting days&#x27;.
 And, I&#x27;ve been making the graphics for a few displays in our employee break rooms that include whatever deals we currently have for employees, position postings, inspirational posts. We have a marketing\graphics team, but I think they don&#x27;t even know about them.
 This seems to be a thing that happens in all departments though. My friend in Marketing gets the &#x27;privilege&#x27; of driving the co-owner home when he has a fun night at the bar. Keep in mind the drive is 45 mins there and 45 back. And our AV guy has to change the movie that plays on loop in the co-owner&#x27;s office whenever he calls.
 Overall it&#x27;s a interesting place to work. Anyone else have some whacky side duties you got stuck with?

 The problem I have is users typically go To Power and click Disconnect at the end of the day, just wondering if anyone has a Registry hack or anything that I can do to have Sign Out there rather than Disconnect?
 Educating the users to go to Start, Clicking Their Profile and then Sign Out is too much for them.
 Any suggestions, or solutions anyone has would be great to hear :)
 Thanks in advanced!

 Seeing conflicting info. For what its worth, if anything, MSFT support said, &quot;yes&quot; Although extremely skeptical of them.

                              <span>Finally getting around to addressing MFA. I&#x27;m looking at Duo, but it seems to have a limitation for protecting powershell and non-interactive logons. The primary driver here is to add a control to manage ransomware/malware risk as well as cybersecurity insurance requirements. I&#x27;m not really worried about hands on keyboard protection as much. Is there a solution that addresses PS and non-interactive logons?

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a script to do this job for me. I&#x27;m running into a variable issue that I&#x27;m hoping someone will know the answer to. Here is my code currently:
 #Get sAMAccountName and write to array (Change -Identity to * when running against all users)
 $sam &#x3D; Get-ADUser -Server domain.domain -Filter * -SearchBase &quot;OU dist name&quot; | select sAMAccountName
 #Write the extensionAttribute1 value for each user in the array
 foreach ($user in $sam)
 {
 Set-ADUser $user.sAMAccountName -Replace @{extensionAttribute1 &#x3D; &quot;$user@thing.thing&quot;}
 }
 This works except the resulting attribute is &quot;@{sAMAccountName&#x3D;samaccountname}@thing.thing&quot;
 Can anyone tell me what syntax to use so that it only uses the samaccountname instead of prefixing the attribute? Compared to a PS veteran I&#x27;m probably making a mess of this...

                              <span>We have very basic security at our company of 50-75 employees as it has never been prioritized.
 During the past few months we made our first baby steps by deploying:
 - 2FA for domain admins (yes, I don&#x27;t know why this was never a thing, but it tells a story)
 - On-premise password manager
 - Bitlocker
 - Changed some password of domain accounts that hadn&#x27;t been changed in years
 ​
 This is all great, but it&#x27;s not much. The management is quite strict about what security measure can be deploye, as it must not be too annoying for employees.
 What are the next steps to take? Annoying or not.

                              <span>Hi all:
 We&#x27;re migrating from SCEP to Defender for Endpoint and I&#x27;d like some confirmation/guidance on my plan.
 We&#x27;re fully on-prem and utilize SCCM/MECM with the built in SCEP - no Azure or Intune - yet. 
 Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but in order to deploy Defender for Endpoint, we will need to enable Co-management in SCCM in order to get the devices into Intune, and then onboard the devices into Endpoint via SCCM? 
 Thanks for any suggestions!

                              <span>Per the subject, I&#x27;ve been dipping my toes into Autopilot and when it works, it&#x27;s great.
 We enrolled 10+ devices and they worked exactly how we wanted but we&#x27;ve been aiming to further streamline things so I&#x27;ve been tested by resetting my spare laptop.
 Unfortunately I&#x27;ve just started running into issues where my spare laptop and another (which just needed to be reset) that have successfully Autopilot in the past (and have had no hardware changes) have suddenly started failing to Autopilot and instead continue with the standard Windows setup.
 During the Autopilot process CTRL+SHIFT+D simply shows &quot;User-based Azure AD Join - required error event data incomplete or missing&quot;
 If I check the Event Log I can see
 &quot;Event ID 704 - Autopilot downloader retrieved an empty profile for DdzZtdPolicyManager&quot; where on devices it&#x27;s been successful in the past we can see &quot;Autopilot downloader retrieved a new profile for DdsZtdPolicyManager.&quot;
 Unfortunately I&#x27;ve not been able to find anything useful for diagnosing why we&#x27;d get an empty profile. I&#x27;ve tried completely removing the device from Autopilot and AzureAD and then using Get-WindowsAutopilotinfo -Online from OOBE to push the serial and hash again but I continue to experience the same problem. The devices are still present in InTune and have profiled assigned.
 Just wondered if anyone had any pointers for diagnosing why we&#x27;d retrieve an empty profile before I bang my head on a wall with Microsoft?

 Have a field in AD with their favorite ice cream flavor? Go to a website and have them use their U2F? Is there a product that can be deployed that ‘just works’?
 Honestly… just curious what others are doing.

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;ve been using both pfSense and Synology&#x27;s OpenVPN server options. Both work great but there is an issue on the pfSense server: when I access with a device through the VPN, it cannot ping or see Windows machines, unless I disable the firewall. But when I use Synology&#x27;s OpenVPN, I don&#x27;t need to disable the firewall. I suppose there&#x27;s a solution that can be applied on the pfSense side, without having to mess around with Windows Firewall rules, but I don&#x27;t know what should I do because I don&#x27;t even know why these Windows machines are blocking that traffic.
 My pfSense is currently set in this way:
 - 1 port for WAN.
 - 3 extra ports for LAN that are bridged to work like a hub/switch. This bridge is the DHCP server.
 - Firewall rules to allow traffic between the ports on the pfsense mini-pc to the rest of the network. 
 Everything works just fine but when it comes to openVPN, I have the firewall issue with Windows.
 Any ideas?
 Thanks for the help! 🙏

                              <span>We are having an issue with one of our EMR apps that connects via RDWeb. We experience intermittent connection issues between the hours of 8-10 AM in the beginning of the month or end of the month.
 I have been banging my head on the desk for months trying to figure out why this is the case.
 We have a app company that manages the app and we have an app consultant on site for a few days a week to help with any issues. I have checked the computer resources and nothing (CPU, Ethernet Task Manager tasks) even spikes when it runs or trying to connect.
 I&#x27;ve run wireshark scans both inside and outside the network. Outside the network it appears to connect via UDP while inside the network it appears to connect via HTTP. Outside the network there is never any problems and the loading takes much quicker.
 Issues I have encountered are slow typing within the app, having to end the RDS sessions and then connect the users again (sometimes this even chokes at first time login), and of course users not being able to login at all. This also happens on completely random computers throughout the month and NEVER at the same time. 
 They can hit the RDWeb url just fine and download the RDP app just fine, and we can use all other websites/apps just fine. It&#x27;s just getting in and STAYING in that is an issue.
 I&#x27;m thinking there has to be a feature that prioritizes who or how many people can continuously connect to this app at the same time or something on the network.
 I&#x27;m also thinking that it has to do with the fact that we HAVE to use HTTP instead of UDP.
 Is there anything else we can try to stabilize the connection? Would looking into some event logs on the PCs help?

 Familiar with splunk, datadog, and the elk stack, all of which seem to be relatively expensive or overkill for such a tiny server.
 Any low cost, lightweight alternatives?

 Sure, I could manually construct a PoSh command that would have the same/similar result. I’m just surprised/frustrated that I cant do something the GUI can, with PoSh. 
 Am I wrong? 🙏🏼

                              <span>Hey guys, got a strange issue that has come-and-gone for me a few times. I&#x27;ve had some success that one day it works, but most days it does not.
 I am greeted with this upon opening RDS in server manager:
 https://i.imgur.com/z4z5bRA.png
 Yet all my servers are added in server manager:

 And running from powershell yields:

 ​
 I&#x27;ve tried server manager from RSAT, server manager from all 3 of our brokers, yet I&#x27;m given the same message, and at this point I&#x27;m stumped. My google searches are telling me to add them in server manager, but that&#x27;s definitely not the issue.
 ​
 As well, the rest of the RDS environment is working perfectly fine. All users are connecting to all of our sessions just fine.

                              <span>Govt Contractor in IT. I&#x27;ve been at the job for not even half a year but there has been 0 issues and everything has been great. However, I found a new career opportunity that I cannot pass up and put my heart and soul into the resume/essay to get in...and now I can&#x27;t get my mind off of this potential career.
 Main concern is that I&#x27;ll be &quot;let go&quot; or terminated since my company can terminate &quot;at will&quot; meaning they could probably easily terminate me from this contract once I tell them about my wishes to pursue another career. Supervisor and I are on great terms but are at no means close or friends. 
 To anyone with experience in this situation, how would you notify your supervisor of this new job you want to apply for and explain that if you don&#x27;t get accepted, you would still be happy to keep working in the current position?

 Today it was certbot, I do not install it often and had forgotten the damn package name so I simply google it because I don&#x27;t have a terminal open (Writing script) and their official website wants me to first install snapd and then install certbot?
 I find snap being super annoying and less convient to automate around than my trusty old APT. 
 I mean it&#x27;s faster to type AND EXECUTE apt update &amp;&amp; apt install -y python3-certbot than to first install snap, and then install certbot. What&#x27;s the benefit of snap?!
 Am I just set in my ways and should learn to use it or do most of you also think snap is garbage and an extra layer that&#x27;s not really neccessary?

 I have a problem using Microsoft Teams and hope that one of you knows a solution. When calls are forwarded, new phone calls are no longer displayed for the person who forwarded the call. This ALSO results in the person to whom the call was forwarded receiving further calls while a call is in progress.
 Has anyone experienced the same problem and found a solution? I am also not quite sure how to even troubleshoot this.
 Many thanks in advance!

 I&#x27;m going through the AD for one of our clients and trying to clean it up a bit. How can I tell which objects a security group is applied to. I can&#x27;t see it in the GUI so I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s a powershell job?
 What&#x27;s the easiest was to go about this? Thanks.

                              <span>Hi
 I have a domain where my service provider is name.com
 ​
 From 27th Jan, I can no longer receive any emails whatsoever, but can send to anyone. 
 ​
 The errors I&#x27;m receiving are various but mostly claims that some google IP is in an RBL
 ​
 My provider has only given me wrong answers and asked me to do things to buy them time, such as changing my DNS records including my MX records, which requires up to 72 hours to be fully reflected everywhere
 ​
 I have compiled some info from here and there and I can&#x27;t figure out what to do, my provider is not supporting me at all, what to do?

                              <span>Hi r/sysadmin
 I am involved in migrating on-prem infrastructure to 365/Azure etc for many SMB&#x27;s, but I just cannot get Sharepoint online working reliably. It seems to work fine for smaller sites, but the larger the customer, the more problems they have with it.
 I am migrating on prem shares into Sharepoint - giving each share its own site. I then either deploy the share via Intune so that it appears in the Explorer sidebar, or simply have the customer &quot;add shortcut to OneDrive&quot; 
 The thing is, I&#x27;m constantly having OneDrive sync issues. Either it gets stuck syncing, doesn&#x27;t sync everything, gives errors when downloading cloud files through explorer etc, and it&#x27;s overall a very poor experience for the customer. 
 Doing things via the web browser is fine, but doesn&#x27;t offer the old school functionality of accessing files via explorer.
 What am I doing wrong? It&#x27;s driving me up the wall! The amount of times I&#x27;ve had to reinstall OneDrive/resync data is absurd.

                              <span>We are a mid-size company, in Italy. 300 people. We are in the process of evaluating alternatives in order to migrate our two nodes HCI cluster (backed by HPE StoreVirtual VSA solution).
 We arleady received quotations for HPE SimpiVity.
 I am waiting for a VMWare vSAN quotation.
 Today I received a quotation from a local reseller of IT solutions for a two nodes, HCI cluster, whose brand is &quot;Syneto&quot; (Syneto.eu the site). Honestly I never heard about it, and also by googling for it I do not find any relevant result, if not by Syneto itself, or from some tech site article promoting it. Here on reddit I did not find anything.
 Have any of you had experiences with this brand or heard about it from some other people in terms of reliability and maturity?
 Thank you

                              <span>Totally at a loss here, so wondering if anyone else has come across this.
 The firm likes to send out a monthly newsletter (amongst other things), and to do this, they use Mailchimp. This is fine, I&#x27;ve created the relevant DNS records and such, and all is well. However, the way Mailchimp links images rather than embeds means that Outlook doesn&#x27;t display images by default. The only way around this, that I&#x27;m aware off, is to set the sender in Safe (Trusted) Senders and Domains for all users
 I&#x27;ve done this via a PowerShell script:
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60; Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName user@example.com 
 $users &#x3D; Get-Mailbox -ResultSize unlimited -RecipientTypeDetails UserMailbox 
 foreach ($user in $users) {
 Set-MailboxJunkEmailConfiguration &quot;$($user.UserPrincipalName)&quot; -TrustedSendersAndDomains @{Add&#x3D;&quot;mail.example.com&quot;} }
 &#x60;&#x60;&#x60;
 I have also try to only do one user, eg. Set-MailboxJunkEmailConfiguration &quot;user@example.com&quot; -TrustedSendersAndDomains @{Add&#x3D;&quot;mail.example.com&quot;}
 Either way I do this though, the change shows up when I look at junk settings in OWA or Outlook 365 desktop, but within 10 minutes, it&#x27;s no longer in there, almost as if the change has been undone
 If I manually add the domain to my safe senders list, it remains there absolutely fine, so I don&#x27;t believe this is some rogue setting or script that&#x27;s clearing out the safe senders list

                              <span>Got a Dell WD22TB4 docking station from work which I am using to connect to a Huawei GT 34 monitor, got it primarily for ease of switching seamlessly between work and personal laptops. However, when plugged into my personal HP Envy x360 laptop, the monitor randomly goes black like it is dropping connection fairly frequently. This doesn&#x27;t happen with my work laptop which is a Dell. Any suggestions for a potential fix? Happens with both a USB-C connection from monitor to dock and DP connection from monitor to dock.

 I&#x27;m looking to do the MS Azure Administrator Course during my free time off work.I have setup a basic on premise Windows Server 2022 for the labs that require on-prem activities.
 The question is more on the Azure licenses required to &quot;fully&quot; go through learning lab scenarios.
 I have registered for a free Azure account and gone through a few initial basic labs scenarios. But as i move on to further lab scenarios, i realise there are many options not available to me.
 I have seen that there is this &quot;Pay As You Go&quot; subscription and also subscriptions such as &quot;Basic (Which is the free), Developer, Standard&quot; and as well as others such as &quot;P1, P2, etc&quot;
 As this is for self learning lab scenarios, I would just need the functions there. There wont be 1000 users using the full MS Azure suite. There will only be 1 admin and 1 test user for the scenarios.
 Can someone anyone who knows or have gone through the same situation as me advise what is the most &quot;basic&quot; subscription to be able to at least have most of the functions to complete the AZ104 course/labs scenarios.
 Thanks in advance!!

                              <span>Hi Good Folks,
 ​
 Questions to those who used Azure Virtual Desktop in their environment. I am new to Azure Virtual Desktop, and have a few questions that I am hoping some of you kind people might enlighten me on.
 (1) If we already have some Azure presence, like existing vNet, can we integrate it with AVD?
 (2) If we can&#x27;t integrate it with our vNet, what are other options (like using client VPN, things like that)?
 (3) From the cost perspective what are the options if we have general users and more power users What is a better way to organize those?
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hello,
 i need some help on our rds hosts. Some specifiations:
 We have 6 RDS (Server 2019) and one Broker for about 220 user. All RDS have 16 Cores and 64 GB Ram and sitting on a full flash SAN. No GPU. All virtualized on Hyper-V 2019.
 Sometimes user reporting that the server feels slow. If i go to the user and look at his problem i can confirm this problem. The monitoring of the host itself seems okay. CPU wise we are about 20 % with some peaks, but very rarely over 80 %. RAM wise also about 60 %. Disk i/o and network are not real latency. 
 The problems for the users are mostly slow responding applications (not crashing) while moving the windows, latency on typing in different applications, and some other stuff. 
 For a small test i removed our anti virus (Sophos) but that does not help.
 If i read some old threads here on reddit most other people have much more user per server without issues. So it does not seem an issue on the user/server ratio.
 ATM i&#x27;m thinking about buying a hardware server with an GPU to test it. Hyper-V does not really support GPU partitioning or passthrough. We tried RemoteFX last year, but that does not really work.
 So maybe some of you have some input where i can solve my performance issue on these server.
 Thanks.

 All was working fine before upgrading the user to windows 10. After which whenever the user tries to Open Calendar - From Room List, it always says &#x27;No Connection&#x27; and doesnt show anything in the calendar. However, if the user logs in OWA, and views the same calendar all items appear.
 I have tried the following;
 Repaired Office
 Installed Latest updates
 Rebuilt .OSD
 Disabled/Enabled &#x27;Use Cached Exchanged Mode&#x27;
 Ran outlook in Safe Mode
 Disabled all add-ons and added each one back one by one.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>Hey everybody,
 Brief context: We have(had) 2 DCs, but one got corrupted during a server migration (things seemed fine for a good while, I was sleeping post-surgery but my director and team member didn’t want to wait until the next Friday, also didn’t follow my migration procedure but it’s fine) and we ended up seeing SID errors in the AD resulting in newer user accounts being auto-deleted, etc etc.
 Troubleshooting went nowhere.
 Solution was: shut off DC2 and see if DC1 has issues by itself. It didn’t. Awesome.
 Now: DC1 is online, DC2 is offline but never demoted (and VM has no NIC config), DC02 (new VM) is a trigger pull away from backing up DC1.
 Questions: 1) If I add DC02 as a DC to the domain using “any dc” as a replication source, can I change this later? (Because I might like to make this “only DC1,” temporarily, which brings us to… 2) I want to bring DC2 online to properly demote it, but how can I ensure it won’t torpedo DC1 with bad/redundant records as soon as they reunite? Can I just (while DC2 still has no network config) set their sync relationship to be 1-way, give it network access again, demote it, shut it down for good? 3) Depending on 2)’s answer, should DC02 be held offline and not joined to the domain until DC2 is gone for good? Or is it safer to add it, test it, then shut it down while sorting DC1&amp;2 so that, if they implode, I can just shut them down and bring up DC02?

                              <span>So have this dilemma, who ever built this machine I&#x27;m working on has partioned the drive rather odd,
 ​
 Windows server, 2012, 200gb hard drive, 40 to windows, 130 to a second partition and the rest unallocated space.
 ​
 I cannot for the life of me find free software that will allow me to use the merge partition open within windows server, i have Aoemi for my home pc which works wonders but that version dont work on server, every free product ive tried seems to be restricted in the way that merge is not covered under free features, or requires a server version of the software which locks that feature out.
 ​
 Any suggestions on one that will allow me to do it so i dont need to get the company to buy something

 This is HPE DL380 Gen10+, with two MR416i-p RAID controllers.
 But the problem is this is brand new Server, i just updated the SPP like i always did, it worked yesterday properly and now when i turned it on it shows the message from the top of the post, and when i go to system configuration it doesn&#x27;t show the Second RAID controller. I rebooted it once and it worked properly, there was no message. Now after i rebooted it once again there is that warning message again, but the RAID is showing up properly in ilo, and also showing up peoperly in system configuration.
 Should i continue and configure this controller oand just ignore the message?

 Anyway am sure there is a way to view the actual message while checking the alert on Purview or Defender but all I seem able to see is information about the message and not the content itself. 
 I vaguely remember it being some very obscure Purview or compliance role needed (I’m global admin) but can’t see anything on there or on Google to point me in the right direction and it’s driving me mad! 
 Help appreciated thanks all!

 Users reporting both on enterprise and home networks. Pretty vanilla image with MDT.
 Left scratching my head to fix it. I&#x27;ve tried Windows drivers, Lenovo drivers, Lenovo system centre software to handle drivers.
 Can&#x27;t pin point the cause... Appears to happen mostly on windows resume from laptop lid beong opened, but some are saying it happens while working.
 Pretty much every device is affected. School environment so people are spitting chips about restarting multiple times a day.
 Any thoughts on how I can diagnose this? Lenovo hasn&#x27;t been super helpful

 Any suggestions? We would likely end up with a couple exceptions so looking for a tool/solution that can provide that.

                              <span>Hello Everyone,
 ​
 I have a bootable usb that contains the OS for Dell Wyse Thinclient ( Windows 10 Enterprise LTSC 2019 ).
 ​
 I have managed to clone the bootable usb locally using the Dell Wyse Imaging Tool, but I need to send this bootable USB to another location where I cannot send a physical USB thumb drive.
 ​
 How can I create an ISO of the bootable usb, so that I can send send that ISO to the remote computer, and from there, I would be able to use Rufus to create a bootable USB.

                              <span>I’m currently an IS major in my junior year of college and I have been looking into my future career path heavily. I have an internship this summer for IT Infrastructure Systems, but after reading through this subreddit I’m having second thoughts.
 Everyone on here seems stressed, overworked, and underpaid. I have a friend back at home starting his first full time firefighting paramedic job that tops out around $100k. Not to mention he’s keeping his part time gig so he’s going to be raking in around $130k-$140k a year. Also, as if that wasn’t good enough, he’s always able to play video games with me on his PS5 at the station while he’s not running a call.
 Am I getting into the wrong profession? I love technology and fixing things, but if I can get paid more to do a job that provides a better work life balance, I might have to consider doing that.
 Does anyone here enjoy their job? Is everyone here underpaid? Is this career just an endless pit of stress and boredom?

                              <span>I started running into an issue a few weeks ago where my domains&#x27; SSL wasn&#x27;t being automatically renewed any more, and my certs started to expire, even though dehydrated was running daily as it should.
 It was running daily, but it was stuck: the process was still showing in ps the next day. Dehydrated and its helpers are all bash scripts, so I was able to throw set -o xtrace at the top to see what bash was running, and this was the offending block:
 cliip&#x3D;&#x60;$CURL -s https://v4.ifconfig.co/ip&#x60; while ! valid_ip $cliip; do sleep 2 cliip&#x3D;&#x60;$CURL -s https://v4.ifconfig.co/ip&#x60; done 
 This is a block of code in the Dehydrated helper script for Namecheap, that detects the running machine&#x27;s IP. Except if the call fails, it gets stuck forever sleeping every 2 seconds and trying again. And as it turns out, the v4 and v6 subdomains to ifconfig.co were deprecated in 2018 and finally removed in January sometime.
 So the upshot is that v4.ifconfig.co/ip should be changed to ifconfig.co and your Dehydrated/Namecheap setup will come back to life.
 Also, set -o xtrace is a lifesaver for debugging Bash scripts that are getting stuck.

                              <span>I am ok with getting around and configuring via CLI on our HP Pro Curve switches but have not added additional ones before. I am going to be out soon for surgery and my boss wants me to create a second admin account for temp help to use while I&#x27;m out. I&#x27;m pretty sure this is very simple but I&#x27;m just not getting it. Every time I run the following command it just resets the name and password of the current admin account. If there is a way how do I add an additional admin account?

                              <span>I do networking in my day job, but I&#x27;ve been casually looking around at other infrastructure roles that are out there and a lot of them want CI/CD and Kubernetes. 
 Please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but my understanding is the having a CI/CD pipeline is primarily for if you have some kind of application that you&#x27;re hosting and constantly developing. (And K8 is for managing all the docker containers running those applications). 
 Maybe I&#x27;m looking at this wrong, but I don&#x27;t see how any of that interacts with a role where the primary task is maintaining and building a network. (And thus the dilemma (when it comes to applying for other roles) that I&#x27;ve never interacted with any of these things outside of youtube videos and playing around with small scale versions in my home lab) 
 I get the idea of treating your network configs as code and keeping them in some kind of VCS like git, but does anyone actually have a CI/CD pipeline for pushing networking config changes? How would you even write tests for something like that, that you could then put in some kind of automated pipeline?

                              <span>Hi team.
 I have a needance to create a model for a Cisco 1900 model, wich no one existing model works.
 This Cisco model have an &quot;User Interface Menu&quot; before ask for credentials, showing &quot;Press any key to continue.&quot;.
 After, it pass to a other user interaction in witch ask for &quot;K&quot; key to enter in CLI mode.
 I havent success to create a model with &quot;expect&quot; to handle it.
 Has anyone ever had a problem with this?

                              <span>Currently running Cisco across the whole campus, but planning to upgrade the wireless equipment this year and then upgrade our switches next year. Trying to convince my boss to abandon Cisco because I’m sick of them, so he wants to put together a list of alternatives. 
 After talking to our VAR and doing a lot of research, it seems like the top choices would be: Mist, Aruba, or Arista. Personally I’m leaning towards Mist, but curious to see what everyone else thinks. I like their management software and if they can actually reduce support tickets anywhere in the realm of what their salesperson claims it would be a huge benefit. 
 Any mist users out there? Or anyone who thinks Aruba/Cisco/Arista is a better option?
 Edit: to clarify, campus is how we refer to our corporate head quarters (mid-sized company with ~1k employees at HQ). We are not an actual college campus.

 I have tried using a usb c cable to connect the two devices, however I am unable to see the Moxa using either putty or the PCO terminal emulator. I have also tried looking under device manager for a usb adaptor under the COM port, but I only see standard serial over Bluetooth links

                              <span>I&#x27;ve started to play around with the VMware SD-WAN (née Velocloud) API. I&#x27;ve had a lot of success with gathering information using basic GET requests but I&#x27;ve been struggling to understand using it for configuration. For example, say I want to change the management traffic override setting. According to the docs I need to send a PATCH request with a &#x27;PatchSchema&#x27; array:
 VMware&#x27;s example:
 { &quot;PatchSchema&quot;: [ { &quot;op&quot;: &quot;replace&quot;, &quot;path&quot;: &quot;/softwareUpdate/windowed&quot;, &quot;value&quot;: true } ] } 
 This particular setting needs a DeviceSettingsLANManagementTraffic object, with both fields described as optional:
 { &quot;override&quot;: false, &quot;sourceInterface&quot;: &quot;string&quot; } 
 I&#x27;m using Python&#x27;s Requests library, but here is VMware&#x27;s example using cURL:

 We were cabling a server the other day and one link (10Gb fiber) just wouldn&#x27;t come up on the designated port. We moved it to another port to test and still no light. However, it seems the test port was probably shutdown; as was the port we were trying originally. There was a mistake in the cabling documentation so they were plugging into the wrong ports.
 So I should just be able to fix the documentation and send the guys back out to cable it right? But I thought a port would still show some type of link lights if it was shutdown, which makes me think there&#x27;s still something else broken if true.
 We did test the fiber cable, NIC, and GBIC on a known-working port and it all worked.
 I don&#x27;t have physical access to this equipment to check for myself.
 Edit: this has been answered. Thanks!

 Neither one of my switches can see my my endpoint device&#x27;s mac address in their tables. However, the 4500 shows its mac address in its arp table, linked to the correct IP address on the correct vlan.
 My question is - how does this happen? Can some endpoints prevent their hardware address from showing up in l2 tables somehow?

                              <span>So, we got a slew of new MS devices and generally they&#x27;re working fine. Catalyst core, but still trunking is working for everything and there are very few problems (except Playstations. FU Playstations). 
 But we have these CBORD devices that handle Student Payments (at Soda Machines, et al) and Card Swipy devices for CheckIn type things. When plugged into the Catalyst they work just fine. No PoE needed and they pull their reserved IP no problem. Can see it on the Catalyst CLI, can Ping it, everything is great. 
 Swap that plug to a Meraki switch and the port DOESN&#x27;T EVEN ACTIVATE. No link lights, nothing. As far as Meraki is telling me there is no device plugged into that port. I&#x27;ve tried multiple ports on multiple switches now - same issue. Works on Catalyst just fine, Meraki doesn&#x27;t want anything to do with it. The VLAN in use is one of the most widely used VLANs but I still went up and down the line to verify connectivity. 
 Has anyone ever encountered anything like this?

                              <span>Hello friends, 
 I hope some of you great people might be able to help. I’m conducting an experiment for my studies where I am measuring routing protocol convergence performance in a simulated and real hardware environment. 
 I am struggling to make sense of how to calculate the convergence itself. Do I ping the host on the other end of the network continuously, and then shutdown an interface and time a change or do I simulate a data packet through Cisco simulation during which I shutdown the port to see how the routing protocol reacts?
 For my simulated part I am using the CPT simulator. For my real hardware I plan on using a Wireshark. Has anyone any idea how to measure the convergence times? I have browsed through the net but not to luck so far. 
 Your help is greatly appreciated! 
 Tia

                              <span>Does anyone know if controllers (particularly, 1832 Mobility Express virtual controllers) rate-limit or shape traffic per client when the client load is high and if so, where can I turn that off at? I have a site that typically has 80 users connected to the wireless at any given time. Daily total bytes pushed through the wireless is 1.4 terabytes (you read that right). As such, when I look at the speeds my clients are pushing, most are in the Kbps range, and some are in the low Mbps range (2-5Mbps per client). The site only has a 100Mbps pipe.
 Logically speaking, I have to imagine if my users are pushing 1.4TB through the wireless in 24 hours (site is 24/7), and the WAN pipe is 100Mbps, then the Mobility Express controller instance has to be rate-limiting the connections somewhere, independent of the maximum amount of bandwidth allowed per client slider under RF Optimization in expert view.
 Does anyone know, and if so, can you direct me to where I can tweak that? I&#x27;m getting slowness complaints from the site, but with 80 people using the wifi at that level of data, you kinda have to expect that no?

 ​
 I&#x27;ve heard a common practice is that a machine is typically given less access than a user when authenticating. What do you typically provide the machine access to?
 ​
 Items that come to mind for me include AD related services to local DCs, any applicable monitoring services, Internet-access to Microsoft for updates/etc. 
 ​
 What am I missing? I know mileage may vary, but can never hurt to get everyone&#x27;s best practices and prior experience.

 Is it possible to do something similar on the Cisco ASR9K series, or Cisco NCS5K series? I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s not possible but thought I would ask.
 The reason for wanting to run something like thiswould be:
  
Single logical device to manage
 Ability to use less IPv4 addresses (Not have to run VRRP etc)

                              <span>Hi fellow network engineers
 I am eager to develop greater networking skills and want to set up the most optimal and cheapest lab environment.
 For me, virtualisation is the best option for its scalability and variety. I have used both GNS3 and EVE-NG in the past (on my Windows computer with VMware Workstation/VirtualBox and even in the Google Cloud). I have enjoyed them both greatly but at the moment would choose EVE-NG.
 Right now I have a MacBook so virtualisation is not really an option for me since it is Silicon/ARM based. Google Cloud is too expensive for the amount of CPUs and RAM I need for a good lab (&gt;24vCPU and 48RAM, also the resources are not always available in zones which is really frustrating). I could just buy a used bare-metal server for my virtualisation but I am not sure I will have room for it but it is an option I am considering.
 I need the to emulate different vendors so CML is not an option for me as well.
 Could you suggest the most practical and least expensive way to setup a lab?
 What has your experience been with it? Every little tip and suggestion is most helpful, thank you.

                              <span>Hello! Maybe there is an obvious solution to this that I don&#x27;t see right away. 
 However, at my work location the inbound ISP connection is very close to some windows and a door. These could easily be broken into and if I place my network gear (NAS in particular) close to there, the thieves could just snatch them and be gone in like 3 minutes.
 Unfortunately, there isn&#x27;t really anyothers placement inside the work location that is suitable for a serverrack, so I&#x27;m stuck with the options of
  
Mount metal rods across the windows and doors to prevent break in. This is not optimal because it&#x27;s ugly as hell and will also trigger curiosity for the criminals who are looking. I would rather that my location seem inconspicuous.
 
Place the valuable gear inside some kind of safe that is also a serverrack. 
 
 Do you know of a product like this? 
 Any other ideas?
 I&#x27;m aware that if someone really wants to steal my gear, they will probably succeed. I just want to make it difficult enough for thieves to be discouraged or complicated enough to allow some time for security to respond to the alarm.
 Thanks

                              <span>I work in OEM pre-sales, so I don&#x27;t have to deal with this shit directly as a customer, but we do partner with the various American service providers who resell our solutions and wrap managed services around it. 
 I&#x27;ve with providers in the past (as a customer), and I&#x27;ve alsoworked in pre-sales for a provider (Verizon), and from my experience,.. all of them are terrible... I can&#x27;t avoid working with them, sadly, but if I have partner with one of them, I&#x27;d rather it it be the one who is least terrible.
 So, when it comes to AT&amp;T, Verizon, Lumen, Specturm, and all the others, which one sucks the least? 
 My Impressions so far:
  
Verizon is horrdendous unless you&#x27;re talking wireless-only.
 AT&amp;T managed services are &quot;ok&quot;, their systems are shit, their baseline circuit support is bad, but they have a good CSM &amp; sales organization that helps alleviate the pain.
 Lumen - Never worked with them, I&#x27;ve heard a lot of bad shit, especially post-Level 3 merger... no clue where they stand these days. Seems like their managed services are bad but their circuits might be ok?
 Spectrum - Good circuits, no clue about the rest.
  
(Note: What I really care about is their ability to deliver enterprise-grade DIA circuits, as well as managed network &amp; security services. Broadband is important too, but from what I&#x27;ve seen, it&#x27;s something that varies significantly best on the location... and they&#x27;re all about the same.)

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been banging my dead about this all evening. I have Metalogix Archive Manager and I need to move to a new file server. Archive manager takes the original file, moves it to cheaper storage, then leave a stub in its place. 
 I need to move the stubs without recalling the original file, but every method I have tried with Robocopy won&#x27;t just copy the stub. I can&#x27;t recall all the files to move them because I don&#x27;t have enough room on my Pure SAN. I have also tried stopping the Archive manager services, but robocopy just throws access errors and copies over a 0k corrupted file.
 Is there a way to do this with Robocopy or better method?

                              <span>I&#x27;m in the process of migrating 100TB share to our new storage (Isilon A200). The LUNS are currently configured as one big LUN inside of VMware as 1 DS. I&#x27;d like to break this up to reduce data loss in the event we have failures and also to simplify our backups (VEEAM).
 Looking for advice on how I should separate this at the SAN level / VMware / Microsoft level ?
 My initial thoughts are:
  
10 x 10 TB LUNS
 10 x 10 TB DataStores VMF6 (I don&#x27;t think vvols add any value but maybe I&#x27;m wrong ?) 
 Leverage Storage Spaces on Wiindows to consolidate the disks into one virtual disk ?
 Separate the data into separate basic disks and use DFS-N to present the share as a unified share ?
 
  
I have no experience with Storage Spaces but am quite familiar with LVM on linux so shouldn&#x27;t be an issue. DFS I have a good handle on.
 Thanks!

                              <span>It’s been years since I’ve been involved with imaging disks. I might’ve used a boot up disk called “Norton” (not the antivirus) ~15 years ago to create images of disks and to restore them to other computers of matching hardware.
 It’s been so long that I’ve been out of the disk managing game and doing a quick google search really either steers me down using Windows tools (doesn’t seem to work) or paid third party tools (can’t find anything boot up like I used before)
 What would you recommend for disk cloning/managing?

                              <span>Seriously, this shit is just so ridiculous. The job postings that don&#x27;t make any sense. Clueless supervisors. Pointless meetings. Insultingly low wages. I&#x27;m done. I&#x27;d rather do just about anything than work in this field any longer.
 And to anyone that says something akin to &quot;don&#x27;t let the door hit you on the way out&quot;. I&#x27;ll miss you the least.

                              <span>None of the icloud accounts appear to be valid. All messages are sus, with sus attachments. They&#x27;re all coming from similar ip ranges in Cupertino, CA, which appears to be just some apple address:
 17.57.156.15
 17.57.156.17
 17.58.63.173
 17.58.63.166
 17.57.156.23
 17.57.156.23
 17.58.63.180
 17.58.38.40
 17.58.63.174
 17.58.38.41
 17.58.38.58
 17.58.38.53
 17.58.38.49
 I am one guy doing pro-bono monitoring of a 5 person business with cloud O365 services. Is this worth blocking the ip ranges here? Any better way to do this since apparently all icloud emails will have similar IPs?

 Have you worked for a company that&#x27;s implemented it? Have you had to implement it yourself because management has told you to? How do you feel about it? What do you make of the potential for abuse?
 My opinion is simply: no. But, would love to hear what you guys think. And yes, there are regulations to deter it that are looking to be enforced more.

                              <span>Like nearly all security practices, this comes down risk assessment, but I think it&#x27;s important to understand.
 The issue: password managers allow you to store things like TOTP (time-based) tokens in them. This is very convenient since you don&#x27;t need to dig up a phone to log in, it can be auto-filled, and easily backed up. However, this is significantly degrading the security of having the second factor in the first place.
 Why it matters: multi-factor authentication is predicated on distributing security into multiple areas, so an account compromise requires significantly more effort. Typically, factors are &quot;something you know&quot; (e.g. a password), &quot;something you have&quot; (e.g. a phone or hardware token), and &quot;something you are&quot; (e.g. a fingerprint or other biometrics).

                              <span>Hello there fellow sysAdmins! Long time lurker here...
 I&#x27;m working on a moving project, we&#x27;ve rented a rack in a DC and want to move our whole infra there and I&#x27;d like to get rid of our tape library... I know they are immutable and great but I hate them and being the only guy that has to remember to buy, replace, store, and tag all the tapes is starting to suck.
 I&#x27;ve eyed this HPE storeOnce solution, we use Veeam for our backups, and the hypervisor is hyper-v (corporate decision) backups are running ok with a 3-2-1 approach, but as I said, being storeOnce with Catalyst kinda immutable I wanted to get feedback about this in order to hopefully switch to that instead of tapes. 
 My main questions are:
 - is the deduplication that good? I&#x27;ve read about a 20:1 ratio (for storage planning)
 - has the catalyst technology ever created issues in your environment? Have you replaced other immutable backup means like tapes with that? 
 Thank you!

                              <span>Does productivity software, not built into windows, leave breadcrumbs in someone&#x27;s home network? Meaning, all that data is getting logged and presumably sent back to a cloud service. For arguments sake, let&#x27;s say it is an AWS cloud server. Wouldn&#x27;t it be possible for someone in a home network running a DNS server such as pi-hole, to identify that traffic and block it? 
 Microsoft would likely be too difficult to tease out because MS sends all sorts of traffic back and forth. Has anyone seen a list of popular software and associated URLs to block? 
 There is no VPN or VDI in place.

                              <span>Hey Sysadmins,
 Can anyone recommend an alternative to Rackspace for IMAP email? 
 Ideally we&#x27;re looking for:
 &lt;$1 per mailbox
 White Label Webmail
 API for add/delete Mailboxes
 Robust &amp; reliable service!
 Rackspace used to be an outstanding company with brilliant people, excellent support, and great products. Sadly they&#x27;ve gone downhill massively in the last 5 years. 
 We&#x27;ve had lots of problems similar to these posted yesterday:

                              <span>Hey fellow sysadmins I wanted to ask a question and just to get a perspective from your experience.
 I hear a few people mainly in IT talk about how horrible their experience was while employed by an MSP provider. Does anyone have anything good to say about an MSP? Are they really that horrible? Just wonder if it really depends on WHO the MSP provider is. Just wanting to see the different responses thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;ll cut straight to the question... I am looking for an agent-based patch management system (I&#x27;ve had better luck with agent-based software in the past). Anything you all recommend?
 We tried Automox, but there were some things that kind of concerned me about its integration with Rapid7.
 Thanks.

                              <span>I work at an MSP and they have a system for organizing AD, but wondered if there were any better/different ideas.
 Specifically regarding user OUs
 We have an AD Users OU with 7 standard sub OUs
 Active Users
 Admin Accounts
 Contacts
 Disabled Users
 Groups (Security and Distro subs)
 Service Accounts
 Shared Accounts
 Sub OUs as necessary of course, just asking about the top-level organization. These companies are mostly one location and less than 75 employees
 Thanks!

Now I&#x27;d like to be more selective. I&#x27;ve noticed that certain industries have inherent IT issues that are hard to deal with. For example, healthcare is tough (if you know, you know). Obviously, there are great employers in bad industries, but those are the exceptions.
 So, what are the good industries to be in for IT?

                              <span>Hi guys, a newbie here, trying to learn.
 I bought a machine for my home lab - Dell PowerEdge T40 with 16GB of it and installed Windows Server Standard Evaluation.
 I installed Hyper-V and installed two VMs, without assigning dynamic memory.
 Now in task manager of my host it says that I have 2.2GB available.
 I tried installing another VM with 1GB of RAM but I couldn&#x27;t because of this error: Not enough memory in the system to start virtual machine
 Why? I really don&#x27;t understand...

                              <span>I am thinking of running the free 100 sensor version of PRTG so my question to those who use it what devices do you keep on your PRTG and what devices do you exclude on your PRTG? 
 So do you keep your network gear and exclude your workstations and printers, etc? 
 Thanks

 I know this sounds stupid, but we are about to undergo our first internal pen test and I&#x27;m scared lol
 I am the sole admin for a SMB and wear all the hats. We&#x27;ve grown quite a bit over the last couple of years and are now up to a little over 150 people in our org. I totally understand ultimately this is a good thing to do, but I&#x27;m worried as soon as I plug in the box they are sending us we&#x27;ll get pwned super easily and I&#x27;m going to look like an idiot in front of my boss and management. Stupid I know.
 Anyway, I was wondering if anyone had any advice on things to double check that we definitely want to make sure we have locked down before we start. I&#x27;ve been making a list and a lot of this stuff I had already implemented a while ago, but it was good to confi…</span>

 We share two servers with a single user account among ourself for work. So having a way to figure out if someone else already has a active session to a machine will be great.
 I already tried using &quot;qwinsta /server:serverIP&quot; and &quot;query session /server:serverIP&quot;. But both of these just return &quot;No session exists for *&quot;. I tried googling more but haven&#x27;t found anything solid. Also tried using &quot;psloggedon \serverIP&quot;, this returns a list of users which includes the one we all use commonly. But every user has . This doesn&#x27;t change even if I am connected to the machine or not. So not much of an help. If you guys know how to fix this or a workaround, it would be great.

                              <span>Guys
 I work for a number of clients where we have used App-V as the primary packaging toolset for both traditional desktops and virtual clients hosted on tools such as Citrix and VMware. 
 With the support for App-V now gone and Microsoft&#x27;s push towards MSIX I wondered what people&#x27;s thoughts and experience around this is. 
 I did work on a client where we started using MSIX initially but found the feature set compared to App-V to be limited with an anticpitation that this would improve over time. 
 I&#x27;ve read the MSIX report cards that Tim Mangan does and see that the success ratio without additional tools such as PSF has a hit rate of 31% for MSIX compared to 90% for App-V.
 We are approaching a junction point in our application management stack and thinking of dropping Application Virtualisation in favour of using toolsets such as Winget and / or PSADT to wrap vendors installers. 
 Let me know what your thoughts are on this.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi guys, a 25+ year old newbie here trying to learn everything I can about Windows servers, AD, Hyper V etc.
 Basically I bought a machine for my home lab - Dell PowerEdge T40, with 16GB of RAM.
 I installed Win22 server on it, installed Hyper-V and a DC in that Hyper-V with 8GB of RAM.
 I wanted to create Windows Standard Core, and allocated 4GB of RAM but I got a message that says &quot;Not enough memory in the system to start virtual machine&quot;.
 Now I thought since I have 16GB of RAM, a virtual machine with 8GB and another one with 4GB will run just fine.
 I allocated less RAM to my first machine, from 8GB to 4GB, and because it wouldn&#x27;t install I tried again, allocating 2GB of RAM and it worked. I don&#x27;t understand why it wouldn&#x27;t let me use 4GB.
 ​
 Ammount of RAM on host - 16GB
 VM1 - 4GB
 VM2 - 2GB
 Host uses - 5GB
 So I have available 5GB of RAM.
 That being said, I don&#x27;t understand why I couldn&#x27;t allocate 2GB more to VM2.
 ​
 I know there is some allocation rule in HyperV I just can&#x27;t find it, or I did and I still don&#x27;t get it.
 How to calculate how many machines can I install and run with X ammount of RAM?

But we still have a few customers that use older devices with a proprietary connector. I dont want to keep all of those different types of spares anymore, so i would like to order a few universal chargers that i can give the customer while they wait on their new charger.Do you guys have any suggestions or better solustions?Basically im looking for a charger with multiple adapters to fit different brands and ideally usb-c. 120-150watts would be ideal.

 Essentially, full audit of your O365 environment, literally everything from how users are set up to how different teams/share points are being used and privacy/sharing, to emails and domains, along with all security of physical networks and cloud environments, and assessment of end point/asset management. 
 This provider we hire would literally scour through EVERYTHING your company uses and touches … database/email/major applications/ banking credentials as well as the physical infrastructure and asset management and gives you the full good, bad, ugly on what is wrong security wise as well as inefficient structure or procedures to also show what can be done to automate and streamline management. And ideally this same company sells the services to execute too or there are recommendations on companies they take the results and offer services to fix and execute.
 Backstory: Recently joined a company as an executive and realize that its entire environment has been thrown together by a couple inexperienced IT support employees. No fault of their own, the company started mom and pop small business and rapidly exploded into a national player and these guys just kept the lights on. There is no asset management, no end point management, no understanding of how to streamline/control data, (literally zero governance), etc. To better know what we don’t know so we can add the right people to the existing team, we are hoping to pay lots of $$$$ to have a trusted company contracted to “fix” us up so we can take it from there.

I&#x27;m just wondering what&#x27;s the best way to go here and could really use some different opinions. What would be the impact if I just deleted all the policies and created new one&#x27;s?
 I should also mention that they don&#x27;t even have half of their current devices enrolled in Intune, so ya...
 Anyway, thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi ,
 We already have a local admin , it is created when we install windows on the pc . Name local admin example : &quot;admin&quot; . We have laps installed but we want create another local admin because laps doesn&#x27;t work good all the time . Second local admin : &quot;admin2&quot;
 We don&#x27;t want create from domain !!
 Soo , i create a user admin2 and a group Local Admins . At user i add in Administrator group and in Local Admins add at membres admin2
 Then i create a gpo : Edit -&gt;Computer Configuration -&gt; Windows Settings -&gt; Security Settings -&gt; Restricted Groups -&gt; add group and then i add Local admin
 After in &quot;this group is a member of&quot; i add Administrator
 I went to the PC I&#x27;m testing cmd -&gt; gpupdate /force
 I checked from cmd -&gt; compmgmt.msc -&gt; Local Users and Groups -&gt; Groups -&gt; Administrator and GPO works ok is apply . See the &quot;AD\Local Admins&quot;
 it is not possible to see only the name? Idk group name &quot;Local Adminis&quot; or only &quot;admin&quot; without &quot;AD\...&quot;
 Run with administrator write admin2 and password again working
 But I don&#x27;t understand if at the moment the user is from the domain or is local .The question is if the user applies from the domain or is it local ? if it&#x27;s local, how can i do it, there is another way?

                              <span>Evening Everyone,
 Just a quick query if someone could help. We’re currently moving our AD Connect to Server 2019. The server is in staging mode at the moment. 
 I noticed the first two initial Full Imports showed as:
 Adds: 997
 Updates: 327
 The subsequent delta syncs are OK. Before I move this out of staging mode, is there any concern? 
 these are the steps I followed: https://www.alitajran.com/migrate-azure-ad-connect/ 
 Cheers,

                              <span>Hello. I&#x27;m new here. In short: there is a standalone server with Windows Hyper-V Server 17763. There is a VM with Veeam Backup&amp;Replication, a VM with Windows Server 2019 (Active Directory), a VM with Windows 10, and a VM with Ubuntu (Samba). All machines in the test domain. I need to backup Windows Server 2019, windows 10 and ubuntu to a shared Samba folder. Ubuntu backed up without errors, but two VMs with Windows Server and Windows 10 back up with errors. Error example (from Edit Job-&gt;Guest Processing-&gt;Test Now):
 \green tick* Connecting to guest OS via RPC*
 \green tick* Testing admin$ share accessibility via RPC*
 \green tick* Testing guest OS connectivity via RPC*
 \red cross* Connecting to guest OS via PowerShell Direct*
 \red cross* Testing admin$ share accessibility via PowerShell Direct*
 \red cross* Cannot connect to VM*
 \green tick* Credentials and connectivity have been validated successfully for RPC transport* 
 What i tried:
  
From VMs (on Windows) the folder (\\NAME\admin$) opens normally with the data that i specified. I have tried turning this feature (Enable application-aware processing) on and off in the settings, the result is the same. 
  
This error is in the report:
 1) Failed to create VM recovery checkpoint (mode:Crash consistent)
 2) Failed to create VM recovery checkpoint (mode: Hyper-V child partition snapshot)
  
I tried using powershell to enable vss (vmicvss, vmicvmsession) settings on Windows VMs, it had no effect on the result.
 Changed checkpoint type from production to production-only in settings Hyper-V.
 Checkpoints from the hyper-v manager and from the hypervisor&#x27;s powershell are created fine.
  
if any additional information is needed, please let me know. Thanks to all.

                              <span>Hello
 i&#x27;m looking for a smartphone app for innovaphone IP811 on-premise. smartphones are 90% android, 10% apple, but apple not that important
 Mypbx-app 12r2 sr59 can be used to outgoing calls using company office personal number, and can be used for inconing calls using company office personal number mostly without call-forwarding
 any form of cloud is completely disallowed, my boss will ask if i&#x27;m sick if I recommend something cloudy.
 missing features are:
 a) boss seems to miss a list of incoming calls on his smartphone, he does not want to keep his boss waiting. 
 b) group calls do not work reliable, meaning five persons are assigned call group 70, all phones should ring when that number is dialled.
 what are options here?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi. We are a small organization with ~30 employees and planning to signup for Microsoft 365 Business Standard. Our plan is to take the 30 day trial and test out the product before moving to a paid annual plan. Our main requirement is email, video calling with external clients &amp; document storage.
 As an IT admin, what are some of the aspects you look for when you are evaluating a product like Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace? What factors make you convinced to move to a paid plan?

                              <span>We recently migrated our last server to Azure. This was our file server which only served as file storage. Devices in the network would connect to the shares via a network drive. Mapped drives are setup with group policy. 
 We are connecting to Azure by a site to site vpn. Onsite are redundant Meraki MX250&#x27;s and we have a meraki vMX in Azure. We have redundant 1Gb up/down fiber connections.
 File server VM specs: D2ds_v5 &#x3D; 2cpu, 8GB RAM. Standard SSD&#x27;s
 If I open a network drive on my computer and copy 30MB of files in one folder and paste them to another folder in the same network drive, transfer takes around 3+min. If I remote into the file server VM and do the same file copy and transfer locally it takes 2 seconds. I assumed file transfers would be a little slower since it is no longer onsite but this is much slower than it should be. It almost feels like Azure is throttling the read/writes or throughput. Anyone have any experience with this?

I don&#x27;t understand this practice whatsoever, and I&#x27;m having a hard time wrapping my head around any possible use for it. More symbols &#x3D; more entropy &#x3D; incrementally better passwords, no? 
 Sorry in advance if this isn&#x27;t sysadmin-y enough. Surprisingly enough, couldn&#x27;t find any specific ITSec-related subs on short notice.

                              <span>Hey everyone, long story short, I&#x27;ve written a wallpaper powershell that changes the wallpaper for a department every month, but allows the wallpaper to still be changed. Basically if you want a custom wallpaper, you have to change it every month. It is what it is, no enforcement on that.
 ​
 Onto the question, I have everything scripted out with powershell basically checking the date, and if the date passes the 1st, it will run a script that changes registry to give a new wallpaper. The wallpapers are different every month.

 I&#x27;m basically at the final step, everything works locally on my machine, however I&#x27;m having an issue and can&#x27;t figure it out logically what to do next. The Scheduled task I run locally has it &#x27;Run whether user is logged on or not&quot; and it&#x27;s set to not store password…</span>

                              <span>On Jan 24th - a spoofed email showed up in the front business office, saying:
 &quot;Hello Business manager,
 I hope you&#x27;re having a good day. I recently switched banks and require your assistance in updating my new account information for direct deposits. Please specify what information should be included for upcoming payments.
 Regards,
 Employee #1&quot;
 The business manager knew this was fake, because the person was at work 2 feet away from her on Jan 24th.
 The very next morning on Jan 25th Employee #2 comes to me (jr admin here) saying that employee #1 was logged into Employee #2&#x27;s computer...this is highly unlikely (employee #1 does not work on this floor and she barely knows how to log into her OWN computer) and would be considered out of line in this job. 
 It was showing E#1 logged in on …</span>

                              <span>Hello All! 
 I’ve got 2x DL360 Gen10 2019 “standard”servers. Both setup as RAID 10. Server1 is setup as a Hyper-V server hosting 4 vms (2016 servers) and roughly 15 TBs of data including an sql server that is the bulk of the data. 
 Server2 is identical to Server1; processor, ram, partitions,etc. This is a fresh server, only Hyper V installed. I have not moved/copied over any vms or data data, just installed a the same roles and applied some updates. Figured over a weekend I’d save off the VMs and import them into server2 and robocopy daily to sync data. Would this work? 
 My mission is to figure out a way to have the “in production” server1 in building A sync or mirror to server2 in building B (fiber). In the event of a disaster I’d be able to move server2 into production and keep folks working. Servers are on the same domain, network, vlan and can see one another. 
 Is it possible to set server1 up to regularly sync everything including vms and their data to server2 in real-time or hourly/bi-hourly intervals using robocopy? I’m okay with daily, but hourly would be better. MS best practices? Not opposed to 3rd party software, but would prefer a free Microsoft option if available (limited resources). 
 Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance! 
 Tldr, sync 2 identical 2019 standard servers with 4 hyper vms for disaster recovery using robocopy to sync data regularly.

 I did enjoy how he changed the VPN shortcut as well, even though it&#x27;s synced to his Windows account.
 Feel free to share some stories about poor password management you&#x27;ve encountered.

                              <span>So I am looking for what limitations are put on users (including yourself) at your company. The last company I worked for had the limit at 50GB and the company I recently joined has a limit of 500MB. I admit I am not the best at managing my inbox but I feel like every week I am constantly fighting to delete or archive to keep it under the limit. Is there a rational reason why it is SO low? Also feel free to throw the limit from the company you work at if you want.

Very little specifics on what they are aiming for or why and they also already are set up with a hybrid environment syncing AD to Azure with Azure AD Connect. The thought is they just don&#x27;t want to be reliant on local resources; needing to be internal either on site or VPN to access shares for example. 
 What are some of the scenarios you guys have run into that worked well to satisfy the hunger to go cloud, even though they don&#x27;t entirely understand what it means.
 Printing, file shares/access, account/device management, security, etc.

Where to now? I used Goto for nearly two decades - I loved their three strikes and locked out access and domestic (US) base. I despised their pricing structure, but it now may work to my advantage as I&#x27;ve been spending a grand a year for remote access to SIX COMPUTERS! I would think I should be able to stay within that price structure! 
 Who do you trust to secure remote desktop access to your network?

                              <span>A couple of users got fooled by a recent phishing campaign, and one of them had their email compromised for over a day before he noticed. At first I was annoyed, but...
 I was authorized to enable MFA everywhere that it makes sense. We rolled it out for M365 this afternoon and management now has zero sympathy for the few users who complain about it.
 I just finished a meeting with my manager where we reviewed the questionnaire from our cyber insurance provider. He seems willing to spend time and money on the security controls that we&#x27;re currently missing. I&#x27;ve brought up every one of these in the past, but where before he would say &quot;Too expensive,&quot; now his comments are, &quot;That seems reasonable,&quot; and &quot;Our contracts require us to carry cyber insurance, so we should implement this.&quot;
 I am going to be busy, but I am so happy.
 Did any else suddenly get full go-ahead to implement security controls after their cyber insurance provider made it the obvious choice?

                              <span>I HATE marketing bullshit. Companies that come along and pitch their software but make wild claims that are clearly bollocks. One such company was Dark Trace. Our manager let them present but I said I hated the smarmy sales pitch (this was a while ago now so can&#x27;t remember it, only that it was smarmy, misleading bollocks). We decided against them and I&#x27;m glad I was proven right.
 https://www.theguardian.com/business/2023/jan/31/uk-cybersecurity-firm-darktrace-shares-short-sellers
 On the other had we have a little known e-mail filter called Libra that was created by engineers that used to use filters so knew what they wanted and needed and pitched by those engineers that use it. Was a much better presentation and we liked it.
 We&#x27;re glad we have a manager that not only listens to us but also hates smarmy sales bollocks :)

All the machines are sitting there unable to start, so customer can&#x27;t log in to work, on day 1 of the go-live I spent 1 1/2 months building trust for. Talk about terrible timing.

 Should be easy, right? Nope, they have removed the ability to do that themselves, even if their Support Site says otherwise.
 https://i.imgur.com/ReTAQFH.png 
 So just a heads up to others planning on canceling: You have to fill out their Contact Form on https://support.lastpass.com/contactm and they will then call you (and try to convince you, not to cancel).
 To their credit, I got a call within 15 minutes.
 I hope I have saved others the time i wasted, trying to cancel on their Website.
 Companies that removes the possibility to cancel subscriptions online, can go fuck themselves.

 I have been looking for any conclusion on Online Archive on a sharedmailbox in OWA, however I can&#x27;t find any information about it.
 Problem:
 When users are working in the Outlook web, they can only see their personal online archive. When adding a shared mailbox to this user it doesn&#x27;t add the Online Archive of this shared mailbox.

                              <span>Network guy here. I&#x27;m experimenting in a lab environment to test the feasibility of a DR strategy and a &quot;make it or break it&quot; caveat that I ran into is that I can&#x27;t seem to find a way to tell windows to source requests that it initiates FROM the loopback adapter IP.
 Sure, it can listen on the loopback, and take in requests from it... but when I initiate a request FROM the server, it uses the NIC&#x27;s IP address, which makes sense.. however I want to configure it to source all of these requests from the loopback adapter if possible, routing through the NIC.
 ​
 Example:
 NIC: 10.0.0.100/24 
 Loopback: 172.18.1.100/32
 If I am RDP&#x27;d into the server and go to https://www.google.com/, then run a &quot;netstat -an | findstr 443&quot;, I will see this:
 10.0.0.100:52143 142.251.40.196:443 ESTABLISHED
 Where I&#x27;d like for it to look like this:
 172.18.1.100:52143 142.251.40.196:443 ESTABLISHED
 ​
 Does anyone know if this is possible?

                              <span>Hello Fellow Nerds, 
 I&#x27;m in search of a rough or direct equivalent to the watchdog daemon on Linux systems. 
 One Windows-based server I manage has an app that needs to run 24/7 basically, and it will typically lock up after a week or so, requiring us to remote into said server to restart the app. Not too big of a deal, takes a few mins. 
 I&#x27;m attempting to automate some such tasks in our org and I&#x27;m familiar with watchdog on Linux systems and was wondering if anyone knew of an equivalent service for Windows-based server platforms. Something that would simply ping the app or service every X minutes/hours and kill/relaunch the app if it doesn&#x27;t respond, or if it&#x27;s hung, etc. 
 My Google-fu is normally incredibly strong, but I&#x27;m not finding much for this one. 
 Any help would be appreciated. Thanks for your time gents and ladies.

The answer was yes, thank you! So I created policies -- otherwise I would have had to review and release all that junk myself. Now three weeks later, Microsoft has fixed that -- you can use the strict presets and enable user notification and release.

                              <span>Google SMTP - now, IMHO, the world&#x27;s biggest spammer - completely ignores hard bounces from my server and keeps resending the bounced email nonstop as if it were a soft bounce. My logs are filled with Google ignoring the 550 5.7.1 code and resending the hard bounced email for 3 days; has anyone had any success at getting Google to respect hard bounces and not resend them?
 By contrast, Microsoft totally respects them as in when my server hard bounces spam from outlook.com, I never receive it again. Since the drastic bulk of my spam comes from Google&#x27;s servers, either from Gmail or the Google SMTP or Google API send, if someone has found a way to hard bounce Google successfully, please feel free to share, thanks.
 My logs are filled with the following; Google is clearly resending on a schedule where it tries to deliver the hard bounced email for 3 days at increasing intervals - so I end up getting maybe 20 of these exact same Google retries - until it gives up whereas it should be giving up the moment it receives the 550:

                              <span>Hey, just a quick ramble and I am curious how others see this scenario since it is a very common one. We have about 1000 users in our environment, everyone works from home 3 days per week. The users connect to a VPN from home, just like almost every other company.
 We&#x27;ve had MFA rolled out for a long time with SMS authentication, but recently one of the C-suites was targeted in a SIM swap. We&#x27;re now switching over to an authenticator-based solution which requires users to have an authenticator app on their phones. It has been going well, but we have a small handful of users (about 10) who are adamantly against using their phones for anything work-related. These users all have smartphones, so there is no technical limitation stopping them from being able to install the authenticator app.
 My ideology is that phones, like internet at home, or like transportation to and from work, are all things that an employee are expected to have. Everyone already understands that they can connect to their own home Wifi to then access our VPN and connect to our corporate network, and that is taking some bandwidth from their other devices. I&#x27;m not really seeing the difference between those two use cases as we aren&#x27;t monitoring their phones, or adding any MDM solution to them. They could feel that way but I&#x27;d expect them to already feel that way by connecting a corporate laptop to their home network.
 I know most companies provide cell phones or stipends to employees for phone services if they are expected to use their phones for work purposes but no employee is expected to do anything besides receive a 6-digit code to authenticate when logging in to our systems.
 Management requested us to just set up a group for users who refuse to just leave their policy to only require SMS authentication.

                              <span>Admin by request has been so smooth thus far in removing admin rights for people who don’t need it. I almost jumped and said yea. Most users don’t realise their admin rights are gone (because they rarely ever use them) the hardest part was letting them know they need to request admin rights and enter their email when they do so.
 Now it’s so smooth my anxiety of “what if” temporarily died ISN’T THAT AMAZING. If anyone has anything to suggest which also works well feel free to post. I won’t be using it but it may be better for some else.
 Did I mention their break glass, the integration with AAD. You can deploy it with Intune.

 If anyone has been laid off remember that your skills are still a global shortage and there is still jobs out their for you

 I configured MutualAuth and Integrity. I checked the registry on the client machine to verify the paths are there. Outside of checking the registry, is there a way to verify that MutualAuth and Integrity are indeed being enforced now on those shared folders?
 Clients are Windows 10 Pro and servers are 2012 R2.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello,
 I am wondering what is called user when buying CAL licenses. I couldn&#x27;t find answers which are not ambiguous.
 Is it a physical user ? Or an active directory user ?
 For example, we have 5 physical users, they all have their own computer with their own users but there is a 6th computer being a 6th user in active directory but only the 5 same physical users have a use on it. 
 Do we need 5 or 6 in that case ?
 Thanks !

I know a bgp session using my ASN would make things simple, but my provider charges 100/month for this so its a non-starter as the byoip service is free. My question now is how do I get the rest of my ipv4 block (.2 - .254) over to my home via ipsec?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve run a mailserver IP check on my Google Workspace (paid) sending IP using https://multirbl.valli.org/
 My outgoing IP appears on 24 blacklists including 0spam, Ascams, SORBS, Backscatterer, etc.
 The TXT descriptions of some of these lists show clearly that my IP is on there because other users of my IP have misbehaved. There are subject lines of emails in the last two weeks like &quot;Manpower from Pakistan&quot;, &quot;Our Loan Products&quot;, etc., as well as send dates (anywhere between 2013 and 2023) which have absolutely nothing to do with me.
 I have DMARC, DKIM and SPF all correctly set up.
 Yet, my emails sometimes does not get through to certain recipients so I&#x27;m sure there are deliverability issues.
 Is it normal that a PAID email provider like Google Workspace will be sending your emails through a dirty IP?
 Another thread suggests setting up an outgoing proxy Amazon SES IP. I&#x27;m technical enough to do this, but is it worth it? How do I know that it won&#x27;t be polluted as well?
 Any other solutions appreciated.

                              <span>So we now have SentinelOne. Its supposed to be good but its behaviour engine is becoming increasingly annoying.
 Lets take Process Explorer as an example. Its a well know Microsoft app, yet Sentinel doesn&#x27;t like its PROCEXP152.SYS file. Its a &quot;SignedKnownAndVerified&quot;, it knows it came from procexp64.exe, I have put an exclusion in
 c:\Windows\System32\drivers\PROCEXP152.SYS
 Yet it ignores this and flags it as malicious every time.
 It claims the file is loading here:
 \Device\HarddiskVolume4\Windows\System32\drivers\PROCEXP152.SYS
 So we put in 
 \Device\HarddiskVolume*\Windows\System32\drivers\PROCEXP152.SYS
 A star wildcard. But makes no difference. Flagging it in the console as a false positive appears to do nothing to stop it flagging it again.
 Anyone else had issues with SentinelOne&#x27;s behaviour engine?

                              <span>Hi All, I&#x27;m based in the UK and have an interview for an IT officer role tomorrow. I was looking for some advice as to how best to impress.
 The role is for an IT officer, so not quite sysadmin, but it&#x27;s basically a frontline role, troubleshooting peoples issues, helping with their workflows and teaching groups how to use relevant software. 
 A bit of background on me. I have no formal IT qualifications, but I love technology and I have spent a lot of my career helping people out with their tech and workflows, having had friends in the IT department at a previous job who taught me a lot. I spend a lot of my personal time learning things. I&#x27;ve learned HTML, CSS and Javascript, Adobe Cloud and I&#x27;m good with office and Excel and I can easily pick up new software. I know that I&#x27;m more than capable of the role. 
 I would really like to get this job, given a complicated personal life with my wife&#x27;s health, the role is ideal for a good work life balance. Can anyone give me any insight into what they will be looking for and how I can best impress. 
 Appreciate any and all help. 
 Thanks.

                              <span>I wish i had system rights so i can make my work easier, im what you would call L1 helpdesk and when it comes to user accounts, passwords, system changes, rights etc its done by the sysadmin but i do the setups, onboarding users or basically implementation. Now the crazy part is we can have some users or a whole department chasing the &quot;IT department&quot; via helpdesk without knowing who they really dealing with or who is handling their case with no progress in sight because the sysadmin is sitting on the tickets or moving at snail&#x27;s pace
 now i dont know how this sysadmin knows that hell is about to break loose because 5 minutes to having some tampers flare or managers being involved about the delay, he will quickly create the accounts or do the required system changes then dumps the information to me, and as soon as an alarm is raised he will divert all the anger towards me saying he is working on your issue or he has the details you need or he is the one supposed to do xyz -which would be technically true but i couldnt have done it for the past 10 days because i was waiting for the sysadmin to make system changes
 now im looking like im stupid, slow or without a sense of urgence yet he was the one sitting on the tickets for a whole week, and i now have a tonne load of things to do in small amount of time on top of what i already have to do

                              <span>New day, new rant.
 Starting yesterday, we officially stopped supporting any HP printer (except high end enterprise printers). A few months back it was only the printers with an &quot;e&quot; in the model name. Now it&#x27;s everyone of them.
 Why?
 Because installing a printer used to be very simple:
  
do a dhcp reservation
 connect the printer
 install drivers
 (optionally) deploy it with policies
 ​
 (solve the tons of problems any printer had since the 90&#x27;s)
  
​
 for years, it took 10 minutes to unpack and mount and 10 minutes of software/drivers installation etc....
 ​
 Now, unpack the printer still takes 20 minutes (top).
 Working with small offices and small (20-400 people) companies that actually use low-to-mid-range printers, installing them on clients has now become a nightmare.
 You have to use that f***ing &quot;HP SMART&quot; application, downloaded from windows store. It&#x27;s impossible to do that on servers, you have to use a customer&#x27;s pc. And don&#x27;t even try to connect a USB cable before completing the in-app procedure!
 Then half of those printers... they just doesn&#x27;t work.
 A few of them doesn&#x27;t connect to their &quot;HP Web Services&quot;, the majority are stuck with a &quot;complete the configuration...&quot; message. Resetting, reinstalling application, jumping on a single foot, running a marathon, get a new cable, cutting the cable, using it as a whip...
 Nothing works. Returning and replacing it with any other brand is just easier and way faster.

                              <span>Hello Everyone,
 I&#x27;ve also posted this on homenetworking, but hoping I could also get some input here
 Hoping I could get some advise here. I&#x27;ve recently bought a house that is yet to be build. The expected delivery date of the house is Q2 of 2024.
 The house is a project build and during the build we have option. One of the option is the placement of ethernet connection. You might be thinking, why not do this yourself? Well unlike traditional house building where there is an &quot;empty pipe&quot; in the wall to pull your own cable. This construction will not have this. The cables will directly be pulled in the wall during the build of the house. I&#x27;m not allowed to do anything while the house is being build until I get my keys. By then hopefully all the walls are in place.
 Here is where I need you…</span>

 As a fairly new sysadmin in their late 20s, which path would you recommend?

 My current job title (Systems Administrator) has really just hung around for a while, even though the positions functions have changed quite a bit over the last 5 years.
 Is it a no-no to update it to &quot;Systems Engineer&quot;, at least for the duration of the application process for this new role?

                              <span>Was curious if this existed.
 The idea of having a self-hosted system that, if for some reason had to be taken down, could fall-back to a cloud-version sounds amazing.
 Some obvious caveats would include synchronizing critical file systems and services, but I&#x27;m curious if this has been done before.
  
What made me think of this in the first place is that I&#x27;m hosting my own mail server at home, but the thought of missing mail due to a hardware issue that could last a few days worries me. Would love to host myself, but fall back to something solid during harsh times.

                              <span>I have an Aruba 2930F acting as the core switch for a site with fewer than 10 vlans, we are looking at expanding the L2 network with four daisy chained Cisco 2960X switches. The 2930F is currently MSTP priority 0. Should I set all four 2960X switches to MST with lower priority with the last switch being the lowest (in addition to port-fast on endpoint ports) or is there something else I should pay special attention to being a mixed environment?

                              <span>We&#x27;re a small ISP and I&#x27;m embarrassed to admit we don&#x27;t have a process for creating or documenting our circuit IDs for NNIs, DIAs, or PONs. In my defense I&#x27;m not really part of the infrastructure team and we don&#x27;t have that many circuits right now. 
 The guys want to get better at documenting their work and we obviously need to get away from having all that info out of our lead tech&#x27;s noggin. Most of our documentation is printed on paper and shoved into a file cabinet with the service info. 
 We&#x27;d like to be able to create circuit IDs for all of our paths and document all relevant info for connectors, patch panels, splices, buffer tubes, breakouts, splits, as well as important things like splice reports, OTDR reports, locate notes etc. 
 Could we use a tool like OpenDCIM for this, or is there something else we can deploy to get us started? If you&#x27;ve got any tips or advice to get me started I&#x27;d appreciate it.

                              <span>What happens when you do not license your Catalyst 9K switches with Cisco Smart License? A colleague I work with said he always runs &quot;license boot level network-advantage add-on DNA-advantage&quot; to enable to features he needed i.E HSRP, routing... on the switches but never actually licenses it through the Smart Portal. Are there any future repercussions that can occur on your switches if you fail to license through the Cisco Smart License Portal?

                              <span>This is mainly to vent. I ordered a new batch of Aruba 2530s from CDW in Nov 2021. Since then they&#x27;ve discontinued that model and cdw is giving us whatever the next one up is for no extra charge. Which would be cool, but we still don&#x27;t have them!
 Contemplated going Cisco instead and their lead times are somehow worse.
 Are you all actually buying new hardware somewhere? This is ridiculous.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I have a confusing issue. I have a Win Server 2019 acting as a domain controller (PDC). From this server I am able to successfully ping all clients on the subnet, but I&#x27;m not able to ping the 1st hop Mikrotik Switch (crs326-24g-2s+rm). All other clients (including the server 2019 backup domain controller) can ping the Mikrotik.
 A tracert to the switch from the PDC server shows no connectivity, however the server is reachable from other clients connected to the switch.
 Tracing route to mt [192.168.x.y]
 over a maximum of 30 hops:
 1 * * * Request timed out.
 2 * * * Request timed out.
 3 * * * Request timed out.
 Thus far I have:
  
Rebooted the Mikrotik
 Rebooted the server in question (PDC)
 Changed ethernet cables
 Changed port the PDC is connected to on the Mikrotik to a port that another server 2019 instance was able to successfully ping from
 Tested ping from all other clients on the subnet
 Verified server IP is part of the same subnet as the switch IP.
 Disabled the windows firewall - had no impact
  
The PDC is directly connected to the switch. I&#x27;m able to ping the gateway on the other side of the switch, and am able to ping all clients connected to the switch.
 Network topology is quite simple. All clients connected to the Mikrotik, and a single router upstream connected to the modem.
 Any thoughts on how to re-establish pings from this server? I have a monitoring app that reports uptime from this server (I know...I know...shouldn&#x27;t be on a PDC), and right now it is reporting the switch is down. This started yesterday. Previous to that there were no issues. No changes to the PDC have been made, which makes this even more confusing.
 Thanks everyone,
 Cal.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I just installed a pair of 9800-L-F in HA mode (RMI+RP). RP ports are connected back to back and TE0/1/0 from each WLC are connected to the core switch.
 When I disconnect the f.o. port from the active controller the other one takes control, and that&#x27;s fine. The former active controller, however, have to reboot itself before completing the active to standby transistion (don&#x27;t know why it needs to reboot but that&#x27;s the way Cisco decided...): if I reconnect the fiber cable BEFORE the unit is rebooted, it will completely freeze. No output whatsoever on the console and the box is completely dead until I disconnect and reconnect the power cable.
 Has anyone seen this behaviour?
 Bye, Dario

                              <span>Hi guys, I am getting tired of coming across unauthorised and unsecure devices on our network. I know NAC is the solution but our company is impotent and unable to sort out the management policy side of things to actually implement it. In the meantime I am scanning our network with various tools I have and kicking off devices that break the current policies I am allowed to enforce. Have been using Zenmap on Mac but was wondering if there was a better version or option out there that is free/open source? Perhaps something that can be installed on a server and present scans or reports in a nicer way? We have some other tools that can fingerprint but they mostly rely on DHCP relay to get info so are only useful for DHCP devices and don&#x27;t see stuff on static IPs. Any suggestions of tools welcome. I appreciate this isn&#x27;t cyber security sub but I am a network engineer and looking at ultimately discovering as many of these devices as possible to boot them off until management pulls their fingers out and allows us to implement NAC. Cheers.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for API support on a C9500-16X running IOS-XE 17.6.3, but I have also seen the same issue on v16.6 code and 17.6.4.
 If you have a trunk interface with enough VLAN allowed entries that the cli displays the list as multiple lines with the “add” option e.g.:
  
interface TenGigabitEthernet1/0/1
 switchport trunk native vlan 99
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,4,8,10,30,40,50
 switchport trunk allowed vlan add 202,241,342,400,1101
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport nonegotiate
 end 
  
When I use RESTCONF to interrogate the config with a URL like:https:///restconf/data/Cisco-IOS-XE-native:native/interface/TenGigabitEthernet 
 The results only list the final &#x27;add&#x27; line - and lose the &#x27;switchport trunk allowed vlan&#x27; line:
  // &quot;switchport&quot;: { &quot;Cisco-IOS-XE-switch:mode&quot;: { &quot;trunk&quot;: {} }, &quot;Cisco-IOS-XE-switch:nonegotiate&quot;: [null], &quot;Cisco-IOS-XE-switch:trunk&quot;: { &quot;allowed&quot;: { &quot;vlan&quot;: { &quot;add&quot;: &quot;202,241,342,400,1101&quot; } }, &quot;native&quot;: { &quot;vlan&quot;: { &quot;vlan-id&quot;: 99 } } } } 
 It appears it doesn&#x27;t see the information regarding the config line:
  
switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,4,8,10,30,40,50
  
Am I doing something wrong? Is there another way to get this information or is this a bug?

                              <span>What is your analytics solution of choice to monitor your network?
 ​
 We need to find an analytics solution to monitor our campus network. It is a large campus with 20k+ devices being used at a time. We have Extreme Cloud IQ currently and we are using the wireless and NAC portions of the software. It makes sense to use the Extreme option since we already have other products, but if there is a better solution, I would like to know. I would also like to ask if this would allow us more insight into upstream routing information, as we somewhat regularly have routing issues between our two ISPs (I can add more detail if needed). Incase our basic setup is helpful in forming your answer, our core is Extreme Networks and our firewall is Palo Alto and we have a full 10gb network down to the switches. Our end-user numbers are ~18k and each has ~3 devices.

                              <span>Hey.
 I have been looking at an issue again lately.
 The problem is that flow cache data in IOS XR does not contain src/dst AS, prefix lengths, etc.
 (I.e. all bgp attribute-download attributes)
 This is running netflow on an interface in vrf with mpls label allocation mode &quot;per-ce&quot;.
 As per documentation:
 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/asr9000/software/asr9k-r6-2/netflow/configuration/guide/b-netflow-cg-asr9000-62x/b-netflow-cg-asr9000-62x_chapter_010.html
 ​
  
When the netflow configuration for VPNv4 or VPNv6 is applied in label allocation mode (either per prefix or per CE) then the IPv4 or IPv6 netflow do not capture the BGP attributes such as BGP nh, BGP AS numbers and prefix lengths; these attributes values are set to zero.
  
What is your take on this? I figure there must be someone else with the same architecture requirement who are facing the same limitation, who might have solved or worked around it in a way or another?
 If so, let me know what you did

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m trying to design a small topology for my bachelor&#x27;s degree project and I need to design it in EVE.
 I need to create a PKI, to be more specific a CA that delivers certificates for Fortinet Fortigate firewalls and Cisco Routers that will have IPsec configured on them.
 I am aware of the option to use one router as a CA server, I took that into consideration, but I wonder if I can create a CA on an ubuntu image so all the IPsec peers get their certificate from that server. Does anybody know any solution? Is it even worth it? Or should I just stick to the router option?
 What solution is used in a real-life scenario? I saw some equipment online like Fortinet FortiAuthentifier or something like that.
 Thank you very much! Have a productive week.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working a bit with Kemp Loadmaster recently, and while they&#x27;ve been quite solid at what they do, the management interface sure leaves a bit to be desired... I&#x27;m a bit puzzled by the fact that even though they have a REST API (and also a Powershell API), there&#x27;s almost nothing out there to be found when it comes to scripts, python modules, Ansible modules, etc. I know there is their Kemp360 product but that one seems fairly limited in regards to what you can do with it.
 So for those of you that have larger deployments (i.e. more than one cluster...), how do you manage them? Custom scripts? Point and click in web interface? Anything else?

 I&#x27;m looking for a method to authenticate CE router and delegate IPv6 prefix. I find the method with ppp, but I&#x27;m looking for a more &quot;modern&quot; solution. How the service provider uses the delegation of IPv6 prefix nowadays ? This is still in use ? how they perform authentication ?
 Thanks for your reply,
 This is for educational purposes.

                              <span>Hey yall, I have been tasked with building suitable a network that mimics the ones used in urban areas. 
 What do I mean?
 So in my country they are using networks made specifically for densely populated areas for remote areas causing speed and performance drop in connection in rural areas. It involved redundant transmission routes. However, it focused on high commercial areas or the major residential areas of certain parishes. Where the return on investment was almost guaranteed, low geographic challenges and high value customers.
 Is there a topology/strategy I could implement that could work on a community level that would see a consistent network performance similar to urban areas that would be cost effective/not expensive to implement by a developing country that will positively affect low income/non-high value customers? 
 Also what simulation software I can use to test this infrastructure and how it performs to a different situations like high device count so we can narrow down a best possible infrastructure for a remote community?

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve noticed that with my company firewall, there are some web pages that are being blocked. 
 Most specifically login pages owned and operated by small companies. 
 Major Contendors like microsoft or adobe are not an issue, but smaller budget companies it&#x27;s hit an miss on whether or not my firewall will let a login page load. 
 I&#x27;ve tried going into my firewall log files to trace the blocks and white list the Domains/ip&#x27;s but even with those domains marked as enabled the loading screens fail to load. 
 However they work perfectly fine when I bypass my network and hotspot on my phone. 
 I&#x27;m running on the assumption that there&#x27;s some secondary domain required for my whitelist before I can load the login pages correctly. 
 So the question is, can I record it? can I run some kind of tool on a web page while it&#x27;s hotspotting on my phone to create a log of that all the web browser is trying to call so I can make sure the correct items are white listed in my firewall? 
 How would you go about resolving this?

 Got the usual is this legit email from users.
 Looks like someone is phishing our users with our own Azure branding. Has our background, logo same font etc. Defiantly phishing. Logged with Microsoft as usual in the portal.
 The display name protection in Office 365 didn&#x27;t get it as the was just from company name. If it had our HR manager or directors, it would have got it.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m the IT Manager for a local county. Our domain is appomattoxcountyva.gov We use Rackspace as our email provider. We are still receiving emails, but today at about 10AM our emails stopped sending, throwing this error:
  
host
 relay-webapps.rsapps.net[172.27.255.140] said: 550 5.7.26 550-5.7.26 This
 message does not pass authentication checks. Destination server has blocked
 your message. Please fix your domain DNS configuration, Thanks!.
 (ZD/67D1379) (in reply to end of DATA command) 
  
We haven&#x27;t needed to touch our DNS configuration in about 5 years. 
 Nonetheless, I logged on to zoneedit.com to adjust our settings.
 I used MX Toolbox and it shows our SPF, DKIM, and DMARC records all to be in the green.
 Still, no emails are sending from our domain.
 ​
 Admittedly I know very little about these records, because like I said we&#x27;ve never had to adjust them. 
 Am I doing something wrong? I would be happy to share any additional information as needed.
 ​
 If you can help at all, I sincerely thank you in advance.

The amount he told me for pay months ago is more than I have ever made and more that I’m worth on paper based on no degree and certs. 
 He was a very good boss and I like working for him. He was willing to train and love that I asked millions of questions to get better. Now he is the CIO so he’d be hands off where he was more hands on when we were together.
 Currently I’m a IT Support Specialist but more so a junior or regular system admin based on what I do. The pay raise would be a 45K difference. In my current …</span>

                              <span>Like, I&#x27;ve been busy all day, but very little has been accomplished. 
 Just, the work I&#x27;m doing is 1. Extremely complicated, and 2. Requires constant verifications and double checks. So every small change I make, I have to go back and double check that the change was correct and that it had the consequences I intended and constantly have to verify that everything still works and I haven&#x27;t broken anything. 
 In short, it&#x27;s been a hectic day with tons to-do, but very little to show for it. 
 And I know you guys have those days too. Do they ever demotivate you? Just the feeling that you&#x27;re not actually getting much done?

                              <span>I remember seeing someone post about this a while back.
 One of our helpdesk guys was getting this laptop ready to use as a loaner. Unfortunately I&#x27;ve broken our MDT server temporarily so they decided to image it with our Windows 10 installer from VLSC. They imaged it, connected it to our network, and now we have a screen that think&#x27;s it&#x27;s needing to be joined to another company.
 https://i.imgur.com/cZ0WYYz.jpg
 I&#x27;m just curious if anyone knows of a proper way to get this taken care of. We&#x27;re not attached to it. It&#x27;s out of warranty, but we would prefer to give it some more life at least as a loaner or through our recycling company that repurposes some computers for local non-profits.
 We bought this laptop direct from Dell too, not a 2nd hand one.
 EDIT: Thanks for the recommendations. Have a ticket in with MS. Just waiting for someone to get back to me.

                              <span>One of our remote facilities decided to DIY install an RFID door access system. As you&#x27;d expect, they went for the cheapest option off Amazon and some sketchy freeware. These:
 https://www.amazon.com/Access-Control-Supply-Converter-110V-240V/dp/B01MXY4FDN/
 and https://beseencontrol.com/
 The IT department only heard about it after they&#x27;d tried installing the software and connecting the controller to the network.
 The software is sketchy as hell. The business is based in China, there&#x27;s no EULA or licensing, every reference to the software calls it something different and they&#x27;re all super generic names.
 For all the red flags, I can&#x27;t point to anything that proves it&#x27;s dangerous. I really don&#x27;t want to be the bad guy shutting down a project because I have a bad feeling. OTOH I am the company&#x27;s security officer and I&#x27;ll be responsible if/when this thing compromises our network or leaks sensitive information. 
 How do you handle this kind of thing without building a bad reputation?

                              <span>India and a few other Asian countries is where level 1 and specific higher level issues are taken by Microsoft and many other companies because of course, money. I believe AI will eliminate those jobs but sysadmin jobs will be needed to be staffed by people. Also, higher level calls on server issues and PCs will also need onsite sysadmins. That&#x27;s not even including server appliances, iot, WiFi, cyber security, and many others. 
 Companies have slowed cloud growth. Eventually we will see growth end and find that a lot of companies will continue with on-prem and private cloud servers over the massive outages from AWS and Azure. That will require hands on.
 What&#x27;s your take?

                              <span>I had someone text me and ringing my phone on Sunday for something that is a new project but not an emergency. But somehow they expect me to work everyday including weekends. She went as far as kept texting late at night. So this morning she escalated to my manager as if I&#x27;m not doing my job. I understand this during business hours but it&#x27;s as if they expect me to work over the weekend for something that&#x27;s not an emergency and not responding to it results in an escalation and just making me look bad with management and not only that but it becomes retaliatory in the sense that they make a big effort to make me look bad and at the same time demand higher urgency in retaliation, like trying to make my life harder because I dared to not respond over the weekend.
 This is very usual at my company and the sad part is that company management sides with these bullies, because they&#x27;re heralded as heroes of the company that keep moving it.
 Sorry for the rant, I just feel sometimes they feel we&#x27;re not human.

                              <span>Been picking up a relatively large project since the new year and I just need to vent about how it&#x27;s driven me to levels of pissed-off I&#x27;ve not reached in years.
 ​
 Numerous times I&#x27;ve been given *link_to_wiki_article* around some of the systems I&#x27;m dealing with, how to access them, etc. only for the documentation to not cover it in the slightest, or to be so vague as to send you on a wild goose chase through nested folders of documents.
 ​
 There&#x27;s nothing more frustrating than having people confidently tell you &quot;follow the documentation explicitly, it covers everything you need!&quot;, only to immediately hit something not covered by the documentation and falling at the first hurdle.
 Adding to the frustration are quirks and such that I had specifically asked about because I suspected they may become an issue, only to be told &quot;oh no, just do this&quot; as per the documentation.
 *thing doesn&#x27;t work*
 &quot;Oh, that&#x27;s not working because ____&quot; (_____ insert thing I fucking asked about previously)
 ​
 Make sure you document the shit you assemble, folks.
 Especially if you&#x27;re handing it over to someone and confidently pointing them to your incorrect or missing documentation.
 ​
 So far I&#x27;m counting about a week of wasted work from being led back and forth by different people that can&#x27;t agree on the correct process, and it&#x27;s really rubbing me the wrong way to hear &quot;that&#x27;s because of ___&quot; as if I should just know already!
 If it&#x27;s a known step, add it to the fucking documentation, you cretins!

 Onprem Exchange servers which sole purpose is management only - Do they need the latest Exchange CU for it to be as secure as possible?

                              <span>Long time lurker, first time poster on this account, thanks for all the information shared. We have a corporate partner (CP) that manages an existing tenant. Meanwhile, we are our own standalone org and aren&#x27;t required to use the CP&#x27;s services. Being on enterprise M365 licenses, we&#x27;ve been able to use the Power Platform (Power Automate, Apps, BI, etc) with great success but we keep running hitting ceilings on what we can do without admin access.
 Some of those things would be account creation automation based on roles, dynamic group memberships, Azure AD (we have traditional on prem DC), SharePoint customization, use of Intune, etc. All that is cool, but when the C-Suite learned the CP can technically access all of our email, OneDrive, etc, they became very committed rolling our own tenant. 
 So here we are! We&#x27;ve been reading up on implementing a non-routable domain into a hybrid Azure AD setup, email management, MFA setup, what the a transition looks like for our end users, etc but we all know academic knowledge vs implementation experience are two very different things. Fwiw, our CP is supportive of the transition so bad blood and politics shouldn&#x27;t be a factor here.
 What are your thoughts on best practices, things you would be looking out for, general advice given this scenario? 
 TL;DR We&#x27;re moving away from a tenant managed by a &#x27;provider&#x27; to our own in-house management, asking best practices, advice for setup, etc.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I&#x27;m trying to figure out the average cost of having Dell replace a disk or a raid controller battery on an out-of-warranty storage array. Country is France.
 The only information I&#x27;ve managed to find is that in case of need, I&#x27;ll have to pay a 450€ diagnosis fee before I can even get an invoice for the actual intervention.
 The bosses want to stop paying for the warranty extensions and are asking what&#x27;s the financial risk in case something happens.
 Thanks in advance for any info on that !
 Cheers!

                              <span>I never expect much from Microsoft Support, it usually takes plenty of back and forth before you can ever make progress if it ever does happen. But my last experience with them left me dumbfounded.
 I raised a ticket for an issue that inadvertently affected all of our mobile users, and upon their first email to me I was told it would be escalated to their intune team. I recieved one email from intune support asking to provide relevant information, then radio silence for the next 3 weeks. I sent maybe 4 followups asking when I would get a response, but to no avail.
 Fast forward to today, I finally get an email from them saying they have been trying to reach out to me but I must be busy so they will archive the ticket. Scrolling through the email thread, yes they have been &quot;trying to reach out&quot;, but all of their emails after the initial one to gather more info were sent to my email address except with the domain slightly misspelled. The thread is full of NDR&#x27;s.
 I find it hard to believe that someone employed as an intune specialist would not realize that receiving NDR&#x27;s that my email address does not exist would not realize that I&#x27;m not receiving the emails. And what a coincidence that they finally got my email address correct when sending the case closure email. I guess their reply button must have been broken and causing my domain to be misspelled on all the emails where they try to offer assistance.
 Anyways I&#x27;m just here to rant, after several days and hundreds of re-enrollments we have gotten things under control. My already rock bottom expectations from Microsift support have reached a new low.

                              <span>I work from home about 2/3rds of the time and spend the other 1/3rd in the office. When working from home I always RDP into my office workstation and for the most part I&#x27;ve had no issues. I have a 3 monitor setup at both work and home. The office workstation is almost 10 years old, and I&#x27;m attempting to upgrade to a newer box which is much better equipped but RDP access to the box is much slower, lags, and the most annoying thing is that upon connection the screen flashes black for a couple of minutes (but not every time) before finally settling down. Performance when physically at the box is good, definitely better than the 10yr old box. Both are in the same OU, Have the same Windows 10 Enterprise image, and have the same Group Policy applied. I&#x27;ve disabled the RDP hardware graphics acceleration which my research shows to be a cause of the flashing screen upon connection. I use RDP in the course of my daily routine on various devices and have never encountered an issue like this, RDP is generally something that just works and most of the time I can&#x27;t even tell that I&#x27;m connected to a remote box. It doesn&#x27;t appear to be a client side issue or a multi monitor issue, performance is consistent if I&#x27;m connected across the VPN or locally from any device and no errors are indicated in the event log. 
 For a number of functional and psychological reasons I need a physical box that I use both when at home and at the office. Do you have any recommendations on how to improve RDP performance on this new box? 
 Here are the specs:
 New:
 HPZ2 G9 i7-12700, 32GB ram, Nvidia RTX A2000
 Old:
 i7-3930K, 32GB ram, Nvidia GeForce GTX 660

                              <span>Hoping to get some insight from those who are already using this solution before I start to set it up myself in 365. 
 I have had a look at recent posts regarding this, but most are a few years old.
 In trying to find a replacement for our current IT Helpdesk solution, I have noticed that Microsoft have a pre-cooked IT Helpdesk template available for people to setup as a Teams SharePoint site:
 Template info can be found here.
 My questions are:
 Anyone out there currently using this? 
 How are you getting on with it?
 How comparable is it to other helpdesk solutions you have used? 
 How does the Microsoft Lists integration work with regards to logging, managing, and interacting with users? 
 Are email notifications a thing when tickets are updated/assigned?
 Thanks for reading, and thanks in advance for insight!

 Anyone got experience with new account spoof/phishing incidents like this and did you ever find out how they got the email address? 
 Dont think they signed up to anything weird or got phished as it&#x27;s an experienced IT admins email ,

                              <span>I&#x27;ve now had 3 usb-c monitors with built-in hubs fail - could my set-up be causing this or am I just very unlucky with hardware ?
 My set-up is a work laptop connecting via single USB-C to a Dell monitor, daisy-chained via DP to another Dell monitor. Primary Dell monitor has built-in usb-c hub with peripherals such as webcam, mouse, keyboard etc connecting to this.
 Failures - 
 1) U2419HC lasted about 18 months then usb hub stopped working. Video was fine. Tried swapping cables, using different laptop, no joy. 
 2) Dell replaced first monitor for U2422HE. This worked fine for 2 months then again usb hub died
 3) Dell replaced again, for U2421E. This has lasted just over 3 weeks, and again usb hub has died. Literally working for few hours in the morning, now no peripheral is detected. Multiple power cycles of laptops, monitors and unplug then re-plug usb devices to no avail.
 ​
 Are usb-c monitors known to have very cheap/flaky hubs ? 
 Could something I am doing be responsible for breaking the hub somehow ? I can&#x27;t see how as my usb devices are nothing unusual - logitech mx keys wireless keyboard, wireless mouse, logitech webcam, Majority RS1 microphone.
 Any suggestions welcome...

                              <span>This is kind of a dumb question because I&#x27;ve been told &#x27;no&#x27;, or &#x27;it&#x27;s not the best idea&#x27;, or &#x27;it is a major security risk&#x27; but I want to know from some people who&#x27;ve faced the issue of needing centralized authentication for cloud applications and services. 
 I don&#x27;t want to use Azure AD or a third party service (yes, I am aware it&#x27;s probably smarter or safer). I have a huge handful of applications and services, both on and off site that require login (obviously) and we have the option of LDAP authentication. 
 Is it safe, smart, or even possible to have an LDAP server that faces the internet to help authenticate users?

                              <span>Hello, title is worse than actually it is.
 Also, this is for my home network, just i wanted to be more professional to setup a domain for 3 computers. Is this subreddit right?
 The story:
 Years ago, i setup a Debian vm to act as a domain controller in my home network, two W10 PCs and 1 W11 PC.
 Because Samba 4.9.5 (the latest for Debian 10) doesn&#x27;t play nice with windows 11 22H2, I tried to install samba 4.17 from Debian-backports but i&#x27;m a linux n00b and I accidentally wiped the VM.
 &quot;LOL, let&#x27;s try again, let&#x27;s restore the latest VM backup&quot; - I told to myself.
 the problem is that the latest VM backup is one year old and doesn&#x27;t have the W11 PC on it. If i rejoin the domain, will I lose the account on the W11 PC?

 For about 75% of the time it is sitting on 1%CPU and 98% reading from SWAPIN (seen by iotop) 
 When we launch the next job is there anything I can do from the shell to suggest the OS uses more RAM instead of swap? (I&#x27;m unable to reboot the system as there is another job with 2 weeks on the clock which would be sad to kill)

                              <span>I am experiencing a terrible issue, where the FortiClient (version 6.0.9), installed on many workstations, was uninstalled just out of the blue. It is not clear if this is due to the endpoint protection (we are using Trend Micro Apex One). What is sure on the other hand, is that if I install the Forticlient by hand, it gets uninstalled each time. This happens only using version 6.0.9 (or 6.0.*), while not happening with version 7.
 - Anyone is having the same trouble?
 - Anyone has suggestions on how to troubleshoot this?
 Thank you all.

                              <span>Hi folks,
 A bit of background - I&#x27;m technology lead for a company of ~100 users. I manage a small team that is responsible for support and development of in house LOB applications and I am also the escalation point/main point of contact with our MSP who support our Active Directory, Microsoft 365, device setup etc.
 ​
 We have a problem at the moment where our main customer service inbox is at 98% capacity in Exchange Online. We have an in place archive with a retention policy that archives mail older than 3 months and it is increasing in size so we know it is working, but the rate of inbound mail seems to be greater than the mail that is being archived as the inbox size isn&#x27;t decreasing.
 ​
 To help resolve this we&#x27;ve created a new inbox (which I will refer to as the Customer Service History inbox from here onwards) and we&#x27;ve asked our MSP extract all email sent/received before 01/01/2021 as a PST file to upload into the customer service history inbox - then they will delete all mail sent/received prior to 01/01/2021 from the live customer service inbox.
 ​
 Due to the size of the PST file our MSP is struggling to do this.
 ​
 We had hoped initially that we would be able to use the SearchMailbox PowerShell cmdlets to copy mail across inboxes rather than having to do a PST export/import but these cmdlets have been retired in Exchange Online and I couldn&#x27;t find a suitable replacement PowerShell command that works.
 ​
 The industry I work in requires us to retain customer emails so we can&#x27;t just delete all the old mail.
 ​
 Does anyone with more experience in this area have suggestions about what we could try?
 ​
 The ideal outcome is that:
  
The customer service team can still access old emails for complaints/compliance/legal cases
 The main customer service inbox stays well below 98% capacity (for at least another year)
  
​
 ​
 Thanks,

                              <span>Only locally saved files seem to have this issue. When opening Office files from a working network drive there&#x27;s no problem. It seems like Office wants to check all present network drives before opening the file causing it to hang on the loading popup. If I net use /delete the drive, the problem is fixed instantly. 
 Has anyone seen this issue? I have been looking for a fix to disable this &#x27;drive check&#x27; when opening apps or their files. 
 Yes, network drives are old-fashioned and I want to get rid of them too but it&#x27;s a slow process as they&#x27;re ingrained in lots of stuff at this company.

                              <span>Hello,
 I started managing a software deployment system and the current image is deploying multiple dotNet packages to a Windows 10 x64 image. How does dotNet Framework versions work, are they backwards compatible?
 We are deploying 3.5 SP1, then 4.5.1, then the patching automatically updates those.
 Would it be enough to simply deploy the latest dotNet Framework version and it would be backwards compatible?
 Or is this a bit like Java, where applications programmed for it expect a certain version and it has to be exactly that one, so you might end up with multiple dotNet Framework installations?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>Hi ,
 I have a problem with LAPS
 The problem occurs when we add new computers to AD.The laps is installed according to the procedure. I installed it in November, since then I have added several new PCs. After adding the user to AD, we use gpupdate to install certain programs.
 The LAPS is installed, but when I want to generate its password, I encounter this problem , it doesn&#x27;t generate password only expiration date .I tried all solution i found on the net , also I installed the x86 version but without resultAlso we have radius that auto connects to the net after the user accesses the account .How can it be solved, or if there is a solution ?
 P.S : Probably missed some things but i&#x27;m open to any idea . THX :D

                              <span>Hi all,
 Finally biting the bullet and clearing out a decades worth of old kit from our offices. We have found a partner to take the phones/laptops so this is covered but what are you guys using for general E-waste? I&#x27;m talking the hundreds/thousands of old VGA cables and DVI cables. Old Access points and dongles that have been collected over the years etc etc.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi everyone 
 I used to use spiceworks for monitoring, helpdesk and inventory for multiple client remote systems using the agent install, reporting back to a entral server we&#x27;d access.
 I&#x27;ve looked at &quot;spiceworks alternative&quot; in the sub, and see the following routinely recommended: 
 https://www.jitbit.com
 https://www.paessler.com/prtg
 https://www.zabbix.com
 https://zammad.org 
 Before I start testing each one out, are there any others you would recommend? (preferably open source) 
 Many thanks guys

                              <span>Long story short, 
 I need advice/solutions that can work with the ballsache that I have at the moment.
 We are running Jira 7.5, this uses basic auth to pull tickets for support mailboxes
 MS doesnt do basic auth, but our domain provider does
 So a solution that kinda works was implemented
 Basically, you mail itsupport@stupidasscompany and it gets forwarded to itsupport@seconddomainforsupidasscompany where Jira picks it up and logs a ticket for you
 Problems, Sometimes the end user (external clients) get a bounceback
 Bounceback shows client@stupidasscompany instead of client@clientsrealdomain. If the client mails the same mail, it goes through. Fails are random
 So verification is failing. I have disabled verification on the domain provider&#x27;s side. But this hasnt fixed the issue
 Oh and our company makes use of 365 
 The bigger bosses dont want to upgrade Jira becuase of legacy costs... We cant move away from it as the company has managed to implement it in too many systems...
 Basically im screwed at the moment and would love some light in this tunnel.
 Please dont judge me too harshly. Im working with what i have

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I am hoping someone has a hint for me. One of our clients has a Dell SAN, which has an &quot;access&quot; LUN that is used for inband management connectivity. The LUN is published to all hosts, and that cannot be changed from the SAN (AFAIK).
 One of our people build two new hypervisors recently, both of which have attached this &quot;access&quot; disk along with the legitimate volumes they need. It appears in disk manager as a 20mb offline disk. Diskpart tells me it is set to be read only.
 The issue I can see is the system log being overrun with constant NTFS errors, all pointing to the GUID of this disk.
 I want to take this disk offline on the hosts, but not sure about any possible ramifications (it seems OK since it looks like some sort of named pipe style channel for use by the dell management utility), and not sure the safest way to remove the volume without affecting the other LUNs on the same iSCSI target.
 Does anyone have any hints or tips for me?
 Thanks for the help.

                              <span>Network guy here with some dumb questions since I&#x27;m out of my domain. Working for a small office with Windows Server 2019 Standard installed by a previous Sys Admin. I have two users overseas who need access to a specific application that is painfully slow over VPN. 
 It ocurred to me they can use RemoteApp but I don&#x27;t know what kind of licenses they would need. I installed Remote Desktop Services and published a single RemoteApp program and it seems to work fine but I&#x27;m getting a warning that the Remote Desktop Licensing mode is not configured. 
 Will the RemoteApp program stop working after the grace period? what kind of license do I need for one or maybe two users? Any price ranges on the license cost?
 Thank you

 I understand that the NDC resolves IPv6 addresses to MAC addresses. However, does it also determine what port to forward the packet to based on this resolution or is this the function of the bridge table?
 ​
 Also is an NDC and Bridge table kept for each NIC or just 1 table per device.

                              <span>This is also an issue with our 3560 switches.
 Copper switch with a 4 port sfp module. These ports can do either gig or 10 gig speeds. We have 1 10 gig sfp in each switch and we are using that as our uplink.
 Why is it that when I do a show run on the switch, I see both gi1/1/1-4 and te1/1/1-4, as if there are 8 total ports, when really there are only 4? Is there a way to configure it to only show the 10 gig ports?
 And the reason I am asking is because it is not consistant on all of the switches. We are using 10 gig on all the switches, but some show the 1 gig ports in the running config and some dont. And this is causing some issues for some scripts I am trying to run. So just curious if there is a command I can run to get rid of the 1 gig ports from the running config. When I do a &quot;show interface status&quot;, I do not see the 1 gig ports, only the 10 gig ports.

Does the AP need to support any 802.1x features or does it solely just pass the traffic back to the WLC to proxy to ISE? Could the AP impact the authentication or does it have anything to do with radius in this topology. 
 ​
 ISE &#x3D; Authentication Server
 WLC &#x3D; Authenticator (Proxy to ISE)
 Desk phone &#x3D; Supplicant
 ​
 Another question was were could reauthentication originate from in this. I believe it could either be set in ISE under authorization policies or on the WLC in the global config or per WLAN. Co worker seems to think the AP could also impact reauth.

                              <span>Hey all, got a bit of a strange situation I stumbled upon. For reference this post deals with two separate sites that are unable to communicate with one another (or correctly at least). For simplicity I&#x27;m going to refer to them as Site A and Site B and the majority of the IT team including myself works at a different branch from the two.
 I first became aware of the issue when a member of the helpdesk team brought up that Site A can&#x27;t communicate with Site B. Surface level this appeared to be true as he had run ping tests from the DC at Site A to the gateway at Site B receiving &quot;Request timed out.&quot; response. However, Site B can ping Site A without issue... I assumed that this is some sort of blocking issue with one of the FortiGate&#x27;s since one of the sites can send ICMP echo packets it wouldn&#x27;t be a routing issue. But I see nothing related to the ping tests shown in the logs on Site A or Site B&#x27;s FortiGate. I would run a pcap but the deployed models do not have onboard memory unfortunately.
 Then it started to get a bit confusing, I ran a trace route from a VM at Site A to Site B and it completed without issue. The sequence of hops was as follows: Site A VM -&gt; Site A Layer 3 Switch -&gt; Site A FortiGate -&gt; Site B FortiGate -&gt; Site B Layer 3 Switch -&gt; destination IP.
 Out of curiosity I ran a perpetual ping test from Site A to Site B for 10~ minutes and shockingly saw a couple successful ping attempts among all the &quot;Request timed out.&quot; responses (98% loss for reference). Site A is also able to communicate with all of our other sites without issue.
 Any advice or tips for this? This one is starting to make my head spin and I feel I may be missing something obvious.
 Edit: Forgot to mention - Site B responds to ping from all of our other sites without issue.

                              <span>I manage a 5 story building and am trying to extend IP cameras and WiFi to the other floors. There are a couple of ventilation shafts that I could run cables through, but they’re not along a corridor so I would have to punch holes through a tenant’s unit to grab the lines into corridors.
 But the elevator shaft is right there and would be so much easier. I have the tool to open the door and stop the elevator. If I run it through conduit it wouldn’t interfere with the elevator.
 Is that stupid dangerous? Have any professionals here run lines up a shaft? Is this a huge code violation??? Will I be featured in Darwin Awards??

 But what do you think? Is this true or BS? 
 The only thing I can imagine is that, if you are going for the application centric approach, so using whitelisting and contracts etc., that you don&#x27;t need firewalls between each segment for east west traffic, obviously, perimeter firewalls are still needed.
 Correct?
 Also, if your ACI is based on a network centric approach, so no Contracts (expect a Contract to allow all) etc. then you would need 100% firewalls, like on any traditional network, right?

Now I won&#x27;t be utilizing even a tiny amount of that IP address space but it will grow and I will have to keep that subnet available to the world. That leaves me susceptible to neighbor solicitation flooding by IP addresses that aren&#x27;t even used yet. How do you go about protecting yourself against that type of attack?

                              <span>So I&#x27;m designing a network but I&#x27;ve been on the fence about stacking and not sure if it&#x27;s still a go to. 
 So imagine you have a collapsed core design with 2 Core switches and 4 Access switches. (might add another AS in future)
 So I&#x27;d just connect every AS to each CS (so redundant uplink), run VRRP and L3 on the CS&#x27;s, no need for STP (!WIN!).
 What benefits does stacking have in this setup? (Data stacking)
 -Do you not connect each AS to the CS in a stack?
 -you have a single SSH session to control the whole stack, fair.

                              <span>Hi,I have 2 ip cameras set with a static ip…do you think I should create a dhcp reservation to avoid the server from assigning the camera’s ip to something else? Can static ip+dhcp reservation work simultaneously? Thanks

                              <span>We&#x27;re a team of 12-16 Architects working locally in an office, with other team members in different countries and many users working from home from time to time.
 Several years ago, we installed and implemented Egnyte to combine local and cloud storage with a simple NAS. Since then we have migrated to their hybrid drive solution with an expensive ,windows server running the server software and a windows plugin on each computer serving files from the cloud or the server, depending on location. The search path for all files remain the same. A great server solution with hardware costs remainso nothing. Useful and straightforward, in theory.
 In reality: The service is expensive since we have a lot of server data (around 10TB) and the hybrid software makes the work in our CAD software very slow since each work session loads hundreds of files and the hybrid software/server solution becomes incredibly slow. In reality, we need to sync all folders locally even when we are on our LAN with a server.
 As an administrator without any professional knowledge of IT systems, it is near impossible for me to find other alternatives and compare the pricing and functionality. We will need to get out of this as soon as possible.
 Which Egnyte alternative should we look into? 
 (Sorry for the low-quality question.)

 But since there is a 40 GbE spec with Cat8 cable over 30 meters, I was wondering, do those transceivers actually exist? FS doesn&#x27;t have any, I can&#x27;t find them anywhere.

                              <span>Hi there,
 Let&#x27;s take AWS as an example.
 The question is: does AWS different data centers, distributed across a wide geographic area, show a considerably more stable connection, from latency point of view (RTT), than the connection of say a random client and server, connected across the same geographic area?
 For instance, if we measured the RTT between two data centers of AWS, one in Australia, and the other on the West Coast US, does that connection any more stable than say one client in Australia connected to a server in California?
 Or do these data centers have no unique connection between them whatsoever?

 I am using aprwatch(8) but it needs a Linux machine with a interface in the monitored vlan so it does not scale too well.

                              <span>Hello all,
 we have a client that wants to refresh the WLAN infrastructure (Interasys) and bought two 9800-L appliances with X many APs. The appliances are directly connected to the ICX core switches with 4x fiber uplinks.
 On the WLC side the configuration is straightforward and consists of:
 - MGMT+RMIs in VLAN 1 (MGMT). Yes I know, it is recommended not to use VLAN 1 but that&#x27;s the reality and the client can&#x27;t change this right away and maybe does not want to.
 - 5 VLANs for SSIDs.
 - One VLAN (VLAN 10) for access points as per request from the client. The existing WLAN infrastructure is an old Interasys System with the APs on a separate VLAN and separate physical link to the core. We tested first with VLAN 1.
 - The uplinks are configured as trunk of course and on the native VLAN side …</span>

I have two transition switches at a jobsite that need to communicate over a single multi mode strand. Being that the name implies that multiple transmissions (i.e. send and receive), I thought this type of item would be easier to find.

                              <span>Hi 
 i was wondering if someone could shed some light, Currently trying to create a bash script to alert me when a port is opened but not sure if im missing something on the script or if its because it not possible with the website https://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/
 ​
 #!/bin/bash ip&#x3D;$1 port&#x3D;$2 email&#x3D;$3 # Check if an IP argument is provided if [ -z &quot;$ip&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Please provide an IP address as an argument&quot; exit 1 fi # Check if a port argument is provided if [ -z &quot;$port&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Please provide a port number as an argument&quot; exit 1 fi # Check if an email argument is provided if [ -z &quot;$email&quot; ]; then echo &quot;Please provide an email address as an argument&quot; exit 1 fi # Send a request to yougetsignal.com to check the port response&#x3D;$(curl -s &quot;http://www.yougetsignal.com/tools/open-ports/?remoteAddress&#x3D;$ip&amp;portNumber&#x3D;$port&quot;) # Extract the status of the port from the response status&#x3D;$(echo &quot;$response&quot; | grep -o &#x27;Port [0-9]* is [a-z]*.&#x27;) # Check if the port is open if [[ $status &#x3D;~ &quot;open&quot; ]]; then # Send an email alert echo &quot;Port $port is open on IP $ip&quot; | mail -s &quot;Port $port Alert&quot; $email else echo &quot;$status&quot; fi 
 i tried to debug it and found out the response is &#x3D; to nothing which therefor not going to the second part
 ​
 Thank you

                              <span>TL;DR - Grafana and Influx installs on Linux will require updating their package signatures since the developers have rotated their keys after a vendor breach.
 In case you haven&#x27;t heard, Grafana and Influx are customer of CircleCI who recently announced that another one of their customers had an OAuth token compromised and has put all other CircleCI customers at risk. It has been recommended that all CircleCI customers rotate their secrets.
 CircleCI incident report for January 4, 2023 security incident 
 I found this in my personal home lab when looking into package update failures for Grafana and Telgraf this weekend, and confirmed it was caused by the invalidated repo keys. You&#x27;ll need to follow these instructions to fix it.

                              <span>Hello everyone! 
 We just deployed a new RDS broker running windows server 2022 version 21H2 build 20348.1487, the licensing runs on a separate vm, with two server session hosts. During day one of its use in the main environment to user terminals no one could connect and they would get just blue color(not BSOD) screens or black, pulseway monitoring would be showing the system online and offline repeatedly. we would have to hard shut down the server. The system would come up, users could connect and pulseway reported normal and show the below errors, then the system would run normally for some time but then it would repeat in the same pattern. 
 multiple
 A timeout (90000 milliseconds) was reached while waiting for a transaction response from the iphlpsvc service.
 then this would come up 
 A timeout (90000 milliseconds) was reached while waiting for a transaction response from the NlaSvc service.
 ​
 This happens every day since its deployment, and I can not find any rhyme or reason for it, it&#x27;s the only system doing it, it is not the only windows server 2022 standard in operation. 
 Has anyone come across this issue before? I can&#x27;t really find anything on this, it is easy to mitigate right now but the force shutdowns are going to take a toll.
 Thank you for any help!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been struggling to square my current career with where I came from.
 I grew up doing construction with my dad (kitchen and bath remodeling). I moved on from working with him pretty quickly, but at one point in my 20s I was making $572/week as a &quot;Utility Assistant&quot;. This involved varied tasks such as helping the foundation crews break big rocks into smaller rocks, or pulling a softball sized wad of human shit and used tampons out of the building&#x27;s sewage masticater by hand. For $572 a week.
 Most of my friends are still kind of in that world, or working similar physical labor jobs. Waiting tables, light construction, housekeeper at a hotel, retail, etc. I don&#x27;t think any of them make over $40k, and they work really hard to get it.
 Last year I made $202k for doing basically fuckall. I sit in a perfectly climate controlled office in a $1500 chair while pushing buttons and staring at screens.
 I don&#x27;t know. There&#x27;s no real point to this post. The whole thing just feels kind of gross. 
 I miss my friends, but I&#x27;m feeling increasingly disconnected from them.

 I&#x27;m looking for help with a DNS transfer from Google Workspace to Microsoft O365. Unfortunately I have no idea where to start and what to ask, does anyone have any suggestions on a local MSP that can assist?
 Thanks!

 Updating to KB5019274 has resolved this.

 This has only effected 2 of our Dell Laptops with Dell WD22TB4 Docks and Dell Monitors. 
 Sorry there isn&#x27;t any futher information at this point. Currently still investigating

                              <span>I manage the IT of a small 25 person engineering company and the boss wants everyone being able to work at every desk and even outside of the office in a remote work setting. Because of this the users were already set up with beefy workstation laptops and docking stations at home and every office desk before I started at the company.
 The problem is that the CAD files are stored on a central fileserver in the office and when the users work remotely they work off an SMB connection to the office over VPN which results in extremely slow access speeds and file corruptions.
 I wanted to set them up with individual tower PCs at the office instead or at least a pool of a few PCs in the office and let them connect to those remotely with RDP. Though firstly the boss doesn’t like that option because he wants everyone to be able to work at every desk and secondly the test engineers complain about latency problems regarding their 3D work in programs like Revit and AutoCAD. For example they say rotating the view is too cumbersome over the remote connection. I’m currently testing parsec instead of RDP but that has similar problems and is quite buggy.
 So my question is, how do you make occasional remote work, preferably with laptops, work for resource heavy CAD users working from a shared network drive?

                              <span>U6-Enterprise units (U6 Pro is also affected in a manufacturing batch according to this thread: https://community.ui.com/questions/U6-Pro-Sparks-and-Shuts-Down-When-Mounted-to-Grounded-Mountpoint/11277a7f-ff18-4a60-aecf-e2bda4fc485f?page&#x3D;1)
 I originally thought it was related to the shielded cable we used on the shop floor, or the zillion arc welders, or the multiple 480V conductor bars for any of the 10 cranes. 
 I posted a picture of it trying to arc-weld itself to its mounting hardware on the ui.com thread above (page 3), hooked to the biscuit jack with an UNshielded cable, homerun back to the grounded patch panel with the grounded STP insert for the patch panel, hooked to a Ubiquity enterprise 8-port &#x27;enterprise&#x27; switch.
 With the ungrounded patch cable from the AP side the only thing electrical going to the AP are pins 1-8. One of those pins carrying PoE is bonded with the chassis, which I&#x27;m guessing is really a powder-coated metal. When you use the metal mounting plate and that is touching metal it makes a nice circuit, then the Ubiquity PoE switch shuts off PoE. 
 The AP works great with a grounded or ungrounded patch to the biscuit jack, just as long as it isn&#x27;t touching anything metal. Swapped it out with an AP that was working fine mounted to a plywood sheet just to be sure it exhibited the same symptoms. It did.
 Doing my best not to rant, we spent a lot of time on this. The firmware roulette problems we had a couple of years ago on the UAC-PROs is still fresh on my mind.
 Our date code 2237.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I got inspired lately from a post about a differences between a Cloud engineer and DevOps and as someone with mostly a traditional Linux System admin background i have found my self not enjoying so much my current role as DevOps Engineer which is focused more on a developer aspect and working on a project currently that its coming from a telecommunication company which i dont like their weird ways...or even worse the so buggy products that we have to deal.
 By said that i have told my manager that i want a career path focused mostly on Cloud and tools like terraform and Ansible. Like a Automation Engineer or Cloud Engineer...
 Do you think its a good choice for someone that doesnt enjoy development much, is all the way in for remote working and also hates the buggy products from telecommunications companies?
 When i first started working as DevOps i was feeling like it will be interesting and closer to system admin stuff but i feel disappointed now.
 Luckily my company hunts always new clients and projects so i have room to push my manager even to switch teams and clients, so i can work on stuff that i find beneficial for me.
 But whats your opinion?what stuff should i hunt to work for to avoid bad situations in work and achieve the career life i want?
 Also, I am someone that doesnt like abstract thinking or mathematical way of thinking and development so..hehe
 Do you think also for learning Green fields projects are better?
 So much questions and discuss topics that i have in my mind...

                              <span>Do any of you feel as though sysadmin jobs, or any other tech job, are not nearly good payed as coding? It seams as though just having a CS degree as a programmer entitles you to a 100k+ job, while others (like sysadmin) must go through a learning curve until they can be responsible for infrastructure and earn more, but still not close to programming.
 I&#x27;m a wrong? Am I a not looking for the right jobs? To be more specific, i look forward to being a hybrid sysadmin, but I get discouraged when I see that the coding path is well payed, 100% remote and no late nights for updates and stuff.
 What is your experience/thoughts? Unionize? Lol

                              <span>Hi all! Hope someone can help me out.
 I have Windows 10 clients and 2012 R2 servers. Was experimenting with UNC hardening trying to force encryption via the RequirePrivacy flag.
 I have a DFS namespace with 1 file server that hosts our shared folders. There is \\ourdomain.com\Data\RedirectedFolders and \\ourdomain.com\Data\Shares
 I was trying to force encryption on Shares. Shares has a target of \\fileserver1\Shares
 In my UNC hardening GPO I put \\*\Data\Shares and \\*\Shares and RequireMutualAuth, Integrity, and Privacy.
 When I open up the Shares folder (through a shortcut on the desktop that goes to \\ourdomain.com\Data\Shares or by using the actual file server name \\fileserver1\Shares) and do Get-SmbConnection in PowerShell, Encrypted returns False.
 I also tried with another server that hosts a specific shared folder. I put in the GPO \\*\ShareName and then on the client went to \\differentserver\Sharename and it still shows encrypted as False.
 Can anyone help me understand what I am missing? Is it possible to encrypt these connection via the RequirePrivacy flag?

Just figured I&#x27;d ask before I grab another spool of riser from Home Depot.

 I&#x27;ve looked at Deepnet Security but looking for alternatives. We&#x27;re talking a small quantity (5-10) and preferably a Pre-Programmed token that can be activated in the AAD portal. 
 Any recommendations would be appreciated.

                              <span>I have a project I’m in charge of which is due at the end of March. Now, all my ducks are in a row and I absolutely need my director’s signature on a proposal sent to us by our supplier because I don’t have the required signing power for a purchase of this magnitude. Inventory availability is an issue but there’s a hold on all of the items we need which guarantees us delivery if we sign by 4pm this coming Monday. Otherwise, we’ll lose out on substantial savings and instant rebates if we sign after Monday. Now, the last thing I want to do is go over his head to our CTO and I’ve asked him a few times if he was comfortable signing but keeps asking me to go back to the supplier and have them confirm the most minute of details which have no impact on him signing the proposal. Should I speak with my direct manager and ask his advice and maybe HE can push my director into signing it sooner rather than later? I want to deliver this project before the deadline and there are a number of things that need to be done after signing the proposal which are also incredibly time consuming (removal of old equipment, coordinating cabling, coordinating installations, down time, etc.). Even with roughly 60 days left, I feel like I’m still running out of time…

                              <span>Yeah yeah, I know, telnet is not secure and SSH is better.
 But this is for learning purposes and all containers created on isolated lab.
 Managed to install telnetd, but I can&#x27;t find any telnetd log in the following common locations.
 http://pavelgk.pbworks.com/w/page/14905991/Configure%20Telnet%20and%20other%20xinetd%20Services 
  
/var/log/messages
 /var/log/syslog
 /var/log/secure
 
 Did I miss anything? How to I check telnet authentication log? Thanks 
 p/s: Again, yeah yeah, I know, telnet is not secure and SSH is better. But this is for learning purposes and all containers created on isolated lab.

                              <span>As a previous lone sys-admin I&#x27;ve recently gotten a part time team of two helping out during heavy load and allowing me to take vacations without being interrupted too much.
 The CEO wants to &quot;brand&quot; us with custom designed hoodies. His idea was a matrix theme with a &quot;blue or red pill&quot; picture and the text &quot;I took neither&quot; indicating trust no one and a crosshair with &quot;Zero trust&quot; in the back. I think the front idea is a bit far fetched and the back just a bit boring.
 Do you have any good ideas? Could be anything as long as it&#x27;s IT related with a touch of humor.

                              <span>Recently found a very nice high capacity 2.5 inch PM963 for a good price that I mistook for a PM863, the SATA based cousin. So, this post is two questions.
 I wanted to possibly look into adapter options to see if I can get it to run over SATA on a basic adapter. My m.2 slots are full on my main machine, and I have no other PCIe slots. Would that be feasible? I&#x27;m unsure if U.2 runs on the same voltage as SAS. I&#x27;ve done a ton of digging on the matter and I can&#x27;t get too clear of an answer. I&#x27;ve seen cheap adapters like this but I&#x27;m unsure if they&#x27;ll do what I need:https://www.amazon.com/Wixine-Board-Small-Adapter-SFF-8482/dp/B08DLX9YD5?source&#x3D;ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&amp;ref_&#x3D;fplfs&amp;psc&#x3D;1&amp;smid&#x3D;A1RV7R81U3FOKU
 Before I bought anything else I did want to see if the drive was working with what I already had laying around.I got a working T3600 with a working H310 for free last week that appears to have the latest software on it, but it couldn&#x27;t see the SSD in Physical Disk Management. It had a SATA SSD in it for a boot drive and all of that worked fine before I went to switching things around. Although I&#x27;m quite certain Windows on the poor little Patriot SSD was corrupted at some point. RIP
 I could feel the U.2 slightly warm when it was plugged in which was a good sign. Physical Disk Management couldn&#x27;t see it. I&#x27;m not sure if I need a new cable or other components to get this working correctly just so I can make sure the drive is good. I&#x27;m pretty green on this topic. Figured I&#x27;d come to the experts. I&#x27;ve done a good bit of research and asked r/IT what this even was to get the ball rolling in the right direction. I&#x27;m realizing how strange my request truly is. What would you do in my situation?

                              <span>I&#x27;m experimenting with database connection - basically I want to remotely pull data from the database through ODBC for use in Excel
 My current situation:
  
mariadb is in a docker container in a synology NAS at xxx.xxx.x.xxx:3306
 phpmyadmin (via reverse proxy to phpmyadmin) can access the database with no problem
 reverse proxy is setup to point to xxx.xxx.x.xxx:3306 with address https://abc.def.ghi:443
 I can access my data with no problem if I&#x27;m connected locally (using xxx.xxx.x.xxx:3306)
  
Now I&#x27;m trying to connect to the db remotely through odbc - how should I do it? what address should I use? https://abc.def.ghi:443?
 Things I&#x27;ve tried:
  
using https://abc.def.ghi:443 - Unknown MySQL server host &#x27;https&#x27; (11001)[HY000]
 using abc.def.ghi:443 -Lost Connection to MySQL server at &#x27;reading initial communication packet&#x27;, system error: 0[08S01]
  
Any help and advice? Thank you!

                              <span>Hi guys,
 Can anyone point me in the right direction to trunk a FS.com 5850-32S2Q switch to a Cisco 9200L ?
 I have setup the basic trunk but it seems to cause issues with my network.
 switchport mode trunk and switchport trunk allowed vlan [VLAN list]
 on both 10gb uplink ports
 Tried encapsulation, didnt work. I have trunked it with a 9300 and it works perfect with these commands so obviously it is something on the FS.com switch
 what am i doing wrong ? can anyone please help ?

 Thoughts? Is this a workaround?

 If I buy a used GigaVUE 420 on ebay, does it need licensing or can i power it up, configure it for tapping/spanning traffic and it will work?

 I need to do some policy-based routing on a Dell s50 switch running 8.4.2.7. I&#x27;m inexperienced with this in general and there&#x27;s not a ton of info on doing this with Dell switches beyond the basic configuration guides.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve got the relevant configurations below. I&#x27;ve attempted to use a specific source and destination in the redirect list, applied/removed/reapplied the list in the vlan interface, etc. 
 ​
 I have a feeling I&#x27;m just missing something about how this works. 
 ​
 I have a switch with 3 vlans:
 Vlan 192 - 192.168.1.40/24
 vlan 10 - 172.16.1.1/24
 vlan 20 - 172.16.2.1/24
 ​
 ​
 I have 2 pfsense firewalls, one is in vlan 192, and is 192.168.1.1 and the other is vlan 10, 172.16.1.2.
 The switch has a default route pointing to 192.168.1.1.
 ​
 Everything works as expected in this configuration, but I need to redirect some traffic to the other pfsense firewall.
 I&#x27;m attempting to route any traffic coming from vlan 20 to 172.16.1.2 with the following configuration:
 ​
 ip redirect-list test1
 seq 5 redirect 172.16.1.2 ip any any
 ​
 interface Vlan 20
 description TEST VLAN 2
 ip address 172.16.2.1/24
 untagged GigabitEthernet 0/11-15
 ip redirect-group test1
 no shutdown
 ​
 Status output:
 ​
 switch#show ip redirect-list
 ​
 IP redirect-list test1:
 Defined as:
 seq 5 redirect 172.16.1.2 ip any any, Next-hop reachable (via Vl 10), ARP resolved
 Applied interfaces:
 Vl 20

                              <span>As I said in previous post I&#x27;m rolling up to multiple sites to tidy/colour code cables in the cab. There is no documentation what&#x27;s so ever and I need to work out what&#x27;s going where. My plan of attack is to check each cable with a cable tester and then hunt around for the node at the other end. There must be a quicker way.
 Was thinking about using something like lansweeper to documents everything, but I don&#x27;t think it documents ports on the switch. The switches are HP Arubas. I may be answering my own question but
 Could I get a list of MAC addresses from the Switches and tally them with feedback from LanSweeper.

                              <span>I am hoping this is the right place for this because I am severely stuck. I will preface this with I have been in DevOps for 2 years and am comfortable in AWS, however networking in general is not a strong point in any way, so if this is dumb - I can take it. 
 We have a project which requires a site-to-site VPN from our AWS VPC to a customer who is running Cisco ASA. I have had the VPN set up in various ways because they keep changing requirements. However that latest requirement I am not sure how to handle. 
 Their statement is - &quot;We look for interesting traffic on our router and when it finds it, it creates the tunnel and closes it when no longer used&quot;. So it sounds like a tunnel on-demand thing? Now, the only information we have are the endpoints in their network which we access through the tunnel. How do we send &quot;interesting&quot; traffic for them to create the tunnel if we need the tunnel to send our traffic? 
 I keep thinking that they didn&#x27;t give us an important piece of information - like this magical endpoint. Or are we supposed to initiate the tunnel? It seems like a very chicken-and-egg situation that I am not able to wrap my head around. 
 As I said - networking neophyte here but desperately looking for some understanding of what he is talking about. So I know the right question to go back with.

                              <span>My client is evaluating moving from their legacy on-premises deployed monitoring tool to something more modern. We are discussing whether the new solution must be fully deployed on-premises or whether to with a SaaS-based management console. Most of the infrastructure to be managed is on-premises tho&#x27; there is a growing footprint on Azure.
 If you have strong preferences one or the other, please let me know.

                              <span>I am curious what the suggested best practice is for removing shared inboxes that used to be an employee regular mailbox. When an employee leaves the company, if the supervisor needs access to to their email account afterwards, we keep the user licensed and convert their email to a shared mailbox. We then remove the user license. After a month or so the supervisor will let us know that they no longer need access to the email and so we convert it back to a regular mailbox. As that user no longer has a license I assumed the inbox would disappear and senders would get a bounce back. Seems instead that the users inbox still exists and is receiving messages even though it is not licensed. I am not concerned with backups as we have that covered in another system. I am just curious what the correct method would be to remove the shared mailbox so that it disappears and users get a bounce back if they try to send to it. Seems like deleting the shared mailbox is the correct path?

                              <span>Hello Guys,
 I need your urgent assistance on this!!!
 I performed Windows Server Backup on one of our production servers. Because we don&#x27;t have a proper backup system that&#x27;s why I used the default backup of Windows Server.
 I chose schedule backup so I successfully backup the initial one (Jan 27). Then I forgot to stop the schedule backup so it was overwritten the next day ( Jan 28)
 And now I need to restore the server to the initial stae but cant no longer select the backup point on that day (Jan 27)
 Is there any way I can still restore the server on Jan 27 state?

 I&#x27;ve been in my position for a while so I&#x27;m really rusty so I&#x27;m not sure if there are new industries at the moment that check the boxes of what I&#x27;m looking for. Hoping higher ed, or K-12 at the moment but open to suggestions.

                              <span>Hello! A bit ago I posted in here in regards in getting a job. I finally was able to take on a IT Support role for a University. My official role is Department Technology Analyst, but that’s just a fancy term as business analyst/IT Support. 
 I’ll be in charge of a department to resolve issues for professors, set up new machines on the domain with sufficient apps, recommending/purchasing new devices for department/faculty/staff, etc. This department is mainly Apple with a few hits of windows computers. 
 My questions:
  
Anyone have tips and tricks as a new IT person?
 Any advice on setting up new computers? For right now, I’ve been setting them up with a local admin account, then adding the device to our Domain, putting my own AD credentials as admin, then installing apps such as O365, Cisco vpn, adobe CC, and such. It’s mostly manual work.. I’ve never scripted before but would like to get this automated.
  
Any advice is super helpful and I’m excited to grow in this role. Thank you!
 EDIT: I should say most of the devices I will set up will not be shared, but staff want to start using their AD logins instead of having local accounts.

                              <span>I stumbled across a feature in Windows Server 2022 called SMB Compression which, according to my understanding, allows quicker transfer of files over your network by compressing files (if you tell it to). The concept seems relatively straight forward, I think in practice you can use SMB Compression by:
 • Using Robocopy with a /compress switch in your CLI
 • Mapping a network drive using Net using the /requestcompression:yes switch
 • Enabling this option in the Windows Admin Center on a File Server so file copying will default to using compression when end users copy to or from the network share folder on a server with this option enabled.
 My question is - is my relative understanding of this feature, more or less, accurate? Also when it comes to file compression, don&#x27;t you lose quality when it comes to files such as jpegs, or does it compress the files to transfer them, thus lowering bandwidth requirements, and then decompress the files once it reaches the destination?
 Is this feature relatively esoteric? There really seems like no downsides unless the files stay compressed. Any admins out there successfully utilize this? Thanks all.

Would you support the notion of your state-sponsored identification card (driver&#x27;s license, etc) being dual-use as your digital signature? In other words - would you be interested in having your state/country offer you the ability to sign documents with your driver&#x27;s license/state ID card? You set the pin/etc when you get your license, and then you could perform critical functions by using your certificate vs having to go into physical locations.
 ​
 EDIT: just in case it isn&#x27;t clear - I&#x27;m specifically talking about a state-level/national-level installation of PKI. Your driver&#x27;s license would be the PKI token that was issued to digitally validate your identity.

                              <span>I&#x27;m gonna be put on a practical test to see if I can administer the IT systems alone or with little guidance for a period of 2 months where I&#x27;ll be given full sysadmin rights. It&#x27;s a great moment that can catapult me from L1 helpdesk(which I&#x27;ve currently been in for the past 3 years) to system administration. What are some tips that i should know to make the most of this or shine well -what i can think of right now is I should introduce scripts that will automate some tasks.

 When users connect to a usc g5 dock or g2 dock WebEx, zoom and teams switch to the HP USB C audio device. This causes a lot of issues for our users have to change audio device all the time.
 Anyone found a way to disable this across the board or any other solution?

 I feel like I should be really going down a specific path at this point, whether it’s networking, security, Windows, etc. 
 Anxiety comes over me when I try to decide whether I should learn new stuff or really focus on one discipline. Which causes me to think I’m not doing the right thing, and then I end up frozen with worry. 
 What helped you figure out your “thing”?

 What happened?
 Between 07:05 UTC and 12:43 UTC on 25 January 2023, customers experienced issues with networking connectivity, manifesting as long network latency and/or timeouts when attempting to connect to resources hosted in Azure regions, as well as other Microsoft services including Microsoft 365 and Power Platform. While most regions and services had recovered by 09:00 UTC, intermittent packet loss issues were fully mitigated by 12:43 UTC. This incident also impacted Azure Government cloud services that were dependent on Azure public cloud.
 What went wrong and why?
 We determined that a change made to the Microsoft Wide Area Network (WAN) impacted connectivity between clients on the internet to Azure, connectivity across regio…</span>

I now need to set up a few Windows machines for community use. They need access to Internet and Office. They have been using a generic account to log into the machines before and I am ending that. 
 Inam confused of the use of Shared PC and KIOSK and Guest logon. So what am I looking for? How do I get it so the machine auto login and can access what they need while also not opening me up to security threats?
 Devices are hybrid joined but I currently do not think I have intune set to use any policies and we have been relying on GPO and SCCM for management.

 I need to deploy a computer to a very remote location. Access to the location will be very limited but physically secure. 
 Do any of you have tips for setting up the computer (Windows) to make it somewhat better suited for remote use?

                              <span>Hi everyone! I have a Notebook with one USB-C Port, which I use for power supplies. I want to connect a portable USB-C display as second display (LG gram +view) but there is no free USB -c port on my notebook.
 I ask me what USB-C docks (without extra power supplies) you guys are using for scenarios like this? :)

                              <span>Hello sysadmins,
 We are a team of three and we all work from home. One of the members of the team will disappear for hours throughout the day. This is not only affecting our team&#x27;s performance, but also our mental health. Projects that rely on him have been delayed for months. He says he stays up all night to finish stuff, yet nothing is finished. He doesn&#x27;t even do the bare minimum and our manager is aware of this. This has been going on for over a year now. We have to do double work because of him and we are both exhausted.
 My other teammate and I have both complained to our manager. Our manager says he is talking to HR, but it is very hard to let someone go. Nothing has changed so far. Our manager is a very nice person. A little too nice IMO.
 This guy finds creative excuses every time.
 We recently found out he is the owner of an IT consulting company. Do we bring this to our manager&#x27;s attention? We feel like we need to confront him.
 Let me also say I don&#x27;t want to leave my company. I mean if I have to, I definitely will. I&#x27;ve been through one burn out and I don&#x27;t won&#x27;t to go through another one.

 sorry for all the questions, just a dude who works electronics department at walmart wanting to learn and eventually get into a sysadmin role at some point so my knowledge is limited.

                              <span>Hi Sysadmins, 
 We have an online portal where our customers can log in with SAML. The portal has also contained our homepage - so both of these have been running on www.ourdomain.com. 
 We&#x27;re now in the process of building a new homepage on a new tech-stack (WordPress). This will split our solution into 2: 
 - The new homepage running on www.ourdomain.com
 - The portal (with the SAML functionality) running on portal.ourdomain.com
 Here-in lies the issue. All of our customers have their SAML setup pointing af www.ourdomain.com - but in the future, our SAML setup will be hosted at portal.ourdomain.com. Is there a best approach to redirecting (or something else) the SAML requests to our portal and let this handle the login process? Or do we need to tell all of our customers to update their SAML configuration? 
 All of our customers&#x27; metadata is pointing to e.g. www.ourdomain.com/saml and www.ourdomain.com/metadata 
 If at all possible, we&#x27;d like to avoid telling our customers to update their SAML setups (as many of them will be using manual metadata). 
 Is there a smart way to do this with redirects / re-posts etc. that wont break the existing SAML setup by moving it to a subdomain? 
 Thanks a lot guys.

                              <span>Hello I have a few years of experience in IT. Especially in the field of telecommunication, network and enterprise applications.
 I would like to get a recommendation from system administrators on how we can set up and run our employee and customer endpoints in the easiest (least effort) way.
 Important points are:
  
Microsoft 365 available
 Security is important (Can a 2-factor login be set up with Windows?)
 Insider Risk Management (tips, tricks, software)
 Easy update, patch management
 Group Policies (More tips, tricks?) (Is it possible with M365 or do we need an Domain Controller)
  
​
 Thank you very much!

                              <span>I have one site where there are Ip Phones and workstations connected to only a Cisco sg200-26 Switch (24x 1Git UTP and 2x SFP 1Gbit). Also a HP ML 350 Fileserver is there, mostly providing File and SQL traffic to the Windows 10 Clients.
 ​
 Now as only some clients are needed with a 5 Gbit Network to the Server I&#x27;ve installed a Zyxel Nebula 1930-10 Switch (8x 10Gbit, 2x SFP+).
 The necessary Clients mostly with 5Gbit USB (Qnap Adapter) are already connected to the Zyxel Nebula Switch. Should I replace the old Cisco 24Port with a faster Switch or just connect the old cisco sg200-26 via Uplink to my new Zyxel Nebula Switch? If yes: What SFP Module would you recommend? I see there are some no-name modules which can be flashed for common Switch brands.

                              <span>So I started at this company last fall, I was told by my recruiter that they do profit sharing at 10% each February. Today in passing I made a comment about how with tax returns and the upcoming bonus I was told about its going to be a fun next month. My coworkers looked at me confused and chuckled &quot;what bonus?&quot; I explained what I was told in the hiring process and they said they have no idea what I was told about and they&#x27;ve never received that. Honestly pretty pissed and im hoping they were pulling my leg, might be looking for a new gig towards the end of next month.. Any tips on dealing with recruiters again? Any recommendations on a safe one to reach out to?

                              <span>I’m not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I was wondering if I can use power apps to make a form that would basically guide a user through submitting a change request.
 Basically, there are about 4 different type of requests. Each one can branch off into a few different fields. Some of the fields will ask the user to fill out an external excel file and attach it. For these fields I want to add links to external training documents so they know how to fill out the excel file. Some requests require 1 approver, while others require none or multiple. Some selections should even prevent a user from submitting the form because a change request is not required. 
 Right now this change request is requested through email so there’s a lot of user error with what people submit. I’m hoping a form like this can make it dummy proof. Is power apps the right tool for something like this?

                              <span>I am very much able bodied, so I am happy to count my blessings in that regard. 
 I drove by a homeless man today who was missing one of his arms. He was holding up a sign asking for handouts. Felt bad for the guy, but I didn&#x27;t give him any money or food. There&#x27;s a bunch of homeless around the area. I don&#x27;t know what kind of circumstances in life led up to his condition, but it gave me pause for thought. 
 I like working in networking and IT. It would make me sad if I had to work another field. I&#x27;m just not sure how well I&#x27;d do in it without the use of both arms though, seeing as I need to type.
 I guess I could use some speech to text stuff, but things would generally be a lot more difficult I feel like. I don&#x27;t know...was just wondering if anyone with physical handicaps would care to share their stories in working in the network engineering field.

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious to hear how the more seasoned professionals would handle this task: I&#x27;m running low on ip addresses on our lab network, so I&#x27;m looking into creating a private Class B 172.16/16 network across a couple vlans and then having a firewall like pfSense handle the NATing between the private and lab network. Would you a) have the firewall handle the routing for all of the private vlans in addition to the NATing, or would you b) have a separate hardware router device handle the routing between the private vlans and then set the gateway of last resort to point to an ip address on the pfSense firewall? Thanks!

                              <span>Hey folks!
 First time setting up two routers in a HA pair using the HSRP protocol;
 My ISP is providing me two links and two IPs (for each routers) plus a virtual IP. So far so good.
 What&#x27;s not adding up for me is that they insist that the gateway IP I must use on the WAN side (first hop) is the same IP as my virtual IP (WAN Gateway IP &#x3D;&#x3D; VIP). And of course my equipment is refusing to apply this config... &quot;cannot use same IP as gateway for the Virtual IP&quot;.
 I read a bunch of documentation but I still cannot understand how that would work.
 Equipment is Meraki MX105
 https://documentation.meraki.com/MX/Deployment_Guides/MX_Warm_Spare_-_High_Availability_Pair
 Don&#x27;t go too hard on my, i&#x27;m a sysadmin not a network admin ;) 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on a network for a robot/rover, trying to figure out the best way to implement the physical layer. We have a moving robot at a 200m max distance, and we need to connect it to a base station wirelessly. My current plan is to set up a parabolic dish with gimbal controls at the base, and an omnidirectional antenna on the robot, however, I&#x27;m not sure whether it will work properly and how it will deal with obstacles such as trees, bushes, and concrete. Open to any comments and critique. Feel free to direct me to a more appropriate subreddit. Here&#x27;s a diagram. https://imgur.com/a/rU0Prvy

                              <span>Hi networkers,
 in order to recertify my CCNP I plan to take the 350-901 DEVCOR exam. I hope you can share with me what one can expect in the exam while respecting the NDA of course. Here&#x27;s what I mean.
 It is a well-known fact that CCNA and CCNP level exams do not use actual devices for the exam, not even virtualized OS. Configuration tasks are done in a mock-up CLI environment with limited functionality. How are DevNet exams in this regard? For any &quot;implement script utilizing API X&quot;, is there a full-blown Python shell available, with help() and introspection? Is there any API documentation available, or is candidate expected to know all the different product APIs intimately?
 I have 10+ years of experience in Python and network automation, I&#x27;ve written 10k+ LoCs of Python for network automation, new Ansible modules, thousands of LoCs of Ansible playbooks and roles, integrated different vendors&#x27; products and APIs, I&#x27;ve worked with UCS/Firepower/Netmiko/onePK/NETCONF/etc, but I am not too keen on memorizing APIs of products that may become legacy next year. What are my chances of passing with limited study only to refresh Docker and look into Kubernetes that I never used before?
 Thanks for your replies.

                              <span>Okay, so I get the idea behind IPv6, there is a very limited amount of IPV4 and with so many devices online, we needed to expand the IP space. BUT
 Since everyone and every technology stack I know is capable of using NAT, I dont see much a use for it, is there companies out there who stricly use IPV6 only? I imagine even if they wanted to make their whole organisation IPV6 and disable IPv4 this would lead to some legacy systems not being able to work correctly.
 Am I wrong ? Can someone enlight me with the benefits in having IPV6 is that something it will become more implemented in the future you think?

                              <span>Hey guys. I&#x27;ve been beating my head against a wall now for months fighting with Zayo and troubleshooting speed issues we&#x27;re having with a 1G DIA circuit from them. We&#x27;re colocated in a datacenter with them, and the uplink from their handoff to our gateway is SMF, about 50 feet away.
 Our gateway is a Ubiquiti UISP Console, which if you&#x27;re not familiar, is 10G capable. So it&#x27;s well up to the task. We also had similar speeds with both a UISP Router, and an Edgerouter X SFP. The SMF uplink is connected through a 1G SFP module.
 Running the built in UISP speed test, which originates on the gateway, we always get in the 200-300Mb download range, and 900Mb+ upload. I&#x27;ve gotten the same results from a laptop testing through WifiMan, SpeedTest, TestMy, DSLReports, etc. All the same.

 Is there a throughput limit enforced in the Sonicwalls by default? I couldn&#x27;t find anything in the settings. It says it&#x27;s got a 1gbps connection

 ​
 I was looking to replace Forcepoint for my business and was thinking about Umbrella. However, I hear conflicting good/bad reviews about it. Therefore, want to ask if it does well with malware protection, and web filtering. Also, how about logging DNS queries? and any other suggestions than the CISCO umbrella is appreciated

                              <span>Hello! We built a NetMotion Secure Access server on our server VLAN (10.1.4.0), with the intent of having VPN clients reach out to a DHCP server and get an IP from a newly created 10.1.74.0/24 range. However, I&#x27;m trying to conceptualize how this would work with regards to routing and our firewalls. A couple of notes:
  
NetMotion, as far as I know, has no configurable static routing/VLAN assignment/etc
 In order for clients to get an IP from the desired range, we give the server an IP to use from it (10.1.74.5). The server sends DHCP requests using that address
  
With that said, I suppose my question two-fold:
  
How exactly would that work? If our firewall sees packets from the 10.1.74.0 subnet coming in on the server VLAN, it will block them, correct? Is there a logical way to allow access without creating a bunch of weird access policies?
 How do we configure routes for traffic destined for the VPN subnet? Would it be as simple as creating a static route that points to the server&#x27;s IP? Any past experience I&#x27;ve had with VPN involved them living on firewalls that did all of our routing, so it seems foreign doing things this way.
  
Any thoughts you folks have would be appreciated. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I work for a small company, I don&#x27;t do networking as a career or anything but we hit a slow period of work and I&#x27;m a bit geeky so I looked into updating our old &quot;server&quot; and trying to get better than 100 megabit transfer speeds. 
 We were using an old PC running Windows 7 with a few hard drives in it that was being shared on the network and that was it, that&#x27;s how they&#x27;ve ran it for like 10 years. I just Frankensteined a pc with TrueNAS on it, I went to our network closet and saw that our cabling was Cat5, sadly didn&#x27;t realize it was only Cat5, not 5e, so we ordered a Gigabit network switch and plugged her in and.... No gigabit speeds. Damn. Still only 10mbps when transfering to ol Frankenstein. Now I&#x27;m talking to the owner about running new lines under the building with Cat5e or Cat6a. Owner is kind of down, Co-owner who is 20 years younger is less down and thinks its absolutely not worth it and will barely impact our workflow. 
 I&#x27;ve done a rough estimate on the plugs we actually use in the building, about 700&#x27; worth of cable so we&#x27;d buy a 1000&#x27; spool. My concern is the owners wife wants the building to be usable for the next person if they ever sell. When they built the place in 2006, they ran the Cat5 IN THE WALL using the &quot;Home Run&quot; method, where they drilled holes in every.. 2x4... and pulled the ethernet cable through. The owner is pretty sure they also stapled them to the 2x4s every so often. So there is no way of pulling them out. I think we reuse the current ethernet outlet spot, ditch the cable in the wall, and back in the &quot;network closet&quot; we shove the cat 5 cable in the wall and patch the drywall. Unless there is another use for Cat5 I&#x27;m not aware of that would be a good reason to get a dual plug and actually have both and make both usable. That would kind of solve both issues. Anyone have any ideas?

                              <span>Basically, if you were given a blank slate. You can design the network any way you wish. What would you mandate to avoid layer 2 stretching but still retain virtual machine mobility?
 Anything goes, just as a mental exercise. 
 I was personally thinking something along the lines of exabgp… but I’m not sure yet how.
 Anything to avoid vxlan, evpn or otv to accommodate someone insisting on l2 stretching.

                              <span>A bit of clarity to what I am looking for. Let&#x27;s say I have a PoE switch that can only provide 802.3af level power, but the device that I need to connect requires 802.3at power. Is there a mid-span injector that can use the switches PoE to turn the output on and off as appropriate on the injector, allowing me to manage the device like I would any other PoE device on that switch, instead of having to connect to a PDU to bounce the AC power on the injector.
 I hope this makes sense. TIA!

I assume this would be something like PRTG or similar? Is there anything quick and dirty that doesn&#x27;t involve an entire setup as such that can be used? I&#x27;m merely curious - trying to get and understand as many options as possible. 
 This is an area or skillset that I lack and want to get better at so any and all recommendations are welcome.

 PCI3 has a 8GT/s capacity or 8GB/s one way (16GB/s duplex) for a 8x slot. 
 There are PCIe3 cards supporting dual 100Gb cards which is 12.5GB/s, exceeding the 8GB/s limit. 
 Ignoring GT/s and encoding loss, how would one achieve these speeds on a single 8x slot?

                              <span>Hi,
 We are a small business and so far MSP was handling the ASA 5515 firewall. We have let go of MSP and I am tasked with managing the firewall. I don&#x27;t have much routing &amp; switching knowledge (CCENT years ago). This may change, we might bring in network admin to configure the firewall and I guess I need to learn on the way to manage it. I might have to get a CCNA. I am a fairly new sysadmin for mostly linux/AWS and some windows.
 Currently we have about 15 users that use cisco anyconnect on Windows workstations and 6 linux users that use openconnect debian package for VPN. The internet speed is 250 Mbps symmetrical. 80% of infrastructure would be moved to cloud. Which firewall should be suitable for upgrading ? PA-440 would probably the most expensive although I don&#x27;t even know the ballpark of the cost. 
 Edit: We have four Ubiquiti USW-48 switches and one Dell Force10 S25. Two Unifi U6-LR access points. Less than 50 workstations.

                              <span>Multi Gig Small Office recommendations
 Hi Networking! I’m primarily an AV engineer but a facility I work with is looking to expand their 10 gig network. It’s a small office, less than 50 users (currently somewhere around 20 but may expand in the next few years), with several file servers on premise and a couple internet accessible services (behind reverse proxy through Argo tunnel). 
 What we need: -10GBe access layer to the workstations. -high reliability -Ability to VLAN/ACL various devices for access to various file servers. So basically, nothing unmanaged. -Likely higher throughput trunks between servers and switches, and between switches. All our servers are equipped with 4x10gbe. Probably a good implementation of LACP and STP. -that’s it!
 What we would like: -centralized-ish management, ability to manage with APs would be a huge bonus. 
 What we don’t really need: -POE
 Currently I run Meraki at my office, and I think this would be perfect but the cost of getting several MS355-24X (otherwise a perfect switch) might be prohibitive, and the license would compound that. I also run an Aruba Instant On network (automod removed my post for saying where), and their 1960 12XGT looks very interesting and priced very well, but I haven’t used any of their multi gig offerings. I like the ability to integrate with their wifi6 APs at a great price point too. Also highly considering the Cisco CBS 350 12XT and CBS 350 24XT. 
 Just looking for opinions and thoughts! Thanks

Specifically, if I add 256 host addresses into an object-group 0-255, will the firewall summarize that into a single /24? I would think so, but it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve never seen documented or talked about.

                              <span>So this issue started out as one site just timing out. The site worked on literally every other network. Had a colleague that is close by that also has a zayo connection test with the same behavior. Zayo of course is no help. Claiming it&#x27;s not their network. Their tech support also called me at 130am that was fun. As time has gone on there have been more and more sites we have issues accessing. Seen at least 5 now that number could be higher as some teachers probably just don&#x27;t report it and move on to something else. Have had the same colleague test those sites on their zayo connection with the same behavior. They all give some form of forbidden message. In the meantime I got our backup circuit setup in an sd-wan configuration on our firewall. So I just add those fqdn to the address group that is routed strictly out the backup circuit and they work just fine again. Has anyone ever had issues like this with an ISP? If so were you able to get it resolved?

                              <span>Hi. I am a rookie in the IT business and have a client with a very odd internet connectivity issue.
 At random times browsing the web becomes extremly slow networkwide. So slow that it timesout. At first I thought it was a DNS related issue but when using tools like ping/tracert/nslookup there is no problem. And browsing to google.se and doing google searches is very quick.
 Doing a speedtest shows nothing wrong there.
 ​
 And when I say random times I mean random times. The issue comes from out of nowhere and persists between 1-3 hours and then just disapears and everything goes back to normal.
 But has lately been occuring more and more. It used to occur once every month give or take. Now its more like every other day.
 The firewall used is a Zyxel USG FLEX 200 with latest firmware running in nebula mode and is not even a year old.
 DHCP server is on the firewall and DNS servers is set to 1.1.1.1 and 8.8.8.8
 rebooting the firewall does not help.
 Almost all clients run on ethernet. I talked to the ISP and they could not see any issues on their end. 
 I dont know what else to test/troubleshoot and could use some ideas.
 Any help is appreciated. 
 Thanks!

 I feel like I am failing in my networking role &amp; am curious as to what types of things to do all day. I have a couple issues I&#x27;m working on but still can&#x27;t shake this feeling. I&#x27;m hoping some of you wouldn&#x27;t mind passing along some advice

                              <span>I have deployed a GenieACS server. v4 connections are working fine. The initial connection, ability to summon, refresh parameters etc.
 When I connect a CPE via v6 the device is discovered fine. However it then loses all ability to communicate. I can&#x27;t summon the device or refresh the parameters. L3 reachability is there, this is just a super simple setup at home (our lab is too far away for constant physical changes) with a CPE and some VMs running KEA and GenieACS. 
 Does anyone have any experience with Genie and v6? I&#x27;m a bit stuck with where to look.

 For context: My company is trying to peer vpn with a huge company using public IP for the phase2 negotiation of the vpn. I have done vpn mostly with private ips but never public. I’m aware I have to create some natting but that’s where I’m stuck. I apologize for begging but I have scoured and utilized to the fullest with my googling skills for 5 days now but can’t find any configs that I can compare. Does anyone have a sample config? I just need reference and guidance to get this to work.

                              <span>Hi All
 I was about to order transceivers and an optic able from fs.com but then I looked at the &quot;Connectivity Solutions&quot; at the bottom of the product page and got a bit confused.
 I have a Mikrotik Routerboard with an SFP+ cage and a Netgear M4100 POE Switch with an SFP cage. I want to connect them using 1gb bidi SM transceivers.
 For the Mikrotik Routerboard I chose this one:https://www.fs.com/de-en/products/75335.html?attribute&#x3D;10243&amp;id&#x3D;198431
 And for the Netgear Switch this one:https://www.fs.com/de-en/products/32768.html?attribute&#x3D;10243&amp;id&#x3D;198433
 And I connect them using this fiber cable:https://www.fs.com/de-en/products/40446.html
 ​
 &quot;Connectivity Solutions&quot; at the bottom of the page suggests transceivers with reversed TX/RX
 Transceiver 1: 1310nm-TX/1490nm-RX Transceiver 2: 1490nm-TX/1310nm-RX
 I thought both transceivers need to have the same TX/RX for BiDi?
 Hope somebody can help me. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Throwaway because active redditor that doesnt want post trolls to learn this about me.
 Ive recently (as in last two weeks) received an adult adhd diagnosis and yeah, title. Im in Australia, in a semi rural area.
 Why tell them?
 - Extra allowances to work as I need (and those allowances sound like they&#x27;d REALLY help)
 - Bit of protection for when things go badly
 - Legally required because Vyvanse script?
 Why not tell them?
 - Already been a bit hard in the last 12mo and am on a performance plan (silly stuff that I knew the risks of, already massively improving, no further complaints from boss for a while)
 - Already shared some personal life info when I needed to provide extra care for my partner having a MH crisis, and that didnt seem to really do anything positive at all.
 - hate sharing private info
 - Not believed and maybe ridiculed behind closed doors?
 - May not deliver the benefits I hope for and just continue to make them think Im shit.
 Ive kept things brief here but can expand if needed. For now, assume Im a pretty capable l2/sysadmin kinda person that has yet to need any sev 1 or afterhours/OnCall escalated because I couldnt handle the people and/or resolve the problem.
 Thoughts?
 ​
 edit - the fact this is 66% downvoted is precisely why Im posting and asking. Sad, nasty, gutless, downvoters: here is a chance to share your opinions. Step out from your internet anonymity screen and speak your mind.

                              <span>Small office of older people who currently have office 365 for emails, and a local Nas for storage. Storage is mapped to drive letters and shared via depts. 
 What’s the easiest/cheapest way to move this to the cloud, keeping their current setup of drive letters? It looks like they get 1tb of free space for onedrive with their email subscription- but I can’t imagine they’d move to SharePoint. They would be up in arms if their drive letters changed, and I don’t think they’d like the check out/check in service. 
 Wondering what other smaller businesses are using? Dropbox? Google?

 I&#x27;m looking for a way to automatically send messages and tag the people in the Opsgenie Oncall schedule in a Slack channel when their shift starts, preferably with a customizable message.
 Do any of you have any recommendations or suggestions for third party apps or other solutions that do this since Atlassian do not have this functionality yet?

                              <span>We are in the process of moving over our virtual environment from one location to another. We are just using site replication to do this. Once the vm is seeded at the new location we just fail it over. Way faster than vmotion and we can fail back to the old one if their are any issues. We only have a 1gbps link between sites and maybe 200 100GB VMs. Everything was working fine until.... we noticed our backup system. We noticed that it thinks the failed over vm at the new site is a new VM. So now we have two back ups of the same vm. Has anyone experienced this before? We do not want to vmotion each on over. Thanks for any help.

 Do you suggest to keep using the vpn?
 Thank you

                              <span>Happy (RO) Friday Sysadmins,
 I took over as IT Manager for a small firm about 6 months ago, replacing an MSP. We got what we needed from them and kicked them out, and now have no contact.
 One of my requests to the MSP before departure was to remove us from their partner portal, as I have no ability to do that from the tenant. Surprise, this was never done! I&#x27;ve contacted MS &quot;support&quot; through the O365 admin page and they&#x27;ve basically told me to go fuck myself and it&#x27;s stuck there forever. For luck I&#x27;ve put in about 20 tickets on this, one actually got close. I feel like MS can absolutely do this if I fill out 700 forms and what not. 
 Is there any way I can get this relationship off the tenant? Every time I need to purchase licenses it gets in the way by two clicks, and I&#x27;m tired of being reminded that an MSP has us in their poral somewhere. Their access is neutered but it still feels like they&#x27;re part of the setup when they aren&#x27;t.

 Okay, so I started this job in 2019 as a computer specialist. Cool right? My day to day was to install computers and peripherals.. Cool, I&#x27;m just getting in the door I&#x27;ll do the simple mundane day to day. I have a co-worker (let&#x27;s call him Rick) and Rick holds the same title as I do. 
 Well, once I start here at this job, Rick suddenly becomes soo specialized in his &quot;job&quot; that he can no longer install a computer. Cool. Until it comes to installing a computer for a high ranking member in our organization, then he can actually do some work. Over the past 4 years, I have went and got nu…</span>

I hate networking and reading the documentation makes me want to blow my brains out. I have some switches approaching EOL, yet I have no idea how to configure a port. I can query the config just fine, but really gun shy on making changes on it. I need some decent training on networking and not sure where to look. I know enough to be dangerous, but not enough to be useful.

                              <span>I am starting to plan out our Windows 11 Upgrade for next year and would like to know how you are upgrading clients from Windows 10 to 11.
 When we went from Windows 7 to 10 we deployed new or rebuilt devices but have upgraded Windows 10 in place for new feature updates successfully for the past few years (as everyone else in the world). I&#x27;m now desensitized to upgrading the client OS with an upgrade. Years ago that would have been heresy and clients would be upgraded with a fresh OS install.
 Are you treating Windows 11 as a Feature Upgrade and just upgrading in place or are you taking the more intense route of deploying a new device with a fresh image? I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts and strategies.

 APC shipped us two brand new batteries instead of a warranty replacement for a small UPS. The battery pack is APC RBC 140, which appear to be for the Smart-UPS RT 5000VA. Instead of returning these two perfectly good batteries to them, they are telling me to drop them off at any random local recycler.
 I have absolutely no need for these. I&#x27;m not interested in spending any time trying to sell them. So, if you have a UPS/FedEx account and can send me a shipping label I&#x27;ll send them to you if you have a need for them. Box is approximately 80 pounds, 30&quot;x17&quot;x9&quot;. Or, if you are in the Houston area you can stop by and pick them up. 
 Send me a private message if you want them. If not, I&#x27;ll take them to a recycler next week.

                              <span>A little background. I started at this place fairly recently. Just prior to me starting, their accounting department decided to move from some antique accounting software, to using quickbooks. The sysadmin before me set them up with QB desktop and with the company files hosted on VM at a remote data center (which is a couple hundred miles away).
 Big surprise, the previous guy apparently never read the documentation from QB that clearly states accessing a company file over VPN is a shit show. Its massively slow. Like often taking 10+ minutes for a company file to open. To make things worse, the accounting department is using quickbooks in an unusual way, where they have hundreds of company files that all need to be accessible to the ~20 accountants. So throughout the day theyre switching between files and literally spending hours waiting on shit to load. Also, this means quickbooks online is not an option, because you pay per company file, and the service would be absurdly expensive.
 My first thought was to set up a NAS locally and based on some testing, this works great. Its nearly as fast as having the company files on the host. But to throw another wrench in things, the accountants often need to work from home. The DC and ASA are at the data center, and when using VPN from home theyre tunneling all the way to this data center and then all the way back to our office. This is actually so slow that most of the time you cant even open a company file.
 I know the proper solution is to run QB in a VM and use RDS, which I could easily do at our data center, but for whatever reason my boss is vehemently against this option.
 At this point I kind of at a loss. Any advice would be greatly appreciated...

                              <span>Hi all, I am a sys admin and got reached out by a recruiter for a Government job that offer a contract position for 6 months, during this time they sponsor me to get Clearance and I will be under their payroll, and then after 6 months they said I will be employed directly by the Government.
 They offer a very competitive raise (almost double what I am making now).
 I am just not familiar with this concept. The recruiting company is one with good reputation and reviews, however the 6 months thing scares me.
 Have anyone else got any similar experience and would you care to share?

 Thank you so much and happy Friday!

 Where do you guys find time to learn and get familiar with new systems or systems you want to demo while staying up to date on Helpdesk-level problems? 
 Maybe it&#x27;s due to my priority break down of things. Here&#x27;s my list of priorities as an IT Manager/Sole Sysadmin.
  
Problems stopping production / customers production
 Urgent requests / Priority requests
 Upper Management requested issues
 General Helpdesk Issues (anything from a single spam email to ERP/CRM report reworks)
 Network Maintenance Issues
 Network Update / Upgrading projects
 Learning new material time
  
I&#x27;m not sure at what point it&#x27;s enough volume to justify a second set of hands, but I can basically never get to 5/6/7 unless I work overtime hours.
 Does this make sense and has anyone else ran into this issue?

                              <span>I work at a small MSP and since I have studied for &amp; passed my CCNA last month, I have been able to recognize certain instances at sites where if I knew more, I could make things easier or more efficient..but of course I don&#x27;t have much experience within the trade. For instance, we have a client who has an office attached to their house and they all share the same network. It was deemed by my bosses that the reason the office was experiencing slow connections within the application they use is because of the switch they were using. That something might have &quot;happened&quot; to it or it went bad. They proceeded to buy 2 switches: 1 for the home network and the other for the office network. I traced the offices lines, plugged each respective line into the dedicated switches and plugged them into the ports I was told to in their firewall. 
 After everything was all said and done, I come back to the office and asked my supervisor &quot;couldn&#x27;t we have just made things easier by using one switch and separate the network using VLANS?&quot;. He responded &quot;Well, if something were to happen to the switch, such as a shock to the system, the switch would reset &amp; lose all configurations which would cause havoc&quot;. I was sitting there thinking to myself....well then by that reasoning, why everything else? Everything in tech is just as susceptible to that scenario. If you propose that scenario, then why even have managed switches? 
 I recognize that that is an extreme scenario he gave but how realistic is that? Has that ever happened to anyone? Are there way&#x27;s to mitigate it? Redundancy? Make the switch pull the start-up file from external server? Please help me understand and educate me :) Thank you for your time!

Looking for something that will basically store any inbound and outbound messages into/out of 365 for later retrieval - getting these emails back will be very few and far inbetween but its something the company Im working for is looking to do.
 Bonus points if it can store .mml files for reading

 SRP is set to deny by default so I am trying to add directories I was to allow programs to run from:
 I have added %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\ as a rule and even tried %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Local\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe 
 but I am still seeing this in my event logs:
 &quot;Access to C:\Users\msmith\AppData\Local\Microsoft\EdgeUpdate\MicrosoftEdgeUpdate.exe has been restricted by your Administrator by the default software restriction policy level.&quot;
 Any ideas? 
 In case is makes any difference, this is being launched from task scheduler.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve got a tablet app for primary school aged children available on Apple and Google app stores with a web browser version of it coming later this year. However, we&#x27;re having some issues getting schools that are interested, up and running which turns out to almost always be firewall / content-filtering related. Even giving it away for free, many schools just give up once they hit the problem.
 I&#x27;m hoping you can help answer some questions, as we&#x27;ve asked to speak to a couple of school admins who have deployed our app successfully to understand your world/struggles better, but so far we just get responses like &quot;it&#x27;s outsourced to X grid for learning, speak to them&quot;.

Do school networks in your experience tend to operate via a whitelist policy, rather than a blacklist?

                              <span>Looking to move away from Zix since we already have the Office 365 e5 compliance add on license for our users. Our Security team requires the ability to revoke messages. With Zix this is easily done by them. However, Following Microsoft&#x27;s best practice, we only have 3 global admins accounts. (2 users in PIM, 1 break glass). Our security team is not a global admin. Typically these revocations tend to be time sensitive and having our 2 global admins on call 24/7 for something ,IMO, as trivial as revoking an email is absurd. 
 Is the ability to revoke a message as an administrator really a global admin responsibility? Did anyone come up with a clever workaround this permission limitation? 
 Source: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/compliance/revoke-ome-encrypted-mail?view&#x3D;o365-worldwide#step-3-revoke-the-mail
 Seems a bit silly when the Security Administrators role already have the ability to purge messages using Data Explorer.

 we are currently working on a project to introduce a XDR service.
 Which providers do you use and how satisfied are you with your environment?
 Just interested which options (Endpoint Security + Firewall) are used in other environments.

 (MSP were fixing an error, which caused this to go offline).
 Is there anything to consider about restarting one? We have a server, switches, and VPN, all connected to it. 
 Its a 3 year old APC SmartUPS.... appreciate any guidance or tips....first time doing this.

 The recent KB - KB5022282 - fails to install on some Teams room NUC devices with the error code 0X80070002.
 We&#x27;ve tried all repair options possible but it still fails. Any ideas?

                              <span>I took some wireshark scans of our RDP app while I connected using my ip address and searching for the url of the app. We have two different networks on site. Network C is the main network, and Network X is the secondary network I have in my office to remote into other off sites.
 Once I captured the scans they appear to be completely different ways of communicating. I can see the the app on the C network communicates using HTTP 1.1 and it goes through a few hoops. I can see the app on X network communicates via DNS. The scans for X Network do not show HTTP linked to this app at all and the scans for C Network do not show DNS at all. The DNS method is much quicker than the HTTP method.
 My question is does that mean that the older C Network is using older/different networking protocols to launch/connect to the app? Does that mean that our newer X Network is using a DNS network to automatically connect the app each time making it quicker?
 I would post the scans but there&#x27;s confidential information in the data.

 I have two HP T410 AIO thin clients that use rdp to connect to individual VMs. I have one issue, HORRIBLE FPS!!!! The screen loads one line at a time, and is only usable when all options (Desktop background, Font Smoothing, etc) are disabled. But we need backgrounds to be enabled due to our backgrounds having bginfo enabled via GPO. What are my options for a resolution? Thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 What could i use to setup a little internal newsletter? Ideally i would like to send to about 30 users a couple of emails each month about reminders and tips. I have no internal email server and limited time to develop something on my own. I&#x27;m looking at Sendgrid but it seems overkill for what i want to do.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hello Gents,
 After 20 odd years this should be simple but my brain just is not working right.
 I have a 2016 AD Domain. I have an OU called &quot;testdept&quot; which as you can guess is the test department. I want the users in the test department to have local admin right on the PC&#x27;s in the test department. How best to go about this?
 &quot;Testdept&quot; has two sub OU&#x27;s &quot;Computers&quot; and &quot;Users&quot; anyone in the users OU should have local Admin rights on anything in the computers OU.

                              <span>Hello there, We have two VPN address ranges in the company. One of them is already added to the Azure Local network gateway and connection is established. We now need to add another address range, so another group of local users can access our virtual network. I added new address range to Local network gateway and it work fine for like two days - both of VPN address ranges have access to vritual network. After two days, every VPN address loses connection to virtual network for few hours. The next day, everything goes back to normal.
 I hope you can somehow understand problem description :p What could be the issue here?

 ​
 I&#x27;m just wondering - would this be required if there is no internet access? What would be the use case for implementing this in an air-gapped environment?

 My domain account is part of the local server admin group, the local admin group has full control of the folder and share (and is owner), but it won&#x27;t let me get in - giving the above error.
 I can check permissions (after clicking advanced to continue so I can see them) and they&#x27;re correct, no deny anywhere and effective access claims I should be allowed, but nope.
 Any ideas?

 We use AD tidy and a few other tools to manage local AD, but are there any tools you can recommend that can manage both Hybrid Azure AD and local AD at the same time.
 So removing users from groups, disabling users on certain criteria, etc.

                              <span>Hi guys, we’ve got a HA cluster of 2 Nodes and all the requirements for HA. Manual live migration works well, but during my tests if I simulate a power cut (unplug the power cable) on 1 Node, it’s VMs are shutdown and then moved to the next Node, then they power on. 
 Is there a setting/way I could change so the VMs are not powered off before migration when Node fails, or it is what it is?
 Thank all

                              <span>Hi,
 for Various reasons the specific Server has a Supermicro M11SDV-8C+-LN4F. It only has one PCIe x16 Slot. The NVME Slot is populated with the OS Drive, 2x 2,5 SATA SSDs are in a RAID-1 and this Server needs 1x SFP+ for 10GBit AND a SAS-HBA for an LTO-8 Tapedrive.
 Except using risers and splitters to make two 8x PCIe Slots out of the x16, there don&#x27;t seem to be any way to do this... No USB to SAS (the Tape drive only does 60-70 MB/s anyway and i only need one single SAS Connection as well), 10 Gbit SFP+ USB-Adapters are only availble with Thunderbolt (or so it seems)
 Another issue is: The Server is only 1U. So trying to shoehorn a 2x Riser in to that case will be another issue entirely.
 Anyone got some ideas?

                              <span>Hey guys and gals.. So, at our company I was tasked with finding a RMA software solution for managing defective products returns that we could implement locally or (preferably) buy a cloud solution. We don&#x27;t have big requirements so the software should (at least) be able to connect to our existing local ERP, to get customer and our products data, should support/have built-in RMA forms for customers to send us their RMA requests and get RMA progress updates (optionally some sort of barebone ticketing system or simply sending update e-mails) and have scheduled or ondemand reporting capability for our management (so we can identify products with most defects, what are those defects, etc.).
 We are not a big company with only around 50 employees, but have quite a few customers (we manufacture products for customers) so the software solution should be a reliable one.
 Thank you in advance for your recommendations!

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m keen on finding an RMM that can patch a large number of third-party Windows applications but also supports Mac or Linux agents for OS patching. We have looked at the following:
 ​
  
NinjaRMM - only 200+ third-party apps
 Atera - uses Chocolatey/Homebrew catalog, which I&#x27;m unsure about
 ManageEngine - has an impressive 1200+ catalog, but UI could use a refresh
  
I think the last two are good choices, but any other recommendations based off of my current requirements?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey all
 So I’m working on certificate based authentication for our Wifi network. We currently have a policy which looks at an AD group and grants access passing through credentials.
 I’ve created a NPS policy for the certificate and in the logs I can see that’s working as intended.
 The catch is when a user does not have a certificate / isn’t part of the AD group they can still authenticate with their credentials. Do I need to add a Deny rule in? I can’t see the user in the logs at this point either.
 Send help!

                              <span>So my company finally has a IT board with us and the decision makers (lawfirm). We wanted Intune or a similar solution so we can finally move away from having to type in a users password (especially if they already work for us) and setup the laptop manually. Got rejected for it being too expensive for everyone. On my question on how we should move forward with this as setting up laptops manually takes a lot of time, time which we could use for productive work, they told us to just hire students.
 This will be fun when we up our workforce by roughly a third this year and have them all start working on the same day. This will totally work and we will totally won&#x27;t have issues with this approach, because giving some random students laptops with little to no possible oversight who are doing a brain-dead task will work out.
 So any ideas on other solutions? We will have to deploy devices on a regular basis for all offices and a person having to wait 1-2 business days to work again (us shipping them a device from HQ or in that office a student being there setting up a device) is not an option

                              <span>I am currently looking at both Vijilan and IBM QRadar for a large environment to replace an existing legacy AV product (1000+ devices). I am trying to get concrete information rather than FUD (Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt) about both products. I am familiar with the capabilities of both products and have seen a live extended demo for both with physical test devices. 
 Specifics:
 Any issues with Client communication / agent upgrades?
 The CS Agent is lightweight for CPU (2%) and Memory (40MB - 140MB typical)
 Any issues with CPU/Memory utilization getting driven up high?
 What&#x27;s your experience been in post-sales support?
 Any other significant issues I should know?

                              <span>What&#x27;s people&#x27;s thoughts on how best to manage email signatures in an org? Seems there are many ways to skin the cat, all with their nuances.. Exchange Online /365 environment. (+Intune)
 The requirement is to standardize/centralize it, but allow users to edit to their specific details (if required).
 Seems copy/paste of a template seems to stump many users, and sometimes the images don&#x27;t paste correctly? People then seem to make up their own crap.
 Do people use transport rules and AAD attributes? Can you use images with those? I&#x27;d imagine with TRs, there&#x27;s no room for any of those people who the standard template wouldn&#x27;t suit..?
 For signatures that reference external hosted images, do they run risk of not loading/displaying on the recipients email client?
 3rd party tool?
 Local PowerShell script? But then is it per user or machine?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a systems engineer for a national healthcare company. We recently decom&#x27;d a data center and used a company to relocate a piece of hardware to another one of our datacenters several states away, and used a second company to take away the remaining old decom&#x27;d hardware that we no longer needed.
 I&#x27;ve handled nearly all of the quoting, selections, and coordination during this process. On the day for both companies to perform their duties, it was just a disaster. Neither company should&#x27;ve had the problems that they had, putting us in situations we shouldn&#x27;t have had to be in. This is not the first time I&#x27;ve dealt with bad IT recycling companies...
 It got me thinking and throwing an idea around with a couple of friends. One, an owner of a small trucking company, and another who&#x27;s a CPA and a part-time small business owner. We&#x27;re thinking of forming an IT relocation, destruction, and recycling company.
 What issues have you had dealing with these companies? What kind if services are you looking for in such a company? Are you looking for such a company to quickly and simply haul away your old equipment, or do you have equipment of value that you no longer need, and want to have such a company pay some for it to be able to resell? Do you only care about certificates of destruction? Do you want said company to do all the labor, un-racking all your old gear and handle the entire decom/relocation process, or simply have them pick up the already removed hardware, ready to go at the dock? What&#x27;s most important to you? If quotes of two companies were identical, what would make you choose one over the other? 
 It seems like there&#x27;s a lot of players in the industry, but I haven&#x27;t had a company provide these services without throwing wrenches into the works. To err is human, but a lot of the mistakes and issues I&#x27;ve seen are completely avoidable. I can do better.
 You wanna talk me out of it? Why? You wanna talk me into it? Why?

                              <span>In Australia, the award (effectively minimum employment conditions) that covers tech workers is updated with formalised work times of 38 hours between 6am to 10pm week days, with minimum overtime rates outside those hours. There&#x27;s stuff for Time Off In Lieu, and exemptions for those earning over 25% in excess of award rates (which would include most senior people or those in high cost-of-living locations).

                              <span>I&#x27;ve recently discovered M365 has the ability to monitor OneDrive sync status of devices. I have created an Intune policy and deployed to our devices but ive got a few queries for anyone using it.
 1) Does it take 3 days for it to sync up so i see it in the dashboard? The documnetation says up to 3 days but is it usually quicker?
 2) Is there anyway to get an email notification when there&#x27;s errors? If it works as expected and shows if a user isn&#x27;t syncing if there was a way to be notified it&#x27;d be great

                              <span>So the place I just started at a few months ago made their &quot;decree&quot; - no more remote work.
 I&#x27;m trying to decide whether or not I should even bother trying to have the conversation with someone in upper management that at least two of their senior people are about to GTFO because there&#x27;s no need for them to be in the office. Managers, I get it - they should be there since they need to chat with people and be a face to management. Sysadmin and netadmin and secadmin under them? Probably not unless they&#x27;re meeting a vendor, need to be there for a meeting with management, or need to do something specific on-site.
 I could see and hear in this morning&#x27;s meeting that some people instantly checked the fuck out. I think that the IT Manager missed it or is just hoping to ignore it.
 They already have positions open that they haven&#x27;t staffed. I wonder why they think this will make it better.

                              <span>Hey sysadmins - I want to see if this is something widespread - I am a security engineer (from India working for a US based MSSP) - recently was on a call with a counterpart from the US - it was a late night / early morning Change and we had completed the work and waiting for the servers to come back up - the conversation went to outsourcing work to companies that gets offshore teams from India and the abysmal performance or really bad experience they have had with the said teams 
 It went along the lines of the engineers don’t really trust them - but their management has outsourced it and they are just doing what they are being told! When i told this might not be widespread- i was asked to post this here :)
 Do you guys think this is something that you guys see all the time? 
 I am from India and i am curious to “revert back” to my colleague…

 I saw this random blog on LinkedIn (Nothing more than what I just mentioned, no need to click) and got suprised.

 So if you have been following my post you will know about the fight for porting numbers I have been in. 
 Well ATT rep for our company has been more than help these last 6.5 months. He has provided all the info and then some that we need. However some of our numbers still are being rejected. The rep had tried everything except dogging back to when att took control of our previous sip vendor (without a date, time etc.) from the sound of it and recommends new numbers.
 But management still is not budging and we are back at tracing the numbers and circuits. To the point it is interfering with my after work home life and me studying for my degree.
 I am more than done with project and desperately please for any ideas.
 Back story for those who don&#x27;t know

I&#x27;m wanting everyone to use OneDrive to back up their files but users are not following directions (as usual) so now I&#x27;m looking to force it. We do use MFA and so I was told I couldn&#x27;t do this just as a script to push out to their machines. I do have a way to push out scripts and programs to their machiens using a RMM tool. Please tell me there&#x27;s a powershell script I can use to make this happen.

                              <span>We are potentially looking at windows hello for business to enable passwordless sign on. Our environment is a hybrid AD/Azure AD and due to the nature of our business we will likely remain that way for a long time. Our users are already logging in with smartcard but we are looking for something a little more modern. 
 With smartcard login already established we have all of the PKI, DC, and other pre-reqs in place for the key trust method. It seems like enabling this would be as simple as adding the Azure AD user to the Key admins group, and enabling the GPO on a few test accounts. 
 Reading through the docs i see MS is now heavily pushing the cloud trust method over the key trust. The big driver is simplicity without the needs for all the PKI and other setup. 
 Sometimes what MS pushes is whats best for them and not for the customer. So what are your thoughts with the existing PKI in place if you were doing a new WHfB setup would you go key trust or cloud trust. 
 Thanks

                              <span>When Microsoft Teams start before the network (Eg. with captive portal authentication), Microsoft Teams start in Offline mode.
 When we get internet connectivity, Teams go online and the user status get updated (available) and see also the status of other company users.
 At that time, if we receive a call (Teams to Teams or outside call), we don&#x27;t get any notification and the caller is directly redirected to his voicemail.
 The user has set the option to &quot;Calls ring me&quot;, &quot;Also ring&quot; to &quot;No One Else&quot; and If unanswered to voicemail after 20 seconds (default).
 To be able to receive a call, we have to call someone or close completely Teams and restart with internet connectivity.
 We opened a support ticket at Microsoft and they answered that it is by design and we should remove the option &quot;Auto-start application&quot; which is set by default and wait to have internet connectivity before starting Teams.
 Does it make sense to you ? Do you also encounter the problem ? Do you have a solution ?

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Quick one, has anyone got experience with a good product for multiple staff members to remotely access only 1 or 2 machines from onsite/remote with both PCs and mobiles? Found out staff have been using a single TeamViewer account and Chrome Remote desktop via a single email to connect to these machines as they run status software for production. 
 Wanting to be able to add a layer of visibility and security from the IT side. Mainly being able to restrict users that are able to access, block access after leaving and also auditing whos connected to the machine. TeamViewer would work but it&#x27;s expensive and they&#x27;re an absolutely terrible vendor to deal with, any other ones also seem to be focused on both high user and machine count so ends up being too pricy.
 Anyone used anything they could recommend? Thank you

                              <span>Hey Reddit! 
 I am an internal IT at one of the companies here in Estonia. We are quite understaffed so we need to always be dealing with issues I don’t feel 100% comfortable with. 
 I want some suggestions courses or a little roadmap. 
 I’m looking for MS services.
 Mainly: Azure administration Microsoft domain administration Windows administration I’m solid with powrshell but would like to learn more too. 
 Though the company I have subscription to Pluralsight but I haven’t really used this before so unsure what quality courses there are. 
 Any suggestions will be appreciated!

 What’s the command for listing and deleting Azure AD accounts locally off a computer?
 To be clear, I’m not trying to delete anything from the cloud. Just if for example, there’s a computer which would be used by multiple users, and if older users would have to be deleted due to them taking drive space that needs to be freed.

 I&#x27;m looking for a remote patch mgmt software solution. Basically, keeping local and remote devices (mostly win server and linux ubuntu/centos) up to date. I&#x27;m not looking for a full RMM, just basic OS patching, preferably a cloud solution with remote agents. I&#x27;m currently looking at:
  
Manageengine patch management plus pro
 Automox
 Sanernow
  
Any other names I should definitely take a look at?
 Thanks

                              <span>Bitwarden has mostly repeated their claim that the data is protected with 200,001 PBKDF2 iterations: 100,001 iterations on the client side and another 100,000 on the server. This being twice the default protection offered by LastPass, it doesn’t sound too bad. 
 Except: as it turns out, the server-side iterations are designed in such a way that they don’t offer any security benefit. What remains are 100,000 iterations performed on the client side, essentially the same iteration protection level as for LastPass until only a few days ago when they upped the iterations to 350,000 for newly created accounts.

                              <span>I posted about KeyDB, a multi-threaded fork of Redis, here already a while ago. We still use it in some cases and find it beneficial.
 Here are technical details about our other recent migration from Redis. Briefly, we became limited by the per-core performance of the new CPUs, and KeyDB proved to be an easy-to-use drop-in replacement (removing a performance bottleneck we were struggling with).
 On the other hand, it is quite a specific case and related to our willingness to minimise migration efforts (instead of using sharding, etc.). It would be interesting to see other experiences.

 Has anyone successfully retired they’re onprem exchange server? All our mailboxes are already Office365 hosted. Nearest I can tell it’s only synchronising Active Directory changes and distribution groups. Is there anything else I should be looking out for? What’s the process of decommissioning the server?

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 Please excuse my limited knowledge.. I&#x27;m working for an editor who offers his app through RemoteApp on Windows Server 2019.
 This software generates Excel reports (through data injection in templates). When we set up those machines a few months ago, I&#x27;m 99% positive that, with no Excel installed on the server, when we generated an Excel file, the local Excel (on the users machine) was used. Today, this isn&#x27;t the case anymore. Users connect to this RemoteApp through RDP.
 Would you know what I can edit to achieve this? Or is it just me who don&#x27;t remeber correctly?

                              <span>First big mistake in the industry after 5 years being in this company.
 Long story short, I deleted a keyvault in Azure which was used by a production DB server to encrypt the databases. The keyvault did not have the soft delete feature as it was an &quot;old&quot; one, the feature was not enabled by default back then.
 Now the database is completely impossible to recover as the backup are also encrypted. We effectively have lost 4 years worth of data give or take.
 I don&#x27;t know what will happen to me yet, I know that my boss is pissed off, the CTO is pissed off, and I am pissed off at myself lol.
 How do you cope with those kind of situations ?
 Details : 
 Just giving some context as to why I deleted the fucking keyvault. It had a funny name (not standard at all), with only one key, the key had the name of a server that was deleted since 2020. Turns out the DBA used the same key to encrypt the server that replaced it. 
 As I was trying to clean up our Azure subscriptions, because we have tons of unused resources, I thought this one was safe to delete.
 I immediediatly enabled both soft delete and purge protection for all our keyvaults after this mistake.

                              <span>We offer SAAS, and as part of the package the client can have a number of users trained on the system.
 During Covid this was done via Zoom, which was great as I could even do it from home if required, and it worked really well for both the clients and us.
 However, my boss is now insisting on dragging the clients into our office for an hour or more - for no reason other than &quot;I want them to see our office...&quot;
 I need to emphasise that for the type of system we operate, there is absolutely no advantage to this. It just means someone will be looking over my shoulder at a screen, rather than me sharing it right to their laptop via {insert video call provider here}

 I just noticed that my client&#x27;s desktop folder is moved into a folder inside desktop after the major microsoft incident. 
 This looks like a story for Dr. Who :) 
 It&#x27;s impossible to do that if you try to do, you can&#x27;t move desktop folder into a folder inside desktop if you try :))
 ​
 Anyone else experience anything similar?

                              <span>Hi Friends.
 I have been tasked to figure out why our on-premise GPO Password Policy isn&#x27;t synchronizing correctly towards the user who have been synced to Azure AD. 
 After having read countless blogs and Microsoft articles I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that it&#x27;s unfortunately NOT possible to synchronize the &quot;ms-DS-User-Dont-Expire-Password&quot; attribute to AAD.
 I know you can set the password to never expire for ALL users within the MS 365 Admin Center -&gt; Security &amp; Privacy tab.. But what if I only want specific user accounts to never expire? 
 So my question is rather, is it possible to somehow let on-premise AD handle the &quot;password never expires&quot; for Azure AD?
 ​
 Thank you all for your time :-)

                              <span>Hello,
 I have a task to migrate a Windows 2012 file server to a new Windows 2022 server. Most of the old folders I&#x27;ve move to AWS S3 glacier, but I have about 10TB of used data to migrate.
 I&#x27;ve tried 2 robocopy scripts and they skip so many files and folders. I&#x27;m using a domain admin account, but I see &quot;access denies&quot; and &quot;The requested operation could not be completed due to a file system limitation&quot;
 Here are what I&#x27;ve tried
 ROBOCOPY &quot;\\server123\folder&quot; &quot;E:\folder&quot; /copy:DATSOU /mir /mt:16 /R:0 /W:0 /np /XD DfsrPrivate &quot;.trashes&quot; /log:&quot;C:\Robocopy Scripts\server123.txt&quot; /v 
 and 
 ROBOCOPY &quot;\\server123\folder&quot; &quot;E:\Newcastle&quot; /mt:16 /E /ZB /XD DfsrPrivate &quot;.trashes&quot; &quot;.TemporaryItems&quot; /PURGE /COPYALL /b /R:0 /W:0 /NP /log:&quot;C:\Robocopy Scripts\server123.txt&quot; /v 
 This is just one folder I tested with so it&#x27;s quicker.

 It will be hard to give myself access to these millions of files as I&#x27;m sure that will cause issues, is there a robocopy method that will copy/mirror the source and copy to the destination and not worry about access permissions?

 I also have one of these: https://www.tradeinn.com/f/13786/137861931/dell-usb-c-gigabit-ethernet-adapter.jpg
 ​
 Is is possible to use this as some kind of network info-diagnostic tool like https://netool.io/ just with less features? is there drivers and software to do something like this on android?

                              <span>I&#x27;m going through our secure score for azure, and just wondering what everyone&#x27;s score is running at.
 Ours hovers between 75-80%. Just wondering if this is an OK score.

I&#x27;ve learned the basics of the job as a one man IT dep. and now I&#x27;m looking to grow, I just don&#x27;t know where to put my attention. I&#x27;m really interested by the DevOps figure, also knowing that the market is full of really good offers for this kind of job, but have little programming knowledge, I&#x27;m also interested in the cloud. What&#x27;s the best path one should follow to grow? What are the best job roles one should aspire to? Feel free to advice courses, learning path or documentation.

 I&#x27;m a bit more than a little biased... Newly biased that is. After using slack for several years and hipchat before that, and being purchased by a company that uses teams, and starting to use it, I was off the opinion that they were all the same and it doesn&#x27;t really matter what you use.
 Then I got on a project using teams.
 Holy hell. I can honestly say that the use of MS Teams is actively detrimental to the success of a project. You couldn&#x27;t come up with a worse tool even if you had it built by Hewlett Packard.

 Meraki is not helpful with this specific stack and switch set up sadly.

                              <span>I recently went into semi-retirement and moved from a consulting gig to a public college.
 I say &quot;semi-retirement&quot; because wow, the private and public sectors are crazy different. I took the huge pay hit, but started working somewhere really close to home, with a bunch of folks I like, and suddenly have people actually respecting my time off, be it a day or just after 5pm.
 I went from 60-80 hours a week and a big salary (not counting bonuses, SPIFs, and commissions) to making about half, but having more paid time off than I&#x27;ve ever had.
 I&#x27;m home at 5:05pm. Every night. Earlier if I jog.
 I drive my youngest kid to school in the morning, and pick them up after. My wife and I carpool again.
 I damn near killed myself for a lot of years, but I have savings for my youngest, and the others have finished their schooling.
 So, I quit the consulting in the Fortune 50 space and went to work at my local &quot;podunk&quot; school.
 Best decision ever.
 I took today off, and was invited to an important meeting by very high up folks.
 In my old life, I would have had to (at the least) find a way to call into the meeting.
 Today? Today they apologized for interrupting my time off. They put the notes from the meeting on my desk to review. 
 My direct supervisor texted and sent a Teams message telling me not to worry about the meeting.
 I feel like I&#x27;m in Europe. Yeah, the pay sucks, but the benefits are amazing. Medical is covered. Stupid low co-pays. Pension is set.
 I wish I could have done this sooner.

                              <span>Hey! I normally deal with Cisco and ubiquiti. So this is my first run in with sonicwall. Client of mine has an office for creative marketing and they have about 30 people in at a time using various applications(social media,Dropbox,zoom,google meets) they have a shared gigabit connection from isp and dedicated ethernet is not an option unfortunately. They are hard set on keeping the sonicwall and they haven’t been able to find anyone willing to configure it properly for them so I offered to check it out. The issue they are having is during peak time is buffering,web pages not loading etc… I took a look into there sonicwall and there is no bandwidth management configured at all. Just one CFS rule for default content filtering. My question is there a straight forward way to set up bandwidth profiles or a global rule to limit bandwidth for each user? My guess is out of the 30 users a few are uploading heavily to Dropbox and saturating the circuit.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in the IT field for around 25 years. I consider myself successful. I help to manage a global MPLS network [BGP/ISIS/OSPF] and I&#x27;m the resident wireless/ISE SME. The thing I struggle with is that I could be much better than I am. I don&#x27;t mean to suggest that I&#x27;m a poor employee, I get solid reviews every year.
 I guess it&#x27;s just that I know I could be a CCIE level person but I just can&#x27;t seem to squeeze that much effort out of myself. I study but it&#x27;s for a bit here and there. I maintain a decent knowledge base but I find it so hard to push myself. Does anyone here relate? How did you energize yourself to study hard and lab stuff up to really drive yourself to a high level?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hey all,
 I have a client that I am now the main IT personnel for, at a school, that needs VPN access using their Barracuda VPN Client.
 They can connect to the school.
 They get an IP Address, DNS Servers, and a DHCP server all listed.
 But they aren&#x27;t getting a Gateway from the CloudGen Firewall.
 I checked the settings, and there is definitely a Gateway listed. I tried setting the Gateway to the same address scheme of their DHCP service, and to the IP Address of the LAN DHCP service. Both times, ipconfig /all showed an empty space where the Gateway should be. 
 Anyone have any ideas why the Gateway wouldn&#x27;t show up at all?
 Thanks much!

                              <span>Hello, relatively new to networking stuff and was hoping to inquire about some network setup. My plan right now is to setup a managed switch as distribution from our router to a few different access switches. Does that seem logical?
 ​
 Also, writing this now, the internet comes from a main server switch that runs into a patch panel. Instead of: patch panel -&gt; router -&gt; switch should I do: patch panel -&gt; switch -&gt; router ?
 ​
 Also Also, switches would be on a budget by the company so can&#x27;t spend even more than a few hundred for a switch most likely, if my only options for a managed switch are ones in the high high price range.

                              <span>Hi all, recently the business I work for has been having frequent outages with our ISP. I have been asked to come up with a backup solution until the other ISP becomes available in the area. We got a 5G Business Hotspot from T-Mobile. Connection is great and we only have between 50-70 essential devices online at any given time. 
 We just received the router and I am reading up on how to configure it properly. I will do my best to list the relevant facts about our network.
 ​
 Firewall is running Cisco ASDM 7.14
 ISP comes in through modem, routes to firewall and then firewall plugs to our LAN via Network Switches
 A Physical Windows Server provides DHCP for the network
 Same server is our DC as well
 ​
 I am wondering what I have to configure on the firewall to make sure it will allow the Hotspot to give internet connection to our devices without messing with their IP&#x27;s or anything on the internal network.
 ​
 Maybe this is simpler than I am making it out to be and I just need to allow the external IP of the hotspot, disable DHCP on it then call it a day, but I&#x27;m not sure.
 They would also like me to configure it specifically just as a failover, so if the ISP goes down the firewall routes over to the hotspot automatically? But I am not sure if that is possible. Any help would be appreciated!

 Fortinet provides us a hosted list for Netflix and Disney+, unfortunately not for the others. Google helped a little but I wasn&#x27;t able to block everything yet. 
 I&#x27;d like to start a thread here for people to share their block lists.

With each new vulnerability and no patch will also increase the risk of this device but I need to figure out how to account for the failure probability first. Any help will be deeply appreciated.

 I know there exist 1.25/2.5/5/10G SFP+ RJ45 Copper Transceivers. If I use one in the MX450 will that give me a 5Gbps link to the BW320?

                              <span>So, many ISPs use L2TP PPP to connect their subscribers to their network. When looking into this, I see that CHAP authentication is often required. Is this pre-configured on the CPE or will the customer have to do some sort of login process? 
 Thanks for the help.

Things like guest networks, customers we provide internet access too, etc. id imagine this might be a concern in say a college campus where students are all bringing their own devices, and the college doesnt want people using outdated browsers while connected to their network.

                              <span>I started trying to use GNS3 for my CCNP studies in Security so I had to get ASAv images on there. Routers worked just fine without much issue but it took me a few months (on and off) of tweaking this and that and solving an insane amount of tiny little things for it to finally work, only for me to take my laptop somewhere else then bring it home and now the networking portion is all messed up and wonky again
 I tried EVE NG recently and I love how they have a bunch more Cisco options and it&#x27;s easier to get the images but man, none of them work aside from maybe a router. After a bunch of tweaking I finally got a WSA to turn on and that&#x27;s it. I&#x27;ve been trying for days just to get a freakin L2 switch on there. Thought I finally got one only to have the image be a router. Tweaked one thing and now it won&#x27;t even turn on. I have to try getting experience on firepower and FMC and followed Rob Rikers tutorial on it and some of the EVE commands in the shell don&#x27;t even work.
 I&#x27;ve spent i don&#x27;t know how many months just trying to get a single dang simulator to work and it&#x27;s been nothing short of a soul sucking experience. Wondering if I&#x27;m just an outlier here...

                              <span>I&#x27;ve set up a new NPS server using ESP-TLS for authentication. RADIUS clients are Unifi access points. Clients that have a certificate are authenticating on to the network fine however Event Viewer on the NPS server is full of the following error: 
 Event ID 14 - A RADIUS message was received from RADIUS client with an invalid authenticator. This is typically caused by mismatched shared secrets. Verify the configuration of the shared secret for the RADIUS client in the Network Policy Server snap-in and the configuration of the network access server.
 I&#x27;ve made sure the shared secrets match by creating a template then copying and pasting directly into the AP controller. I&#x27;ve also tried with a shortened shared secret in case it was an issue with it being too long (didn&#x27;t think this would be the case as clients authenticate fine but worth a try) and rebooting the NPS server (after reading online this had sorted it for someone else).
 Any ideas what is causing this? On average there is an error logged every few seconds (30 ish RADIUS clients)

Individual Node AP 
 AP national coverage (combined with IPsC CP handover option)
  
Am I correct in saying that the individual node charge is for each 21C nodes?
 And that AP national coverage with IPsC CP handover option is just WBMC? 
 Thanks for the help!

Are there any show commands in Cisco or Juniper to see what bgp routes advertised/received after filtering applied with show bgp command for example?

                              <span>Hello all,
 Was wondering about MLAG configuration on Mellanox HPE switches.
 So I have two firewalls and two switches, they will be configured as MLAG.
 I found documentation on how to configure the MLAG: 
 https://enterprise-support.nvidia.com/s/article/how-to-configure-mlag-on-mellanox-switches
 One thing I noticed is that the IPL link between the switches (I think IPL is equivalent to vPC in the Nexus world, but please correct me if I’m wrong) is that they do not trunk the traffic between the switches compared to Nexus switches. Here is a direct link to IPL configuration: https://enterprise-support.nvidia.com/s/article/how-to-configure-mlag-on-mellanox-switches#jive_content_id_IPL
 Why is that? In the documentation, for IPL, it says that all: “All VLANs are open on this port. There is no need to configure that, as once an interface is mapped as IPL all the VLANs are open on this port”. 
 Does that mean that it is already a trunk port between switches that run IPL and there is no need for me to trunk the port-channel between the switches?
 This is my first time ever have my hands on with Mellanox switches, so I’m a little bit unsure how this really works. 
 Appreciate all your help.

                              <span>My company is running phishing simulations (via third party) and every time a user clicks on a simulation link, we receive a high severity alert in our O365 console. The alert is obviously a false positive and states &quot;A high-severity alert has been triggered. A potentially malicious URL click was detected&quot;.
 Screenshot of the alert: https://i.imgur.com/2A3BOBl.png
 A description of the alert states:
  
Generates an alert when a user protected by Safe Links in your organization clicks a malicious link. This alert is generated when a user clicks on a link and this event triggers a URL verdict change identification by Microsoft Defender for Office 365. It also checks for any clicks in the past 48 hours from the time the malicious URL verdict is identified, and generates alerts for the clicks that happened in the 48-hour timeframe for that malicious link. This alert automatically triggers automated investigation and response in Office 365. For more information on events that trigger this alert, see Set up Safe Links policies. 
  
We&#x27;ve configured Safe Links to bypass the domains and IP&#x27;s of the phishing simulations but the alert still triggers. We are wondering if there is a way to bypass this alert for our simulations, but not our regular emails. It&#x27;s a default policy under threat management alert policies so it cannot be edited. 
 Any assistance is appreciated.

                              <span>My management expects IT to be omnipotent. I got in trouble for an issue today. According to management, there was a network issue. After investigating on my end, It turns out a director could not get on to zoom. They did not report this to anyone in IT. They told another director and the director complained.
 ​
 What is the recommended way to deal with this type of stuff?

                              <span>We have an old Netapp, it&#x27;s end of life this month -- NetApp won&#x27;t sell us a support contract.
 We&#x27;re migrating away from NetApp to Azure, and while doing so, we stepped in it big..
 Client had not updated their domain controllers in several years, since before the kerberos/schannel changes in 2021
 After we updated domain controllers by applying windows updates, CIFS broke on our netapp ONTAP 8 units
 ​
 We&#x27;ve spent 3 days working without any help from Netapp -- i put in a pleading call to their sales with amex in hand asking for any sort of assistance to get this system online long enough for us to migrate away from it.
 ​
 I&#x27;m right now facing an issue regarding CIFS &amp; netlogon 0xc000022
 Vfiler unable to authenticate due to denied access to CIFS server machine account in Active Directory - NetApp Knowledge Base 
 ​
 I think I get the gist of the article, thanks to the community forms that I do have access to.. &quot;delete and recreate the AD account&quot; -- and I think i know how to do this -- but I&#x27;d love to read the full article to see if any additional steps are required.
 ​
 I&#x27;ll save my growing rant regarding paywalled kb articles for later..

                              <span>I hope this helps someone, we have been running down this very very frustrating path for awhile now. At first I did not believe it was isolated to the new machines our support team was deploying (Latitude 3310) but we have confirmed that to be the case.
 Issue: Users were reporting that during the day Outlook would become disconnected and refuse to re-establish connectivity without rebooting the device. Teams would also have similar issues. A reboot &quot;fixed&quot; it for a couple hours. In the AAD logs token refreshes were failing with server/proxy couldn&#x27;t be found, so I was tracking that down believing it to be related.
 Resolution: I was in the office for the first time in awhile and went to one of our employees reporting this issue as well. I noticed his CPU fan was running non stop, and that really irritates me, so I found the service consuming it which ended up being part of the Dell Optimizer suite. This is &quot;Intelligent AI-based features automatically fine-tune your PC for the best possible connection, audio and performance.&quot; NOPE, it sure isn&#x27;t.
 Dell has a feature called &quot;Express Connect&quot; which seems to try and do some QoS style shaping but in real world simply causes nothing but issues. After uninstalling Dell Optimizer and its service (you need to do both) these issues have disappeared.
 TL;DR: Dell Optimizer does nothing to optimize and in fact causes issues that you&#x27;ll be pulling your hair out on for awhile. Uninstall it and its service.
 ​
 Edit: After KNOWING the issue was Dell Optimizer I am able to locate countless reddit posts about the issue. I almost feel like we need some sort of KB of known trash. We don&#x27;t reimage these because they are Intune/Autopilot machines going to random sites.

                              <span>Hey /r/sysadmin,
 I&#x27;ve built a little cron editing tool with support for multiple crons.
 👉 https://tool.crontap.com/cronjob-debugger/multiple.
 For those of us still writing cronjobs I hope this can come in handy. I write them infrequent enough to not be able to visualise a few jobs at a time in my head.
 CronTool has been built together with the Reddit r/programmer community and it got a few novel features that (to my knowledge) you can&#x27;t find anywhere else. To start, there&#x27;s a view that allows you to visualise multiple cron jobs - or if you wish: your entire crontab file on a calendar!
 Many of the common crons need 2 or more cron jobs defined, for example:
 Run a cron at two different set times. e.g. I want a cron to run twice daily, at 8:30am and 11:30pm:
 30 8 * * * 30 23 * * * 
 (link)
 Run a cron every 15 minutes throughout the day except at 3AM:
 */15 0-2,4-23 * * * 15-45/15 3 * * * 
 (link)
 There is finally a good way to have an overview other those and I hope you&#x27;ll find this useful too.
 Compared to existing online cron job editor, there are a few things this one can do:
  
✅ (obviously) calendar view
 ✅ support for L, W &amp; LW values
 ✅ optional support for seconds &amp; years
 ✅ support for the ? value
 ✅ support for the # value
 ✅ more help &amp; documentation for first timers. Q/A with examples that need multiple crons, for example this one
 ✅ support for debugging multiple crons at once (see above)
  
Thanks for reading!

                              <span>I bought a HP Laserjet Printer (I‘m a small Reseller / MSP) for a customer. He just needed the Printer in the hall to copy documents. Nothing else, no print no scan.
 So a went and bought the cheapest lasterprinter available, set it up and it worked.
 Little did i know, there are printers which require HP+ to work. So after 15 copies the printer stopped working. Short troubleshooting, figured I‘ll create a HP Account, connect it to the WLAN, Problem solved…
 Not with HP. Spent 3 Hours this morning to setup the printer and nothing worked. Now a called HP after resetting everything.
 Technician tells me, that thers a known Problem with their servers, and it should be fixed by tomorrow.
 How hard can it be, to sell Printers that just work, and to build a big red flag on the support page, that shows there is a Problem!
 I will never sell a HP Device again!

 we got a spam mail trying to capture the password, e-mail &amp; IP-address.
 When looking at the HTML code the attacker has his plain API token inside incl. the template he got it from.
 What can you do to mess around with it? Should I just report it to telegram (telegram bot sends /message to the recipient)?

 There’s hardly any documentation and the little that I do have is so old I might as well say I have none. I have a general logical diagram for the network that is current but otherwise nothing. This is going to be a bear to tackle, any recommendations on where to go from here ?

                              <span>I work in a volunteer org that is finally coming into the computer age. My team has been tasked with seeing up the physical infrastructure, as well as all the software and communications. 
 I finally lost it yesterday after the president told me that I was to revert some changes only because he didn&#x27;t understand them.
 I woke up to a message this morning from him saying he&#x27;d gone in and made changes himself.
 I lost it. Didn&#x27;t name call or swear but I did speak to his lack of qualifications and that he has to ask before he does. He&#x27;s now demanding that he be given admin rights.
 How would you guys deal with this?

 With IT it’s constantly well we could use this tool, but haven’t, so don’t spend money on this to fix it. 
 Senior staff it’s like okay, but don’t roll it out to me, because I might be inconvenienced. 
 Or they hamstring me by denying a small-dollar item to make everything go smoother with user acceptance.
 Edit: I’m taking a second masters degree on their dime, so I’m stuck for the time being.

I am looking for a .bat, ps1, .vbs, or really any kind of script I can run as a post install task to force a scan, download, and install of Windows updates then force restart if needed. 
 I was using a .vbs script with my Win 10 images and that worked fine but Win 11 does not seem to like the script as it only scans and never downloads or installs.

                              <span>Hello sysadmins, junior admin here,
 The company i&#x27;m working for wants to have every user registered to for MFA. Around 300 users. Company made the choice to also push toward Windows Hello (since we mainly use laptops and one per user). We have hybrid azure with on-prem ad, laptops are not yet Intune enrolled but are azure ad joined. Windows hello tested and it works. Also company don&#x27;t want to &quot;force&quot; user to use personnal phone (app/number) so we plan to use TAP when users don&#x27;t want to.
 We planned to help user enable windows hello using TAP/sms/app. Conditional access wil not ask for MFA when on premise (by ip) so it would be only when accessing cloud apps from home.
 But when i test it with windows hello enabled, when challenged for mfa, i can&#x27;t chose windows hello as a method, Microsoft asks for me to register a MFA method (and redirect me to only authenticator app which annoys me since users can&#x27;t chose SMS if they want)
 Any idea or best practice on how to achieve that ? Thank you, sorry if my english is a bit off

                              <span>Hi all, bashing my head with this one. Started new role as IT manager and one area I&#x27;m focusing on is revamping Intune completely. There is a linked Google play account that was set up by the prior MSP who we are unable to contact due to ongoing legal issues.
 I have the account password and previous password but not to the number linked to the account, which is crazy why a mobile number is forced rather than OTP. All account recovery options just fail because of this one single personal mobile number.
 Tried going through support reps and chats just to be told there&#x27;s nothing they can do and to &quot;just create a new one&quot;.. which means unenrolling every single Android device... Even though I can prove full tenant ownership, account ownership, can give or create proof of identity but nope. All the same crappy responses from the same script every single time.
 Does anyone know how in earth to speak to someone with a conscience at Google? It doesn&#x27;t paint them in a good light if that&#x27;s the only option and they can&#x27;t help despite situations like these happen in business a lot. It&#x27;s a shame there&#x27;s not a question/rant flair!

                              <span>I work for a Housing Association. Being really lazy - got to build 8 PC&#x27;s for tenants, which need to be locked down. I&#x27;m going to be using Deep Freeze to wipe each one down after use, but want to create a some local user policies in the base image. MDT is probably a bit excessive for deployment, so I was planning on creating a snap shot of a PC set up and using Rufus to create a bootable disk. The lazy part is creating a GPO &quot;template&quot; for the guest user, I was wondering if anyone had one that I could work from. The security/access level would be the same as a library or school.

                              <span>Wondering if anyone out there has used software restriction policies successfully to prevent users from installing into their App Data folder? I had a user install some bloatware since they can install to their user instance only by default. I would like to prevent this. It looks like SRPs can be used for this, but I am wondering if it actually works well? I would like to &quot;allow list&quot; apps only.

                              <span>Last week a customer called me because  they needed to install a brand new milling/grinding/IDK machine.
 The producer (german) gave them a form to fill with the network parameters for this brand new top of the line (way more expensive than a villa) machine. Filling the form I was skeptical.
 IP Address: 
 Mask: 
 Gateway: 
 DNS: 
 WINS: 
 I thought of a &quot;someone forgot to delete that row in a 20 years old document, maybe?&quot; and I left that row blank.
 Fast forward to , I go to the customer and they were assembling a huge machine that does all sort of  things.
 And they really needed a WINS server to communicate with the software installed on the management server. They cannot connect by IP address, they cannot resolve names using DNS, they really needed a WINS server.
 Obviously the guy assembling and installing the machine knew EVERYTHING about 
 and absolutely nothing about what an IP address is. He only knew &quot;how to insert those parameters in this window&quot;.
 He gave me access to the operating system of the monitor controlling that machine. Windows CE 5.
 I had to install and configure (well, only one record) a WINS server... in 2023.

                              <span>I had my first real life encounter with the 2038 bug this week. The situation was caused by a program we have that queries a domain registration API based on expiration date ranges. I had set it to query up to 15 years in the future (even though I know domains can only be registered up to 10 years in the future ... I wrote this thing 20 years ago so I don&#x27;t remember why I added the extra 5).
 Anyway, 15 years from Jan 23, 2023 (calculated naively as 15 * 365) is Jan 19, 2038. So starting yesterday my query was breaking the API (internal error). The owners of the API identified the problem pretty quickly and confirmed it&#x27;s the 2038 problem. I changed to query only 10 years in the future and they&#x27;ve now got 5 years to fix it
 I suspect we&#x27;ll start seeing more of these random discoveries every January, with spikes in 2028 and 2033. Hopefully I&#x27;m right in thinking most of the problem code will just get naturally replaced in the next 15 years, but I know I&#x27;ve got a couple of old databases in production that will have to be fixed before then.

                              <span>Currently, we&#x27;re only including the Upstream device Hostname and the word &quot;Uplink&quot;  Uplink in our Interface descriptions. But I&#x27;ve been thinking about expanding this to include more L1 Information that easily gets lost in Diagrams and Spreadsheets.
 Some ideas:
  
Fibre patch lead connector type (e.g. lc/sc)
 Fibre patch lead tip (APC/UPC) [Optional, default would be UPC]
 Patch lead length (e.g. 3m)
 Horizontal Fibre type (e.g. om3, os2)
 Patch Panel location (e.g. -#RU)
  
The description would look something like this:
 
 Uplink - pl&#x3D;lc-sc-om4, tip&#x3D;upc-upc, len&#x3D;3m, hz&#x3D;om3, loc&#x3D;BB1-RU21 
 From the above, I can quickly tell that there is a 3m LC/SC OM4 UPC patch lead connected from $this device to BB1-RU21 which is a Horizontal run of OM3. 
 This could also be collapsed into a shorter form like:
 
 Uplink - pl&#x3D;lc-sc-upc-upc-3m-om4, hz&#x3D;om3, loc&#x3D;BB1-RU21 
 Does anyone think this is overloading the description of an Interface with excessive L1 Information? Should we be pulling this out into something like Netbox (We currently have no roadmap for Netbox). Or should be collapsed down into a Link ID and stored outside of the device configuration?
 Benefits I see:
  
Information is close to the hardware, less likely chance of being sprawled into Documentation that doesn&#x27;t get an update
 
This information is presented directly in our alerts when the link goes down
 
No need to bring multiple different Patch-Leads to a job if the link goes down. Correct leads and connectors, each time.
 
 If you&#x27;re doing this, would you mind sharing your standard?

                              <span>I have a very frustrating issue. Some of the computers on our network are not able to access network shares using the hostname of the server. DNS is working and is able to resolve the correct IP address for the hostname. 
 This same computer will be able to access the network share using the IP address or the DNS Alias name of the server. The DNS Alias name will resolve to the correct hostname and IP address.
 I&#x27;ve confirmed that the (4) Domain Controllers/DNS Servers are replicating without errors with &quot;repadmin /replsummary&quot;.
 I&#x27;m hoping someone can point me in the right direction for a solution.

                              <span>I have a isco atalyst 3750 with 2 devices on VLAN 183 on it on port 0/1 and 0/2. Device on 0/1 is sending unregistered multicast traffic at IP 224.0.0.200 with a destination MAC of 01:00:5e:00:00:c8. Device on 0/2 can not see the multicast traffic. Is there a way with Catalyst switches to allow unregistered multicast to flood, or at least specify it to be allowed to go to 0/2?
 Steps I took
  
Disabled IGMG snooping globally on the switch
 Enabled IGMP snooping, and enabled the igmp querier
  
When I connect the devices to another switch of a different manufacturer, with the correct config, it works without issue.
 This solution might be similar on how to get mDNS to work correctly on a Catalyst 3750.
 Thank you for the help in advance.

                              <span>For those who use Firemon, Algosec or any other firewall rule review commercial tool, has your team had success in finding an open source alternative or a tool built in-house to perform basic firewall rule reviews before moving to those solutions ? To be more specific, for Palo alto firewalls. And do you think if you had the time and resources, would your have favored the approach of a simple tool built by your team or you think this could have had limitations. I am interested to hear your thoughts.

                              <span>We have a school that is occasionally maxing out a 1Gb connection from their ISP. ISP tells us that two 1Gb connections will be significantly more affordable than the single 2Gb connection they offer. This initially seemed great because we have 1 group of traffic we want to use one of the connections and 1 group of traffic we want to use the other connection. ISP is using GPON and I suspect they will give me an IP address for the second connection that is in the same subnet as the IP for the first connection and thus would have the same gateway. Most PBR scenarios I&#x27;ve seen set the next-hop IP based on the source network, but in this case the next-hop IP would be the same for both connections. Firewall at school is an ASA 5516-X. I initially preferred to use just a single firewall, but I do have some extra 5506-X I could deploy if necessary, recognizing the 5506-X won&#x27;t do the full 1Gb. I&#x27;m not completely familiar with GPON, but perhaps I could request the second connection have an IP in a different subnet? 
 Thinking a bit further, the school ASA in question currently has a VPN tunnel back to the datacenter ASA. I assume the school ASA is not going to establish a VPN tunnel to the datacenter from both of its IP Addresses, so I assume this is where a default route would come in and all traffic from both school subnets that need to traverse VPN tunnel would use the default route?

When I set these up I didn&#x27;t configure anything special, they just worked. Was in the config looking to clean some old port channels up and was wondering if I needed anything else in here for the AP ports. 
 This is all on a single default vlan, nothing else special. What should I be putting on these ports config wise if anything?

 i had a preconception as you cannot do a thing in ingress but police down if a customer buys 3gbps and wants a single 10gbps cable... and regardless how much burst you allow, if they&#x27;re on a different platform or anything, you have a good chance that your and their side will not agree on the measured interval, when to start it, and the amount of bytes allowed during that period before you restart counting, so you&#x27;ll drop some packets... pretty normal imho, nothing to see here...
 but back to the experiment: so i have a 10gbps homenet and an 1gbps/300gbps ftth, a…</span>

                              <span>In the near future I will get the task to renew the network hardware in the data center. So far we have two N5k with four N2k each as fabric extender in use. The two N5k are configured as vPc peers. Virtual machines and servers are connected with vpc to two different fabric extenders each, in order to create a failsafe and to be able to perform ISSU updates without interruption.
 We plan to replace the N5k with slightly &quot;larger&quot; Nexus 9300 and the N2K with slightly &quot;smaller&quot; Nexus 9300 as fabric extenders.
 Now there are three possibilities from my point of view:
  
 ⁠Rebuild the current design(Fex mode)
  
8 N9k 9300 are driven in FEX mode (like it’s described here https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/93x/fex/configuration/guide/b-cisco-nexus-2000-nx-os-fabric-extender-configuration-guide-for-nexus-9000-switches-93x/m-software-fex-mode-configuration.html) . 
 Two 9300 form a vpc domain and each of the two gets four fabric extenders assigned.
  
new topology: collapsed core (all standalone with back to back vpc)
  
2.1 Layer 2 only with back to back vpc 
 The two slightly larger 9300 models form the core layer (N9K_1 + N9K_2 )vpc domain 1 ).
 The access layer consists of 9300 pairs (N9K_3/4/5/6 + N9K_7/8/9/10 &#x3D; vpc domain 2,3,4,5). These 4 pairs are then bound to the core layer with vpc.
 So every Access pair has a uplink to N9K_1 and one uplink to N9K_2
 2.2 layer 3 HSRP at aggression vpc connected with always 2 pair of Switches in VPC as access to keep up the portchannels on two switches for servers. 
  
VXLAN spine and leaf 
  
Maybe there are some more possibilities, then please tell me. What would you choose?

                              <span>Hi, I have a hypothetical question for the time being. What is the sensible way to approach implementing a hotel wifi guest network where every room has a wired smart tv and the guest has to have access only to the inroom TV and no other TVs.
 The way I assume its done is by creating a vlan per room and adding a TV per vlan. On the wifi part configuring radius authentication and assigning different passwords for the different vlans, so when a client authenticates he ends up in the proper vlan.
 The thing is that this doesn&#x27;t really seem very scalable to me. For small properties it seems manageable, but considering that there are hotels with 500+ rooms it seems little excessive to configure 500+ vlans across every switch (because of wifi roaming).
 What am I missing or this is the way it is done?

                              <span>Right now our small school district of 775 students and faculty use a 1 Gig Symmetrical Fiber connection for about $1,200 a month. There are plenty of times during the day we use most of the bandwidth. Right now Comcast is running new lines in the area, and they are offering a Static IP 2 Gig Down / 200 Mbps Up Coax Broadband connection for about $400 a month. They are actually running fiber to the node then coax from the node to the main building. Should I swap over for this great pricing deal or would we be better with sticking to what we have for almost three times the price?

 The application is ducting fiber from a pair of top of rack fiber switches to server ports on the back. 
 I am aware of the AFI option but that has it&#x27;s own challenges and problems.

                              <span>Hey,
 Currently, I have the need for an edge BGP Gateway, to peer with our 3 ISPs. Each provider has a 10 Gbps capacity, and are received on a switch, on SFP+ ports, except one of them that is connected to a QSFP+ port. For the BGP peering, will only accept a default route from each of the providers, i.e., we&#x27;re not interested in Full-BGP support, the BGP peerings are there so that we can send a couple of IPv4 and IPv6 routes. For internal routing, we have an OSPF networtk with a routing table with about 7000 routes at the backbone.
 The thing is, our Mikrotik CCR1072 edge router is not scaling well, and we&#x27;re planning on getting much more bandwidth on a couple of months. The current throughput is around 15 Gbps, and we&#x27;re estimating that we will double it before july. 
 I&#x27;m thinking of getting a L3 Switch with 40G/100G uplink that could connect to the edge switch, and manage the 3 peerings on this new switch (as a BGP edge router), so it will also handle the traffic. What L3 switch would you guys you recommend? I&#x27;d like a switch that could handle, say, 80 Gbps of routing? Considering the 3 peerings, and the 7000 OSPF routes.
 We&#x27;re also evaluating buying a new router, but Cisco and Juniper routers are basically too expensive right now, and checking out FS.COM I saw a couple of switches that could probably do the job, like this bare metal switch https://www.fs.com/products/69226.html. 
 Do you have any recommendations at a $10k-$15k budget?

 Just tried out an internet connect with 2Gbe speeds, but realized all my switching was 1gb only.
 SFP is fine for backbone links, but lots of my devices support 2.5gbe, so considering that as an option. So far it looks stupidly expensive though, like $120 for a 5 port unmanaged switch. Wondering if I&#x27;m missing something.....

 I´m sorry for my bad English. I from Argentina and I&#x27;m learning the language
 I work in a hospital in the area of ​​networking and it is my first job in that position. 
 I recently learned about Networking and put together a simple installation. IPS, Routers and Switches. In a room, on the first floor, place the Router (Mikrotik) together with the Provider&#x27;s Modem and a main Giga SWITCH. 
 For each floor, there is a Switch inside a rack that is fed by a network cable to the Main Switch (First floor). Everything works correctly but I wanted to know if you can answer some questions so as not to make mistakes and learn from you: 
 ​
  
Is it always better if there are fewer Switches? 
 Is it better to use more wiring and do without Switches? 
 The more equipment in the middle, I understand that more failures could be generated in the network. this is so?

 I want to run a software which I don&#x27;t trust too much.
 For that purpose I&#x27;ve set-up an Ubuntu machine using VM Workstation Player, while my host machine is running Windows 10.
 What worries me is that the software requires internet connection.
 Now, on the VM side I&#x27;ve set it to connect to a virtual network that was automatically created called VMnet8 (NAT).
 I&#x27;ve tried looking up ways to isolate the network further, but it seems that it&#x27;s too complex.
 Are my network and host safe with the current configuration?
 Thank you for taking the time to help me here

                              <span>Specific to my situation… a job I’m looking at has some desired qualifications listed as AWS and Palo Alto experience. A couple years ago I had to take an AWS training course for my school and came out with an associate level cert. Same for Palo. I have the certs but brain dumped most of it as I never ended up working with AWS or Palo in the real world.
 I’m not sure if I should put those certs on my resume. On one hand I want to show my future employer I have exposure to those technologies and a competence to learn AWS/Palo. On the other hand, I’m concerned i’ll be falsely advertising my skills and when in the interview it will be obvious those are “paper certs” that might bring into question my other qualifications.

Summary
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) (hereafter referred to as the “authoring organizations”) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to warn network defenders about malicious use of legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) software. In October 2022, CISA identified a widespread cyber campaign involving the malicious use of legitimate RMM software. Specifically, cyber criminal actors sent phishing emails that led to the download of legitimate RMM software—ScreenConnect (now ConnectWise Control) and AnyDesk—which the actors used in a refund scam to steal money from victim bank accounts.

 For those that may not have seen it, since instead of a new post they “updated” the one from November…Looks like it’s even worse than they first let on- now not just LastPass, but a bunch of their other products. Oh, and encrypted backups from some of those services- *and an encryption key for some of said backups*
 And MFA for some clients for other offerings .
 If the original breach wasn’t enough to get you and your org off any GoTo products , then I would hope this is it

                              <span>How do you guys handle it? Started at a new company a couple weeks ago, so I don’t want to ruffle too many feathers.
 But some of the things I’m seeing are NOT up to industry standards, but whenever I mention it to my supervisor he takes it personally. I’m getting paid plenty and can just keep my mouth shut, but not seeing redundancy just drives me mad.

                              <span>I&#x27;m only in my first year of being a sysadmin but I want to take steps towards a job that doesn&#x27;t require me to wake up in the middle of the night. To me, sleep is worth more than any amount of money. I was thinking of some pathways.
  
Cyber Security: there seems to be a lot of job openings and remote too, but I hear they can have a lot of overtime. I don&#x27;t mind overtime that much though.
 
DevOps: I feel like most of these positions are the same just better paid with some scripting.
 
Network Enginner: nope. I think they have it worse than me tbh. but yet again idk
 
System Engineer: Seems like basically a sr. sysadmin that implements stuff. they have the same on call bs 
 
SWE: idk I hear mixed things about it. I wouldn&#x27;t really know where to start either. I was majoring in CS but I dropped out due to receiving my current position. my local schools hate ppl who work full time.
 
Cloud Engineer/Admin: same thing but cloud version. I guess I can get remote work with this at least.
 
 I was planning on going to WGU to finish my degree. Maybe I should just become a farmer. tbh my job isn&#x27;t that bad but I just can&#x27;t deal with the on-call (one week a month) and 24/7/365 support aspect.
 any suggestions or advice is much appreciated :)

                              <span>Today i was attemting to enroll a users computer into intune via the Company Portal. I kept getting an error that the user was already part of the organization, despite the company portal not registering them or appearing in Endpoint manager.
 Well here&#x27;s where the fucked part comes in...
 I broke the cardinal rule of make a backup before you make changes. 
 I deregistered the user from their AzureAD thinking they&#x27;d automatically re-join. But no I ended up locking them out.
 In my attempt to recover their files I realized that the BitLockercker key was never stored in Azure or their Microsoft &quot;My Account&quot; Page. 
 That&#x27;s when it settled in that I really fucked up.
 My only option was to nuke their computer and hope they had backed up everything to Google Drive or OneDrive. But low and behold they didn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s company policy for them to store all their files in google drive and not store any files locally. Still I feel that I really fucked up and I spent 6 hours trying to recover their files and ended up nuking their machine.
 But lesson learned. Don&#x27;t run dangerous commands on a users machine, and make sure all their files are saved in the cloud if I do have to run dangerous commands.
 I really hope I don&#x27;t get fired. But I am submitting an Incident report tomorrow morning to the CEO, Co-Founder, and VP (users boss). Let&#x27;s hope I don&#x27;t get fucked too bad. All I got to say is there goes my bonus and raise...
 I&#x27;m also going to use this as an opportunity to implement better policy and training material so that the users are aware of the risks of saving data locally. If they had lost their computer they would have been in the same situation.

                              <span>Hi All
 I have an issue with a user not being able to save documents in any network locations
 Issue occurs when creating a brand new black document and going to save it to the file server https://imgur.com/a/sM7Fq1G (Doesnt matter what folder they choose, same error occurs)
 Same thing occurs if opening a document on the file server and editing/saving
 I have done the following
  
Unmapped/Remapped Network Drives
 DisableRobustifiedUNC Via Registry
 Reinstalled Office
 Checked permissions on file server
 Checked Security Groups
  
Nothing I do is allowing them to save. Suprisingly if he logs into the RDS Server with the same AD Account, the issue is not there and they can save/edit excel files on the file server without issues
 I haven&#x27;t attempted to create a new AD account yet but that will be the last resort
 Does anyone have any ideas? Havent had any luck with reccomendations from forums n the like so here I am
 Thanks

 No but seriously fun times.
 A customer is still using an MS-DOS based property management and accounting software. It runs on a pair of Pentium IV computers running Windows XP. Since XP has native DOS emulation, it&#x27;s the latest version of Windows that will work. Both computers have a crossover cable connecting them with static IP addresses set, so offline and airgapped.
 The customer reached out to me because their HP LaserJet 1160 was having problems and they couldn&#x27;t get anyone to work on it. They wanted a printer to replace it with, but wanted one with an LPT port. Long story short, I couldn&#x27;t find any of those handy, but was able to get things working with a USB printer. Enter the Brother HL-L2300D. A USB-only printer that still has Windows XP drivers listed on Brother&#x27;s website.
 Plug that guy in, install the drivers, share it, and then run
  
net use lpt2: &quot;\hostname\BrotherP&quot; /persistent:yes
  
Then I went into the DOS program and pointed print jobs to LPT2 instead of LPT1. Had to change the print processor from RAW to TEXT to get it printing, but print it did!
 It&#x27;s not every day I get to work on something this old, and normally I just say &quot;nah&quot; to unsupported stuff like this. But it works... they have a hot/warm spare running, and don&#x27;t need support from the vendor. So why not? I got them running and made them happy, and collected my check. Good times.

 I&#x27;ve been at my current company as an infrastructure engineer for 3 years. I found they were using Word Docs, spreadsheets, text documents, etc. scattered throughout folders on the network. Finding anything was time-consuming, particularly for new employees. And searching within spreadsheets, text files, and Word documents wasn&#x27;t possible from Windows Explorer, so if the document file name didn&#x27;t have your term, you were out of luck.
 I brought my previous experience with documenting with OneNote and have tried to persuade others to use it, with limited success. OneNote has some great features, but also some drawbacks.
 Some pros are access control, concurrent editing, and being globally searchable.
 Some cons are notebooks tied to personal Microsoft accounts (…</span>

 80+ vulnerability tickets, about 6 incident tickets, a few minor enhancement tickets, about a dozen access requests and a few other misc things and change requests
 How the fuck do they expect one person to do all this bullshit?
 I&#x27;m seriously about to quit on the spot
 So fucking tired of this bullshit I wish I was internal to a company and not working at a fucking MSP. I hate my life right now.

                              <span>As thousands are getting laid off, just remember to use your PTO!!! A shit load of workaholics and garbage management has set the expectations for no days off, but forget all that and use your pto. For context: A PM who rarely took days off(and always made a point about it) just got the axe. I’m sure he may or may not get compensated for those PTOs but just goes to show how important it is to take those paid days off

                              <span>I inherited a mess of a security environment at my current position and finally managed to get my company to move to SentinelOne but I am having issues removing our previous security software, Avast even with self-defense off it is proving to be an annoyingly resilient piece of software. The agents/local installs do not report to the business console anymore after sending a uninstall command but we still find it popping up on many machines across the company. 
 For reference my specialty is security but I got thrown into sysadmin/desktop support role.
 ​
 Has anyone have experience removing software like this after upgrading to enterprise grade EDR and what did you do to completely remove it from your systems?

Shortly, they are getting a office access system and want me(software dev) to make sure if it is online and working properly. I know a little bit about Nmap but I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s the right one. Sorry if i did any grammer mistakes, English is not my native languge. Thanks :)

                              <span>Title pretty much, I&#x27;m looking for an alternative to this tool. We use this around the office but sometimes it just fails. Probably a permissions thing somehow, but occasionally somebody is unable to unlock a user so we have to ask someone else to try. And from what I&#x27;ve seen the dev has disappeared, so I&#x27;m trying to find a replacement. Any recommendations much appreciated, free options preferred.

I&#x27;m looking into upgrading my company&#x27;s documentation systems (or lack thereof) from spreadsheets and OneNote to a SaaS solution. I come from an MSP background where we used ITBoost, so was wondering if there are any other similar solutions that you fine folk would recommend. I hear great things about ITGlue, which I&#x27;ve got a demo lined up for currently.

 I especially love the last paragraph:
 &quot;Importantly, management should also take the opportunity to address excessive employee compensation. The median salary at Alphabet in 2021 amounted to nearly $300,000, and the average salary is much higher. Competition for talent in the technology industry has fallen significantly allowing Alphabet to materially reduce compensation per employee. In particular, Alphabet should limit stock-based compensation given the depressed share price.&quot;
 This is all about reminding employees who is in charge. All those worker gains in the last three years, yeah, we need to roll those back. Can&#x27;t have the plebs getting uppity.

                              <span>I set up Business Premium trial accounts for a tech learning center. I create user accounts that are meant to be used by students for single day classes and therefore MFA is a big hindrance. One of the first things I need to do after creating the trial is to disable MFA by going to Azure Active Directory &gt; Properties &gt; Manage Security Defaults. However, they appear to have completely restructured the menu recently and that option is either no longer there or has been moved to another obscure location. I&#x27;m really hoping someone here knows where this option has gone. Thank you in advance!!

 Is there any difference between Windows Server 2019 and Windows Server 2012 R2 related to the mapping drive/share folder? I have a shared folder on a server, and on a computer, this folder is mapped, on windows server 2012 everything works ok, and in 2019 when I try to copy a file from this folder I get an error.

Whilst I&#x27;m not a junior, this is the only multi site company I&#x27;ve had real experience with. For some reason, they decided to use Meraki, and whilst it works, it also feels like it&#x27;s for small businesses at best
 What do you guys use at your place, and how many sites do you have? I am aware of plenty of networking gear, both cloud and locally managed, but I&#x27;m interested to know the extent of what&#x27;s used out there

                              <span>I&#x27;m a bit stumped on this. I have a 6tb volume on a Powervault MD3600i filled with mixed data. Two Windows 2012r2 servers are connected to it forming a failover cluster for a file server role. This has been fine for years, but now the role fails to bring the volume online due to a &#x27;thread exit or application request&#x27;. I believe this is actually timing out:
 Having removed the disk from the cluster entirely, if I try to bring it online on one of the hosts directly, it takes a long time - 30 minutes+ while disk management is locked up. But you can see constant data being read on the iscsi interfaces before it randomly mounts. The data continues to be read but at this point you can browse the data etc. It&#x27;s like it&#x27;s scanning the entire content of the volume. 
 I can&#x27;t figure out why this has started happening - it&#x27;s the same on both hosts, plus another unrelated server I&#x27;ve mounted it on. I guess the issue is the volume, but once it&#x27;s mounted everything seems okay with the data, and other volumes on other servers from the same MS3600i are cracking on with life. 
 Any ideas appreciated - I am perplexed.

When he disconnects and then reconnects his Laptop to the docking station using USB-C, his monitors have no signal. His keyboard and mouse work just fine but the monitors dont. Do you know what could be the cause?

                              <span>Hello my fellow sysadmins
 ​
 I&#x27;m at a loss here and maybe you can help. 
 ​
 I have a Logitech MX Master connected via BT to my PC. OS is Win10 Pro Build 19044. I&#x27;m using a third party BT Stick that works for all other peripherals I connect perfectly fine and did so for the mouse too - just to clarify it shouldnt be the stick imo. 
 ​
 The issue is the following: 
 ​
 Sometimes (I cant reproduce) the cursor freezes and I cant use the mouse anymore. Mouse is fully charged. To get the cursor moving again I need to either open - if it isnt already - the Bluetooth settings of Windows or if it is already open close it. This seems to reset a driver or wake a suspended driver or device. All movement and clicks the physical mouse performed while it wasnt working in Windows will then be carried out as if queued for later execution. 
 ​
 I cant find an option to disable energy saving and this just started a few weeks ago. Unfortunately I do not recall if it started after an update.
 ​
 ​
 Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated

                              <span>How are you guys handling patching the winRE vulnerability that was found? 
 Especially if the machine&#x27;s recovery partition is too small.
 Are you just disabling winRE and deleting the partition?
 disabling bitlocker, shrinking the windows partition and growing the winRE partition?
 something else? 
 Just want to hear what others are doing with this situation

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 I have two questions.
 ​
 1- Do I have to roll over the Kerberos decryption key of the AZUREADSSO computer account on prem AD at every 30 days? if yes , how can we automate this process? Or Is there any out-of-box solution for this?
 ​
 2 - if I doing this process during working hours will it break authentication ?
 ​
 ​
 3 - I have ran the &quot;Check-11Bissues.ps1&quot; script from GitHub to do some prelim investigations. I am getting an warning related to the AZUREADSSOACC computer account.
 ​
 ​
 ​
 There are 1 objects that do not have msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes configured or is set to zero. When authenticating to this target, Kerberos will use the DefaultDomainSupportedEncTypes registry value on the authenticating DC to determinte supported etypes. If the registry value is not configured, the default value is 0x27, which means &#x27;use AES for session keys and RC4 for ticket encryption&#x27; - If this target server does not support AES, you must set msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes to 4 on this object so that only RC4 is used. (Please consider working with your vendor to upgrade or configure this server to support AES. Using RC4 is not recommended) - If this target server does not support RC4, or you have disabled RC4 on DCs, please set DefaultDomainSupportedEncTypes on DCs to 0x18 or msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes on this object to 0x18 to specify that AES must be used. The target server must support AES in this case. Here are the objects that do not have msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes configured CN&#x3D;AZUREADSSOACC,OU&#x3D;Server,DC&#x3D;contoso,DC&#x3D;local

 I created a powershell script to map drives then persist so stays connected at logon. Just wondering if I should be using this generator to avoid any issues? 
 Since our devices are only AzureAD joined but connect to on prem share want to make sure no issues going forward

                              <span>Hey everyone, 
 i just wanted to know what are the best practices for setting up a windows 10 image or .wim file and deploying that as efficient as possible for a small business of 25 users and little ressources. Im just asking because I&#x27;m curious if there are other better ways. I came from a company which had 3000 Users and we used Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager for creating images and deploying them to specific PCs over ethernet.
 Right now at my new company this is not an option as it would be completely overkill for a small business and cost way too much. What I did instead is set up a virtual machine with windows 10 on my local computer, configure some local policies, install some software and create an image which I then deploy by using usb-sticks and using sample scripts from microsoft for formatting and applying the image. But is this really the best method? What I have to do for every PC after applying the image is updating everything, doing a domain or adding missing drivers which drives me nuts sometimes because sometimes the PC has network problems because of missing drivers, which I then have to add manually. 
 What I liked about Endpoint Configuration Manager was that you could automate all of these things. Drivers could be added to the task sequence and where loaded from a specific server which the PC connected to while applying the task sequence. Domain join and updates etc. where also all done while applying task sequence. What was left to do for the admin was just to check if everything worked after the PC finished and most of the time, it worked. Is there any similar, cheaper technology or method which can reach the same level of automation?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 i&#x27;m looking for some help with a AD replication trouble.
 Short story: i got a new customer with an existing AD replication between 2 sites using an IPSec VPN.
 Friday, 2 of the 3 HDD on the secondary site failed. I had to lend a server replacement and restore the last save. Obviously the AD replication failed at restart and i can&#x27;t figure how to fix this.
 repadmin /replsummary is telling me that the source server is currently rejecting replication requests
 ​
 Well, i&#x27;m sending out an SOS :D
 ​
 Sorry for my syntax, i&#x27;m french :o

                              <span>Hey first time poster long time lurker and was hoping someone may have done this previously or have more experience with azure apps than myself.
 I’ve spoke with Apple Support and got a vague “no not possible” answer, however, I feel like it might be, just the management would be on the Azure end.
 Essentially I’m working to get Apple Business Manager linked to Azure AD so we can take control of personal Apple IDs and reset passwords, etc. when users inevitably lock themselves out. 
 I’ve done most of the leg work and am now at the point of hitting enable…Speaking to Apple support, I explained that our end goal is to run this as a phased roll out slowly adding users and taking over their Apple ID, the support team said it’s all or nothing and any existing Apple ID that conflict will essentially have 60 days to move information over to a different account before we take control. 
 Is this really the case? Could I limit who/what the enterprise app can see so we can add users a batch at a time?

                              <span>Hi all, we’re preparing to migrate our 365 tenant into the tenant already established by a company that has acquired our company. A third party is doing the actual migration and has carried out a pilot migration which has brought some issues to light, the biggest being that not everything has been migrated over. 
 Speaking to the third party we have established that they’re using ‘MigrationWiz’ to do the migration and in the help materials they specifically mention that some items are not migrated:
  
Calendar notifications
 Items that do not match folder types
 Bounce notifications
 etc
  
We are looking for a way to count the items in user mailboxes, excluding the ones that are not migrated so that we can verify what has moved over. I have found the PS cmdlets ‘Get-MailboxFolderStatistics’ and ‘Get-MailboxStatistics’ but neither really do what we need, has anyone done this before/got any suggestions on how we can verify what has migrated please?

 Are there ways to rebuild the foreign config of a disk after clearing it so it can be imported back in the old Virtual Drive?
 Server: Dell R720xd
 I have all the disks, 2 disks weren&#x27;t cleared so still have the foreign config, the rest is now recognized as unconfigured (good).

 Tried a different machine and the restore failed. AWS is looking into it, SAP is looking into it. Nobody knows why it won’t restore. Even the dev team is looking into it.
 Test your backups every once in a while.
 Thankfully this entire thing was just a DRP exercise. Our “main” backups seem to be working.

                              <span>Hello all,
 due to a new project we got a new password manager. Now we need to protect this data. 
 Now the data protection department came and said that it is very common in IT to separate &quot;account information&quot; (UserName and Password) and &quot;access information&quot; (IP address, DomainName) and store them in different systems.
 Plan would be the following 
 Account information -&gt; PasswordManager
 Access information -&gt; Tool X 
 The plan is then that the colleagues can look up the access information via Tool X for example &quot;Greensystem has IP XX.XXX.XXX&quot; and then search for the account information in the PasswordManager. Title: Greensystem, UserName &quot;Test&quot;, Password: &quot;123456&quot;
 I am a big friend of security but have never heard this procedure of information storage and find the whole thing for colleagues who access 5-15 times to any systems simply much too inefficient. I can imagine that colleagues will soon go crazy like this. 
 What is your experience with this? Do you have any comments here? Am I seeing this wrong or do I need to do some more convincing here?

                              <span>Hey guys
 I am wondering how you solve this case in your organisation.
 We have a hybrid AD solution. So we have on-prem AD which is synced with O365. So we administrate the AD on-prem and it syncs it to O365.
 If a user is inactive we change OU and disable them. In O365 the user will stay active but the login will be blocked. If the user has a email forwarding address this will be active too.
 This behaviour is because if a user will be accidently moved (we have a script from our ERP) to disabled OU that not all will be deleted.
 In O365 there is no section like &quot;disabled users&quot; only &quot;deleted users&quot;, or do I miss something?
 The unhappy thing is that the email forwarding will still be active.
 How you handle this all? Do you block email forwarding at all?
 If we would remove the email forwarding on every move to disable OU there would be a case if the user was accidently moved to that OU.
 Best regards

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 ​
 Quick story: i&#x27;m currently working as a junior sysadmin at a small company with 70 employees for over 1 year. (this is my first IT job, i&#x27;m currently 22 years old)
 Me and my IT Manager manage all the servers, the whole network and offer support to our collegues. 
 The last few months do have been really boring for me as there has not been a lot of work. All the server run smooth and in a 40 hour work week I have like 10 hours of work so i&#x27;m really bored. I already tried studying but a person can only study a certain amount of hours per day... 
 Recently though I have had a really good offer on Linked with a big company in my local area. They got a Sysadmin team with more than 20 people. 
 For me this is a very good opportunity as they are prepared to learn me everything from scratch. So I won&#x27;t be bored as there is a a lot of work. I will even get the oppurtunity to travel abroad with our sysadmin team to maintain the server park abroad. They even offer the ability to earn certificates. 
 Not only that, my pay and benefits will also increase significantly. 
 My problem is now that I feel guilty about turning in my resignation as my manager will be left alone to manage the whole IT infrastructure in my current company. 
 ​
 What is the best approach to this situation and how can I turn in my resignation professionally? 
 ​
 Many thanks &amp; kind regards!

                              <span>Looking for recs on Managed, industrial grade din Rail mountable switches. Only requirement is that it supports vlans and 24vdc for power input. If it can do both 24vdc and 120volt that would be a plus. But for the most part we power with 24vdc.
 We have a manufacturing facility that deals a lot with sand castings so there is a ton of really fine silica sand that gets everywhere. These din Rail Switches usually go inside a machine box that doesn&#x27;t have the greatest filtration and will be exposed to quite a bit of dust/fine sand not to mention in summer months some pretty hot temperatures as we are are dealing with molten metal, furnaces, etc etc in a factory environment. 
 If anyone has experience with what I&#x27;m looking for please let me know what your go to is.

                              <span>Sorry novice question here. I&#x27;ve heard this time and again, and still haven&#x27;t found a good explanation, &quot;In CLOS-style, leaf-spine topology, you wouldn&#x27;t need expensive/high-end modular/chassis based switch to work as a spine, you could just put one of the plug-in/fixed-form-factor inexpensive switches to act as spine as they wont need to have all the routes installed in their hardware/TCAM table&quot;. While I understand the logic behind the spines not having to need to install all the routes in their hardware (for example, with EVPN, they would just need to save the next-hop leaf destination ), what does &#x27;chassis-based vs fixed-form-factor&#x27; argument mean?

 It&#x27;s marked as the primary name server but it doesnt have port 53 open:
 $ nc -zv opensmtpd.org 53 nc: connect to opensmtpd.org port 53 (tcp) failed: Connection refused 
 Is that a mistake? That cannot be valid, it&#x27;s not even listed as one of the nameservers:

                              <span>I&#x27;m reading into some BT supplier notes and have come across their managed broadband. The whole connection is their responsibility up until the communications provider (CP). 
 PPP sessions are forwarded to the CP. At this point they say, it is the responsibility of &quot;the CP to terminate these PPP sessions and assign an IP address to the session&quot;. 
 I&#x27;m not familiar with this process and would like to know:
  
Is this a complex thing to do? 
 Or is it abstracted away?
 
 Where can I find more info about this process?
  
Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you!

 No default IP address for VLAN1 on these switches. Must connect via console first and assign one.
  
I have been given some old AT-8000s switches to play with; all factory reset to defaults.
 The unhelpful manual simply says &quot;Enter the device IP address in the address bar and press &quot; without ever specifying what the default device IP address is.
 Does anyone know?

 How does Firepower and Fortigate compete in reliability? We run Firepower at the moment and from my experience.. it&#x27;s kinda up and down. We have a huge environment (10k+ peak daily endpoints) where everything is basicly Cisco. In theory, would a Fortigate be a pain in the ass to setup? What are your guys experiences with FortiGate vs. Firepower?

 My company is making a large push this year to have polished documentation on every aspect of IT. Searching around I&#x27;m not finding much for Network and Infrastructure but I did find this company and their PDF reports look fantastic and would please the C-suite very much. 
 Just wondering if anyone has used it or dealt with this company before?

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m relatively new to this and was wondering on the correct procedure for installing a new internet circuit in one of my company&#x27;s offices. The vendor is Verizon and they&#x27;ve come in and installed their circuit demarc gear (ciena 3903) and dropped me off a Cisco Meraki router that the tech did not install and said it was up to us to install it. Verizon also provided me with a /30 WAN CIDR with one IP being Verizon&#x27;s IP and one being my IP.
 My question is: do I really need to install their router for this installation? can i not just wire myself straight from the NID device to my palo alto firewall and just give the interface the IP information they supplied me, using the Verizon IP as the gateway? or am i missing something crucial here that I need their router for? 
 Thanks for any insight

                              <span>I’m starting a position that has a good budget for conferences as long as I can show how it will benefit the company. This is new to me because I’ve never worked somewhere that was willing to spend the money. What are the conferences you recommend?
 I’m looking for mainly datacenter, automation, and vendor-agnostic stuff. I’m really looking to keep up with the direction of the industry. I’m not too worried about the other aspects of the conference (food, location, or accommodations). 
 Also, in your opinion, which conferences aren’t worth the time/money. 
 Any thoughts on Cisco Live?

                              <span>I am testing using WPA2 Enterprise with PEAP/MSChapv2 (User-based auth) and Clearpass for our NAC but have some questions.
 ​
 My GPO to push the 802.11 profile is set to auto-connect after-login and perform SSO with domain-creds. My concern is that because these PCs won&#x27;t be connected before-login GPO won&#x27;t process properly during login.
 Am I correct in this or will it connect immediately after login and then perform policy updates after? Should I explore machine-based auth and have it connect before login? 
 ​
 I was hoping to use machine-based auth for initial connectivity for domain-level services (SMB, RPC, Kerberos, LDAP, etc) and then user-based auth after login for full access - Just not having any luck on identifying if it is even possible. (Similar to machine-based auth for a VPN which gets you connected to the domain and then user-level auth to obtain access to all other resources)
 ​
 Thanks, everyone.

                              <span>We are currently dealing with communication issues with 18 out of 60 inverters on site.
 To give you a brief overview of the site comms schematics, we have 2 x inverters per station, connecting to their own local distributed comms box. There are also CCTV cameras, DC combiner boxes and weather station equipment connected at the same ethernet switches within the distributed comms boxes. There are 4 separate VLANs on site with subnets 72, 73, 74 and 75. These correlate to four separate inverter radials on site. The one we are having issues with is VLAN 1/Subnet 72, which has inverters 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.2, 6.1, 6.2, 7.1, 7.2, 8.1, 8.2, 9.1, 9.2.
 On December 16th, we had our first issue, where inverters 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, 3.1, 3.2, 5.1, 5.2, 6.1, 6.2, 7.1, 7.2, 8.1, 8.2, 9…</span>

                              <span>I have a VLAN dedicated for equipment supplied by outside vendors that need internet access. All endpoints on this VLAN will be a device that will connect a VPN back to it&#x27;s individual vendors home office to give them remote management access. 
 Most of these devices come with a fairly well documented list of access requirements for the VPN to function. Meaning that the vendor has provided all the information needed to lock down the connection. This is great! But, to me, it is kind of silly to go to all the trouble of locking down 90% of these appliances if the other 10% are not well secured, get compromised, and end up allowing open access to everything else on that layer2 subnet. 
 I already have the vlan/subnet locked down so that it has zero access to the internal network. But I would like to take it a step further by locking down layer2 communication in that vlan/subnet so that each endpoint can only communicate with the gateway (fortinet 80f) and outside internet. 
 Rough breakdown of my hardware in place it as follows:
 Internet &gt; Fortigate 80f &gt; mdf-access - Cisco 3850 &gt; core-switch - Cisco Nexus 3548P &gt; idf-access - Cisco 3850 &gt; Vendor Endpoints
 Internal network gateways live on the nexus 3548p which also handles the internal routing.
 Guest and isolated vlan/subnet gateways live on the fortigate. No routing other than sending traffic to the internet. On the switches, there is just the layer2 vlan configured, no layer3 svi. 
 So, is configuring private vlans my best bet here? https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/article/a-quick-summarized-view-to-private-vlan-pvlan-x
 Or is there a better way to isolate layer2 endpoints? Am I overthinking this?
 Also, let me know if I left out any information that would be useful for a recommendation.

 Thank you for any thoughts or advice!

 I need solution which can extend office multicast to home (for work from home etc) over internet. 
 1.We cannot use M-BGP 
 2.GRE tunnel will need public static IP for home and a cisco device.

 Are there data center environments where it&#x27;s just NOT a reasonable choice?
 Obviously there&#x27;s a complexity argument at the small end: &quot;It&#x27;s only a dozen switches! I&#x27;ll just use STP, rather than adopt all of that complexity...&quot;
 Are there business or application requirements which are just not well served by EVPN? What are they?

                              <span>Question for anyone who used NSO with CARE to automate STIGs.
 So we had call yesterday with a few guys from Cisco to discuss us potentially ordering Cisco NSO. The main reason for purchasing is to use their CARE product which will allow us to automate STIG checking and filling out the STIG checklists for us, among other things.
 During this meeting the guy referenced anislble alot and said that NSO using a lot of ansible playbooks to do these checks. Even when he showed us the output of some of the checks, i noticed that it is the same output that I would get from ansible. Everything from what it prints down to even the color it prints in.
 So my question. Everything that NSO CARE does for checking STIGS (compliance checks, differences between golden configs and all other configs, filling out STIG checklists, etc.), could it all be done with ansible playbooks? I have some experience with ansible and python, and I have my own playbooks/scripts that do compliance checks, check differences between configs, tell me what STIG findings are open, etc. The only thing I really havn&#x27;t figured out how to do yet that I really would like to be able to do is automate filling out the checklists. Not sure if thats possible with an ansible playbook or not.
 TLDR: Is Cisco NSO with CARE worth the cost, or can I just do everything with Ansible?

                              <span>Hi,
 I am working on a project right now and there is a change in ip address space of the ISP, they are moving from x.x.x.0/24 (old address space) address to y.y.y.0/24 (new address space). Both ranges are currently rout&#x27;able through the existing gateways but after the end of this week only y.y.y.0/24 will be available for us to use.
 The current problem we are facing is that we already setup everything in y.y.y.0/24 address space in advance (interface, gateway, nat, security policy etc), but there seems to be some issue with NAT overload (trusted to untrusted) rules and we are seeing the issues mostly with SIP and RTP traffic. The issue is that even if we have configured ip y.y.y.y on the untrusted/outside interface and have a NAT rule for outbound traffic (to use interface), the firewall is taking the old ip configured on the outside interface (x.x.x.x). Not sure why it&#x27;s behaving like this for SIP and RTP but most of the other traffic is using the new IP (y.y.y.y). 
 We verified if the traffic is hitting the correct policy using test and it&#x27;s hitting the correct NAT rule and shows the correct translated address. But checking the active sessions using the show session commands shows it&#x27;s not using the current interface ip but the old ip of the interface. We verified the output of the show session against the corresonding NAT rule and we can see the SIP/RTP sessions under that rule but using old ip as a translated source address.
 The firewall is on 8.1 version and upgrading is not an option right now as we are in a process of migrating the firewalls. Tried clearing the sessions, removing and re-adding the NAT rule, but this buggy behaviour exist. Should I disable SIP ALG/inspection and allow traffic through security policy?
 Apologies for the long post and any help is really appreciated.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m working with Cisco and Arista VXLAN Fabrics. We usually build them for small and midsize enterprises. Sometimes bigger ones. For me, most DCs have around 50 switches. 
 But, after everything is finished and we take a look in the EVPN table, we find that they can get pretty big. Sadly most customers want &quot;every vlan everywhere!!!11&quot; which certainly won&#x27;t help with scalability. As we have to add a VLAN to 50 switches, even if it&#x27;s only used on 2 switches. 
 After we did dig a bit in scalability and how to minimize table entries (depending on BGP design obviously). We are not sure how big someone could scale a standard VXLAN EVPN Fabric. Someone told me &quot;around 400 switchs, then it gets janky&quot; another one said &quot;we have 2000 switches in a campus VXLAN EVPN fabric, everything is fine&quot;. So, how far can we/you go? What are the limits?
 I&#x27;m not talking about the routing table of the switches, of course some switches will fill their tables earlier than others. But if you use switches with millions of possible entieries, where is the limit?
 I know already that the public clouds don&#x27;t use a DC network like the ones we build. They have &quot;software&quot; on their servers for their fabric and don&#x27;t have all that state in their network. It wouldn&#x27;t scale that big.

                              <span>Hi there I was wondering if some one could recommend a budget freindly cable tester with the ability to test max cable speed. The cheaper ones I found onaly supports 10Mbps, 100Mbps, 1Gbps. But I would like to test 10Mbps, 100Mbps, 1Gbps, 2.5Gbps, 5Gbps and 10Gbps I am happy to buy second hand

 That is all well and good until I got a call from the real &quot;Microsoft Support&quot; trying to close out an old support call. Me being me, I did not let them get that far, I just continued to swear at them and eventually hung up.
 Oops.
 It should be interesting at the next monthly meeting with my TAM and Microsoft Account Exec team.

                              <span>After 5 years at a small full service MSP, where I started with absolutely 0% experience in IT, and have slowly moved to a supervisor position and had been in talks with the owner for me to take over the company when he retires, I just got an offer with a 20% increase in pay and full benefits. I still have one class left before I get my bachelors and no security clearance so I didn’t think I would qualify for many jobs in my area but it turns out my interviewing went better than I expected and I’m just so damn excited to take the next step in my career.
 Any advice for working in the government sector?

                              <span>Remember, that if you die on Monday, your job will be listed on Wednesday. Don’t give your company any more loyalty than they give you. 
 My employees are great and I do every I can for them. And I know that my boss has my back, and even his boss. But I work for a megacorp… go far enough up and my name means nothing. I’m an employee ID number and an expense on some MBAs spreadsheet. 
 I’m not advocating that anyone do subpar work, but I’m also saying if you get a significantly better offer strongly consider it, because if the bean counters could clone you, and ship your clone to a lower cost of employment country and maintain the same level of productivity, there would be 3 of you doing your job from a foreign country right now.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve heard stories online of new IT Admins finding a &quot;dead man&#x27;s switch&quot; on their network after the previous Admin left, but I&#x27;ve yet to hear it from my actual IT acquaintances; it&#x27;s always &quot;I know a guy, whose previous boss had cousin that worked at a company...&quot;. What I mean by &quot;dead man&#x27;s switch&quot; is a buried Powershell or Python script set to do something if the IT guy is suddenly fired or their account is disabled. Is this just a tall tale or a unicorn?

                              <span>Hi sysadmin,
 I manage a crew of seasonal temps—25 people or so, (summer months) doing customer service work in the natural resource field at remote rural sites. Age range is class of $current_year to old boomers. 
 Part of their job is data collection--we use cheap android tablets for this. results are cached and uploaded when they get to a network.
 For many years we&#x27;ve just let them use their personal phone for work related stuff. I&#x27;ll text them if there is a call out and I need to reassign their task, or if there is a tornado for instance. It&#x27;s been fine for everyone except the past couple of years HR has been making noises expressing their worry about the BYOD. We had a retirement in my chain and now I&#x27;ve got the big seat. (Change happens when change happens) anywho, New year—new policy! For my part the personal phone thing freaks me out--the main ones are workplace stalking/creeping and also protecting my staff from having their personal property taken as evidence.
 ​
 What should we do?
 ideas so far--
 furnish each with a company iPhone and company iPad. phone is for contact, iPad is for data entry.
 Furnish each with an iPhone and use it for contact and collection. Con of this is old people and fat fingers/data entry/battery life.
 furnish each with an iPad (cellular) and use it for contact and data entry. Con is they don&#x27;t have a work number. 
 I briefed my leadership and IT staff on this and they were both supportive of whatever proposal i make. My boss is an apple fanboy. We&#x27;ve got dollars in the budget to roll this out. 
 other useful things:
 org has 500 people on payroll and we all use office 365 in a Windows environment. 
 I&#x27;ll have a breakfast burrito.

                              <span>Just wanted to share what I did to disable these random ads in the Windows 11 Pro Start Menu (I found that these apps are not actually installed, they&#x27;re just place holders... Essentially ads). Check out the following group policy to get rid of these random tiles for TikTok, CandyCrush, Prime Video, WhatsApp, etc...
 Computer Configuration &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Cloud Content &gt; Turn off cloud optimized content + Turn off Microsoft consumer experience.
 Once these are enabled and applied, users who have not yet logged in will not see these upon logging in. For users that have already logged in, the policy seems to have no effect unless you delete the local profile, and have them log back in.

                              <span>I received an unsolicited email from N-Able today that started off like this:
  
I understand that you or a colleague at  is doing some research on server backup technology! I would love to learn more about your role.
  
I&#x27;ve mentioned before that my email address is not published anywhere and I&#x27;ve never shared it with any platform with permission to send me marketing crap, much less share it with others for marketing.
 You can imagine my annoyance when I receive unsolicited email from people trying to sell me things.
 The part that bugs me is reading between the lines. They know *someone* at  is doing &quot;research&quot; but not who. That tells me they&#x27;re using ZoomInfo (from which I&#x27;m opted out but I trust gas station egg salad more than them) or a similar platform to scavenge information from people who brush past their website. 
 And not knowing who, they decided to shotgun every address they have available for the company. 
 The truly shit part is that I replied to the message with the very concern I mentioned here and got a 550 error bounceback that tells me they block direct emails (there was a link to a calendar platform to schedule an appointment in the message, screw that). 
 Of course this is the level of bullshit I expect from SolarWinds.

                              <span>My question for the community is what&#x27;s the advantage to buying the overpriced drives and RAM from Dell when I can get equivalent hardware for much cheaper. I&#x27;d rather buy a couple of extra sticks of RAM and an extra NVMe as cold spares and save thousands, but am I missing some advantage or gotcha? The SKUs I&#x27;m looking at are:
 400-BKGI
 370-AEVP
 ​
 Thoughts/suggestions?
 EDIT: Yes this is for a production system for our organization but we do want to not spend needlessly; specifically 2 Linux KVM virtualization platforms which will be clustered. I&#x27;ve done something similar in the past about 10 years ago and it all worked just fine. It seems Dell has to cover the SKUs we are purchasing from them so it could be a good way to save money. Thanks for all of the replies so far.
 EDIT2: For contractual reasons, we need to buy Dell servers. Bleghhh. 
 EDIT3: Super helpful responses, everyone. Thanks! We are mulling our options.

                              <span>Hey everyone, sorry in advance if this is not the right sub to post in but I figured there has to be multiple people in my scenario. I’ve been trying to deal with my lead, whom i’m glad to help out if they actually require help, who will call for a quick question about something but will then address other multiple ongoing issues that my team including myself is assigned to. 
 At first I was like “ugh that’s my lead, i have to pick up every call….” but lately I’ve been ignoring more and more. When I do pick up their call (sensing the importance), the same cycle begins. 
 How do I professionally say “don’t bring up other topics, stick to one”?

                              <span>This is an update from a post I made 4 months ago: Rant: VIP wants No security - is this the hill I die on?
 You all assured me I wasn&#x27;t crazy and a lot of you gave really good advice. I was inspired by this post yesterday to come back and give an update. (I feel for that OP, because I could have written most of that myself)
 So after sharing my rant 4 months ago, I started to take take a look at my resume. I used a career coach who gave great tips on formatting my resume and I started to look for jobs. I had offers upwards of 70k more than I was making, with some even higher if I was looking to relocate (I wasn&#x27;t). After about a month, a LOT of interviews, and a few offers, I accepted a position that pays considerably more with more wfh, better commute, and better perks.

 My thought has been a Jabra Speak usb/Bluetooth speaker/mic, but the camera side I am struggling with, since usually there is one mounted to a computer or something on one side of the room. So Im a bit of a loss here.
 Anyone have some suggestions?

For a long time we&#x27;ve using a bat file with powercfg commands but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be setting the &quot;Choose what closing the lid does&quot; setting. I&#x27;ve followed the steps here (option 3 and 4), How to Change Default Lid Close Action in Windows 10 | Tutorials (tenforums.com) but it doesn&#x27;t have an effect on that setting. Any suggestions? Maybe a better way to do this? I know SCCM can apply power plans via device collections but I am wondering if users would be locked out from making changes?

                              <span>Hi All,
 Our current backup solution is done by Windows Server Backup configured on the VMs running on Hyper-V. Now we would like to change this method to configure Windows Server Backup on the Hyper-V host, so that the backup includes the Hyper-V items (including the VMs).
 When I am selecting the items what should be backed up, the VMs under the Hyper-V menu are shown to be offline. 
 This is very strange because the VMs are happily running and they perform all their tasks precisely. 
 All integration services are enabled on the VMs.
 What could be the problem here?
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>We have planning on deploying Bitlocker To Go organisation wide, to prevent data leakage. I have some issues I need to tackle, and I wonder do any of you have any experience in the matter and/or suggestions how to move on with these.
 #1: In our org there are situations where data is given to clients via usb. Client might have whatever OS running, so no guarantees the encrypted USB will work. How have you handled this?
 #2: Preventing data leaking is one thing, but I also want to prevent malicous USB attacks. I can set autorun bans, auto AV scans, but have you tried a forced formatting rule etc..? I know McAfee had such a feature, that it forced you to format the usb wether you wanted to use it.

 We are experiencing difficulty sending emails using certain email clients (such as Mail in MS Windows or Thunderbird) due to our email provider blocking certain regions. Our credentials and port settings are correct, but we are unable to send emails. We discovered that our region is currently blocked, but we were able to resolve the issue by submitting a ticket and getting our specific IP added to the provider&#x27;s whitelist for our region. Is it possible to set up a relay or other solution to allow users outside the office to send emails?

                              <span>Hi guys, I am still relatively new to the Azure Cloud and everytime I thinkt that I have an understanding, I learn that I don&#x27;t understand anything at all. 
 For a small deployment I need to make a VM public. I know that I can simply use a public IP and it is done, but then I have a self administrated host exposed to the internet and that might not be the best idea. 
 Of course I could always use an Azure Firewall, but this is quite expensive and destroys the budget. Is there any way to have a small Internet Gateway which does the same as an Azure Firewall, but for small deployments?
 What about a load balancer, can I give it a public IP and use this one to NAT to my server?? Or is this a big security risk as well? 
 How do you do this in Azure?

                              <span>We are a small start-up company and I got a task to improve things in our company.
 We currently give laptops out to emplyees without doing anything. When a laptop arrives, we start it once, so we go past the initial start-up, activate BitLocker, setup a simple PIN and give it to the emplyee. 
 The problems:
 Its very very hard to force the employees to use tools like KeePass for PW management or even our own WIKI. Also, I am worried about security. I am thinking about settings up an admin account and a user account, which cannot install anything. 
 How are these things usually handled in bigger companies?
 I would also like to hear how you force your employees to use the tools? How do you handle passwords?

                              <span>Hey folks,
 I have no idea, what I could do to solve my problem.
 In the company, I currently work for, there are several iPad users who want to access their personal folder (stored on windows file server), which is shared through a restricted access. 
 The end user has no permissions to see the content of the folder above, but the &quot;own&quot; one.
 Maybe it&#x27;s a bit easier to understand, if I show you an example:
 \\SERVER\USERHOMES$\JOHNDOE
 None of the users can see, what&#x27;s inside of USERHOMES$, but they can access their folder JOHNDOE with special permissions. 
 I&#x27;ve seen multiple threads that reported, that this kind of file sharing isn&#x27;t possible through the native &quot;Files&quot;-app on iPad OS 16 or earlier.
 Do you guys have any idea?
 A third-party app would work, but we prefer to use native apps.
 ​
 Thanks in advance,
 Pacman

                              <span>We are trying to update our HP PC&#x27;s firmware using WSUS but are running into an issue. We have approved the firmware in WSUS and can see it in a state whereby it&#x27;s ready to go. When checking for updates on the client side however nothing pulls through, however doing a &#x27;check online for updates&#x27;, the PC will happily draw the firmware down from the internet and install. Any thoughts on what else we can check server side for WSUS? The firmware versions on WSUS are identical to the ones the PC draws from the internet so it&#x27;s a strange one.

                              <span>Hi All,
 We are a somewhat small organization and are planning to buy a physical servers and use them as have VMWare vSphere 8 running on that with different VMs of Windows Server 2022 Standard.
 Regarding the HW Specs and application stack hosting
  
We are purchasing: CPU - 128 Cores
 We require: CPU - 78 Cores
  
The architecture requirement will be 3 production servers &amp; 1 staging server
 Server 1 - 16 cores
 Server 2 - 8 cores 
 Server 3 - 32 cores
 (Staging) Server 4 - 32 cores
 Will we be able to spin up the VMs without having the proper coverage of licenses, I was informed by the deployment team that it only requires activating the server licenses with a single 2 Core license pack on each server VM and that we can still run the VMs without having the additional Server Core licenses purchased additionally. Would that be the case? As we are only buying 2 core license pack for a total of 16 cores of Windows Server 2022 Standard.
 *Disclaimer, I am not managing the server, I am advising on hardware purchasing/approval/compliance for the respective deployment team. This is my first instance of approving and not too sure on the Server Core licensing requirements. Of course compliance will be looked into, just wanted to know practically if what was mentioned above by deployment team is correct.
 Thanks

I ran the command slmgr.vbs /dli in CMD and according to the output(volume licensing, 180 days remaining bla bla) it means the OS has been cracked according to what google said
 did we get scammed?

                              <span>Hey everyone! 
 Newly appointed IT Manager here. I&#x27;m a one man band coming to the end of several projects I managed over the last 6 months, including Intune MDM configuration / deployment, Cyber Essentials + accreditation, and an 80 page IT policy written from scratch... 
 I am now planning for the next 6 months. Does anyone have any advice on what you&#x27;d be doing off the back of the projects above? Any recommendations in terms of what I should be focusing on for the company? I&#x27;m considering getting a 3rd party in for some pen testing (customers often request evidence of this), researching and planning for ISO27001 (not sure if we&#x27;re quite ready for this) and also looking at a device renewal scheme. 
 Literally any suggestions at all welcome - infrastructure improvements, security improvements, more accreditations for the company, employee education and training, more attack simulations? 
 Thanks in advance!

 Does anyone have any recommendations on an easy way to go about this with ass little interruption for the users as possible.
 I&#x27;ve played around with using windows update for this, it goes well since it does a lot in the background. But starting the update isn&#x27;t always easy because it only shows up if there are absolutely no other updates available.
 Using an iso to upgrade is easy to start, but it takes a long time because the user can&#x27;t keep working.

 I currently only get 1 remote day per week, the other 4 days I have to be onsite, which kinda sucks.
 Wonder how many remote days per week my fellow sysadmins get.

                              <span>Hi All, 
 first time posting here, but don&#x27;t know where else to go.
 Did an migration from redirected folders to Onedrive, i did the following steps:
  
Set the policy to redirect the folder back to local user profile
 after a week, disabled this policy so that users got the files back in their own profile.
 enabled onedrive sync to upload the files to onedrive.
  
so far so good, all files migrated, fileserver can be disabled, however, there are still users accessing the fileserver, but no files, only the root directory&#x27;s. 
 but the redirection policy is disabled, and if I turn of the fileserver users report their RDS sessions slow down.
 ​
 if you look in computer management you can see users accessing the root folders of their redirected folders, but nothing else, very strange behavior.
 ​
 Fileserver is on server 2012 r2, all other servers are on 2022.

                              <span>I’m not a big fan of repetitive, mindless tasks (who is?) and somehow I keep getting pulled into them. configuration prep, that’s pretty low tier into terms of priorities is being pushed onto me. Never mind all of the other more important fires I have to contend with.
 To make it even more ‘awesome’, the standard operating procedure that should have been developed by the team - who normally supports the appliances - wasn’t really put together until it felt like I asked. then they push me closer to the front to pioneer something that I don’t normally support, while waiting on others to be done with rack space so I can batch things.
 So, I pretty much said f it. At some point, you either care enough to not lose your job, or you learn as much as you can at the cost of losing your job. So I saw this as a glorious moment to try and automate it, even did it on my own dime. I figured it was worth the risk and it sounded fun. Well, I kept running into stupid little problems and my stuff got delayed. oops. But I learned sooo freakin much. The write up was worth it. I’m sitting here on significant amount of code that I’m pretty happy about, even with the remaining debugging. If I had got fired I would have shrugged, maybe felt a little worried but with unemployment.. I might be pretty happy about the prospect of real learning I could embark.
 I get some people really emphasize on the job learning, and I get it, but at some point you just hit a wall and you really have to fight for it or move to a management spot.
 Managers want you to be efficient, even at the cost of you learning marketable skills. Don’t buy into their landscape they try to carve for you- unless you share the same vision.

                              <span>Hello all, I&#x27;ve been crying for the last 30 minutes and feel like I&#x27;m going to throw up 🙃
 Basically our sysadmin is on vacation, and I am the only person beneath him. Anyway, one of our domain controllers in a remote location was rebooted over the weekend. I can&#x27;t ping it and I can&#x27;t RDP to it. 
 I know it&#x27;s online because I asked one of the guys in the office to take a picture of the monitor the DC is connected to through the comms room window lol. And the rest of their office is able to connect to wifi.
 In the past during a similar situation, I was able to fix this by getting someone to restart the Network Location Awareness service (just a random fix I found on Google).
 Sorry for the noob post, I know I deserve to be downvoted to oblivion but I&#x27;m panicking as I need to do some work on this server today.
 Thanks

 If i understood properly, first you create a RAID group, for example you make RAID 5 group and now you have 10TB stoage, so now you can create 10 LUNs, each is 1TB, and we make these LUNs so that Hosts can see it as logical disks that they can use?
 If this is true, than what are volumes for?

                              <span>I am about to work for an MSP. I did some research and a few things came up a lot. 
 Pros: you learn a LOT! Cons: it&#x27;s intense, demanding, fast paced, poorly managed, average pay
 I have mixed feelings, and reading the reviews about the company doesn&#x27;t help either! Lots of complaints, quite intimidating overall.
 I really want the experience for sure!! At the same time it sounds like an unhealthy environment and I don&#x27;t want to burn out or go insane. Should I give it a shot?
 And most importantly what are job interview Dos and don&#x27;ts?

                              <span>ChatGPT is an AMAZING study tool but maybe it&#x27;s affecting my google skills. 
 The response I&#x27;m getting for &quot;what if you don&#x27;t know the number of hops away when configuring&quot; (as part of a larger ChatGPT &quot;conversation&quot;) is: 
 &quot;You can still configure BGP without knowing the exact number of hops. It&#x27;s possible to use a &#x27;default&#x27; number of hops in the configuration or use a wildcard to match any number of hops. You can also make use of path explored by using the BGP traceroute command.&quot; 
 I know that you can change the ttl value as needed but when you don&#x27;t know the exact number, do you just estimate (and/or purposely overshoot it?). 
 I like the idea of using traceroute to count the number of hops but on the internet I think some points can be blocked from being counted in traceroute (or may just the ip is blocked but you can count the &quot;*&quot; instead). I also assume that if there is any AS prepending along the way this number could be off. 
 Specifically, do you, in practice, just type something like... 
  neighbor 192.52.100.2 remote-as 65555 neighbor 192.52.100.2 ebgp-multihop 255 
 and just hope that the neighbor&#x27;s hop count away is within the max ttl value?

                              <span>I recently had a customer reach out in frustration after one of their sites reported Microsoft services believed they were location in a different market/timezone. They operate co-working sites so there are MANY transient devices coming and going each day. 
 After having the ISP review the IP Location data submitted to ARIN and a bit of troubleshooting we determined it was ONLY Microsoft and I was able to locate the location service opt-out form: https://account.microsoft.com/privacy/location-services-opt-out
 Bing maps goes so far as to precisely locate web browser clients to the LAT/LONG of the same companies location in the incorrect market. Google and other services operate correctly.
 Has anyone else had success having MAC addresses of AP&#x27;s and layer 3 devices removed from the MS Location database? Any additional roadblocks?

 Before I write erase the switch I would like to backup the license file as I assume it will be erased as part of the process. But, for some reason I cannot get a FAT32 USB key to mount in the usb port. 
 I am running 6.2.9a. 
  
a cursory search shows this to be a bug in this software version, but I do not have access to download a newer version.
 is there any other workaround for this bug? 
 does a write erase actually blow away the license? It is a standard 12 port 16G license. 
  
Thanks for the help.

 I began working IT at a small organization (~20 people) a couple years ago and was able to learn basic sysadmin stuff with help from reddit. (Handled migrating SBS 2011 to Server 2019, a task which seemed out of my depth at first) But one area of IT knowledge I&#x27;m still somewhat lacking in is networking. 
 I&#x27;ll start with what I do understand: DNS, DHCP, and VPN for remote access are all handled by our Windows Server. I&#x27;m also pretty sure I understand that the hardware is connected like so: Modem -&gt; Router -&gt; Switch -&gt; Server/PCs. 
 Anyway, our router, a Netgear SRX5308, is EoL and long overdue for a replacement, so I believe I si…</span>

I’m curious what the current pulse is like though, and where I should be pivoting my efforts to learn? Is a network automation job worth the hop(personal experience)? Is network automation worth skipping into? Personal experience would be nice to hear.
 I now have a collection of no starch books I keep buying and am here and there working through them - for at least high level knowledge. I’d like to better prioritize what languages in general that are going to be the next thing when it comes to automation. I can see AI being a critical component to integrate more and more with network automation, but I’d think this landscape would be bottlenecked with baseline comparison API requests than a full AI automated network. I have some ideas to do this currently that involves a hacky method, but I think it could at least give a POC. I digress. I think though, this bring up the matter of how much should I invest in deep learning, machine learning, AI if I stay on the network automation track?

                              <span>hello, 
 im looking to do radius auth from meraki wifi / dashboard to an on prem radius server.
 The AP&#x27;s will run in proxy mode since the wifi network is completely separate from the corporate network and thus &quot;local mode&quot; from AP direct to RADIUS server across the LAN is not possible. 
 would it be deemed secure enough to have a destination NAT on the firewall to a RADIUS server in the DMZ, providing only meraki dashboard IP&#x27;s and RADIUS protocol were permitted to access it?
 ​
 thanks

                              <span>Our remote work force uses Cisco 1815 teleworker access points to establish capwap over the internet. These allow POE to the desk phones at employees remote location and drop the phones/client traffic back off at our DC. We have seen tons of strange EAP fragment issues with random amounts of workers(nothing consistent). Could this be the CAPWAP latency requirement causing this? The clients do Radius-EAP-TLS authentication to an ISE deployment next to the WLC 5520.

                              <span>Has anyone experienced Dell laptops not responding to DOT1X Auth? There seems to be an issue with select models that will authenticate as long as you are active. Remove the smart card and be gone so long that is naps and subsequently seems to ignore the switch trying to do DOT1X Auth. Eventually the Auth is failed and the MAC is removed from the switch.
 User returns to reinsert smart card, wakes screen to log in, but no network connectivity. User has to reboot to acquire network access again. 
 Not all users or Dell models have this issue. It is an enterprise network, but I am told only 1 site is affected. Hmm

                              <span>And just in general how typically fragmentation goes? Ofc TCP is stream, but realistically I feel there is no way client/server hello get sliced midway through, since they are rendered whole at once, so there is no time for TCP to slice. Also there is nothing in the TCP buffer that is waiting to be send when connection is open. 
 (zero rtt is not considered. assume message does not exceed TCP segment max size)
 Edit: En-route to work, will answer everyone in an hour or two. A lot of useful info! Thanks everyone
 Edit2: Thank you, everyone. Yeah, there is no reason not to buffer incoming messages. I think these suboptimizations are just not worth it.

                              <span>I&#x27;m in a situation where there are 2 routers where 2 different ISPs terminate. Each one advertises our BGP prefix. On the inside, however, it&#x27;s just HSRP. Outbound traffic goes to the VIP. When one of the ISPs goes down, if that particular router happens to be the HSRP primary the internet will go down. I can restore it if I increase the priority on the other ISP router, but this is a manual intervention.
 Is there a better approach than this design or anything that can be done to improve it? As far as I&#x27;m aware, HSRP has no ability to do anything like route path monitoring.
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;ve heard stories of people who&#x27;ve switched their careers from working as engineers or support into Sales. I can imagine the experience and the knowledge accumulated definitely helped. I was wondering:
 Have you had any challenges in making this transition?

 I got a few switches that don&#x27;t support Netflow. Cisco is telling me to configure SPAN and aim it to the IP address of our flow collectors. The collectors are remote to the sites in question. 
 I&#x27;m a bit confused here. I&#x27;ve done span from port to port but not to a remote IP. Would anyone be willing to shed some light on how to get this done? DO i just do SPAN and point it to the upstream palo alto/ firewall that is running netflow monitoring?

 In the FTP graph, why is there such a high change of the interarrival time being high? I understand that in TELNET the time is usually high because its interactive and the user takes time to type, but in FTP shouldnt the packets just be sent quickly one after another. If the interarrival is high doesnt it indicate congestion

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to configure a pair of firewalls running Vyos, gw01 and gw02. Each firewall has a ptp OSPF link to the edge router, edge-gw01.
 gw01 and gw02 are configured with vrrp for the LAN gateway addresses (6 subnets). 3 of those subnets have a stateful firewall, so conntrack-sync is configured between gw01 and gw02.
 My problem is that both gw01 and gw02 advertise the LAN subnets via OSPF to edge-gw01, but for the subnets with stateful fw, traffic must go to the current vrrp master. 
 What is the best way to ensure edge-gw01 only imports routes for the LAN subnets from the current VRRP primary?
 EDIT: The vyous routers each have a /31 to the edge router. If I do nothing, the edge router sees two equal cost routes to LAN subnets, so there’s even chance that external packets hit the vyos that’s in vrrp backup state.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m experiencing a strange issue which doesn&#x27;t let me work with 25G DAC cables.
 So, I have Dell R740xd server with the following Network Adapter:
 Broadcom BCM57414 NetXtreme-E 10Gb/25Gb RDMA Ethernet Controller ( dual port )
 I&#x27;m using the following DAC cables:
  
SFP-H25G-CU3M
 SFP-H10GB-CU3M
  
The switch is Cisco Nexus 9K.
 So, when you connect 2 cables of 10G to the dual port adapter, everything work just fine, and both ports have links.
 But, when you connect for example, 10G cable on one port and 25G cable on the other port, only the first cable that is connected will get link.
 same goes for two 25G cables. if you connect just 1 cable of 25G, the port works fine (alone).
 The network card is high profile if it&#x27;s matter.
 we have tried to replace the network card to a brand new one, same issue.
 I checked with Dell, no hardware issues found. I checked with VMware, no software / configuration issues found.
 I didn&#x27;t check with Cisco yet.. maybe there is some kind of limitations on the network adapter? am I missing something? the cables are not supported?
 Edit: After I limited the port using &quot;speed 10000&quot; the port came up, but as 10G.
 Thanks!!

                              <span>I have an iPhone, and calling over Wi-Fi is turned on. My carrier is AT&amp;T and for any other Wi-Fi network it works.
 My school does block certain content, using methods including dns poisoning and reset attack(I believe through scanning dns packets and injecting reset packets if banned website is detected), dropping certain IP addresses, and port blocking(to block VPNs). 
 I believe that they do not have any other methods so far and I do not think they are trying to ban calling over Wi-Fi, and it is likely a side effect.
 However, even using a VPN to bypass the network restriction, calling over Wi-Fi still does not work. Why is that.?

My point is to stop anyone from installing the AnyConnect client on any device and trying to connect. Thank you for help.

                              <span>Hello, 
 ​
 we are a company distributed in 3 countries cca 3000 employees. We have to upgrade our WiFi controllers and APs on 2(smaller) of the 3 locations. Our network is currently entirely on Cisco.
 - 2 locations that are smaller ave cca 30-50 AP+ 2 controllers(Cisco 5508) - subscription expires this year
 - The main location has 216 AP + 2 controllers(Cisco 5520) - subscription expires end of next year
 On the smaller sites our subscriptions will expire. We will have to upgrade our old hardware. The problem is that management wants to change vendors. The IT(network) team wants to stay on Cisco. From our standpoint we would also agree to Aruba. But management wants Ruckus.
 This means that the vendor we chose for the smaller locations will also be coming to our main site with more than 200 AP.
 Does any one have any experience between the vendors Cisco, Aruba and Ruckus or any other enterprise vendor for a company of that size.
 Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.
 best regards

                              <span>Hey everyone, I am currently working on an RDS environment for a client and ran into a bit of a snag. 
 The short version is that the server broker for two RDSs running Win Server 2022 no longer want to load balance people to the second RDS. When disabling additional sign ins for RDS1, users get an error saying that there are no more servers within the server pool. I will note that previous to the issue I will get into, it worked otherwise. 
 The context to all of this is that while working on RDS2 I accidentally installed a broker on the RDS. After it was installed, I uninstalled it but afterward the RDS licenses were not working. After getting it paired back up with the licensing server RDS2 appeared fine but the broker refuses to load balance to it. 
 As of now, RDS2 can be RDP&#x27;d into directly via IP and there is no issue. While going through the broker though it places all users on RDS1. I previously tested it by signing in multiple users and I got as far as 10 users on RDS1 before I stopped. It just appears that something broke within the broker itself but I have no idea where to start. 
 I am very new to the sysadmin world and I have tried literally everything I could research. Are there any additional ideas I should try?

                              <span>I called in asking for help with a design issue on my new wordpress site. 
 After trying to figure it out for a while, he asked for my admin login credentials, to go in and try to test some things out. 
 I didn&#x27;t give him my actual personal admin login, but I did create a separate user with admin rights, and gave him that login info. 
 Right after the call I deleted the user login with admin rights I created for him. 
 Am I in any security risk? 
 It&#x27;s a brand new site, I&#x27;ll probably delete it and start over, but just wondering if the Hostgator support rep was actually trying to phish me, and if he could have seen any of my passwords somehow by having admin rights for 30 minutes.

                              <span>I’ve been at my job about 6 months now, IT is fairly young at this company, only had a department for 3 years now. We’ve stopped hiring until later this year and, as the title says, this past week our execs told IT leadership we need to show our value. We have a small team, and devops used to manage the IT side of things before IT was a department. I know our company is not afraid to outsource what they need as they do with customer service. I am trying to decide if it’s time to start looking only half a year into a job… I feel bed but if executives don’t see the value in IT now I don’t know what will change their minds

                              <span>hi all,
 we are able to have a security company come and do a vulnerability scan for our organization for the fire time. we are pretty up to date, MFA patching, controlled SOPs etc
 scope of the scan is basically everything infrastructure, switches, and servers. what else should I be expecting (social engineering test?) or things to be aware of or ready to be caught for?

 We probably have spare adapters, but this is a new one...
 Not really a technical question, but what limit are they talking about?
 Or are we dealing with a border agent who needed a &#x27;new&#x27; adapter?

Still a telecom team (so can&#x27;t add that to our team name) to handle customer needs (think call center or ivrs) but for employee day to day you&#x27;re handling what they used to.
 And changing the other team&#x27;s name is not an option.

                              <span>Long term Microsoft on-prem sysadm with 30 years of experience (Windows Server, AD, Exchange Server, SharePoint, Office Online, etc.). We are moving to the cloud with Azure AD P2 and Office 365 Business Premium. If I were to start educating myself on these cloud offerings from Microsoft, with the goal of getting certified even, where would I start? is it better to start learning the Office 365 platform first? before venturing into Azure stuff? or should i focus on the Azure ecosystem for starters? I know the two are linked in many ways. I believe we are planning to move to Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, OneDrive, Azure AD, etc. Any maybe look at things like Intune as well. 
 Oh, and does Microsoft have an official education platform these days? I haven&#x27;t done this in over a decade so I don&#x27;t even know where to start. This seems like the right place: Microsoft Certifications | Microsoft Learn

                              <span>Hi guys
 I&#x27;m just trying to figure this out - but almost everything I&#x27;m seeing on the web is coming up about server editions, rather than the underlying hardware.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve been asked to start the process to getting us compliant and certified with Cyber Essentials (not +) - and it&#x27;s come to my attention that their recently installed DC [done just before I joined the team] almost every piece of hardware in there is EOL.
 Despite the hardware being EOL, they&#x27;re all running the latest editions of Windows Server.
 Does the hardware support lifecycle bare any relevance to Cyber Essentials, or are we genuinely expected to recycle our servers every 4-5 years?
 I&#x27;m mindful that our SAN - which is only managed internally but is on a subnet that can make outgoing Internet access - may be considered in-scope, and this was EOL in 2020.
 Has anyone undertaken this task? Do we have to rebuild the DC with newer kit after only 7 months just to attain compliance?
 ​
 EDIT: Worth noting our DC is where our VPN is hosted - as well as all of our core servers. Our office premise have a site-to-site into the DC. 
 Cheers

 What are your thoughts?

                              <span>Currently redesigning our OU structure and I feel we might be opting to go for a less than ideal OU structure that was proposed by a co worker given our requirements. I personally feel his has unnecessary OUs for the sake of having OUs and was only suggested to make our to AD look &quot;tidy&quot;.
 Main Design Considerations:
  
1200 Users.
 10 different locations.
 Users are rotated between departments and even locations somewhat frequently.
  
GPOs currently include:
  
Folder Redirection depending on location
 Proxy GPO depending on location
 Printer Mapping depending on department
 Shared Folder Mapping depending on department
  
Co worker design: Currently there is a general OU for all PCs so I assume he&#x27;s planning to keep that as is
  -&gt;Location A OU --&gt; Finance OU ---&gt;Marketing OU (which contains only users and shared folder) --&gt; HR OU -&gt; Location B OU --&gt; IT OU 
 I had suggested that we keep a simple flat structure: 
 -&gt; Location A OU Users objects of users belonging to location A -&gt; Location B OU Users objects of users belonging to location B -&gt; Computers OU --&gt; Servers ---&gt; Location A ---&gt; Location B --&gt; Desktops ---&gt; Location A ---&gt; Location B 
 The main reason for such a simple layout is due to there not being some major difference across departments that would require separate OUs. The main difference between departments at locations is their shared folder mappings and printers, which can be managed by groups instead of OUs. My main concern is that due to the frequent staff rotation, persons are going to have to be moved to the new location OU and be added to their respective department groups every few months to receive their location and department specific GPOs. Is there a structure that gets around this or is just a problem that should be solved with automation?

 I dread to think that script kiddies and cyber criminals will now be able to commit their deeds even more easily. While many private persons, employees and authorities already have problems with worse fishing mails and generally too many private persons, companies and authorities are very much behind in IT issues.
 At the same time, it also offers many opportunities for us, the good side. We can have our code checked again fully automatically, have good templates created, have alternative approaches to our problems,...

I&#x27;m on vacation in Thailand for 3 months, sure to return March 1st and my boss/father as it&#x27;s a family business is saying if the network issue we are having can&#x27;t be fixed with me talking them through it on the phone I might have to fly home to Canada to make sure it gets fixed. I&#x27;m pretty confident I can get it done over the phone but if I have to come back to Canada and then return to Thailand a few days or a week later, on their dime of course, what kind of compensation do you folks think would be fair?

                              <span>There&#x27;s always a weak link, right? Even if it&#x27;s only stuck in your head rather than causing a genuine issue in your environment. Something you just can&#x27;t make feel reliable enough.
 NTP springs to mind, but that&#x27;s why NTP was invented right? Wasn&#x27;t about time syncing, it was always about being confusing and vague.
 And whilst I&#x27;m not a DBA, that&#x27;s always been a right pain in projects I&#x27;ve engaged with, and understandably so, especially at scale.

 I have installed Apache Guacamole with this tutorial: https://computingforgeeks.com/install-guacamole-remote-desktop-on-ubuntu-jammy-jellyfish/, 
 and everything was okay until I started the Web UI page for log-in, the username and Password didn&#x27;t work, I think the issue was with the &quot; user-mapping.xml &quot; I have to change it too many times but it still stuck on it { Invalid Login}

 I&#x27;m currently delivering free training on the full CompTIA A+ course. The course consists of 20 modules and I will creating a dedicated video for each module. Some of these videos might be a bit long since each video covers a whole module after all.
 I add time stamps in each video for you convenience if your only looking for something specific in a module or only want to refresh on a certain topic so please feel free to make use of them.
 There will be 22 videos for this course, the first is just the 6 min intro explaining the course, the last will be a dedicated exam tips video and then obviously the 18 videos in between will be your modules with the actual course.
 The training should be enough to pass both the international exams for A+ and the other courses I deliver sho…</span>

 I have a lot of files that have been zipped into a WinRar archive. There should be folders and files within it. However, when I open up the winrar archive, there&#x27;s only a massive single file. How do I revert it back to a state where it&#x27;s the folders and files again?

 Then Intune became part of Endpoint Manager
 Now Microsoft has renamed the entire Endpoint Manager to Intune (Oct 2023)
 Did the Xbox people suddenly get in charge of naming everything?

                              <span>Hello, great people of sysadmin, I have a job interview on Monday for an Azure Sys Admin position and I can handle myself in Azure just fine. Still, I have never migrated an Onprem location to the cloud. Since I came to my current position where I have been for over a year as an Azure Cloud Admin, we have been on a merger freeze (the company usually buys dozens of small companies a year) and thus I have no experience there. This new job will focus a lot on mergers to the cloud and I wanted to see what are some things that need to be done to onboard an on-premise environment into the cloud or some literature/video for how-to&#x27;s would be awesome. And just some general tips to ace this interview, usually pretty nervous in interviews.

                              <span>tl;dr: I feel like the quality of this sub is degrading because people can’t stop being dicks to each other.
 Back in the day, we used to have mailing lists (e.g. Groupstudy), IRC chat, and web forums as avenues for network engineers to have technical discussions. Today the only visage left is Reddit and arguably Discord. More so, though, it seems the general attitude of everyone has changed from “Let’s discuss this, and I can help you clear up your confusion” to “I’m right, and watch me prove you wrong.” Sometimes this manifests itself as negative comments, but more often than not it’s downvotes.
 Now I don’t know about you guys, but I’m not on this sub for fake Internet points. Instead, I’d rather have meaningful conversations about networking, where I can potentially teach others about aspects of technology they don’t already know, and likewise, learn new things myself. Unfortunately, though, I find that pretty much no matter what people post, the peanut gallery is right there to shut them down.
 Three separate threads I replied to over this weekend with what I would consider helpful answers were deleted by the OPs, because they were getting hammered with replies to the effect of “wow you’re fucking dumb; go read your CCNA books again”.
 Is this really what we want to portray to people trying to get into this industry? Two mantras I’ve always told my students over the past 20+ years are that “the more you learn, the more you realize you don’t know”, and that “there are no stupid questions, only stupid people.”
 C’mon people, we’re better than this. Aren’t we all working towards the same goal of global communication?

                              <span>Wondering if anyone out there has a pair or more of these switches in an IRF stack.
 I&#x27;ve had an issue with mine discarding thousands of packets on the IRF ports within a matter of minutes. I have replicated this issue on a pair of spare switches. It only seems to affect the 12XGT models that we own and none of the other 1950 models.
 I&#x27;ve contacted Aruba/HP support about this and they are not helping much. I&#x27;m trying to figure out if it&#x27;s me or the firmware/hardware.

                              <span>Hey All,
 Looking for some advice on the following:
 I have been asked to look at replacement of our aging aruba switching at some of our sites. Our sites are a mixed bag with Meraki MX&#x27;s for SD-wan, Meraki for AP&#x27;s and Aruba for switching. For the next few years i don&#x27;t see us swapping out Meraki access points and or the SD-WAN. A big issue we face at the moment is visibility in the switch space with no central management. 
 I have had limited experience with Aruba, however the AOS is simple enough and the switching has been solid from what i have been told. I have not touched CX
 I have plenty of Meraki experience, mostly good besides the shortcomings of their firewall product.
 In the future, we need to implement 802.1x on our wired ports (Already implemented on Wifi) and would like to …</span>

 I found this post with my same question but the solution was to use DHCP to point the phone to the correct VLAN - which unfortunately won&#x27;t work for as we need to utilize different VLANs. 
 Has anyone had experience with this?

 Please see the attached topology. I have configured 2 VC between PE01 &amp; PE02, each connected to one switch over 2 trunk links each side. All VLANs are allowed on the trunks from the switches and I am able to ping from one switch SVI to the SVI of the switch on other side of l2vpn using both vlans. But spanning tree shows both switch are root bridge for each vlan and none of the ports are being blocked. l2vpn is configured in port port. Why is this behavior? 
 vlan being used for SVI 200, 300.

 I think my NAT router is adding an entry in the NAT that allows the ftp server on port 20 to connect to the address specified in PORT. Is this common? Is this even possible? How else would the server be able to do an active open on my host behind a address and port dependent filtering NAT?

                              <span>Hi r/networking, I&#x27;m working on a (next gen) firewall solution for a data center (expected ~15k campus users).
 The specs require physical firewalls as opposed to virtual. 
 Vendors I&#x27;m currently looking at are: CISCO, Forcepoint, Checkpoint, Palo Alto, Fortinet
 I need to suggest 3 vendors based on technical and commercial viability (budget isn&#x27;t that tight, but we&#x27;d prefer a cheaper solution if the difference in quality isn&#x27;t really all that). 
 I&#x27;ve been looking at their documentation and data sheets and they all seem to have practically the same features, more or less. 
 ​
  
Is there any clear winner among these? What differentiates them in terms of features and performance? They all seem to have the core capabilities of an NGFW: Packet Filtering (Layers 3 &amp; 4), VPN, Stateful Inspection, Application Visibility &amp; Control, Threat Intelligence, IPS.
 Relevant 3rd party benchmarks I&#x27;m looking at: Gartner and Cyber Ratings. Should these suffice? Which one should I prioritize? I&#x27;ve heard Cyber Ratings is more relevant since they actually test the hardware.
 Any other reliable sources that can help me evaluate and choose?
 I&#x27;ve heard Palo Alto is the gold standard, but is pricey (they reached out and said we can negotiate), and Fortinet is the most cost-effective and up-and-coming vendor. Is that true? 
 I&#x27;m currently leaning towards Forcepoint, since they are making some compelling arguments. They seem to have the best Firewall performance. Some of the main points they mentioned about their NGFW&#x27;s include: 
 Best malicious signature detection, therefore best IPS/IDS. Apparently this is the most important metric to gauge a firewall&#x27;s performance?
 Active-Active clustering for high availability 
 Best in the market to protect against evasion attacks
 
  
​
 I would highly appreciate any and all insights based on your experiences and research! I know there&#x27;s a lot I wrote down, but really need the help. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi
 this might be silly for you but I really could&#x27;t find a way to solve it.
 Our small office is like this: All computers &gt; our switch (TP-Link TL-SG2428P) &gt; neighbor unmanaged switch &gt; ISP router.
 ​
 * we couldn&#x27;t change this topology for now !
 ​
 Everything is running for our users, but I am concered that our computers and theirs are in one network, and this is not good for security in the first place.
 ​
 So I have tried to create a new vlan for our computers, but the result is disconnection from internet !
 ​
 Each thought is valued : )

 Hi guys! 
 I’ve been struggling with this one.
 AD join Azure virtual desktops are failing to join the domain when deployed in the host pool or even manually I get the above message. 
 Things I have checked:
 DNS server in the VNET, set to custom, all matches the domain controller and can ping it.
 Disabled the lockout GPO for the admin and still getting that message.
 Any idea why I’m still getting that error message? What am I missing?
 I appreciate any thoughts. 
 Thanks

                              <span>Issue: I have Power BI reports that have automatic refreshes scheduled. Sometimes I get messages that my reports have failed to refresh. The failure details are: The last refresh attempt failed because of an internal service error. This usually a transient issue. I never get this issue for the same report back-to-back. If I were to manually refresh the report it would refresh no problem. The problem is random automatic refresh failures. 
 Details: My Power BI files and data sources are located in SharePoint. My Gateway is running on an Azure VM which has access to the ODBC connections needed to connect to the tables where the data is originally located.
 Has anyone come across the same issue? Do you have any idea how to minimize these failures?

 I&#x27;m having trouble figuring out if there is a way to NOT allow passwordless login with a FIDO2 key. For the absolute best security, I&#x27;m looking to require a complex password AND use a FIDO2 key (instead of OTP/notification/text/etc) as the 2nd factor, for admins. Is this possible?

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m done with my nerves and I hope to find help here. I hope, I&#x27;m right in this sub. I have 2 Exchange accounts - the first one is administrated by the IT department of my current employer. We recently started a small business and set up an own M365-Instance. So far everything seems to work properly.
 Currently we have only 2 active users, some external contacts and some groups. Now the strange behaviour:
  
When searching the directory from my iphone - everything is fine - I find the items
 In the &quot;people&quot;-tab, I can see all groups, contacts and users (Outlook Web Version)
 BUT: No matter what I type in into the &quot;To&quot;-Field in Outlook (Doesn&#x27;t matter if Mac-Version or Webapp) I always get the message &quot;No results found&quot; - It doesn&#x27;t matter, if I use my own name, the Account of my coworker or any of the groups. The result ist always: No results found
 If I use the same browser/mac client for the M365-Account of my current employer, everything can be found, as soon as I type in the &quot;to&quot;-field. Even if I hit the &quot;x&quot; to remove them from the suggestions, the entries from the directory are always displayed instantly
  
Please tell me, that I am just to stupid to find the right settings to activate. I searched for hours now :-(
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Just wanted to let everyone know about an issue I found in the latest as well as the previous firmware version for the VVX250. The issue does not effect older models that I recently upgraded from such as the VVX411.
 I believe the issue is related to the &quot;voIpProt.SIP.requestValidation.x.method&quot; setting defaulting to &quot;Static&quot; instead of &quot;Null&quot;. This is due to the error in the phone logs stating(when log set to debug): CUser::OnEvRequest CANCEL from unregistered source &#x27;x.x.x.x&#x27; trying another user.. 
 The issue is as follows:
 You make a call and it rings on the phone. This call comes from x.x.x.x
 While the call is ringing the phone updates registration and now binds to y.y.y.y
 Call ends and the phone gets a properly formed CANCEL packet from x.x.x.x 
 Call is not canceled and the phone …</span>

                              <span>This is not going to be fun. I have spent the last 2 weeks working on our VMware environment to prepare going to vSphere 7 form 6.7. We had 1 server that was still running 6, but I have not been able to upgrade it as it was mission critical and could not be taken down for any amount of time, not even for patches. So I used a spare server to use as a temporary host to upgrade the 6 server to 6.7. After a lot of headaches and manually installing storage and network firmware patches, got that done in prep to upgrade to 7. Oh well, I was afraid this was going to happen but I had to try anyway. Deployed a new vcenter 7 server and started the upgrades. we have 7 hosts, 3 of them will not support 7. They where not on the list of supported servers but 1 was not on the list of servers for 6.7 and t…</span>

My company only use OEM win 10 with e5 subscription so we don&#x27;t have such iso on our VSLC site. I tried the evaluation iso from MS website but script wouldn&#x27;t accept since version is different too.
 Any one has idea where I could find one?

 It apparently stopped working in 2021, and they haven&#x27;t been able to turn the lights off since. Instead of making the existing software work again, they are replacing the entire lighting system...

                              <span>Howdy All!
 Last week, I installed the 2211 update for WAC.
 I did initial testing on a subset of servers, and everything seemed ok.
 Last night, we were doing our monthly patch cycle, and we could connect to exactly one server -- the WAC gateway itself.
 Anyone seeing similar behavior? Got any insight as to changes MS may have dropped that broke it?
 ​
 Thanks all!

 **** Found the problem!!

 ​
 I had to run the installer to get the update to go, and I must&#x27;ve flagged SSL for WinRM
 ​
 Turned off the registry setting and poof.. connections abound!

                              <span>Hi all, long story short I got laid off last month after working help desk for a couple of years, before that I&#x27;ve had various somewhat-related IT jobs. I picked up a few CompTIA certs while doing help desk and started throwing my resume at everything with a pulse since my layoff. Lo and behold a small Healthcare company brought me in for an interview for a Sysadmin position (my dream job), something I felt highly unqualified for but thought hey what the heck! Well apparently they liked my resume, and I interviewed well enough, that they offered me the position! My feelings of elation and optimism were quickly replaced with dread, &quot;what if I completely bomb it&quot;?
 My last job was basically me working tickets from helpdesk and SOMETIMES using RDP to connect to servers to restart services, and perform various minor tasks. It suddenly dawned on me that I actually have pretty much no experience Administrating Systems! Cool! This is the most I&#x27;ve ever been paid, and it&#x27;s a great IT position in an area where these jobs are few and far between (20 minutes from a small suburb in West Virginia, yay I live in the middle of nowhere). 
 Can some of you guys give me some encouragement? Or give me some confirmation bias that I&#x27;m going to get fired on Week 1? Anyone else find themselves in a role like this with a similar story? Thanks guys.

 The issue started on December 19th and approx 7PM.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve loved scripting for years now. I know a little python but Powershell is my bread and butter. I&#x27;ve written close to 13,000 lines of code in powershell over the years so I feel pretty confident in it. For whatever reason, I just assumed that git always needed a command line interface to work with and that it wasn&#x27;t worth the hastle to use. I thought you had to install a linux subsystem on your windows computer just to even work with it. So I just opted to store my scripts on onedrive and would just use ISE to edit scripts all the time. 
 Last night I decided to see what all the fuss was about with visual studio code and wow I feel like an idiot now. You can literally just have a version controlled, central repository of scripts, all in a nice GUI at your fingertips on any computer. Don&#x27;t be like me, it&#x27;s honestly pretty easy.

                              <span>Since november we have a lot of connection timeouts in our citrix servers. Our customers have either a black or gray screen when they open their citrix workplace. Workaround is to close all processes in task manager and to manually sign out the session in the director by the service desk.
 No one has a clue yet. Anyone who suffered from that since november?

                              <span>What strategies do you use to deploy Windows Feature Updates? Currently, we use a SCCM task sequence and it does the job, and we&#x27;ve been able to customize quite a bit of it. However, I feel Intune might be a better route but from what I understand Intune doesn&#x27;t push the update out to machines. Instead the policy can be used to customize how a machine behaves for windows updates that are pulled in another fashion, WSUS for example.

 What&#x27;s your opinion on pass-through RJ45s? I&#x27;ve heard somewhere that they can create shorts at the ends and are thus ill-advised. I need some new connectors for my toolkit, and passthroughs look like a tempting offer, but I don&#x27;t want to compromise reliability for a bit of convenience. Thoughts?

 ​
 ​
 DC&#x27;s are 2016 as is functional level.
 ​
 DCs are 2016.
 ​
 We have a legacy systems like XP,2000,2003,2008 server.
 ​
 I know everyone says to decom the old servers, but our go live to replace them is like First week of april
 ​
 I have not applied the patches to our DC. I also our network security:configure encryption types allowed GPO is NOT defined.
 ​
 ​
 My questions are :
 ​
 1 - Lets say , when applying Microsoft&#x27;s January patch it would break the Kerberos authentication for Legacy OSes ? 
 ​
 2 - In ADUC, can I resolve the issue by explictly setting RC4 (0x4 (RC4_HMAC_MD5)) in msDS-SupportedEncryptionTypes for the computer objects of the target ( legacy OS) ?
 ​
 3- I have noticed that when I run the script I get a report that There are 63 objects that do not have AES K…</span>

                              <span>Hi guys, 
 We have EOP and Defender for Office 365 plan 1 in place. I have blocked a domain that was spamming our HR department. The emails are sent to [HR@domain.com](mailto:HR@domain.com), and a mail forwarding rule is in place that forwards the emails to an HR SaaS solution. 
 I noticed the emails from the blocked domain are still delivered to the SaaS solution. After reproducing the issue, I came to the conclusion that blocked domains (and maybe more of the security?) are bypassed when mails are forwarded to outside the organization. 
 I created a ticket with Microsoft, but no response yet. Have you guys ever seen something similar? 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Needing a secure way to send sensitive personal data to a company who requires fax (not accepting email nor secure file dropoff station online). I know a fax machine doesn&#x27;t send encrypted data over telephone lines (at least I think I know this). 
 But here is eFax claiming in a few links they encrypt data in transit. Are they being fast and loose with this wording, where it&#x27;s encrypted in transit ONLY outside of the physical fax machines involved? I assume this means only if both ends of the transmission are using their services, right? Seems like very misleading marketing messaging as I assume vast majority of users don&#x27;t use efax end-to-end.
 Can someone confirm if I understand correctly or what I&#x27;m wrong about?

                              <span>So back in February 2022 I started talks with Lumens about replacing AT&amp;T as my SD-WAN provider and single pane of glass internet billing for all my 28 sites. Well it’s now January 2023 and not a single site is on Lumens yet. It’s been delays after delay with them not being able to get hardware in etc etc and now my account rep is outie, the new guy is a ghost so far.
 My question for my fellows is how the hell can I get out of this damn contract now that it’s a year with no end in sight. I’ll read my contracts and agreements but was hoping someone here has been through this kind of mid install cancel due to no delivery. I just want to find someone who can actually execute the services.

                              <span>Yes, you read the title well, here is the context: I got some kind of lab (so don&#x27;t worry it&#x27;s completely legal and supervised) and I have to exploit anything I can imagine and an IMPORTANT thing is that I only have access to CMD on this Windows XP machine because I have accessed through a msfconsole exploit.
 So I think I&#x27;ve changed &quot;Administrator&quot; password with net user Administrator 123 (and just in case I: net user Adminstrator /active:yes) and now I don&#x27;t know how to log as this user on CMD prompt because there is not a su root command in Windows (at least to my knowledge).
 Could you advise me what to do? I need to log as Administrator because only this user can access to a restricted file with data I need to go on.
 Or should I try some kind of privilege escalation stuff?
 Any case thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi,
 Maybe it has been asked before, sorry for bothering you in that case.
 We have a backup solution that has 2 copies of every backup: One on-site, the other in another physical location. Backup network is in it&#x27;s own VLAN and the secondary location uses a physical server as iSCSI target for an immutable storage partition. 
 How do you guys accomplish off-line backup?
 Tapes can be used offcourse, but in a previous job they used tapes and the units were unreliable, therefor the backups as well and the job of chaging the tapes, well one should think there would be better solutions nowadays.
 Do you consider cloud storage as off-line backup?
 Do you use other smart solutions to make sure your backups cannot be reached from your internal network?

                              <span>Hello, Recently I&#x27;ve finished adding users to the domain. It&#x27;s time to domain join the computers of our IT team. My idea is: Add us to the following security groups: - Account Operators - GP Creator Owners - Event Log Readers
 And to the group managing LAPS.
 This way, we can have access to RSAT, to perform daily AD tasks; access to LAPS, to perform help desk tasks requiring elevated privileges. What do you guys think? Maybe you have a better idea? Thanks!

                              <span>Disclaimer: I&#x27;m a few cocktails in, so forgive this post.
 For nearly two decades I&#x27;ve been IT for what started as a family business, but grew into something significantly larger. Because the family member who started it was allergic to the optics of nepotism, I wasn&#x27;t an employee, but rather encouraged to start my own business. Background: I hate Windows. My training, experience, expertise and history is in *nix servers, but my family had a business and needed IT help, so I helped. And what started as remotely helping make choices and advising a local technician (who would reformat a Dell PC with a legit license with pirated Windows because it had the settings he liked) resulted in a nearly twenty year stint as a &quot;consultant.&quot; I even moved all the way across the country to help. At first, the family business was too small for a full-time IT Guy, so I wasn&#x27;t hurt when I wasn&#x27;t hired on ... I just found other clients. But of course the demands and the work expanded to fill the available time - even though the contract didn&#x27;t keep pace.
 Anyway, I never wanted to be a Windows admin. I never wanted to do this for a career, and finally - as of today - I&#x27;m done. 
 Next week, I start a job doing what I used to love doing - we&#x27;ll see if I still like it - but for now, it&#x27;s a real relief to be done with email problems, Microsoft licensing, and fucking printers. I&#x27;d have written more, but the sub has a rule against throw-away accounts. 
  
Drink a glass with me, /r/sysadmin, here&#x27;s to actually having benefits, getting paid what you&#x27;re worth, and doing what you like to do.

                              <span>Hey everyone
 Wondering if anyone can help with a precision t5600
 the PSU was replaced from a 635, and got a 685watt instead... Now at boot pre-post there is a prompt saying the power supply is not the one originally configured for this machine blah blah blah. Press F1 to boot, f2 for setup, etc..
 How can I get ride of that prompt? Are there pins or something I can jump. There is nothing in the bios that will allow me to turn it off, like you typically can on a consumer bios. 
 I can&#x27;t seem to find anything online...
 Essentially need to remove it as every time it boots/restarts it prompts that and needs F1 pressed before it continues to boot which will make it useless as a headless server. 
 Thanks in advance
 Pic of the prompt for reference.

                              <span>Hey everyone, 2012R2 is quickly dying and we need to upgrade our FlexLM license server to 2016 or 2019. We dont have a triad and are only using a single license server. All the licenses are locked to the mac and software is tied to the hostname so I need MAC + Hostname to stay the same. Anyone tried an in place upgrade for Windows on these? Any other recommendation about how to do this easily?
 Thanks!

                              <span>I have a Cisco Catalyst 2960X switch that has a single drop going to an inconvenient location. At the end of that single drop is an unmanaged, 8-port desktop gigabit switch. That switch is unmanaged, but passes tagged frames through it unmolested. There are six devices on that switch that don&#x27;t know how to emit tagged frames themselves, and need to talk on the same VLAN. That&#x27;s obvious - switchport access vlan 57 would do the trick.
 But there&#x27;s one device there that needs to be on VLAN 69. It can emit tagged frames, so configuring the port like so would seem right: switchport mode trunk switchport trunk native vlan 57 switchport trunk allowed vlan 57,69 
 But, the conundrum is this: how do I keep devices other than the one that&#x27;s meant to be talking on VLAN 69, from doing so on that port? It seems straightforward to use a MAC access-list, except that there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to apply it only for frames tagged for VLAN 69. The devices on VLAN 57 are subject to change, so enumerating their MAC addresses is a giant pain.
 What I&#x27;d like is this - permit any host to send untagged frames, which end up on VLAN 57. Permit only one authorized host to send tagged frames; if they&#x27;re tagged for anything but VLAN 69 then the allowed vlan config should take care of it. Is there a straightforward way to do this on a 2960x without either enumerating all the authorized devices for VLAN 57, using dot1x, or putting a managed switch down there?

                              <span>Hey,
 New to network automation, I want to make sure my lab and processes are as close to the real world as possible. Currently I have a jinja2 template and variable file per device e.g. R1.yaml / R1.j2 , my inventory is through netbox api.
 Any update to the host yaml file triggers a ci/cd pipeline to do pre-configuration checks/validation, and post configuration checks/validation.
 This is cool with my small setup but how would this scale in a large enterprise ? My initial thought would be to have a yaml file for every single device ? What&#x27;s the proper file structure that scales well ? How are you guys in the real world doing it ?
 ​
 Thanks!!

                              <span>Small IT team covering everything, knowledgeable on networking but no expert.
 I&#x27;m trying to plan how to best configure a second L2 network link between our two sites without inadvertently creating a network loop, and where I cannot use spanning tree.
 We have two sites, each has connectivity via upstream provider which is part of the same organisation but separate (so we manage our own networking but don&#x27;t have access to the upstream network), and we also use a bonded 2 x 1Gb Q-in-Q L2 tunnel over the upstream backbone connection to carry shared VLANs between sites.
 I now have a 10Gb dark fibre linking the sites directly, which I&#x27;ve initially configured with a single access VLAN to test connectivity but want to now configure as a trunk and gradually move the internal VLANs from the existing link to the new, ideally keeping the old link in place as a backup, or for less important traffic. The Q-in-Q tunnel strips out spanning tree packets. While I would remove a VLAN from the existing tunnel before adding it to the new link, I can&#x27;t do that with the native VLAN 1, which would be present on both links and, without STP, would likely cause a loop.
 To further complicate things for me slightly, I&#x27;m running older Cisco kit at the first site (3850s at the core) and Ruckus at the second site (ICX 7650s) so configuration isn&#x27;t just a copy/paste. Each site is its own spanning tree domain, so I&#x27;d be wanting to enable bpdufilter on the links anyway.
 Would setting the native VLAN on the new link to something other than default VLAN 1 solve this? Or should I bite the bullet, configure all the VLANs on the new link and simply shut down the old and enable the new, and be ready to switch back if it doesn&#x27;t come up as expected? Or is there another approach? I&#x27;d prefer to do some more testing first, running the link as a trunk carrying a couple of test VLANs, but not causing a network loop is more important!
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello,
 I have an issue which I was not able to solve.
 EdgeRouter (Lite v2.0.9-hotfix.5) with Eth1 - static IP address ( public) and 5 VLANs on Eth2 eth2.100 to eth2.105.
 Internet (masquerade) works well on all the existing VLANs, excepting the latest addition eth2.105 (10.0.5.0/24).
 Nothing goes out to the internet from this VLAN eth2.105.
 5003 MASQ eth1 saddr ANY to 81.x.y.z
 proto-all sport ANY
 on the edgerouter I captured the icmp ping packets coming from a host to 1.1.1.3
 user@router1:~$ sudo tcpdump -i eth2.105 -n -vvv icmp
 tcpdump: listening on eth2.105, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes
 13:36:14.345937 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 60458, offset 0, flags [DF], proto ICMP (1), length 84)
 10.0.5.10 &gt;
 1.1.1.3: ICMP echo request, id 9, seq 50, length 64
 13:36:15.346112 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 61092, offset 0, flags [DF], proto ICMP (1), length 84)

 13:36:16.346278 IP (tos 0x0, ttl 64, id 61596, offset 0, flags [DF], proto ICMP (1), length 84)
 No reply !
 I have a S2S tunnel to this location and I can reach out to all IPs belonging to this VLAN.
 I can ping from the VLAN subnet Edgerouter management interface.
 Any advice how to further troubleshoot?
 Thanks

                              <span>From RFC 1122:
  
When a connection is closed actively, it MUST linger in TIME-WAIT state for a time 2xMSL (Maximum Segment Lifetime). However, it MAY accept a new SYN from the remote TCP to reopen the connection directly from TIME-WAIT state, if it:
 (1) assigns its initial sequence number for the new connection to be larger
 than the largest sequence number it used on the previous connection
 incarnation
  
Why would you ever allow this?
 What if the server accepts the new SYN for a connection in TIME-WAIT state, and then the server starts sending data so fast that the sequence number wraps, and now there could be a duplicate segment from the old connection with the same sequence number? Is this not possible?

                              <span>Hello /r/sysadmin,
 I&#x27;m a desktop systems engineer in a mixed Mac/Windows shop. We have a hybrid AD/Azure environment. On-prem AD is still the primary, and source of truth. Though I am not on the team that manages Azure AD, I have an Azure role assignment of &quot;Contributor&quot; and an RBAC user role of &quot;Service Support Administrator.&quot;
 During the first week of January, I did a search in the console and exported some users to a CSV, about 4,000 people, for a phased software rollout we&#x27;re doing later this month and into February. I realized that I was missing some fields that would have helped me subdivide the list into smaller chunks for pilot testing, so I put it aside and came back to it later. 
 I made a bunch of filtered searches and saved the hyperlinks for each division of the larger set th…</span>

                              <span>I’m in an office where people are used to pressing easy buttons. They walk up to your desk, blurt out their issue and go on with their day, while you’re missing out on information and trying to keep track of all these little things. I picked up a pack of those NFC tags on Amazon, and wrote the link to our ticket portal on it. So now when they walk up to my desk with all this, I tell them to hold their phone to the little circle by my desk, and bam, gives them a quick way to do thing I ask them to all the time. Pretty much everyone in our office has newer iPhones, so as long as their phone isn’t on low power mode and unlocked it’ll work without opening anything/settings changes. And once they have the ticket form open? 80% of the time, it works every time.

                              <span>I started as a Sysadmin almost 9 years ago exactly. This was my last full week as a titled Sysadmin. Thanks to the helpful comments, technical knowledge and support from this sub over the years I&#x27;ve been able to be great at my job and vastly expand my skillset, and helped me get this far. 
 After 9 years my manager, our IT Director for our small team of 4, is promoting me to IT Manager. (Actual title is &#x27;IT Network Infrastructure and Security Manager&#x27;). 90% of what my job is now, all our sysadmin duty basically, except actually having the title and salary for it as I&#x27;ve slowly taken a lot of the reins over from my director over the past few years. A bit more autonomy and less red tape for approvals. The biggest thing I will have two desktop support people under me, our existing one at another site, and I will be able to hire my own desktop support to assist me at my site, which will be GREAT since I am the solo on site IT for our site which is also our corporate HQ. This is a big step up resume having experience with reports and having a manager title... something good to look forward to! 
 25% raise right off the bat. 38%-44% if you factor in bonuses being written into my contract. 
 Thank you again.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been documenting architecture and classifying data across our infrastructure for a security audit, and found out $hiny New S****force application is not actually going to do half of what it was built for, will only increase the load on our on-prem infrastructure, and will make us MORE dependent on the mainframe it was set up to replace. The last time a project like this failed, I had to lock and confiscate the phones of multiple execs when the waste and failure was exposed, but this time bomb probably has at least another year left before it goes off and people get fired. And they&#x27;ve been misrepresenting all of this in meetings and demos for the past few years.
 I&#x27;m in the clear (completely different department, no connection to app dev), but this is going to end with people way way above me getting axed at some point. 
 What&#x27;s been the biggest project or planning f***up you&#x27;ve seen before?

Or if security pushes a change in the middle of the day and causes an outage, it’s frowned upon but heads don’t roll?

I don&#x27;t have the time to go to school and retrain because I&#x27;m old, have parental responsibilities and aging/dying relatives, have lots of medical issues myself, and have pretty depressed/discouraged about IT and pretty much my whole existence. I just dont have the go-get-em exuberance of youth anymore. I&#x27;m going to be ineffective and pale by comparison to my younger super-skilled coworkers. Dont need any advice. Just wondering if i&#x27;m the only one that feels like this... thank you.

                              <span>Apologies for the length, will include a TL;DR. Also on mobile, so on and so on. 
 So I’ve been with my company as an engineer less than a year. My position was advertised as hybrid. We were expected to complete the majority of our work remotely, and to go into the office only when absolutely necessary when hands on configuration of our equipment was needed, which was expected to be about a month total. We also periodically went into the office when vendors came by to do training or demos. Usually this training included a paid for dinner at an expensive restaurant. Having a $150 dry aged ribeye on the vendor’s dime meant that absolutely no one had any issues coming into the office for a day or two every couple of months. 
 The job was rewarding and refreshing compared to my previous ones. …</span>

                              <span>Happy Friday everyone. I&#x27;m a solo IT person. I manage 4 offices with about 70 employees. I work as the IT manager, IT security person, Helpdesk, system admin. I&#x27;ve been at this company for 17 years I find that I don&#x27;t have enough time to work on projects or even want to because my day is putting out small fires repeatedly. I make my own documents for people to fix things but they always ask As most of my day is fixing random BS tickets, password issues, mfa issues, work from home issues. I&#x27;m pretty good at getting people up and running in minutes usually. I don&#x27;t have any ticket back log. I just feel like I&#x27;m wasting my time. My stress level has been pretty bad lately and cause some medical issues (Dr thinks this)
 Is one person enough to handle all this? Am I just being a cry baby? I haven&#x27;t spoken to anyone about this. I think in my mind they just think I sit around and play WOW all day and i&#x27;m afraid to speak up. I&#x27;d like to hear from similar people. If you don&#x27;t want to post then please DM 
 Thanks IT gods

                              <span>Hey folks,
 Todays an odd day. I’ve worked with the company I’m still employed by for the last 10 years- I’ve gone from ‘helping out with computers’ as a side part of my role when I was 19 to being a solo sysadmin- for which I’ve been doing the duties for over the last 8 years.
 It’s a relatively small business- two facilities in a specialized part of the geriatric healthcare industry with roughly 125-150 users. Although I’ve worked hand in hand with an MSP for majority of that time I’m the only actual employee for the company who understands networking, the actual structure of our network, and most importantly I’m the only one who seems to understand how all the systems interact with each other including our SaaS components.

 System Administrator seems off as well since I handle the budgeting, creating security policies, planning and implementation of IT related projects. 
 Also, I&#x27;m scouting at other places and currently updating my LinkedIn... I&#x27;m getting a lot of recruiters messaging about an IT Manager position.. Again a problem since I have no managerial experience lol.. any suggestions for a title?

 We are a small company, and I am the sole admin. I just upgraded our licensing to include Intune and Azure AD P1 and had been working on basic policies and profiles for our devices which included some of the basic conditional access policies.
 I thought I was ahead of the game, by having already required number matching MFA in our tenant as a phishing-resistant MFA option. So when I saw the template, &quot;Require phishing-resistant MFA for all Admins&quot; template, I thought why not (I know better).

I just put in &quot;whatever.com&quot; in our firewall&#x27;s web filter and it is blocked. TikTok seems to be a different sort of animal. I am using a Fortigate firewall. I have added several tiktok domains to the web filter, and I&#x27;ve tried web rating overrides with no luck.
 Does anyone have any experience with this? Thank You

                              <span>When I started IT years ago around 2000 I was always eager kept that attitude through allu jobs from an operator to architecture and in management. Around 2015 I started to lose the fire and found myself with the fuck it not my problem attitude. 
 I also noticed no one cares. Work your ass of get paid. Be lazy still get paid the same.
 Right now I&#x27;m supposed to be a senior application administrator, the manager is always doing the &quot; man we are so busy&quot; or &quot;how can we keep up&quot; lines. I played 33 hours of Red Dead Redemption this week while at work. And you know what I don&#x27;t feel one bit of shame about it. They pay me 158k plus bonus to play video games.
 Now don&#x27;t get me wrong if I&#x27;m assigned a task I get it done. I just no longer go out looking for work.
 Moral of the post. Don&#x27;t work when you don&#x27;t need too folks.

                              <span>Hey guys,
 ​
 I&#x27;m hoping someone can help me out with this as Microsoft support is useless *sigh. Several people in our company are having connection issues with the outlook desktop app. The web app works just fine but every time you connect to the desktop app you receive an error &quot;Cannot connect to the exchange server&quot;
 It doesn&#x27;t matter where the person is connected from as it happens at every location. Has anyone ever experienced this?
 I tried all the basic troubleshooting steps. Such as resetting the router, Uninstalling and reinstalling Office 365, updating Office 365, Signing out and signing back in, Disabling Zscaler.
 I&#x27;ve ruled out Zscaler as the problem as I&#x27;ve ran a computer without it for 24 hours and still nothing happened.
 ​
 Thanks for any advice and help.
 UPDATE: With Microsoft support help I was able to restore a few people&#x27;s functionality. We used the restore Outlook cmd.
 Run in administrator mode:
 DISM.exe /Online /Cleanup-image /Restorehealth
 sfc /scannow
 I still have a handful who are not able to use the application still even with this.

                              <span>Hi I am having some trouble understanding what the difference between Allocated Space and Configured Space is.
 I read the manual that reads below. In our environment our Configured Space is larger than the Allocated Space. I am not sure how this is possible. I am definitely missing something about how storage works. Any ideas? Thanks!
 Configured Space—Total amount of space available on all of the configured volumes in the Storage Center.
 Allocated Space—Amount of disk space allocated on the disks for volumes plus RAID overhead. (Not used in Storage Center versions 7.1 or 7.2).

                              <span>Hello Reddit
 So - I want to use Endpoint Manager (Intune whatever) but I am certain that it requires a Business Premium or E3 license at least.
 This is expensive and perhaps not the best solution for some customers - small to medium business size.
 To add more complexity in would be cool to use this in a multi tenant environment.
 So my question - is there a way to manage win 10 and mobile devices without either BP or E3? within Microsoft 365 administration - with licenses such as Business standard or exchange online?
 Or is it a matter of swallowing the Microsoft license pricing and get it over with?

                              <span>What has been your experience when enabling DKIM checking? 
 I already had DMARC checking enabled in Barracuda email protection which will check DKIM and SPF if there is a DMARC record. If there is no DMARC record, then nothing is checked. I thought it would be good to add DKIM so that DKIM is independently checked only if the sending domain does not have a DMARC record.
 DKIM has only been enabled for 48 hours and I have already had to whitelist 10 different domains. I could see this reaching over 100 in a couple weeks. We work with a lot of small companies and I am guessing that&#x27;s why they have no DMARC or DKIM records. Starting to wonder if having this enabled is worth it.

                              <span>Our breach insurance requires we put all our server behind MFA. At the moment we all use a domain admin account to log into the servers to work with them. So generally that&#x27;s the profile that everything is saved under. So I ask to anyone who went MFA did you have to change over to using your personal accounts to log into server as that&#x27;s what has the MFA? Or did you stick to a server account for server login and place that account behind MFA?

                              <span>Happy Friday everyone.
 I have a scenario, and I&#x27;m hoping someone can provide some insight. We are migrating an on premise Exchange 2016 server to exchange online, using CodeTwo Exchange Migration. I am assuming since this isn&#x27;t hybrid, we can gracefully uninstall Exchange server and remove it from Active Directory.
 However the catch is that we will be setting up Azure AD sync soon after. This primarily to setup MFA on the RD Gateway, using the NPS extension. I&#x27;ve set this up before successfully with an existing tenant, matching local AD UPNs to exchange online mailboxes. In that scenario though, a local exchange server never existed.
 Long story long, can I perform the exchange cutover using 3rd party tools, decommission the exchange server; then setup Azure AD connect? Could there be issues with managing the mailboxes in exchange online once Azure AD sync is setup, even though we were not in a true hybrid Scenario?
 Please let me know what you all think, and if I need to clarify any details. Thanks.

 I am trying to view all the emails sent by someone in my organization to an external address. Message trace is not an option since it can only go 90 days back. Management needs a report that shows all emails and not 90 days back.
 I tried using eDiscovery but it pulls nothing every time. It does not pull any email whatsoever. Is there a PowerShell script that I could use for this? Does anyone know a better approach for this?
 Edit -- Content Search is not working for me. Not sure what I am doing wrong but it shows no results. 
 Content Search Conditions:
 Search - mailbox: [email@mydomain.com](mailto:email@mydomain.com)
 To: externaldomain.com
 I also tried using keyword -- participants:externaldomain.com.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hello,
 While setting up a new workstation, which is meant to be outside company&#x27;s domain, I ran the script Baseline-LocalInstall -Win11NonDomainJoined. After the script was done, I cannot turn the Remote Desktop Protocol function. The slider stays on &#x27;off&#x27;, no matter what I do (tried editing GPO as well as adding a couple of REG_DWORD&#x27;s, and for the life of mine I cannot figure out what else to do. Has anyone, by any chance, encountered similiar issues? What I&#x27;ve noticed is that the RDP has turned of automatically while the following line was being returned in PowerShell:
 Running LGPO.exe /v /g ..\GPOs\{2C3C079A-D4FB-47BD-BF32-DE883E9AF6C4} Applying GPO &quot;MSFT Windows 11 - Domain Security&quot;... Running LGPO.exe /v /g ..\GPOs\{091755B0-6C83-48E7-A77A-E89D0C2EAF27} Applying GPO &quot;MSFT Windows 11 - User&quot;...

Running LGPO.exe /v /s ConfigFiles\DeltaForNonDomainJoined.inf /t ConfigFiles\DeltaForNonDomainJoined.txt 
 Any help would be appreciated!

                              <span>After 6 months in a much larger MSP. I&#x27;ve come to realize my mistake. I thought $$ was more important than I expected. Now after working 10-12 hour days 5-6 days a week I&#x27;ve had enough. Started applying for jobs again. Found one that is a 10k pay cut however. It&#x27;s only part time hours(25-30), no on call. I can&#x27;t wait to have my life back. Live and learn I suppose.
 TLDR: took a higher pay job, work/life balance is way out of whack. Found a job for slightly less pay to get my time back

                              <span>Hello, 
 I have 3 domains in one azure tenant.
 spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com
 spiderman.com
 batman.com 
 I have created 50 users with UPN spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com. 
 99% of all those users will have [user@spiderman.com](mailto:user@spiderman.com) when we go live.
 Some of them will have same &#x27;accountname&#x27; but other domain. 
 e.g
  
UserA is created as [fanta@spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:fanta@spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com)
 With E5 license assigned. When we go live, i&#x27;ll change the users UPN to [fanta@spiderman.com](mailto:fanta@spiderman.com) 
 
UserB is created as fanta@batman.com
 With E5 license assigned. 
 
 Since my fallback-domain is spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com and other possible attributes in the tenant might be connected to this domain. Can my practice cause any problems? 
 Reason why I am worried is 
 UserA
 [fanta@spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:fanta@spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com) will obviously have [fanta@spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:fanta@spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com) as an SMTP adress in exchange. This account have &quot;Identies&quot; in Azure AD s[pidermancc.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:fanta@spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com). 
 ​
 UserB
 [fanta@batman.com](mailto:fanta@batman.com) will only have [fanta@batman.com](mailto:fanta@batman.com) as SIP and SMTP adress in exchange.
 But this account also have &quot;s[pidermancc.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:fanta@spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com).&quot; as identities in Azure AD. 
 E.g &quot;Identities&quot; in Azure AD. Even If I create the user as [fanta@](mailto:fanta@spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com)batman.com the Identities in Azure AD is spidermancc.onmicrosoft.com - I believe this will change if I change the fall-back domain or the primary domain (?) 
 Is my practice a problem? Is there any best-practices or workarounds by not creating an other tenant with batman.com as domain (?)

 I dont have allot of info to give here but we got some weird issues going on, I cannot RDP to certain windows servers even though im a domain admin all the sudden, we also have a RDS server with some remote apps installed and end users cant rdp (rds) to those as well. I dont see any errors in the event log regarding this.. Its kinda strange.. Anyone run into anything like that?

                              <span>Lying about this stuff doesn&#x27;t come naturally to me (I&#x27;m not a BOFH). I&#x27;m conscious that any excuse will be exposed if management decides to tell the truth later which would mean the same lie won&#x27;t work twice.
 I figure this must be a fairly common scenario but it&#x27;s something I&#x27;ve rarely if ever encountered. We&#x27;re a small business so I can&#x27;t really hide behind buerocratic processes. And I expect to be seeing these people in person later due to other work making it even harder to duck the question.
 (I don&#x27;t know or need to know the reason why. I don&#x27;t think the user is being immediately sacked; I&#x27;ve been told their PC and other logins can stay active.)

 I&#x27;m looking for a webscript which would help in migrating a website / database / mail from one server to another. This tool should be installed on a 3rd server such that it can be re-used. Preferably something which has configuration options to define the source and destination server (ftp / ftp over ssl / sftp / scp / rsync), and for mail something like the following:
 https://imapsync.lamiral.info/X/
 Does such a tool exist?

 Environment is company owned and BYOD iphones. Exchange online, Intune (M365 E3).
 I know you can export contacts to phone with outlook, but it doesn&#x27;t sync the other direction.
 Why is this so hard?

                              <span>Hi, our internal call system is connected to the agenda of outlook and it means you&#x27;re unavailable when you are in a meeting (Busy/Out of Office), for the sales people this annoying so what you can do is create a new form with tentative as standard so new appointments always have it as default.
 Can you push a outlook form with a GPO so it is automatic?

                              <span>this might seem like a dumb question to many of you but I&#x27;m having trouble understanding when should I target devices and when should I target users, currently in the environments that I manage I just targets users since we don&#x27;t any need for kiosk mode or similar and we only have laptops that we give to each user 
 hope someone can share with me whatever testing/logic you applied in your environments

                              <span>Hi, our company is visiting a hotel in up Scotland for a big presentation in a conference room. 50+ people. They have a projector and I will be taking a laptop with all the presentations on there. If anything goes wrong &#x27;technically&#x27;, all eyes will be on me. I will have a spare laptop, copies of the presentations on both laptops and on a USB, spare HDMI cables. All presentations will be tested in advance. How else could I prepare? And for everyone&#x27;s amusement, please feel free to share your presentation disaster stories! Thanks!

 ​
 On our Windows 10 &amp; 11 we use the following registry setting to hide the networking icon within file explorer:
 ​
 GPO:
 ​
 Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE Key Path: SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies\NonEnum Value name: {F02C1A0D-BE21-4350-88B0-7367FC96EF3C} Value type: REG_DWORD Value Data (hex): 00000001 
 ​
 However, but its not working.

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Anyone else encountered an issue with getting failed login attempts when connecting to a Hyper-V VM via FCM or Hyper-V and sometimes intermittently via SCVMM? 
 The issue I&#x27;m currently seeing is when I connect to a VM from a management server which doubles up as a DC I&#x27;m getting a failed login attempt from the Hyper-V console and even after putting the right credentials in, it is still failing. It is not doing this entirely for all VMs. If I try from another management server (another DC) It is allowing logins just fine and can see the VM console to enter the password for the VM. I can login just fine to the Hyper-V hosts with the same account and can migrate VMs etc.

                              <span>Hi all,
 After the Rackspace ransomware incident in December, I migrated my email to Microsoft 365 because I didn&#x27;t really have the time to explore other options. Now that I have, I want to free myself from both Rackspace and Microsoft altogether.
 I have numerous reasons for not wanting to stay with Microsoft which I won&#x27;t get into as it&#x27;s not really relevant. My issue is more of a technical one.
 So, I&#x27;m planning to migrate to a regular IMAP provider and have been able to enable IMAP for my M365 account, but with MS disabling basic auth I can&#x27;t use imapsync to migrate the email due to it having issues with OAuth.
 I&#x27;m not above setting up a local IMAP server and converting my PST file(s) to Maildir if that&#x27;s what it takes, but I&#x27;d rather find something that will just copy everything across and not require any user intervention.
 So I guess my question is whether anyone knows of something that will allow me to do this.
 Powershell script, bash script, installable applications, anything that works and which is NOT &quot;Copy everything across manually&quot;.
 I run Linux at home and Windows at work, and I&#x27;m ideally looking for something fully functional and free. I&#x27;m not against paying for software, it just feels like a waste paying for a license for a program I will use once, as this will be a one-time thing.

                              <span>I was using my laptop in my college. And my data got finished, so i was trying to connect to an open wifi. And as soon as I connected to the network, my Kaspersky showed notifications of blocked malicious download for 7 to 10 times. I got scared. When I went to research what&#x27;s it. I came to the Kaspersky report that it was:-
 Application name: svchost.exe
 Application path: c:/windows/system32
 Component: web antivirus
 Result description: blocked
 Type: malicious link
 Name: http://wpad.domain.name/wpad.dat
 Precision: exactly
 Threat level: High
 Object type: webpage
 Object name: wpad.dat
 Object path: http://wpad.domain.name
 Reason: databases
 Database release date: 20-1-2023 01:44:00
 Please clarify what it is. Am i being hacked? Is it a virus download? Am I safe? All of the notifications says the same i checked it. I haven&#x27;t connected the laptop to the internet

                              <span>Hi. I received an email which has some attachments destroyed. I assume that some SMTP gateway destroyed that during spam or antivirus scanning. The message was completely recompiled (I know the sending tool and the original MIME encoding was completely different). I want to help the sender to identify the bad device and wonder if it is possible to identify the vendor of the gateway by the used MIME boundary?
 This are the used boundaries:
 boundary&#x3D;&quot;----&#x3D;_NextPart_000_7D6C_01D92C30.D0148B80&quot;
 boundary&#x3D;&quot;----&#x3D;_NextPart_001_7D6D_01D92C30.D014B290&quot;
 Sadly, the header does not give me any hint about the gateway because I do not see anything in the received fields except the last outgoing IP. This device seems to also remove anything previous.
 Due to a google search, I think it may be a Checkpoint firewall, but is there some experience about such headers?

                              <span>For those of you, who use Yubikey in Smart Card mode:
  
Is there a way to force users to change PIN in a while?
 Do you block USB ports to only allow Yubikeys in PIV mode and not devices in storage mode?
 I would allow users to do self-enrollment like here:
 https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015654500-Setting-up-Windows-Server-for-YubiKey-PIV-Authentication#User-Self-Enrollment
 But in case they loose the key, will they be able to self-roll certs to a new key? Now there are two keys per user and one lost. Is only solution to not allow self-enrollment?

                              <span>We had a spammer that was sending a massive amounts of spam mails. One of the students had their PC compromised.
 We first noticed we are getting on Blacklists
 After some time, we found who the spammer was, and we removed their mailbox. That was the reason why we got on all the blacklists, like BARACUDA, SORBS.
 Now SORBS and BARACUDA delisted us immediately after providing the reason.
 But UCEPROTECTL3 doesn&#x27;t want to remove us, it&#x27;s been more than 10 days since last spam message, and they are not doing anything.We also can&#x27;t send any message to gmail, it just says Our system has detected that this message is likely unsolicited mail. To reduce the amount of spam sent to Gmail, this message has been blocked.
 What to do now?
 Could UCEPROTECTL3 be the reason we can&#x27;t send any mails to gmail and yahoo?

 Context: our company was in bad shape financially, everyone knew it and bad news kept on piling up. The company had some visibility on national level, so there had been even some articles in the press about the bad situation. There was a sort of exec committee made up of the 5 or 6 top department managers of the company, and they had met and apparently discussed rumors of a big layoff plan that seemed unavoidable. A couple of days later, there was an article in the press about this and the article was very specific about some details. Our legal team (I guess) contacted the journalist and demanded that …</span>

 sometimes some servers doesn&#x27;t properly update with wsus and sccm and then I have to update manual with the update package from ms update catalogue.
 For example the latest update on the server is update from october, do I have to patch the november, december and then the january patch or can I skip all these months and go direct to the update package from january? Does the latest update package include all security and functions patches from the last update packages?

                              <span>Without making this question too complicated: I&#x27;m wondering if there are any benefits to PVLANs beyond them simply being easier to configure than tons of different VLANs. Obviously in the classic hotel room example, manually configuring hundreds of different VLANs would be a bit more tedious than throwing switchports into PVLANs, but is that it? Is there really any other valid purpose to PVLANs? The experts all seem to suggest that this is tied to layer 3 subnets but it&#x27;s not like you can&#x27;t have devices in different VLANs part of the same subnet as it is. As far as I&#x27;m aware, the only real purpose of 1:1 VLAN:subnet relationships is for better organization/consistency across L2 and L3. 
 EDIT: Got my answer here. Thanks so much for helping me understand this all.

                              <span>Hi there!
 I&#x27;m trying to set up an old IP cam that used to connect seamlessly to an app, until the manufacturer (foscam?) decided to discontinue the ddns.
 The manufacturer recommends using p2p to connect using the provided UID, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to work at all, so my other option should be port forwarding or, of course, a VPN. However, my isp has me under a double NAT and doesn&#x27;t allow me full network or router management. The only thing they can provide me is port forwarding the required port of the cam&#x27;s ip.
 I know port forwarding an IP camera, specially an old model is a security concern, but since this is for eventual surveillance during specific hours or days and the camera would otherwise be off, how much of a risk could this pose? Is there any way to keep using this camera?
 Thanks for any help or suggestions!

                              <span>We noticed on this new Dell Mx Blade architecture, that it supported two ways of partitioning a NIC. One was SR+IOV, the other was NPAR. When you are in the BIOS, you can select one of the following options:
  
None
 NPar
 SR_IOV
 NPar+SR_IOV
  
We are having a devil of a time understanding the true differences (and advantages/disadvantages) between SR_IOV and NPAR (different standards, but they accomplish roughly the same thing? why?).
 Even more confusing, is the &quot;NPar+SR_IOV&quot; option. Why would someone select both, versus one or the other? Does anyone understand this technology, the Use Cases, and why one would choose one versus another?

                              <span>Work for a mid size manufacturing company. In looking at their networking telecommunication invoices, it appears like a mess.

 Airespring, AT&amp;T, CenturyLink, Frontier, Global Capacity, Level 3, Metcom, Rogers, Spectrum, TWC, Verizon. 
 Every month spending around 60K. 
 For the landlines, trying to switch to teams and reduce as many lines. 
 Any suggestion how to approach this and negotiate pricing or any vendor recommendation who can look into what we are paying and review this.

 Appreciate any pointers feedback on this.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to come up with ideas to solve a bandwidth issue at work. Our ISP only provides 25Down/5Up network connections and we have well over a hundred users. We currently have multiple connections from our ISP located at different places in our building.
 I was thinking about putting all the gateways in one place, connecting them to a single switch, and load balance all the traffic over those gateways. This way all my users are on the same network internally and they aren&#x27;t handicapped by the limitation of just 1 uplink connection.
 Can I do this? if so, any recommendations on hardware?
 If not, can you recommend another way to add up 10 or so connections to behave like 1 up link?

                              <span>I know it&#x27;s often repeated how leased line is superior because of being dedicated as compared to broadband which is a shared medium.
 Lately I&#x27;ve been seeing in few countries, there&#x27;s an option to opt for multi gig broadband which is possible due to fiber getting widely adopted.
 The biggest case for leased line till now was it can&#x27;t go beyond 1gbps as Gpon is limited to 2Gbps. But the Xgspon is has started to be used, nokia has 25G pon. Huawei has its own version of 50G pon plus 100G pon has passed the standardization.
 So the question is does it really matter to use leased line if the same can be delivered effectively with 10,25,50 or 100G pon. I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s capacity will too rise in future.
 I kinda find it ridiculous that businesses pay huge amount for leased line when such solution are available. Now obviously not every ISP uses these latest version. But I wanna know am I missing something?

                              <span>I am doing some testing with some Cisco AP&#x27;s and switches (list of supported devices here) that can be tied to the Cisco Business Dashboard which is a controller that you can host yourself on Ubuntu 20.04 for managing up to 25 devices for free. So far my experience with it has been poor as I have found their documentation for getting the devices setup to be very lacking and I would not consider this a &quot;Simple device setup&quot; as their marketing says. 
 I talked to a few of my other networking friends who are Cisco fans but did not like it either and finding any other reviews has been helpful. Before I write this off as a half baked product idea from Cisco I thought I would ask if anyone here had a different perspective on it, if you had it running with any larger deployments, if you found their setup to be as confusing as i do.
 Thanks.

Maybe I am mixing things up. 
 (EP&#x3D;endpoint) 
 So, there can be 4 different scenarios of this packet flow: 
 endpoint X and endpoint Y are both connected to same leaf: 
 -&gt; Flow: 1.a: EPX has pkt to send to EPY. Since its on same VLAN, EPX would send ARP query with dst MAC as FF:FF... to leafA (leafA because this is the outgoing interface connected on that VLAN). leafA gets that packet, finds dst MAC is broadcast MAC, and since pkt is a VLAN tagged pkt, sends broadcast on that VLAN to all EPs. EPY responds, leafA unicasts reply back to EPA and stor…</span>

 I might be digging too deep into this, however I need to ensure there are no compatibility issues, or if I should just be purchasing 10GbE SFP+ adapter cards on these new servers.

 Here is the priority order:
  
Uptime (stopping myself from building one...)
 Throughput (have to say goodbye to meraki)
 Cost (again with ~8k yearly renewal.. bye meraki)
 IPS/malware download prevention/etc
 Monitoring (hopefully something that can pop into grafana)

                              <span>Apologies if this has been answered / explained before. I just got curious and couldn&#x27;t find the answer. Is there a specific reason why Cisco Firewalls only allow /24 DHCP pool per interface?

                              <span>This might sound a dumb question but I need you to confirm this to me..
 ​
 We have active/active tunnels to a VNET in Azure, which belong to the same zone. We do not have ECMP enabled hence our routing always goes through tunnel 1.
 The app which runs in this has issue every time there is an azure maintenance and traffic is switched to tunnel 2.
 I read in the knowledge base that a session is defined like this:
  
On a Palo Alto Networks firewall, a session is defined by two uni-directional flows each uniquely identified by a 6-tuple key: source-address, destination-address, source-port, destination-port, protocol, and security-zone.
  
When you enter the below on the firewall
 show session id 1234567 
 You get an output confirming the above, but also mentioning the ingress/egress interface.
 ​
 My question is:
 Are sessions also binded to the ingress/egress interface? Will a non-SYN TCP packet be forwarded to tunnel 2 during the Azure maintenance, or would the client need to create a new session?
 ​
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hi all,
 maybe someone has encountered a similar behavior as we ... 
 We had the issue that during a bios update on the server , the Nexus 5k disconnected the FEX were the server was connected.
 The issue happened on different 5k versions with different Server hardware - only common piece is a broadcom card.
 According to Cisco TAC the issue is that the server NIC is sending massive amount of Pause frames during the bios update which is causing the 5k to disconnect the FEX to save the Nexus CPU from overloading ..
 ​
 This sounds just strange to me - why should the NIC send pause frames ... we did the BIOS update on about 400 servers and it happened only on 2 machins.
 ​
 The update killed both FEX where the server was connected - so it killed all servers which were connected to both FEXs.
 ​
 Just wanted to know if someone has seen something similar

 On Unimus official site I found that they support FS switches:
  
 Fiberstore (FS.com) switches 
 Fiberstore (FS.com) Campus switches 
  
Does anyone had same problem?

 Testing 8021x wired auth with Clearpass NAC
 One thing I&#x27;ve encountered is if I disconnect a network cable and reconnect it straight after, the authentication on a windows client fails. I need to leave it about 30 seconds or so and then try again.
 I don&#x27;t see anything on the NAC suggesting it is even making a request, so I&#x27;ve a feeling there&#x27;s maybe a timeout or cooldown on the switch for reauth? Would that make any sense?

 I have two Linux servers in Azure. The first is a database server and the source for an outbound connection to the remote server. The second server is a StrongSWAN VPN server that we route to in order to get to the customer. Because of the customer’s VPN requirement, I have setup a routing rule on the database server that our Maximum Segment Size (MSS) is 1360:
  ip route add  via  dev eth0 advmss 1360 
 I am attempting to open an SSH connection from this database server to the customer’s server. I can see from a tcpdump on the databas…</span>

                              <span>There are endless debates over the best local tld to use for a domain. After years of using .internal myself, I’ve switched to registering an actual public tld to ensure it’s owned. This post isn’t about that, it’s just context.
 My question: If I use foo.com as my internal domain, what should I point the public (registrar) nameservers to?
 Of course, I have internal resolution working perfectly well already regardless of the public nameservers, since I control internal (local) dns, but I’m interested in what people here consider best practice for the public nameserver value. Should I point it to my internal (private) IP to ensure any stray queries from my networks are resolved? Should I point it to an empty zone in a public nameserver?

                              <span>I was using my laptop in my college. And my data got finished, so i was trying to connect to an open wifi. And as soon as I connected to the network, my Kaspersky showed notifications of blocked malicious download for 7 to 10 times. I got scared. When I went to research what&#x27;s it. I came to the Kaspersky report that it was:-
 Application name: svchost.exe
 Application path: c:/windows/system32
 Component: web antivirus
 Result description: blocked
 Type: malicious link
 Name: http://wpad.domain.name/wpad.dat
 Precision: exactly
 Threat level: High
 Object type: webpage
 Object name: wpad.dat
 Object path: http://wpad.domain.name
 Reason: databases
 Database release date: 20-1-2023 01:44:00
 Please clarify what it is. Am i being hacked? Is it a virus download? Am I safe? All of the notifications says the same i checked it. I came across a post years back. So i posted it here so if you could help me.
 Edit: I haven&#x27;t connected the laptop to the internet

                              <span>Hey all,
 Network Architect here - I finally deployed some PA firewalls (basic ACLs before) to separate SCADA and Enterprise, which currently shares the same hardware but on different vlans. 
 Right after finishing this, I&#x27;ve been told they want IT out of the network itself and want to manage it with some Rockwell branded Cisco switches. My team would be in charge of the firewall and that&#x27;s it. This... Seems like a bad idea to me? They don&#x27;t have network experience nor Cisco experience and it&#x27;s about 40-45 switches they&#x27;d take over. 
 For folks with SCADA or PLCs in your environment, do you manage those networks? Do the plant operators? I&#x27;m looking to see what the SOP for this kinda thing is. I&#x27;ve no qualm if they want to use these switches but I feel like you&#x27;d want the people who know how to manage and monitor them to... do that for you?@

                              <span>Hello;
 I&#x27;m looking for a simple ethernet port tester, something that will simply show if the port is connected to a switch and determine 10base-t or 100base-t (not necessary to tell if gigabit, but would be nice) or if the port is being used by an analogue phone or PBX... 
 I&#x27;m currently using a Test-um TP-100... it&#x27;s small and I carry it around with me in my laptop bag. Much quicker to simply &#x27;whip&#x27; it out and test the network jack to see if it is connected, than booting up the laptop and seeing if there are network lights. It&#x27;s really quick to check all the ports in a 48 port patch panel to see if there is anything plugged in at the other end.... 
 I want to purchase a second unit... because it seems that the TP-100 is no longer available. What is everyone here using?

                              <span>Hi Friends,
 So I’m working on untangling a bunch of shadow IT at an org and I’m hoping you guys can give me some insight on how you would handle announcing this to leadership, execs, and dev team that think they need local admin rights and Global admin rights to 365?
 What type of solutions are out there that might help some of the pushback I receive or justification questions I might want to ask?
 Thank you!

                              <span>I recently graduated from an ITM bachelors program, and I recently started at a company, with about 300 employees(100 or so office staff &amp; 200 or so purely field/WFH), as an IT Helpdesk Specialist. They had 1 other IT employee who they said was their admin and had been employed for about 4 years, but I never met him during the interview process. In the time he&#x27;s been their admin, the company has gone through 4 other IT employees who usually stayed anywhere between 3-4 months. When I asked about this, they said it was because they all got better, and more specialized IT jobs in their preferred areas of IT.
 My first day, before I even met him, I was pulled aside and explicitly told by the VP that I do not report to the current admin. I was then brought to the admin&#x27;s office and he started g…</span>

                              <span>This is technically my first time posting here and just want to get your guys feedback. I’ve been with this same company for 12yrs and I have seen a lot of changes over the years of my employment there. When I first joined it was a non-public company, my previous boss was great, I had time to research on certain projects, put in extra time (not because I had to but I wanted to). Within the years of employment, I’ve seen the company become Public, I’ve been promoted several times, made a name for myself (all the execs know me) and now a manager leading two different teams. However, I feel that it has become more stressful. For me personally I’ve also had things change over the years, I got married back in 2020 to my best friend and we now have a newborn (Baby Girl). I just returned back to work last week and I’m currently struggling on getting back into the groove of things. I’m use to sometimes staying late just to catch up on some work or go in on the weekends to help with maintenance that I can’t necessarily do during the week. You might be asking, why am I doing this…? Because of staffing issues. Yes, I lead two teams but they are a small team and most of them have just started within last year. At this moment, I feel like I’m slowing down and I cannot possibly stay late anymore nor work on the weekends as I use to. My fear is loosing my job due to performance as there are a lot of projects but I feel like staffing is an issue. The one thing I’ve told my employees repeatedly is that Family comes first, no matter what.
 Just thought I’d share on here to get your guy’s thoughts.

                              <span>There&#x27;s a web app managed by a 3rd Party that has MFA on their roadmap 3 years away. I&#x27;d like to have an interim solution. Since we can use IP restriction, does anyone know of a solution using Azure or another 3rd Party portal-like platform?
 Extra info - can&#x27;t restrict to only a few IPs (I.e. office locations) as a lot of clients use the web app.
 I&#x27;ll edit this with answers to any questions.

However, we are not able to set the scrolling to anything but “natural scrolling” on the guest user. Because we use regular wired mice, this means zooming in and out on tinkercad is inverted. I have an AppleScript that works on my intel MacBook running Monterey, but it won’t work on the m1 running Ventura because they changed up the settings. Can someone tell me what I need to replace on the “current pane” line?
 on run tell application &quot;System Settings&quot; set current pane to pane &quot;com.apple.preference.mouse&quot; activate end tell tell application &quot;System Events&quot; to tell process &quot;System Preferences&quot; set cbValue to value of (click checkbox 1 of window 1) end tell tell application &quot;System Settings&quot; to quit end run

                              <span>Our company uses SaaS software since we&#x27;re primarily remote work, before I joined there wasn&#x27;t any process in place to check to see if the vendors we utilized actually protected our data. Now part of our software vendor vetting/onboarding practice involves getting either a copy of a SOC2/ISO27001 audit report or having them fill out a vendor security questionnaire so we can get a good idea on their data handling processes. I&#x27;m going through our backlog of vendors and requesting these of them so I know where we stand risk wise.
 Every vendor I&#x27;ve reached out to has supplied a SOC2 Type 2 or ISO audit report after throwing an NDA my way. However in a first, I&#x27;ve gotten this email back from a certain collaborative tool vendor.
  
Hey /u/by_frozenriver, Thank you for reaching out and addressing your request!
 SOC 2 report can only be shared under NDA (which is signed with Enterprise customers), so please let us know if you’d like to evaluate it for your company, and we will gladly pass your request to our Sales team.
 We&#x27;re glad to inform you that the option to download a SOC 3 report is available on our website. We&#x27;d like to point out that diagrams in SOC 3 report are publicly available as a preview, the actual files in high resolution fall under the Security review that we conduct for Enterprise customers only. We deeply apologize for the inconvenience caused here, but as per our internal Security Policy it is not possible to share the docs in question with non-Enterprise customers and that is not something the Support team is allowed to share at all as we do not conduct Security reviews.
  
I&#x27;ve reached out to them to see if they&#x27;d fill our security questionnaire in that case. But still, what a weird practice. Pay for the product (on it&#x27;s highest tier) and then we&#x27;ll show you that it&#x27;s safe?
 Definitely going to be looking into alternatives before this annual commitment is up.

                              <span>I just got promoted from NOC Tier I Technician to Associate Network Engineer after one year at this MSP (It wasn&#x27;t easy, I studied and worked my butt off for this). This is my first job in the industry after graduating technical college for IT, and it seems like my career is taking off quick. I should be fully transitioned into the Engineering team by February 20th. What can I expect in my new life as a Network Engineer? Also, how does being a Network Engineer for an MSP look on a resume? Would it have any more weight than if I was just an Engineer at a standard enterprise, or is it about the same? Thank you I&#x27;m advance!

 Need to uninstall and reinstall a VOIP system.
 Engineering has the filepath locked down by their admin account.
 Have to drive into the office (the nerve!).
 Get there, engineers can&#x27;t fix it. 
 Boss - &quot;Well Pirate, guess you&#x27;ll have to work from the office.&quot;
 Me - &quot;Why? I can just go home and use my personal laptop that I&#x27;ve been using up until now.&quot;
 Boss - &quot;Well how are you going to take phone calls!?!&quot; *disgusted look on their face*
 Me, equally disgusted - &quot;The same way I have been for the last 8 months... log into the software and answer the call if it comes through.&quot;

 How common is it for you? The people who are making decisions for you - people who claim they are responsible for you, have no idea what they are talking about. They&#x27;re unqualified. Inexperienced. Uneducated. 
 ​
 Their idea of &quot;Leadership&quot; is &quot;Initiative&quot;.
 &quot;Why don&#x27;t we have this process documented? Get it documented now.... &quot; That&#x27;s *initiative*.
 &quot;How long have we been operating without documentation? Is there a good spot we can put it so that we can all access the docs?&quot; That&#x27;s leadership.

                              <span>I&#x27;m especially interested in feedback from this crowd since I imagine many of you have pushed out large scale distributions of thunderbolt docks - possibly varying models and brands.
 I dipped my toe into the waters of thunderbolt starting 4-5 years ago with the Dell WD19. I only got around 10 of them in place, but every single one of them would periodically stop recognizing that they had an ethernet connection until the user unplugged and replugged the dock and then rebooted their laptop.
 Then around 3 years ago I rolled out about 50 Lenovo Thunderbolt 3 Gen 2 docks with matching X1 Carbon laptops. It seemed like around 50% of those docks ALSO had similar issues, dropping ethernet occasionally, as well as USB devices no longer being recognized, and HDMI outputs dropping their signal. Again, easily resolved with a reboot of the laptop and maybe a power cycle of the dock... but frustrating my users. Since then the reliability rate seems to be much improved... about 90% of those docks are fully reliable now running on Lenovo&#x27;s latest 3.1.81 firmware plus Intel&#x27;s latest thunderbolt drivers/firmware. Though oddly, the remaining 10% are unreliable despite all of those same updates.
 And so I&#x27;ve moved on to replacing those remaining 10%, and have mostly been replacing them with the Caldigit TS4... which is obscenely expensive. But (knock on wood) so far with a limited roll out, I&#x27;ve yet to have any user call me about an issue once the initial setup and firmware update was done.

 Here’s the box
 Also, all of the low voltage boxes are closed back and I didn’t get to see the conduit to them before drywall went in. I can’t confirm yet if that’s the cable in the wall because painters are painting. 
 Assuming it is and we didn’t get billed incorrectly. CCA or ok? Make a stink or let it go? I’ve never heard of this brand before.

                              <span>I work for an engineering company that is testing some cellular modems. These modems need to hit internal systems for testing. The IPs of the cellular modems change frequently - within restarts or days - so having a trusted IP list in the access list won&#x27;t work. Most of the services being hit from the NAT rule require some sort of authentication. However, this is for test engineers who have no reason to consider security. Along with that, they may be testing on an OS or services that have known vulnerabilities. 
 I&#x27;ve been contemplating this for a few days and the only thing I can think of is to put the test VMs on a small private VLAN so their at least contained. On top of that, I figure I may as well add a list of trusted IPs based on the cellular network they are using to at least be somewhat explicit on the access list. However, with my ignorance of how their systems work, there is still the possibility of a bad actor exploiting some vulnerability and possibly getting some sort of foothold and/or company IP. This would be a very targeted attack, but I have to consider the possibility.
 Does anyone have any experience with supporting something like this or have a better idea on how to enable the engineers to get their jobs done while still keeping the company internal network secure along with any IP on the test systems?
 TL;DR: Engineers need to have cellular modems connect to systems on our internal network. My thought is a basic NAT rule allowing any outside connection to that IP:PORT for port forwarding to their systems which I put on a private VLAN.

                              <span>Hi guys, Want to get your feedback on your experiences of building a source of truth at your companies. How do you leverage this? Stopping older/more experienced network engineers from dispersing so much information using excel sheets, and other tools and converging to a unique tool such as the netbox IPAM?
 Also how do you automate insertion and retrieval of information to perform network automation?

                              <span>I’m an intern trying to learn the basics of IT. My manager has taught me the basics of Active Directory and set me up with a project to get me started.
 Right now they use Cisco access points whose authentication is done using the user information in Active Directory. It uses LDAP to do this. The company wants to replace the Cisco access points with the newer Netgear ones, but they still want it to use LDAP to direct authentication. I’ve looked at the user manuals for the new line of products at Netgear that they have listed right now and they seem to only be able to do authentication through the cloud, or by setting it up with a RADIUS server. 
 Are the newer products just not compatible with LDAP, or am I missing something? I’ve seen that the older models could connect to LDAP via the WC7520 or WC7609 controller but I don’t know if that’s still the case with the new access points. I’ve contacted a representative at Netgear but they haven’t got back with me.
 Am I at a dead end?

Can someone help me how to fix this? from my search on google it shows that I need to do these command Switch: dir flash: Switch: more flash:packages.conf Switch: boot flash:packages.con
 I am sorry that I am asking this questions and not trying, but I need to be correct 100% and do the recover very fast once Im allowed physical access to the switches.(around 8h from now)

                              <span>I have been trying to solve this for weeks now: 
 Problem A) NFS connections on my network are barely usable, starting slow then slowing down even more until almost no more traffic passes trough writing/reading from NAS and/or other clients. SMB on the other hand works almost flawlessly though. Problem B) Every traffic from within the network actually doesnt seem to be steady and this behaves in a repeating pattern: it goes from fast to mediocre or even halts every few seconds goes back to full speed and then repeats this behavior after a a few seconds. It’s the same from outside the Network, downloading or uploading from/to the entire network: Client will actually see these interferences aswell.
 After everything I’ve tried I think I narrowed it down to UDP and probably one of the two switches in the network. IPerf between peers and/or NAS or other clients or servers: everything seems fine - except for UDP. Cant establish a connection. Netcat UDP works between all machines except one though : on that specific machine Netcat only works exactly ONCE and then loses (or closes?) the connection immediately. I had good NFS results with a test-share on the NAS when I explicitly disabled UDP + I don’t allow Sync - resulting in up to 1GB/s read and write to the NAS. (SMB is at about 600MB/s) MTU is 1500 everywhere. Turned off Auto-Negotiation and Flow Control everywhere. 
 Any ideas what this could be? In case I observed correctly, I can rule out the following: cables and/or NAS by now.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen alot of hate spewed at Cisco ACI. Personally, I&#x27;ve never was interested in deploying it, as I prefer building networks based on strictly open standards where possible versus a vendor black box solution. That&#x27;s just my design style. 
 I recently came across a thread about ACI while doing some research on the product, in which /u/bmcgahan asks critics of ACI to provide evidence that ACI is dying. 
 Curious about this, I did a simple linked in search on job roles for proprietary technologies like NSX and ACI on Linkedin within the United States. Here are the results:
 ACI NOT Cisco - 4,344 
 Nexus Dashboard - 3 (All from Cisco)
 Arista CVP NOT Arista Networks - 4,145 
 NSX - 1,533 
 Apstra NOT Juniper Networks - 5 (3 of those were from &quot;Juniper Apstra&quot; so it&#x27;s really 2 jobs)
 EVPN - 385
 VXLAN - 743 
 ​
 I feel like you all owe /u/bmcgahan an apology. Cisco is a vendor people love to hate on. Yes their licensing and certain marketing practices are despicable, but there seems to be a market out there for ACI, contrary to what people are saying. 
 After this brief search, I plan to spend some time to learn more about the solution and see where the opportunities might be.
 Edit: Also to be fair and for context, Cisco is a behemoth of a marketing machine with many more feet on the ground when it comes to sales, so naturally their numbers are expected to be bigger. It doesn&#x27;t mean other vendor solutions are better or worse.
