 Configure Microsoft Edge for Windows with policy settings | Microsoft Learn 
 Using a domain admin account, I navigated to \\DC\sysvol\Domain\Policies and I have a lot of items in there but no policydefinitions folder. So I created it along with the EN-US subfolder and then put the ADML file. Then when I go to edit my existing Edge GPO, under administrative templates I now have no settings at all. I reverted the change and it&#x27;s back to what it was, but any idea what I&#x27;m doing wrong? 
 DC&#x27;s are Server 2019 at 2016 AD level.

                              <span>I inherited an EMC VNXe3300 years back and have decided I&#x27;d like to just sell it for parts, as I have no personal need for it. I&#x27;d like to be able to get into the device and securely format all of the data on all of the drives before I sell them.
 The problem is, I cannot get into the interface, and I no longer have access to the EMC/Dell support portal to get the connection utility. I also do not have a miniDBB9 serial cable to connect to the unit, and those cables are ridiculously expensive. Same with SAS USB enclosures.
 Can anyone recommend a cheap way to wipe these drives so I can sell them?
 Thanks!
 EDIT: I don&#x27;t have access to a server to throw these drives in. All i have access to currently is a laptop.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for some general input as I&#x27;m having trouble coming up with reasons for a specific implementation use case.
 Assumptions:
 - All network access requires Machine Auth 802.1x
 - VLANs separate various computer groups
 - Currently we have a VLAN for Corp WiFi and Corp Network (wired computers)
 - Devices at each branch will never surpass a /23 which is what the corp network (wired computers) is configured for
 - Only the devices which also have the access to join Corp Network (wired) can connect to WiFi
 - Max Devices connected to a single AP would be 50 devices
 ​
 Question:
 Is there any reason why a corp devices which connects via 802.1x WiFi should be put on a separate VLAN or would it be advisable just to join them to the same VLAN they&#x27;d join if they were wired?
 ​
 I&#x27;ve seen every business I&#x27;ve worked for separate these networks but while thinking of it I can&#x27;t really decide why this is happening. I guessed it could be something to do with limiting broadcasts but I&#x27;m not sure.

We have security groups to limit access to shared drives, folders and files so this feature is unnecessary and often times problematic. I&#x27;m looking for a way to either disable this feature in the O365 admin portal or via GPO. Poking around in the admin portal hasn&#x27;t turned anything up for me so far. Anyone here have any experience in dealing with this? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Some of my users are on the road a lot, and while the standard built in antennas on Verizon&#x27;s jetpacks are OK for most areas, we&#x27;re having issues in specific spots at certain times of day. Talking to my users, here is what they are experiencing:
  
Still getting 4 bars of service
 Intermittent connection drops (download/upload arrows go away) despite the 4 bars remaining
 Apps that require a constant connection drop and need to be logged into again
 Moving the unit around seems to reacquire download/upload (possibly placebo effect)
  
I&#x27;m looking into solutions to improve their connection. What I&#x27;m not clear on is what the issue is. Doing a bit of research leads me to believe this might be more of an issue of traffic congestion on the tower they are connecting to, or signal interference due to being in a busy area/time of day, than the connection to the tower itself, since they are still getting full bars but receiving poor quality connection.
 Would a signal boosting antenna even help in this case? To me it sounds more like there&#x27;s too much interference and/or the towers are too busy in these locations and times of day.

 I gave this IP statically to a different workstation, and got the same result. Changing the IP of the original workstation to anything else in the subnet, resolves the issue.
 The IP is 10.20.9.1/21. We have Cisco switches.
 I&#x27;m not really sure what else to even check, my Wireshark experience is very limited but I couldn&#x27;t tell anything wrong from there. Only thing I noticed was that two of the SVI gateways had the same mac address? Not sure if that could be the issue. Tried rebooting the switches overnight and that didn&#x27;t fix it either.

                              <span>Hi Guys, 
 We&#x27;re in the process of configuring various parts of Intune and currently use SCCM. All our devices are now enrolled into Into intune and are Hybrid Azure AD Joined.
 I’m trying to get Windows Update notification popups working for all our Windows 10 devices enrolled into Intune, but can’t seem to find the right settings. Currently we have the small restart icon at the bottom right in the task bar but we want to have a pop-up notification so users will be notified in a more obvious way. I think the problem is the following setting in the Advanced Windows Update Settings on all devices. 
 &#x27;Show a notification when your PC requires a restart to finish updating&#x27; 
 This is grayed out and looks to be set to ‘Off’ but I cannot find where this setting is controlled. As these are all Hybrid Joined devices in Co-management I’ve checked through Group Policy and in our Update Rings policy and Windows Update Configuration Policy but I cant find where to enable this setting.
 Does anyone know where this setting is?

 I&#x27;ve been told by our supplier that we can just use M365 Business Standard with Enterprise Mobility + Security E3 for these new users. Is this possible or does this breach Microsoft&#x27;s licensing?
 Edit: think my suspicions were correct the licence limit is collective according to MS...

                              <span>No excuses, here. We continue to miss Microsoft&#x27;s advisory&#x27;s. The latest was us missing the basic authentication deprecation. I&#x27;m embarrassed to say we had ~10% of our user base using basic auth and those users had trouble getting mail yesterday. 
 We&#x27;re a small IT Team, and we&#x27;re working hard to get more resources. However, I still think we can improve with the team we have. I&#x27;m curious how you guys deal with Microsoft messaging and how you proactively get ahead of service interruptions. 
 Accountability isn&#x27;t a problem, we just need to get better and avoid the &quot;hey did you see that email/dashboard message?&quot; That&#x27;s the plan right now, just making sure we take turns being proactive about reading a distro and heading to the health dashboard. 
 What do you guys do? Any fancy technology or process to get advised and take action?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have a client who has just bought himself a new mac book running MacOS 12. When I have gotten the device connected into their file shares running on their on prem Server 2012R2. Whenever he creates a folder on the server it will appear immediately, however if he tries to add or edit a file the changes will take up to 3 minutes to show on the server. The changes can take place almost immediately or after a few minutes (almost like it has some kind of polling rate?)
 Interestingly enough if he tries to change a file somebody else is accessing then it will duplicate and show a &#x27;°&#x27; at the end of the duplicate file.
 I have searched up on the Internet and could see that there were numerous other people having similar problems online specifically with using SMB with this version of MacOS.
 It is worth noting he still has his old mac book that can use the file shares without issue.
 I have tried creating a separate file share and setting the permissions with full access for everyone but still experiencing the same problems.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated. And I can provide any further details if needed.
 Thanks.

 in our company (about 240 meeting rooms) we have a malfunction that it is not possible to book a room directly. 
 You mostly get a tentative message back and the Delegates needs to approve it. As a temporary workaround, all users are now able to book any room.
 All the BookIns worked normal before we updated our Exchange OnPrem-Server to the new SU August and activated Extended Protection. We have a Exchange-Hybrid-Environment. 
 Is anyone else having this issure? Thanks for all answers.

                              <span>I got several cases, where users complain that after Monthly patches being installed they see only one notification from Software Center (Config Manager), it&#x27;s the last one which gives them 15 minutes to a forced reboot. It was not a case for everyone so I started digging and I found that it happens only for people who use the &quot;Focus Assist&quot; feature in Windows 10 (former name &quot;Quiet hours&quot;). So it was obvious that people who have set &quot;Alarms only&quot; won&#x27;t see the reboot notifications, but there is also an option called &quot;Priority only&quot;, where you can select applications that can show notifications - this works well when the user chooses Software Center as a priority app manually, via the GUI.
 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone knows a way to centrally add items to the priority applications list (via GPO or script)?
 The ideal solution would be to:
  
Disable &quot;Alarms only&quot; mode in Focus Assist
 have a possibility to add &quot;Software Center&quot; to the priority list applications

                              <span>Hello,
 i need to configure an Domain Trust with a different site which has its own IT.
 I dont want them to see and configure anything on our site/Domain, thats why i want to implement an External Domain Trust - Non-Transitive with Selective Authentication.
 I set it up in my lab and the only thing i dont understand is, how the other Domain should make use of the Selective Authentication when he doesnt have access to our Domain to select the Users which should be able to authenticate on their resources.
 When i click on the resource domain on ntfs settings, i can change the location to the other Domain but will be prompted for credentials access it.
 How can i manage it so the other Site can configure their Selective Authentication without Domain Credentials from my Domain?
 i cant really find any resource on that.. Just some Videos where they enter the Domain Admin from the Domain, which is a huge security concern for me.
 ​
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hey guys, just seeking advice here.
 My IT team has recently been hired to work at a 1300+ user school and have taken over the whole operation from the old staff. It’s a mix of around 300 BYOD laptops and 1000 supplied Windows laptops.
 The virtual infrastructure is an absolute mess. Blends of Server 2012/2016 VM’s running on an outdated ESXI host.
 We would like to rebuild the VM’s for starters (File/Print, DC1, DC2, NPS) but we’re not sure how to do this to minimise downtime, especially for the BYOD devices.
 The file/print server would be the biggest headache. Next would be cutting over NPS and making sure all of the devices connect up okay.
 How do you even begin to do this to prevent any downtime/issues with a site of this scale?

                              <span>This problem stumps me and my colleagues to no end...
 I&#x27;m hoping someone here can help think this through?
 One of our endusers has the problem where his ethernet connection drops at random intervals, and his Wi-Fi doesn&#x27;t pick up the slack automatically either.
 Here&#x27;s what we tried:
  
New UTP cable
 New docking station
 Connected the cable directly (without docking station)
 Gave him another laptop (issue occurs on 2 laptops now)
 Colleagues tried the same outlets/the same cables, and they can work just fine
  
There are no overarching GPOs on his laptop that cause this.
 One thing we saw was that his domain firewall profile was set to ON while it should be OFF.
 That can&#x27;t be the cause because it was the same for me and I have no issues whatsoever.
 I started checking winevt logs.
 We can pinpoint when the system dropped UTP and the user had to manually connect to Wi-Fi instead:
 A request was made to authenticate to a wireless network.
 Logged: 12/10/2022 11:05:32
 Checked the Security winevt logs; all we saw was the firewall started to check all policies right after the system lost UTP connection. After Googling possible ethernet drop issues I wanted to disable the Energy/Green Energy/Wake on Magic settings in his ethernet adapter to see if that could help, but I can&#x27;t reach his device right now. When he&#x27;s forced to make a manual switch to Wi-Fi we have to reverse connect to his laptop and then run an ipconfig /registerdns before we can continue troubleshooting (most likely due to the fact we are in the middle of a DNS server cutover and those managing the transfer are veggies...).
 Even though, these are all things that shouldn&#x27;t transfer from one laptop to another yet he&#x27;s had the problem on 2 laptops one after the other now.
 Anyone have any clue on what could be causing this issue?

 What tools/techniques do you recommend? I have started to configure GVM on Kali Linux but I’m sure I’ll need more than that. Any experiences would be very welcome

                              <span>I have a Powershell Script that has to run on a scheduled Task to make changes in the AD.
 For the script to run with the right permissions it has to run as a Domain Admin User, but my Domain Admins are not allowed to logon as a Batch Job.
 Should I allow these users to do so?
 My gut tells that that is a bad idea security-wise.

 Thinking of purchase 3 of these for my office. Small business, small setup.
 Was going to go with the HP Elitedesk 800 G9 but this is $600 cheaper.
 How are the Inte NUCs these days?

 Im trying to find a &quot;secure&quot; method of monitoring systems. Ive until now used PRTG and monitor almost entirely over SNMP but have now been told I cannot use SNMPv2 and instead should use v3 (encrypted) which Windows doesnt support. So I need to move product and looking for recommendations. 
 Thanks for reading.

 I’ve got my first interview today for a job where I’ll be working in Systems for the first 12 months, then after that it’ll be primarily a second line / networks / jack of all trades.
 Can anyone offer me any advice? I’m extremely nervous for this :)
 Edit to clarify - this is my first systems related interview, not first interview in general :)

                              <span>Let&#x27;s put aside the fact that throughout the years whenever I faced a problem with CPU usage/high clock I usually faced a 95+ System idle. I faced similar situations on Linux with 100% of the cases ending in htop (linux command) showing me the exact culprit. If not by CPU usage then by CPU wakes.
 Recently my opinion solidified when facing the highest CPU usage I&#x27;ve ever seen on Windows 10 on my laptop. This time I knew the culprit upfront (broken windows search, confirmed by windows reliability history error messages). Windows Search constantly banged the CPU and failed to start, CPU die constantly at 65 deg C. As soon as I fixed Windos Search the CPU die temperature dropped to ~40 deg C! The thing is the entire time neither of the built-in Windows Tools (including the Sysinternals Process Explorer) showed any useful information on the issue. No listed component spiked to more than 3-5% of CPU. Even the memory usage tab in Resource Monitor was better at hinting the culprit than the releavant CPU sections!
 What are your thoughts?

                              <span>Hi all,
 So I&#x27;m in a little bit of a strange discussion with our manager. 
 We need a CMDB and in his opinion Intune should be the CMDB. 
 I do not know the right way for a CMDB, but Intune sounds not right.
 What&#x27;s your opinion?

                              <span>I have a wired workstation that received a DHCP address, it can ping it&#x27;s default gateway and other clients on the same VLAN / Subnet, but cannot get to the internet and cannot ping clients on different VLANs / Subnets.
 I gave this IP statically to a different workstation, and got the same result. Changing the IP of the original workstation to anything else in the subnet, resolves the issue.
 The IP is 10.20.9.1/21. We have Cisco switches.
 I&#x27;m not really sure what else to even check, my Wireshark experience is very limited but I couldn&#x27;t tell anything wrong from there. Only thing I noticed was that two of the SVI gateways had the same mac address? Not sure if that could be the issue. Tried rebooting the switches overnight and that didn&#x27;t fix it either.

                              <span>So, I&#x27;m currently a mid level manager at a small ISP. I recently started looking for new roles and have been offered what seems like a great opportunity.
 The offer is for a network manager role at a more senior level. Its again a small ISP, the network needs a lot of work, a full redesign. Which is exciting. Fully remote, occasional on site meetings. I do have my doubts about work load as I&#x27;d basically be architect and people manager.
 I&#x27;ve accepted and signed the contract.
 But then, yesterday, another role that I&#x27;d been waiting on for a while finally came through. This job would push me harder from a technical perspective, but it comes with no seniority. It also requires 3 days a week in the office and would be far less flexible. Did feel more rapport with the interviewers here. 
 I know only I can make this decision. But any tips on how I make it?! They both have their pros and cons, they both offer good progression for my career one way or another. Can&#x27;t stop thinking about it and still not getting any closer to making a decision!

                              <span>Hello people, we have been using ACI for 3 years. In first year we used it as big l2 switch, later we implemented ospf l3outs and became gateway for some networks and now we implemented PBR to selectively forward traffic to PBR firewall. PBR has become game changer for us as security guys no more has to deal with unnecessary chunk of traffic which makes firewall use resources to the limit. Now while http traffic between two servers is being redirected to firewall, logging traffic between same servers forwarded directly by ACI thanks to specific contracts.
 We are thinking on what else we can implement on ACI to make life easier. How do you use ACI?

                              <span>Hi all, I have a UDM Pro SE which has fiber on WAN1 and a 4G router on WAN2 (a Teltonika RUT241).
 The 4G router does CGNAT, so in order to easily reach the Web GUI for admin purposes I&#x27;ve installed ZeroTier on it and it works well, I can reach it from a LAN device (a mac mini) with ZeroTier installed.
 BUT, Tailscale works so much better for me, so that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m using on all other devices (the 4G router doesn&#x27;t support Tailscale, only ZeroTier).
 My question is if I can somehow bride the LAN to the ZeroTier network using the mac mini as a bridge since it has a network interface for both networks? When I&#x27;m inside my LAN using Tailscale I&#x27;d like to route traffic to the Zerotier network (192.168.192.0/24) via the mac mini.
 I&#x27;m guessing I should setup a static route, pointing traffic going to the destination network 192.168.192.0/24 through the LAN device on 192.168.5.142 (the mac mini), but do I need to do something on the mac mini to make this work?

                              <span>I think I know the answer to this because it&#x27;s glaringly obvious from the error message.. But is it possible to run esp-gcm 256 on an ASR1002? When I try configure it I get an error:
 Transform set NGE-ESP-GCM disabled because esp-gcm 256 is not supported by encryption hardware
 I&#x27;m just posting in the hope that I&#x27;ve missed something and it could maybe be enabled somehow.
 According to this doc, it should be possible.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi,
 Not sure if I’m somehow missing it, but we’re implementing some 80KM dark fiber and we purchased some 100G 80KM QSFP28 modules at 1310nm. However, the loss is a bit high (no link possible) so we wanted to try 1550nm which of course has better attenuation figures, but I can’t locate any QSFP28 100G modules operating at 1550nm??
 Funnily enough though I have found posts in this subreddit with people saying that at 80KM all DWDM modules will be 1550nm - but the exact opposite seems to be true.
 The loss over the link appears to be about 23-26dBm according to our 10G 1650nm 80KM modules, so I’d expect at 1310 it’s closer to 36db of loss.
 I assume the recommendation would be EDFA, but any other suggestions for reliable 100G over this link would be appreciated :)
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi All, 
 I&#x27;m running a small scale test on 802.1x in preparation for a company-wide rollout. We&#x27;re using Cisco catalyst + Microsoft NPS with EAPTLS. On the Windows side of thing everything is working flawlessly but I&#x27;m struggling to get a working MAB policy on NPS for the IP Phones (This model does not support 802.1x) 
 I have seen a few methods of configuring MAB on NPS. One involves setting up a user with username/password as the MAC address. This wont work in my environment as the password is just getting rejected due to complexity requirements. 
 The 2nd method I have seen involves setting up a connection request policy like so : 
 Conditions: 
  
NAS Port Type &#x3D; Ethernet
 Calling Station ID &#x3D; ^00-00-00-00-00$|^11-11-11-11-11$ 
  
Authentication: 
  
&#x27;Accept users without verifying credentials&#x27;
  
The the switchport is configured like so: 
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1 description Access-Port switchport access vlan 101 switchport mode access switchport voice vlan 107 access-session host-mode multi-domain access-session closed access-session port-control auto mab dot1x pae authenticator spanning-tree portfast spanning-tree bpduguard enable service-policy type control subscriber DOT1X2MAB end 
 When connecting the PC works fine, but the IP phone is failing , then the switchport gets err disabled as a result. Is anyone able to advise on where I am going wrong ? Documentation on MAB in NPS seems to be lacking

                              <span>I&#x27;m in a bind to look for an elegant solution to get the following failover solution working and I wondered if anyone here might have any ideas? 
 Diagram as follows : Diagram 
 Simple two site setup with both sites having their own WAN link for internet as well as site to site connectivity. 
 The MPLS wans are setup with eBGP so each Cisco router receives the prefix of the other site via that WAN link for reachability to each other. 
 The LANs of both routers are setup with two subnets and are setup using VRRP. with each router acting as the active VRRP group for each subnet: 
 Site1 : 192.168.1.254
 Site2 : 192.168.0.254
 VRRP is setup so in the event of the WAN going down the other router takes over as VRRP master. 
 This means that as well as resilience that both WAN links are fully utilised instead of all traffic just using the one WAN link. All good! 
 The issue is that due to the point to point interface and VRRP that if the point to point dies so site1 can no longer reach site2 using the point to point that you would want that traffic to go out via the WAN into the MPLS to reach the other site. 
 The problem is of course it won&#x27;t do that due to each of the Cisco routers having LAN&#x27;s which belong to both subnets. So if traffic was going from Site1 to Site2 then as soon as those packets destined for 192.168.0.0/24 hit the Site1 router then it would just not send it out&#x27;s its WAN as it has an interface belonging to that subnet which is up and part of the VRRP group. 
 This is the problem I&#x27;m trying to solve. A solution which I don&#x27;t like is to create a EMM script which will shut down that LAN in the event traffic is no longer using the P2P but I don&#x27;t like how messy that could be. 
 Anyone got any ideas or suggestions then I&#x27;m open to them :) 
 I hope that made at least some sense?

                              <span>We are basically sailing this boat until we move to a new office and will replace all the network equipment. We have a weird issue with the DHCP server. Every time we onboard a new user and plug in their new device it just gives us a unidentified network. But any other user on the network that was there a couple months back can get an address. I&#x27;ve tried statically assigning the wired endpoints with no luck. The other weird thing is when we connect to the Main wifi, it states not internet and when I statically assign an unused IP address, it then works just fine. We have 3 managed switches that I have tried plugging my laptop directly in and still have no luck.

                              <span>Looking to get some confirmation on how to best proceed here. Will be migrating items from two source locations to M365 GCC/Gov&#x27;t Tenant as the destination (hence the reason I am migrating to a new tenant). Destination M365 tenant will be cloud only/no AD Connect in place. 
 Source locations and use are:
  
Google Workspace -mail, contacts, calendars, Drive data - migrating using BitTitan (no issues here and the migration is already pre-staged/processing)
 M365 Commercial/Non Gov&#x27;t Tenant- Used for MS Office licensing and small bit of unexpected OneDrive use. This tenant uses AD Connect to sync users to local AD at the moment and has the company domain name in use as the primary domain for all users.
  
I am planning on performing this migration this weekend and need to confirm what my process should be to either disable or decommission AD Connect from the existing M365 commercial tenant but keep the users intact (just in case I need to manually move any data over)- while allowing me to remove the company domain in use on the existing M365 tenant. 
 I&#x27;m familiar on the process of decommissioning AD Connect in full, but know that can take up to 72 hours and I can&#x27;t make any changes during that time. What process should I be following if I want to make the users cloud only/change their usernames to .onmicrosoft.com addresses from the tenant so I can remove the company domain from the existing M365 tenant at the same time (hopefully in one evening?)

                              <span>We continually have problems not with all mailboxes but with a good portion of having anything other than the primary user folder disappearing. We seem to be able to solve it in many cases by rebuilding the OST but my mailbox, for example, loses all of my shared mailboxes and online archive after a few weeks. One, has anybody run into this? Two, if you have, have you found a solution yet?

                              <span>It&#x27;s really rare that someone comes to me without needing help. So when someone stops to say hi it makes me feel weird. I appreciate it greatly, but it&#x27;s just jarring. I keep expecting there to be something broken, some weird thing that is happening to their computer, or some burning question that could be answered with a google search. Maybe I just need to make more of an effort to strike up a conversation at random?

                              <span>I’m not starting an office network from scratch, but always day dream what id do different.
 What would you guys do? 2 AD servers, the rest in Azure? 100% cloud? Full data center? Okta? Domain joined devices? Identity management? File sharing? Intune?
 Edit: for the sake of this scenario.
 1) No existing network but a basic firewall, a couple WAPs, and some switches 2) No existing servers or means for identity management, users are using Box for file sharing, Google workplace for email, Office apps 3) 50 users expected to grow to 300 in the next 3 years 4) One large office, with dispersed remote employees across the country 5) Mixed environment but primary Windows, Linux and Apple sprinkled in 6) Lots of engineers, using locally installed SW applications 7) IT Staff: 2 man show
 Like to hear your thoughts!

                              <span>A few years back there was a post here from a traveling data center technician in NYC(?). I may be a bit murky on the details but he had a portable standing desk for data center work. From what I remember, it was basically a platform with a single telescoping pole in the center with a rubber foot on the bottom. It came apart easily and packed into a backpack so he could travel from data center to data center working. There was a link to it and it was a small company making these specifically for technician field work. 
 Does anyone have any idea what I&#x27;m talking about? I&#x27;ve searched and have been unable to find anything beyond cheap plasticy tripod options on Amazon that don&#x27;t look like they&#x27;ll hold up for professional use.

                              <span>Assumptions are the root of all evil.
 I constantly screw myself on a daily basis by making assumptions. I can&#x27;t count the amount of times where I have been handed an issue by a junior tech and started working on more complex solutions but in the end it was something simple that someone forgot to check or assumed was correct.
 The only safe assumption is that no one has done anything correctly ever and everyone is lying to you. Users will make things sound extremely severe to get a problem solved quicker, techs will make assumptions and pass those assumptions on to you. If you haven&#x27;t seen that information yourself, then you&#x27;re working off of a paper foundation in the middle of a hurricane. I know this sounds extremely pessimistic, but Dr. House was right all along.
 The amount of time wasted double-checking something is almost never as long as the amount of time wasted trying to solve a problem that you may already know the solution too.

                              <span>Hey everyone, seems like I should be swimming in solutions here, but I&#x27;m struggling a bit. Company is standing up a new enterprise application that is going to be the backbone of the organization. Needs to be extremely highly available and fully support blue/green deployments. The application has a content storage component that just needs to point to an NFS share. Making that NFS share highly available / fully redundant is an exercise left to the implementer, and I&#x27;m waffling a bit on deciding what makes sense.
 Solution needs to be fully replicated, clustered, and highly available (instant failover either during outage or during deployments). We also need to be able to support our DR process which currently is replicating on prem VMware VMs to Azure.
 We were going to go with GlusterFS, but just found out that Redhat has killed that product and we definitely want enterprise support for whatever solution we choose. Their replacement, Cephs, seems to be way overkill for what we need.
 Would love some suggestions! Thanks!

                              <span>People are rightfully sensitive about their name, whether the pronunciation, gender, salutation (mr, mrs, MD, PHD, III) etc. We get many tickets requesting a name change to reflect the user&#x27;s preference, I get it.
 The problem is we don&#x27;t control what an app (Teams, Outlook, 1000 in house apps, 300 SaaS apps, and more) chooses to use.
 From LDAP alone the apps can get SN, CN, givenName, lastName, displayName, etc. Then you have HR legal name, Peoplesoft preferred name, etc.
 Edit: add job title to the mix while we are at it.
 We just can&#x27;t force all apps to use the same source. And if we did, the name would still be wrong from the user&#x27;s perspective many times.

                              <span>this is more of a vent if anything. I think this move Zoom made to rebrand &#x27;Chat&#x27; to &#x27;Team Chat&#x27; was such an oversight. Idk if their marketing people and PMs have no idea what they are doing. or if they simply don&#x27;t care to review changes. 
 My first gripe:
 the changed the name to Team chat. gag. 
  
there is already a product called... teams. nice move Zoom
 not everyone who i am messaging is part of my &#x27;team&#x27;- like someone from a different team or an external person like my sales rep. it would have made 100% more sense to call this Company Chat. 
 there reason for doing this was because people got &#x27;confused&#x27; when using meeting chat vs Zoom Chat. So they changed it for everyone because the free users and guest users got confused. lol
  
But this is the part that got me. is this blog post:
 https://blog.zoom.us/work-better-together-with-zoom-team-chat/
 they try to talk about &#x27;toggle tax&#x27; and then try to justify not using email and just use Zoom Team chat. This is a major SMH 
 &quot;Need to share an important design and the context behind it with a colleague? Don’t break focus by signing into your email account and drafting an email — simply pop into Team Chat, type up a message, attach the file at the click of a button, and hit send!&quot; 
 Can&#x27;t say i have ever had an app tell me &quot;use our app to talk instead of sending an email&quot; that shit is funny. who writes this shit.

                              <span>Just a general discussion really. We are looking to set up a hybrid Azure AD system, as we use 365 but still have various on prem required software, and whilst watching a Microsoft video on the subject, they are trying to suggest people move away from on prem entirely, unless they&#x27;re using software or older systems that explicitly require it. Is this just Microsoft trying to sell Azure and 365, or is it much more of a trend than I initially thought?
 For smaller companies, I don&#x27;t see any reason not to use Azure, but it strikes me that even with a full Azure AD and Endpoint Manager suite of tools, you still lose out on a lot of configuration that group policies offer, albeit it with other advantages too

                              <span>Why didn&#x27;t they change the official build number to 11.buildnumber when they created this &quot;new&quot; OS? 
 I understand &quot;it&#x27;s not new it&#x27;s a skin&quot; and other comments - but really that&#x27;s all windows ever is since Vista came out... 
 Why is it not in their mindset to create a new base build number instead of just progressing 10.something... especially when it is officially labeled differently with &quot;11&quot; in the title now? 
 I feel like I&#x27;m having a stroke running reports and looking at SCCM in general when it still says windows 10 on some things when I&#x27;m certain those are 11 machines now, etc... so frustrating. /rant.

                              <span>My employer hired an MSP to assist with the workload fulfilling T1 requests and more at first. This arrangement has not been working out. All users and management involved agree they are not working out. Even the MSP admitted they are challenged and had to resolve personnel issues internally. I&#x27;m putting aside the fact that initially my whole job description was presented to me on a PPT slide with their name on top before they came aboard months ago and hopes were high. Management has since tried to break the contract unsuccessfully. So, the plan from management was to not make any changes in user support (damage control?) but to collect enough complaints from our users to build a case against the MSP that we can possibly use to cancel the contract. The issue here is that we are quite lite…</span>

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I am looking into refreshing our core switches. One question I am running into is optical vs copper. Most of my current infrastructure is copper, but the newer servers have optical ports as well. Is copper going bye bye? Will there only be optical switches in the next 5-10 years? How will I get cables with pretty cultures to satisfy my OCD?
 EDIT: By optical I mean SFP/QSFP where you can still use copper but many use the SFP+ DAC cables.
 EDIT2: just want to say I appreciate the great responses.

 Static assigned hostnames (no working DNS), NICs, IP&#x27;s and of course persistent static routes. 
 They never had L3 router in the environment to do the routing, they&#x27;ve relied on host routes lol

                              <span>Following the MS article on setting up WEF/WEC using certificate authentication. It says to create an admin user and map the issuing CA cert to the admin user. Does this mean any client using a cert issued by that CA can call into the WEC server as an admin? That seems like a big hole. I can&#x27;t find further info explaining why that user has to be an admin. I just want these clients to be able to forward their events. Any ideas? Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m configuring an Intune environment and testing with drive mappings. I have a single Z: drive using OMA-URI configurations similar to this article, initially works fine. But every day it seems to try to remap it. I end up with an inaccessible Z: drive with a red X over it saying the drive letter is already in use, and then I have a Y: drive mapped to the location the Z: drive originally was, also saying the path isn&#x27;t available.
 I have to remove both, remap Z: and it&#x27;s fine again.
 What I&#x27;m looking to do is a (hopefully) simple powershell script that maps that drive, that I can package as an app instead of a script or configuration profile.
 I can make a script that simply maps the drive with net use easy enough and send output to a file that I can use for &quot;install&quot; detection, but I feel that having a check for the existing drive letter(s) first would be best since there are plenty of already-deployed Intune machines in production that will end up getting this new &quot;app&quot;/script applied.
 I realize I&#x27;m &quot;asking for the fish&quot; here, when I&#x27;d normally prefer to learn how to fish myself, but given that this is already in production I&#x27;m hoping a few of you might have the time and be willing to help me out.
 I can do a basic script in the meantime that will just blanket remove Z: and Y:, remap Z:, and send the output somewhere the user won&#x27;t accidentally delete it, but I&#x27;m sure there are much more efficient ways to do so.
 Ultimately what I am hoping to accomplish:
  
Check existing drive mappings (I&#x27;ve found that it doesn&#x27;t add a 3rd letter, so can probably focus directly on Z: and Y:)
 Remove existing mappings
 Remap Z: to the proper path
 Check Z: to confirm its accessible
 If Z: is fine, send some output to a text file that can be used for program detection so that it&#x27;s not constantly executing against the same machines

                              <span>Hello Admins!
 I have a situation where I have some clients working from home. Due to compliance, I have to prevent them from being able to talk to other devices on the network (such as home PCs, IoT devices, etc...).
 We use ESET Endpoint Antivirus and RocketCyber SIEM/SOC software. Both of those applications have an isolation mode that prevents that PC from talking to anything other than the ESET/RocketCyber console.
 Is there anyway to achieve this type of protection using only software, but still allow WAN/Internet access (so basically it can talk to the gateway and nothing else). The isolation modes in the applications I mention, prevent general WAN/Internet access as well... so they won&#x27;t work in this situation.
 However, since they are able to lock it down to a specific port/application... I assume there must be some way to do what I am describing. I searched around looking for Windows Firewall rules, but those seem to be limited to very specific protocols/ports. I would like true isolation like Wireless access points do in Guest mode.
 Since this is in multiple home networks, I don&#x27;t really have the option to create network segmentation (VLANs, etc...).
 Any help is greatly appreciated :)

 The emails are being sent to a CI/CD pipeline from containers running on our aws delivery platform.
 The ip addresses are internal... class a private ips.
 I received a ticket this morning to request to whitelist the ip addresses to fix the issue.
 I do not think that would fix the issue, as they are interal ips... I&#x27;m a bit confused here. Has anyone ever ran into this?

 it seems that many employees receive fake Microsoft Support calls on their private mobile phones today. 
 Anyone else seeing something similar? What are your plans against it besides sensitizing employees?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m well versed in remote desktop, having operated several for coming up to two decades. However, this is something new to me...
 We have a customer who&#x27;s got 30-40 users within a latency of circa 5-10ms to the remote desktop session host. However, they&#x27;ve just had 4 outsourced users added from India (we&#x27;re in the UK). Each Indian user is around 150-200ms.
 When we have 40 UK-based users concurrently online, the server CPU can sit roughly at 60%. However, if you swap a couple of UK users for Indians, the server CPU will spike and sometimes sit at 90% with spikes to 100% and the associated freezes you get when out of resource.
 Strangely, this manifests itself in a Windows Explorer process taking between 10-20% CPU for each user. However, if you right-click the Windows Explorer process and choose to restart it, the user sees a brief flash on their session as the explorer is reset, and CPU usage dips back to the circa 0% that it normally uses for other users. It quickly returns to the 10-20% range though.
 I was just wondering whether anyone has noticed the correlation between client latency and server CPU usage?

 I like the layout of Zoho CRM, but there are some things in our industry I am struggling to get my head round. 
 Quotes / Sales Orders do not seem to have a cost price or margin? If you are supplying a Laptop to a customer, tracking profit is crucial. 
 It does have a Services section, which is a big plus as most CRM do not. We were thinking of adding monthly services, IT Support per X users, 365 licences etc. However it seems to be hell bent on having services as a per hour item. Which means it doesnt really work. 
 Why is this always so complicated?
 Do I try to customise it, or is there something better out there?

 I was able to install TrueNAS core without an issue however the disk is connected to the HBA card and It doesn&#x27;t seem to show up as a boot priority in the BIOS however I was able to install TrueNAS while it was connected to the card, has anyone else had a familiar experience?
 I&#x27;m trying to perform a BIOS firmware update however I&#x27;m not so familiar with DOS and I&#x27;m attempting to run the Bat file with difficulty xD

                              <span>Hey all - so I&#x27;ve been asked to vet some compliance hotline companies. NOt exactly sys admin stuff but was hoping maybe someone here had some experience with one vendor or another? 
 Biggest issue is that the vendor must be compliant with any EU privacy laws that are in place.

                              <span>Hi there,
 I wasn&#x27;t able to find any relevant user groups except maybe for this subreddit as I saw many posts about EATON UPSses here. The device itself is working fine and I am really happy. But some tiny thing is bugging me.
 I am running an audio interface (RME Fireface UCX II) via this UPS , next to a monitor, active studio speakers and a mac studio. When I turn the outlets of this UPS off in the evening, and wait a little, I can see the display of my Fireface briefly flashing on and off again - every 30 seconds or so.
 The power doesn&#x27;t seem to cause it boot up, so I don&#x27;t see anything on the display, just the backlight briefly turning on and off for a split second.
 This doesn&#x27;t happen if my interface is connected to a different wall socket next to the EATON UPS.
 I have the EATON Ellipse ECO 1200W
 Is this anything to worry about? Can this cause wear on the electronics on high-precision audio devices like these?
 Already sent an email to EATON customer support but you know how these things are - sometimes you hear from them, sometimes you don&#x27;t. Curious to hear your input on this!
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I had a call yesterday with AT&amp;T, during which they were trying to sell me on their &quot;new&quot; Switched Ethernet solution to replace our DIA fiber. (We have multiple locations - most of which have 50mb fiber as the primary connection and some flavor of cable or non-dedicated fiber as the backup.) The proposal looked promising and would save us around $200/mo per location. There would be no managed router, and supposedly I would get an online portal where I can throttle speed in real time. Not a huge need, but an interesting proposition, none the less. Of course, the ATT rep couldn&#x27;t/wouldn&#x27;t give me any other &#x27;cons&#x27; that might be an issue and even said they could get us out of our current contracts and give us the same or better SLAs that we have now.
 So, I come to you, good people of Reddit. Who has experience with this ASEoD product, can offer insight as it compares to DIA fiber, or any other advice along these lines. Have you used this portal they speak of? Is it awesome or meh? Pros? Cons? TIA

 ​
 Which cloud service would you recommend me to use for backing up the data from my phone like photos, contacts, etc., which I can also use for my laptops? I would have 4 devices, in total, for which I would use the cloud service(s). I can use the Microsoft 365 Personal for the phone like I would use the Google One cloud service, or the single option is to use Google One for phone back-up and Microsoft 365 Personal for laptops?

 In this case, I’m trying to rollout the Microsoft HEVC Video Extension codec. I’ve downloaded the appx and other files and I’ve read about how to install it using powershell on a single machine, but I can’t seem to find how to install it on many machines remotely.
 I don’t have intune, our domain joined machines are connected to a local server running Windows Server 2008 (due to be replaced soon).
 Can anyone help me with a good, free method, to roll out these kinds of apps to domain joined computers?

                              <span>So let me preface this by saying that this is absolutely their choice and I&#x27;m not going to try to stop them, I just want to see if there is an alternative.
 The company I work for has been purchased by another company in another continent. It&#x27;s a really good business move for all involved. We&#x27;re now talking about the collaboration between our IT departments, and they would like to migrate into their 365 tenant, which they have done for all of their previous acquisitions.
 I don&#x27;t inherently have an issue with this, but we are considerably larger than their previous acquisitions, and utilise O365 a lot more than these smaller companies (and it sounds like we utilize more than the new parent does with regards to Azure and Intune/Autopilot, etc.).
 I did a very brief stint at an MSP before working here, and there we used some kind of Partner Portal to look after all of our 365 tenants. Is this something that the parent company can do and onboard our tenant as a whole, separate entity? I thought this was the case, but the more I look at it, the more it looks like the Partner Centre scheme is something for resellers (which the parent isn&#x27;t, but the aim is for them to provide licences to us, along with collaboration on projects, so there might be some overlap there).
 Am I barking up the wrong tree here and have the wrong idea about the Partner Centre? Is there something else I should be looking at and have been searching for the wrong terminology? Or is them merging us into their tenant the best practice here?

                              <span>I have a fibre connection to one of our offices but we need a backup connection. I worry that if I go for a different supplier of wired internet as a backup then they could potentially both go down at once by say roadworks in the area or other external factors. Is this sensible to worry about or would different suppliers have their own routes to the building? should my backup connection be wireless?

                              <span>As you already maybe know, last month Microsoft made a mistake and pushed &quot;Preview&quot; updated to WSUS server. More info can be found here: Windows Server 2022 | Microsoft Learn 
 ​
 So all OK so far, Preview updates by default are not pushed to WSUS.
 But If we have Azure VMs, and they use Azure Update Management and for the repository they use Microsoft Update, we will probably get this &quot;Preview&quot; updates by default or not?
 Since we want to get rid of WSUS for the Azure VMs, what will actually happened...?
 If we have for example test environments on WSUS which are without &quot;Preview&quot; updates and then for production use Azure, we are going to have different updates installed there... How do you solve this in your environments, should we also deploy WSUS to Azure, or include preview updates on test environments?

 I&#x27;ve been WFH for about 2.5 years now and have bounced between 3 MSPs in that time. I&#x27;ve been in the field for over 20 years and have had longevity prior to the pandemic;7 years at one place, 2-3 years at the others. I typically move on every few years for the bump in pay (as we all know that&#x27;s the only way to get it done).
 Here is what I&#x27;ve experienced since mid 2020:
 Org 1: Had an amazing infrastructure, good management, and very few political issues within the team. Only problem was that they asked us to remain steadfast during the pandemic because they couldn&#x27;t afford to give us a raise. After things had calmed down and people began returning to the office, we were told they couldn&#x27;t get approval for rais…</span>

Some people had been doing IT stuff kinda on their own, some of them rage-quit at some point, nothing was ever documented. At all. Who handles what, who handles this or that account, where passwords are, or who knows passwords for this or that service... Nothing. At. All.
 The non-profit uses Google tools. Instead of Google Groups, shared accounts had been created, with forwarding rules created as filters. Good luck to the admin when trying to figure out who receives what. In the previous guy&#x27;s defense, this may have been done because we didn&#x27;t have a license that would let us store messages in Google Groups (we now have the correct license).
 Some accounts were created to circumvent the fact that w…</span>

                              <span>We have been struggeling with the Windows startbutton not working on our RDS 2019 servers for a while now. The weird thing is, this only happens for regular users, not admin users. I have been searching online and found that I could run the following command: 
  
Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode –Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”} 
  
This doesn&#x27;t work for me because it gets blocked by applocker. Also in the eventviewer under &#x27;Applications and Service Logs/Microsoft/Windows/AppXDeployment-server&#x27; I see a lot of errors regarding packages that cannot be installed/updated due to applocker restrictions. Example of the error: 
  
AppX Deployment operation failed for package Microsoft.Windows.SecHealthUI_10.0.17763.3232_neutral__cw5n1h2txyewy with error 0x80073D01. The specific error text for this failure is: error 0x800704EC: Deployment of package Microsoft.Windows.SecHealthUI_10.0.17763.3232_neutral__cw5n1h2txyewy was blocked by AppLocker.
  
I tried to allow the packages in our applocker GPO and reboot the servers, but that didn&#x27;t fix the issue either.

 I also tried to delete the firewall rules in the registery, but that does not seem to work either.

 Anyone else have been struggeling with this?

                              <span>Ridiculous task of the week, we&#x27;ve been tasked with securing access to Office 365 for someone using a personal MacBook. With Windows 10 of course, we would Azure register the device and use MAM in Intune/Endpoint Manager with Windows Information Protection. And of course on iPads, iPhones, and Android phones, there&#x27;s app policies available too
 Obviously this is not something we can do with Mac. And as it&#x27;s a BYOD laptop, we are not at liberty to lock the entire laptop down. Is there any sort of data protection policy or software we can use with Mac, or are we SOL? They&#x27;re basically just going to be using Office and OneDrive
 Edit: I did find this from MS, which seems to offer some level of support, but as commenters have already stated, it&#x27;s just a terrible idea and I&#x27;m going to strongly make that point

                              <span>Hi All,
 Wondering if there are any recommendations fellow sys admins have when it comes to professional password managers for a team? We&#x27;re only small but would ideally like all members of the team to have access to the same password vault for admin accounts etc. Doesn&#x27;t need to be anything special, just easy to setup and use ideally.
 Thanks in advanced.

                              <span>So i have a problem with Office 2013 activation.
 We had an old 2012 server that hosted kms but now its time as come and we need to shutdown that server. I done the server licenses and it worked like charm but now when trying to add new Office 2013 keys to new KMS server (OS2022) it says this
 An activation request has been processed.
 Info:
 0xC004F042
 ​
 i had some test pc-s to work with and tried with command -skms to manually add them and it did work and they get the right license but from server it still showing that error, anyone has a fix for that?

                              <span>time and again we receive concerned calls/emails from users who have received a suspicious email/link/file.
 Of course, we in IT say that this must not be opened under any circumstances!
 ​
 I am a sysadmin, not a security specialist. Nevertheless, I (and my colleagues) are curious about what would happen if a potential virus is executed or a link is followed.
 ​
 To test something like this, we currently have an old notebook with Windows 7. The notebook is of course not in the domain and in a separate VLAN without access to the LAN.
 We would like to replace this notebook with a new one (more performance, Win10 etc.).
 ​
 Now to my question: do you have a special computer to test potential viruses, malware, phishing links etc.?
 If so, what is your configuration of the computer?
 ​
 - separate VLAN -&gt; no access to the LAN
 - no domain join
 - Office installed
 - 7zip
 - Wireshark
 Have you created a way to reset the computer after running the file? Restore Point, Backup, Hyper-V or something else?
 ​
 The reason for this computer is primarily curiosity and to rule out any false positives.

                              <span>I will share my knowledge about this case. We are in investigation with the HP Support to solve this but maybe this helps also other people.
 We had this issue on HP Elitebook 845 G7 and Elitebook 855 G7 but i think Elitebook 835 G7 will have this issue too.
 Since the release of Windows 11 we are Testing this new OS version in our environment. A clean install is working great an all policies are prepared. But every upgrade attempt from Windows 10 to Windows 11 ended in a Bluescreen. (UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP)
 Because we had other project ongoing we have waited until Windows 11 22H2. Maybe the problem was solved in this release but we had the same issue. Both scenarios upgrade Windows 10 to Windows 11 22H2 and upgrade Windows 11 21H2 to 22H2.
 After this bad experience we created a case at the HP Support. After some troubleshooting and sending them our logs we have found the issue.
 It&#x27;s the Synaptics touchpad driver. 
 When we remove the driver the upgrade is working fine. Now we wait for a response from HP if they will release a fixed driver.
 I will update this post when i receive some new information.

                              <span>Hi, 
 we need a mail service like mailjet to do bulkmail.
 I would like to avoid using our primary domain for this, or set up a 2nd DKIM and SPF to coexist with our primary mail system, due to &quot;i have a bad feeling about this&quot;.
 I guess because i don&#x27;t want to jeopardize domain reputation, risk being blacklisted, or deal with the consequences of the mailservice being compromised. 
 Which is why i proposed to buy a new domain, with one or two mail accounts attached to it, for bulk mails only, without interfering with other productive mail services.
 A follow up question to this was:
 Would protective services like Microsofts Defender P1 or P2 (or other vendors) recognize those massmails as Phishing or Impersonation? Because there will be  links and images within the body that point towards our primary domain, while the sender address would be from the new domain.
 I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the case, but since i&#x27;m stuck in the overthinking game now, i&#x27;m not so sure anymore. Anyone had to deal with this before?

 Hi, I&#x27;m relatively new to gpg4win, and am trying to accomplish what I *think* is a relatively simple task.
 I&#x27;d like to encrypt and decrypt files from a command line, such that I can script a process to automatically parse files in a folder to be encrypted at regular intervals, or decrypted. I have only one certificate with private key stored in Kleopatra, and it&#x27;s set to my default identity, and &quot;ultimate&quot; trusted.
 I&#x27;ve googled for hours, read through documentation, found examples, but a few of the option switches that are widely referenced don&#x27;t seem to work with gpg4win (IE, --passphrase-file or --passphrase_fl, or even just --passphrase).
 Here&#x27;s my current syntax for a test encryption
 .\gpg -r &quot;KEYNAME&quot; -o testencrypt.gpg --pinentry-mode&#x3D;loopback --passphrase &quot;PASSPHRASE&quot; --default-recipient-self --always-trust -encrypt test.txt
 yeilds :
 gpg: ypt: skipped: No public keygpg: test.txt: encryption failed: No public key
 I&#x27;m not sure if I even need the passphrase for encryption, rather than decryption - but if I omit --passphrase, it prompts for one.
 I haven&#x27;t gotten to decryption syntax, but figure it will be pretty much just the opposite process. I noticed the gpg-preset-passphrase.exe program, and ran it and entered the password there - not sure if that impacts anything.
 Thanks for any insight!
 edit : using gpg4win 4.0.3

 Unfortunately we cannot use OneDrive to redirect user directories and instead are looking to utilise the in-built user folder redirection GPO and wanted to check if anyone here may have used this in the past and can provide any advice or anecdotal tales?
 Our plan is...
  
Use GPO to redirect our user folders (Desktop, Documents etc) to a windows file share using the in-built offline files feature.
 The share will be hosted on DFS and replicated between fileservers across regions.
 Configure folder quotas to prevent users running riot with local files
  
Does this sound like a bad idea?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Dear fellow IT peeps, 
 First question was : https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/y06smj/sysadminsoftware_enginners_is_this_normal/?utm_source&#x3D;share&amp;utm_medium&#x3D;web2x&amp;context&#x3D;3
 I got another question, as i am wondering if this is a common practice which i have not experinced as i feel that it is a bad pratice, or am i wrong, 
 So for example, Customer creates a ticket, ticket gets assigned to wtv team i.e. Hardware team. Hardware team resolves the issues, comments on the ticket saying issue has been resolved, can we proceed to close the ticket, customer comments back about a quey on something that is not related the issue i.e. warranty status of the HD which we have to email the OEM and await their reply. Which will extend the SLA even though the main issue has been resolved. 
 Do you get the customer to create a new ticket or keep the ticket open?
 For me i think it is a bad practice to keep the ticket open, from my experience usually we&#x27;d get the customer to create a new ticket. 
 But then again, back then i was working for companies had some of control i.e. HPE, big IT corps. 
 But the new company i just joined, i am still getting used to the practice, and i was wondering if i should address this as this might give the customer too much power to dictate and of course my previous question
 I find such practices bad and is making things very confusing which in turn would reduce productivity.
 ​
 Am i wrong?
 Or should i address this? 
 I dont wanan address something that would shoot myself in the foot

                              <span>Hello r/sysadmin, I&#x27;m /u/AutoModerator, and welcome to this month&#x27;s Patch Megathread!
 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month&#x27;s updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft&#x27;s Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft&#x27;s updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn&#x27;t work.
 Test, test, and test!

                              <span>Helping my relatives setup their internet / networking where they will be leasing part of the food store to someone else for their deli. They would like to supply an ethernet wire to the deli so they can connect their switch and other wired devices (think POS / credit card terminal / PC) to said switch.
 From my short research, it seems like I would need a managed switch separating the two networks via VLAN. So basically, ISP Modem / Router &gt; Managed switch:
 &gt; Ports 1&amp;2 for the food store &gt; Add another switch (does it matter if its managed or unmanaged?) for the food store&#x27;s wired devices
 &gt; Ports 3&amp;4 for the Deli &gt; Add another switch (does it matter if its managed or unmanaged?) for the deli&#x27;s wired devices 
 Wifi SSID will not be broadcasted to limit wireless devices. 
 Am I even remotely on the right path to accomplish this? There is only one ISP available at this location and they can&#x27;t provide a separate service just for the deli.

                              <span>Hi,
 So I&#x27;m in charge of setting up the 802.1x for a new site we are moving to. I work for a company with around 200 sites around the country and a pretty big DC with ACI, ISE, SD-WAN etc.... all across these sites.
 The normal way of doing things like segregating users has been via VLANS and FW rules. However with this new site I&#x27;ve setup and tested an 802.1x config I&#x27;ve done with TEAP for Windows users, EAP-TLS for MAC&#x27;S and MAB for cameras etc... all working. My plan was to see what AD group the user coming into ISE was in and the delegate them a VLAN tag on ISE and pass it back to the Authenticator switch, it all works. But after speaking to my lead today, he suggested a couple of things or ways of going about doing user segregation at the new site.
 We have been talking about what is the best way to go about IP addressing schemes for users at the site, do we create seperate VLAN&#x27;s for infrastructure/networks, finance, HR etc.... with their own subnets or do we put them all into one big range (a big broadcast L2 domain I know, but kit these days can handle it to be honest) and then look to use SGT&#x27;s on ISE and assign them segregation based off them that way.
 Any opinions or other suggestions would be welcome.
 Thanks everyone

                              <span>Hi, we are having an issue when some of our spoke sites that have 2x MPLS circuts (no broadband etc...) and one circut is a higher bandwidth than the other in all of them, I never set the solution up but it is live in production now and if the primary link fails, then it takes a good few mins to switch over to the second lower bandwidth link. There are 2 static routes going out both links (same administrative distance) but the second lower bandwidth link has been set to the &quot;last resort circuit&quot; command and the primary higher bandwidth link is the only link/interface that appears in the routing table.
 In comparison, the same setup is also on sites that have the same bandwidth across both links, if the primary circuit fails then it is a seamless transition to the second circuit and both static routes are in the routing table to.
 Anyone any advice on where/what I could look to change in order to make this work better and for the second link at the sites with unequal bandwidth links, to be able to seamlessly switch over to the second link?
 Cheers

                              <span>I think they are, but I&#x27;m not a cable tech. I was working with a cabling guy today who said, &quot;Nobody runs multimode anymore.&quot; Is that true? I&#x27;m just learing about actual projects, pricing, so Im not very familiar with whats normal and what isn&#x27;t. 
 We are working on a project where a run from the network room will lead outside, underground through a conduit, and then to an outdoor area. This is about 300ft. Then there will be a run from that outdoor area to another outdoor area roughly 300ft out. To me, that is something multimode fiber can easily handle, but I&#x27;d like to hear what others have experience with. I know the cost will be higher for transceivers, but this is for a third party client. Im not trying to nickel or dime or mess with a sale for a cable company, but I also want to learn.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve taken over responsibility for an Aruba 6000 48G R8N86A switch that in another state and I cannot get signed in. I have an old config file showing the local accounts with ciphertext passwords, as well as the radius config with ciphertext of the pre-shared key.
 Access-Requests hit the radius server (Windows server NPS) and are rejected with &quot;Authentication failed due to a user credentials mismatch. Either the user name provided does not map to an existing user account or the password was incorrect.&quot;
 I am using known good credentials.
 If I change the PSK in NPS, I continue to get the same error message so I suspect NPS client config might have the wrong PSK.
 Question 1. Is there a way to reverse the cipher text on the PSK?
 I attempted to set up new connection request policy in NPS, and under SETTINGS-&gt;AUTHENTICATION I checked the box for &quot;Accept users without validating credentials&quot; and then I see Access-Accept sent back to the switch, but the switch still rejects with &quot;Access Denied&quot;.
 Question 2. Does this not work how I think it would? Any other way to force a successful authentication in NPS to get logged in?
 I also blocked radius traffic from switch-&gt;Radius server to get it to time out and attempt local creds. No documented creds will work.
 Question 3. Similar to Q1. Is there a way to recover local password from the ciphertext?
 There is no remote support at this location. I&#x27;ll have to drive 6 hours to reset it if needed... Lol

                              <span>What&#x27;s the best practice for linking multiple switches to our firewall appliance? As a network novice, I&#x27;ve been running the uplink line from the FW into switch 1, then another line from SW1 into SW2, then another line from SW2 to SW3, so on and so forth. I know this is not a best practice as if one of the switches goes out then the rest go with it. So what would be the be practice here? I&#x27;m using a mix of switches currently, but most of them are Dell 15 series.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi all - apologies if this is too broad or below-brow for this subreddit. Network design isn&#x27;t my area of expertise and I&#x27;m getting a little overwhelmed with the options available - I had some general best practices questions and requests for model recommendations.
 We&#x27;re a small business with around ~150 users with primarily hybrid in-office/remote workforce. Multiple IT staff (mostly developers) but I&#x27;m the one probably best suited for this project.
 Currently an old Cisco SG-500 stack performs all internal layer 3 and layer 2 requirements, core, distribution, access, the works. Workstations and servers are segmented on separate VLANs.
 Initially the network was flat and my goal was to separate and shape traffic between workstations/servers with ACLs on the SG-500 stack. It &quot;works&quot; but I…</span>

                              <span>We have an appliance calling home to report input errors.
 When rounded to the nearest thousandth, most input errors are 0.002%. I read a Net craftsmen post saying that anything above 0.001% should be investigated.
 In most cases, the switch is reporting a 0.000% output error rate.
 In some cases, both the switch and the node show an error rate. Examples below.
 Most of the connections are to the same switch; I&#x27;m not sure this matters.
  
​
  
 Node Node input error rate Switch output error rate 
  
 1 0.002% 0.000% 
  2 0.002% 0.009% 
 
 ​
  
Do you agree with that threshold for error rate troubleshooting?
 If yes, would you clean only the SFP/Fiber on the node side if the node is showing errors but the switch is not?

                              <span>I&#x27;m inheriting a job supporting a SATCOM hub network at a teleport. It&#x27;s a small-ish site that provides Internet or managed network access to a few hundred remote SATCOM terminals via a small number of high bandwidth uplinks. My background is in radio networking (MANET, microwave, trunked voice &amp; data, etc) but I&#x27;m fairly competent with Cisco R&amp;S gear.
 This site has been badly neglected and is in acute need of a tech refresh. It currently has about 12-14 access switches and six routers that manage IP traffic between the modems and other infrastructure, and an old ASA that connects to the Internet and provides remote access via AnyConnect. I plan to replace the switches and routers pretty quickly, and the firewall soon after.
 I&#x27;m going to write a preliminary proposal to outline the tech refresh project and justify funding for subsequent trade studies and eventual capital purchase.
 Now for my question: I&#x27;m a little turned off by Cisco&#x27;s extremely high prices, the complexity of their feature licensing, and also their super long lead times right now. I have positive impressions towards Juniper and Extreme gear, though my experience with them is limited. Given the relative simplicity of this network, I&#x27;ve wondered if I could get by using Ubiquiti or Mikrotik, but ultimately I think we&#x27;ll want a paid support option. Assuming a homogeneous environment meaningfully reduces complexity and risk, is there a single brand that might be best suited for this application?

                              <span>I design IOT devices and a feature I’m adding allows my devices to identify one another on a network. The goal is for each device to be able to scan the subnet and find one another so they can show users “devices found on your network” rather than requiring them to type in each IP/host name. I’ll allow typing in for cross-VLAN or other setups, but would like to suggest them units where possible to make it easier. 
 What is the best way to do this? I see this with things like my tplink controller where it can find my access points on the network and suggest them to me. Is this just brute force pinging each IP in the subnet at a specific endpoint and looking for a certain response?
 Not looking for a full on explanation, just need a term or concept to be able to research more into. And looking for suggestions as I’m sure there are many ways to do this. Thanks!

                              <span>Short version: What is the best way to do a local domain mesh that supports local broadcast protocols, as well as some L2 jiggery pokery on an airgapped network?
 Long version:
 Large scale professional audio/video/lighting networks currently all setup as airgapped switched only networks with a lot of protocols relying on local broadcast for discovery and function. As these networks get bigger we run in to topology problems trying to maintain HA/resiliency/redundancy.
 It gets very awkward when your network is down, the show is stopped and you have a live audience of 20000 people and millions watching on television.
 Most networks end up as a ring (with RSTP or EAPS), or as one long daisy-chain (broken ring). Some folks will run parallel links (that are unconnected until one fails and then the spare gets manually plugged in)
 It looks like TRILL would have been a solution, but it seems that it really never took off, so I am looking at routing solutions.
 Requirements: fast convergence times, once routers are configured the first time: plug and play operation in the field, loop/feedback protection, mesh ability, and the endpoints see all local broadcast traffic.
 From what I gather OSPF/EVPN/VXLAN might be the solution?!? Any other ideas, links or info on configuring those together? Pitfalls?
 For reference, some lighting networks:

                              <span>We put in ACI in 2019 thinking we&#x27;d eventually split out Dev and Stage into separate VRFs and eventually go multisite or some of all the promise ACI has. We had a leadership change and he pointed to the sky aka cloud. So that&#x27;s where we are, multicloud whether we were planning it or not. It&#x27;s in better shape than that sounds. 
 It&#x27;s renewal time and we just don&#x27;t need the complexity or cost of ACI. Knowing the switches (some of em) also support NX-OS mode and with the reduction in footprint we&#x27;ve had since the cloud migration I&#x27;m thinking we can migrate out of ACI by shuffling some links around, Converting some stuff to NX-OS mode and shuffling back. I don&#x27;t have a fully fleshed out plan but has anyone else done it? You know how it is, if you&#x27;re doing something you&#x27;re probably not the first.
 Edit: I know it’s easy to switch between modes. That’s not really what I’m talking about. Asking if anyone has done it and more importantly did you hit your head on the way out? Crazy gotchas etc.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I currently have a pair of fairly critical ASR1002-X routers in our DC that haven&#x27;t been upgraded/rebooted in about three years. They&#x27;re both on asr1002x-universalk9.16.09.05.SPA.bin currently, running in bundle mode and need to be upgraded to asr1002x-universalk9.17.03.05.SPA.bin (will also require a ROMMON upgrade to asr1000-rommon.173-1r.SPA.pkg).
 Can anyone that&#x27;s done a similar upgrade path (16.X.X to 17.X.X) guide me towards any pitfalls/recommendations for the upgrade procedure? Pretty much every upgrade documentation I&#x27;ve found talks about install mode being the best option, should I convert these or does it really matter? 
 Also with the ROMMON upgrade, can that be done in one go alongside the IOS before a reboot or does it require multiple reboots (ROMMON upgrade &gt; reboot &gt; IOS upgrade &gt; reboot)?
 Thanks for the assistance!

                              <span>Hey, just curious if anyone else out there is doing automated testing of their network and how they&#x27;re doing it. 
 To give an example of where I&#x27;m coming from: I&#x27;m working on setting up automated testing at my workplace. We&#x27;re an international L2 connectivity provider and so one of the big products we have are pseudowires between locations. We have automation to deploy services when a customer orders them, but I&#x27;m working on trying to setup automation to test different product configurations and combinations before we roll them out to customers. 
 Trying to cover all possible permutations of configuration is a monumental task and cardinality quickly becomes an issue. For example, say I have 1 physical topology with 2 CE devices connected to 2 PE devices, connected to the other side across …</span>

                              <span>Hello fellow Students and IT Guru’s.
 I am again in the position to generate another 1000 free places on my Udemy JNCIA course, I have been asked why I am offering it free to Reddit / LinkedIn ect and its because if I can give away the course that will benefit others.
 Some instructors just post their courses on giveaway sites and end up getting enrolments that are never used, I want to offer it to people that might at some point have a look and maybe find it useful.
 As a new instructor myself I have found the feedback to be most helpful and once my other courses are completed, they will be offered free to.
 Any feedback is welcome.
 The below code is valid for 5 days however once signed up you have the course for life.
 I thank you in advance and good luck in your studies.

                              <span>Hey guys, we have had a couple of discussions at work about the concepts behind &quot;switchport mode trunk&quot; / &quot;switchport trunk allowed vlan all&quot;. The two commands both accept every VLAN configured on the switch on the trunk ports. So my question is, if there are any disadvantages for network, when the trunks are configured in that way instead of specifying the exact VLANs. We have some delays and higher TTLs in our network and/or some black magic we can&#x27;t figure out. So my boss hat the opinion its caused by the trunk all command. Is that true? We are talking about a VLAN configuration of 20-30 VLANs.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey all!
 Just trying to get a client up with Starlink - we are using tunnels to deliver their public IP and starlink as a backhaul - this all works fine.
 Deployment testing internally - we just setup a dhcp server and added routes based on DHCP like so:
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 dhcp 100
 And a few other routes back to management IP&#x27;s in case of tunnel issues
 ip route 1.2.3.4 255.255.255.255 dhcp 100
 This worked in testing with normal DHCP server, but what we&#x27;ve found since deploying is that starlink&#x27;s IPoE doesn&#x27;t deliver a default route via the &#x27;dhcp&#x27; keyword - i.e. DHCP Option 3 (I believe) and is instead providing the default static route via classless routes (option 121) ?
 The big tell is that a default route is there, but its 254 distance instead of the configured 100, and the /32 routes we added do not get picked up.
 So my question is thus - given we can not get that gateway using the &#x27;dhcp&#x27; keyword on the routes, is there any way to kind of add a route for the /32&#x27;s based on the default route given out in what we assume is option 121?
 I am remote to the site, so can&#x27;t really reliably debug DHCP without kicking my access off, so any help is appreciated to understand my options.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi All, I&#x27;m not sure if my vocabulary is sound on this question. I hope you can decipher it. 
 I have a data network that is roughly 75 drops. The installer mixed the runs for voice and data. So each cable is terminated into two jacks, 2 pair for data, 2 pair for voice. Nothing is labeled, and my toner does not seem to work with these mixed cable runs. The toner tests out fine on a standard patch cable.
 Do I need a different\better toner or is this expected on cables terminated this way?

On paper Junos seems to tick the right boxes of not being a monolithic kernel, linux-based, EVPN/VXLAN support, SDN management and they&#x27;ve been around for decades. I&#x27;m getting my talking points together to talk with management about it, but I &quot;don&#x27;t know what I don&#x27;t know&quot; so I&#x27;m hoping reddit can educate me as to if there is something in production with this gear&#x27;s operation that someone with tribal knowledge would know. Could definitely use some career advice as, the only downside I see is having to learn something new but I could be way off base. Thanks.

I currently have a Frankenstein Nexus layout that is giving an intermittent loop on a vlan (1). It seems to pop up randomly but it does show some consistency with it happening 1-2 time a day.

 I have been able to identify the firewall (HA-FP asa) interface as the kick off of all these occurrences. This device sits on a TOR running RSTP. This is currently configured as an access port. The TOR connects via vPC to two 9500 chassis with the primary acting as STP root. (No peer switch configuration) these are set by separate priority levels. Priority 1 &amp; 4096.
 Under the core we have two more vPC domains running RSTP. The vlan 1 root ports are reflecting correct…</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 Having a bit of a problem driving me nuts and hoping someone can lend a bone.
 I&#x27;ve done a similiar setup before and never had any trouble.
 I have two physical sites with an ESX host in each. All networking machines are inside of ESX. There is a virtual firewall at each site. The two have a Site2Site VTI (Route based) VPN Tunnel between them. Over it I&#x27;m sending VXLan traffic. The VxLan endpoint is behind each of the firewalls, running OpnSense in another VM. No NAT going on inside the VTI. Subnet to subnet. VxLan link is established and I have a stretched layer 2 segment with the IP range of 10.20.171.0/24. I can ping across it. I can browse http across it. But the second I swap the same test/set of ips for https - I&#x27;m unable to browse. In other words, I believed that it is a TLS problem. curl -k -vvv showed it hanging on &quot;Client Hello&quot;.
 ​
 Using the same http host I succeeded with but https did not work with, I did a client side wireshark twice:
  
On Net
 Across VxLink
  
For #1, it worked (ie: the vms live next to each other on the same time).
 For #2, last thing client sends is a tls &quot;client hello&quot; and never receives the server hello back.
 I did another wire shark on the server side, and the server hello IS being sent back, just not arriving at back at the client. OVER THE SAME LINK that plain old http (stateful) and icmp work.
 I&#x27;m absolutely dizzy trying to chase the packets for that particular conversation at this stage. 
 Can anyone think of anything?

                              <span>Background: We&#x27;re currently investigating options for microsegmentation using NSX. This is a brownfield deployment, so we have lots of workloads that are already talking to each other and we need to do some kind of discovery to determine what&#x27;s talking to what on what ports.
 VMware&#x27;s solution is to pay a lot of money for vRealize Network Insight. I&#x27;m balking partly on the cost and partly on the principle of the thing.... lots of firewall products have this visibility for no extra cost once you buy the product.
 Anyone have suggestions for alternative approaches?

 Looking at the documentation online it looks like only the following platforms support ERSPAN.
  
Cisco 6500
 Nexus switches
 Cisco ISR 44xx
 Cisco ASR
 Cisco 3850 ( IOS-XE 16.x)
  
Does RSPAN have more support and can you pretty much RSPAN on any switch? Dell, Cisco, etc?

                              <span>We have some relatively old Nexus 5k’s where I work. They are vPC’d together and support fex’s throughout the campus with workstations on them. 
 We’re having an issue where some of the new workstations getting connected to the fex’s, their MAC address shows up in the table as a static mac being learned over the vPC peer link. It’s the same on both Nexuses, they both think they’re learning it from the other device. We can’t clear it out of the mac table because it’s a static (it will only let you clear dynamic), and when checking the running config on both devices there are no static MAC’s assigned to any interfaces. 
 Has anyone seen this issue before, or found a resolution? 
 TLDR: both our nexuses think they’re learning a static mac from the other side via the vPC peer link, but there is no static mac configured.

                              <span>We are moving offices to a building about 200m down the street for... various reasons (dont ask). We currently have WAN links (fiber LES) to the building but the connection is sometimes problematic, and only 1gbit when its working at its best. We are going to be moving our entire office to the building so to ease this transition we want to link back to the original office with the fastest link we can reasonably set up without spending mad amounts of cash.
 We have looked at possibly using the Unifi UBB-XG https://dl.ui.com/ds/ubb-xg_ds.pdf But its not clear if this is encrypted and/or secure. Regular raw wifi isnt an option in our setup, and laying a VPN over the top means a lot of reconfiguration of routing etc. Ideally we want to extend our broadcast domain over the wifi (not ideal but its only short term) to avoid having to reconfigure all the equipment. Also the speed appears to only be ~6gbit on a good day, despite it having 10gbit SPF+ ports.
 Can anyone suggest a better option? Preferably someone with some experiential knowledge.

                              <span>Hi guys. I’m having kind of a dilemma here. We are trying to achieve network segmentation with port security at our work but there is something I just can’t seem to grasp on how to fix.
 We want to use 802.1x on all access switch ports, the problem is that we use different vlans for difference devices. So printers in VLAN20, clients in VLAN10 etcetera. I want to somehow push the VLAN through authorization policies so that users can move printers without having them stop functioning.
 I want to know what we can do about this in an event where the ISE goes down completely. I know that you can revert to a specified VLAN if the radius server goes dead. But I want that for every VLAN we use. 
 Is that even possible?

                              <span>Hello,
 We&#x27;re considering to buy few new DC Internet Edge routers, we need them just for routing, no need MPLS or segment routing, or other &#x27;fancy&#x27; features, currently we&#x27;re using Cisco NCS-5501-SE. But it has only 4x100G ports, which is not sufficient. So we started to look to other options:
 Cisco NCS55A1-24H - it has 24x100G, but limited scale - supports only ~2.2millions of prefixes. The maximum could be reached in a few next years. So this is not very good. Filter all /24 prefixes would be a workaround for future, but it could bring some new un expected problems, so we&#x27;re looking very carefully to this.
 Cisco NCS 55A1-36H-SE-S - It has 36x100G with Extended scale for prefixes - support 4millions of prefixes, but seems too expensive.
 Maybe you know so other models would be not so expensive as NCS 55A1-36H-SE-S ? Maybe something from Juniper series ? I think every DC operator with quite much internet traffic are having similar head ache these days. Any advices ? Thanks !

                              <span>Hey all,
 Quick question. I&#x27;m setting up some performance SLA&#x27;s for our SDWAN based internet circuits. What sites do y&#x27;all generally use for the SLA servers? 
 I usually use Google&#x27;s 8.8.8.8 and OpenDNS 208.67.222.222
 Thoughts? Suggestions?
 My firewall SLA&#x27;s use Packet Loss, Latency and Jitter to determine best connection.
 Thanks all,

                              <span>Testing an FPR-1010 with FMCv and would like come clarification on the access control policy.
 Normally a firewall with stateful inspection allows outbound traffic to return unless explicitly denied.
 I have a policy configured with the following rules:
 Mandatory
  
Log all connections - Monitor only
 Allow specific applications
 Block &#x27;very high risk&#x27; applications.
 Geoblocking rule
  
Default
  
Allow traffic inside zone to outside zone and inspect.
  
Default Action: Access Control: Block all traffic.
 However, most return traffic is still being blocked on the outside ingress.
 What is the proper way to configure such a policy for a perimeter FPR?

                              <span>Hey im a sysadmin with little experience of networking, but its unfortunately part of my job at the moment.
 We are building a collapsed core topology with our 4 sites (30m apart from eachother)
 The site in the middle has two HA firewalls and each site will have a ring design in the access layer. Each site will also have a l3 switch for inter-vlan routing, connected to the firewall in the middle.
 I am wondering if the l3 switches are even needed since the routing between vlans could be accomplished directly via the firewalls?

Or to be more clear, block all websites except a few? For example, I want to get access to: Google, Reddit, Amazon and YouTube, but all others will be blocked? What solutions exist?
 When I was young, I remember when some sites in my school were always blocked, for example social medias. What can I do, if I want to block ALL sites except only a few?

 It is just the phones which use the MDM to pull policy and such, any point running on signatures on it? 
 We use F5 ASM WAF to be specific!
 At this rate my next post would be - Is anyone connecting the metal detector to the WAF?

 ​
 https://fkeep.io/imgs/i/ptbR.jpg
 ​
 Basically, I want the vouchers to be usable up to X HOURS based on actual use and not when the voucher was activated (which forces the user to use it up all the moment it&#x27;s activated).
 Say user one is issued an 8 hour voucher
 User can use it for a total of 8 hours worth meaning that the user can disconnect from portal when he&#x27;s done browsing online for the moment, in order to have more time to browser online later.
 In the future, I would also need to generate some vouchers that will expire based on when it was first activated (used).
 But basically, I can&#x27;t tell which is which.

 I have two routers: one for internet access, and other other is an LTE router for accessing a specialized service.
 There is no LAN infrastructure so am thinking of bridging the two wifis into one by making one behave like a switch.
 or turn one into a switch and connect it to the second router via lan cable. (with the process, i think i wont be able to access the services of both routers.
 Or i can get a third old router, turn it into a switch and connect the two routers to it. AM not sure if the 3rd rout/switch would be able to broadcast a wifi with the two wifis merged.
 Is it possible to do so or to do routing in a router/switch?
 ​
 its a thought experiment. Glad for any suggestions

                              <span>Hi Friends, 
 Can you please help clarify following doubts?
  
In OSPF, While forwarding a received Type5 LSA to other area, why does the ABR not change the Advertising Router IP of the Type 5 LSA to it&#x27;s own IP? What is te basic reason behind this? If ABR is able to change the Advertising Router&#x27;s IP in the Type5 LSA, then there was no need of Type 4 LSA which meant less OSPF overhead on the network.
 BGP Split Horizon Rule says, &quot;Don&#x27;t advertise IBGP learned routes to another IBGP peer.&quot; The purpose is to avoide loop because as per standard, it is assumed that all of the IBGP Peers will be on full mesh connectivity. - What is the reason that the BGP Protocol designers made this standard assumption?
 Why is does the Route Reflector not change the next hop IP while advertising an IBGP learned route to client? I am trying to understand what made the BGP designers decide for RR to not change the next Hop IP for IBGP learned routes?
 What is the reason due to which BGP designers did not consider EBGP router to automatically change Next Hop IP for EBGP learned routes while advertising towards IBGP Peers?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve got a few logical networks at the office. Internal LAN/Ethernet, Phones/VOIP, Internal Wifi, Guest Wifi, pretty basic). For the network equipment I have a firewall/router appliance, two managed switches, and three wireless access points. 
 Should I have one interface port on the Firewall appliance configured as a trunk for each of the logical networks setup as VLANs? Or would splitting wired and wireless device types into their own switches, each connected to a dedicated interface on the appliance be the better choice?
 What are the pros &amp; cons, and which would give me better or worse performance? Is either approach sound?

                              <span>Hello, I just recently acquired a quarter rack with one 10G uplink and two bgp sessions. I&#x27;m trying to figure out how I&#x27;m going to deploy the network. I have some ideas but am running into some analysis paralysis.
 I have some questions I want to ask. The hosts are going to have 2x1G and 2x10G nics with the 10G being used for storage. 
 I&#x27;m trying to figure out what TOR switch I should use. I&#x27;m also trying to figure out if I should do all the routing on the TOR switch and even do the bgp sessions on said switch or should I just trunk the uplink to its own router and a firewall behind it. I have a xeon d host where I was planning on virtualizing most network functions.
 I&#x27;m probably not going to be able to afford any brand new high end switch so used switch recommendations are highly welcome.

                              <span>We use an MSP, but have been slowly looking to leave them. 
 Today, something odd happened. We noticed that old users account that were once deleted now appeared back in AD. To add to this, a bunch of users that were removed from security groups for licensing purposes, were also suddenly added back to those sec groups. The MSP had dropped the ball on doing back ups for the last few months and we noticed a couple weeks ago and they have been working to get their crap together. So they have been in and out of the network working on this. 
 I’m not entirely sure what happened and why Active Directory suddenly looks like old stuff is there and/or reverted in some way or idk, cause it’s not reverted in its entirety. 
 What are some events or things I can look at in AD to help determined what happened here???

                              <span>Hi ladies and gents,
 ​
 Would really appreciate some help with AD delegation please?
 ​
 with a delegated user,
 I&#x27;m having a problem where, if I keep a users password as is, (for test purposes) and untick the box that says user must change password at next logon, the password is changed successfully.
 But if I access the account tab in ADUC, I still see the &quot;user must change password at logon&quot; box is ticked.
 If I untick and ok, I get that access is denied.
 ​
 what I&#x27;ve done thus far,
 I&#x27;ve created an OU, put some users in it and created a group to whom I&#x27;d like to delegate the permissions of change, reset password, read and write lockout time, read-write pwd last reset
 I&#x27;ve also added read and write user account control, but I&#x27;m not having any luck.
 ​
 Your help would be much appreciated.

 Next time I&#x27;ll encourage a customer power cycle before our maintenance window begins. We do have larger customers with scheduled reboots and monitoring via zabbix if it&#x27;s been too long with reboots queued but this is a smaller division.
 Just a quick sanity check, I have vm console access, I couldn&#x27;t have chosen &#x27;shutdown without updates&#x27; without credentials, correct?
 My other choice would have been to have them shut it down from inside OS, and patch when it came up instead.
 ​
 edit: the therapeutic power of bitching and moaning made the box relinquish it&#x27;s hold on my time. 2.2TB to migrate and hopefully up by start of business.

                              <span>I have a vendor who is sending emails our of their system and is getting flagged for DMARC quarantine. When working with the vendor, their recommendation is to turn this off or make our customers who are receiving these emails whitelist the vendors domain. For 7000 different customers this seems pretty unreasonable. I have been asked to give our management options on what to do. Here is what I have so far. 
 1) move systems to a different account receivable software that will sending information 
 2) email all customers to whitelist the domain
 3) turn off DMARC quarantine option. 
 ​
 Personally I don&#x27;t think 3 is an option but my direct manager wanted it there. I am leaning strongly towards 1 if the vendor cannot find a way to sending this in a secure fashion. Any helpful tips?

 We recently purchased some new server hardware with a lot of excess capacity and it&#x27;s painful to pay for DataCenter licenses for all of the cores when they&#x27;re not being used. My hope was that if I could license per VM cores, it might end up being cheaper than licensing per Hardware-cores.
 I&#x27;m trying to figure out some ballpark pricing but can&#x27;t find any details anywhere. Has anyone done this and would be willing to share?

                              <span>Post of relief that a project final comes to a close tomorrow. 
 This isn&#x27;t anything special, this is my third phone system cutover in 9 years here. We went on-Prem Intertel to ShoreTelSky to a on-prem Mitel 3300/MiCollab system, and now we&#x27;re switching to Zoom Phone. And we&#x27;re only 115 or so extensions, most DID&#x27;s with just a few AA&#x27;s and groups. 
 My biggest issue. Comcast. We moved all 200+ of our DID&#x27;s to Comcast and used Comcast SIP (Via Fiber) for our OnPrem Mitel system. Getting them off Comcast has been a GIANT PITA. We&#x27;re forced to use Comcast for fiber services more or less, but for the love of god and all that is holy never put your phone system eggs in their basket if you even plan on moving from them. 
 We have had open port requests with them for over 4 months. 4 MONTHS We we…</span>

 We&#x27;ve had a number of users that SHOULD default to modern auth but that doesn&#x27;t always seem to be the case. We&#x27;re currently working on forcing to modern auth via GP.
 Happy Canadian Thanksgiving! ...grumble...grumble...

                              <span>I just had this discussion and it reminded me that I wanted to raise this point here.
 My current team lead gifted me with this concept - the turd system. A &#x27;turd&#x27; is a task that shouldn&#x27;t exist, doesn&#x27;t make sense to exist in its current form, and is a pain in the ass to handle, especially in bulk. Turds tends to naturally accumulate into heaps of shit, until either some poor responsible souls goes shovel them, or they get stomped down the drain.
 My team lead is of the firm beliefs that it&#x27;s a good thing for turds to accumulate, as this triggers the &#x27;turd system&#x27; - someone eventually complains that the turds aren&#x27;t being passed in a timely fashion, and after a few iterations this provides the impetus to restructure or remove the task so as to eliminate the source of turds.
 This strikes me as something that is typical of organizations in general. Dumb shit creates work no one wants to do it, least of all the people who realize it&#x27;s pointless. If someone handles it, that process never gets reviewed. However, if it&#x27;s left to break, then eventually decision-makers will resign themselves to changing the process.
 Does your shop have a turd system too?

 Dell have released a new firmware (1.40.20 → 2.0.0) for their PowerEdge MX7000 enclosure, has anyone tried it?
 Release notes: https://www.dell.com/support/manuals/en-uk/openmanage-enterprise-modular/omem_2.00.00_rn/openmanage-enterprise-modular-2.00.00?guid&#x3D;guid-6d5d53e7-0c4a-4ae2-8e15-b49e146be3a9&amp;lang&#x3D;en-us&amp;lwp&#x3D;rt
 We only have one enclosure so any feedback is welcomed.

 I&#x27;m looking to setup an high availability file server cluster and I am not sure if the built-in failover cluster functionality in Windows is the best solution to achieve this.
 Do you have some experience or advice to share ? I&#x27;m looking into any solutions free or paid.
 Thanks.

                              <span>800 is for a server with 2 cpus vs 1800 with 1 cpu. 
 I have 15 vms and 15 active remote users I need to support with 1 machine(this) and 1 pure backup. WIll dual x269x work for that? I&#x27;m looking at 2697a v4 or 2695 v4. Id like 2698 v4 but haven&#x27;t found it.
 What are the actual power savings from going up a generation but only by 1 year. Is the 62xx very different than 61xx? Ive read the gen10 ILO is much better. My IT will all be remote, will that make a difference? WIll they be able to use gen9 remotely without a problem?

We have been displeased with Tech Data for the last 12 months or so, bad customer support, low or inaccurate inventory numbers, slow shipping, etc. Wondering what other vendors y’all use?

                              <span>Hi guys, so, I&#x27;m pretty new SysAdmin, I&#x27;m 18yo and currently on my 6 month being a SysAdmin, so don&#x27;t be surprised that I&#x27;m really dumb. In my Company we&#x27;re having issues with Outlook 2013 asking passwords and no one being able to log in, I searched about it and found It things related to basic and modern authentication, It was enabled and yet It didn&#x27;t work, when I disabled It some users began to be able to access again but others not, when I enable It again everyone went down. I think it&#x27;s better that I disable It for everyone and fix everyone that can&#x27;t log in yet, so I&#x27;ll have the next 3 months to think about a solution and re-enable before Jan 2023 Can you guys help me here? Extra info: OS-W7, Office 2013, I already tried to disable and re-enable modern auth, create/change the 3 Registry keys that Microsoft said that were needed in order to modern auth work, delete credencials from windows control panel, change passwords.

                              <span>Hi. 
 At work I have a folder containing a indext.html that links to maps and folders with building maps, and maps of patch panel ect. Also pictures of them.
 It works, but has some limitations because if the building changes I must draw all lines again if I want to update it. 
 I am looking for a system of some kind (or html tag) so I can have this map as background and write on top of it as a layer two.
 This might not be very good explained, but I hope it is understandable.

 What is the fastest way to install those images onto a few devices that are high priority? Is there any way to perform that action off of a USB HD without a WDS/MDT server?

                              <span>First time configuring MFA on an AzureAD tenant. I&#x27;m having two issues currently.
  
AzureAD &gt; Security &gt; Identity Protection &gt; Multifactor Authentication Registration policy
  
This is not configurable, all of the options are grayed out (I&#x27;m signed in with a Global admin account). Not sure why I can&#x27;t edit anything, the default policy does not let me change the assigned users/groups, all grayed out.
 
 
Using a conditional access policy seems to work, forced my account to sign out and register a phone number (also had phone call and the app as options).
  
When I go into the test user&#x27;s Azure Profile &gt; Authentication Methods, it&#x27;s empty. When I worked a support role, I&#x27;d see the registered phone number there which could be cleared, or changed. Has this been moved? The &quot;new&quot; menu (blue ribbon at the top stating the &quot;new authentication experience) doesn&#x27;t have anything either
 
I also can&#x27;t seem to specify methods, I&#x27;d like to remove phone call as an option, and possibly remove text as well to force the authenticator app, as I&#x27;ve come to understand text is rather not secure, and the authenticator app seems to be generally regarded as a good method. Would this be done through the menu I mentioned in the first issue, the registration policy?

                              <span>External email tagging has been available in OWA, Outlook mobile, and Outlook for Mac since 2021. The most awaited support for &quot;Outlook for Windows&quot; is available now.
 In phishing attacks, attackers send emails pretending to be trusted persons or organizations. To prevent users from clicking malicious links and attachments sent by external users, admins can enable an external email warning tag in Outlook. It helps Outlook users handle those emails with extra attention. 
 Now admins can switch from the transport rule as it has few disadvantages,
  
It takes up a lot of space in the subject line, making it hard to preview the subject.
 As the transport rule might not be aware of the end user’s language, it leads to localization issues.
 Multiple external tags: If the external users keep replying to the thread, it will add multiple [External] tags in the subject.
 When you reply to the external email, they won&#x27;t get any clue that you have enabled external tagging.
  
Admins can enable it through PowerShell. Start enabling external email tagging to alert users, irrespective of device usage.

                              <span>Few days ago, we discussed the newly-released grant control that helps us to apply phishing-resistant MFA.
 https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/xxy1hl/apply_this_new_phishingresistant_mfa_setting_to/
 Today I observed that we can also add a custom authentication type by combining any type of multi-factor authentication.
 By default, Microsoft has categorized three authentication modes under grant control. They are, 
  
Basic multi-factor authentication. 
 Passwordless multi-factor authentication. 
 Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication. 
  
Now the cherry on top of this, we can also create a custom authentication type based on your requirement. You can combine any type of multi-factor authentication of your wish and apply it to your users. It can significantly help in disabling weaker authentication methods, such as SMS and calls.
 How do you think this custom authentication type can be used for your organization?

 ​
 I am hoping someone has experienced this issue or can point me in the correct direction.
 ​
 My Question:
 ​
 Each company has it own AD environment and I can&#x27;t (yet) fully merge them for various non-technical reasons
 ​
 We have two domains: CompanyA.local and CompanyB.local
 ​
 We have also a file server companyA.local
 ​
 The users from the domain CompanyB.local want to access the shared folders.
 ​
 ​
 also , how about file server permission procedure?
 ​
 This environment has two domains involved in a trust relationship. So both sides can authenticate to the other.
 ​
 ​
 ​
 Thank for your help!

 I like to use windows terminal, and I like it to default to wsl when opening. 
 But I&#x27;m using winget more and more, and so I also would like to have a different shortcut that will open windows terminal directly in power shell. To achieve so I&#x27;ve created a shortcut with parameters like so:
 &quot;C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_1.15.2524.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\wt.exe&quot; -p &quot;Windows PowerShell&quot; 
 As you can see the path to windows terminal executable will change at every new update, breaking my shortcut. Taking the time to fix the shortcut every time is not worth the hassle.
 Do anyone knows how to create a dynamic shortcut that will handle the continuous change in the path? I was thinking something like this:
 &quot;C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_*\wt.exe&quot; -p &quot;Windows PowerShell&quot; 
 But of course it will not work

 First of all, I apologises if this is not the correct subreddit to ask this question. If this is the case, feel free to remove this post.
 My situation:
 The service desk I work for is responsible for 12.000-15.000 users.
 The issues we need to resolve range from simple password resets to figuring out why a user&#x27;s account keeps getting locked out (most often it&#x27;s because they have older credentials on their phone).
 We are also responsible for reinstalling software using SCCM if it is packaged or from the vendor&#x27;s website.
 Another task we have is digging through log files, event viewers, debug consoles (Java), ... to figure out what went wrong and why, and try to find a fix for this issue. If we have found a fix we either need to escalate the fix to our 2nd Line, OR write …</span>

                              <span>I have to make my thesis on creating a web course about some basics of network management and monitoring.
 For this I have to create a basic test environment for students to use, and it&#x27;s currently open if it&#x27;s going to be a few nodes inside Virtualbox that the student runs locally, or a school-hosted Eve-NG virtualization environment. I think that besides the basic SNMP theory, I will give some Net-SNMP examples first and then dig into an NMS.
 My instructor has given me two NMSs to choose from: Nagios core and Zenoss core.
 Which NMS would be better to use for creating lab exercises, which are intended to give a basic concept of network management. Should I even pick one or rather use both?
 I have Nagios Cookbook and Zenoss Core Network and system Administration as my source material for both NMSs.

                              <span>These days it seems like every single application needs to have some service or process to keep on running once it is &quot;closed&quot;. At least give us the option to have that on or not.
 When I&#x27;m using an application fine have all the other services running, but when I close the app, close all your related processes.
 Anyone know of a tool do that type of clean up, I&#x27;m almost tempted to build one.

                              <span>I work for a company that provides IT servicies for other companies, we often struggle to have everything under control.
 IE: In the last month we had to patch every Exchange and every Fortigate for some bugs, mailing the client, but finding everyone required too much time.
 We also provide a monitoring software for the IT infrastructure but not everyone is willing to pay for that service so for everyone else, we got to check one by one or check manually every documents of the infrastructure we radct after the installation and configuration.
 What i&#x27;m looking for:Something that when a new infrastructure is installed i can... dunno, click some checkbox for every main system installed so if i need to know who have Exchange I&#x27;ll have a list.
 A plus would be also something that can create or manage a mass mail for every group, I.E., got a problem with one thing, i can mass mail everyone who has that system.
 Do something like this exists? What do you do to keep everything organized?
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>Hi all
 I&#x27;m hoping someone can shed some light before I go a little crazy.
 I know others have also had this problem as I&#x27;ve seen threads, but everyones is slightly different.
 2019 environment running RDS (With FSLogix) (Hosted in a DC)
 365 Apps for Enterprise - Shared License (E3)
 Back in May/June - all users received an activation issue - office wouldn&#x27;t activate at all
 Microsoft pushed me around, placing registries keys like EnableADAL and DisableADALatopWAMOverride then it started to work but I didn&#x27;t really want to use either of these keys long term... I was also advised to use: AlwaysUseMSOAuthForAutoDiscover&#x3D;1 but I haven&#x27;t removed this key as of yet.
 We continued to have problems for the months with Activation (not licensed) or &#x27;these set of folders can&#x27;t be opened&#x27;
 The main fix after a lot of research seemed to have been the Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin was missing/corrupted. I&#x27;ve been able to mostly fix this with a logon script that checks + reinstall with the following:
 if (-not (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin)) { Add-AppxPackage -Register &quot;$env:windir\SystemApps\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy\Appxmanifest.xml&quot; -DisableDevelopmentMode -ForceApplicationShutdown } Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin 
 For the most part, this script has fixed the daily problems but occasionally, for different people, randomly when they logon in the morning, they won&#x27;t be able to open Outlook as it&#x27;ll say &#x27;these set of folders can&#x27;t be opened&#x27; - AAD BrokerPlugin is installed and the main fix is to open Word, go to File &gt; Accounts &gt; Sign out and then sign straight back in. You can then open Outlook straight away - it&#x27;s a frustrating little resolution.
 Has this else experienced this too? Anyone able to provide some insight or suggestions for a final fix?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 We have a hybrid Exchange 2016 organisation. I finished migrating the last mailbox to exchange online. I have updated MX records and autodiscover (now pointing to EXO). We keep AD on prem.
 A the moment firewall port 25, 80 and 443 are still forwarded to our on prem mailserver. 
 The purpose of migrating to exchange online was to avoid the vulnerabilities of exchange on prem.
 So how can I disable OWA, and all unnecessary access from WAN to our exchange server?
 Do the ports still need to be forwarded? I read that some are necessary for AD connect?
 Thomas.

                              <span>Hey guys 👋 first post here cause I’m kinda lost.
 Have a client that uses load balancing on their SQL server, randomly today all their databases on SSMS 2012 are completely inaccessible, drop-down menu on left panel won’t even expand just sits as (expanding…)
 This is my only client using load balancing &amp; I can’t find anything online for this but I’m certain this is due to the load balancing on his sever. 
 All feedback very appreciated :)

 I want to know when a IIS URL rewrite rule was created. Is this logged anywhere?
 Lately there has been found new exploits regarding CVE-2022-41040 - One mitigation is to make a IIS URL rewrite rule. One of my exchanges was missing this rule but has it now. I want to know when the rule was created.

 We&#x27;re taking part in this years Gone Phishing Tournament and have gone through the setup process as instructed. The test email came through, bypassing the mail server filters and I uploaded a list of all users as instructed.
 This morning, I get an email from an end user saying they had received an email over the weekend about a &quot;Gone Phishing Tournament&quot;. It appears they have been sent the same initial setup instructions that I received in September. A quick message trace shows that everyone in the company has received the same setup email! So now this tournament is no longer a surprise to anyone and has basically been ruined. 
 Has this happened to anyone else? I&#x27;ve contacted their support team and await their reply. I&#x27;ve looked back through the instructions and at no point does it say the uploaded user list will receive this email.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m thinking of switching our org (35 seats) from N-Able to Automox. Any input on this? Seems to have way better patch management, but missing some features like remote PowerShell shell, etc.

                              <span>Few days ago, we discussed the newly -released grant control that helps us to apply phishing-resistant MFA.https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/xxy1hl/apply_this_new_phishingresistant_mfa_setting_to/
 Today I observed that we can also add a custom authentication type by combining any type of multi-factor authentication.
 By default, Microsoft has categorized three authentication modes under grant control. They are, 
  
Basic multi-factor authentication. 
 Passwordless multi-factor authentication. 
 Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication. 
  
Now the cherry on top of this, we can also create a custom authentication type based on your requirement. You can combine any type of multi-factor authentication of your wish and apply it to your users. It can significantly help in disabling weaker authentication methods, such as SMS and calls.
 How do you think this custom authentication type can be used for your organization?

                              <span>So I am more of a network guy but as we all do, I wear a bunch of hats and help the server guys alot. We have several (like 10) synology NAS devices in the network for our backup solution. Veeam backs up to these devices. Can anyone give me a good reason these are not ready for enterprise setup? To me they are just a solution thats not really expensive, but maybe not the ideal solution. 
 I have had a 3rd party in our stuff saying X is wrong or Y is wrong and so far its been things that are not actually a big deal. Example: They complained about the m.2 drives the NAS uses as not being enterprise. (The m.2 is simply a cache drive). They have also been looking at the network side of things and making, honestly dumb suggestions. Dumb as in replacing our backbone with a different manufacturer for network hardware.

I have multiple documents online in which they are showing we can do VPC peering that is fine, but how we can create one endpoint which will communicate under openVPN network. We are using ISTIO as our ingress, how to create openVPN based ingress gateway. Please help me.

 Customer creates a ticket on Jira which is accessible via the internet. There is no &quot;service desk&quot; that will assign the ticket to the appropriate team, i.e. Bug team, Development team as the everyone in the company uses 1 account. which is customercareATcompanynameDOTcom
 And we are all required to download the Jira app on our mobile phone sign in with the same credentials as everyone else (customercareATcompanynameDOTcom) meaning your phone gets flooded every other hour for every single ticket that has been crea…</span>

 So Microsoft turned off Basic Authentication and I though I had everything under control. Sadly I missed our own Servicedesk :-D This is spiceworks on-premise.
 Does anybody know of a software that can work as an inbetween so it is possible to connect through Imap/Pop3 and the software can connect to Exchange via Modern Auth?
 Or should I just start looking for a new ticket system?

                              <span>Hello All,
 Basically in one of our servers We got an alert about the CMOS battery
 I contacted IBM with the logs and they sent me a CMOS battery
 I managed to finally remove the old CMOS battery and insert this new one 
 However the CMOS battery bay holder is lose
 The CMOS battery bay in the server 
 ibm 3550 m5 
 Sits like this 
 https://i.postimg.cc/5053cmm0/Screenshot-2022-10-10-17-23-48-027-edit-com-android-chrome.jpg
 And the CMOS battery bay that seems lose has these plastic things as shown below
 https://i.postimg.cc/gkjv4p1r/Screenshot-2022-10-10-17-15-52-984-edit-com-miui-gallery.jpg
 that holds it ( it is NOT soldered to the board ) when I was trying to clip off the last battery I may have losened it
 Now when I plugged the new battery in the IBM server ImM console gives the same error saying something about a faulty battery so my questions are
 @ the server boots up and is functional without any noises and when the new CMOS battery was inserted it changed the IBM IMM time date to 1999 - does this mean anything ?
 @ also do I have to replace the whole motherboard or the CMOS battery being lose could it be a problem ? I mean it&#x27;s placed fine - or could I tighten it from the back ? 
 @ does anyone know what the problem is ?
 Thanks !

                              <span>Hi, we&#x27;re an small ISP that needs a solution regarding MPLS Devices. Right now we&#x27;re using Mikrotik but its so unstable that we decides to get a more better device with limited budget. Any advise what device that should we acquired ? We&#x27;re needs some device that can do traffic engineering and VPLS , capable to the fast reroute on OSPF, and running P/PE roles. Throughput right now is approximately 3-5Gbps, but seems we also need advise to if our traffic reaches 10Gbps between site. Thanks before.

                              <span>Hello
 I have some networking knowledge and experience, but I am still growing my skills and advancing my career. 
 I was thinking about how layer 3 switching for interVLAN routing is more efficient and quicker due to the ASICs and such for routing traffic between VLANs compared to a standard firewall with inspection and such. But layer 3 switching ACLs are very basic and doesn&#x27;t allow any sort of traffic inspection/analysis. 
 Firewalls have all the great security features for traffic inspection and analysis, but can the bottleneck/slower for interVLAN routing to internal systems.
 One scenario I can think of is; lets say you have a media department (10+ people) that works with a lot of large files and directly edits off a network share through a 10gb link connected to their desktops. Using a firewall to separate the server network and their desktop network (as well as all the other standard user networks) may be the bottleneck when it comes to those connections but more secure for internal threats. Layer 3 switching would be faster, but way less security to defend against internal threats as well as more complicated to maintain with ACLs the larger the distribution layer grows. Or is this just a money problem and a beefier firewall should be purchased to handle something like this?
 I guess the question is, at what point do you choose firewall or layer 3 switch for interVLAN routing and ensuring the network is properly secure and why?

                              <span>Hey,
 My company has recently decided to take on a new project. There are going to be around 130 dorm rooms, all of which are going to need a private (Isolated) network.
 Our networking team are planning to just YEET 150 VLANs in a switch stack and hook each VLAN up to their own dorm.
 The question:
 Is there a better way to achieve the same result? This way feels outdated, but I can&#x27;t seem to think of a better answer.
 Thanks in advance.
 Michael

                              <span>Either I’m having a brain fart or it actually has to be setup this way. 
 We have around 500+ street cabinets all providing FTTP to residential properties. The business will be rolling out open gear to provide out of band console access to each and every cab. 
 From what I’ve been told for the rollout the open gear has cellular connectivity and will run an IPSec tunnel back to the DC. Now, in my mind that means we’ll have 500+ IPSec tunnels terminating on the firewall. That’s a heck of a lot of tunnels, is this a typical deployment for OpenGear or is there a better way I’m just not seeing?

                              <span>hey, guys hello, I am writing my resume and I need some advice doing this.
 so in the experience section where we put our projects and all, HR and recruiters insist on in addition to the thing you do you also should add and quantify the impact of what you did in other words the added value of the project, I totally understand this but as network engineers how we can quantify this?
 for example, let&#x27;s say that I deployed the X firewall in the Y company or I configured a VPN between the main site and the secondary site how can I quantify and measure the added value/impact for these projects? if we take let&#x27;s say a digital marketing agent he can just say that he did the X marketing campaign that increased traffic by Y% to the client&#x27;s website or increased sales by Z amount, i cant figure out how to have a similar take for network engineering?

                              <span>In packet-switching networks, there exist four types of delays:
  
Processing delay
 Queuing delay
 Propagation delay
 Transmission delay
  
Are these delays due to the implementation of the store-and-forward flow control?
 And if another flow control (like cut-through switching or worm-hole switching) doesn&#x27;t that affect these kinds of latency?
 For example (according to my understanding) in cut-through switching the processing delay is almost eliminated if not at all.

 The company&#x27;s growing and we&#x27;re attempting to plan for the future and it looks like we may outgrow this setup.
 For those of you in these dual environments, are you running a combo of Intune and Jamf (or similar), or is there a better &quot;one size fits all&quot; solution?

                              <span>Have been trying to find some tutorials and software for diskless booting of windows 10 from iscsi (not just install, but full on running) and all videos and blogs are like from 2009, referencing windows XP and 7 at best. Which makes me wonder, is this still a thing ? are there any tools with proper enterprise support for it out there ? MS support page for windows server has a section about benefits o booting from iscsi, but totally does not explain how to do it.... Can someone point me in the right direction?
 I&#x27;ve got an environment with a large SAN already in place and a lot of hardware rotation for client workstations, where booting from iscsi would be perfect solution to a lot of challenges

One of our network engineers noticed a lot of Broadcast (ARP) traffic with the info stating &quot;Who has ? Tell &quot;. Does SolarWinds Orion normally behave like that in a corporate network? I sort of get the idea that it might, but it seems excessive the amount of broadcast traffic we are seeing at any given point, even if we aren&#x27;t doing discoveries at that point.

                              <span>Hi,
 so I have this one client who wants to migrate from O365 to Google Workspace (reason is not important). Circa 50 users.
 I already tried all the tools that Google recommend for migrating from O365 but NONE of them worked and the documentation is DOG SHIT. The only way I was able to migrate a mailbox (test mail) was manual process by making a content search on O365 and uploading the PST file to Gmail. I need to automate the migration and I am now thinking if I should rather just create my own migrating tool with powershell/C# and use Google/Graph REST apis... but that could potentially scale the price 3 times the initial budget.
 Has anyone here migrated from O365 to Google workspace (Gmail primarily)? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks.

 while https://www.leagueoflegends.com works perfectly and is their main page, if you go to https://leagueoflegends.com which should redirect you, you receive an SSL Error.
 Small blunder but that happens during &quot;Worlds&quot; their biggest tournament and I would love to see if the click rate dropped since the cert got invalidated (yesterday).
 Happens to all of us, so monitor your stuff and try to always have documentation for these changes in order to not forget some .conf files!
 Have a quiet weekend and don&#x27;t forget tomorrow is read-(mails/tickets)-only Monday
 Edit: Riot saw this thread and apparently fixed it:)

 I have users that work on company laptops (ad-joined), they log in using their AD credentials as Standard Users.
 When they work from home, they connect to the company VPN. However, if they won&#x27;t connect to VPN, their credentials are cached on the laptop so they can still log in to their account.
 Sometimes, let&#x27;s assume that the VPN connection is broken, I want to remotely configure a setting or two (via Anydesk) using a local administrator account without being connected to the VPN. Not being connected to VPN means that I cannot grant a user local admin rights to overcome this.
 How can I configure a local admin account (maybe with cached creds) so that I can still support these remote users? Actually, what I am asking is the best practice covering both security and ease of access, how are you guys implementing a similar case?
 I should mention that we are not using LAPS or any other Endpoint Privilege Management software, we are considering this scenario though.

                              <span>Microsoft has now disabled basic auth for Office 365, with the minor exception of SMTP. While SMTP Basic Auth is not going away because of mostly legacy devices or applications, it&#x27;s better to switch to oAuth 2.0 and Graph API as per Microsoft&#x27;s recommendation.
 The more significant issue is that Microsoft points you to Graph API documentation, specifically this link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/user-sendmail. If you want to upload attachments higher than 4MB, they send you to this link https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/outlook-large-attachments where after a brief moment, you decide to drop that idea and not send emails with larger attachments ;-)
 Over one year ago, I wrote a PowerShell module called Mailozaurr, which simplifies sending emails with SMTP using BASIC …</span>

Our CA is about to expire but the certificates issued by it are valid for another year. Can we simply replace the expiring CA with a renewed one and the already issued certificates will continue to be trusted? Or do we need to reissue the server certificates as well?
 I ran a test on my PC by just replacing the CA in my certificate store and browsing to some internal sites. Chrome automatically accepted the new CA as the issuer but Firefox did not.

 How do I know what she has done?

They class the vulnerability as CVE-2022-30190 and for server 2019 I need KB 5014692. When I click on that link, there is no mention that this KB addresses the issue and it mentions a different cve number.
 Any idea how I am supposed to be reading these CVE numbers?

                              <span>had an unusual issue with my linux server (ubuntu 22.04LTS) today where I would get the following behaviour:
 ls of my users root directly would hang until ctrl+c
 tab autocomplete when used in home directory would hang and lock up the shell
 other random issues which turned out to be things trying to look in the home directory 
 turns out its the windows 11 RDP bug causing an issue with XRDP and the thinclient_drives directory causes this unusual behaviour. 
 disabling the UDP part of the rdp client on the windows box solves the issue.
 more info on the issue that seems to cause this behaviour here:
 https://pureinfotech.com/windows-11-22h2-bug-remote-desktop/ 
 there may be a way to block the issue server side too but I havent looked
 this had me going around in circles for a bit as linking &quot;ls&quot; not working on linux server to a windows rdp client problem was unexpected... 
 although probably an edge case of using rdp to connect to a linux box I figured I would drop this here just in case someone is pulling their hair out.

 The name of the AD domain is using a routable, owned domain MyCompany.net.
 However, our email and public domain is using MyCompany.com.
 Now we are migrating to M365 and Azure AD as our preferred IDP and AWS for our computing platform.
 What advantages would I gain in using natively the .com DNS zone ? Should I be looking at how we ccould switch to using the .com TLD ?

                              <span>Hey there. First time post long time lurker.
 My general question is this: When should I generally start looking at migrating over to the sysadmin side?
 I always find it hard to determine when to move up due to the incessant voice in the back of my head telling me I don&#x27;t know enough yet. Basically just looking to get outside opinions on if its time to move onwards and upwards. 
 My experience is as follows:
 3 years government contractor service desk
 2.5 years MSP work as a &quot;engineer&quot; but still basically a t2 service desk that handled everything that could be remotely done
 Currently at a top backup solutions company as a support engineer for about a year
 Salary is around 65k currently so im only slightly lower than the sys admin range already for my area
 Certs:
 Windows operation system fundamentals
 Fortinet NSE 1-3
 Cloud +
 Could pass Security+ in about a week or 2 
 Any opinions helpful and feel free to remove if this isnt the right place for this but just looking for some help!

                              <span>So TV is not an issue. Able to cast from non-organization laptops.
 Also tried to cast from company laptop to a microsoft wirelessdisplay adapter, same issue.
 ​
 Have read items about GPOs, but so far I&#x27;ve found no GPO affecting wireless settings that would block miracast (allow creation of public profiles, uncheck &quot;don&#x27;t allow wifi-direct groups&quot;)
 ​
 Tried a brand new pc and installed to it the web proxy, antivirus, firewalls, etc.. and it still seems to connect fine. So something to the other pcs is causing the connection to block but can&#x27;t pin point anything.
 ​
 Checked on Event viewer, wlan autoconfig log and I do see it starts and connects and then stops it, but nothing telling anything as to why it&#x27;s doing it.
 ​
 Anybody ran into anything similar?
 ​
 Company just built new state of the art facilities with lots of TVs and well this will look terribly on me unable to cast laptop display on these screens. I&#x27;ve put HDMI on some, but I know it&#x27;s just convenient to do the miracast. 
 ​
 Tried an HDMI wireless transmitter, that works, but image quality sucks.

 If a disk fails with a RAID 0 setup, is data recoverable from the remaining active/working disk, or is the data completely useless given that striping writes each file across both drives?
 Thanks

 Besides physical destruction, is Parted Magic the best way to securely erase an SSD? Is it true that enabling Bitlocker after data has been copied on the drive is useless?

 We’re about to change out anti-virus to Defender for Business. I’ve got it working for windows 10/11 but server 2012r2 seem to be having issues. Got it enrolled via the onboarding script but I’ve got an alert saying “onboarding for defender for endpoint failed to register to ADD due to ADD connect missconfiguration”. The server is not in ADD as it’s not supported. Server 2012R2 is supported for Defender for Business…. Is there something I’m missing? Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>I work IT and a co-worker / friend left my org for a net admin position at a local college. I was chatting with him via text to say hi and asking him about the job, etc. He mentioned they don&#x27;t use NAT and that all the devices are assigned public IPs, which he also said are all behind a firewall. I replied with concern and confusion and he just said that the college was issued a /16 block back in the early Internet days and that they&#x27;ve just been using those. We didn&#x27;t really chat much more but I was wondering about this. 
 Wouldn&#x27;t this be a massive security concern as well as a massive waste of public IP addresses? Also, how would you be behind a firewall and also be using public IPs without NAT unless your router/firewall was right at the ISP level? 
 I&#x27;m assuming I&#x27;m missing something here so I figured I&#x27;d ask for some insight in this sub.

                              <span>I made a mistake and ordered a ISR 4221 Cisco Router to upgrade from a 1921 for one of my clients as I am a freelance admin for a few people in my local area and it’s capping our network speed on all our devices to 35mbps or lower. I know I need to purchase a BOOST license to increase the speed and in turn it’ll cost me some features but is there a way to do this without the license ? Any alternative’s anyone could suggest would also be greatly appreciated, thanks for reading!

In NPS, we have two policies; one for allowing domain joined devices, and one allowing domain users. When a domain joined laptop turns on and Windows starts, it connects to the SSID specified in a GPO assigned wireless profile (hitting the &quot;allow domain joined devices&quot; policy), and when the user signs in, authentication to wireless changes to the user (hitting the &quot;allow domain users&quot; policy). Simple. MSCHAPv2 EAP-PEAP, valid certificate, it works.
 Problem 1: BYOD. There&#x27;s a separate WPA2-Enterprise BYOD SSID that also uses NPS so users can connect with their own credentials. The obvious problem here is that anyone can simply use their credentials with t…</span>

                              <span>Assuming you have bought a full featured DWDM setup, and have the correct fiber and SFPs to support the additional lambdas, do the hardware companies charge for adding a lambda?
 Question I am really asking is about Googles decision to charge for 4k video. Is Google having to pay extra for the incremental bandwidth to the ISP exchange sites? Don&#x27;t they just turn up an additional lambda on a link to deliver more bandwidth from their Datacenters \ Edge centers to the ISP exchange? 
 I am assuming they are using 10 of the 16 lambdas that their gear has available, and they just need to increase to the 11th lambda, and there is no cost for that incremental lambda.
 Obviously when they need to bring up an additional fiber link, and activate a full port and pay the full freight for that link.

I measure the network convergence time (not in the event of a failure, but in what time from the moment of starting the network the convergence is achieved, of course, excluding the times of starting the router) and the lower time results are achieved by IS-IS. I can&#x27;t understand why this is happening, because to my knowledge both protocols calculate the route with the same SPF algorithm, and in the point-to-point setting both skip the DR/BDR and DIS selection step. Research is done on the same equipment, repeated many times, the trend is always the same. Could someone explain where the better result for IS-IS might be coming from?

 Client B is running a Web browser which is sending requests to 127.0.0.1:1234 HTTP Proxy, which encrypts and sends the packets ahead to Client A&#x27;s machine then to -&gt; ISP -&gt; Public Internet.
 
  
By what means could it be possible for Client A&#x27;s machine to sniff or intercept the unencrypteddecrypted packets between Client B&#x27;s web browser and the HTTP proxy on 0.0.0.0:1234?

 How can this be done?

 I got it working. For some reason opnsense did not like using only tagged VLANS on an interface. Once I chose and setup one of the VLANS to be untagged, I could setup all others as tagged. 
  
I&#x27;ve been trying to get a little lab setup using two Zyxel GS1900-XX switches. It works fine if using just the main (GS-1900-24) switch. But no go if using a port on the office (GS1900-16) switch. It seems that VLAN 5 (LAB VLAN) is not traversing the link between the two switches (port 24 on main switch &amp; port 15 on office switch), although VLAN 1 does just fine.
 If I plug my laptop into port 5 on the main switch (untagged VLAN 5), it successfully pulls a DHCP address from the VLAN 5 interface on my router connected to the main switch (ports 3-4, LAGG, tagged VLAN 5).
 If I try to plug the laptop into any of the 6 x VLAN 5 ports (ports 1-6, untagged on office switch) it will not pull a DHCP address and cannot ping the VLAN 5 router interface (10.71.17.254) if I set the address manually.
 I am including screenshots of all applicable switch and router settings.
 I would really appreciate any help I could get from you fine people.
 Thank you!

 Can someone explain at what point in the DORA process does actual time play a role? And also how the time is used? Would really interest me 🤔

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I have a Dell M1000e with 4 M630 blades with Intel X710 10Gb network adapters and a single M8024-k in slot A1. I cannot seem to get any of the blades to connect at 10Gb/s, they all negotiate to 1Gb/s.
 I have one blade running Ubuntu Server 20.04, and three running Windows Server 2019. None of them will negotiate the 10Gb/s link. The Ubuntu box gives me an option to force the link to 10Gb/s but it loses connection, and the Windows ones provide no configuration for it.
 I have also tried forcing the connected switch ports to 10Gb/s for the blades (also tested with forcing it on the Ubuntu blade) to no avail.
 The M1000e has the v1.1 midplane, the switch has been upgraded to the latest firmware, and I&#x27;ve installed the latest intel drivers on the windows blades.
 I also have another 10Gb/s switch and a 10Gb/s NAS plugged in to the external SFP+ ports and both of those negotiate 10Gb/s without issue.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

                              <span>I work in a medium-sized company and am responsible for IT. Although I&#x27;m bad at networking, that&#x27;s also part of my responsibility. Recently, when starting the computer do not get into the network. Only some do not find the network. And it may be that this does not occur every day. We have a DHCP server which distributes the IP addresses. Sometimes computers just don&#x27;t get an IP address and they get a default IP and are not in the domain because they can&#x27;t find the DNS and DHCP server. The workaround is when you unplug the network cable and plug it back in or turn the PC off and on again. Both does not always work and you have to test which variant works. Of the 250 computers, not always the same computers are affected, but different ones. Now my consideration is to give each computer a fixed IP address, there is otherwise no solution. Is it usual with a company size to give the computers fixed IP addresses? Or is a DHCP server the better choice? Sorry for my bad english

                              <span>I have a situation where a departed employee was working on building a web portal using Azure for SQL, web portal for e-commerce etc. There was a service account created and I noticed that it has the Global Administrator role among other roles like exchange administrator.
 I do not see the need for these roles to be added to the service account to remove another point of attack but unsure of any repercussions that may happen if removed.
 ​
 As far as I see all the service account needs is to have the owner role for the Azure stuff that is separate from administrating anything related to AD Azure or O365 but want a second thought.

 I hope everyone is doing well this weekend. 
 First time posting on reddit and here, we have a hypervisor in which we are going to repurpose into a file server using TrueNAS. 
 The server motherboard is: X9QR7-TF+
 I would like to know if I can perform a firmware upgrade so that IPMI uses HTML 5 instead of Java, I can&#x27;t seem to find any information on it and I was wondering if anyone else has the answer? 
 Thank you in advance

                              <span>I apologize if this post is against the rules. I&#x27;m not asking for support. I&#x27;m wanting to either confirm or deny a perception I&#x27;ve made.
 It seems like Windows can occasionally become erratic in small ways until I install pending updates. This can be anything from weirdness with a mouse being difficult to control to losing internet connection on a single machine seemingly at random. Other devices are fine. What has me pointing to Windows updates specifically is that even though my apps, test pings, etc. all return error responses Windows update can sure as shit download updates and install them no problem.
 These usually go away with the handy dandy restart as well (even if I don&#x27;t install the updates yet) but crop up soon again before long. I&#x27;ve noticed this for years and ran into it again today (the no internet issue specifically) and finally thought to ask. Between these periods my experience is pretty good until they happen again and quite usually there are pending updates. Rinse and repeat. It&#x27;s not even an every time thing though quite often I am prompt about installing them once I notice the icon. Occasionally when I&#x27;m not though is when I&#x27;ve noticed this behavior.
 What gives? Am I mixing correlation/causation? It&#x27;s hard to imagine Windows having poison pill code to prod users into installing updates, but honestly it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me either.
 Edit: Thank god I&#x27;m not alone. 🙏

                              <span>I have been in IT for 28 years and I don’t remember a time when a recruiter hit me up at work email address to see if I was interested in a position. I have never worked with this agency or this person. Just thought it was strange. Is this unusual or is this becoming normal?

                              <span>When I set out to implement syncing with cloud-hosted Snipe-It, I wanted a solution flexible enough to deal with possible problems in the source data. The result is a set of PowerShell scripts utilizing snazy2000&#x27;s excellent SnipeitPS module ( https://github.com/snazy2000/SnipeitPS). The main premise is flexibility, working off cache wherever possible, and creating and assigning entities in snipe-it when needed (departments, companies, locations, etc.). The scripts can be found on github at https://github.com/mattcarras/SnipeItSyncPS.
 Quick tidbits about each script:
 - SnipeIt-Sync-PS.ps1: The main API script, which is dot-sourced by the other two scripts. Requires snazy2000&#x27;s SnipeitPS module.
 - SnipeIt-AD-Sync.ps1: Complete script for syncing user information from AD. Syncs the SID to the EmployeeNum field by default for greater flexibility. Supports all fields supported by SnipeitPS, including syncing info about departments, companies, and managers, as well as setting groups. Also supports flagging or deleting users which no longer exist in AD. Should work with minimal changes. Also technically supports updating passwords, it&#x27;s recommended to use SSO instead.
 - SnipeIt-Asset-Sync.ps1: Script for syncing asset information from previously exported CSV, direct from SCCM via WMI, direct from AD, or direct WMI queries. You will need to set the fields in each function to match whatever you&#x27;re importing.
 Hopefully the scripts may prove useful in some way. Feel free to build your own syncing solution using parts or all of the API. And while the scripts are currently being used in an enterprise environment without issue, feel free to submit bug reports on github if you encounter any problems.

                              <span>Hi all,
 We’re managing Chrome updates via Intune policy (the old method with OMA-URI components). Found that several user groups weren’t being governed by this policy and added them. Now I’m potentially in some dire straits…
 Some users who had newer versions than what we needed to use had their Chrome installs rolled back to the assigned version. When this happened, is basically reset the browser to zero - all bookmarks, passwords, auto fill data, etc. is gone. I verified by doing it to my computer that you can restore the data if you were signed into a Google account before the reset (sign back in and turn on sync).
 However, if a user wasn’t signed into a Google account before their browser was reset, does anyone know if there is any way to restore this data short of a full system rollback?

 We struggle to keep a lid on subscriptions and cloud resources for our tiny organization. Large companies (and government!) are probably oversubscribed massively.
 ​
 Since inception, one of the top reasons to &quot;go cloud&quot; was the flexibility of ramping up and down as the business climate dictates. Now many organizations don&#x27;t even have a handle on their cloud spend. It&#x27;s going to be almost impossible to cut back on these expenditures.

 “TeamViewer we chose not to continue using your platform beyond the initial 12 month term we paid for up front, and you sick a collections agent after us for &quot;future services.&quot;? 
 Good luck with that... And fair warning to everyone in this group actively using #Teamviewer. The fine (very fine) print will have you tired to them for at least another annual contract for the &quot;thanks for being a customer, sorry to see you go.&quot;”

 I am hoping to get a creative solution for what I am looking to do. 
 I want to prepend text to the subject of messages identified as spam or potentially malicious for ALL incoming emails, but want to only move messages from certain external domains to a user’s Junk Email folder, organization-wide.
 It seems impossible to both move items to the Junk Email folder AND prepend the subject, in general. 
 Is there any possible creative way to achieve this? 
 Thanks in advance!

 We have a small IT desk internally and I am &quot;Running the Show&quot;
 I am basically doing about 8 jobs, and recently it&#x27;s become too much for me - no downtime, constant stress, working weekends, evenings, no switching Off.
 I haven&#x27;t left the country in 8 years because I just can&#x27;t be away. I work lunch every day and rarely take more than 5 days holiday a year for the last 6 years. I can&#x27;t be away from my phone ever. I work insane hours. My weekends and evenings are work. IT Security also stresses me out. 
 Our Company is growing at an exponential rate and the board of Directors are not listening to genuine concerns that I have regarding the IT infrastructure not aligning with the growth plans.
 Long story short, I started looking elsewhere after being …</span>

                              <span>We have a Citrix environment with Server 2019 servers. We would like to have our users Outlook mailboxes indexed and be able to roam this index between the Citrix servers. We use O365/Exchange Online so the mailboxes are in cached mode. We are using Citrix UPM for handling the user profiles, and FSLogix Office Containers for handling the cached ost-files.
 ​
 Everything seems to be working fine, except the fact that the search index for Outlook does not seem to work. We are letting Server 2019 handle the search database - not UPM or FSLogix - as per MS recommendation. We can see that the per-user database (.edb file) is created in the user profiles. However, they do not seem to update and the size of the .edb files never increases from the initial size of 8196 KB. 
 When we look at the indexing status in Outlook, it shows that Outlook is a location that should be indexed, but it also shows that 0 items have been indexed. And it shows that 0 items are still needed to be indexed. 
 On a normal Windows 10 PC with Outlook it shows how many items have been indexed. And I&#x27;ve read somewhere that the size of the per-user database .edb should increase, when indexing large mailboxes. 
 So what is your experience - is it normal that Outlook shows 0 items indexed? To me this indicates that something is not right? And should&#x27;t the size of the .edb in the user profile increase, when indexing large mailboxes (10-15 GB ost-files)? Thanks!

The user being lockout every morning, I check the event id 4740 (Lockout), is earlier the time that the user tried login (I work together with her). The caller computer name is blank instead of login computer name for normal failure theshold reached. May I know what information I should check to indentify the root cause of the lockout.

                              <span>Dear all,
 I recently got a used LTO-7 for quite a bargain - almost for free so no hard feelings here.
 Its IBM FC HH drive, connected via FC 8gb qlogic qle2562 to server, put in a BDT Flexstor II (oem tl2000/ts3100/msl2024...) 24 slot library
 The drive however acts a bit strange. When booting up everything is ok, no errors, no faults, no lights...
 The drive passes ITDT health test with all passed. Since i only use lto6 at home i also only tested lto6. Speed it does in health test is 151 mb/s, not full 160, but no failure either.
 I then started full write test. That fails after about 1 hour with EC 6 in ITDT and F3 01 SCD 5 Dtive broken on the library. Wont accept tapes or anything unless powercycled. After powercycle all good.
 What i dont understand is, why does the drive pass health test but fails full write. Both failed ok, but one passed one failed doesnt add up for me.
 Use data: 12/2018 built, 1200 day Power on time, 40 power cycles, 40 cleans so far in lifetime, 3000 catridge loads.
 Newest firmware is installed.
 My first guess due to the high load count is worn out head. But can you really wear out a drive in just 3 years? My other hp drives are 8-10y old and work super fine. Or do you have any other ideas, suggestions, tips?
 If its the head: does anyone have a source for the spare? I am not afraid of a bit DIY, and wont pay 1500 eur to a company to fix it for my home use case (used just for me ar home, have 3 working lto6 drives so i am fine).
 Would be great to find some help.

Since I have gathered over the years Apple and Android devices that I am not using after upgrading to newer devices, I want to use them to setup a small MDM test environment at home to do this. What is a good and free (not trial version if possible) MDM environment with as much capability as possible that I can manage in Windows for Android and iOS devices?

                              <span>Right. So our old manager was let go and I was promoted to technical team lead. I work for an MSP and I&#x27;m not exactly sure what a tech lead is required to do. For the most part a big chunk of this job has involved reporting and tracking projects and SLA for the support desk. 
 Any ideas of what a technical team lead is supposed to do?

 The &quot;Certificate Validation Failure&quot; is hitting our Mac community hard and is a growing issue for us. Certificates are deployed and placed in the System keychain via MDM w/ access to the required cert granted to the AnyConnect VPN client.
 Everything else in our configuration can read and access keychain items without issue but AnyConnect appears to have a really hard time validating the certificate it needs.
 When a user is hit with the cert validation error, they can &quot;fix&quot; it by running &quot;security unlock-keychain&quot; in Terminal and successfully activate VPN on the next attempt.
 Is anyone else dealing with this in macOS Monterey as a consistent issue?

                              <span>Hi,
 I guess a question for those who were sys admins at one point and have moved onto other specifically non-management roles?
 How&#x27;d you do it and did you choose or was it more of a progression from your previous role?
 I&#x27;ve been working in IT since 1998. I did what I guess was the natural progression of 1st level helpdesk -&gt;desktop support -&gt;sys admin. Made it from my 1st job to sys admin in 2.5 years and aside from a few failed forays into other areas, I&#x27;ve remained a sys admin almost exclusively since early 2001. I had a brief go as a team leader/management and discovered very quickly it was not for me. 
 I&#x27;ve been working project implementations exclusively for 5 years now and do enjoy the work. I tend to become the goto guy fairly quickly on projects (not saying I am perfect or know everything, far from it. I think it&#x27;s just an age/experience thing and probably happens to everyone who has been around for 20+ years and a lot of the ppl I work with are younger than me)
 I&#x27;m curious about infra architecture roles but really don&#x27;t know what the day to day is like and how to go about moving into that area.
 Thanks!

I certainly don’t want to run through the installer 10 times. Is there any way to build images with e.g. LUKS configured, dropbear installed, timezone end locale applied etc? What’s the easiest way?

 I receive a few emails a month containing DMARC Report Domain: domain.com. I&#x27;m not sure if need to action them, and if so, how to.
 Just now though, I have received a lot of them at once. I have attached 2 images . I&#x27;m hoping someone can explain what triggers this to happen and if I need to do anything.
 Images: https://imgur.com/a/HCDSarG
 Email is hosted via Google Workspace Education. I have SPF, DMARC etc setup.
 Also, I&#x27;m not sure if this is relevant, but on MXToolbox I get these warnings: (only noticed just now, has been perfect last time I checked months ago)
 Status Warning smtp aspmx.l.google.com Reverse DNS does not match SMTP Banner information More Info

 Any help, as always, is very much appreciated. Thank you.

                              <span>Hello everyone. I&#x27;ve been a long time lurker of this sub for about 5+ years. I come to you all with a dilemma I am experiencing. Although I am sure many of you would not consider this to be a dilemma at all. 
 So let me start off by saying I was recently offered a position as a Systems Administrator for a medium sized business with about 100 - 200 employees. Prior to this my only experience was working at a PC and cell phone repair shop. I do have a bachelors in IT, A+, CCNA, SEC+, Project+, LPI Linux Essentials, AWS Cloud Certified and ITIL V4 certifications. But I have like literally 0 help desk experience.
 I don&#x27;t have much experience besides homelabs. I&#x27;ve never worked in an office IT setting. Frankly, I&#x27;m not even sure why they hired me. I have 0 terminal skills. I understand basic networking concepts and I can Google myself through most user-related issues. The pay is 70k in a medium-cost of living area.
 Am I being overpaid? I feel very guilty because my boss is the nicest boss I have ever worked for, and I almost feel like I am scamming them.

                              <span>I have a DTC4000 and HDP6600. We need to support both printers and the software also needs to support YMCKFO (Foil/UV) ribbon panels.
 Easy Badge requires &quot;Expert Edition&quot; just to support the Foil/UV portion... which is a $1000 more than their standard edition which does everything else we need.
 What do you guys use?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m currently testing AlwaysOn VPN to replace Directaccess.
 It&#x27;s working well, much much faster than DA.
 ​
 But I have a problem regarding migration in a real world scenario.
 when I deploy VPN configuration to a computer, the AOVPN goes up, and DirectAccess stop connecting (as the computer can join the NLS server)
 but as the DirectAccess GPO still applied, we have conflict with NRPT rules and some services doesn&#x27;t work
 I can&#x27;t exclude AOVPN device from DA Policy, because I&#x27;m not sure at which moment the device will get is AOVPN configuration up and running 
 If I remove immediatly, the computer will remove is DA configuration without having AOVPN configuration, and the user will loose corporate access
 Due to covid, we have a lot of remote user. and we don&#x27;t want to have users without connection, having to go to work to repair etc
 Have any of you performed migrations from DA to AOVPN without asking users to come back to the office to have their computer reconfigured by the IT department?

                              <span>I&#x27;m creating this thread to raise awareness on the potential chaos that&#x27;s about to be unleashed this upcoming Patch Tuesday, especially onto the poor souls who run Remote Desktop Services (RDS) on-prem.
 When applying Preview Update KB5017380 to Windows 10, Remote Desktop and RemoteApp connections will break as discovered by /u/geoholz 2 weeks ago. This particular issue was mostly documented on Windows 11&#x27;s latest 22H2 update but it&#x27;s also present on Windows 10.
 TLDR: Turning off UDP (see below) allowed the RemoteApp feeds to re-appear after a gpupdate &amp; reboot.
 Overview
 I noticed users who logged into newly provisioned Windows 10 machines did not receive the RemoteApp desktop feed (configured via GPO and the _msradc DNS TXT entry) like they normally did. Visiting the /RDWeb site worked…</span>

                              <span>Howdy folks,
 Hope this helps some people out who need it. I covered the full SC-900 - Microsoft Security, Compliance &amp; Identity Fundamentals course in one video, the editing for this nearly killed me, well not really, it was just a lot of work to make lol.
 Anyway the video is about almost 5 hours long since it covers the whole dang course obviously. With that said, if someone is looking for something specific in the course, it would take them forever to find it so I added a list in the video description with most of the main topics that are covered with time stamps next to each topic.
 The time stamps will make it quicker and easier for people to find what they are looking for if they don&#x27;t want to watch the whole thing and are just looking for something specific.
 I will be adding a extra video after the course which will have practice questions in it to help prepare for the exam. Now before anyone goes and asks, no, those practice questions are NOT the questions out of the actual official exam, those kinds of questions are against Microsoft&#x27;s rules and not allowed.
 The practice questions I make will however cover the same topics and measure you on the same skills so they are legal and allowed by Microsoft.
 As I said in the beginning, I hope this helps some of you out since I know what it&#x27;s like when your boss/company forces you to write an exam and not being able to find any study resources for it.
 Same can be said for folks who can&#x27;t afford to pay courses or who just can&#x27;t find anything online. This should plug that hole.
 Below is a short 4-5 min course intro video I made which explains the course. The full course will be in the playlist or you can just go look on the channel, whatever floats your boat:

 I am NOT looking for anything fancy. All faxes should go to one email address, and outgoing faxes don&#x27;t need to be supported at all. I can do unauthenticated direct send, or SMTP AUTH.
 If any simple freeware / open source solution exists, they are drowned out in search results by advertisements for subscription cloud-based multi-user smart fax systems with AI and all other buzzwords included. Does anyone know of a simple solution?

                              <span>I have a bunch of different SSL certs for different servers of the same internal AD domain. Example: server1.localdomain.com, server2.localdomain.com, server3.localdomain.com, etc. Some are domain controllers (LDAPS) and some are IIS webservers, among other things.
 I am thinking I should instead purchase a single wildcard certificate for use with all services on my localdomain.com domain. I just don&#x27;t know how that works from the server / CSR perspective. Like I can make a CSR from server1 but I would have to do the same on the others, but it would be the same certificate. 
 I&#x27;m just a little unclear on the best approach. I use DigiCert mainly for 99% of our certs.

 Justin from Blackpoint Cyber here!
 If you&#x27;re already a Blackpoint Cyber partner you should have gotten this (sorry for the double alert), but if you&#x27;re not we wanted to make sure it got out to everyone else!
 Blackpoint Cyber is actively monitoring a Fortinet vulnerability involving authentication bypass. Tracked as CVE-2022-40684, users of the following products are vulnerable to attacks:
  
FortiOS: From 7.0.0 to 7.0.6 and from 7.2.0 to 7.2.1
 FortiProxy: From 7.0.0 to 7.0.6 and 7.2.0
  
This vulnerability could lead to remote threat actors logging into unpatched devices and performing operations on the administrative interface via specially crafted HTTP or HTTPS requests.
 How to Mitigate:
 Fortinet released security patches on Thursday, October 6th, advising users to do the following:
  
Update vulnerable devices to FortiOS/FortiProxy versions 7.0.7 or 7.2.2., or
 Perform this workaround: Block remote attackers from bypassing authentication and logging into vulnerable FortiGate and FortiProxy deployments by limiting the IP addresses that can reach the administrative interface using a local-in-policy
  
Important: Blackpoint’s SOC has not seen any indicators of compromise in our partners’ environments.
 Blackpoint’s SOC will continue to actively monitor for any indicators of compromise associated with this vulnerability. We are confident that our experienced MDR analysts and technology will continue to protect your business and clients.
 Sincerely,
 Blackpoint Cyber

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Just looking for some advice on what to do. I&#x27;ll keep this short as I can. 
 I was asked to refresh our storage infrastructure earlier this year. So I gave all of the required information on % growth rates and forecast projects to the supplier who we get hardware from to spec out a new solution. The solution has run out of space only after 6 months of prod usage My boss is fuming and long story short we are buying more storage, however he has said I should have been more vigilant even though they were the ones who used the forecast data to build the under-spec solution and the costs will be coming out of my pay
 Obviously I can&#x27;t afford the cost of this and don&#x27;t believe I should be liable for the failed solution. Is there anything I can do or any recourse?

Some of the files can be archive but we are wondering about the best way to do it. We tought about doing subsite but does subsite files count add up to the site count. We also tought about doing a document center but read that it was depreciated. There is also the idee of creating more site! Any idea anyone?

 Maggie commands
 Analysis of the malware revealed that it disguises as an Extended Stored Procedure DLL (“sqlmaggieAntiVirus_64.dll”) that is digitally signed by DEEPSoft Co. Ltd, a company that appears to be based in South Korea.
 Extended Stored Procedure files extend the functionality of SQL queries by using an API that accepts remote user arguments and responds with unstructured data.
 Maggie abuses this technical behavior to enable remote backdoor access with a rich set of 51 commands.
 A report from DCSO CyTec says that the variety of commands supported by Maggie allow querying for system information, executing programs, interacting with files and folders, enabling remote desktop services (TermService), running a SOCKS5 proxy, and setting up port forwarding.
 The attackers can append arguments to these commands, and Maggie even offers usage instructions for the supported arguments in some cases.

 I sent this thread to a higher up on my team but the IT department is still investigating. Is it possible to find official announcements from BitDefender and/or Cisco to help end the investigation? Now our CIO is getting involved!
 I checked the news and the BitDefender blog but no mention of the problem or fix.

                              <span>Hello, 
 ​
 we have 2 domains each in their own location. There is a VPN connecting between both sites each domain with their own firewall, DNS and DHCP services. We would like to create a two-way trust relationship from Site A to Site B.
 ​
 Does anyone have the correct steps required to create a trust relationship? 
 ​
 My questions are :
 ​
 ​
 1- Here&#x27;s a shortlist of the minimum amount of ports: Am I Correct ?
 ​
 Port Protocol Service
 ​
 53 TCP/UDP DNS
 ​
 88 TCP/UDP Kerberos
 ​
 389 TCP/UDP LDAP
 ​
 445 TCP SMB
 ​
 636 TCP LDAP (SSL)
 ​
 ​
 ​
 2 - Do I have to create two-way tust between the PDC emulator in both domains ?
 ​
 ​
 ​
 My environment:
 ​
 COMPANY A : We have 4 DC &amp; DNS.
 ​
 DC1 is holding all FSMO roles.
 ​
 C:\Windows\system32&gt;netdom query fsmo
 Schema master dc1.contoso.local
 Domain naming master dc1.contoso.local
 PDC dc1.contoso.local
 RID pool manager dc1.contoso.local
 Infrastructure master dc1.contoso.local
 The command completed successfully.
 ​
 ​
 COMPANY B : We have 4 DC &amp; DNS.
 ​
 DC1 is holding all FSMO roles.
 ​
 C:\Windows\system32&gt;netdom query fsmo
 Schema master dc1.companyB.local
 Domain naming master dc1.companyB.local
 PDC dc1.companyB.local
 RID pool manager dc1.companyB.local
 Infrastructure master dc1.companyB.local
 The command completed successfully.
 ​
 ​
 Thank you

                              <span>Not all MFAs are equal!! As we know, we&#x27;re seeing a spike in multiple MFA attacks like MFA Fatigue on push notification authentication. With all these suspicious MFA attacks, it&#x27;s been hard to cope.
 Thankfully, Microsoft has finally understood our concerns and provided options to choose different MFA security levels for different users. You can find this newly released grant control &quot;require authentication strength in Microsoft conditional access.&quot; Navigate to the path below to find the newly released “require authentication strength” checkbox:
 Azure AD Admin Center --&gt; Azure Active Directory ---&gt; Security (Under Manage Tab) --&gt; Conditional Access.
  
Hereafter, you can opt to allow SMS for base-level workers and implement stronger phishing-resistant MFA for admin &amp; executive accounts.
  
Following a thorough analysis of all authentication methods, Microsoft has categorized three different authentication modes under the grant control. They are, 
  
Basic multi-factor authentication. 
 
Passwordless multi-factor authentication. 
 
Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication. 
  
Note: This is still in &quot;preview&quot; mode. Sadly, it won&#x27;t be available for everyone. Hope it will be rolled out for you soon if you don&#x27;t see it!

                              <span>(TL;DR in bold at the end of the post.)
 I just joined a company that has an IT department, but is not an IT company (banking sector). I&#x27;m the lead of a dozen of programmers/system engineers, and one of the particularity of that team is that more than half of the employees were already working there in the last millennium.
 I can see how some Agile/Kanban/Scrum concepts can help them to be more effective and working as a better team. But I don&#x27;t want to be that &quot;youngster that wants to change everything and introduce micromanagement&quot;. I&#x27;m walking on eggs, even if it&#x27;s a lot of self-inflicted pressure.
 What I don&#x27;t want or need is to implement a full Kanban/Scrum methodology, it just doesn&#x27;t fit the team, the spirit or the needs.
 What I want is:

                              <span>I have gone through the whole process to setup FIDO for my organization, the last remaining issue is I absolutely cannot get the workstations to display the security key option for authentication. Or any Windows Hello method for auth.
 I&#x27;ve set the GPO, windows deployment package, I even went through the hassle of adding my devices into intune and setting policy and enabling windows hello. I have all the options on the workstation in accounts after logging in, but cannot choose the method for authentication.
 Does anyone have suggestions? The troubleshooting flow in the KBs are quite worthless...

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking at replacing our backup infrastructure with something we can manage a bit easier, ideally with a central management gui for the less technically minded in our organisation.
 We exclusively use Linux, and don&#x27;t touch Windows so Veeam is unfortunately not an option. 
 Is there anything like this out there that can handle sending to S3 directly from each server? Everything I&#x27;ve found seems to be single server and either relies on mounting an S3 bucket as a disk or has no cloud based support at all.

                              <span>What could be going on here? Updates are set to download only, confirmed with sconfig, yet our servers will just go ahead and install updates and reboot on their own.
 In the updates screen, it shows &quot;Policies set on your device&quot; as &quot;Disable Automatic Updates&quot;
 Is there something I can check? Based on the event log, the update was installed yesterday sometime, though I can&#x27;t tell if the install was user initiated or not (if user initiated, then this makes sense).
 EDIT: Running wmic qfe list shows the update was installed by NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM (while I see updates I know were done manually show domain/username). So doesn&#x27;t seem user initiated. 
 How do I stop this behavior? This was running hyper-v workloads, and windows still decided to reboot.

I recently got stuck in a loaner car and have been forced to listen to fm radio for the first time in years and I keep hearing commercials to change careers into IT. Seems like a total scam to me from the commercials so I was wondering if anyone had actually meet someone who moved into the IT field after taking one of those “courses”?

 I am wanting to purchase a number of IT related books to further my development (mastering AD, mastering Powershell, MS100, etc) and thought it&#x27;s going to be cheaper long term to buy in kindle books however my concern is if these type of books have lots of diagrams and need to be in colour?
 Should I just get them as traditional books or is a kindle suitable?

One family I&#x27;m working with has a mother who has dementia. I&#x27;d like to be able to basically provide a tool that controls all ingress and egress emails and/or monitoring of all emails. We&#x27;re looking to solve the scam and spam problems that are especially exacerbated by people who don&#x27;t remember that they don&#x27;t remember things.
 Just looking for anything that is more personally licensed and incredibly easy to use (as I&#x27;d like to give access to the family).

                              <span>If you have several DNS-Servers in your environment with dedicated servers for internet-resolution and internal servers that forward the external queries to them, there should be no outgoing queries except for the internet-DNS systems. Or at least there should be a concept on how queries move through the network.
 Check your config, esp. regarding forwarding config or internal root-NS and then validate on the firewalls if there&#x27;s anything that shouldn&#x27;t be there. 
 We got urgent requests from some customers over the last months where the guys managing DNS got informed (or saw for themselves) that servers contact the internet root-NS that shouldn&#x27;t do that according to the config, and ofc their reaction covered the spectrum from &quot;btw guys, i found that in the firewall, is this normal?&quot; to &quot;OMG, DID WE GET COMPROMISED!? Please do the needful to mitigate and provide turnaround time for resolution!&quot;
 Turns out, the resolver (the OS-component, not a DNS-Server) on some linux systems regularly checks the Root-NS directly for the trust anchors. Not really critical and can be turned off with 2 commands.
 What i found strange is that it has been like that for several years and only a handful of customers was either paranoid, curious or bored enough to actually notice this so far. 
 So yeah...maybe look into that in advance if you have spare time before somethings pops up during an audit on the firewall and it becomes a high-prio issue.

                              <span>Hello,
 I have an strange issue since some time the windows network drives of all Windows10 Client PC´s are disconnecting one or two times a day in the branch offices. On my Servers I don´t have this issue. 
 At first I thought it is an network issue but the connection is fine.
 Does anybody has an tip what I could do? (If possible a tip or trick that can be published via GPO, but i am open for all suggestions!)
 ​
 Many thanks in advance!

 How does everyone else manage their corporate contacts centrally?

 the webdav site is reachable via a browser and all files are downloadable
 If I start our program (as administrator) the software connects to the webdav site and downloads the latest updates
 I need the updates (lot of folders and files) on a ssd but I cannot make a network connection in Windows 10 or use WinSCP to connect to the webdav site. It failes with authentication.. 403 error&gt;
 so.. http anonymous is ok.. with webdav client.. no go? why?
 and unfortunately.. we don&#x27;t know username and pass, the content is managed elsewhere

 How would this work server and network wise? 
 We use UPS with 30 mins power but would this mean everything needs to be switched off daily and manually back on?
 Do you guys have a contingency plan for this?

                              <span>Hi, everyone! Has anyone seen any issues with Windows 11 PCs in a domain environment? Got a handful of PCs that got upgraded to Windows 11 recently. Now they&#x27;re unable to access any file shares at all, get the message:
  
The system cannot contact a domain controller to service the authentication request. Please try again later.
  
Users can manually enter in their AD credentials, but it’s only a temporary solution. Using the IP for network share works without prompting for credentials, though.
 Uninstalled antivirus, reinstalled LAN adapter drivers, also updated them from manufacturer&#x27;s site. Installed all latest Windows updates. Disabled Windows firewall briefly, gave PC full internet access.
 nltest /sc_query:PCLAB.com (fake)
 Returns:
  
Flags: 30 HAS_IP HAS_TIMESERV Authentication Service: Netlogon 
 Trusted DC Name \\PCS1-001.PCLAB.COM 
 Trusted DC Connection Status Status &#x3D; 0 0x0 NERR_Success 
 The command completed successfully
  
​
 nltest /dclist:PCLAB.com
 Returns:
  
Cannot DsBind to PCLAB.COM (\\PCS1-001.PCLAB.COM).Status &#x3D; 2148074320 0x80090350 SEC_E_DOWNGRADE_DETECTED 
 I_NetGetDCList failed: Status &#x3D; 1231 0x4cf ERROR_NETWORK_UNREACHABLE
  
nslookup works without issues. Disabled IPv6 for ethernet connection, manually configured to use different DNS server IPs as well. Even tried &quot;netsh winsock reset&quot; command.
 I can ping our DC &amp; DNS IPs, disjoined/rejoined to domain without issues. Can recreate this on other Windows 11 PCs that were upgraded. Haven&#x27;t tried a completely fresh PC yet, though. This was all done on client PCs so far. Not seeing anything in Event Viewer application/server logs on DC servers.
 I&#x27;m about at the end of my rope and thinking we should just revert these PCs back to Windows 10. I&#x27;d appreciate any helpful advice.

                              <span>Ars Technica had a nice article about how most Big Tech operators just physically destroy media
 https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2022/10/why-big-tech-shreds-millions-of-storage-devices-it-could-reuse/?comments&#x3D;1
 They do mention some issues that have happened in the past when companies don&#x27;t wipe/destroy data properly, either cos they outsource it to people/companies that don&#x27;t do it properly or because someone got lazy, leading to fines and or lawsuits.
 I&#x27;ve wiped a few drives in my time working in tech and used them elsewhere in the company with an assurance the data is zeroed out but these have always been for internal use within the company. Looking around a bit I had a hard time finding guidance for a good methodology for erasing/wiping drives. Perhaps I&#x27;m looking for the wrong terms, or looking at the wrong sources.
 How do you guys do it? Any particular sources you trust that keep current with practices?

                              <span>There is a user who works off site behind a double NAT network. They routinely have issues being able to ping our local subnet which means they can&#x27;t get to a server they need. They never have issues establishing the tunnel so I don&#x27;t know why double NAT would come into play. I just noticed the issue while troubleshooting today. It feels more like an issue with their route table on Windows or a corrupted TCP/IP stack? Its weird because they are the only one having this issue as well. Im wondering if the VPN is getting confused, but as far as I know thats only inbound connections.
 Edit: I also want to add that nothing changes with the remote network that I know of and nothing with our local network. Its seemingly random when they can ping the server and when they cant. But, again, never an issue establishing the tunnel.

                              <span>Hello,
 We have 2 Ubiquity switches about 200 feet apart in a warehouse. I would like to run a fiber line between the two. I am planning on using the Ubiquity modules ( UACC-OM-MM-10G-D ) that are designed for MMfiber and 300m run.
 What optical cable should I buy and from where ( link please) ? What tools do I need?
 The warehouse varies from 45F to 110F degrees up by the roof. Can the fiber cable span hanging from hooks on the wall about 10ft spans with out damage?
 Thank you in advance:)

                              <span>I’m trying to understand why I’m encountering very different TCP throughput across similar routes.
  
Client A: Linux, Northern California, in datacenter (1gbps)
 Client B: MacOS, Northern California, residential (500mbps)
 Server A: Virgina, US (1gbps)
 Server B: London, UK (1gbps)
  
Latency is pretty similar between both clients and servers, but TCP throughput is wildly different:
  
  Server A (Virginia) Server B (London) 
  
 Client A 60ms, 400Mbits/sec 136ms, 180Mbits/sec 
  Client B 68ms, 15Mbits/sec 🔴 140ms, 120Mbits/sec 
 
 I uploaded the raw iperf3 output, as well as mtr reports to server a
 I&#x27;m trying to understand why the performance of Client B is so poor to Server A, yet is much better to Server B which is further away.
 What stands out to be from the iperf3 data is:
  
MUCH bigger Cwnd with Client A (6mb vs ~120kb)
 MUCH greater Retr count with Client B
  
Additional info about Client B:
  
Cloudflare speed test shows 550mbps.
 0% packet loss to Server A, reported via &#x60;ping -i 0.1 &#x60; for 60s.
  
​
 Any ideas on what might be happening, or how to debug this?

Not really sure what difference it makes but anyway: Is there any windows software that can show me more detailed info about my wireless connection? Looking to see bandwidth assigned for a given channel whether its 40 or 80mhz, and to see if its using any QAM modulation technique? I have a 2x2 wifi-5 interface, and assigned the ap to have 80mhz bandwidth on channel 42 (wifiman app says the bandwidth ranges from channels 34 to 50) but am only getting at most 300mbps. I believe it might be possible for this to be higher, if it were using QAM256, but I don&#x27;t know how to check this. There is minimal interference with any overlapping signal at -85dB. I am testing using iPerf3 between my laptop and a server. My network card is an intel ax201, and am connecting to a unifi AC Pro. Thanks!

                              <span>Hello,
 So recently, there has been packet drops on our network in both internal network and external. Whenever we are downloading a file, the speed will gradually slow down and eventually come to 0 kbps then say it has network issues and stop downloading.
 At first, we isolated the issue to be our ISP. And after some testing from them they said that their radio was misaligned causing the packet drops. They fixed the issue on their end. We tested this by just plugging a computer straight into the router and downloading the same file we&#x27;ve been using as a test. There was no issue with downloading.
 So we tested the download on an access switch and on WiFi to see if the issue lies within the internal network. I plugged a laptop straight into the core switch and tested the download. The issue…</span>

                              <span>I understand how it works, and why it&#x27;s important for stopping network loops. What I don&#x27;t really understand is why a link would become unidirectional in the first place, rather than simply stopping. An example I saw was a fibre pair, one for recieving and one for transmitting. However, my understanding is that if a core went down, the link would simply drop.
 Am I missing something more obvious, or is it only for special use cases?

                              <span>For all the Palo experts out there-
 If IPSec VPN tunneling is maintained and encryption algorithms are modified and applied on both sides, will traffic disruptions necessarily occur?
 Will it happen with other firewall vendors like checkpoint,Cisco asa, fortinet, etc as well? Since the working of firewalls are very similar for the most part which is why I asked.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Whats your understanding between normal NAT vs CGNAT? 
 I&#x27;ve worked for small ISPs and all we do is just masquerade list of CGNAT range to a public IP. Example 100.64.0.0/24 to public IP x.x.x.x.
 Whats the difference between the two? How are you configuring CGNAT?
 I came across a comment saying that on CGNAT, we can limit the NAT entries for a user, or even session. I wonder if thats the only difference between the two, whereas normal NAT / masquerade doesnt limit the NAT entries and router will keep on NATting until it ran out of ports.
 When I say normal NAT, in Cisco command: ip nat inside source  pool xyz overload

 So captured some packets turns out it is coming from source port 3842( radius) to destination port 1812, Under application data is was seeing following information:
 Code: access-request Avp-- username:abaws User-password : encrypted
 Framed IP-address: 20.87.27.181 Calling station Id (31) l&#x3D;14 Val &#x3D; 20.87.27.181 ( Microsoft ip! For some reason)
 Acct-session-id &#x3D; 5eb714bb
 Connect-info : VPN-ssl ( very interesting) Vendor I&#x27;d: fortinet (12356)
 Is it normal or does it change for different vendors? Why Microsoft ip is in the captures?

 I have a good networking team with a couple of CCIE&#x27;s and they need some help scanning the market and thinking through a large scale refresh at 200+ locations. We want to modernize and simplify while future-proofing a bit. 
 I know that every VAR, and their great-great-great -grandmother&#x27;s cat, swears they can do it. I&#x27;m not looking for some fancy titles at a var that can interface with major vendors to draw diagrams to give me a BOM - although I will need that eventually. Also not looking for an MSP that can &quot;just do everything for you!&quot;.

 I just wanted to confirm that this range is indeed not public, and in that sense, similar to a range like 10.0.0.0/8.

                              <span>Hi,
 Stupid question here and Cisco hasn&#x27;t given me a good answer yet. We&#x27;re working on migrating about 2000 access points off a Cisco 8540 to a Cisco 9800. We&#x27;ve been using the CSV tool within the Configuration piece in the GUI and importing static tags with the format , 
, , . After we upload the CSV and point the APs to the 9800, they come up perfectly as designed.
 ​
 As we look to move wider chunks of APs, I want to make sure this work is done in advance of moving the APs. Cisco has said there is no way to dump all this IF the AP is not actively on the controller. This doesn&#x27;t sound right since it&#x27;s stored somewhere in the controller for when the AP does eventually join. Does anyone know of a way via CLI/GUI/API to dump these &quot;staged&quot; static tags?
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>I have a hypervisor which created two bridges xbr-1 and xbr-2, also 10 interfaces on each x-etap-01, etc.
 My goal is to isolate VMs from each other (x-etap-01, x-etap-02, etc) and prohibit access to other devices on the host, just access to Internet, nothing else on the local. 
 One, addition is that these VMs open ports &#x27;port-number&#x27;+id which I need to access from the host, so only one way access to the VMs. 
 Is it possible to do it and is so, I would appreciate directions I should take.
 btw, as you can see, I&#x27;m not good at networking

                              <span>We use the get-console airconsole mini with extensions at our company. But lately we had problems with failures as well as the expandability of the devices. Also I think that the quality of the devices has decreased over the last years.
 What kind of console servers do you use and which ones would you recommend? On the one hand those in small form factor like the airconsole mini but also for rack mounting.

                              <span>Suppose you have a piece of testing equipment with two SFP+ ports and your router/switch has 24 SFP+ ports.
 Do you have any idea to test all switch/router ports at the same time just with two testing ports? I want to ensure that the device can do 240 Gbps switching without any problem.
 My idea is to configure each pair of ports in a separate VLAN and connect each VLAN to the next VLAN by connecting one port of the VLAN&#x27;s pair to one of the ports on the next VLAN. The first port and last port of the device are connected to the testing ports.

                              <span>Two devices on the same wifi network can have the same public IP address. So when the router receives a packet, it has to translate the destination public IP address to the private IP of the intended device. This means NAT can only use the port numbers to identify a device on a local network, as well as which port of that device to send the packet to.
 Does this practice reduce the number of available ports that all of the devices combined can use at a time? Because each device can have a maximum of 65,536 ports and for multiple devices, the total number of ports increases with each new device, but the router can support a maximum of 65,536 ports itself.

                              <span>I got called into a project to install a wireless Point to Point between two buildings at a client. The buildings have fiber, but they want a redundant link to avoid downtime. Apparently there&#x27;s some upcoming construction and the boss is worried the fiber may get accidentally get cut in construction. 
 I&#x27;ve installed the Ubiquiti Power beam on each building and connected each end to a Cisco switch. I am using the PoE injectors. 
 In the testing phase, the PtP is working fine. The warehouse end comes out of a trunk port on the Cisco Switch, go through a PoE injector, then wireless goes across the parking lot to the admin building and then comes through another PoE injector. 
 If you plug a laptop straight to the injector, it joins you to the LAN. If you put an unmanaged switch on the injector, and then plug in, you&#x27;re on the LAN. 
 But if you run the injector into the second switch, it doesn&#x27;t go anywhere. The CLI doesn&#x27;t even show the port (port 2) as active. 
 What am I missing? I have full access to the switches, but I don&#x27;t really have a good background of Cisco Training.
 Ideally, I&#x27;d like both links to be active, so if the fiber broke, the PtP would keep everything online, and I believe STP would prevent a loop, if activated. 
 If all else fails, it&#x27;s fine if the PtP stays unplugged from the switch until actually needed. 
 I&#x27;ve tested it both with the fiber plugged and unplugged, and it does not make a difference.

 It seems companies and tech vendors are being attacked with increased sophistication and they are covering up or downplaying security breaches with hippo sized lies with increased frequency.

                              <span>I need to replace an aging QNAP NAS. The file system has grown, currently growing over 1TB / yr. The NAS has 18TB of space and using 14TB. It had a Gigabit network which would be a disaster to restore. 
 I have an offsite backup server running freenas on a Supermicro 36 bay chassis. I love the snapshotting of ZFS and its ability for differential offsite snapshots but not sure I want to use Supermicro for my production system as there is not a lot of part’s available in Canada. I’d prefer Dell, but then I’d need to go with a storage array attached to a server which isn’t as simple for shutting down power as a 36 bay chassis. Or I could get a new rack mount NAS from QNAP or Synology with a 10Gbe NIC but then I don’t get ZFS and am stuck with the NAS OS which isn’t the end of the world.

                              <span>Hey Everyone,
 Been a long time lurker on this subreddit and figured I&#x27;d create a post to get some help with challenges that myself and the rest of my teammates are experiencing. Was hoping that others out there might have some experience with lab management and can recommend some best practices to implement (tools, processes, technologies, anything really that could improve our lab environment).
 My team wants to make improvements in the lab and we are frequently asked by management what we would need to make it happen. Unfortunately, everyone currently working in the lab has really only experienced this lab environment and aren&#x27;t aware of other technologies or improvements that could be made to run things a little more efficiently.
 First, let me paint a vivid picture of our current lab …</span>

 It&#x27;s entirely possible I&#x27;m just too damn old and don&#x27;t keep up with what the cool kids are calling things.
 Here&#x27;s the context (from my sister):
  
One of our systems keeps throwing out an internal server error and to fix it, IT said they &quot;rippled the servers&quot;
  
That sounds like rolling reboots of a server cluster/farm? Maybe?

                              <span>Howdy fellow sysadmins! I do some pro-bono consultation work for a small company (15 employees). They don&#x27;t have significant financial resources, but they&#x27;re cresting the amount of &quot;random&quot; systems that I can support without some management capability. 
 Setting up an entire active directory domain is extremely cost-prohibitive for them, so I&#x27;m looking for solutions. They already have a new Synology NAS, and it appears that Synology&#x27;s offering for their Directory Server is pretty alright for what I think I need.
 I&#x27;m looking for a way to standardize accounts &amp; permissions across their workstations, as well as a way to push group policies to the machines. It looks on the surface that all of this is supported. 
 They currently use a paid Google service for all their email, etc. but I&#x27;ve also thought of Microsoft 365 for them if the juice is worth the squeeze. From what I&#x27;ve been reading, they&#x27;d be paying the same price, but I would get all the added benefit of AD features (not all, but the critical ones).
 So, my question is this... 
  
Does anyone here have any experience using Synology&#x27;s DS offering?
 
What are you using for secondary DNS? I know the primary DNS is recommended to be run on the Synology along with the DS. 
 Currently DNS is on their pfsense, but I wouldn&#x27;t mind turning that into the secondary if it would support all the weird things needed for DS to work correctly.
 
 Has anyone use the Microsoft 365 offering? Is that worth checking out? How does it handle Group Policy, etc.
  
I&#x27;m sure this conversation will evolve, but I&#x27;d love to hear folks impressions.
 Full disclosure: For my background, I spent 10 years as a Windows System admin from 2000-2010 and am very comfortable in that environment. I then switched careers into Cyber and now focus on OT, so I&#x27;ve been Linux focused for the last 12 or so. Extremely comfortable in both environments and have been running Linux workstations and servers for 20 years.

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious to hear about others solutions for managing assets aside from the standard laptop and cell phone. I&#x27;m talking about printers, monitors, docking stations and any other semi-expensive tech one might deploy. Do you simply slap some type of asset tag on those device? I know there is countless asset management systems, but what about the smaller businesses? Typically, they are understaffed in IT as it is, and hardly pay for the necessities let alone an asset management system. I know there are free options out there, but I can&#x27;t vouch for helpful those might be. Aside from that, we still have to rely on other people to physically return or ship these devices back, at least this is the case in my role. That&#x27;s the part I hate, depending on someone else to do their job. How the hell do you make sure so and so returns all the equipment they should have in possession at the end of their employment? I mean printers and monitors don&#x27;t exactly go back into their boxes nice and neatly if they still even have them. I sure as hell can&#x27;t depend on an end user to pack things up nice and safely. What about disgruntled terminated employees? They obviously are bitter and are less cooperative. Do you have to get company council involved for them? 
 I know this turned more into a rant as I went on. I just am tired of that sense of searching for needles in a haystack and pulling teeth trying to keep up with tracking tech all over the county.

                              <span>Hey all,
 I’m trying to navigate the world of ruggedized laptops. At the moment my company continues to deploy refurbished Panasonic tough books, and while they’ve been somewhat reliable the fact is that most of these devices are 9 to 11 years old. Even replacing the HDD for a SSD is starting to become problematic as other components of these devices are continuing to fail. Third generation i5’s that have been heavily used aren’t having much fun anymore and I’m not having much fun supporting them at this point. 
 If you currently deploy laptops of these nature, then what is your go to? I know we’re currently paying ~$800 a piece for these older CF-53 laptops from a private refurbisher. There’s been discussion about going back to “standard” laptops for these guys as they aren’t exactly roughing it in the backwoods but I want to present a more current option for a rugged device if possible. Please note that I know they would be perfectly okay with refurbished devices if that isn’t obvious enough.

                              <span>My company got hit with the bad Bitdefender update today that interrupted our internet browsing. I was wondering what steps people took today to figure out the issue? I switched to our backup internet connection which didn&#x27;t help, ran a tracert and saw that it was hanging on the second hop, then checked downdetector and saw that whatever the issue was, it hit google, aws, and azure. I didn&#x27;t find out what the issue was until I hopped on reddit after the problem resolved itself. What did you do to troubleshoot the issue?

I get very little spam because of fairly aggressive filtering + SpamAssassin on my server. The only things that seem to get through are the damn spams from GMail addresses.
 This last one was for a &quot;Greek Sqaud&quot; renewal that was an image with no text other than &quot;HELLO USER&quot;. Complaints fall into a black hole, but they&#x27;re never from the same address twice, so even if Google did block the user, they&#x27;re just back using ImaDickweed298 instead of ImaDickweed297.
 There are only a handful of domains that I can&#x27;t consider putting a blanket ban on, and they&#x27;re one.

                              <span>We have a email filter to block/quarantine all the obvious spam &amp; malicious intent emails but curious what everybody else does for spoofed emails? So, the sender is using Gmail for example but lists their name as someone in the company usually an exec&#x27;s name or as a service such as &quot;IT Admin&quot;. 
 Right now I prepend the emails Subject line with &quot;**** WARNING ****&quot; and also include a large yellow box in the message body that says in so many words Caution, External Sender , Fake, Stranger Danger, etc. 
 I understand how a person might breeze past the subject line but the yellow box cannot be missed. At least that&#x27;s what I thought. I still get folks contacting me asking if emails are legit or not. Their email includes the two prepended warnings but they are still unsure. I am happy everyone is being safe but I thought the warnings make it obvious.
 Again, curious what other people&#x27;s strategies are for spoofed emails and warning the user base.
 (I would prefer to block them outright but, numerous Execs use personal gmail, yahoo, outlook etc. to email themselves)

                              <span>Hello everyone. Just had users complaining that &quot;the internet is down&quot;. Usually, I may roll my eyes and then get over myself but this time it was network wide. Rebooted switch stack, checked FW, no change/apparent issues. 20 minutes later everything seems ok, checked downdetector. Sure enough a spike in reports for Google, OpenDNS, AWS, and CloudFlare.
 ​
 Has anyone else had issues as of ~12PM EST?

 March 9th 2021 Update (printing BSOD)
 March 15th 2021 Out-of-band Fix
 If I delay the update by 7 days, does the OOB get delayed as well? How can I manage something like this?

                              <span>So I finally have a rant to put forth here...
 Anyone that charges for SSO on their platform is pure BS. We have &quot;Cadillac services&quot; that support it out of the box with no additional &quot;enterprise&quot; licensing scheme. We have products that aren&#x27;t &quot;tier 1&quot; ranked that support it out of the box.
 And hell we even have Oracle products that support it out of the box... (I mean these are the guys with &quot;If you choose to have a firewall in your organization.&quot; in their documentation)
 In my odyssey to centralize authentication these companies have now made the shit list... And the ones that got the balls to charge per user per month... (Keep in mind these aren&#x27;t the SP)
 Notably you Atlassian, Docusign, teamviewer.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I have a issue that i can’t seem to solve:
 I have a WDS server running, make boot images and install images. Now i want them to run unattended, i made a answer file and attached it to my test image. But when i PXE boot and select my boot image there is no sign that i uses the unattended file and makes me go through the full setup.
 What could be the issue?
 It should just connect to the server, sign in and run through the setup by itself.
 It seems that the boot image is not using the unattended file.
 Thanks in advance for any help given 😊

                              <span>We are currently using an old WDS server that is close to EOL. I am looking for a solution to caputre an image of a PC (Win10 and Win11), and then deploy it to approximately 100/mo. 
 I know MDT/WDS can handle this but I am looking for other options that might be quicker to set up and use. Any thoughts or recommendations?

                              <span>I just noticed that newly created shared mailboxes in M365/EXO are enabled by default. This was not always the default behaviour, they have previously been created as disabled. I also found old forum posts, that confirm this.
 When was this changed? Did I miss the announcement or was this silently changed? Why was it changed?

                              <span>So let me start off by saying that I recently started a new job, where I&#x27;m trying to implement MDT for imaging. I came from a position where I was using SCCM for imaging, so I&#x27;m familiar with Task Sequences, but I&#x27;m familiar with SCCM TS, which are a bit different from the MDT. (SCCM provides more options in the TS - More steps that aren&#x27;t available in vanilla MDT)
 That being said, I&#x27;ve got my TS to install the Operating System, but it won&#x27;t install applications. If I try to install applications without rebooting, it says that it can&#x27;t install applications from WinPE, so it&#x27;s going to reboot. Then it reboots and never finishes the TS.
 From doing some Google searching, it seems that it&#x27;s the WinRE that performs this step. However, I can&#x27;t get my TS to boot into WinRE to do that step. When I do the reboot step, it reboots into the main Windows OS, and just finishes the windows setup. The steps after that reboot never run. What am I doing wrong? How can I get it to reboot and still finish the task sequence?

                              <span>Seems multiple businesses, schools, etc, have been hit with ransomware near us lately. Each one I&#x27;ve heard of, their vm&#x27;s got encrypted along with backups. Some, their network was taken down completely as well. I&#x27;ve seen some quick dirty lists of controls to implement for this but damn it stresses me out because some of those with seemingly everything in place, still get hit. The fact that I would be at the office 24/7 rebuilding basically everything if that were to happen. Even if you have backups that don&#x27;t get hit, restoring everything and making sure its clean would be a nightmare in itself.
 It&#x27;s literally the only &quot;stressor&quot; in my role, wondering if/when you&#x27;ll get hit and what that will be like... How do you push that out of your mind?

                              <span>Facilities keeps contacting IT about trouble alarms going off multiple times in a day with no fire alarm actually going off. This is happening in many locations across campus but I am able to put a tone on the line and receive it at the opposite end. 
 I am under the impression that if I get a tone, the line is working as intended. Could there still be an issue that IT could fix even if I am getting my tone to traverse the whole line? These lines have been underground for about 50 years now so I am assuming it is normal wear and tear issues but I have to meet with the head of facilities to explain that to him and I&#x27;m not sure how to put it.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I’ve been given a task to find suitable governance tools for MS Teams, that can enforce some simple governance tools across a few thousand teams.
 The basics: - we want to see orphaned Teams and be able to quickly delete them
  
we want to force all current and future Teams to have at least 2 owners (so the specific departments themselves prevent orphaning their teams)
  
Does anyone know of a tool like that? We’re a very cybersecurity-minded org, with all our eggs in the MS basket, so we definitely need it securely integrate with MS.
 What solutions are you guys using? Do you think it would be better to just enforce it with PowerShell and angry emails?

                              <span>Updated my admin PC to 22H2 yesterday. Everything went mostly fine after I stopped trying to use Windows update to do the update. When the machine boots up I am greeted by a &quot;Program Compatibility assistant&quot; warning saying that the driver iqvw64e.sys is vulnerable and that it cannot load.
 I looked it up and that looks like this bug: https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/security-center/advisory/intel-sa-00051.html
 So I went and installed this:
 https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/15084/intel-ethernet-adapter-complete-driver-pack.html
 And when I reboot it is still telling me that the file is vulnerable.
 I noticed that when I installed the update from Intel the driver never changed at all, there are 4 copies of it on this system and they are all this file:
 05/22/2019 02:57 AM 58,304 iqvw64e.sys
 Is anyone aware if it is possible to correct this?

 Today, as I was going through yet another job interview I stumbled on this one recruiter who seemed like he had no interest in partaking this interview. The interview was done through Teams, and throughout the entire time he seemed like he was wandering off, focused on something else, picking his teeth. The entire interview took 5 minutes exactly.
 It started off with him asking me about my background, which I provided and quickly moved to the so called &quot;technical questions&quot;. Naturally, as with all tests, I get extremely nervous and mentally prepare to go into as much as detail as I can.

 ​
 i´ve got some kind of bug here. Maybe brainbug but we will see...
 I´ve got an nps that is also running dom CA. MsChapv2 is working as expected for vpn connections. All connections are logged. (failed and accepted)
 I will have to add another Policy for 802.1x wifi. If I disable PEAP as auth source and instead configure MsChap or anything else, I will have log entries with an unsupported auth. method. If I enable PEAP with any cert (Client/Server/IAS RAS) there are no eventlogs for this policy. The wifi itself will timeout on the radius request. BUT i have eventlogs in my C:\Windows\System32\LogFiles\INxxxx.log no error:

 I didn&#x27;t go too deep and found GenieACS as a free open-source option.
 Does anyone have experience using it and know if it&#x27;s good or there are any other options?
 I see that the software has regular updates, i will set up a VM and try test with some routers before deploy to end-users...

 We have tried: 
  
Openoffice apps for linux (none of them are good enough)
 
Office 365 in browser (not good enough)
 
A VM for each user with Office 365 installed (abandoned because of extreme resource use)
 
An RDS server with Office 365 (haven&#x27;t tried, but apparently is very resource expensive as well)

 What kind of shelving/cabinets/storage set up do you have for your spare parts in the data center? I have a few Bakers shelves and some miscellaneous totes. However, it has now ended up where I have stuff laying around all over the place on the floor in different cages because there’s not enough shelving and no real system. 
 Wondering what you all do, and if you’d be willing to share some pictures of your set up. I would really like to do better.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I’m looking for a platform that will update the warranty status of our endpoints (we use major manufacturers like MS, Dell, Lenovo, and Apple). We currently use Solarwinds Service Desk, which is fine, but won’t give us warranty information unless that info is already on the device, so it’s hit or miss. I’m looking for something that will pull the warranty status from the manufacturer for the most up to date information.
 Please let me know if you have any recommendations, thank you!

                              <span>I’m a catch-all IT manager and the latest thing to fall on my lap is joining an international office to our UK-based domain. We have a handful of staff abroad and we want to get their computers fully corporate/policy/etc.
 I don’t know where to begin as networking is my least strongest subject within my many, many hats.
 Right now those in the international office will VPN in to access network resources. But this is just like “working from home”.
 What I want is a second AD DS server over there which will act as a backup DC and allow “local” authentication, etc. Corporate laptops will therefore always be domain joined.
 Where do I begin?
 My research says something like purchasing: a router/firewall, a switch, a windows server, then the various cabling/infrastructure and probably an Aruba Instant-on AP for wireless.
 Do I configure the windows server to VPN on over to our domain? 
 I’m getting a flight over and buying a Netgate 4100 running Pfsense. Do I configure the VPN there?
 I appreciate this is a big question and a big can of worms, and I can see why people might suggest employing a 3rd party network specialist to sort it over there, but I reckon getting over the domain join hurdle and setting up the firewall are the 2 only obstacles I have.
 Any thoughts greatly appreciated – thanks from an overworked, overhatted, accidental sysadmin.

                              <span>I set this policy in my test lab &quot;CA10 block access for unknown or unsupported apps&quot; but it&#x27;s somehow not excluded the admin and now I&#x27;m locked out.
 Confused as tried logging in on a device that is enrolled into intune and in the Edge browser signed in but still won&#x27;t let me in? Surely this should work as enrolled?
 Just wondering how to get back in without contacting MS. I have a few devices enrolled but none let the admin login.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m using these 2 commands to copy data from an old file server to a new one.
 First: (copies all and the permissions)
 ROBOCOPY &quot;\\oldserver\folder1&quot; &quot;G:\folder1&quot; /E /ZB /XD DfsrPrivate /PURGE /COPYALL /R:0 /NP /tee 
 Second: (hopefully just changes)
 ROBOCOPY &quot;\\oldserver\folder1&quot; &quot;G:\newserver&quot; /mir /R:0 /np 
 The second 1 can take just as long to run/finish. The folder is about 1TB.
 Is that about normal in terms of time. Bother servers are VMs on the same 10GB network. CPU/Mem all seem low too.

                              <span>We are having a slight issue when trying to detect new doors/ACUs in our Net2 server config.
 We have a Net2 server/setup located in one office and a number of doors/ACUs connected to it locally, but we are now in the process of setting 5 doors/ACUs in a remote office – we have the network configuration in place and from the server that is hosting our Net2 server I can ping the remote office ACUs by the IP addresses they have been assigned (this only proves ICMP but I all add more on)
 The issue I note is that when I try to detect doors with the detect button I am not seeing any new doors appear in the list, however if I try to manually add one of the ACUs/Doors by MAC it lets me but when entering the IP it gives me an error/status that the IP is already in use by a device with the same MAC address
 I am not sure what exactly could be the issue here but I have noted it does get added into the Net2 Access Control tool so we can somewhat configure and use it.
 The issue is that it is not working fully as expected with the error/notice above, is there anything major we could be missing?
 To me it looks like the door is being seen by our server but not detected correctly.
 Anyone has experience with this?

                              <span>Long story short, I changed jobs few months ago. For documentation I left following 1) Actual documentation and password for everything 2) Video training how to do specific stuff, mostly how to keep infrastructure running, intended for even non technical person to do stuff.
 Now here&#x27;s the fun part, New guy comes around and starts blaming me for stuff, by stuff I mean everything Some DHCP/DNS issue arose and he started manually setting static IP for users which caused issues itself, He doesn&#x27;t have any experience with Unix so logs in as root to the critical server and he accidentally deletes cron jobs He doesn&#x27;t have any experience with AD and randomly messes with stuff which causes issues and other stuff I won&#x27;t mention ALL of this gets blamed on me and with reason - &quot;He didn&#x27;t left enough info&quot;
 He doesn&#x27;t message me directly to ask for stuff(He only messages when he can&#x27;t fix something and wants help which I am no longer providing) During office working hours whenever something breaks and he can&#x27;t fix it - Old guys fault, no idea what to do.
 now normally I wouldn&#x27;t care, but I have tons of non technical colleagues there and it&#x27;s my reputation on line, should I get in touch with ex boss and inform him about this stuff?

                              <span>Hello! 
 Maybe someone here can give me some new ideas...
 We have 14 devices (mostly Dell laptops, different models, and one Surface Pro) with this issue. The screen locks after 5 min regardless of power/screensaver settings.
 Some devices are running win10 others win11.
 Troubleshooting steps tried:
 - Restore power settings to default
 - Assign a different power plan
 - Modified screensaver settings or disable screensaver
 - Local Policies &gt; Security Options &gt; “Interactive Logon: Machine inactivity limit” set it to 900 seconds or more...
 - HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Power\PowerSettings\238C9FA8-0AAD-41ED-83F4-97BE242C8F20\7bc4a2f9-d8fc-4469-b07b-33eb785aaca0 -&gt; set attributes to 2 and then modify system unattended sleep timeout option to 30 min or whatever number above 5.
 - Checked dell optimizer proximity sensor 
 - Run power troubleshooter
 - Uninstall recent windows updates
 - All Dell updates for device are done
 Any other ideas?

 Hi, i noticed the application you installed has a login page on a webserver that&#x27;s not in https. I can provide you with the necessary certificates from our Enterprise CA.
 Vendor:
 I&#x27;m sorry, current version of our web interface does not support https. Why do you need https? It&#x27;s an internal network, not the internet.

                              <span>I currently have a server with a ryzen 3800x, 64gb ram and 30TB of Raid-z1 HDD storage. I looked into creating a VPS company (https://zermous.com), however with further research I could have to pay lots of money for a colocation to support allocating external IPV4 addresses. I am able to now via routing wireguard from other VPS to the one I create, however I cannot automate this, even with programs such as ansible. I was also looking into cloud storage solutions, however there really isn&#x27;t any pre-made solutions. 
 I don&#x27;t have the time nor money to be constantly working on this project due to university and my job so I was hoping there was another solution to make some money off this because I don&#x27;t personally need it.
 Thank you for any answers/replies.
 TLDR; 
 I have a server that I don&#x27;t know what to do with.

                              <span>Hi all,
 tldr: Got computers getting DHCP leases from the wrong VLAN
 Got a weird issue. At my current $job we have multiple VLANs for various systems, the basic network is CLIENT (untagged) --&gt; Cisco Phone (Tagged) --&gt; Meraki/Netgear Switch --&gt; Cisco Nexus --&gt; Router (VyOS) --&gt; HyperFlex + Vmware --&gt; Windows Server 2019 with DHCP (in fail over) + MDT Server.
 The VyOS router has DHCP relay listeners on all the client networks to route them to the Windows servers for DHCP (or MDT).
 Now the issue is VLAN 1 (as the default) is only used for network management, everything else is on their own VLANs.
 100 - VoIP / 200-202 - Client / 300 - Servers
 So the issue is, some PCs (Dell desktops) or laptops (Dell Laptop + Dock OR Lenovo Laptop + Dock) picks up a DHCP offer from the wrong network. Some times it could be on the old client VLAN or currently it&#x27;s attempting to bind to VLAN 1&#x27;s range.
 Most of the PCs, if we get Windows (10 or 11) to do a network reset (or manually do netsh winsock reset &amp; netsh ip int reset), the system comes good.
 Notes
  
Statically setting the IP address, allows the computer to work on the correct VLAN
 The computer gets the IP but fails to release OR communicate with anything (IE if it&#x27;s on the wrong VLAN)
 All the DHCP is running from 2 servers in a failover configuration under M$ on Windows
 The computers are either freshly built or been running for about 3-9 months
 Everything is updated to the latest versions (as per M$ for Windows, Dell/Lenovo for drivers, Cisco/Netgear for switches, VyOS for router)
 Each port is configured for the native VLAN to be the correct client VLAN + the VoIP VLAN being tagged for the phones.

 I know it doing a DB clean up but is it normal to see DNS update Failed (Error 31) (DNSRegError 2) for each IP before it attempts to renew ??

                              <span>So I&#x27;m helping to rewrite our job descriptiona. We&#x27;re a small shop with three guys (sysadmin, help desk/desktop, me/dev). The current sysadmin is leaving but had done a lot of security functions as well. Is there a generally acceptable title for a combined role like this? I know the general answer would be to have them separate but we don&#x27;t have enough going on for two positions where now we have one. I do part of the sysadmin work as well as part of my functions so... Yay?

                              <span>Recently we&#x27;ve been increasing security on some of our important domain accounts, mainly privileged dev &amp; sysadmin users. Adding them to the Protected Users group was one of those measures.
 Ever since, we&#x27;re not able to authenticate to our SQL Server using these accounts, neither using Windows Authentication nor SQL Server Authentication. Removing the protected users group completely removes the problem. We&#x27;re aware this is due to the data not being stored in the local cache which is used in the authentication process.
 I wonder if there are workarounds, or if there&#x27;s similar security features which would not break our authentication.

I have an Heath problem That provoques a crisis and sometime a septicemia each time: Now i can&#x27;t even say That i am sick or this Will increase the likehod PF being also fired. They Will eventually find some disonest outsoucing company with a lower prive than mu salary with a inexperience guy from abroad. I fell sick bu i cannot be sick Sorry for the rant and bad English: i am now with fever

 I&#x27;ve got it exactly the same way two other c9300&#x27;s are connected, and booted. 
 What would cause this not to power up?

                              <span>I’m trying to implement MAB on a server farm switch. I did a show mac address-table and got the list of MAC addresses that were listed on all the ports, I then fed them into the MAB policy in ISE and successfully was able to MAB the hyper v port but almost all the ports went down and didn’t come back up once I applied MAB and bounced the port and one of them the minute I added the port that was the physical host in the server it went down and would not come back up until I removed all the authentication and tagged it directly into the vlan again with a “switchport access vlan xxx”command. In the end 99% of the ports either wouldn’t come up the minute I applied MAB to the port or went down when I applied MAB to some other port. I can’t imagine it’s not possible to MAB virtual servers and I must just be missing something. 
 Any advice would be appreciated

 I am planning to use soft-roce on my VM. I want to use RoCE version 2 on my physical server. 
 Q. is this possible with ibverbs API ?
 Q. is this possible to use V2 of RoCE without using the mellanox ofed driver on the physical server? as ethernet and ROCE can&#x27;t co-exist on the same server and I still want my LAN to be up on my cluster, but just use RoCE for my client-server application.
 Any help would be appreciated, as I&#x27;m a bit stuck, thank you so much!

                              <span>I&#x27;m not entirely understanding what the best practice is for managing VLANs, subnets, and broadcast domains is when designing an enterprise LAN. 
 Here&#x27;s a basic LAN segment to reference throughout this post.
 Across an organization, let&#x27;s assume that at that a small size site with a single switch has VLAN 69 specified for interfaces connecting to PCs. 
 At a larger site, there will be multiple switches connecting to a central core switch (or switch cluster), which then connected upstream to a router (router-on-a-stick). If I deploy VLAN 69 on both of the access switches, despite them being in different subnets, the trunk links connecting the access switches to the core switch will expand my broadcast domain to include both of these networks. The L3 traffic will be contained to whatever the mask is set to (in this case, the two /24s as shown in the diagram), but the L2 traffic will include all three switches and the LAN-facing router interface. 
 Q: Is it possible to keep the broadcast domain limited to the scope of only the respective /24 networks without having to specify two separate VLAN IDs, or do I have to make one of the switches operate on a different VLAN ID? 
 If separate VLAN IDs are required, how do you best design your VLAN deployments? Do you have ranges of VLAN IDs for specific purposes (i.e. VLAN 60-69 for PCs, VLAN 70-79 for Servers, etc.)?

 Does anyone know what the comparison would be for Nokia&#x27;s NOKIA 7250 IXR-E in a VSR enviroment and the equivalent of the HUAWEI CX600-M2K as a virtual router? I have a client that wants the capabilities of those devices but on the software version. Any leads on dealers?
 TIA.

                              <span>I have a lecture hall with six Cisco 3602 APs. I counted 115 clients during today&#x27;s class session with 90% of them on the 5GHz band. The students and professor are complaining about the wifi. 
 The distribution of clients heavily favors 2 APs. One 5Ghz radio had 35; the other had 30. Other APs in the area had 0-10 clients. I have tried adjusting the power levels and will do further tests to try to determine why so many APs are favoring 1-2 5GHz radios when there are 4+ more to choose from in the immediate area. 
 This lecture hall has tables for each row so the clients aren&#x27;t as densely packed as you&#x27;re imagining and the APs are evenly distributed overhead. The only way to fit ~100 people in this room is to have an even distribution of bodies in seats. I think that rules out favoring 1-2 radios based on proximity. But I&#x27;m no expert
 Load balancing is not enabled on the controller. Does anyone have experience with this feature? I can&#x27;t find much information on it aside from Cisco saying it will totally work. 
 We do have band-select enabled and that appears to be working. The controller is a 5508 running 8.5.171.0

                              <span>So I know what the MPLS technology does. But say a business has an MPLS circuit. I work in a NOC where the majority of clients are SDWAN clients using a vmware veocloud. We always have to ask the customers to perform layer 1.
 So where does an MPLS circuit plug into, just a regular ATT modem and to the velocloud? Or is there something I&#x27;m not understanding. I&#x27;ve heard a MPLS circuit is virtual? Can someone clear up this concept for me on how the physical connections are.

 Looking on amazon at stuff like this:
 https://www.amazon.co.uk/SGILE-Network-Computer-Maintenance-Stripper/dp/B06X1BKFY9/ref&#x3D;sr_1_1?crid&#x3D;S8O0ZBVFGF6Y&amp;keywords&#x3D;network%2Btool%2Bkit&amp;qid&#x3D;1665076310&amp;qu&#x3D;eyJxc2MiOiI0LjYwIiwicXNhIjoiNC4xNSIsInFzcCI6IjMuOTYifQ%3D%3D&amp;s&#x3D;diy&amp;sprefix&#x3D;network%2Btool%2Bki%2Cdiy%2C55&amp;sr&#x3D;1-1&amp;th&#x3D;1
 Or screwfix at something a bit more pricey:
 https://www.screwfix.com/p/lan-installation-tool-kit-55-pieces/66910#product_additional_details_container
 What is the difference between these? I imagine the crimpers are much better quality, just wanted some advice, I&#x27;m not really a network engineer just have to dabble now and then,
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey there,
 We have a client that was having slow download speeds while on the Global VPN client. I did some digging and found an article that describes a technology called Receive Segment Coalescing which from what I could gather is used to offload processing to NIC of the machine. They stated that Microsoft recommended disabling this feature so I gave a try with the client. Sure enough it worked like a charm but I&#x27;m trying to understand why this fixed the issue. Maybe I have to do some more digging but was curious if anyone on here happen to know anything about this.

                              <span>Hey everyone, looking for some advice.
 We are moving to a new 9500sq. ft. heavy equipment shop (aprox. 12 bays).
 basic info:
 -ISP will be starlink (remote location)
 -5-15 admin users doing only ERP + google suite(email, drive)
 -big empty warehouse, 115x85ft, 24ft tall. Only obstructions would be actual steel columns and equipment sitting there
 -small 9x20ft drywall office in the middle
 -remote location means IT support will be mostly remote
 -EDIT, forgot to add, 6-10 poe security cameras.
 ​
 Project needs:
 We need a good wifi coverage in the entire warehouse, use will be on the light side. Initially I wanted to avoid running utp cables in my service racks (oil, air, etc) so I wanted to explore a mesh solution that would only require a central node with data plus 4-6 antennas connected to power outlets. Is there a commercial/enterprise mesh wifi that you guys would recommend or instead invest in a switch, running utp cables, and APs?

                              <span>EDIT: When you have a duplicate address problem, it&#x27;s probably because you set things up incorrectly so that there is a duplicate IP on the network. 
 Our order is still trickling in, but I got a few devices so I figured I&#x27;d set up a Switch and AP so I can start getting our RADIUS / Eduroam / WPN set up on the AP. 
 Plugged the Meraki into the Cisco 2960S with both sides on a Trunk port. 
 Am able to use multiple VLans on the Meraki. Can see the internet, can ping other VLans. Routing is working fine, DHCP to a new test Server is working fine, and DNS is working fine. 
 The issue is that on the core switch we&#x27;re getting that error %IP-4-DUPADDR: Duplicate address which is seeing the downlink interface MAC as assigned to the Gateway IP for the Meraki Management VLan, but that Gateway IP is also assigned to the SVI on the Core Switch (Cisco 4500x). 
 You can easily see this by either pinging outside from the Windows Server (Google DNS is the main test IP), but it&#x27;s the same from the Windows Server to the 4500x (Pure Storage -&gt; Nexus -&gt; 4500x). But pinging from the 4500x to the ASA it fails not at all. 
 I believe that by removing BDPU Guard on the 2960S downlink interface so I could attach the Meraki I should also enable Root Guard on the Meraki to allow BDPU frames to flow down and to not have the Meraki think the uplink interface is the root bridge in its little STP brain. 
 Any assistance would be appreciated.

                              <span>Our company monitors and supports basic networks throughout the country. What I mean by that is usually all we are monitoring is the Carriers Gateway, Our firewall/gateway, Our Switching and the wireless access points.
 For the last 8 years we were using the .exe version of Mikrotik&#x27;s The Dude for monitoring. But it really is becoming unusable. We constantly rebuilding it after the database corrupts. 
 We have tested Zabbix and Open NMS but we really don&#x27;t have the resources to self host and maintain. We are considering Open NMS Meridian at this time but was wondering if anyone has any suggestions. It does not need to be free or open source. It also cannot require a PC or some type of equipment onsite to run an agent. 
 The Dude was very simple to use with its ability to build the maps, add separate sites, add notes and add objects. We have not really found anything exactly the same. Anyone know of anything similar? We also use ConnectWise Manage. Integration would be nice but not necessary.

                              <span>I want to set up ACS TR-069 server for TP-Link routers (mostrly) and seeing that their AgileSolution doesn&#x27;t work properly on Europe becuase of old Agile 1.1 verison with limited options, i want to set up my own ACS server.
 I didn&#x27;t go too deep and found GenieACS as a free open-source option.
 Does anyone have experience using it and know if it&#x27;s good or there are any other options?
 I see that the software has regular updates, i will set up a VM and try test with some routers before deploy to end-users...

                              <span>Hi. I obtained a used HP 1920s from the working environment (at least they told me so) but when I try to access the web interface to configure it, I simply can&#x27;t get into it. I have another switch that is my DHCP, when I connected the 1920s to that switch with the patch cord, the 1920s doesn&#x27;t get any IP address at all. I don&#x27;t see this in the log. I found that the default IP for HP 1920s switche is 192.168.1.1 My main switch is also configured for this IP. Ok, I tried to connect directly to the laptop. I have configured IPv4 on the Windows machine to be IP - 192.168.1.10 Mask default 255.25.255.0. The switch is not accessible on 192.168.1. And I can see it&#x27;s connected with 100MB but should be 1G. Does it mean the switch is dead? Or I am doing something wrong? Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m doing some research with vrfs and routing, and I&#x27;m trying to get my head around the way host can interact with multiple routing tables.
 I have N (e.g. 2) vrfs with associated routing tables. For simplicity, let&#x27;s call it as usual, red/blue. Each of vrfs has veth interface linking into depth of Openstack, (but it&#x27;s not important). red should have route to 10.0.1.0/24 via veth_red and blue should have route to 10.0.2.0/24 via veth_blue.
 I also has 10.0.3.0/24 on the dummy0 on host.
 I want to make both 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.2.0/14 to be reachable from dummy0. And I can&#x27;t undestand what route and where should I put.
 I need to put route to blue vrf for 10.0.1.0/24 (and corresponding red). But how should I force host to look into those tables?

 I know seesaw and nginx (and HAp and Trae) but there&#x27;s surprisingly little info about load balancing designs in the DC. Most of it is cloud.

 Question. Is it enough to have a wifi network device (router, AP, extender etc) that supports WPA3 and has the 802.11w standard (with protected management frames)? 
 Or do the cameras need something to them as well? Like do the cameras need to support 802.11w or something for this to work? My cameras doesn&#x27;t have Ethernet support.

 ​
 Sorry if it sounds dumb or not. 
 So we have our own /24 ip-block and have connections in the 350 E Cermak data center, and we get everything routed correctly in our market, except google.
 Analyzing our traffic, any type of google traffic is not reaching the Chicago region, but going to Amsterdam which is a whole other country.
 What throws me off, any google traffic from our /24 blocks goes to Amsterdam, but if use our carrier network from DC I am able to reach google in our Chicago Market... 
 I have verified everything from Geo-Location is correct to anything, still makes me pull my hair out lol.
 Verified from our carrier that they are peering with google in the same building.
 ​
 Any reason why only Google tossing our traffic to another country?

Summary
This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) provides the top Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) used since 2020 by People’s Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored cyber actors as assessed by the National Security Agency (NSA), Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). PRC state-sponsored cyber actors continue to exploit known vulnerabilities to actively target U.S. and allied networks as well as software and hardware companies to steal intellectual property and develop access into sensitive networks.
This joint CSA builds on previous NSA, CISA, and FBI reporting to inform federal and state, local, tribal and territorial (SLTT) government; critical infrastructure, including the Def…</span>

                              <span>So this one has been a doozy, I just wanted to see if anyone has experienced anything similar. 
 We recently had our static IP pool increased from a /30 to a /29. Ever since the change, we&#x27;ve had persistent bandwidth issues. Upload is pitiful, download is meh on what&#x27;s supposed to be 200 symmetrical. I spent way too much time this week digging through firewall configs, running iperf tests throughout the network, checkin MTU size, cables, and generally tearing our network apart while the ISP was unresponsive. 
 I tested multiple devices of different brands isolated on the direct connection, all capable of pulling gigabit+, and all pulled 60 max. Configured the firewalls to be glorified routers, both still pulled pitiful speeds. 
 I was running a tracert during this diagnosis and saw an interesting IP in there... our old gateway for the previous static pool we had. But the firewalls and routers I tested on the connection all had the new IP and gateway set. On each, packets hit the router, hit the old gateway ip, then went on their way. All show the new public static. 
 I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s the cause of the bandwidth issues we&#x27;re having (though I believe I&#x27;ve conclusively ruled out anything on our end causing it unless like 6 different routers/firewalls with no extra configs have the same issue). 
 Anyone seen an ISP route you through the wrong gateway regardless of the config on your end? Definitely a first for me.

                              <span>I keep going round and round with the security guy at my work. He believes it is a perfectly acceptable solution to have an internal server accessible from the internet as long as it passes through some type of &quot;proxy&quot; in the DMZ. These proxies can range from an F5 virtual server that is NOT doing any WAF, to just an IIS box setup to reverse proxy. 
 In my mind I believe this is a bad idea because these proxies just do trash-in trash-out and any compromise that were to occur would now be in an internal server network instead of a DMZ.
 Is this really not as bad as I think it is, or am I right to question this practice?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I just have a question or a curiosity to ask. I am currently a Jr Network Engineer. CCENT certified. Tried CCNA before the redo and failed by 25 points. Planning on taking it again before the year ends.
 My question is: After I pass (If I pass) CCNA, with the networking world changing and heading into automation and software defined networks, should I consider a cert such as DevNet? Or would I be wasting my time and should focus in something like CCNP or Juniper?

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious how you all handle your dynamic inventories? I have a inventory file I created with 500+ devices that I seperate into various groups, etc. It will become cumbersome to maintain by hand over time, with co-workers adding and removing devices on the network.
 What method do you all use to automate this? Do you do something like python scripts that interact with your NMS?

                              <span>Wondering if anyone on here can provide feedback on working with Cato networks?
 Cato’s infrastructure/Setup is very new to me but it is appealing, the whole idea of everything happening in cato’s cloud would pretty much replace a lot of appliances in our data centre.
 I’m looking for Pros,Cons and ultimately if its worth it as this would replace our VPLS infrastructure.

 Since almost that exact time, our production VLAN is incredibly unstable. We have all meraki MS 225 edge switches, MS 425 core switches, and an MX 400 security appliance. All traffic goes through the 425s and the MX 400 before exiting on the WAN port and going into a state owned and supported Cisco 3850 router. The router and everything outside of it is managed by the State, and I have no visibility or control over it, so I can only define what I&#x27;m doing to troubleshoot inside our network. 
 On our production VLAN, about every 10-15 minutes, we spike to around 100% packet loss…</span>

                              <span>When a firewall leaves a http client hanging because it got on a blacklist of some kind, what is this technique called in networking? I heard someone use the term sandtrapping but I found no references to this anywhere.
 Basically, if a client gets blacklisted, the firewall stop responding at some point in the process which will often make http clients just hang eternally. I&#x27;ve seen CMS providers do this before where once blocked, python http requests, curl, wget will all just hang up until the process is killed or if a explicit timeout is defined.
 Is there a term given for this type of technique in networking?

 It&#x27;s a stack of (3) Cisco 9300&#x27;s, and they&#x27;re all 48 copper port switches, however in the config it&#x27;s showing the following:
 switch 1 provision c9300-48t switch 2 provision c9300-24t switch 3 provision c9300-24t 
 I tried to just overwrite it by entering &quot;switch 2 provision c9300-48t&quot; while in global config mode but it doesn&#x27;t seem to change anything. After, I tried to remove the 24t entry first, but it says &quot;Error: A switch is already physically present at this location&quot;. 
 How can I get this to show up correctly so I can access/configure all 48 ports on switches 2 and 3?

 I&#x27;m racking my brains trying to figure it out but the network looks fine in our DC. 
 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has come across this issue as well before?

                              <span>Hello. I am having a problem with an automation I am writing but I am having some difficulty with troubleshooting SCP on a Cisco 2960X. 
 ​
 I have two different Ansible servers. One is local to the switch, same subnet, etc. The other is a remote host in Azure, with a port forward for this specific IP to translate TCP 2222 to 22 to this test switch. The local Ansible server appears to start SCP sessions as intended. No problems, nothing in the logs to indicate any problem, multiple 40 mb files transferred. The remote one is able to open a SSH connection, but SCP sessions fail. 
 I have turned debugging on in the switch and while I do see the remote Ansible server is able to start a session, there is little to nothing in the log to indicate a problem. Same with a packet capture. It appears to start a session, start a second session, then gracefully closes both sessions. 
 The code sample I am using on both Ansible servers is identical and a direct SCP session using Ubuntu CLI does not work either. 
 The only relevant error I am seeing is from the playbook when it fails:
 ​
  
TASK [Copying image to the switch... This can take time, please wait...] ************************************************************** 
 fatal: [%hostName%]: FAILED! &#x3D;&gt; {&quot;changed&quot;: false, &quot;destination&quot;: &quot;flash:/test.txt&quot;, &quot;msg&quot;: &quot;Exception received: Error transferring file to flash:/test.txt: Initializing SCP session of remote file [flash:/test.txt] for write failed with error [b&#x27;Socket error: No such file or directory&#x27;]&quot;}
  
I am frankly running out of ideas, as this makes no sense as to why its not working.

 I have a question regarding 802.1X. In our company we have a Development Department and guys need to run some VMs on their laptops.
 What would the behaviour be for the laptop with VMs installed?
  
Laptop will be authenticated and also VMs, since laptop (as host) is authenticated
 
Laptop will be authenticated but VMs will be not
 
Laptop will be unauthenticated also as VMs

                              <span>I have a set of network access requirements for some systems:
  
Domains or IP addresses
 Ports
  
I would need to block connections that are not to one of those domain/IP and port combination.
 In a firewall, I am able to hardcode IP addresses that need to be allowed. For example, I can create a rule to allow traffic:
  
TCP
 IP : 123.123.123.123
 Port : 25
  
And block all other Port 25 requests, for example.
 However, the tricky thing is when domains are involved. For example, if I need to allow:
  
TCP
 Domain : Reddit.com
 Port : 443
  
I need to allow Port 443 through my firewall, but I cannot hardcore any IP addresses.
 I am now using Cisco Umbrella for DNS filtering, so that I can block DNS requests to domains that are not approved. So in the above example, I would add Reddit.com to the allow list.
 However, with port 443 now open in the firewall, and since I cannot hardcore IP addresses and rely on DNS filtering, a virus could use an IP address to exploit port 443 (no DNS request to Cisco Umbrella).
 Cisco Umbrella has an agent to guard against this, but I can’t install it because I have a Ubuntu system.
 Cisco Umbrella aside, how can you guard against viruses using hardcoded IP addresses and circumventing DNS filtering?
 I should add : I am using Ubuntu Linux as a WireGuard sever, so not a NGFW

                              <span>So we have been having issues with a switch we recently put into place in a building on our base. The setup is as follows....
 Core switch &gt; 3850 fiber switch &gt; 3560 access switch
 With this setup, we have been having some problems and we believe they are related to AAA. Our AAA server is ISE and it is doing TACACS as well as RADIUS and MAB for clients.
 The failures seem to be intermittent, but basically out of 4 clients, only 2 of them will authenticate. The other 2 are not failing authentication, but the MACs are also not showing up anywhere. Its like they aren&#x27;t even there, even though the interface is up. The 2 devices will briefly be put into the correct VLAN, but then after a minute or so, they go back into our &quot;black hole&quot; vlan, and nothing about them shows up in the switch logs or ISE logs. 
 So my question is, could the issue be the fact that we are daisy chaining the 3560 and not going directly to our core switch? My boss seems to think that a setup like this is not how networking should be done. I do agree that it probably is not best practice, but I feel like the issue would be more so if the 3850 switch can handle the load of traffic going over it. Would there be any special type of configuration that needs done with a setup like this, besides just configuring a normal trunk port?
 Another thing that just popped up is we noticed that we have &quot;switchport block unicast&quot; on the trunk ports. We referenced another network that we managed and on that network, we only have that command on the access ports. Could that possibly be causing the inconsistent authentication errors?

                              <span>What is the rout selection process of a Router or L3 switch in deciding which route to take if it has vrf enabled. Will it check the global routing table first then if not found it&#x27;ll look at local vrf table, or will it check the vrf first then the grt? 
 Finally the one i&#x27;m bit confused is, if multiple vrfs has route to the same destination, which metrics are used to select the vrf to use.

 For example let&#x27;s say I have experience with Debian but the company I want to apply to is using Ubuntu, so when the interview comes should I&#x27;d say I know linux but not Ubuntu specifically. Would this lower my chances of being hired by alot?
 When I know something in theory but don&#x27;t remeber the commands should i say I know how to do it and then watch online for the commands?
  
Thanks all in advance to all the replies, I&#x27;m a bit anxious and I don&#x27;t want to do bad in my first job!

 This means that if I have a device connected only to the master module and my master module is active, the VLAN does not reach the final device because the switch has to switch from master to slave?

                              <span>Hi guys, got an interesting issue at my workplace and would like to know if you guys have had any such experiences.
 . We maintain a sd wan network with remote sites all over the world and one of them was complaining about a server not being reachable intermittently, this server is accessed by this site only so we only got this complaint from them, interestingly, we are able to ping this server once or twice successfully from Site A core switch, but the rest of the attempts fail to reach for some time, then works again and so forth, meanwhile site B is able to reach it the same time A couldn&#x27;t, the same thing happens when trying from B when B couldn&#x27;t reach while A could, this is not a packet loss issue btw, when it pings, it pings perfectly without latency or loss even 10k reps, but when it fails, it fails completely. I understand the issue has to be with the server, but can&#x27;t figure out what, probably multiple session related, I would like to know if you guys have experienced any such issues, Im not deeply experienced myself but haven&#x27;t come across this issue.

                              <span>Hi
 Let&#x27;s say i start the policy with fundamental template and set it to transparent and enforcement period is 7 days, now after 7 days will the policy move to blocking automatically? Or can i control the timing, because i wouldn&#x27;t want the policy to move into blocking at night or something, so how can i control the timing?
 Also, note the fundamental policy template starts in blocking mode right away..
 And even with 7 days of enforcement period, the automatic policy builder will restart the policy building process everytime it detects new traffic right? How does this work exactly?

                              <span>Does anyone know of a reasonably priced cloud-based RADIUS solution that can validate against Azure AD for user AND machine certificates with PEAP-EAP, and validate user credentials with PEAP-MSCHAPv2?
 I have trialed quite a few now (JumpCloud, RADIUSaaS, FoxPass) and they all seem to do user auth, but not device certificate auth. It looks like Portnox CLEAR could do it, but it is very expensive when we use half of the minimum device qty. Anyone have any suggestions?

 Lately I&#x27;ve been giving jr. members of the team an opportunity to deploy new stuff. I feel like I&#x27;m giving them the gift of a fun break from the monotony of working tickets. 
 Of course it could also feel like I&#x27;m dumping work on them, making them perform duties beyond their role, or expecting too much of jr folks. 
 How do you guys feel? What are ways I can make sure it&#x27;s a fun learning experience and not a heart attack?

I do all the hands-on work and implementation. I don’t have buy-in from CEO or Chairman (separate people) or execs, but they’ve begrudgingly gone alone with most of my changes, until now. We recently went through a hellish few months re-applying for cyber insurance policy after being dropped (which we’re required to have for certain types of business), and thanks to all my changes I’d implemented over the last few years we…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m used to installing printers on a print server using print management.
 These new HP printers require this software package to install them that doesn&#x27;t run on Windows Server OS&#x27;s. 
 For instance: https://support.hp.com/ca-en/drivers/selfservice/hp-laserjet-pro-3001-3008dne-dwe-hp-printer-series/38120047/model/38120950
 The HP Universal Print Driver would not install as a driver for this device.
 To get this printer setup on our print server, I had to start the install on a Win10 workstation, Download the driver package, Move the package up to the server, Extract the files inside the .exe file, and install a driver using those extracted files. 
 What the heck am I missing here? I&#x27;ve started to see this on new HP Business printers more and more. How does HP want us to handle setting up these printers in an environment with AD? I want to be able to push them out with GPOs... What gives?

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been tasked with taking over management of a small management company in our organization. They are completely legally separate from our main org, so they can&#x27;t be on our main infrastructure. 
 They&#x27;re only 10 employees, but need an RDS server as they have an old-school financial system and a couple apps which need to run on a server (and need SQL). Currently they have an older RDS server managed by an outgoing MSP. That server is attached to the MSP&#x27;s domain, so the users use separate credentials for logging in to RDS.
 We&#x27;re replacing/upgrading the RDS server, which on the surface is easy enough. The challenge is - this company has no domain environment otherwise, so on top of an RDS server, we&#x27;d have to spin up a DC. They do have 365 / Azure AD though.
 Just wondering - is there a more graceful way of handling RDS without the domain? Could people login using Azure auth. I&#x27;m looking for the simplist and most gaceful way of hosting a small RDS environment for 10-12 users.

                              <span>Or in other words: Do I need a backup MX?
 The situation is this: I want to receive newsletters from news sites. Some senders are high traffic senders that send out a lot of emails to each subscriber, sometimes even 1 per minute, or 1 per 10 minutes on average.
 I have trouble with receiving this amount with various email service providers, because I run into receiving rate limits. So, I’m considering hosting my own mail server for this purpose.
 But self-hosting on a VPS can have outages…
 I don’t mind if some emails get lost if the senders don’t retry, but I don’t want them to stop sending me all together if my server goes down temporarily.
 Let’s say my server goes down for 1 or 2 days for whatever reason. (Let’s not discuss how likely it is. There may be an outage, or I may screw something up.) Also, let’s assume my server is either up or down, but when it’s up, it’s accepting mails normally. So, I’m not rejecting mails.
 So, the question is this: If there is a busy sender that sends out a huge number of emails, and they see my server went offline or port 25 is not responding for a day or two, then what happens? What’s the most common behaviour? Will they resume sending me when my server comes online again? Or will they consider me gone forever?
 Phrasing it in another way: How long would a receiving mail server need to be down in order for a busy sender to stop sending to it all together?
 Or does it depend on the sender and the situation, and there is no standard behaviour?
 The special situation here is that these are busy senders. I understand that normally a sender should and will retry. But when a sender sends out hundreds of emails a day or more to each of its subscribers, they may handle this differently.
 Again, I don’t mind lost mails, I just don’t want to re-subscribe to the newsletters after every outage I may have.
 And I don’t really want to have a backup MX unless I really need to.
 Some expert advice would be appreciated… Thank you.

                              <span>Just curious if and what limitations you have set in your environment. I ask because I just had to modify our policies for the Karens executives and their assistants who refuse to use OneDrive/SharePoint. Our policy is now 100MB limit for all users but all execs and their assistants are exempted. This is after I explained the ramifications and how easy it is to use OneDrive/SharePoint. Going forward, any complaints tickets about mailboxes over the size limit or performance issues will be closed with &quot;You were warned. Reap what you sew.&quot;

 I&#x27;m looking at APC models so far, any advice is welcome. These units will be running a few cisco switches, a meraki firewall (mx-85) and some other smaller devices like a unifi AP.
 Thanks!

Currently working for a big tech with a good salary especially in 3rd world countries. I thought it&#x27;s ok until realized that i was not following the cloud trend. Now they&#x27;re all talking about cloud, CICD, pipeline, microservices and can have a very attractive income. I&#x27;m reaching 40 soon and concerning about my career path. I have spent lot of time and effort to become a well-known person in my country and is one of the guys in my region can handle vmware vcd/vcf/vrealize suite along with nonstop backup system and multisite storages in-depth. All my skilled experience are used in very limited enterprise customer. Thinking about one day I receive the termination letter, how can I overcome. I don&#x27;t think I can&#x27;t get a new job but about the salary. How to keep it AS IS without knowing of new technologies. Does anyone of you guy facing the same issue with me?

                              <span>Hey all, I’m a sysadmin with a little over 3 years of professional experience in IT. I’m coming up on a year in my current role and am becoming stagnant. I don’t see any potential of upward mobility and my learning is decreasing over time. This has me looking for the next move. It’s no secret that DevOps and cloud are some of the hottest spaces in IT right now. Pondering transitioning into one of the other, some questions that come to mind are:
 -What are the pros and cons of each?
 -How similar are they? It seems like oftentimes I’ll see cloud and DevOps in the same sentence.
 -As a current sysadmin, what are the most important skills for me to acquire to land one of these roles?
 To expand a bit more on the last one, my current technical skillset includes general Windows enterprise management (AD, DNS, server administration w/ VMWare), intermediate scripting skill in PowerShell, automation experience with Ansible, exposure to monitoring/alerting with Prometheus &amp; Grafana… just to name a few. So pretty general sysadmin in the modern world I would say.
 To create a plan of action, I’m looking to determine what skills to develop and how to prioritize them. Some that immediately come to mind are:
 -AWS -Terraform -Python
 What am I missing from this list, and what are your thoughts?

                              <span>Been a very busy week(s) for me. BCDR plan in hand mostly everything went off without a hitch. Any lessons learned post storm? Stories? 
 I work for an environmental company managing their tech and vendors...you all know the kind of &quot;Its ITs issue&quot; that happens.... It will be nice to get back to 45-50 hours a week.

                              <span>Hello Sysadmin,
 I&#x27;ve inherited an infrastructure with an Hyper-V Cluster running in Windows server 2012 over 4 PowerEdge FC630 in a FX Cluster , there was a crash of one of the blades, and I started to get around to understand how all of this was setup (knowing the previous Admin that worked on itisn&#x27;t there anymore)
 Basically right now I am facing an issue on SCVMM 2012/Hyper-V Cluter manager where I have the subnet created for LIVE Migration showing 2 subnets, the one for live migration (10.0.12.0/24) and the one for Heartbeat (10.0.11.0/24) and if I look at the Live migration settings on HyperV/SCVMM, there is indeed 10.0.11.0/24 configured as a subnet, and the delete button is greyed out, even if I add 10.0.12.0/24 and put it first, same thing if I run a powershell command, the subnet 11.0 won&#x27;t disappear
 How the setup is, NIC1 and NIC2 are bonded/teamed on the windows server, there&#x27;s a virtual switch created from SCVMM, with 3 interfaces on different vlan/subnet for Heartbeat/LiveMigration/HostHyperV
 Thanks for reading through and any help appreciated

I almost find that more stressful. When on vacation I will do things like monitor when I get up before I leave for the day and possibly later in the night.
 For my honeymoon I did uninstall the Outlook app and told my lead to text/email me if there was something going on that he couldn&#x27;t handle. Email is still tricky because it&#x27;s all or nothing.
 How much interaction with work/your systems do you have when on vacation? If you say you disconnect 100% how are you backed up while you&#x27;re off?

Our SPF record doesn&#x27;t seem to include the IP address of SF&#x27;s servers. Is including their IPs on our SPF record all it&#x27;s going to take to fix?

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 Long-time lurker, first time poster here. I hope someone here can help me get some insights on this.
 From a lot of our users, we have been getting reports that Outlook unexpectedly crashes (complete process restart).
 So far it has been impossible to reproduce, we can only analyze the logs after the fact and the only thing we know so far is that if we turn one specific add-in off, then the problem stops (it&#x27;s a local add-in that helps sending e-mails with a configurable template). This add-in runs on .NET and is written in C#.
 While the support team of this add-in has been very involved with us in trying to fix this issue, there is still no way to reproduce it and management now presented us a deadline to fix it before the end of October.
 We have spent weeks gathering and…</span>

 Have a bit of a strange one... This morning we&#x27;ve had loads of users complaining that they received multiple Teams meeting cancellation emails for various old meetings in the early hours of the morning (4:00am UK time). I&#x27;ve spoken to one organizer of one of these meetings. It was set up in October 2020 and he&#x27;s adamant that he hasn&#x27;t manually cancelled it himself. It appears its been automatically cancelled and then a notification email was sent to all users of said meeting at 4:00am.
 Is this something Outlook / Teams does automatically?
 Are there any settings available to control this behavior - particularly not to send these emails in the early hours?
 Any help, greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I have user account that keeps locking out every couple of hours, the users account has been migrated to 365 but the logs say it is locking out against our on-prem exchange server and the source network address is an IP address from a Microsoft data center. 
 I’ve used netwrix and that says it is an Android 1.0 device with an incorrect password, the user says they don’t have an android device and using powershell the only mobile I can see that the user has with their email on is an iPhone which has successfully synced today. 
 Does anyone have any other solutions or things I could look at? I’m really starting to run out of ideas.

 Let&#x27;s say the users name is Dom Sales. He was set up as Dom Sale, which is wrong. I come back to fix this after he mentions it. Log into 365, update display name and contact info in active users. Save. 3 hours later it&#x27;s back to Sale. Log in again, this time make sure it&#x27;s updated in AzureAD and Exchange, query with PS. 3 hours later it&#x27;s changed back again. Log in with PS and update it again. Query with PS, check Exchange, Active Users, and AzureAD. 3 hours later it&#x27;s changed back.

                              <span>Esteemed Admins,
 I have a 2012 R2 box, which is more or less patched up to date, so far as I can tell.
 However, IIS is v6.2
 I gather IIS gets uplifted by Windows updates? What gives? 
 I need this box to be IIS 7.2 because reasons.. how do I get it there?

                              <span>Hi,
 We have a hybrid environment (Win2016/Exchange 2016), that I am gradually migrating to Office 365.
 Migrating users is going fluently.
 However we also have some distribution groups, used for &#x27;generic&#x27; email addresses. 
 The issue is that these distribution groups are not synced to Office 365 (by AD Connect). So as they are not visible in Office365, I can&#x27;t migrate them to Office 365. 
 For Ad Connect, I have made a security group &quot;AD Sync Office 365&quot;, that I have added all users to. And in AD Connect wizard, I am have selected this security group in the filtering page. So AD connect is only syncing object in this security group.
 So I am suspecting that our distribution groups are not syncing because these distribution groups are not a member of the mentioned security group. And I can&#x27;t find a way to add he distribution groups to this security group.
 In AD connect troubleshooting these distribution groups , I also get this error :
 Object is not present in sync scope as group filtering is enabled and the object is not a member of filtering group &quot;CN&#x3D;AD_Sync_Office365,OU&#x3D;Security Groups,OU&#x3D;MyBusiness,DC&#x3D;xxxxx,DC&#x3D;local&quot;.
 Do you have some advice?

 We already have a confluence instantce running. 
 Whats the best way to start documenting things. Do you use templates or something like that?

                              <span>I am having to enrol a number of devices into AzureAD + Endpoint (Intune) so they are managed and protected. There are a few devices that are used only for testing purposes running a batch of code for example but any user will do this.
 So I assume this is just getting an intune device license and setting it up as a shared device as per this guide??
 I&#x27;ve not done this before as all users are normally assigned to devices with M365 Bus prem or E3. Is this the correct way to do this?

                              <span>We have an RDS deployment running a single RemoteApp group and 4 load balanced Session Hosts.
 Due to issues with roaming profiles, we want to restrict this RemoteApp group to a single session per user as much as possible.
 I&#x27;m at the point where I&#x27;ve managed to change the sessions limit so individual session host VM will only accept 1 active/disconnected session per user, which is great cause it means we can&#x27;t have Mike logging into RDS #4 twice at the same time from 2 clients.
 ​
 However because the Session Hosts are load balanced using a broker, I can&#x27;t control on which server someone is going to get a session. Which means that even though Mike is logged into RDS #4, there&#x27;s a possibility he&#x27;ll also get a new session on RDS #2 if he logs on from a different PC.
 Preferably in this case want session RDS #4 to get disconnected and reactivated on his new client.
 ​
 Does anyone know whether this is possible?

                              <span>I want to run my Rust API web server on Hetzner&#x27;s cheapest cloud offering called CX11 for 4.55 €/month. Specs are:
 CX11
 vCPU 1 Intel
 RAM 2 GB
 Disk space 20 GB
 Traffic 20 TB
 The backend Rust app (using Actix) is a non-issue - it&#x27;s under 20MB and no RAM spikes at all even under benchmarking via wrk etc.
 The proxy server will by Nginx which is also a non-issue when it comes to RAM consumption.
 I want to use Ubuntu 22.04 but if it eat too much RAM perhaps I could try Alpine - I want to run things like wkhtmltopdf (this will spike the RAM for a few seconds unfortunatelly) etc. but perhaps that is a non-issue.
 I don&#x27;t want to use Docker - the 2 GB RAM would be an issue and with one file deployment of the Rust binary app it&#x27;s not worth it.
 The most important question I have is about the SQL db I will use.
 So, it has to be relational database and I have only a couple of options: MySQL, PostgreSQL and perhaps some forks like MariaDB or something else.
 Can you recommend a DB that is the most RAM efficient under heavy load? I am mostly interested in reads, not so much writes into the DB. As I said it is an API backend that mostly serves JSON via relatively simple selects and an occassional joint here and there - nothing too crazy though.
 I will probably off-load the homepage for not-logged in users and some mostly accessed parts of the app to Redis, but still, I want something that would work relatively well when it comes to the available 2 GB RAM even without Redis - at least from the beginning ;)
 It will be mostly mobile apps accessing the API, so frontend rendering etc. is not the problem here.
 Thanks for your recommendation and advice - especially if you have used Hetzner CX11 servers or some other servers like this with databases.

 We are looking for a controller-based network-solution with sites as UniFi&#x27;s solution for small-medium businesses due to the lack of support and products itself being out of stock.
 Essentially where we could gather all customer-sites and manage.
 Preferably not the most expensive brands.

                              <span>Hi, 
 Recently I have got into I.T, in our warehouse prob( 300-400 people overall) as someone with no IT background. We are working as system administrators even though we do not access to a lot of stuff, we have a HQ group called Central , they have to give permissions for certain stuff( I assue they are level 2 or level 3 ). So recently for preaparation for Black Friday our packing department have been prepared and did some mock test with like 50 packers at the same time. 
 The problem is that as soon as people (30-50 start to work the invoice from our printer gets really slow to print sometimes (1- 2 minutes, normally it takes like 5-10 second).
 We use DLX as a WMS. We have given a list to Central with all the cabinets and sockets that these printers are using so they can monitor it. They said they have not seen any slowness from that part. ok.
 In DLX we have a thing called &quot;Run Task&quot;. It basically shows when the sytem processed the order. So if you check the time from the moment you press the print button after you packed an order until the run task actually run you can see the time it took to process it. its quick like couple seconds. ok. 
 And then we have a print server where we have all the printers added ( something like a print host). This is the last idea we have currently to check how long does it take from the DLX to send the information to this print server. Everything we have checked or sent to Central came back as no issues or signs for slowness.
 Also its confusing because during people&#x27;s breaktime there were like 25 packers only, printing went back to like 5 second. And then after an hour with like 30 or 35 ish people it just slowed down to 1 minute again. ( it is kind of inconsistent.)
 ​
 Does anybody have any other idea what would worth to be checked?

                              <span>We have Sophos firewalls and the VPN is kinda flaky. Not looking to replace the firewalls.
 Is there a good solid VPN solution out there for end-user remote access to internal systems that we could use to replace that functionality in Sophos?

                              <span>Seriously, I hate hate hate working anything in Infrastructure IT. I’ve gone from job to job working various sys admin and cloud roles and they are all the same, public and private sector. Between the overnight maintenance windows, the early morning releases, the horrible on call, the boss who expects you in at your regular time despite being up at 2-4am for maintenance while on call, the sleep deprivation, constant projects and dealing with non technical people with big dreams but no idea how to achieve them so they look to you. I am so done with it all and feel like a failure to my family when I have to leave a job due to absolutely becoming a zombie of a person. 
 I remember being way happier when I worked at McDonald’s as a youth. At least I could go home and do whatever for the rest of the night and not have to worry about work. 
 My most care free time in IT was working as a 3rd tier Support Analyst, just working tickets out of Service Now all day and being on call once every 3 months where you could go years without getting called. I either need to try and do something like that again or change industries completely because IT Infrastructure is not it for me.

                              <span>We are a small org. Originally we use AD to manage OUs and users. The users mainly use Gsuite. So if an admin changes password they usually do it through G admin.
 We now have a bunch of windows devices managed through AD using intune also account.
 What&#x27;s the best approach for password sync Or should we keep them separate..?
 MS pass to log into devices and Gsuite for cloud?

 I&#x27;ve had it with this vendor and since the big heads at my company seem to just love throwing money at them, I can&#x27;t pull up and say that we are wasting time and money dealing with a vendor that puts as little effort as possible into my team&#x27;s requirements.
 Background... I manage field support for a utility. My team consists of 10 techs covering around 150 sites (plants, offices, field dispatch, etc) on the USA east coast (NY down to NC). My team uses this vendor for sourcing and configuration of Cisco gear (switches, routers, WAPs), but they&#x27;re involved in a lot of my company&#x27;s critical applications and infrastructure.

They know I&#x27;m a junior in this role but I still feel incredibly in over my head, today was my first day and tomorrow I&#x27;m going to be doing my first actual tasks/problems, any veteran sysadmins got advice for keeping the anxiety down and also moving relatively quickly, I&#x27;ve already poured heavily over documentation used to run our infrastructure and the architecture of it, it&#x27;s your standard k8s-docker setup with some virtual machines and bare metal, with a bit of Ansible and ovirt.
 Feeling like I&#x27;m going to do something stupid that will get me fired or reveal myself as too incompetent (honestly probably not that justified of a fear considering the company is having a hard time finding people but still and they had no problems with me being a junior but i dunno, expectations are hard to measure!). 
 (My previous work was in security testing, compliance and a small amount of security maintainance/implementation on infrastructure, although not containerised at all, just bare metal servers).

                              <span>There are lots posts about people getting great positions in IT and getting great raises, bonuses, and benefits and there are lots of posts hating on IT, issues with the field and problems with vendors and end users but I think we should talk about the good side of the field a little bit this time. 
 One of my personal favorite things about IT is, I get to see the amazement on people&#x27;s faces when I show them something that they rarely get to see or experience. (showed a friend a 2Petabyte Ceph Cluster that I helped create for a company (permission given from the company, of course)) That and I just love tinkering with stuff, its like playing with Legos, there&#x27;s always something to create, rebuild, make better, etc. There&#x27;s many reasons why I like IT but those are just the some of the reasons.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve had a very successful run with 95% of the place WFH, including IT staff since March 2020. In the beginning of 2021 we had a layoff and purged the dead weight that was simply f*cking off at home and not getting work done.
 Now they want people coming back to the office. And people are just quitting, especially managers. And when we interview people, we tell them that we want them in 2 days a week. We make them an offer, and they don&#x27;t even return our calls to accept it.
 My manager is still there, but her boss is gone. All of my manager&#x27;s peers have left in the last 2 months.
 Everyone says that they&#x27;re more than willing to come into the office, but only if there is a reason to. There&#x27;s no point in dragging yourself into the office if you&#x27;re just going to be on Teams calls and remotely connecting to stuff. You can do all that at home and save yourself the commute.
 There&#x27;s a rumor they&#x27;re going to start reviewing badge access logs to make sure people are coming in.
 I&#x27;m curious how this is going to end. We&#x27;re bleeding IT staff every month.

 Employee B sends Employee A an encrypted message. What key encrypts and decrypts the message ?
 Employee A created a secret key and what&#x27;s to send it to Employee B without anyone else being able to decrypt the message. Which keys encrypts the message ? 
 From my understanding it&#x27;s Employees; public key....but why would you encrypt a message with a &quot; public &quot; key ? The whole point or a &quot; secret &quot; is to keep it &quot; private &quot;.

                              <span>Without giving away too many details, I’ve been working for a company for a few years now. I started in one department, did well, and was later noticed and recruited by the manager of another department. I believe that should’ve been the first red flag but I was overwhelmed by the opportunity of reaching a personal goal by entering this new department, that I transferred anyways. I started noticing other issues right away. 
 My new manager is constantly changing the priority and scope of projects. It gives me the impression that he didn’t understand or plan out the project well to begin with. 
 Anytime he has to give us “bad news” he’s always blame-shifting that someone else is making him do it. That tells me that he’s not willing to take responsibility for management’s decisions and makes…</span>

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I have been tasked with finding laptops for new hires and the CEO would like a &quot;range of options&quot; from $100 - $400. Usually, finding laptops is easy. However, looking for laptops in this cheaper, budget range has been difficult. Every list, forum post, recommendation, etc. for employee laptops are all over $400.
 Is anyone here knowledgeable about reliable, lower end budget laptops? I am going to convince the CEO that anything near $100 is not going to work (unless I am wrong here) and we will want something solid closer to the $300 - 400 range.
 Any insights? Thank you in advance. 
 WOW! Thank you for all of the responses everyone - I gained some great insights here.

 On Android new versions it makes you fill out the domain if you haven’t got the certificate.

                              <span>Former sysadmin who recently became a pentester speaking.
 In like half of deployments I&#x27;ve seen that the default passwords on printers were not changed.
 I get it, I was guilty of this as a sysadmin as well. &quot;It&#x27;s just a printer, what damage can it do&quot;.
 Well, once I started pentesting, I realized that if a service is setup with credentials in the printer (LDAP, SMTP, SMB, etc) I could point it back at my machine, and capture the credentials.
 Sometimes it&#x27;s just gives me access to a regular domain account.
 But in several engagements I&#x27;ve used this to priv esc and become domain admin.
 A few examples of how I became domain admin:-The accounts had DCsync privileges, so I could sync all the domain account NTLM hashes and privesc that way-Password reuse and printer service account shared the same password with a domain admin-One service account had domain admin rights
 This isn&#x27;t a new attack. After I discovered this attack path, I stumbled across a presentation from Defcon 19 (which was 11 years ago) talking about these sort of attacks.
 The remediation is simple though, just change your MFPs&#x27; default passwords.

 From what I&#x27;m able to tell that since we are hybrid we need to have a paid AzureAD license for each user who is going to use Hello for Business. Can anybody confirm/deny this? 
 Also has anybody had any luck with implementing the in their enviroment?

                              <span>Does anyone know how to use the ForensiT User Profile Wizard tool?
 I have about 20 computers that are not in any domain joined. Not even in AzureAD.
 Now I want to migrate them to M365 and not lose the profiles. I came across ForensiT while looking for a tool.
 With which version can I make my requirements:
 - Devices from workgroup to azure ad
 - Apply local profile to the user from Azure AD (this should then log in)
 Can someone roughly describe the steps to be taken?
 On first impressions this looks like a very cool thing and I hope it is for what I envision.

The errors are vague but it only seems to be affecting Exchange users, not 365 (we&#x27;re hybrid currently).
 Would love to know if this is affecting anyone else, and figured we can use this thread to voice any other issues with this workaround.

                              <span>I was wondering how old domains and previous admins making various changes to domains at the admin level such as sweeping permission changes misconfigurations that are carried forward to each successive migration NT4, 2000, .. 2019 etc. Does Microsoft do any checks and bounds to verify any excessive permissions. Do some thing get corrected automagically during an upgrade?
 I am mainly talking about historic misconfigurations. Is there any way to really clean this stuff up. Think of the current domain you are running.. who was running it when it was NT4, receptionist?, Some random office guy? What did they do to it? Inexperienced Admins?
 I know I made errors that I had to clean up later. I also had to clean up things I noticed wrong. I am sure I left some dirty socks somewhere as well. 
 Where do these problems come back and bite us in the ass? Is this part of the growth process of a large secure mature network that has someone go through a total clean up of the domain threw some involved process in the manner a domain must be cleaned after a breach?

                              <span>Hello,
 I just need an idea or a few and some criticism from someone with experience in PS scripting, if any of you has the patience. I have just a bit of experience with scripting, but mainly simple commands (I don&#x27;t dare calling them scripts) like get-something|foreach{ do some stuff}. And I composed this first big script that I intend to use in automated AzAD user provisioning. 
 The script will take the employee data (Firstname, lastname, workmail, etc) from the HR System (BambooHR) with an API call and it then creates users/modify them in AzAD using a foreach loop, some identifiers from BambooHR attributes+AzAD attributes and IFs to identify the operations needed to be performed. I also wanted to have logging as good as possible, there are still some things to be improved on this part too. It&#x27;s not yet completed, this is the first working and tested version, (I did run it in production, yes :) but before I did, I exported every single user attribute/licenses info to a csv and prepared a script to restore everything back to the state using this csv) I will also adjust the documentation based on the final result. I&#x27;m also thinking of a better...logical way to go for 3 big IF-s. But I was thinking, what else can I use instead of those many many If-s? I thought of array comparison, but there would still be IF-s....some custom function? Please let me know some suggestions, and how good I&#x27;m doing.
 Overall, the script performance looks &quot;ok&quot; from my perspective (the company has less than 150 employees right now) and, when it had to modify about 10 users and create 2 accounts, it took 2 minutes to run. And when it just checked stuff, with applying only 2 modifications, it took 34 seconds.
 Here you can find it
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I work in IT with a university. My question is, how often should users turn off their workstations? There is alot faculty that work from home and they need their pc on so they could remote in. Im not sure about leaving a computer on 24/7, should i tell them to shut it down at least once a week? 
 Some hate restarting their workstations because it might go to an update mode.
 Thank you

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m looking for some advice on an external Microsoft365 spam/phishing blocking service.
 I obviously started with looking up on Google and there&#x27;s lots of services that look like they would fit the bill, but before I start submitting my email and number to companies for quotes I Thought it would be best off to get the communities advice.
 We are currently a company of 64 users but quickly growing and Ideally looking for the following as minimum:
  
Spam Blocking
 Phishing blocking
 Email Spoofing
 A services that allows for easy scalability as we grow with numbers.
  
If anyone can recommend a product and price per user then I&#x27;d be eternally grateful.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello,
 I have never managed to do much money in IT and now that I can begin to do so, I&#x27;ve realised I feel very done with the industry. No amount of money seems enough to put up with it, I truly struggle to care or feel invested and I have become a mediocre sys admin because of it.
 I don&#x27;t think I have ever felt satisfied with IT after university, my perception of it shattered rather quickly, I went from studying, discussing and working on projects of all sorts to &quot;desktop support&quot; jobs making minimum wage in the most expensive part of the country. 
 I don&#x27;t think I have had a single good employer, by the point I&#x27;ve become a sys admin I have become cynical and mercenary-like. Increasingly so... At my current place, I was told: &quot;the business wants to get more from you than it pays&quot;. This …</span>

 I have installed updates via wsus before but there is currently a filter created for the updates so all I do every month is approve the updates for the applicable servers. If I am dealing with a new server, presumably I need a lot of updates. So do you put this new vm in its own group, then go into the wsus and approve all the updates I need for this 1 group? (that way only this pc gets all these updates) how do I know which updates will need to be installed? I figured I would then remove the pc from this group and put it into the permanent group I use for Server 2019 computers.
 I am asking you guys so that I at least have the right idea. I can figure out how to implement it.
 I need clarification because on my own personal computer, when it&#x27;s brand new, it usually gets a bunch of updates. I imagine this is the same way that things work for a brand new windows server. Perhaps this is not the case?
 thanks.

                              <span>Hi All,
 We&#x27;re currently in the process of moving to 2022 server. The new servers have been promoted as DCs and are replicating with no issues. 
 When running repadmin /showrepl and repadmin /replsummary there are no issues. But when running DCDiag we see:
 Starting test: DFSREvent
 There are warning or error events within the last 24 hours after the
 SYSVOL has been shared. Failing SYSVOL replication problems may cause
 Group Policy problems.
 ......................... DC1 failed test DFSREvent
 ​
 We&#x27;re wanting to move the FSMO roles across. However not sure where to proceed with the following errors. 
 We get a warning first:
 The DFS Replication service is stopping communication with partner DC2 for replication group Domain System Volume due to an error. The service will retry the connection periodically. 
 Additional Information: 
 Error: 9036 (Paused for backup or restore) 
 Connection ID: 
 Replication Group ID: 
 Followed by an informational: (This happens about 20 seconds later)
 The DFS Replication service successfully established an inbound connection with partner DC2 for replication group Domain System Volume. 
 Additional Information: 
 Connection Address Used: DC2
 Connection ID: 
 Replication Group ID: 
 ​
 My main concern is if we move the FSMO with these current warnings and something fails we&#x27;re stuck.
 A google hasn&#x27;t really brought up much advices.
 If anyone could point me in the right direction that would be great.

 I could describe our intended setup, but I&#x27;m really trying to understand why I&#x27;d pick push or pull so that I&#x27;ll know the answer in any setup.
 Searching this sub hasn&#x27;t thrown up anything too obvious so please, if you have any advice, I&#x27;ll all ears. (Which makes it hard to type.)

I didn&#x27;t get told at our branch this was coming..so much for change management
 Our internet has been functionally broken now for the 2 days they did it. (hsts, encryption errors all suggesting that deep ssl has broken stuff)
  
This becomes very frustrating. Our division may be sold (which I&#x27;m now more welcoming) but corp to down applies a feature, breaks our internet and I&#x27;m left holding the end user bag. I can&#x27;t literally change anything just factually reply (and very carefully) about what&#x27;s broken. The fact that I found about this change AFTER they did it surprises me not at all.

 Once I set the MAR attributes for the phone it works fine, but I&#x27;m trying to understand why the port just doesn&#x27;t shut immediately with a phone (or any IoT device that doesn&#x27;t understand 802.1x for that matter).
 I&#x27;m not trying to fix this, I&#x27;m just trying to understand why. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a lot (any) of literature that discusses this.

                              <span>Hey guys!
 Thought I would share. I bought my first server today. It is old, but I&#x27;m super happy with it. Only ever rented hardware in DCs so never had the opportunity to interact with physical servers. I plan on just using it to learn. I am only 20 and saved for a bit to get it.
 If anyone wants to give some advice, tips and tricks, etc., or even things to do that are interesting, would love to hear it! Very passionate about hardware, hosting, etc.
 For those interested specs and photos are below :)
 2 x Xeon X5670
 16GB RAM

                              <span>Hi all,
 Would be good to know how people are blocking Windows 11 who are managing many devices.
 We use N-Able RMM Patching which has not been successful in blocking Windows 11 and when we called support they simply provided a script to set the target release.
 Many of our clients are Intune but we&#x27;ve chosen to use N-Able for patching primarily to cover third party patching but we&#x27;re unsure if we enable the Feature Update Ring in Intune whether that would work in stopping Windows 11. I think we found if N-Able is on the device it takes over all elements of the patching aspect and ignores Intune.
 In any case we are meandering options but would be good to know what you do.
 Another question - if you set the target release on a device does that prompt it to update immediately or does that just say to the device you can only go up to this release as and when its made available?
 ​
 Many thanks.

                              <span>I wasn&#x27;t sure if this was the best place to ask this, but let&#x27;s give it a go!
 I have a client that uses a few hosted internal HTTP sites. These sites are also forwarded on from the router so external access is possible. They have now requested for the sites to be secure, and use HTTPS (when accessing externally via the forwarded port) as that complies with their external IT team&#x27;s policies. I am aware you need an SSL certificate to do this, and probably need one with a SAN of the external IP address.
 Where do you install this though? On the router? On each of the HTTP web servers?
 All help would be appreciated!

 We’re looking at going love with InTune shortly (azure AD Hybrid environment). I’m struggling to understand how group policy comes into play. Can it still be used? If we deploy using group policy, how do intune policies work?

                              <span>So I&#x27;m applying for a sysadmin role in a company at the moment. Have gotten to the 3rd stage of interviews. Company has scheduled 5 interviews at this stage. Asked the recruiter who I was meeting (ie role on company) and didn&#x27;t get a reply. Yesterday, completely blindsided by a network admin who leaned heavily into security. I&#x27;m a bit worried that I&#x27;ve come across a bit foolish, as if I&#x27;d known who they they were, I&#x27;d have been better prepped.
 Am I right to be worried, or was this person just an extreme case? I&#x27;ve had 1 other interview at this stage and it wasn&#x27;t as bad, more like what technologies I know etc.
 Also, is this amount of interviews at this stage normal (based in EMEA)

 My admin account work on other computers, and other accounts work on my computer (as long as I remember to activate my PIM role before I try to do an administrative task). 
 My computer is an Azure AD only device managed with Intune. I have tried several reboots and made sure to activate my PIM role before i try to use the account. Normally I use &quot;run as&quot; on my administrative task, but the same issue occurs even when I log in to the computer with the admin account. After doing some testing the same issue appears when logging in other computers without enabling the PIM role.
 Based on this I believe that my admin account is somhow cached on my device, and it believes that it is not an admin. Is there a way to make my computer know that my admin user has admin rights (hopefully remote and without admin access)?

                              <span>Hi all, my question is in the title, so I&#x27;ve been using RDP but I read online that its not very safe. So any other alternative or is there some trick to make the RDP safer? 
 I know strong password but even then, I know they somehow get access to open session without even needing a password.
 ​
 Anyway thanks in advance.

                              <span>I have a rather curious thing going on in my environment. I work at a company with a bit of shared infrastructure, and I don&#x27;t set all the rules myself. Yesterday, I created a scheduled task to remove some junk every minute - a bad workaround until I find a better solution. However, this morning I find that the task failed to run from 23:00:00 until 06:00:00 when it started to work again. The error code is 2147943728 which translates to a bad password. Is it possible to set a time between certain hours when an account should be disabled? And then reenable it on schedule? I am unable to find anything in regard to this in GPO. Please see the screenshot below.

                              <span>I have a question about how the DUAL algorithm works, perhaps it is obvious but overlooked in the literature. What happens when a link drop/trace disconnect occurs when there are several successors but no FS (all the routes have the same metric)? Is the algorithm not activated and just the next successors take the place of the predecessor, or is the algorithm being ran and the successors are recalculated?
 Edit: Maybe I have not specified enough, I mean such a specific case as in the screenshot. It is a route from R2 to R7, R2 has 3 tracks, all are successors (each link has the same cost) and no FS. If the link between R2 and R3 fails, will one of the two other successors be added to the routing table immediately, or will the algorithm restart and recalculate the routes?

                              <span>I support a nonprofit that has an office on the ground floor of a three-story mixed commercial office building. We have a small network with a file server, Unifi edgerouter and UAP 2.4/5 access point. Because of the nature of the nonprofit&#x27;s work, specialists need to bring their work laptops in and out and switch rooms frequently, and so hardwiring really isn&#x27;t an option. Recently, users have been getting disconnected from the wifi intermittently in the afternoons between about 2 and 4. I added a second AP to a corner of the office where a lot of interruptions were reported, but it hasn&#x27;t seemed to help. I&#x27;ve tried different channels, as it is a crowded environment, but no luck, and the APs automatically choose channels in normal operation anyway). I&#x27;ve confirmed that it isn&#x27;t an issue with the network itself; hardwired devices work fine, and network activity appears normal. The issue is disconnection from the access points. I&#x27;ve spoken to several of our neighbors; a next-door neighbor reports the same thing, the one on the other side doesn&#x27;t. 
 I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s some kind of RF interference that&#x27;s causing this, but I&#x27;m at a loss as to how to track it down. The issue of whether it&#x27;s a 2.4ghz vs 5ghz issue is a bit murky to me, since (as is common) the two bands share the same SSID, so it&#x27;s difficult to know which one a device is connecting to. The building is kind of a beast, so the 5ghz AP doesn&#x27;t penetrate walls well. In any case, I don&#x27;t want to confuse users by splitting them up, though.
 How would y&#x27;all proceed from here?

                              <span>Hi,
 Looking to get some help with this device but before I start I just wanted to mention I have some basic networking knowledge and was just given this to figure out and configure. 
 Problem: After setting up the AP with an IP and Name. I assigned a DHCP pool(with gateway &amp; DNS). Everything works fine until I power it off and back on to see if it will come back up and the SSID doesn&#x27;t broadcast. 
 How I configured: 1. connected to POE+ switch, AP powered on
 2. connected to the AP via putty to view the status
 3. connected to the AP&#x27;s default SSD
 3. opened https://mywifi.cisco.com/webui/ and logged w/ webui/cisco credentials
 4. Followed the initial config steps with admin account, SSID name and IP for the AP
 5. reconnected to the AP via the new SSID
 6. configured an IP to my laptop of the same subnet and opened the webui via the IP I assigned, logged in with admin I created
 7. created a DHCP pool(assigned gateway and DNS)
 8. removed the static IP and reconnected to see if the DHCP works 
 After those steps it looked to be working fine, until I rebooted it and the SSID is no where to be found.
 Appreciate any help &amp; suggestions

                              <span>I&#x27;m troubleshooting a scenario described in title Aplication installed on a windows workstation and it&#x27;s Server is in a LAN environment (Enterprise). Video Stream is happening over TCP. Upon packet captures on both sides, I have observed there is significant latency of 10 to 30 seconds in Pings responses and other messages like Ack. I have also noticed &quot;Bytes in flight&quot; are exceeding &quot;Calculated window size&quot; I have also noticed window scaling factor &#x3D; -2, -4 and so on.
 I juat want your opinion/suggestions on how i can convey this to software developers of the Application to fix/tune their TCP socket programming.
 From my point of view I cannot see application taking leverage of Reliability factor of TCP where a lost frame is retransmitted and arranged in order at the receiver side.
 Thank You in Advance!

                              <span>Our company setup has VPN tunnels coming from a NSA 2650 at our main location to different Sonicwalls located in different cities of different models. (TZ370,TZ300,TZ400,TZ600p). Im working on failover and like to have it when our main site goes down the other sonicwall takes over the vpn tunnels. This site will also host the backup AD and terminal server hosting our main application. I think I have everything figured out except the failover for the vpn tunnel itself.

                              <span>Hello everyone. We are a small company looking to replace our SonicWall. 
 We have three sites : one main site with TZ600 in HA cluster (40 users/computers - 2 esx) and two other sites with TZ300 (5 users/computers - 1 small server and 20 users/computers - 1 small server).
 Our biggest site has a main internet fiber (200 Mbs) with backup link, some VOIP phones with dedicated fiber (20 Mbs). The other two sites only have one internet link each (about 50 Mbs per site).
 The current needs we have/features we use : traffic/content/geo filtering, load balancing for wan interfaces, site to site VPN (with the physical sites and Azure), user VPN, DPI, IDS/IPS.
 In the future I know for sure our CEO will ask us for internet usage reports and such things.
 Management would also love to reduce the cost of the annual licence (budget is max 2000$ for all three sites per year) and even better, go with pfSense and only pay support. Even though we are a small company, I am not convinced with pfSense as I have only seen them in homelabs situation.
 Also Fortinet would be the cherry on top but it is probably too expensive for us ?
 As I am mostly a sys/cloud admin, I am looking for your kind help if you have any recommendations and hope I provided enough details.
 Thank you

                              <span>So we have an issue we are trying to troubleshoot. Our setup is this....
 Core &gt; 3850 fiber switch &gt; 3560 switch
 All switches are using ISE for tacacs.
 The issue is with the 3rd switch that is not connected directly to the core. It will sometimes let us log in with the usernames we have saved on ISE, and then sometimes those wont work and we will have to use the local account that is setup on the switch as an account of last resort. 
 When we have the login issues, all the switch logs tell us is that authentication has failed with that username. We don&#x27;t see any logs about losing connection to ISE or anything like that. Just the username authentication failures. 
 When we look at ISE, we do not see the authentication failures, all we see are the successful authentications. So that tells me that when we are having the authentication issues, we some how are losing connection to ISE because these failures are not shown. 
 We are also using ISE for RADIUS and doing client authentication with MAB. Clients are also losing their authentication intermittently. Same thing though, this failure is not shown on ISE.
 This issue only occurs with the switch that is &quot;daisy chained&quot; and not directly connected to the core. And again, nothing in the logs indicating a loss with the ISE server.
 Does anyone have any idea what could be the issue? We are on a webex with TAC at the moment, but seem to not be getting anywhere. My assumption is that the daisy chained switch is some how losing connection to ISE, but again not seeing any logs indicating this. Connection to the switch is not an issue, because like I said , when this issue occurs, I can still reach the switch and login with the local account.

                              <span>Hi, i work at an ISP and we provide DIA for customers. We have one customer where we provided internet for them, when we tested it from the laptop, it worked fine. But when plugging it into the router, it does not work. We tried 6 different routers, from home ones to business ones. We tried to check for any policies with the IT team and everything is alright. We&#x27;ve used the same switch for diff. companies and it worked fine. In fact, we have the same exact setup at a diff. location and it works just fine. The connection is through a microwave link. We&#x27;ve tried to add multiple public IPs, and extend but nothing worked. We contacted our main provider and they said the issue is not from their side (their customer service is non existent) we have 48 hours before the customer cancels their service. the only solution i can think of is to use the server as a router but obv there&#x27;s a deeper issue. Any help would be HIGHLY appreciated

                              <span>Hello,
 I am currently working on onboarding our new OCI environment which will be connected to our On-prem DC via a Layer 2 Cloud Cross Connect that has been provided to us by Megaport. I have configured both BGP on Fast Connect within OCI, and BGP on the 9K that is again hosted on our On-Prem DC. Thus far I am able to ping from the 9K to the OCI side just fine however BGP is stuck in IDLE.. From what I see from parsing through the BGP debugs it looks like a &quot; maximum number of prefixes reached&quot;, however, I am unsure of how since I have not set any limiters on this and I am also not sure if this is what is preventing BGP peering to form.. Thanks for any of your provided advice/tips.
 Topology:

 I have read on this from Cisco is to apply &quot;No vStack&quot; command in global configuration. however I am worried this will break the stack config on the switches??? any thoughs if I apply this will it break the stack configuration to the other switches?

                              <span>User moved offices recently and has been having issues with their desktop connectivity. They connected to the jack on the wall, but were unable to get out to the internet. We can plug any other device into this port and receive a DHCP address and ping other devices on the LAN and out to internet. Whenever this desktop is plugged in, it has always received the same IP address even after removing reservation. Could be lease time I guess. The only switches I found onsite are Cisco SGs that dont seem to have any port security or port channel configs. Another weird thing is when the desktop was plugged into the problem port, the firewall&#x27;s arp table shows the device&#x27;s MAC address. 
 The DHCP address its receiving is fine and from correct server. I tried a static and same issue. Also the desktop works fine elsewhere. Its just this desktop with this port. Very confused. Looking for ideas. New to environment and past employees are gone. No idea when switches were last powercycled, but I do have CLI access.

Summary
Actions to Help Protect Against Russian State-Sponsored Malicious Cyber Activity:
From November 2021 through January 2022, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) responded to advanced persistent threat (APT) activity on a Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Sector organization’s enterprise network. During incident response activities, CISA uncovered that likely multiple APT groups compromised the organization’s network, and some APT actors had long-term access to the environment. APT actors used an open-source toolkit called Impacket to gain their foothold within the environment and further compromise the network, and also used a custom data exfiltration tool, CovalentStealer, to steal the victim’s sensitive data.

                              <span>Hiya!
 I wanted to see if anyone has run into a similar situation. 
 I have a setup where I am using a core transport router for aggregation into an edge router. Both are handed off using an ASR 9k. 
 We recently swapped the ASR 9k (running IOS XR) for the transport out from an ASR 900 (running IOS XE). 
 Out of around 50 mpls LDP l2vpn&#x27;s, 7 or so would not come up on the new router, so we had to hand them off on a different router that is in the same DC. The router that works with the remote peers is an IOS XE device. 
 Everything that we can see is matching (MTU, tag manipulation, etc.) 
 The xconnect/psuedowires are coming up/establishing, but are not performing two-way traffic on the connection. We can see this in some cases first-hand since we own the connections ourselves on both sides of the interfaces. 
 I have also started a TAC case to see if we have encountered some bug in the code, etc. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I was able to pass the initial round of AWS&#x27;s screening, and I&#x27;ve already provided them my preferred time for the phone interview (not yet confirmed). Therefore, I wondered if anyone here had recent job interview with them and would mind sharing some advice on how to ace it or at the very least your strategy for passing the technical interview. Some folks in Glasdoor says that the q&amp;a is quite difficult.
 It appears that some of the Q&amp;A require a deep understanding of the TCP even the required years of experience are equal to associate level. lol I definitely need to prepare for and refresh on that.... already forgot some foundations and basics. :) Do I need to write any code for the automation part, or can I just explain the method and procedure (ex func, modules etc).
 Ive been watching a lot of youtube vids, and I&#x27;m wondering if I should just use the Star approach or if I also need to have the 16 Leader Principles in my pocket for the phone interviewer or for the Loop interview.
 They say that, before the pandemic they sponsored the applicant&#x27;s flight and accommodation to Sydney for a face-to-face interview.. 5-6hrs interview haha... but has been replaced by this loop interview which is virtual :(.
 Anyways, whatever happens, it seems like this will be a positive experience.

                              <span>I am working on a trunk link and noticed the aqua om3 cable being used and the SFP+ were LR and traffic was getting through. However, there some instances that packets were failing. 
 I swapped the LR with an 10G-SR and the links showed as notconnected. The transceiver showed the rx was -3db. I changed the SFP to 1G SX and this one worked and I was able to pass traffic.
 Why the 10G-SR was showing down/down despite the rx was -3db? The duplex was full and the speed was 10Gbps. I can see the red light at the end of the cable.
 The working one is 1G SX and the switch interface being used was the &quot;ten1/1/x&quot; instead of g1/1/x. 
 What does it mean if the SFP+ SR not showing any light from its tx port? Does the LR modules show light on its tx port?

                              <span>Hi /r/networking
 We&#x27;re rolling out remote access to 100+ remote workers at a health care organization (mid-size and fast growing). Their different offices are geographically separated and each office has an-prem SQL based application isolated behind a firewall. They are using Fortinet for their firewall stack. Using VPN based approach gave pretty poor results in terms of launching the application. It took about 10-15 minutes just to load the application over VPN. Whereas in normal cases it takes about 10-15 seconds to fully load the application.
 I came across some other technologies like ZTNA, SDP, and SASE but I&#x27;m not very familiar with these solutions, however we&#x27;re open to any ideas. 
 Any suggestions on how to improve performance and eliminate as much latencies as possible would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Hello r/networking. I just took on a new role and we have a learning lab environment that was now passed on to me. There is already a pre-existing topology and I was given just excel sheets for the various IP addresses, point-to-point connections, and usernames and passwords for the whole setup (although it&#x27;s useful, it&#x27;s still not the most put together but I am grateful).
 Does anyone have any recommendations for a potential, better way to keep track of everything, and maybe I even get to see the whole topology, virtually, so I can have a better idea of how everything is interconnected? I was thinking of something like one of the two major network simulation tools. How have you kept track of your environment?

                              <span>What&#x27;s your go to/standard for power requirements for a MDF/server room?
 We are looking at refreshing an existing MDF at a corp location and will be re-doing the power. Currently everything is connected directly to the back of an 16kVa with a mix of NEMA 5-15 and twist lock connections (L6-20 &amp; L6-30). 
 We are going to try and move everything that can be over to 208v outlets and standardized on PDUs between our racks. 
 Currently estimating 3.2kW - 4.5kW per rack. Would you stick with dual L6-30 outlets per rack, or would you go with L14-30, L21-30, etc?

                              <span>Heads up, this is a theoretical design for my College Network Design class. 
 So we were tasked to create a network for our assigned business. We got assigned a sales company, 50 users. In our original design, we have a PA-820 doing the internal routing along with it&#x27;s firewall duties. One of my classmates was giving me shit about how it wouldn&#x27;t be able to handle internal traffic for 50 users and handle the SSL/TLS Decryption and other features. I&#x27;m not sure if he&#x27;s blowing smoke up my ass or what... I would like to try and prove him wrong but I don&#x27;t really have any metrics as to what kind of internal traffic we would be handling - as it&#x27;s all theoretical. 
 Which leads me to my question. Is it common practice for small / medium sized businesses to buy separate equipment for their router and firewall? Is it really not reasonable to have a FW of that caliber do the internal routing? At my workplace we have multiple branch offices with 20-80 people and our older MX64&#x27;s handle it just fine.

                              <span>Looking for a little guidance....
 Customer needs a site to site VPN set up. Policy based ikev2.
 Internal networks are say 10.0.1.0/24 and 10.0.100.0/24
 Remote site consists of 2 IPs - say 192.168.10.10 and 192.168.10.20.
 The problem is that the remote site will only accept traffic coming from 172.16.0.0/28 .
 I&#x27;d like any suggestions on how to accomplish this inside the ASA. I&#x27;m at a loss of how to re-address traffic from 10.0.1.0 / 10.0.100.0 to 172.16.0.0 before it heads to the outside interface.
 Additionally due to the size discrepancies of the 10 vs 172 networks - it seems like it would somehow need to involve a nat dynamic interface type setup...
 Thanks!

                              <span>Been chasing down this strange issue where devices randomly become inaccessible. So far I&#x27;ve had about a dozen different devices (NAS, Printers, Moxas) in different vlans in the past week. We notice suddenly we are not able to ping a device. If you get on the same vlan, you can ping it. When I check the network switch, it does not show a mac address associated with that device. Unplugging and plugging back in doesn&#x27;t work neither does changing to another static IP (same vlan). If you change the vlan and slap on a different IP, it&#x27;ll ping; then if you change it back to the original vlan, it&#x27;ll still ping. 
 The one thing in common with all of these issues is that the mac address does not appear on the switch it&#x27;s connected to (different switches/models/locations). The switches all connect to a router, which also does not show the mac address. So I&#x27;m assuming since that information isn&#x27;t anywhere, when I ping a device, the router doesn&#x27;t know where to send it. Anyone ever deal with this?

                              <span>Hello r/networking
 I know there are lots of post about different firewalls and heck I have used most of them myself.
 I am in a rare position where I am building out some new infrastructure and the C suite truly just wants to provide me the budget to purchase the best of what I need. 
 I am leaning towards Palo as its just a rock solid product and in my experience it has been great. Their lead times are a little out of control so I do need to look at other options if that doesn&#x27;t pan out. 
 My VAR is pushing a juniper solution but I have never used juniper and I&#x27;m not really sure I want to go down that rabbit hole. 
 All that being said if you had a blank check which product would you go with an why? 
 ​
 I should mention we are a pretty small shop. We will be running an MPLS some basic routing (This isn&#x27;t configured yet so I&#x27;m not tied to any specific protocol as of now), VPN&#x27;s and just a handful of networks. We do have client facing web servers and some other services but nothing so complex that it would rule any one enterprise product out.

                              <span>Within our datacenter we use a lot of SR optics and OM4 patch cables. I&#x27;m currently planning on migrating a machine from using 1g copper to 10g fiber. I&#x27;m running into the decision on what optics/cabling to go with.
 Are there any real advantages/disadvantages to using SR/LRM Singlemode/Multimode for short distances within a datacenter?
 The cost is very similar so that shouldn&#x27;t be a factor.

                              <span>Hey Guys,
 I have 5 AP&#x27;s on campus. For safety reasons, they do not have cat 6 because switches cannot be fielded, so I have one root AP and 4 client AP&#x27;s that bridge wirelessly back to the root AP with line of sight. Now I need to add more AP&#x27;s but they are too far from the root bridge and no line of sight. However, they do have line of sight to and are close enough to some of the client/non-root AP&#x27;s. Is there a way I can set up an AP in wireless repeater mode that peers to the non-root bridge while the non-root bridge maintains it&#x27;s wireless bridge connection to the root bridge?
 i.e. Repeater AP-------------Non-Root Bridge AP-----------------Root Bridge AP--------------------Core.
 The only cable involved here is the on on the root bridge back to the core. Everything else would be wireless peering.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to update ONIE on a refubished S4048 we&#x27;ve received, and it&#x27;s failing with an error (below) relating to the i2c device &quot;* Error: Could not open file &#x27;/dev/i2c-1&#x27;: No such device* &quot;.
 Other switches have taken the update without question, but I can&#x27;t find anything specific about this one that would explain it.
 A previous update attempt failed with &quot;./fw-install.sh: line 57: can&#x27;t create /mnt/onie-boot/onie/update/update.log: nonexistent directory&quot; but I fixed that with &#x27;mkdir /mnt/onie-boot/onie/update&#x27; followed by &#x27;touch /mnt/onie-boot/onie/update/update.log&#x27; -- however I suspect that this indicates some wrongness.
 If anyone had any ideas I&#x27;d be very grateful - needless to say this system is not under any form of support.

 Would you say this is a good network design? Any improvements? Unfortunately there are no redudancy protocols or such listed..

                              <span>Hi,
 For a trading application, I need to do an HTTP request to a certain endpoint, which in turn resolves to a CloudFlare IP. This CloudFlare IP is &quot;hosted&quot; in the NWAX Internet Exchange Point in Portland, and I would like to have the lowest latency possible to this IP. Right now I have my sever hosted in AWS Oregon and when I do traceroute I can see it does multiple hops to reach this CloudFlare IP.
 How can I reduce latency and even get to this IP address with only one hop? (I know this is possible since other people connecting to the same IP are already doing it) Will I need some kind of colocation service within NWAX, a cable, or a direct connection? (Sorry I&#x27;m a big networking noob)
 Thank you.

                              <span>Although this is not directly related to networking, I feel like many people in this career suffer from this so I felt it appropriate to share my experience here. If not feel free to remove. 
 From Google: Imposter Syndrome: Impostor syndrome, also known as impostor phenomenon or impostorism, is a psychological occurrence in which an individual doubts their skills, talents, or accomplishments and has a persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a fraud (and I would say failure/inadequate as well).

                              <span>Learning by doing continues. Few days ago I&#x27;ve posed a question about BGP EVPN VXLAN on Aruba-CX switches. Thanks to /u/WTFKEK I got it running. Now I want to add redundant internet connection to the setup. I&#x27;ve added a link between the internet router and DC1 switches and established the eBGP sessions between routers and DC1 switches. When everything is connected it works. But if I shutdown one link between router and switch traffic does not switch to the remaining link for half of the devices. 
 Steps done:

                              <span>Hello everybody, i have an issue with some Aruba CX Virtual.10.07.0004 version.
 To give some context, i&#x27;m making a lab on EVE-NG to create static VXLAN tunnels. I made IPv4 underlay with OSPF and BGP, and everything works fine, I can reach every Routing devices. Also the VXLAN tunnels seems to be up, with the command &quot;sh int vxlan 1&quot; i can see the other vtep-peer IP adn MAC address on the other side of the topology. I&#x27;m going through the process following guides and the official Aruba documentation https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/AOS-CX/10.07/PDF/5200-7890.pdf
 Onto the switches which are vteps i&#x27;ve created vlan 50 and associated it to vni 100. Then i went on the interfaces where i have VirtualPCs attached, i put them in &quot;no routing&quot; and then into &quot;vlan access 50&quot; (obv i enter &quot;no shutdown&quot; command). So this is only L2 configuration, no routing interested here. I gave ip addresses to the vpcs 172.16.0.10/24 and 172.16.0.15 /24. They&#x27;re in the same subnet but CANNOT ping, giving me &quot;host not reachable&quot; as feedback.
 I replicated the vlan configuration on Aruba CX 10.04.0001 version (which NOT support vxlan interfaces) and worked, the vpcs can ping each other.
 Is this a bug for the Aruba CX Virtual 10.07.0004 version or i have misconfigured something? Anyone had same issue? 
 [EDIT] Probably i can confirm it is a BUG. I downloaded 10.05 version, that support vxlan, recreated vlan scenarios and they can ping.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ll try keep the story short, I found out that when MTU size is 1500 for IPv6 interface I have problems (some sites unreachable or takes forever to open, speed test on speed.measurementlab.net is abyssal) and if I set it to 1490 it is fixed. The problem is thought, that when I use the command:
 netsh interface ipv6 set subinterface &quot;Ethernet 2&quot; mtu&#x3D;1490 store&#x3D;persistent
 it works great, but after a few minutes it is back to 1500 and everything starts breaking again.. Does anybody know how I can make sure it stays 1490 ? I guess there&#x27;s some &quot;smart&quot; functionality in windows that resets it for some reason ?
 P.S. The interface/subinterface is a &quot;Remote NDIS compatible device&quot; (I&#x27;m sharing my 5G mobile internet from my smartphone via USB Tethering if that gives any context.

                              <span>I have an issue where I have a second interface with no ARP showing for my neighbor.
 Basic over view is i have two IPSEC tunnels between my local PA220 and going to a remote headend. Same carrier is providing local WAN access and i can see a successful neighbour at eth1/1 
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ethernet1/1 160.242.92.177 50:87:89:e9:fc:b8 ethernet1/1 c 1465
 ​
 But when i check the second connection. 
 interface ip address hw address port status ttl
 --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ​
 I am checking my side configurations and unable to see any routes that may have been missed amd both ends have the same config. During troubleshooting i noticed this above in regard to BGP and ARP neighbours. 
 Is this likely an issue on the neighbour side ?

                              <span>Years ago, I read about 802.11y-2008, including the FCC&#x27;s &quot;light licensing&quot; scheme.
 Do actual, off-the-shelf products that someone can go and purchase as a semi-normal &quot;off the shelf&quot; item actually EXIST? Like, say (in descending order of sophistication &amp; usability):
  
802.11n/ac to 802.11y-2008 router/bridge (so, two could connect to each other via 802.11y-2008, then &quot;normal&quot; wi-fi/ethernet devices could connect to one &amp; communicate with devices connected to the other
 
PCIe (or mPCIe) 802.11y-2008 network card with working drivers for Windows &amp; Linux (so, you could build a PC, install a pair of network cards... one for wi-fi or ethernet, one for 802.11y-2008, install Linux, and configure it AS a homebrew router/bridge).
 
Any half-baked (but working) FCC-approved module that can do 802.11y-2008 &amp; interface via something like SPI, i2c, etc? Yeah, really scraping the bottom of the barrel here...
 
 Once or twice a year, I get in a new mood to see whether 802.11y-2008 finally exists yet. Every time, it seems like 802.11y-2008 has never actually existed anywhere besides as a theoretical paper standard. 
 Am I wrong?
 Example use case: splitting the cost of rarely-needed Starlink with a dozen or so people within a mile or two, shared via 802.11y-2008 backhaul, to bring the per-user-per-month cost down to something sane enough to get &quot;for the hell of it&quot; when some future hurricane knocks the local cellular network out of commission for days or weeks.

 This may sound crazy, but comments like this make me angry. I don’t like being told how to use my time off. If I wanna piecemeal it, it’s my right. If I wanna take a 3 week sabbatical into Europe, it’s my right. 
 It’s not my problem you staff this department with a skeleton crew so if one person is out that entire function ceases to progress until my return.

                              <span>So recently I&#x27;ve had to migrate the VM servers into a new hypervisor. 
 The issue I have is that I&#x27;ve only been with this company for a year, and everyone that knew anything about them is long gone. There is no documentation on each VM anywhere. 
 So obviously the simplest answer is shut it down and when some one complains then I&#x27;ll know, but I would like not to do that. 
 I have to shut down the server for the migration, but I would like to know what services I&#x27;m bring down. Obviously there&#x27;s simple ones like AD, DNS and DHCP, but others are leaving me puzzled. Some have a webserver service installed, but there&#x27;s no real files with any information saved in the server. I used the comman netstat to see traffic and there really isn&#x27;t anything and if there is its not enough information to go off of. 
 So what advice do you guys have when it comes to figuring out what the purpose of a server is?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to help a user with a seemingly simple request, configure Windows so is searches for the content of files (Word docs), not just the files themselves. The rub is they need to find documents containing T:\, and Windows will not process the backslash. Every document has T: in the header for the phone number, and even if I search (quotes included) &quot;T:\&quot; documents with only T: show up. I&#x27;ve pulled out all my hair and I&#x27;m about to start on my eyebrows. All of the index settings are correct, folder settings are correct, but Windows still search T: instead of T:. 
 Honestly, I don&#x27;t know what to do. If anyone has a trick up their sleeve and is willing to share, I&#x27;d super appreciate it. 
 That&#x27;s the end of my rant/plea.

                              <span>Hey there. I&#x27;m a long time sysadmin that recently transitioned to pen-testing a couple of month ago.
 Just wanted to let everyone know that if you&#x27;re using PDQ without LAPS, that&#x27;s a method I&#x27;ll usually use to privesc from local admin to domain admin.
 I&#x27;ve only been pen testing for a couple of months and I&#x27;ve already used PDQ to privesc in a few clients environments already. Basically every place I&#x27;ve seen PDQ. Sure, PDQ added LAPS functionality somewhat recently, but I haven&#x27;t seen a client that has used LAPS with PDQ. Usually they&#x27;ll create a service account with domain admin rights and that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ll use for PDQ.
 I tried bringing this up a couple of months ago in /r/pdq, but they did not want to hear it. I loved using PDQ as a sysadmin, but I think its users need to know this.
 Edit: typo
 Also, here’s the link from PDQ on how to setup PDQ with LAPS.

                              <span>Let me put some context before I ask my question:
 We have a very old ethernet switch: 3COM Baseline Switch 2924-SFP Plus (it was installed in the year 2009) and one of the ports has this SFP transceiver:
 Sfp transceiver
 My boss asked me to replace this switch and to accomplish this task, I need to know the type of transceiver.
 I plan to turn off the switch, disconnect the fiber optic patch cord and extract the transceiver to take photos of the patch cord and the transceiver.
 I have never in my life handled fiber optics sfps and patch cords and I don&#x27;t have any spares to replace them in case of problems.
 Now my questions:
 ¿Is this the proper, safe way to handle the sfp and fiber optics patch cord, without harming them?
 ¿If if fine to assume that when I insert the transceiver, connect the patch cord and turn on the switch everything is going to work again?
 Thanks in advance for your kind help.
 ​
 EDIT1: My boss told me that this fiber optic link was installed 20 to 22 years ago and this was not the first switch where it was connected.
 EDIT2: This a better photo of the fiber optic:
 Fiber optic better photo
 EDIT3: Accoding to web page of the switch, the link is 1000M of speed:

 How do you guys deal with those kinds of questions?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen a lot of talk on this sub about how &quot;quiet quitting&quot; doesn&#x27;t exist. As I understand it, quiet quitting is voluntarily putting in the bare minimum that doesn&#x27;t get you fired.
 And we see that everyday.
 People have been doing this at scale in the modern western workforce for decades, such as those with retirement on the horizon or people who only come to work to shop online and forward email. Add into that mix all the office politics and nepotism, and it&#x27;s ubiquitous.
 If you suffer an injury, are recovering from surgery, a personal situation occurs (death of a loved one, divorce, new baby, etc.), anything along those lines, obviously that may demand more time away from work and/or less ability to perform the work when doing it. I understand quiet quitting to be checking out just because.
 I&#x27;m open to discussion here. If there&#x27;s no clear definition, then we are arguing points on entirely different concepts.

                              <span>So our org is getting ready to start handing laptops to everyone instead of desktops. and we want to bit locker the drives. 
 what&#x27;s everyone doing for key management? 
 one idea floating around is using our pw management software to store them, but that seems a bit kludgy and I would rather use a M$ service if possible to make it as streamlined as possible. 
 Our org uses M365 business standard and aren&#x27;t opposed to getting licenses for other stuff if that would make the solution more streamlined. 
 thanks in advance!

                              <span>Need some suggestions on how to handle time syncing. I have a client that is on the road a lot, does not normally VPN into his domain, so his time is off. He put in a ticket wanting to change the time source to time.google.com. Does anybody deal with this differently, like put the laptop in a different OU that can get it set to that time source instead of the DC? Never ran into this problem before.

 Over the last two years, our sysadmin / cloud team went from 3 to 2, to 3, to 4 (for only a few weeks), to 3, to 2, to basically 1.
 The candidates we are getting want 120k+ fully remote and aren&#x27;t even that knowledgeable.
 Instead of letting me build a team how i see fit, and giving me a director role, the current VP and director seem to think we can just get through this... They are rolling the dice and think that it will get better by 2023 somehow.
 Company implosion coming... which will probably result in me losing my job. HA.

We&#x27;re getting phishing emails where the body of the email contains text from a legitimate email from 6-18 months prior so that it looks like a reply chain. The obvious phishing stuff is there; the sender address is wrong, there is a phishing link and password and lots of typos/poor grammar. 
 We&#x27;ve received 3 of these from separate companies, all small businesses. I&#x27;ve been able to confirm that one was definitely compromised in the past. 
 Anyone else getting these?

 I know how to restrict users to NOT be able to log into RDS, but what if I want them ONLY to be able to log into the RDS server?
 You can&#x27;t use the &quot;Log On To...&quot; option within AD as it appears that with RDS it also requires the user login access on in connecting PC too - but these users are remote (WFH). 
 So how do I go about allowing remote users ONLY access to the RDS server?
 Thanks, and I&#x27;m going to go get some more coffee.

 Would you fight him on this or just say fuck it and let him learn by finding out? 
 Not being able to choose my clients is a pain in the ass. I&#x27;d just not do work for them if it was my company, lol.

 I took the job because it was more pay and a unique opportunity to grow and learn(by fire mostly haha) in my career. Fast forward and my boss who had been with the company 4 years and knew EVERYTHING left. There is no documentation for anything it was all his tribal knowledge. I mean the guy basically worked alone for 4 years so I guess he didn&#x27;t feel the need to write things down.

 We currently have transport rules in place that block emails sent from @CompanyA to CompanyB customers and vice versa. However, it appears that someone can email from @CompanyA address to a CompanyA customer, and can CC in a @CompanyB email address. Big no no!
 Current setup:
 The sender is in group: CompanyA The recipient is located: External The CC box contains members of group: CompanyB
 Action: reject message with explanation: you dun goofed
 The original message is blocked from leaving the domain, but the CC address still receives it! This is driving me mad. Any Exchange gurus out there that can show me the tick box that I am missing?! TIA.

                              <span>Good morning IT peoples, my org is looking into implementing a PAM solution and I was wondering what some of you use. We&#x27;re currently leaning toward BeyondTrust PAM, but I&#x27;m curious if anyone has other suggestions. I&#x27;m also interested in hearing about your failures and triumphs with various PAMs. 
 For our purposes we&#x27;re looking to mostly manage vendor privileges and a handful of &quot;Super Users&quot; who occasionally need admin access to update schematic and map software we use. AD integration is a must, but it would also be nice to have a solution that will play nice with our SolarWinds ticketing system. Any advice will be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

                              <span>my employer is a fortinet partner and will cover the cost of training and the certification for the fortinet NSE4. I understand that the general consensus is that I should take the CCNA before the NSE4, however as the NSE4 would effectively be free does it make sense to take that before studying and paying for the CCNA out of pocket? I&#x27;m looking to move into a more security oriented role from my position as a Systems Admin.

                              <span>I attempted to clean install Windows 11 22H2 on my work laptop as a weekend project. Everything seemed to be working well, until I tried to add my user as a local admin. I kept getting a username or password is incorrect for my domain admin creds. I was able to RDP into a domain controller to verify I wasn&#x27;t locked out. Tried hitting multiple file shares, no dice. I was prompted for user creds. My older Surface was recently upgraded, so I verified the same failures on that as well. 
 All told, three 22H2 laptops seem to have a major issue with domain authentications. The Surface was upgraded, so I was able to roll back to 21H2, and all of the issues were resolved. 
 Has anyone encountered this yet?

                              <span>A few days back, I came across a setting to restrict user access to the administration portal. After checking, I realize how easily we let users access the organization&#x27;s information without any privileges. To make you all aware of this setting, I came up with a blog that includes the steps to restrict users&#x27; access to Azure AD data and PowerShell modules. But, I got a negative impact from a few Redditors saying that it is invalid and nothing can be changed with this setting as it is a directory.
 Though it is a directory, do non-admins really need to access the organization&#x27;s information? Even one single vulnerability can easily break the security chain nowadays. Isn&#x27;t it? But, the comments made me conclude that restricting user access is not as significant as other security measures. 
 But today, I came across an update from MS on the recent two zero-day vulnerability issues and the required mitigation steps. Their strong recommendation is to disable the non-admin access to the remote PowerShell module. Now, I have a question, Isn&#x27;t it necessary to restrict non-admins?

                              <span>Microsoft started disabling legacy auth in the tenants starting on October 1st. How many of you are fully prepared? I&#x27;ve been working for months and made a bunch of headway but I had the inevitable response of people burying their heads in the sand so now I&#x27;m waiting for this to hit our tenant. I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be flooded with calls about shit not working but I will remind them of the months of me chasing after them will no response. &quot;Start using Modern auth. If you need an app registration/enterprise application setup, contact your vendor, get instructions and I&#x27;ll be happy to set it up for. Until then, your shit application is broke. You were warned.&quot;

                              <span>Hi All
 Hope I&#x27;m in the correct subreddit. I just had an idea yesterday, hoping to confirm it here.
 My home only has copper cables (no fiber possible) which prevents me to subscribe to any internetplan above 100Mbit/s.
 I&#x27;ve been thinking of buying a 5G-Router which in my country/location achieves roughly 2Gbit/s down (I know that latency is different over 5G than Fiber but this is something I&#x27;m willing to accept). 
 The issue is, that 99% of routers I&#x27;ve seen don&#x27;t have a SFP port but only 1Gbit LAN-Ports and the ones that do have an SFP-Port cost more than 1600€.
 Now, my idea is to buy a 5G-Router like this one from MikroTik https://mikrotik.com/product/chateau_5g . I have a SuperMicro CSE-118 lying around with an Intel 340-T4 (Quad Port RJ45) and an Intel X520-DA2 (SFP+) in it which I would use as an pfSense Server.
 Would it be possible to connect 4 Ports of the 5G Router to the Server, link aggregate them, connect the SFP-Port to a switch, and distribute the whole possible bandwith of 2Gbit to other devices?
 This is just a rough idea and I haven&#x27;t thought about possible hickups (or none came to my mind thinking about this)
 Thank you all in advance!

I was looking to have some options of what to throw up there just to keep things fresh. I&#x27;ve been using NASA&#x27;s DSN feed but that can be stale sometimes. 
 What do you use, not twitter please, to keep things fresh and interesting?

                              <span>i have been a level 1 tech support with 4 years on experience, loving the job and the work but the management is not good in terms of staff management(favouritism, bad calls and never admitting it) and this day got an offering of Web SEO w WFH and increase of x2 of salary(eg. 2000 vs 5000), the only thing im not excited about is leaving my job description as a support/network engineer to doing webdev/seo stuff, but looking to leave my current company.. do you think i should stay and wait an offer relevant to sysadmin or take the offer ASAP? will taking the SEO affect my CV? because my first job was webdev for 1 year and shifted to sysadmin for 4 years which i enjoy doing technical/hands-on stuff.. whats your thoughts?

                              <span>Hello, I am looking for some advice here.
 In the company two new rooms have been dedicated to meetings and, silly me, I have proposed a opportunity that the presenter could have a tablet that can be connected to the TV and then they can draw on it, have their notes on it, and so on... 
 Now I need to find a setup that can work like that. Do you guys have any good suggestions to solve this?
 I was thinking maybe a Surface Go tablet with a pen that is domain joined then cast it to the display... Or a secondary touch display that people can connect to their laptop, and that is mirrored to the big screen...
 Please refrain from recommending anything from Apple, the Apple hate-boy culture is immens in the company.

                              <span>Hey Guys, I have been tasked with making a travel approval list, a list that an employee fills out then submits for approval. 
 It needs to be filled in by the user then send to management for approval and then send to finance to make the booking
 ​
 It seems you can set rules within lists but I can only seem to forward to to management and can&#x27;t add a rule to send to finance after
 ​
 My question is does anyone know of rules that I can use for this chain of events, or can anyone recommend an alternative system to using microsoft lists 
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>Background: Due to a contract issue, my organization decided to get rid of our HBSS platform that included host firewalls. I am now left with plain windows 10 home edition firewall as my only option with the same protection requirements. (Fucked situation I know). My network is isolated and only windows defender is approved so I can&#x27;t use a third party solution.
 My question is if there us some way to configure a learning mode for windows firewall that automatically creates rules? My old platform had that and it made for a good starting point. Any advice would be greatly helpful to an overstretched cybersecurity/net tech/server admin/ whatever I am in this organization.

                              <span>UK tech here, 2 years in. 
 I thought it would be nice and something I&#x27;ve wanted to do for a while by starting my own remote / support for some extra cash. 
 However, I want to ensure CYA is in place for obvious reasons and not sure what I&#x27;d need to do this being based in the UK - will I need insurance? 
 The services I want to offer are: 
 - Remote support (via TeamViewer for when a physical inspection / resolution is not needed) 
 - Backup / restoration of data 
 - Windows 10 / 11 installations 
 - L1 / L2 level of issues 
 - HDD / SSD upgrades 
 - Also thinking of smart tech support 
 I would buy my own domain and get this all setup but like I said, I just want to cover my ass before I start. 
 Also, how to properly handle sensitive data based on GDPR? Eg. how long to keep data after a backup has taken place? 
 TIA!

                              <span>I have a Static group of users in Group A. I want to split them into two further groups based on the first letter of their surnames.
 So for Group B my Dynamic Group Filter is: 
 user.memberof -any (group.objectId -in [&#x27;3e14ea14-84bf-429b-98e6-f2289dcced9c&#x27;]) - and (user.surname -match &quot;^[A-M]&quot;) 
 The syntax seems valid and I&#x27;m able to save, but it is populating Group B with ALL the users in Group A. It seems to be completely ignoring my user.surname filter.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>Yesterday, MSRC updated more information on the two zero-day vulnerability attacks on Exchange Server and required mitigation steps for customer guidance. Through the blog, besides various mitigations, their foremost recommendation is to disable the remote PowerShell access for non-admin users.
 https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/customer-guidance-for-reported-zero-day-vulnerabilities-in/ba-p/3641494
 Currently, we can see similar attacks made by tricky cybercriminals in almost every place, be it on-premise or the cloud. Every crime initiates with going over all the organization information to uncover the weakest links in the security chain to creep in their attack. Thus, their key target would be standard users, as getting their credentials using password spray or purchasing via cybercriminal economy becomes effortless.
 Few days back, I wrote a blog with the steps to restrict users&#x27; access to the Azure AD portal. When considering Office 365 environment, the organization info will be scattered and viewable through multiple places like Azure AD portal, PowerShell, MS Graph, etc.But, many Redditors commented it was invalid and unnecessary as it is a directory. 
 Though it is a directory and non-admins have access to it, do they really use portal.azure.com or PowerShell to view Azure information? Even a single loophole make the attack worse. Moreover, why shouldn&#x27;t we restrict them from accessing crucial information when we can do it? What&#x27;s the point in letting the weakest security link be active right before our eyes? Isn&#x27;t it essential to restrict them?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have 2,500 Windows devices in an educational environment that I want some proactive monitoring on.
 The type of monitoring I am looking for is:
  
Device has not been online in X days.
 Device keyboard/monitor/mouse unplugged for X days
 Device hard drive failing
 Service X not running
  
In all instances I am looking for an alert/email that can easily be ingested by Service Now so I can get an engineer sent out. 
 Does anybody have an experience with this?
 Thanks,
 Jason

We want static IP addresses (specific addresses, not random), either generated locally or through an external service, on a single server.

 Any advice, even just a finger in the right direction, is more than appreciated. You will be saving this stressed out volunteer a lot of time, maybe!

                              <span>Hi All. 
 Windows Server 2019 running as a VM on VMWare sporadically loses network connection. The icon goes to the yellow exclamation point, saying it has no internet and I am not even able to ping the networks&#x27; gateway address. The way to &quot;solve&quot; it is by disabling, and enabling the network device. This immediately brings up the network device again and I can ping everything. I have checked that the power settings will not put the device to sleep (which should any way wake up when I log in via the console) . I cannot find ANYTHING in event viewer (probably looking in the wrong place) that would indicate why this happens. There are no events/alarms in VMware either.
 I am at a loss and would appreciate any help I can get.

 I run it through the Windows PowerShell console. When I close the Windows Power Shell console, it stops.
 Is there a simple way for me to keep it running on the server machine?
 What should I be doing?
 I&#x27;m running Windows 2019 on a server.
 Can Windows Task Scheduler help to keep the script running ? What configuration I need to apply to continue running?

 I&#x27;m looking for a password manager for the company, and I&#x27;m not sure what to choose.
 We want users to be able to save their own passwords in the vault, as well as create some shared vaults for passwords for svc accounts, shared mailboxes etc.
 What would you recommend? Should we choose something open-source or paid?

I am subscribed personally to the specific vendor based ones but does anyone know of any good aggregates feeds/sources that has some light filtering (e.g. only display zero-day or remote exploitable CVEs)?

                              <span>Hi All,
 I&#x27;ve been using Microsoft TO Do to manage my tasks, but lately i havent been enjoying it. I mostly forget the daily tasks or reminders i set because i don&#x27;t get any notification. I have to open the app first and go through the submaps before i can see a task i set. 
 What makes me love it is that i can easily add a mail as task. 
 My question is what else do you use to manage your day-to-day tasks and is there any form of notification you can get when you set a reminder on a task? Does it also notify you what your tasks are for the day?
 ​
 Thanks for reading

                              <span>Hi,
 I feel like this has to be a common thing but a Google didn’t bring anything up; say someone needs to attach some large documents which might exceed the local or remote company’s e-mail limits. I guess people would usually use Dropbox, but is there any open source alternative?
 Preferably PHP/MySQL based, but anything that can run on a Ubuntu box. It doesn’t have to be secure or keep files for a long time.
 Any advice appreciated. Rgds,
 Chris

 I feel its a shame to send these off to get trashed and was looking about a good charity that takes working laptops; they&#x27;re in easily workable state, but lack the RAM required for our new users use so aren&#x27;t ever deployed

                              <span>Sysadmins of Reddit we are in need of some help because we feel like we are missing something simple...
 ​
 As of saturday all of the VM&#x27;s on a single Hyper-V host have lost the ability to connect to the internet. Nothing has changed, no updates, no nothing. Eventviewer seems to be clean.
 The Hyper-V host has internet connectivity and we can ping the VM&#x27;s from the host and from the VM&#x27;s to the host but that&#x27;s it. We have checked DNS (it never is DNS but everything in me is screaming it is...), LAN settings, everything... However we still cannot seem to find the issue.
 We even went as far to try and add google DNS or open DNS to one of the servers DNS server to no avail.
 ​
 Any pointers?
 ​
 EDIT (mostly for laughter)...: Router settings somehow got reset and was blasting DHCP over the network. This blocked everything. Turning DHCP off and restarting the servers solved everything. Still weird how nothing about this showed up in eventviewer.

We&#x27;ve got cloud computing and storage and yet some of our &quot;we&#x27;ve always done it this way&quot; people are holding the company back. We have long time employees emotionally and personally invested in hardware that&#x27;s past its prime but they are holding on tight.
 Cumbersome spreadsheet are everywhere and many of them working from different versions of similar data sources. Heard one manager describe a constantly manually updated slide as his dashboard. Caught one user printing out two different documents only to scan them back in to make one pdf.
 It will be my focus, my goal, my calling to drag us into the modern day.
 FYI: Financials are of slight concern. I think users are fearful of being automated out of work.

 visudo -f /etc/sudoers
 and exit out of that file it proceeds to open every file that&#x27;s getting #include&#x27;d.
 Is there a way to still use visudo but not go thru each included file?

 Usually I would rely on Wireshark, but with it being windows server core, not really sure what options there are.

                              <span>So, I&#x27;ve not worked with a lot of Network Teams directly, but I&#x27;m noticing they always seem to be very defensive and a bit isolationist with other departments.
 Is this a common theme everywhere? Or just a specific trend I&#x27;ve encountered? 
 If this is common, I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s because everybody is always quick to blame &quot;the network&quot; and spending half their time proving that the faults are in fact. Not a network problem. Which I understand, it&#x27;s just a frustrating when they get cagey, especially as once we&#x27;re off work topics they tend to open up and actually talk to you easily.

 Hope I am right in this subreddit. 
 I am searching for an alternative for ManageEngine DesktopCentral which is a RMM software which is free for 25 endpoints.
 All other software like datto, ninja rmm and stuff costs money since the first endpoint
 THanks for help :)

                              <span>Sys Admins of Reddit it’s been a year since I learned how to check the uptime on our company laptops. This year I learned that many help tickets come from users who go days, weeks, and months without restarting or shutting down their computers.
 Some insist they are shutting down, but the uptime logs states different. The high score I recorded so far is 135 days of uptime. I’ve had users complain they’re falling behind because of their computers performance speed. Users who don’t restart because restarting takes forever to boot. Users who insist they tried restarting multiple times before reaching out to the help desk. There are many examples but my favorite come from power users who try to resolve the problem without restarting thus making the issue more complex.
 I share with you all my journey of enlightenment. Though it may sound annoying, I love my career field.

                              <span>As someone said sub going downhill thought I&#x27;d post this? Anyone use the sysinternal? 
 I use them at work and they&#x27;ve always come in useful. While working I&#x27;ll sometimes put Mark Russinovich Case of the Uxexplained talks on and listen to them in background. Nearly all the time I&#x27;ll suddenly hear a bit I&#x27;ve never noticed before.
 Remember in the old company I was in we had a weird issue on laptops only. Still on XP (they were behind. Was in about 2012) The user would go to explorer and the laptops would freeze for about 5 mins. Then eventually the network drives would appear. I&#x27;d grab process monitor traces where I could but instead of giving me time to look our manager would say &quot;Just rebuild them. Don&#x27;t waste time&quot;. Rebuilding them was a cocking waste of time.
 Eventually her own laptop got hit with the issue just as she was going on leave. So convinced her to let me look at hers. Ran process monitor as it happened but couldn&#x27;t see anything obvious so ran process explorer. Just like in Task Manager you could see explorer at 50% but we all know task manager is useless. Looked into the explorer deeper with procexp and could see one .dll it was using running at 50%
 Ooo, could it be that? The .dll was being used by PGP the software we used to encrypt the laptops. Googled what the .dll did. All it did was scan the network looking for encrypted files so it could change their icon. We never used encrypted files so wasn&#x27;t needed &amp; apparently there were rare issues with it. So I unregistered it.
 Problem solved. Now instead of having to rebuild the laptops that took quite a while, I could fix them in under 5mins.
 I still take traces of issues wherever I can to look at them later. Started to build up a collection now and keep notes with the traces where I used the tools to fix issues.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working in IT since 2018. I&#x27;ve found that I don&#x27;t like talking to 2-3 dozen different people every day (I feel drained after talking to too many people). I want to work in the background and maintain things from a position where I don&#x27;t need to speak to anyone but my dept and maybe anyone I pass by on my way into work.
 I know there are other branches in the IT field, but I&#x27;m looking for something new to spark up my interest in IT again (my interest has been waning). 
 So my question: What are other branches of this field I can go into where I don&#x27;t need to be client-facing and answering the same six questions for eight hours a day? Or alternatively what are other fields where my knowledge/experience is transferable?

                              <span>Hello
 I&#x27;ve been following this sub for a while but I have never posted anything.
 I request the help of a good soul to understand :) 
 Let me detail the situation : I am currently building a game server with i9 10850k and I am looking for a motherboard. I have choosen one, the SuperMicro X12SCA-F (pictured here) but I have some questions about adding a 10 GB network card on it.
 I have already an ASUS NVMe PCIe x16 Card, which allows me to add up to 4 NVMe Drives (4 x 4 x 4 x 4 lanes) destined to be mounted on the first PCIe slot (X16).
 Consequently, the 2nd PCIe x16 slot will be disconnected. Which leaves me one PCIe x4 Slot.
 I have found this Intel x550 T1 PCIe 3 x4 that seems to be ok to pair with, but I have 2 questions before I click to buy it :
 1 – How will a NIC plugged on this slot affect the latency of my internet connection since it is linked to the MB chipset (PCH) and not directly to the CPU ?
 2 – Is this slot shared with the M.2 slot or anything else ? In other words, do I have to expect some troubles or bottleneck from using this slot for my purpose ?
 Thanks a lot for your reply!

                              <span>Hello there,
 I&#x27;m the proud owner (haha) of a VPS that I&#x27;m intending to use as a thin client to access my machines over the net. So far, after checking my options, I&#x27;m leaning towards a solution including a VPN (probably OpenVPN over Wireguard due to the firewalls), Guacamole, and a Let&#x27;s Encrypt autorenewal system to SSL&#x27; the whole thing.
 Process would be : connect machine A to VPN, use Guacamole on VPS, use VPN on VPS to connect to machine A.
 I&#x27;m now pondering what would be the best solution to handle this - and I like Docker quite a bit. So I&#x27;m asking here if there is a &quot;full solution&quot; already available for Docker (for what I searched, it&#x27;s always &quot;bits&quot; : either there is VPN + Guacamole, either Guacamole + LetsEncrypt, etc. but not the whole thing), if I should install it on the machine without Docker, or if I should make my own Dockerfile.
 This is considering I want to set up some OTP (at least) to guard the thing off.
 What do you guys think? What would you suggest? Is there something easier?
 ​
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I have recently got a new role as a Windows systems infrastructure administrator, and my first task is to find reliable software to register all assets in our data center in one centralized location ( such as CPUs - RAMs - HDDs - and their part and serial number in each host).
 ​
 and if we can access this software as web it would be better.

                              <span>Hello,
 apparently there is a function in the MS Office applications to send an email with the spreadsheet directly from the application (now I know it).
 Last month (a week after the August patches were applied) the first user from company A complains that this function does not work and an authentication window appears. -&gt; enter AD credentials -&gt; &quot;general error - restart microsoft excel&quot;, window appears again. Tried domain-netbios\username, username@domain-fqdn and username only. Since it&#x27;s not really a critical function, just dragging and dropping the file from File Manager into Outlook, I decided to put the ticket on hold until I have time to investigate.
 Today (Sunday) the 2nd manager of company B called me that this is not working, tried the same -&gt; no success.
 My findings so far:
 - All systems with issues are Windows 2016 Server with Office 2016 (sometimes 32 bit, sometimes 64 bit), September Windows and Office patches applied, both RDS farms and Citrix systems.
 - The issue may have been introduced with the August patches and has not been fixed with the September patches.
 - Sending an email from Word works fine, Outlook opens and the user can write their message.
 - it&#x27;s not user specific it&#x27;s maschine-wide
 - it seems that only customers with on prem exchange have problems, IMAP / POP seems fine, exchange online is not used by our customers, so i can&#x27;t test.
 - Googling was not really helpful -&gt; only old articles with reinstalling Office.
 ​
 Does anyone else have a similar problem? Anyone have any ideas ?
 ​
 Edit: All systems are fully OnPrem with also fully patched DCs; If I add an pop / imap account to the outlook profile and make it the default one everything works.

                              <span>So I have just spend a whole day trying (and failing) to implement an internal CA setup. One offline Root and one intermediary to issue certs. I was following one or two guides I found on the internet.
 Turns out, internet outdates way too quickly. A test cert I issued to a website got outright rejected by Google Chrome (with no option to move forward) despite having the whole cert chain imported to my system. 
 I ran a cert lint tool on the certs using online (https://crt.sh/lintcert) tool, and it spew out so many errors, I was questioning my ability as a sysadmin. 
 I won&#x27;t go into details of what the errors are since they are pointless at this stage. But stuff like mandatory Subject alternative names, and the abolishment of CNs, requirement for policy extensions, are some of the few things that have changed over the past few years, and none of the guides I used bothered to address any of this either.
 Hence, my question is, do any of you guys have a good reference guide that I can follow to create an internal CA the way the internet overlords intended in the current day and age, since apparently all the guides I have followed on the internet are all very much outdated. 
 And yes, I am aware I can bypass these warnings by manual adding to chrome, and using secret codes or whatever, but remember that this is going to be used in a real production environment so such work arounds are not a permanent solution. 
 P.S. For OpenSSL only please. I don&#x27;t want to touch Windows ADCS.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 Going to be implementing a Root CA with ICAs for a company network and need some advice.
 The Root CA will be offline (it will live within XCA) and the ICA will be a Windows Enterprise CA.
 The certs will mainly be issued for machine auth, smart card auth and simple https web servers.
 What are the best practices today with regards to key type and cert expiry? Is RSA-2048 enough? I was thinking of going EC (ed25519) but apparently this has compatibility problems.
 How long does my RCA and ICA expiry need to be?
 I&#x27;ve seen the occasional 99 year RCA expiry but that can&#x27;t be the right way to do things.
 I know that individual certs for websites can&#x27;t be more than 398 days, but how about the rest?
 Would love to hear what you guys are doing.
 Thank you so much!

 Wondering if anyone has come across a solution to Sign-out Disconnected Users on Workstations after specified amount of time eg 8 hours. 
 I work at a hospital where we have multiple Nurses/Doctors signing into multiple computers and not logging out after their done for the day and account lockouts are a problem when it comes time for password changes or forgotten passwords. 
 Unfortunately turning off &quot;switch user&quot; is not an option as much as I&#x27;d love to. 
 There is an option in group policy for this exact problem but it only exists for Remote Desktop Servers... Great.
 Policy for Reference:
 Computer Configuration&#x3D;&gt; Administrative Templates&#x3D;&gt;Windows Components&#x3D;&gt;Remote Desktop Services&#x3D;&gt;Remote Desktop Session Host&#x3D;&gt;Session Time Limits.
 ​
 Any input would be much appreciated, Cheers Legends

Mine updated on September 23rd and ever since then, I’m experiencing a CPU usage spike when I click on my start menu (windows 10) or when I view my hidden taskbar icons. I’m so confused as to why Trusteer has anything to do with my taskbar but I understand the overbearing bloat that it is. Don’t think I can afford to uninstall it at this point though

                              <span>Edit: Thank you for the replies. I will ask for a change to cat 6, (he can say yes or no, then it&#x27;s on him). They&#x27;re going to work stations mostly but I just added some meeting rooms, etc., unspecified what actual devices they&#x27;ll be using, assuming a PC per person. I&#x27;ll do 2 per workstation. Cost isn&#x27;t an issue as it&#x27;s fake and the budget is almost irrelevant, just need to justify the design. 
 I&#x27;m in a networking course and part of the class is to design a medium-sized business network. We have never covered the logistics of physically laying out cables, business standards, parts necessary, etc. yet all of this is required for the assignment. So I apologize for this low level question but I have 0 real-world experience. The assignment specifies cat5e.
 My question is, when running the cat5e cables out, is there a standard number of cables per destination (to rooms, workstations, etc.), or should it be exactly as many as needed? Is it 1:1 end component per cable (like if a room is expected to have 5 PCs, should there be 5 cat5s, extra? twice as many?)?
 I&#x27;ve tried googling this and watched videos of people but I still haven&#x27;t figured out a specific answer. I&#x27;ve read all the rules, I think this question is allowed. You don&#x27;t have to explain it like I&#x27;m 5, I just literally don&#x27;t know what real businesses do.

                              <span>I am trying to configure OSPF (using bird) to reach a subnet from a router that has no direct connection to the node with the subnet, something like this:
 https://i.imgur.com/s5Bkwhj.png
 The AS has two networks, but for testing purposes I am announcing them in different VMs,
 VM1 advertises fdad:23e:f50::/48
 VM2 advertises fdba:54:32::/48
 Between VM1 and VM2 I have a wireguard tunnel and can reach/ping the networks
 In VM3 I would like to use network fdba:54:32::2/64, I have a wireguad tunnel between VM2 and VM3 and I can ping/reach the IP&#x27;s.
 The problem I have is that from VM1 I can&#x27;t reach VM3 and viceversa, this is my ospf config:
 VM2 configuration:
 protocol ospf v3 wg6 { ipv6 { export all; }; area 0 { interface &quot;wg.4242421477&quot;; interface &quot;wg.stub&quot;; }; } 
 VM3 configuration
 protocol ospf v3 wg6 { ipv6 { export all; }; area 0 { interface &quot;wg.stub&quot;; interface &quot;ens192&quot;; }; } 
 From VM3 (the stub) This is the output of show route for the IP In VM1
 bird&gt; show route for fdad:23e:f50::1 Table master6: fdad:23e:f50::/48 unicast [wg6 17:35:44.984] E2 (150/20/10000) [217.160.50.77] via fe80::1:45:136:71:70 on wg.stub 
 How to use VM2 has the router between VM1 and VM2 ?

                              <span>I purchased a Sonicwall firewall and have a Cisco Go AP for our small business. I’m familiar with how networking works (intermediate, not an expert) and with each device. However, I’m having trouble connecting a separate WLAN (not a guest WiFi network) to my internal LAN. Can anyone offer any guidance?
 FYI - I created a virtual interface on the Sonicwall firewall with a VLAN tag. On the Cisco Go side, I created a non guest WiFi and assigned it the same VLAN tag. Still no connection. I must be missing something.

 Is Mobile-IP common? or it is just a less practical protocol?

 The more we discuss these issues, the faster they will (potentially) get resolved.
 So, what applications, processes, OSes, functions have you seen break/misbehave with IPv6?

Something I’ve been wanting to do recently is see if it might be possible to write a custom host-based IDS in Python to analyze capture files for “indicators of compromise”. I was wondering if there are any straightforward parsing methods I could apply to a capture file that might simulate an IDS but instead using Pyshark? Maybe I just need to look into Wireshark forensics and copy those techniques? I’m new to all of this so if I sound naive, it’s because I am. If this sounds ridiculous or infeasible please let me know.

 A monitoring program have been deployed in the ryu controller in order to capture the network traffic with two classes (normal and attack) .
 The monitored traffic has been saved in csv file and treated as a dataset in order to train a deep learning model for network traffic classification . 
 A One Dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (1D-CNN) model has been developed using tensorflow and keras. The trained model was saved as h5 file . My question is how to deploy or integrate the h5 model and run it inside the ryu controller .. I have tried to do the tensorflow integration in different ways but unfortunately I failed as I faced many difficulties in installing tensorflow and its supporting libraries inside the ryu controller. I would be greatful If you have any suggestions that lead to sort out the aforementioned issue.

                              <span>Hey hey!
 I run a tech software company where we have been using webmail built into shared Linux hosting for our clients.
 As you can imagine, the IPs are all on various blacklists and it&#x27;s getting difficult.
 I&#x27;m looking at setting up an AWS EC2 server to use as an email server for all my clients. Would love and appreciate any suggestions on how I should do this, which software I can use and if there&#x27;s a better option than EC2.
 We&#x27;re a small company so would like to keep costs low.
 Thank you

                              <span>So there will be a central server to which all the configured systems will send their system data which will be analyzed and displayed visually. This is the main goal of the project.
 ​
 What different data can be collected from a given computer system and represented as JSON to be sent to the central server periodically ?
 ​
 I&#x27;ve been able to come up with the following list till now:
 - Hostname
 - OS
 - OS version/kernel version
 - Total disk space
 - Available disk space
 - IP address
 - Open ports
 - Current running processes
 - Battery percentage
 - CPU utilization over the last &quot;x&quot; hours
 - Users
 ​
 What else can be added ? It&#x27;s for a group project and there are no fixed criteria

                              <span>Yes, I know... it was an old Drobo that I got from my previous workplace. Does anyone know if there is another vendor&#x27;s NAS that has the ability for me to just move the disks into their device and recover the array? If not it wasn&#x27;t the most important data in the world and I have cloud backups of the important stuff, but it&#x27;s quite a bit to download. 
 It&#x27;s a 5 bay Drobo 5N, so I&#x27;m looking to replace it as well. Something like a Synology or QNAP. Any suggestions? If someone tells me TrueNAS is a possibility I&#x27;ll do that as well, I&#x27;ve been looking for a reason to build a new server.

                              <span>Once an rsa token reaches its expiration date is their anyway to reactivate it? I currently work for defense contractor on non classified work and work remotely, but use my rsa token basically to login into my computer and rdp into different servers. I didn&#x27;t realize my rsa token expired yesterday. (Currently says off). I&#x27;m mainly concerned as I assume a new one will need be shipped to me. (Unsure the process or how long this will take just realized today it expired and wont be able reach out to it/support until monday). I was wondering if anyone had insights the process general and what should I expect terms timelines . (Know guidelines/timeleines range company to company but general ideas). Thanks in advance worried as approaching a deadline this week and don&#x27;t want be out of my labtop/company resources while I assume new rsa token will be shipped to me.

                              <span>One of my users said he got an email from himself, but the vanity part of the email was different. Had our company name but his email. It said it originated outside of our org. But the thing is, it literally was his email. I looked it up and down for things like using rn to spoof an m, but nothing was wrong with it. Anyone seen stuff like this?

                              <span>I have been working in IT for a while now, about 10 years ago I started my apprenticeship.
 And for the first time, I honestly feel like I am being paid what I am worth!
 I start Monday and it feels great, I have had a few roles in that time and each time I felt like I went for a “safe” role and when I started I soon realised that I could do a lot more than my job description. (Mainly think that is because some job job descriptions are far more broader than you actual responsibilities, if I saw SQL database, I would assume I needed to be a SME)
 Now I have gained some pretty desirable skills (such as PowerShell, Microsoft 365 expert, Cloud knowledge, etc) I went for a £50k role with no hesitation, it will be challenging but in a good way.
 And I feel like I will be far more motivated knowing I am getting a salary worth my knowledge, skills and experience.
 I also have been offered contract work on the side, which I’ve always felt IT was hard to side hustle.
 But my PowerShell and modern workplace knowledge has been very desirable as of late. All that training paid off!
 So this post is just to say… go for it, as long as you are willing and train when required, maybe that role your eyeing up will work for you.
 Wish me luck!

 Cisco is the only EDR I’ve had exposure to so I have nothing to compare to.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 Apologize in advance for my poor english skills, it is not my first language. However, I hope you could help with my issue:
 I have to update the company&#x27;s DC so I did set up a a new DC with Win2022 as secondary DC, joined to the AD forest, and make sure the replication of AD Sites and Services, DNS, and GPOs were fine. The old one is a Win2012, I kept both running for a while, until I had some free time to decommission the old one.
 Finally, today I did transfer all the FSMO roles to the secondary DC make it as primary, the old DC is hosting the DNS server as well, so I added the new DC to each Forward Lookup Zone FQDN and changed the DNS in the network settings pointing our AWS Route53 (which I don&#x27;t manage). At first, until the old DC was online and after I transferred the FSMO roles, all the clients and workspaces were able to resolve the new DC as DNS server, the group policies update correctly, everything looks fine. 
 Unfortunately, after I shut down the old DC, the new DC could not resolve out domain and lost the all the metadata it replicated before. Starting back the old DC resolved the issue, and everything went back to normal.
 Now I don&#x27;t know what exactly where the issue is, I suspect this is something to do with the DNS but I really don&#x27;t know what I missed.
 Thank you for your help!

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I hope all everyone is well.
 I started working for new company that is has more work done on SQL server administration. Mainly using Microsoft SQL. My job is more system administration side. 
 These area including installation &amp; upgrade, basic query, backup &amp; recovery, monitoring &amp; optimizing, and security.
 I have very little knowledge on it and would like to learn from beginning to administrate them. Can you let me know if you know any possible training focuses on these, I couldn&#x27;t find much quality reviewed based training on Udemy or YouTube.
 ​
 Thank you.

Now, ive done many in-place upgrades, but this is my first with a cluster. Is there anything I have to do besides the upgrade, such as drain or evict? the customer wants them done one at a time.
 Thanks in advance!

So we send an email on Monday reminding them it&#x27;s monthly patches on Thursday and if they need us not to reboot their system to let us know. Sent a reminder on Wednesday, and again Thursday morning.
 4:02 pm on Thursday I get an email &quot;can you skip me?&quot; bitch you&#x27;re lucky I&#x27;m even here. I apply patches on Thursday morning then I issue a reboot command for midnight, done and done. I almost let her workstation reboot anyway just for the late-ass email but I didn&#x27;t.

 Salary-wise, the promotion to Systems Integrator would pay slightly less, but it seems to be a somewhat higher paying position in general - so it could potentially be a better career path at least salary-wise down the line. With that said, the data on &#x27;Systems Integrator&#x27; salaries seems to be muddled, as there are completely different jobs with the same title.

                              <span>Hi Guys , 
 What do you do when you receive malware alert from one of your company workstation by antivirus alert server? 
 are you going to do manual scan by yourself ? or you do remote scan from the antivirus server ? 
 ​
 i am facing big problem here that my manager asking me to do a scan with 3 different sw&#x27;s ( malwarebytes , KVRT and Mcafee antivirus ) 
 this means that i have at least 5 pc&#x27;s every day to do the same process but i am really not convinced at all to do this .. this task should be automated ... at least to do remote scan from the antivirus portal .. that&#x27;s why we have a centralized system for antivirus ( Mcafee EPO ) .. but they are forcing me to do manual scan at every singe pc in the company while we have more than 500 computers in the company . 
 what is the correct process we have to follow ? or what is the process you are doing at your company ? 
 ​
 sorry for my bad English and i hope my question and my point understandable .

                              <span>So it seems that Lazarus has used a bunch of open source apps in order to inject malware into specific companies… Not being a cybersec guy myself I’m wondering the implications of such a widespread and involved attack for medium sized businesses and how one would be able to determine wether they are affected, how to completely remove the malware. 
 We used 3 of the mentioned open source compromised apps as of today.

At work I have photos that are taken everyday. Which needs to be copied from camera SD card to the Server. Then the photos needs to go to specific folders. Each photo has a number on them for example: &quot;job 77013 Dismantling&quot;.
 This work is very tedious and I&#x27;m looking for some automation ideas and what better way than to ask you guys. Let me know if u need more info. This might help your favourite noob (me) to be backed by the management. Do throw ideas please

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 We‘re currently moving to four new 2019 DCs and looking to move the FSMO roles next week. Just looking to see if there any gotcha’s when moving them. Or any role that’s more of a concern than others. 
 We currently have 2x 2012 servers and then the new 4x 2019. 
 Dcdiag is good on all DCs and repadmin is showing no issues. 
 Cheers,

 Maybe it&#x27;s just me, but no matter which manufacturer I approach at the moment, their &quot;specialists&quot; usually only know as much as I do. I feel like I&#x27;m stuck with Level 1 support, no matter how much money I spent. IT partners are becoming more and more incompetent and usually don&#x27;t know what they are selling anymore or it even works or is to set up. If I approach my colleagues and Google a topic/problem, I usually get a solution faster and don&#x27;t get as many false statements as from a &quot;certified partner&quot;. I like the open source idea more and more every day, it makes you even more independent. The former advantages of the global players are becoming more and more disadvantages. Are there any success stories on the net about how big companies are successfully implementing open source th…</span>

 Now I’m stuck trying to figure out how I can pull a report that shows which computers have checked in but do not have a recovery key available. I’ve looked at a few different sites and have been searching all day but keep coming up empty!
 Any suggestions on where to start or some guidance if you’ve dealt with this before will be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I’m helping troubleshoot a VoIP over Wi-Fi network with a HP Aruba 5406 core switch and about 12 Aruba switches (not sure the model) directly uplinked to the 5406.
 WiFi is Ruckus, about 250 APs. We’re not using tunnelling because of some issues with tunnelling.
 The issue we’re seeing is a drop of a couple of seconds whenever the handset roams from an AP connected to a switch to an AP connected on another switch. Roaming between APs on the same switch is fine.
 Has anyone here ever seen this issue? Is the 5406 that slow at updating its bridge forwarding table or is there some config/firmware issue?

 First, this user has the correct AD permissions and can access this server over the LAN. The RDP profile on her laptop, which has been rebuilt and verified, is mapped by IP to avoid DNS issues. The firewall policy allowing SSL-VPN users/traffic to the LAN has not changed. As well, I used a test account mirroring her account and can connect to the VPN, ping that DC and RDS server, and connect via RDP without issue. During testing, I at one point even got assigned the same IP she was getting assigned so it doesn&#x27;t look like any weird issues with that specific IP address or part of the SSL-VPN subnet.

                              <span>Good morning, okay so I have been a chef for 16 years. I have diplomas in culinary arts, personal nutrition, and a certificate in food operations. The pandemic pushed me out of the field but I&#x27;m also tired of food and beverage. Before that, I worked as a tier 2 tech support with yahoo. Now, I am a tier 3 tech support at a communications company. My question is, is there a test that I can take somewhere to help narrow down my path? I&#x27;m thinking of network admin, cyber security, or developer of some kind. I&#x27;m just trying to get the most rewarding career path, money wise. I spent too many years in culinary and got paid crap.

                              <span>Using Cisco IOS-XE routers. Is it possible to create a IPSEC tunnel with one side being completely dynamic with no FQDN, and one side being dynamic but using DDNS?
 I tried getting DMVPN Phase 1 to work but spoke still seemed to require a static IP for NHRP. 
 Am I trying to do something not possible or am I going about it the wrong way?

                              <span>I have just been doing networking for about a year, and have a decent understanding of VLANs. I was hoping someone could help me understand it on a larger scale though. Where all is a VLAN doing a push/pop through multiple hops? Does it have to do it at each hop, or can the trunk make it forward through a hop depending on configuration? The example im working with is through this network:
 Vlan 101.100 Nokia 7750 lag-2 &gt; Nokia 7250 IXR-E Port 13 &gt; Ciena 5142 Port 5&gt; Ciena 3916 port 1 &gt; CPE
 If someome could help explain through a network diagram they understand, with other MARs that would be fine also.

 I am working as a 1st line network engineer and recently applied for a 2nd line role within the company. I have already passed the first interview, second one is going to be the technical interview. They told me to prepare for BGP and OSPF questions. I have knowledge in both from my CCNA studies, but I have not dealt with them at work. Any tips/suggestions on what I should be looking at / preparing? Key troubleshooting areas for both? 
 Thanks

 I imagine the mega corporations of the world may have a usecase, but from SMB up to some of the largest enterprises - it seems like adding unnecessary complexity with basically no gains.
 Here in the UK its very, very rare I come across an entry to intermediate level network engineer who has done much with IPv6 - and in fact the only people I have worked with who can claim they have used it outside of their exams are people who have worked for carriers (where I agree knowing IPv6 is very important).

                              <span>Hi Folks, I&#x27;m deploying a pair of Fujitsu RX2530 servers with ESXi 7.0.3h, and everything goes fine until I enable the link aggregation on the switch.
 The customer has a Dell N3024 and has already a legacy VMware infrastructure connected to it using aggregation. Since his license is the Essentials Plus, it doesn&#x27;t support Distributed Virtual Switches, only Standard Virtual Switches then I&#x27;m not able to use LACP, only static link aggregation.
 I set up the balancing mode to IP hash-based, I&#x27;ve defined as active the 3 uplink interfaces on the virtual switch. As soon as I activate the aggregation, I&#x27;m unable to ping the management interface until I undo it. I also think it&#x27;s not a VLAN problem because the customer runs almost everything on the default VLAN. Is there some trick in Dell switches that needs to be done to the static link aggregation work properly with VMware? I&#x27;m asking it because we first tried to do the same configuration on a Dell PowerConnect 2824 and it also didn&#x27;t work, then we moved the connections for this other switch where his legacy infrastructure is connected, but it isn&#x27;t working also. Any ideas?
 Thanks in advance and have a nice weekend.

                              <span>I am not very familiar with this side of the world of networking, so looking for some suggestions. 
 I want to implement telemetry and also have the ability for a tool/software automatically create alerts to email out or create a ticket with our ticketing software, when a link goes down, or a device is unreachable, bandwidth saturation, etc. 
 Essentially, be as proactive as possible and not reactive. 
 I understand there’s most likely no all in one solution, but would something like OpenNMS achieve some or most of these things?
 Any suggestions would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hello Experts,
 I got a challenge with a new service of IPTV streaming source which is feeding from the access port of the provider&#x27;s switch. It is L2 port without any IP address.
 The requirement is to push this stream source to all buildings which are connected via various L3 switches running ComwareOS, ArubaOS, ArubaOS-CX and Cisco IOS. I don&#x27;t wanna use a single VLAN spanning across these buildings so I prefer to use a multicast routing protocol - pim dense mode.
 The problem is that how can I route multicast traffic from L2 VLAN to pim-dm protocol?! Can you please give me a suggestion/advice to archive this goal?

 What are the ramifications for renewing this thing? If I get the Enterprise Administrator cert, should I even worry about renewing the Messaging Administrator one or just let it go? Does it cost a lot for renewing? 
 I&#x27;ve only been in the industry for 2 years and I&#x27;m trying to transition to the systems/cloud administration side of things, helpdesk is far too easy, and I love working with Windows Server, Azure and 365 and was curious of anyone who perhaps has the MS100/101 cert how long is it valid for?

                              <span>We have about 80TB of NVME storage on a Windows Server (We chose Windows Server because we just weren&#x27;t able to get reliable &gt;10gbs transfers via TrueNAS or ProxMox or TrueNAS Scale over SMB to Windows 10 clients.)
 We are looking for a service that we can self-host all of our data, in place with a sync client for Mac and PC that lets you see virtual\files on demand. 
 Synology Drive Server is working for us now. But it requires maintaining a completely redundant copy of all of the data on a Synology NAS just to be able to serve the data over Synology Drive. We use Syncthing to keep our WindowsSynology in lock step and it&#x27;s working but it&#x27;s a fragile arrangement and requires redundant storage. 
 Sharepoint Server is the obvious choice for a cloud file server, however for just 8 users Sharepoint Server is $7,200/license + $150/user CAL &#x3D; $16,000 it&#x27;s from a cost perspective more expensive than buying a 250TB TrueNAS server and just doing the Syncthing dance.
 Resilio technologically looks great, but we only have 8 users and in order to get a Windows Server license you need at least 20 users which means we would be paying $200/mo. 
 OwnCloud and NextCloud offer exactly what we need, but back in 2017 they abandoned Windows. We could run them in a hypervisor, but then we&#x27;ll need to duplicate the data into the VM and double our storage. 
 Qsync in QuTScloud would let us host a QNAP OS image in Hyper-V for a reasonable price per year but would also require us to duplicate our storage in the VM which means double the costs for hard drives. 
 Is there someone I&#x27;m missing who works with Windows Server and doesn&#x27;t have crazy enterprise rates assuming that 80TB will only ever be needed by multinational corporations?

                              <span>I’m a Sysadmin at a fairly large company. Think 5k employees. I make in the mid 80’s but when I look up my job title on Glassdoor the range for my job title is 100k in my company. The reason I’m re evaluating my salary is because my senior Sysadmin is leaving and I’m going to be taking over his main job responsibility. So I’m trying to navigate this situation and I have a feeling that the company is going to try keeping me at the same pay level but I’m also not really sure how to approach this conversation.

 Artifactory looks incredible and we may be getting it soon. Would I just mount the ISO of an image, edit the internal files, and then commit it to Artifactory? I am familiar with STIGs and best practices. Do you have any advice/things I should consider before volunteering for this work?

                              <span>Gonna keep it short. I was offered a job at a salary, I counter offered for more, and they rescinded the offer. Is that normal? For them to rescind offer rather than them declining my counter offer and ask if I still want the job at the first salary? It just doesn&#x27;t seem right. 
 HR didn&#x27;t even notify me...I had to email asking for an update. And they just replied, &quot;it was denied.&#x27; Had to reply for more information, the reply was.. &quot;Job was rescinded.&quot; 
 This just seems like shady work by the HR employee.

                              <span>How do you handle documenting networks, computers and servers, configs and settings, users, etc?
 It&#x27;s often times a very big job and it can be hard to keep all documentation and journals up-to-date. I know I&#x27;ve had my fair share of out-of-date journals and documents for networks and environments that should probably have really clean journals.

                              <span>Embarrassing story but maybe someone could learn from my mistakes. Haven’t been in IT for too long and I am heading a small project to replace two drives in a customers server with larger ones. 
 I email our dell distributor and say hey let me get two 4TB drives for an R410. He sends them over and I pop them in the server. Get into the configuration utility and it isn’t recognizing the drives. It is showing the drives as failed. 
 I think that’s crazy that he sent me two failed drives but hey anything can happen. He sends me two more drives and boom those both say failed. At this point I get a supervisor involved after I try everything with the drives I can think of. 
 He takes one look at it and says, “Those are SAS drives and this server uses SATA. You got the wrong drives”
 Facepalm…….
 A quick google search reveals that you can use SATA with a SAS connector but not the other way around. A lesson I will never forget! 
 Luckily the customer wasn’t in a rush and my supervisor was cool about it besides laughing at me lol but I kinda deserve. Any other young inexperienced guys learn from my mistake on this one!!!

                              <span>Someone else is going to run into this request, and the vendor&#x27;s documentation is very frustrating. So here are some tips to help you along the way. 
 The Lexis Nexis has enabled support for modern auth in the Time Matters Exchange Sync tool, but in their article https://community.pclawtimematters.com/pclaw16/s/article/Exchange-Sync-ModernAuth
 they don&#x27;t give you any information on the API permissions required. Instead, they direct you to ask a Certified Partner. 
 I wish they just said &quot;The API needs to write/read the mailboxes using EWS with OAuth authentication&quot; or really any indication of the required function/permissions.
 ​
 So, if you&#x27;re trying to set this up: 
  
Install at least TM 16.6
 Create an Enterprise application in Azure, create a corresponding client secret
 Verify that OAuth2 is enabled for the tenant
 You need permissions for the API to Exchange Web Services using full_access_as_app
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/client-developer/exchange-web-services/how-to-authenticate-an-ews-application-by-using-oauth#configure-for-app-only-authentication
 Reconfigure the Exchange sync on the server with the API values and verify the connection
 
 Hope this saves someone else some time. I wasted too much effort on this today.

 That being said, who are the IT gods and why are they the IT gods? Can we all agree on them unofficially?

Nothing works... Reboot one of the endpoints... Works! Wait, now it doesn&#x27;t work. Oh okay everything is connected and happy! Oh wait, no it isn&#x27;t...
 After 2 hours of investigation, we find the customer purchased their own wireless router at some point and it was broadcasting DHCP on the same subnet as the new FW. I hate these people.

                              <span>For the most part, love my job, everything is great. Love the people, happy with the investment my company has in tech, seems like we are moving forward all the time…. Instead of some of the horror stories we see in this sub
 And then something happens, which throws a wrench into everything and makes me second guess everything. 
 Today that was me. I came to work, no-touch-Fridays and got through some tasks, and my nagios screen went red. Like…a lot of red.
 Came back about 2 minutes later…weird.
 About and hour later, same thing. This time I could see a pattern of what was down…a remote site and everything AFTER it went down. I called the site, no answer, which is normal sometimes people are not there. 
 I start logging into switches, seeing some Spanning Tree stuff in the logs, nothing too out of sorts. Sweating a bit, wondering wtf is going on…do I know spanning tree enough (does anyone?) whats going on here. 
 About another hour goes by and I finally get a callback. The site was moving furniture and powered everything down..including the ‘splitter’. The what? You don’t have a switch there. Turns out the people before me put in a 8 port switch and stuck it behind the desk. I look it up, its a smart-ish switch with spanning tree, and older than dirt. No documentation saying its there, or what its doing. But its powered back up and everything is working much better now. 
 Monday they get a new switch…but until then I need to calm down.

You didn&#x27;t know you needed to install this program on Monday? Your webcam was broken all week so you report it while you&#x27;re WFH on a Friday? You somehow just realized your monitor stopped working on WEDNESDAY?

                              <span>Today started out as a seemingly quite Friday. One of those nice and easy coast till the end of the day Friday’s. Until someone comes in your office and has to mention their desk phone and Ethernet isn’t working. We use POE sip phones in the office btw. Well what do you mean the phone isn’t working, is their no dial tone? No he says, the phone has no power at all. 
 This immediately peaked my interest with a small side of anxiety and dread as to what I might discover. So I walk over to that side of the office. We have a whole floor of a building and this was on the opposite side from my office. We have 3 core Poe switches on our side and have a fiber circuit running too a single 48 port poe switch. 
 Too make the long story short, the single Poe switch decided to kill itself. Luckily we got a few data only ports to work for the printers. Otherwise the marketing team would have murdered us. So not the end of the world, but I swear it’s always on a damn Friday. A few years ago we got hit with ransomeware towards the end of the day…on a Friday. That was fun.

                              <span>Hi all, Long time lurker here - 
 I&#x27;ve recently received an opportunity, and I&#x27;m not sure what to do with it. 
 I chanced into my IT role at my work, and it&#x27;s a government job with a pension at the end of it. The crew is great, and I have awesome work/life balance (which is why I joined in the first place). But, the pay stinks (I knew this going in, I had a 30% pay cut from my previous employer), even though we are in a union. 
 Received a call with our main vendor for our computer database system and are curious if I would like to join them for 2x my current pay (35k) (which isn&#x27;t a lot, I&#x27;m on food stamps) and the work would be remote. 
 My chief worry is the economy. Sure the job doesn&#x27;t pay well, but it&#x27;s secure. And I fear a possible recession. I see advice on this thread all the time that the best way to get a raise is to change jobs, but I&#x27;ve also been reading that now may not be a great time to do so. 
 And, I&#x27;m a loyal employee, loyal to a fault, which in the United States, I know conceptually, is a very bad thing to be, but I still feel emotionally that I&#x27;m betraying the trust of my coworkers and team. 
 I&#x27;m scared to even ask for more details on the job offer. I&#x27;m stressed now, due to my family finances, so I&#x27;m worried that I may make a rash move. 
 Sigh, any advice is appreciated.

Are there any modern alternatives to Autopilot + Intune for non-Microsoft shops? If I can avoid spinning up a set of new MS products to push our device deployment forward I&#x27;d like to.
 Just trying to see if there are alternate zero touch concepts that people are using, or is autopilot effectively unavoidable?
 Edit: for PC&#x27;s. We already use ABM and Jamf for Macs.

                              <span>TL;DR: Does anyone here working independently carry some kind of liability insurance? Like contractors, electricians, etc?
 I got a position in the company I&#x27;ve been in for the past decade, but still kept my LLC active for larger consulting jobs I get every now and then.
 I&#x27;ve been getting a few referrals for medical and dentistry practices, which involve HIPAA. Since there are no official definite guidelines for security standards (that I know of), there is a lot of price negotiation and options when I&#x27;m in the analysis and design phase. For instance, moving the server/network rack (which is currently a shelf and desk in the water/air pump closet without a locking door) into a lockable, secure cabinet.
 So, I&#x27;ve been wondering if anyone knows my liability exposure for any &quot;compromises&quot; I make in the design and if anyone has insurance for things like this, or something else.

                              <span>I&#x27;m the one man IT dept in our 50 person printing publishing company. We have an assessment questionnaire from a client. My blind spot is on the subject of &#x27;compliance&#x27;. The question is, what are &#x27;our policies and procedures to ensure compliance with applicable legislative, regulatory. and contractual requirements&#x27;. The only real concern that I can think of that pertains to us is Hipaa (due to customer data files). We have Hipaa covered. I&#x27;m not sure what policies/procedures we should have in place. Exchange online has a &#x27;Compliance Manager&#x27;. Does that play a role? Any guidance on getting written policies is greatly appreciated.

                              <span>So I keep reading about being federated and security federation but do not understand what it truly means. 
 Is this simply being connected to centralized Auth? Thanks!

                              <span>What is the relationship here?
 Does O365 have its own servers, or does it use Exchange Servers? Are any of these considered on-prem or cloud by default? 
 Just looking for clarity around these what and how these services work, thanks.

 I am not familiar with Sharepoint, but as a GA, can I download the file to test in Sandbox?
 Does Sharepoint contain the file or quarantine it so it doesn&#x27;t spread? Curious to know how other admins handle these alerts?

 We are moving away from scanning from desktop apps in favor of scan-to-email functionality (directly from printer panel) and we&#x27;ve come across a problem with our Canon MF411dw printers where we just can&#x27;t get a successful connection with M365 smtp servers (smtp.office365.com). We are using a dedicated M365 licensed account and configure it as a sender in all our MFP printers for scanning to email with smtp auth and TLS set as ON, port set to 587. When we scan and send an email we usually get one of two errors on our MF411:#806 (incorrect user/pass for shared folder/ftp)or#841 (incorrect or mismatched encryption algo).

 Rack rail part number is 0HD9VM.
 From what I can see it may be 0KY465 but it also may be 0WK693... Or it could be something third again.
 Does anyone have any way to find out what may work or how to help myself. Yes I have googled and it&#x27;s not clear...
 Thanks in advance, appreciate it

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m currently a sysadmin who has been approached by a head of another department offering me an opportunity to be one of his many project managers.
 He&#x27;s aware I have zero PM experience but must&#x27;ve heard good things about me, coupled with a good impression he has of Mr through the limited dealings we&#x27;ve had with each other.
 He&#x27;s told me he&#x27;s approached me because he thinks I&#x27;ve got the soft skills required to flourish in the role, and has assured me that I can be brought up to speed as a junior PM and I won&#x27;t be thrown in at the deep end.
 My salary would remain the same, he&#x27;s already done the ground work with upper management to ensure I wouldn&#x27;t get a paycut despite going from senior sysadmin to junior PM.
 The role itself sounds like something I&#x27;d enjoy and it seems a good opportunity I otherwise wouldn&#x27;t get to experience something completely different.
 Has anyone here made a similar switch, or have any thoughts? 
 I&#x27;m seriously considering it as I have some insider information that our PMs have a much higher earning potential in my org. Many of them earn more than my boss, so I already feel like I may be hitting the ceiling in this role as far as growth is concerned.
 My main concern would be my skills in this industry fading should I wish to return/end up disliking PM roles, but the fact the company will bring me up to speed and the earning potential is higher is making me think I should really consider this and take the (seemingly low) risk.
 Any input greatly appreciated! 
 Thanks all and have a great weekend.

                              <span>We buy a small number of high end servers a year (~£200k) from B********y, they are ok but have made a number of mistakes recently. Also they are a Windows shop and we are 100% Linux, so they test it on Windows, it works, then when I install Linux on it, it don&#x27;t work, and we have to spend a load of time getting it working. What I am looking for is a UK vendor who will test using Linux and preferably install linux according to our instructions - We are totally happy to pay them extra for doing this, as our time is worth a lot. We typically buy EPYC 7003 Milan servers, so that kind of thing.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 Today i have a problem with a dell r720xd server.
 To clarify: the hardware and software of this server have not been modified.
 I get a message that says &quot;Configuring memory&quot; I try rebooting from iDRAC and esxi boots fine. When it is working for a while I see the esxi turned off again in my monitoring and when I enter through the remote console I find the &quot;configuring memory&quot; again In IDRAC it tells me that all the hardware is fine without any apparent error in the logs.
 ​
 Anyone know what might be happening?

                              <span>The last year I&#x27;ve seen an increasing amount of spam originating from Gmail. I&#x27;ll go so far as to say Gmail appears like a haven for spammers. Since Gmail holds a huge chunk of the worlds email accounts/domains, I can&#x27;t resort to my standard blocklist approach, and spam is seeping through my other filters and ends up with users.
 I&#x27;ve tried reporting the spam to abuse accounts such as [abuse@gmail.com](mailto:abuse@gmail.com). That did nothing except get one of our mailservers on a gmail blocklist (lots of lost emails). (I can&#x27;t 100% guarantee there was a correlation, but the timeline fits very well..) I&#x27;ve tried to report through web forms as well, but most are focused towards spam coming into gmail from the outside.
 Does Gmail just don&#x27;t give a shit, or is there a way to get something done?

 We have a 4 machine DAG behind a load balancer running Exchange Server 2016 with all applicable patches. (Server 2016).

 Is there a way to mitigate New Microsoft Exchange Zero-Day through the F5 ?

 Is there a setting in Windows 10 that would block simultaneous VPN connections being allowed?
 If not I may need to dig in to anyConnect client &amp; see if it can be blocked from there.

                              <span>Hi all,
 So i have got a physical SCCM build which i now need to transfer to a virtual environment and create VDPs.I have started working and striping all physical related stuff and leave only the relevant.
 I have got assistance from a Citrix resource however i am not 100% sure they are telling me what the capabilities are and how we can do this optimally. Unfortunately i got no clue about Citrix.
 So we are going to build into the Virtual environment and that machine is gonna be captured and then fed into MCS and then clone it.
 What i am worried about is how do i transfer all the things i have stripped of the main build to the VDP build. For example specific languages. Can i have a PowerShell script run during MCS and do all that? 
 How do you guys go about this kind of challenges ?

                              <span>Hello,
 we have a small hyper-v cluster with six nodes. Whe setup the load distribution in hyper-v to aggressive. But some hosts have much higher load then others.
 I dont expect a great feature like in vmware with DRS, but a bit more equally nodes would be nice. Are there any 3rd party tools that move vms based on load in the cluster? Only app i know is SCVMM, but thats a quite big tool for such a small requirement.

                              <span>Hi All
 We had an elaborate phishing breach. Led to nothing but will lebaorate on what they did and I want advice of what else we can do, or even buy to help reduce. We are a MS 365 house
 ​
  
User in question is in finance.
 User was recently scammered personally.
 User was tricked (we suspect she may have been using same passwords for everything) to approve MFA. MFA was set as phone. The initial entry point we think they either had tested her password as got from the initial, non company scam or a phshing email pre Avanan being turned onto the max and slipped through MS quarantine.
 Scammer got in (using a IP on same country) and set a rule for correspondance on a &quot;shared finance mailbox&quot;
 2 weeks later...logged in and started correspondance with a cutsomer as set in the rule about bank details.
 Bank details were changed but we got altered and was started.
  
Shared mailbox had 13 plus people in so took me time as shared maiboxes dont have great auditing. Eventually located, blocked, changed passwords, altered MFA, coverted this mailbox to a licensed etc. The whole company is about to have all passwords changed and MFA sessions revoked.
 We already do:
  
Yearly training std
 Atleast 2, if not 3 fake phishing tests a year that lead to extra training
 We have Avanan in place since Sept. Note, was not placed inline till after the initial breach. 
 I block most countries hence how they go in via IP address in this country via a VPN
 Shed load of alerts on 365 but a a since instance, not sure any alert would have trigged unless I do alerts on any rules adding into a mailbox (we have 600+ mailboxes, rising to 2500 shortly.
  
Any AI solution that could help?
 Would EDR/XDR in any way?
 Move shared mailbox correspondances to helpdesk solution eg freshdesk?
 Open to comments as going to present to board what I need and why.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>we bought 2 S5850-24S2Q as a test to see if we can use them for the testing dev environment. been putting it through the paces with VSAN and it&#x27;s not bad if you are doing Basic L2, CLI is very Cisco-ish, had to modify my run books slightly to adjust for the changes nothing crazy. 
 Problems started when we started doing L3 routing + VXLAN and started loading up the switch with DAC cables when we started plugging in our Dev servers, and all our &quot;Servers&quot; (repurposed old workstations with 10GE cards). and started running Iperf 
 switches started locking up. Reboot is the only way to get it to respond. Disabling VXLAN fixes the issue. 
 We emailed the account manager and she got someone involved ASAP, they didn&#x27;t even ask for any logs or TSRs and said it was a memory leak and sent us a new firmware that fixed the problem, 
 The fact of the matter is I&#x27;ve seen and heard of similar issues with Cisco switches, and routers that cost a lot more, what are your thoughts on this? 
 Personally, I don&#x27;t think I will use this for prod or dev, and hope I can convince management to give me one so I can use it in my home lab :D.

 I&#x27;m just getting into this, just started school. I&#x27;m in &quot;Networking Fundamentals&quot; kind of new. I was set on security when I applied, I was obviously pretty naive. I liked the idea of defense and incident response. I didn&#x27;t know how much I didn&#x27;t know. Turns out it was everything and it was a real kick in the chest. I&#x27;ve been plugging along though. Good enough grades so far, but I&#x27;m still not sure that I&#x27;ve learned anything. It&#x27;s online so I feel pretty alone as I don&#x27;t know anyone in the industry so it&#x27;s not like I speak the words I&#x27;m trying to learn to anyone and it makes it seem so foreign and abstract. But I&#x27;m trying pretty hard. And I&#x27;ll keep doing that, but I&#x27;m pretty self-defeating so I&#x27;ll feel like shit about it and assume I&#x27;m the wo…</span>

                              <span>So I&#x27;m setting some new Dell R650 servers, a couple of PowerSwitch switches and a Power store SAN. The Dell switches are configured for L2 and have trunk port connections to some L3 Cisco switches. I haven&#x27;t worked with Dell equipment in years and my current employer has been an HP and Cisco shop in the past.
 So the servers have 2 dual 25GB port network cards, 1 port on each card is setup for Data and 1 port is setup for ISCSI/Vmotion/Vmanagement. I&#x27;m trying figure out when I should be using the VLT port channels with the connections.
 Should I use them for?
 1 - Two Data connections to each server
 2 - Two ISCSI/Vmotion/Vmanagement connections to each server
 3 - Two Trunk ports from the Dell switches to the Cisco L3 switches
 4 - For the Powerstore, it would seem like if you have only 1 connection per node, you would not use
 VLT? 
 Should I use two ports on each node and associate the two connections on each node with a VLT port channel?

                              <span>Curious what everyone&#x27;s SD-WAN solution of choice is. I&#x27;ve deployed both Fortigate and Silverpeak (Aruba EdgeConnect). 
 No complaints at all with EdgeConnect. Did everything I ever needed of it, simple enough to troubleshoot.
 ​
 Not a fan of Fortigate due to the fact it&#x27;s a firewall by nature - Hence asymmetric traffic is dropped unless asymroute is enabled which is a large security risk for organizations running a single device/VDOM (and with iBGP and ECMP there&#x27;s a lot of it during DR events....)
 ​
 So - What is everyones thoughts?

 I’ve applied to so many networking roles it’s insane. Most are entry - mid, my resume is well rounded. Is there something I’m missing ?

                              <span>I have a fairly simple, but spread out network, a few HP 1930 switches, and a remote office 100feet away (cant get cable there) via wireless bridge, and then another few HP switches. 
 Spanning tree is on, happy and has been for 12+ months. Guy in remote office was moving furniture and not only found an 8 port cisco switch plugged in (not documented by people before me) but unplugged the POE on the bridge. Whatever, right?
 My entire network hiccuped for a good 5-10 seconds. HP Switches show entry of ‘Unit 1 elected as new STP root’. Ok.
 So, for the fun of it, I had the guy unplug the Ethernet on the POE, just to see what happens…and sure enough, 4-8 pings drop on my entire network. 
 I would have thought nothing would have happened on my end of things (main office), but it did. I want to blame this old cisco SG250 switch, which I looked up and shows STP on out of the box. But Im not sure.
 Ive ordered up a new HP switch to replace it, and it should be here in a few days, but im just wondering what is going on and asking you guys for some insight if you have any. Thanks,

                              <span>I apologize if this has been asked before, but trying to search this topic I am finding a lot of results not exactly related to my questions that have been bothering me the past few days.
 I am having a difficult time comprehending the difference between untagged and &quot;no-untagged&quot; on an HP switch. I want to be sure I am understanding what the configuration means, and I&#x27;m not just continuing to copy what I see just because it works. I do understand how vlans and tagging work for forward traffic and separate it between different subnets. Something &quot;tagged&quot; for a vlan I understand fine. But when doing a show run on an HP switch, I am seeing the labels &quot;no untagged&quot; and &quot;untagged&quot; listed, and that is throwing me off. 
 When I see the words &quot;no untagged&quot; it makes me think that a port that is untagged cannot be part of this vlan (therefore only tagged ports can go here), and untagged means they are not part of that vlan. But then again, why would anyone need to specify a port is untagged? Wouldn&#x27;t it be implied it is untagged on that vlan unless it is manually tagged?
 Below is an example (keep in mind, I didn&#x27;t set these up):
 vlan 1
 name &quot;DEFAULT_VLAN&quot;
 no untagged 1-22,25-52
 untagged 23-24
 no ip address
 exit
 vlan 5
 name &quot;MGMT&quot;
 tagged 23-24
 exit
 vlan 9
 name &quot;PC&quot;
 untagged 1-2,4-10,12-15,18-22,26-40
 tagged 23-24
 no ip address
 exit
 vlan 10
 name &quot;DATA&quot;
 untagged 3,11,16-17,25,41-52
 tagged 1,23-24,28-40
 no ip address
 exit
 vlan 11
 name &quot;VOICE&quot;
 tagged 1,23-24,26-40
 no ip address
 exit
 vlan 12
 name &quot;SecWIFI&quot;
 tagged 23-24
 no ip address
 exit
 vlan 13
 name &quot;GuestWIFI&quot;
 tagged 23-24
 no ip address
 exit

                              <span>Is it best practice to land inside links from firewalls on our Cisco Nexus Core switches or land them on the Cisco ACI border leaves? Most traffic will be routed from the firewall into the fabric anyway.

                              <span>Hello,
 So I passed my CCNA in February and then got a decent Network Admin job right after. It&#x27;s insanely clear that the CCNA was not nearly enough to consider myself a good Network Admin and I&#x27;m learning stuff every day but I want to actually study things so I know it in advance or know topics better before I learn through screwing something up and having a higher level Network Admin save me.
 My job is almost purely in Cisco ASA, dealing with VPN troubleshooting. I decided to study a concentration exam in VPNs for CCNP but I&#x27;m noticing I still have issues understanding things like NAT/PAT and more advanced routing (not routing protocols, just routing in general). I feel I have a great deal of understanding in how these things work but once I start troubleshooting individual issues I become lost quickly.
 Are there any suggestions on study materials? Books or exams to go for, YouTube videos that helped you understand specific topics much better?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I am learning those by doing because I have to configure two VSX pairs of 8325 to power my current and a new datacenters. Fortunately I have some time for experimenting so I am trying to do things using all the new &amp; hot stuff. I need to have the same vlans accessible in both datacenters so I&#x27;ve configured evpn vxlan using ibgp and everything is working as expected except symmetric IRB with distributed gateways. The routing tables on both clusters show only connected routes while bgp evpn table seems to be OK. I would appreciate some tips.
 If someone wants to look at configs:
 DC1-CORE1
 DC1-CORE2
 DC2-CORE1
 DC2-CORE2
 and a diagram 
 For now I can ping over vlan 100 and 200 between DCs but not between vlans. As I learned until now routing should be done by EVPN Type 5 routes and the are visible on all switches.

                              <span>Hello,
 I have the option of purchasing a VPS with a 100Mbps connection and another with a 1Gbps connection. I’m creating an application that communicates with a fintech API and latency is key. So far, I have obtained a 1.2 ms latency to the target API’s server using the 100Mbps, which is ideal. However, I am wondering if latency is a good enough measurement or if there will be significant advantages of using the 1Gbps connection. Each payload is around 2Kb.
 Would there be a huge difference between the 100Mbps connection and the 1Gbps given that the ping latency is around 1.2ms on both?
 If there isn’t a significant difference, I’d rather pay for the 100Mbps VPS as it is substantially cheaper, and this is a personal project.

 Note: reason we don&#x27;t have a framework already in place is because our business growth is nominal.

 We have a 4 machine DAG behind a load balancer running Exchange Server 2016 with all applicable patches. (Server 2016).
 Is there a way to mitigate New Microsoft Exchange Zero-Day through the F5 ?

                              <span>Hi. One of our access points is no longer connecting to our network and I&#x27;m struggling to work out why. Initially I noticed there were a lot of CRC errors on the interface so we changed the cable which seemed to sort the problem. Now though, we have the same error again on the AP portal saying that the AP is unable to reach the cloud. I did a shut/no shut on the interface (which worked prior to changing the cable) but that hasn&#x27;t helped. The MAC address isn&#x27;t detected on the port to which it&#x27;s connected (Cisco switch) and I&#x27;ve tried pinging the but the interface was showing as up/up.
 I then noticed that the speed was 100Mb/s. I&#x27;ve changed that to 1000Mb/s but now the interface is showing as down/down and a shut/no shut isn&#x27;t bringing it up. All metrics on the interface look fine and nothing at all has changed in terms of configuration. Anything I have missed?

Essentially find out the list of devices the logs pass through to eventually reach the storage location, so I can create network/flow diagrams to help visualise that journey in case of a loss of logs to assist with contingency and remediation.

 I was looking at Bitwarden but would like to explore other products.

                              <span>Is anyone doing IPSec VPN&#x27;s over starlink? Site to site style?
 Currently trying to work a solution for a client, cisco platform all around - and best idea is to use IPSec VTI tunnels. This particular install is using Starlink business so we should get the public IP direct on the cisco, but we may have a need to do it on residential which is CGNAT stuff with dynamic IP&#x27;s .
 Whats the best solution here?
 I&#x27;ve previously tried l2tp VPN over residential starlink, and found the tunnel was limited to about ~30mbps, not sure if this was an unrelated issue, but other VPN&#x27;s to the same concentrator did not have any issues, so I thought perhaps starlink was PCQ the tunnel (seeing it as a single flow).
 Just keen to hear peoples experiences so I can push myself to the right solution.
 Thanks!

 I called ISP and it is not blocked by them, but whwn I try to enable that port in port forwarding on the comcast router i gwt an invalid IP range error saying it is not in the range of IPs. I have tried using the sonicwall ip as well as the cradlepoint IP (both are seen as connected devices and I pick them from the connected device list to try and do so). 
 In more detail, the way that things are set up is that they have a comcast business router, which is connected into the WAN port on a cradlepoint router I&#x27;m pretty sure but hard to tell since cable is routed through a big ceiling. The LAN of the cradlepoint is attached to phones on a VOIP box. There is a sonicwall that is connected to a hub that ha…</span>

 I tried to run debug ip dhcp server packet in order to determine vendor class identifier. But I only managed to find client ID in the debug logs. It has come to my knowledge that the vendor class identifier depends on the device that type that is getting connected to the ISP device. Is there a way I can know how to determine vendor class identifier for Cisco router ? I have tried to search for various forums and Cisco documents but reached a dead end.

 This isn&#x27;t the first time we&#x27;ve been without power and I&#x27;ve been here long enough to know what to do. Most of the office staff haven&#x27;t been here in a power blackout before and Jnr IT Helpdesk guy has only been here a month at his very first job so an office emergency like this has been a real eye opener for him.
 The generator powering the server room and some of the cubicles fired up automatically when the power dropped ( funnily enough we were planning to do a generator test tonight) so we got the staff redistributed to cubicles with power, set-up a few printers and everything is going along as well as can be expected at the moment.

 This was a roller coaster for me, this company acquired the company I worked for for 12 years, then let me go in less than a year. The official corporate story is &#x27;downsizing&#x27;. About 20 people got let go from a 300ish person company.

 More info as we get it - ETA: check in with Kevin Beaumont on the thread
 ETA: This may be ProxyShell rehashed ... if it is, fully patched environments should be good. If you are not fully patched (Cumulative Updates and Security Updates), this is as good a time as any to fix it

Now it is a scramble to find new coders and admins for the mainframe hardware as the current workers are retiring. IPv6 has been around for decades but pretty much every site and every company in the world still uses IPv4. 
 I&#x27;m thinking both will still be alive and well in 2040

 A routine request comes in, a fairly new user needs a piece of software so fire off an e-mail to the company for a quote and once I receive it, I send it over to operations and they call, reference the quote number, pay by credit card, we receive license information, and done deal. 
 However, this time was much different. It took them nearly a week to respond which is very unusual and the e-mail was basically a big &quot;FUCK YOU&quot;. No quote, informed they no longer sell the software, no longer allow software upgrade discounts, no longer offer phone sales/support (so no payment by phone) and told that all our existing perpetual licenses will end of life in March and will no longer be able to be activated/deactivated/transferred (for example, a user gets a new computer, can&#x27;t deactivate…</span>

                              <span>So at work we&#x27;ve been batting around the whole IPv6 chestnut, for the past year or so. We&#x27;ve gotten to the point that some of our providers don&#x27;t provide IPv4 anymore unless you cough up a bundle of money, so we want to go IPv6 only. 
 And that&#x27;s where the fun starts. So many external services we rely on don&#x27;t support IPv6. Github for one doesn&#x27;t. Docker&#x27;s registry doesn&#x27;t. Most of the CPAN mirrors (yeah, we use Perl in a few places) don&#x27;t. A lot of Ubuntu&#x27;s repository mirrors don&#x27;t. It&#x27;s actually easier to list the things that *do* support it than the things that don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s a sad and very small list. 
 So tell me, how to transit to a full IPv6 stack when 90% of external services flat out don&#x27;t support it, and (in Github&#x27;s case at any rate) don&#x27;t seem too interested in getting it to work?

                              <span>I have been tasked with the project of finding a new phone system for our offices (about 7 offices spread between 2 states, with about 90 desk extensions). This is being given to me as a bit of training on managing and implementing IT projects by my IT Director. He is giving me this project as a way to spread my wings and have an opportunity to make seeming in our company that I will &quot;own and manage&quot;, a system that will &quot;be by baby to care for&quot;. 
 ​
 This is something I haven&#x27;t had to do before, so I am just trying to get some advice on how to tackle a project like this. Not so much asking for phone system options (although I am open to recommendations), but rather tackling a large IT project in general. Any advice on breaking the project down, or standards for laying things out and planning? What programs do you use to layout plans? Resources for project planning?

                              <span>Hey all,
 This VPN is insanely slow (93.2% overhead) compared to connection speeds and I am having a hard time finding a reason why. Keep in mind I&#x27;m a junior sysadmin at best so I&#x27;ll try to include all the needed details while keeping them sanitized. 
 Quick run down: I have a ipsec site to site vpn between two networks with 1Gb duplex connections through two pfsense 7000 series firewall appliances. Connection is stable however iperf only shows a bandwidth of 68 Mbps with transfer capping out at 8.50 MBytes from two hyper-v vm on either side of the tunnel. File transfers from local to remote site are also very slow at 20Mbps. While these speeds may work for my use case temporarily I can&#x27;t help but feel I am missing something to speed this connection up.
 Steps I have taken to attempt to speed this up:
 Set MSS clamping to 1396 after calculating my OMSS. Sniffed before and after the changes and it fixed a fragmentation issue but speeds are unchanged. Using UDP over IPv4 for tunnel.
 Ensure there was no duplex mismatch on any NIC and no traffic shaping is in place.
 CPU&#x27;s are mostly idle and a combined usage of less then 15%
 Asynchronous Cryptography is on, compression is off, no rules conflict with traffic.
 Any thoughts? I am at a loss and about to attempt another VPN option in the mean time to see if I can get better speeds elsewhere.

 PS: if anyone has the latest Gen9 ProLiant Service Pack or DL380 bios/iLO files they can forward me, it would be appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve worked with my current employer for 4 years now as a sys admin. It was my first IT gig but there is a severe lack of directions, no room from growth, and lower than expected pay. I&#x27;m putting my down time to good use studying for cloud certs and personal projects on the side. With the impending doom of a recession and companies laying people off/hiring freeze would now be a good time to jump ship or stay put? I originally stayed this long due to work life balance to spend time with my kids.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to learn DSC and was using this quickstart by MS: Quickstart - Convert Group Policy into DSC - PowerShell | Microsoft Learn on a standalone VM.
 It uses the PS Module BaselineManagement to create an MOF and PSD1 file from GPO. The PSD1 script output by that process has all the HKLM registry changes under a &#x27;RegistryPolicyFile&#x27; type. When I apply the configuration to the VM, it modifies the local GPO Pol file and does a gpupdate, but not all the reg changes are made. No errors or issues, and DSC says its compliant.
 If I edit the PSD1 script by changing all the &#x27;RegistryPolicyFile&#x27; to &#x27;Registry&#x27; it actually makes the changes.
 Am I missing something here? Why isn&#x27;t the local pol file working? Should I be leaving the MOF to update the Pol file and troubleshoot local group policy, or should I be editing the script like I am and directly update the registry? Your insight would be appreciated!
 ​
 This is the setting I was troubleshooting. If the reg is present, the user can&#x27;t change the setting. If I use this as RegistryPolicyFile, the user can change the setting.
 RegistryPolicyFile &#x27;Registry(POL): HKLM:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\WarnOnBadCertRecving&#x27; { ValueName &#x3D; &#x27;WarnOnBadCertRecving&#x27; ValueData &#x3D; 1 ValueType &#x3D; &#x27;Dword&#x27; TargetType &#x3D; &#x27;ComputerConfiguration&#x27; Key &#x3D; &#x27;HKLM:\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings&#x27; }

 Anyone else? I spent years and years and years building my collection up, and now for the most part it just collects dust. And while I guess I should feel good about it, for some reason it kind of bums me out.

As .ics-calendar subscriptions aren&#x27;t working reliable (especially with Android and Google calendar) and a shared Exchange Online account is questionable in regard of licensing, I want to ask you, if you&#x27;ve got any further idea?
 Setting up an account for every user (about 30) isn&#x27;t my preferred solution, because we&#x27;re doing this for a club with limited free MS licenses…
 Thanks in advance for your help and ideas! :)

 ​
 What are some things I should be looking for to improve our posture?
 So far i have moved our endpoint protection to the cloud so we can push updates super easy. I also will be closing unused ports, checking our ACL&#x27;s, etc. But am curious what else I should be looking into.
 ​
 Any help is greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hi all
 Im struggling with an azure problem for a while now. I have a backup from a server in china that in the past (on different hardware) worked without issue. 
 We&#x27;ve made quite a few changes (none that i think should affect azure as it works on other remote sites without issue) 
 Any how- scenario is, I take a file backup to a azure vault, the backup fails almost immediately if not a few minutes into the job, LSASS on the server crashes forcing a reboot and the cycle repeats. 
 I have tried a different virtual server with the same data same issue. 
 I get an email from azure with this error - 
 The current operation failed due to an internal service error &quot;Authentication Failed&quot;. Please retry the operation after some time.
 Which i believe is simply because LSASS fails. 
 I&#x27;m looking for some guidance on where to pull a thread as im out of ideas.

                              <span>Just wanted to rant and to hear similar stories and how others handled it.
 In august, a new employee was onboarded to my company&#x27;s sister company.
 I was in charge of purchasing his assets.
 I called him and asked what laptop he wanted. 17&quot; he said, because of client visits and being able to have presentations on it when not being able to connect it to a bigger screen.
 Found a model, checked in with him and he said okay to said model.
 Not two hours after the purchase was complete, he called from a store and had seen another model that costed 1k more than the one he chose previously. He wanted that one instead. Informed him that the computer already has been shipped, and if he needed this one instead, he has to contact his manager and get it approved.
 His manager did not approve.
 Of course he needed a phone. No issue there. But he wanted a additional SIM. For his car.
 I obliged and sent him a extra SIM card.
 A couple of days ago he visited our office and had yet a request; he wants an iPad too. Informed him that he has to talk to his manager to get that approved.
 Today, he called. Now he wants another SIM. For his iPad (that I don&#x27;t know if his managers approval, if he bought it for himself or how he solved it).
 I told him No. Told him to make a hotspot on the iPhone and connect the iPad to said hotspot.
 Now, my manager told me that this guy has a purchase block.
 ​
 This guy&#x27;s audacity has no bounds.
 What similar experiences do you have?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve a need to setup a quick and dirty two camera CCTV system, so that employees can view the construction work happening at a new building being fitted out (which will take a few months to complete).
 The ad-hoc Internet access is easy, I&#x27;ll use a Teltonika RUT241 and a fixed IP data SIM from a mobile network, but I&#x27;m stumped on a camera to use (this not being a full on CCTV system with say Milestone and Hikvison bullet cameras).
 Can anyone recommend a CCTV camera available retail I can use for the above that...
  
Uses Wi-Fi for its network connectivity.
 Has a stream over HTTP so that I can publish this on a port on the fixed IP.
 Can have a low frame rate set, maybe as low as 1 to 5 fps, so that I don&#x27;t chew through data.
  
... thank you :)

                              <span>We have Windows 10 Ent tablets that need to sit upside down because they have a scanner on the back of them that faces up (down when your turn them upside down) and I would like to lock the screen into landscape (flipped) and lock the rotation from rotating. 
 I just want to confirm what I found is the only way and that there is no GPO setting? 
 To lock the screen setup:
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers\Configuration 
 There you will see every monitor you&#x27;ve connected so far, so open all of them. You will find a folder labeled &quot;00&quot;. Open them also and you will also find a sub-folder also named &quot;00&quot; (remember, for every monitor there will be this kind of folder and sub-folder)
 Search for the key labeled &quot;Rotation&quot; and you will notice it has it&#x27;s data set to 1 which it&#x27;s the default. Below you may see the data related to the corresponding screen orientation:
 1 &#x3D; Landscape
 2 &#x3D; Portrait
 3 &#x3D; Landscape (flipped)
 4 &#x3D; Portrait (flipped) 
 Auto rotation: 
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\AutoRotation 
 Enable DWORD 
 0 &#x3D; On
 1 &#x3D; Off

                              <span>With Shift Left, the importance of moving security earlier in the development cycle is clear. But do developers really care about building secure software? Or is this just something boring?
 Also, curious to learn how developers face security in their day-to-day. Any specific checklist, methodology, or good practice? What developer-first security tools are being used out there?

                              <span>Had to go into a Police Department last night at 10PM as a K9 car had no internet. It isn&#x27;t easy for them to just use another car.
 They had been on vacation for 2 weeks, they weren&#x27;t pingable, and I couldn&#x27;t even see their car on Netcloud or their MDT on my RMM.
 Got there and the Cradlepoint was handling out its default subnet, couldn&#x27;t ping through it, and I couldn&#x27;t get into the unit as it appeared to be factory reset. Had to spend an unreasonable amount of time dismounting it to find the default on the rear of it.
 Logged in and I was greeted with a subscription expiration.
 Cradlepoint will reset your device to factory defaults, and NOT PASS ANY TRAFFIC OF ANY SORT without a subscription.
 I heard this had happened a few firmware versions ago.
 But, WE WERE CURRENT and had been for years! It was a licensing issue on their side that just randomly took a license away from it, no notice of any sort, no indication on the main screen.
 Beyond unacceptable and will be replacing all of them next year. Sierra&#x27;s Netcloud is a little lacking for templating, but I will absolutely not have a mission critical device stop working entirely, requiring an on-site visit to find out a fucking subscription issue for a router. I&#x27;m sure folks on Meraki are familiar with this, but I&#x27;m not doing it for infrastructure.

                              <span>So we get a choice of 2 monitors or an ultrawide curved monitor. For most of my career, I&#x27;ve used 2 monitors and have always been happy with that setup. I&#x27;ve tried 3 and didn&#x27;t like it. Limped by with one monitor that&#x27;s brutal. I&#x27;ve never really used ultra wides but looks interesting and might be good if it is wide enough to have docs side by side with no bezel on the middle.
 Anyone like them?

                              <span>Hi,
 Sorry for the bad english, baguette here.
 So, with all this home office stuff going on, I have to find a way to let a new user log in to a computer at home. Right now I have to connect to windows using their account while in the office and connected to the company network. Not great.
 I saw that you could connect to windows using the Azure AD account but I don&#x27;t understand where to start to allow this in my company.
 Do I have to migrate everything to azure AD and stop using my on-prem AD ? Can I configure it using Azure AD connect without touching my current AD infrastucture ? Like I said, I find a lot of documentation about all of this but I don&#x27;t understand where to start exactly and it&#x27;s driving me nuts.

                              <span>im getting 10 laptops from client side and the requests were to create a local account with admin access so i went with this. (remote)
 @echo off net user &quot;username&quot; &quot;password&quot; /add WMIC USERACCOUNT WHERE &quot;Name&#x3D;&#x27;Alexa&#x27;&quot; SET PasswordExpires&#x3D;FALSE net user administrator /active:yes 
 i have to customize it for each and every laptop with a name but makes its easier.
 and i have some laptops that are running slow and out of storage so, ill have check them via teamviewer, also i found this script that removes junk/temp files
 @echo off if not &quot;%1&quot; &#x3D;&#x3D; &quot;max&quot; start /MAX cmd /c %0 max &amp; exit/b echo. echo Cleaning system junk files, please wait . . . echo. del /f /s /q %systemdrive%\*.tmp del /f /s /q %systemdrive%\*._mp del /f /s /q %systemdrive%\*.log del /f /s /q %systemdrive%\*.gid del /f /s /q %systemdrive%\*.chk del /f /s /q %systemdrive%\*.old del /f /s /q %systemdrive%\recycled\*.* del /f /s /q %windir%\*.bak del /f /s /q %windir%\prefetch\*.* rd /s /q %windir%\temp &amp; md %windir%\temp del /f /q %userprofile%\cookies\*.* del /f /q %userprofile%\recent\*.* del /f /s /q “%userprofile%\Local Settings\Temporary Internet Files\*.*” del /f /s /q “%userprofile%\Local Settings\Temp\*.*” del /f /s /q “%userprofile%\recent\*.*” echo. echo Junk files clean is finished! echo. &amp; pause 
 is it best if i go through them 1 by 1 or just automate those process?
 so what do u think? should i use these? or go though each and eveyone and do it manually?

 ​
 I am trying to write a script, or find a way that will test the connection between my VM at the data center.
 Then, I need to get the result value and set an action depending on the result.
 ​
 So, anyone can help to get this script?

                              <span>Which on-premise email solution would you recommend in 2022 to send transactional emails?
 Our use case:
  
send 100k+ transactional emails (register, password, etc) per month
 support SPF, DKIM and DMARC to not get blocked
 use SMTP or HTTP API to send emails
 store a copy of the outgoing email if delivered successful
 receive response emails (fail-after-delivery, out-of-office, manual replies)
 less moving parts (happy to just store emails in files)
 optional: POP/IMAP to access sent and received emails
  
No, I do not want to use an external service, I want it on-premise.

                              <span>Sorry for the format, I’m on my phone. 
 I recently joined a school where they have a bunch of these smartboards. 
 Student have been opening up inappropriate content on the smartboards and I was looking for a way to have it locked once the teacher leaves the classroom. 
 I know they support USB key unlocking but I am also exploring other suggestions/solutions. 
 1- All staff have RFID cards for elevator access. Is it possible to use the same cards to lock/unlock the smartboards?
 2- Is there a way to have the smartboard only be functioning/unlocked as long the USB key is plugged? (Like a car’s ignition)
 3- They have Android on the devices with some of them linked to a Mini PC for extra usability/functionality (Windows)
 Thanks

                              <span>Good morning, I am after so help with a little project i have been tasked to do. As always it needs to be done on the cheap. 
 We need to allow multiple end users, take a photo and upload it to only their specific user folder which they have access to. So I&#x27;m thinking a cloud based storage product where i just pay for how much storage i want rather than by user (as that is where it gets expensive, be about 150 users). That product would sync to on-prem AD. The users would log into the app with their domain user/pass and then only be able to see the one folder in the cloud storage product which they have access too where they can simply just add a photo.
 I presume this is quite a easy task but if anyone has any recommendations that would be fantastic.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello,
 We print using a print server that currently has about 30 printers which is all working perfectly... Except one printer. If you send a print job to that printer it will not print until I log onto to the print server and manually restart the print spooler service. It says the printer is offline but it is not, I can connect to it on the right ports from both my PC and the Print server.
 Has anyone seen this before?

 I work for an SME that has a marketing department which I&#x27;d describe as... lackluster. Anyway, they deal with our company websites, branding and (soon to be) ecommerce offerings, however they&#x27;ve not been happy with our current webhost and so they&#x27;ve commissioned another company to start building new branding and new websites along with an ecommerce shop on the side. Once it&#x27;s done they&#x27;d like to serve notice to the current provider and move from the old websites to the new 
 For some reason this is where I come in - basically they don&#x27;t really know what website domains we own and they want information and advice on how we can move all our currently owned domains over to one single provider (likely the new web host) so that we can also then bring the new sites …</span>

                              <span>In case it matters: The region is The Netherlands, Europe.
 About 5,5 years ago I started my IT career fresh out of school. I didn&#x27;t know anything and learned everything on the go starting with level 1 servicedesk at a ~25-man MSP. Over the past years I managed to step up and implement/solve more complex stuff. I went from rookie to network engineer configuring routers, firewalls and switches in complex setups. On the side I also was &quot;un-official&quot; teamlead of support by now. Teaching the new guys the ropes - I was the go to guy for most people to come to who were at our office. It became taxing on me: The workload was high and this made the place unsociable. The mandatory on-call shifts (one full week every 6 weeks on average) were very busy too, often clocking 4-8 additional hours outside of regular times. On top of that the pay was bad too, fairly below market average for a lot of employees on the team (people talked about it which management did not like of course, berating those who discussed it).
 Upcoming Monday I am starting a new job, I am leaving the MSP world and starting as a sysadmin at a company with about 85 employees. Working 36 hours (49) for about the same pay I got when working 40 hours (58). There is one other sysadmin who has been there for about 8 years now and the focus of the company is software development for a webservice they are hosting.
 The reason I am posting this is to gather input of other people who have made the same switch, how did life change for you? Did you run into surprises, is there any advice I should hear?
 Any input/advice is greatly appreciated. Thanks a lot.

 Let&#x27;s say I have a big bloaty ps1 file I want to split up. However, I don&#x27;t want to declare $vars in every file - just the parent one.
 How do I pass those $vars to the new script? Or... am I crazy and this already happens if it spawns from a parent script?

                              <span>I keep having this predicament with job applications. I have around 4 years experience in first line support but for very unique roles where I was pretty much the one and only go to IT guy who did everything so in reality I have more experience than my CV shows apart from that I have so much training in different technologies it&#x27;s hard to cram in a CV.
 Now the problem I having it&#x27;s that I&#x27;m trying to move from first line to second line support but recruiters keep telling me I might not have the experience to make the jump but then when I apply for any first line position they tell me I&#x27;m over qualified and they are afraid of me leaving after a short time. 
 After rejecting my application one of the interviews email the below to me as one of the reasons for my rejection: 
 &quot;We liked your example of the achievement you are most proud of, you clearly have a solid ‘second line’ skill set, and your response at the end about what you could offer also came across well.&quot;
 Not to mention they actually said it during the interview which gave me a good hint I wasn&#x27;t going to be selected.
 What can I do or say to first get through recruiters that doubt my experience and second show the company I have the skills and training for second line? 
 By the way in my are the jump in salary from first line to second line could be something from 22K to 38K.

                              <span>I got an alert from my Barracuda appliance around 10:48PM CST saying my queue exceeded the threshold I set. Ah oh, mail wasn’t getting to my Exchange boxes. So I did all the usual troubleshooting and internally everything was fine. External email was getting to the Barracuda ok but not being delivered to exchange. All “tests” passed and the Barracuda could send me test emails. I also discovered if I re-queued a message it would go back to deferred but if I skipped the scan engine and just flat out deliver it, the mail would show up… Must be something with email scanning so I reboot the appliance. That doesn’t fix it so I call Barracuda and open a case. The tech said he’s been doing it these calls all night. They pushed out a bad update and I locked up a scanning engine service. A reboot doesn’t clear it. I had to start up the troubleshooting remote connection so the tech could push out an update and restart the service. I couldn’t have done it myself as they lock that ability behind support.
 TLDR: If you’re having trouble with external emails getting stuck in the queue on your Barracuda after Wednesday night, then call support. They pushed a bad update.

 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone out there is having users use passwordless authentication for Office 365 and not providing any password to the user. As in, getting the user setup with a basic password, setting up the authenticator and phone sign in, then changing the password to something random and just having the user use phone sign in with MFA policies. 
 Has this worked out at all for you? We seem to be considering this after the uber/rockstar hacks + some other issues on our side.

                              <span>TL,DR at end.
 I used to work in IT as a sysadmin/net admin/architect, but no longer due to medical stuff (been out of the game about 5 years now).
 For the last 20 years or so of my career, I worked in consulting shops before there were MSP&#x27;s, and then MSP&#x27;s until my career came to an end.
 The shops I worked in were focused on the SMB space, and ranged in industry from manufacturing, oil and gas (upstream and downstream), construction, medical, legal, service, hospitality, retail and even IT dev operations and data centers.
 Sitting this evening and thinking about my previous life, I remembered a surprising and troubling realization I made about 8-10 years in, and wondered if anyone else found this to be true:
 The vast majority of the clients I worked for had incredible dysfunction to o…</span>

                              <span>So, after 9 years of being a help desk dipshit I have just started at a company where I am now the sole IT guy and they haven&#x27;t had one before. The guy who was doing anything with tech is my manager, the director of operations. There&#x27;s a couple of people who have slapped together some scripts, and my manager&#x27;s experience is somewhere around &quot;has built a gaming PC&quot;. They use an MSP for managing anything that&#x27;s above my manager&#x27;s capacity and my job is to bring that in house.
 Honestly I&#x27;m really liking it. It&#x27;s a small company of around 60 users and I&#x27;ve got a whole list of projects to accomplish and I&#x27;ve added a couple of my own ideas to the list, I think I can really tighten things up and get them running a bit more smoothly, get some disaster recovery procedures in place, etc. I&#x27;m feeling strangely confident in my ability to do what is being asked of me. That&#x27;s not what I&#x27;m here for today.
 I&#x27;m only a few weeks in and this company hasn&#x27;t really had an actual IT guy before, they&#x27;ve just had Chad the Ops Guy calling vendors. So, in order to help ease myself into a company that has a few decades of experience running but zero experience having an actual IT guy I want to do some user training of sorts. I want to do a sort of informal getting to know you and you getting to know me and what I can do with the title and theme being the title of this post.
 I have a few ideas for what sort of stuff goes in there, but I&#x27;d love to have your input. Folks who have started at small companies that haven&#x27;t had IT people before them, what are the weird growing pains as companies get used to your presence? What won&#x27;t the company expect about what my position brings to the table? I&#x27;m looking to bring some funny too, I figure anytime you&#x27;re asking the users to change If you can make them laugh a little while you do it then it goes over better.

 Backstory: I asked an older accountant (probably 50 or 60 year old) if he knows what web browser he is using and got the above response.
 My immediate thought was to fire back and say that he&#x27;s been in the industry long enough and probably been using a computer everyday for the last 20 years to do his job.

                              <span>I looked at the ospf database of a boundary router in a single area today (a pretty big area). I don&#x27;t have access to anything beyond the boundary which goes to some other campus.
 The database had 3 sections with routes. Type 1, type 2, and type 5. So I looked at one of the /25 networks being advertised as a type 5 lsa and saw the the advertising router, the boundary I was one, was hosting that /25 SVI itself! That&#x27;s where I got confused since the side of the network I could see is area 0. 
 I&#x27;m a visual learner and couldn&#x27;t picture where those type 5s were going and why they exist. Could someone explain this scenario to me?

 In option 54, the cisco interface address, not the dhcp server address
 Configuration example:
 ip dhcp relay information option no ip dhcp relay information check ip dhcp relay information trust-all ! ip dhcp snooping information option allow-untrusted no ip dhcp snooping information option ip dhcp snooping 
 What kind of functionality does this? Where can I read more about this ?

We have Palo Alto 3220 firewalls and are trying to get 2 fiber connections to work. 2 x 1G dia fiber connections from 2 different ISP’s. We are not certain the issue is the transceivers, but we are leaning that direction. No link lights on the ports, etc. We have tickets out with both ISP&#x27;s and hope to have answers soon.
 We have 2 different SFP transceivers and both act the same way. 1 type is generic from Amazon that was supposed to work with most major hardware providers. We brought them along as backups. The primary module is from FS.com and is supposed be PA compatible and has the PA designation like we expected.
 Does anyone in the Phoenix area have any Palo Alto compatible Singlemode 1310nm LX/LR - 10km transceivers with LC connectors? We would need them asap, our flights leave 5pm phoenix time on Friday 9/30.
 Does anyone have any other ideas or access to a vendor in the area that could help?

                              <span>Hello,
 Apologies in advance for being pretty new to networking.
 My situation is as the title states.
 How I got here was we are preparing for a merger and we were asked to add the DNS suffixes to the dns search list of our two source domains and our Target domain via GPO
 Doing this seems to cause the primary DNS suffix to be the first one in that search list
 To try and get around that I tried to define the primary as what it should be per domain.
 But after doing that, DNS only seems to be working with FQDN.
 Not sure what is causing this but if anyone has any input I would want to hear it. Thank you!

                              <span>So I just had to work an incident where some VOIP phones stopped working. I get on the local router and switch and notice I can&#x27;t ping the call manager. I check the routing table and I see the route to the subnet the call manager sits in right but there is also a /32 route for the call manager coming from NHRP, we do use DMVPN. 
 Visual with made up IPs
 B 192.168.2.0/24 via 172.16.16.10
 H 192.168.2.10/32 via 172.16.16.2
 So in this example the 172.16.16.10 is the dmvpn address of the call center&#x27;s router and 172.16.16.2 is the dmvpn address of a secondary headend. 
 Now yes there is also a problem with why the secondary headend we are standing up doesn&#x27;t have a route to the call center itself, making this just inefficient routing not broken, but I&#x27;m mostly confused by how NHRP just decided to advertise a route to a somewhat random server. I just threw a static route in to fix it for now but I would like to figure out the cause.
 This is my first time working at a company with DMVPN so I&#x27;m still learning the ins and outs.
 Thanks

                              <span>Does anyone have in/direct knowledge of what networking hardware platforms (cores, switching at all levels, wireless APs and wireless infrastructure vendors) these major firms employ?
 Separately, I’m looking for a listing of the major tech companies and their networking infrastructure/wireless/security platforms and vendors. Not sure if that is public anywhere.
 Thanks!

I&#x27;m going to buy some optics for a new nic and I&#x27;m unsure what &quot;brand&quot; of FS optics would be compatible. Anybody have first hand experience? I&#x27;ve had no issues with FS &quot;Cisco&quot; optics in the past in the switches, just not sure how the nic would respond to using these same optics.
 I&#x27;ve reached out to FS to see if they have advice, have heard nothing back yet.

                              <span>Trying to see if this is even possible what&#x27;s being asked. We&#x27;re wanting to set up some VM hosts at a separate site to replicate to for failover so if Site 1 goes down then we can continue to use our VMs at Site 2. These sites are connected via a layer 3 fiber link. Currently the VM hosts and the VMs themselves are all on the same subnet/vlan. Is there a way to recreate that subnet at site 2 or would they conflict with one another since the two sites are still technically connected?

Its wan port is connected to a lan port on router A an assigned an adresse from the first network (192.168.1.0). The lan port of router B are configured to be from the second network (192.168.1.32) and one of its lan port is connected to a lan port of router A. All device in the second network (192.168.1.32) are configured with a default gateway to be router B. Does anyone in all subnet will be able to see everyone across each network? If no, how can i achieve that?

                              <span>Pretty new to the profession, but have worked on network racks before. I&#x27;m building one from scratch for the first time though. Have ~200 cables coming in through a drop in the ceiling, and trying to decided on the best way to feed them into the patch panels.
 Is it better to have all the cables drop to the bottom of the rack, and then come back up to feed into the panels, or to feed the cables directly into the panels as they drop down? I&#x27;ve seen it done both ways, so I&#x27;m not really sure what the &quot;preferred&quot; method is.

                              <span>I have a machine (10.9.9_35) that&#x27;s an ubuntu box. I need to connect to it via vpn (http80 and ping). I can get to this box no issues when I&#x27;m in prem from different vlan. When I&#x27;m vpn&#x27;d in i can get to the gateway (10.9.9__1) and a couple other devices in the same network JUST not this particular box. I look at the firewall logs and 80 and icmp are green going to this box. From the ubuntu box i can even ping the vpn box from the ubuntu, not vice versa. I&#x27;ve even tried a win10 laptop, gave it the same IP and i&#x27;m not able to get to it thru vpn as well. gave it a different one and it&#x27;s good! 
 As far as path goes, vpn -&gt; fw-&gt; core -&gt; access switch-&gt; box. the 10.9.9.x network is L2. i&#x27;m not a linux guy so i&#x27;m not sure if there&#x27;s an internal (i doubt it because i have access to it on-prem). i&#x27;m clearly missing something here. fw rule, routing, something.

                              <span>We&#x27;re getting a new Avaya VoIP system. From what I can tell, the phones already assign DSCP values of 46, 34, and 24. Our current switching environment is HPE and Aruba based. By default, the ports do not trust DSCP. To enable QoS to give VOIP traffic priority, is it just a matter of enabling DSCP port trust on all switches end to end for it to begin working? Currently, we are not coming anywhere close to saturating our current backbone links, but I&#x27;d like to just have QOS setup properly just in case.

                              <span>Hi. We are building a home and have no access to ISP&#x27;s with a physical connection. We do have great Verizon connections on our phones though so I think some kind of LTE modem would be sufficient. I have worked with Cradlepoint IBR900&#x27;s in the past and was thinking of just getting one of them. My problem is that our room where the internet and camera equipment will be stored is right in the middle of the home, where the LTE connection suffers.
 ​
 My question is this: Is there an antenna system or something we could use to place the antennas outside on the side of the home and run that back to the IBR900 placed in the middle of the home? Or another solution that would work with this setup?

                              <span>We are preparing to deploy a new system. I apologize if I don&#x27;t word things correctly when trying to explain this, but honestly the most I&#x27;ve done on phones has been static configs and configuring switchports for VoIP VLANs. This rollout we have ESXi, VMs, we&#x27;re configuring Option 150 on a server, and I need to figure out where to point the ip-helper for the VoIP VLANs (there are about 12 but they should all point to the same whatever will be acting as the DHCP server; my problem is I don&#x27;t know what that is. On the last setup it was the CME on a Cisco 3925 router. (Sorry if I didn&#x27;t word that correctly.) I was told specifically by the vendor (Presidio) that it would not point to the router this time, but she didn&#x27;t know where to point it either. I&#x27;m looking for suggestions and your experience in helping me answer the question of where to direct my ip-helper on my VoIP VLAN configs. Our server admin says he configured our internal DHCP scope on a server (on a server VLAN and not a VoIP VLAN, and don&#x27;t internal DHCP scopes only assign to to those in it&#x27;s own subnet? ) but the only time I’ve heard of internal DHCP has been for wireless so that doesn’t sound right. I know it’s supposed to be a L3 device but if it’s not the router, then I’m lost again.

                              <span>I&#x27;m working as a NOC and I was in the office yesterday using cisco jabber to take phone calls. I could hear the ring and answer the phone call, but 3 times I did with a customer I heard nothing on their end. 
 I checked all jabber settings, my speaker and microphone settings and kept testing it over and over after the first call where I couldn&#x27;t hear. 
 I was able to dial and talk to team members and make outbound calls and hear them but when a customer would call me I would not hear it. It was bizarre. I know the wifi password was changed a few days prior for some reason at the office. So whenever I received an inbound call from anyone who wasn&#x27;t on my team I could not hear voice
 When I went back home I was able to hear them when they called. With no settings changed or nothing different.

                              <span>Hey all,
 This VPN is insanely slow compared to connection speeds and I am having a hard time finding a reason why. Keep in mind I&#x27;m a junior sysadmin at best so I&#x27;ll try to include all the needed details while keeping them sanitized. 
 Quick run down: I have a ipsec site to site vpn between two networks with 1Gb duplex connections through two pfsense 7000 series firewall appliances. Connection is stable however iperf only shows a bandwidth of 68 Mbps with transfer capping out at 8.50 MBytes from two hyper-v vm on either side of the tunnel. File transfers from local to remote site are also very slow at 20Mbps. While these speeds may work for my use case temporarily I can&#x27;t help but feel I am missing something to speed this connection up.
 Steps I have taken to attempt to speed this up:
 Set MSS clamping to 1396 after calculating my OMSS. Sniffed before and after the changes and it fixed a fragmentation issue but speeds are unchanged. Using UDP over IPv4 for tunnel.
 Ensure there was no duplex mismatch on any NIC and no traffic shaping is in place.
 CPU&#x27;s are mostly idle and a combined usage of less then 15%
 Asynchronous Cryptography is on, compression is off, no rules conflict with traffic.
 Any thoughts? I am at a loss and about to attempt another VPN option in the mean time to see if I can get better speeds elsewhere.

 a. Per my knowledge we have 2 ways for VTEP interconnection. First using multicast, and the second using MP-BGP EVPN.

 I&#x27;ve come across a frustrating and bothersome networking issue where one of my laptops on the same configured wireless network (5 GHz bandwidth) supposedly gets fast download speeds (208.04 Mbps). However, when put in a real-world scenario of installing a virtual machine like Kali Linux, the time to install and configure is night and day when put side by side on my main laptop. This older laptop model would take a considerable amount of time to download large files from the web or even install a VM. The Kali Linux VM that I downloaded just yesterday took 1-2 hours before being configured and installed. 
 On my main laptop, I get a relatively stable connection to the router as well when downloading (211.34 Mbps). yet, it appears that this laptop has no p…</span>

                              <span>I work for a service provider providing DIA and MPLS services. We have a customer to which we will provide a redundant service using dual CPE&#x27;s. He wants to run BGP towards us. Usually we use VRRP towards the customer on the CPE&#x27;s in redundant cases, eBGP between the CPE and the PE, and iBGP between the CPE&#x27;s (over the customer LAN).
 So if we are going to run BGP towards the customer, what would be the best practice way of setting it up? iBGP / eBGP towards the customer? iBGP / eBGP between CPE and PE? Or is there some other way of doing it?

                              <span>I have recently come into a bunch of cisco 2960X switches that I&#x27;d like to sell. Some of them don&#x27;t want to reset or go into express setup, so I&#x27;m wondering if I could be exposing the data of the previous owner by selling them as is. I&#x27;m not familiar enough with them to get into the console.

                              <span>Anyone know of such a thing? I want a method to ID each switch port’s cable that’s easier to change than an adhesive label
 I DIY’d one IDF’s cables with binder clips, but that was a little too bulky. I’m surprised there isn’t anything sold by someone.

                              <span>Hello. We recently got several NEC PF5240/5248 and a couple of PF5459 switches. We deal with refurbishing of IT kit. We need to factory default them but google is really scarce with any info/manuals for them. We have no logins/passwords. On boot they don&#x27;t offer or show anything to be able to interrupt boot and have a look there. Called UK office, but they apparently don&#x27;t deal with issues like that. Has anyone worked with this kit and would be able to help?

 Can someone explain here with diagrams, MPLS trace for the below scenarios
 1) CE to CE 2) PE to PE
 I have an interview coming up, I know normal IP traceroute, but the mpls trace seems confusing even after reading the INE document about it, would appreciate if someone can explain better.

 I am connected to a wifi AP which in turns connects to a router which then connects me to the internet. Is my default gateway address the IP of the router that connects me to the internet.
 I want to know since i enter the URL of a website how, which and in what order the packets exchanged to connect me to that website.

 ​
 When I trace the path towards 8.8.8.8, I can ping each hop with +1500 MTU, (above 1472 in windows ), but at a specific hop stops it and starts dropping. Why is the packet simply not fragmented when it goes over 8.8.8.8, but it is fragmented when I ping other addressess like 1.1.1.1 . Im so confused.
 ​
 And just to add, I&#x27;m not using &#x27;Do not fragment flag.&#x27;, just normal ping with extra size.

 I just installed the lastest and greatest version of Eve-NG community edition, but in this release it will always force me to use the HTML5 console or i have to click the node so it can open the telnet link.
 I used to use the API to get a list over all nodes and their telnet ports from the url value in the request.
 Now only the html5 url is present.
 Do you guys know if there are any way to get a list over running nodes and their telnet ports or should i just accept to click the node from now on or use the html5 console where copy/paste does not work for me.
 ​
 Thanks.

                              <span>Got a decent amount of certs in a shortish span of time and have been in Networking for a year for an ISP. I originally got in so I could just get the networking bit done before moving to security.
 There’s so much that comes up on a daily basis in the middle of studying my CCNP that I realize I have no clue about, and I’m not even talking about just CCNP material, just how everything at work works in general. Guess I’m just wanting some reassurance. 
 So again, how long into your guys career did it take for you to feel like, “yeah, I get most of this.” Just feel like maybe I’m behind in terms of getting into cyber security because of networking.
 Also, thanks so much ahead of time for your guys answers!

 Perhaps this is specific to Australia or the scale of the businesses dealt with but my experience and the consensus of those in other businesses and organisations here seems to be physical security companies are disorganised.
 E.g. tickets, tasks, requests are lost in limbo unless called directly and repeatedly followed up if not a simple fix. Doesn&#x27;t matter if throwing money at the provider still some tasks are lost.
 I&#x27;ve noted they often seem to not have any sort of ticketing system. 
 Often breaking systems while doing a fix for another task only to often try and charge to fix the system that was broken by them previously or not implemented correctly.
 Don&#x27;t blame the workers just seems like poor management, poor direction, keeping on top of modern processes and systems etc.
 Is this universal? Specific to the size of security companies or just an Australian issue?

 Anyways - I want to implement a feature for Microsoft 365 users to get prompted while making an email, to consider uploading their attachments to OneDrive.
 Typically big files are sent via email weekly, and there are cases, not often, where emails get bounced back by certain recipients.
 MailTips I see that this can help but I&#x27;m not familair with Exchange + Powershell, since I&#x27;m not an expert admin. Is there a GUI way of getting this to work?
 Mail Trace Rules Does this do the job? I&#x27;ve been playing around with it and it seems like it might be, but does not seem like it would prompt while composing.

 Wouldn&#x27;t have been so bad if our KVM allowed you to remote start physical servers, instead of just connect to the console....

 We are an existing $Vendor customer and we are happy with the product and our current subscription level. We are less happy with the relentless solicitations. We are a small organization with 180 users, emailing additional users in this organization decreases your chances of expanding our business relationship. I am frustrated that users continue to receive $Vendor solicitations after I replied to you on September 12th. This frustration is compounded by the fact that I have had to ask other $Vendor representatives cease emailing any live body they find in our organization. I see 119 of your emails sent to about 40 different users in our organization in the last 30 days. 
 Thank you,
 $me

                              <span>I fall in love with every piece of documentation I write. I spend a lot of time working on it making sure every little detail of the Word doc is perfect. Everything from org branding, paragraph spacing, image placement, and perfect headers/footers. Then after I convert it to PDF I obsess over it for weeks. I start my days off by reading it multiple times and drooling over all my little perfect details. I brag about it to my wife. I feel like da Vinci after painting The Mona Lisa. Such a confidence booster. 
 Is that weird?

                              <span>Hey,
 I am once again asking for your IT advise oh great and mighty users of the world wide web / Reddit.
 As usual I have been tasked with something that seems impossible.
 I need to run the Registry from a non admin user but I can only run it as a user with admin rights. However giving that user admin rights only for this one time would require me to restart the server twice which in this situation is a big no no due to other issues.
 I know about the Shift + Right-Click &#x3D; Run as different user. However I cannot make the changes without having admin rights. But running it as Administrator / user with admin rights, will only result in those changes applying to that user account instead.
 Basically what we need to do is create Keys and Entries for User A (non admin) which requires admin rights due to it&#x27;s location. But I cannot run a .reg file to add those since you cannot run it as admin or other user. Even making changes to entries is impossible since it requires admin rights to update. Most likely to prevent normal non admin users from making changes for obvious security reasons.
 Anyone got an idea?
 For information, I need to create and modify reg keys in the following location.
 HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Policies

 We have a sizable number of machines using USB-C to connect to monitors that have built-in NICs.
 There is a problem with the default driver settings for these NICs and we need to disable a power saving feature to resolve.
 The problem is we have a number of other docks that also use Realtek NICs and we must not interfere with those NIC settings.
 Does anyone have a good script/mechanism to identify one Realtek NIC from another on the same system, in order to determine the GUID, in order to apply registry settings on just the desired NIC?
 Thanks

                              <span>I work as an engineer at an MSP and we have a client that uses an onprem hybrid exchange server. the exchange server is responsible for all inbound emails. They recently purchased another company. they are asking to migrate all emails to their existing domain while keeping the original domain as an alias. The company they purchased is full o365. I have found many articles on how to migrate o365 - o365, onprem - o365, o365 - onprem. in this case, it would be an o365 - onprem but the tenants and domains are not the same. I do not have any experience with an o365 acquisition merging with a hybrid environment.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve always wondered if people in general feel the same way regarding Malwarebytes. I have been using it for 7 years now, paid licenses every year. Its the only AM/AV I&#x27;ve ever personally paid for. I love its browser guard as well. I&#x27;ve taken it too some seriously dirty places and it seems to relentlessly block everything.
 I personally feel its so good, despite having Cisco Secure Endpoint(which recently I found out from Morphisec themselves Cisco uses some of their mechanisms in Secure Endpoint) and Crowdstrike, just to be safe I will install MBAM and run a final check and uninstall it. Never can be too sure xD
 I am curious what are your preferred AM/AV software and if many people feel Malwarebytes is (one of)the best and if not why it may not be. I don&#x27;t like being biased, if there is a reason someone may think MBAM isn&#x27;t that great I&#x27;d definitely like to know why for my own preferences and knowledge.

                              <span>I am coming from the none sysadmin side, and wondering on solutions.
 Bascially while on a Teams call I will get a disconnect from zscaler which will put my call on hold, it will then reconnect and reconnect me, this can happen depending on the length of the call 1 to 2 times.
 Our IT department is now blaming my wifi for this issue, I do not think that is the issue but have taken the steps they requested which was to restart my modem/router. 
 The setup of my home which I have explained to them a couple times now is:
 1x Netgate SG-2220 1x Omada switch (8 port PoE) 1x Omada EAP225 v3 2x Omada EAP245 v3
 On a 200/10 using FQ_Codel/Taildrop (pfsense forum recommended).
 I sit about 5 feet from one of the EAP245s, it is at 18db for 5ghz and 12db for 2.4ghz and my work computer is connecting via 5ghz, all that is between them is a small inside wall (the AP is in a closet with thin doors, no glass). Measuring on my macbook air on the same desk I see -98db noise and -44db RSSI.
 I also connect the work computer to my IoT vlan which has no access to my LAN, I redirect DNS to my pfsense box and redirect NTP to my pfsense box on all of my vlans (LAN, IoT, Guest) with no issue.
 We used to use BIG-IP and had zero issues with this software.
 EDIT: My work computer is some Dell with an i7, 16gb ram and Windows 10 Enterprise.

 Team of 3
 All members have their daily account with some perma active assignments for common tasks and some eligible tasks that can be requested.
 Member 1 approves the requests and also is in possession of the break glass account and the &quot;global&quot; admin account.
 In this scenario, should member one just login to the &quot;global&quot; admin account when admin tasks are required, or should he also be requesting permissions and then having the &quot;global&quot; admin account approve the request - though that seems kind of redundant?

                              <span>Hello All,
 We&#x27;re curious how other IT professionals are managing ex-employees&#x27; mailboxes when they leave the company. The organization is experiencing rapid growth and we&#x27;ve found our current process isn&#x27;t scalable. We use Microsoft 365, but our users have the desktop applications such as Outlook through VL. Currently, when an employee leaves the company either through termination or resignation, we add ourselves to the ex-employee&#x27;s 365 account and perform a manual export of their mailbox to a PST. This PST gets saved and stored on our file server forever. Seems fairly simple when it&#x27;s listed like that, but it&#x27;s quite a tedious process from start to finish. You need to give yourself access to that person&#x27;s mailbox, let it pull in their mail on Outlook which usually takes at least an hour if not more before it becomes accessible, (and you&#x27;d be surprised at how big we let employees&#x27; mailboxes get to), and then perform the export which again, depending on the mailbox size could just freeze your Outlook up for some time. Now ironically enough we recently found that it looks like you could do all of that in the Compliance center in 365, but we still want to look at our overall process and reassess. Do we really need to keep these employees&#x27; mailboxes forever? Does 30 days suffice and then we blow it away (with exceptions of course)? Converting to shared mailboxes seems to be a popular method - what does that look like long-term? Do you use a third-party cloud solution to archive mailboxes? 
 In short, we&#x27;re just looking to explore how other businesses retain 365 mailboxes to determine our options. 
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m a little confused. I have a user that doesn&#x27;t see all preferences when printing from chrome or edge. It&#x27;s a domain env and we use point and print on windows 2019 server. On user&#x27;s machine, In Settings &gt; printers, when printer is installed from print server, I check printer preferences and all settings appear just like on server. But when they try to print from chrome or edge, when printing dialog pops up, I would select the printer and chose preferences, but none of the settings are there. Like stock/paper selection for example. It&#x27;s like something is preventing browsers to read printer preferences. I will try again signing in as me (different domain account) and checking if issue is present but I&#x27;m pretty sure I had the user sign in on another computer and had the same issue. I will test that again. On print server though, there are no security restrictions setup.
 Any one have any idea if something in browser can affect this behavior?

 We have a hurricane about to hit us.
 If you are going to call me on the DAY that a hurricane is hitting our state, and wonder why I&#x27;m not interested in having a sales discussion with you on a new line of server products you have coming out....
 Then I don&#x27;t ever want to do business with you again. 
 So far 2 have hit my never do business with you again list, how many more are going to hit it before the day is done?

                              <span>Have you made sure your organization is ready for the deprecation of basic authentication in Exchange Online?
  
⚠️ Microsoft will begin to disable basic authentication for Exchange Online on October 1, 2022.
  
So, what will be the impacts of basic auth deprecation?
 Overall, Microsoft will disable basic authentication in Exchange Online for the following protocols:
  
Exchange ActiveSync (EAS)
 POP
 IMAP
 Remote PowerShell
 Exchange Web Services (EWS)
 Offline Address Book (OAB)
 Outlook for Windows and Mac
  
Got you screaming! Is SMTP protocol also being deprecated by Microsoft?
 No, SMTP isn&#x27;t being deprecated. But if you stop using it for a while, your SMTP protocol will be disabled. Also, the SMTP will be disabled for tenants who never used the protocol previously.
 Then, what are we going to do with this deprecation?
 All we need to do is to switch to Modern authentication.
  
IMAP/POP: Now, OAuth 2.0 support for POP, IMAP, and SMTP Auth protocols have been released, so users can switch to OAuth.
 Exchange ActiveSync: If your organization still using Exchange ActiveSync, you can use Outlook Mobile clients to connect with Exchange Online.
 Do you spend more time on Remote PowerShell to access Exchange Online? Then, use Exchange Online PowerShell V2 Module which supports modern auth.
 You can begin updating your users&#x27; client applications to OAuth 2.0 versions.
 Your code must be updated to use OAuth 2.0 if you have written using protocols with Basic Authentication.
 You need to contact the developers of the 3rd party application and ask them to update it to support OAuth 2.0 or switch to an application that supports Modern authentication.

I&#x27;m currently struggling with this decision right now and I&#x27;d love to hear some input. I kind of feel like I&#x27;m crazy for wanting to choose work life balance over an almost 60% increase in salary. The idea of having to interact with my coworkers again, commuting, not seeing my family, not having micro-breaks etc etc is extremely disheartening. As we&#x27;re all in IT, the majority of us can handle most of our job from home honestly. No reason for me to be in an office to spin up a new VM or install some new roles on my 2019 server.

The rest of the organization&#x27;s Office 365 users have both an on premise Active Directory account and a separate Office 365 (Azure AD) user account. Thankfully, it would appear as if UPN and email attributes are identical between on prem AD and Office 365, so the soft match methodology for merging these accounts should work nicely.
 Of note, this organization never had an on premise Exchange server, they used a differen…</span>

                              <span>Hi guys, so I was wondering if there is a way that I can run a script on our AD as an Administrator to be able to see how many users has bitlocker on their laptops, and or how many users has bitlocker. If someone can point me in the right direction I would really appreciate it.
 ​
 Thank you

 ​
 Does someone knows, if the print spooler service on a windows printserver is logging in the windows-eventlogs, if the service has stopped? If yes, where? 
 We recently get monitoring events which are saying that the print spooler service on a server has stopped, multiple times a day. But in the normal &quot;eventlogs -&gt; windows&quot; i didn&#x27;t see a single entry who says the service has been stopped at those dates?

                              <span>Have you made sure your organization is ready for the deprecation of basic authentication in Exchange Online?
  
⚠️ Microsoft will begin to disable basic authentication for Exchange Online on October 1, 2022.
  
So, what will be the impacts of basic auth deprecation?
 Overall, Microsoft will disable basic authentication in Exchange Online for the following protocols:
  
Exchange ActiveSync (EAS)
 POP
 IMAP
 Remote PowerShell
 Exchange Web Services (EWS)
 Offline Address Book (OAB)
 Outlook for Windows and Mac
  
Got you screaming! Is SMTP protocol also being deprecated by Microsoft?
 No, SMTP isn&#x27;t being deprecated. But if you stop using it for a while, your SMTP protocol will be disabled. Also, the SMTP will be disabled for tenants who never used the protocol previously.
 Then, what are we going to do with this deprecation?
 All we need to do is to switch to Modern authentication.
  
IMAP/POP: Now, OAuth 2.0 support for POP, IMAP, and SMTP Auth protocols have been released, so users can switch to OAuth.
 Exchange ActiveSync: If your organization still using Exchange ActiveSync, you can use Outlook Mobile clients to connect with Exchange Online.
 Do you spend more time on Remote PowerShell to access Exchange Online? Then, use Exchange Online PowerShell V2 Module which supports modern auth.
 You can begin updating your users&#x27; client applications to OAuth 2.0 versions.
 Your code must be updated to use OAuth 2.0 if you have written using protocols with Basic Authentication.
 You need to contact the developers of the 3rd party application and ask them to update it to support OAuth 2.0 or switch to an application that supports Modern authentication.

 Some Microsoft documentation suggest Complaince Policies to ensure a device is secure (jailborken, min OS, etc) can be applied to Personal Devices but I&#x27;m not sure this is right? I&#x27;ve applied it to all users but unlike the app protection policies these don&#x27;t apply?
 Can Complaince Policies apply to Personal Devices or is it company only?

                              <span>We have finally gotten all users to where they are not local admins on their machines.
 We have also done a good job of having sysadmins utilize daily driver accounts as well as separate admin accounts in Active Directory.
 What I am struggling with is creating 1) &#x27;sub-admin&#x27; accounts with rights to install software on local machines and 2) sub-admin accounts for performing basic tasks in AD and on the domain.
 Obviously you don&#x27;t want to use your domain admin account to elevate a one-off software install on a local machine. And we have lots of those one-offs. We have many field technicians that require specialized mechanic&#x27;s software. And they are very different per technician. You&#x27;ll have one tech that is certified on Cummins, another Mercedes etc. There&#x27;s really no way to standardize things. So they must call in for assistance with installation.
 One of my colleagues has piloted an installers security group in AD and gave that group local admin rights on all workstations. 
 Several problems with this:
 1) you now have (in our case) half a dozen or more new accounts with the power to wipe out every single workstation. 
 2) it does not solve the problem of machines not being on the corporate network bc you can&#x27;t elevate with no DC available. VPN on every machine with another 2FA account and PW ?
 3) are we to create yet ANOTHER tier of admin accounts to, for example, run RSAT ADUC?
 The more I read, the more I get spooked to EVER use a domain admin account. But it&#x27;s also almost like a custom account needs to be created for every single task. DNS change? use your DNS admin account. DHCP change? DHCP login. Add a subnet to sites and services? GPO change? SAS account. GPO account. WTF? Is this the state of the world now ?
 I am all ears for reasonable suggestions.

                              <span>Maybe it is a stupid question , but when the client asked me I was stumped.
 Basically client has two separate networks running in adjacent locations. Lets say network 1 and network 1 . He needs to connect both networks such that any data when it leaves Network 1 gets encrypted by an appliance and then the encrypted data travels through the data pipe and when it enters network 2 gets decrypted by another appliance and the data enters network 2 as decrypted data and vice versa.

 I have seen P2P wireless devices working on same principle . Is there any other solution for the same . Vpn is not what he is looking at.

                              <span>I joined my current company in February this year, the CIO who brought me had also just started few months earlier than me, previously everyone had local admin rights, the IT infrastructure and AD was a total chaos, the CIO been implementing a lot of changes and as you&#x27;d expect, some people aren&#x27;t happy about it, especially the guys from Technical services. We installed the AdminByRequest where they can request admin rights for a period of about 30miinutes. Well the war has been ongoing since then with lots of complaints. Just got an e-mail that someone tried installing a Siemans app that requires more than 30 minutes to install so half way through the installation, the process stops since the AdminByRequest is only valid for 30minutes.
 ​
 i stand to be corrected, but is admin right only needed to start the installation process? or is it required for the entire period of the installation?
 Also is there a better way to handle this? since they are insisting on having their local admin rights? how do you deal with this in your organization?
 Thanks for your time.

                              <span>So, it&#x27;s come up a few times recently - I have a pet theory that a lot of people who end up in sysadmin have one or both of these traits to some extent.
 So... why not find out:
 ADHD screening questionnaire
 Autism screening questionnaire
 Don&#x27;t look at them as &#x27;horror stories&#x27; - chances are if you&#x27;re gainfully employed, you&#x27;re not a particularly severe case.
 However it may help you understand how your brain works, and how it&#x27;s not like &quot;Normal&quot; people. And you can make adaptations and coping strategies. 
 I genuinely feel that both these traits can be extremely beneficial in a sysadmin, if they&#x27;re harnessed effectively. Maybe you don&#x27;t even need medication for it - just a better understanding of what things you do well, and why you find the hard things hard.

                              <span>Hello,
 I configured HTTPS Listener for WinRM with a self-signed certificate, I followed this tutorial :
 http://vcloud-lab.com/entries/powershell/powershell-remoting-over-https-using-self-signed-ssl-certificate
 It works. I can connect Powershell remotly from any device on my network, even if I don&#x27;t add the self-signed certificate in the CA Trust Store thanks to options -SkipCACheck and -SkipCNCheck. I can connect with the IP address.
 But after sysprep of the server, the HTTPS listener is preserved and listens on port 5986, the self-signed cert is still in the Local Store but the remote connection doesn&#x27;t work !
 ​
 I get this when I try to connect to the server (syspreped) :
 Connecting to remote server 10.X.X.X failed with the following error message : The server certificate on the destination computer (10.X.X.X:5986) has the following errors: Encountered an internal error in the SSL library 
 I can&#x27;t connect with both IP address and DNS name (that matches the previous certificate)
 On the remote server, when I check winRM config, I get this message :
 Error number: -2144108267 0x80338115 Cannot create a WinRM listener on HTTPS because this machine does not have an appropriate certificate. To be used for SSL, a certificate must have a CN matching the hostname, be appropriate for Server Authentication, and not be expired, revoked, or self-signed. 
 Before the sysprep, winRM HTTPS was working. After sysprep, it doesn&#x27;t work anymore.
 What happens during sysprep process ? What does change with the certificate ? Do I need to use an other process to configure winRM ?
 ​
 Thanks

 After working MSPs for a lot of my career, thankfully being able to escape a few years ago, I have known people who have burned out, stressed out, and went over the edge. I have seen people die of stress, bad health, and acute lead poisoning.
 This point was driven home again recently, by an acquaintance who I worked with about seven years ago, and who was an acquaintance on social media. He was laid off unexpectedly last week. After a day or two of family stressing out about finances and how they were going to afford the mortgage payments, with his wife really laying into him on social media on how he dared to get laid off, today, I found that his wife is now a single mother, and the fune…</span>

 We have an issue where our main page of the Microsoft 365 network connectivity network assessment is not displaying the latest results from any test. The last test that the graph shows 8/14 which is incorrect. The last test we run is displayed in the location’s section. In here we have the latest results showing different points for our office. Compare that to the main page results on Microsoft 365 network connectivity there completely different. (See picture attached)
 I would have thought the latest results would be published on the main page
 Any help would be appreciated

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking for a solution to display the meeting room schedule for several rooms of that day. 
 I found something like AskCody - but other than that I can&#x27;t find many other possibilities.
 I&#x27;m open to opensource or something reasonably priced. 
 The TV we&#x27;ll be using is a digital signage TV so we could put a signage app on it or connect a NUC or RBPI that we have laying around.
 My preference goes to putting up a display (Joan or Evoko) at each meeting room - but for multiple reasons we aren&#x27;t allowed to do that. :(
 So we gotta run with what we have: a TV in the meeting center. 
 Any ideas?

 I was looking for software? Where you browse to a web gui, enter in specs of a machine and a disc image and it spins up a VM server for you. Similar to how Azure and AWS. Just a facade of those and I want to run it on a large on prem machine and give users access to thier own servers they create etc
 Im not sure where to start looking as Im not sure what this solution is called.
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>We will be migrating emails for a specific domain in the coming days and I was wondering whether anyone had done this before with Mimecast. I raised a Support Request with Mimecast over a week ago and have had no response at all, which is rubbish.
 So domain.com is currently in 365 TenantA with MX pointing directly to Microsoft and we will be bringing this domain into our 365 TenantB. We use Mimecast for our email security, so this domain will be added here too. My previous plan for these types of migrations has been:
 1) Change MX of domain.com to something invalid. Emails will queue and retry at sender for an unknown period. 2) Add domain to 365 and add aliases. 3) Add domain to Mimecast and perform directory sync from 365 so Mimecast is aware of all the new aliases. 4) Change MX to Mimecast.
 This works well, with the exception of the unknown behaviour when switching to the bogus MX records.
 It got me wondering; is there a way with Mimecast that we could bring the domain in earlier, maybe even pre-migration, so that when I start the rip out of the domain from TenantA, Mimecast will queue email and then ultimately deliver when all the aliases are added to TenantB? Is that or something similar possible?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 More and more of our clients are starting to use server 2019 on their rds farm. Eventually they&#x27;re all confronted with slow session openings.
 Firewall rules are clean, we use a script to clean them every weekend or months. PS command &quot;get-netfirewall rule | measure&quot; only returns about 1k rules max.
 I&#x27;ve read alot about the appreadiness service causing problems like this and when the service is disabled, sessions open nearly instantly. I&#x27;ve also read about problems with updates when the service is disabled.
 Are you guys dealing with the same issue and is there any other way to deal with it ?

                              <span>I have two devices connected directly peered with EIGRP:

 On the Nexus 7K, I am trying to advertise basically all my 10.x.x.x routes and block my default 0.0.0.0/0, and allow the Catalyst 8500 to advertise only it&#x27;s Loopback8 interface from its routing table.
 On the Cat 8500, I am trying to allow all the routes from the N7K in, but allow only the Loopback 8 interface to advertise out.
 This is working for the most part, except the Loopback on the Catalyst 8500 never gets advertised to the Nexus 7K. Is something wrong with my distribute-lists?

                              <span>Recently we got a router/modem and speed upgrade from our ISP. They changed our old ZTE modem to a Huawei HG8245X6 because they said it wouldn&#x27;t support the new fiber speed without having a plug in. So we decided to take the new modem, which is 2 in 1.
 It is nice and has a lot of features through the portal, but still couldn&#x27;t figure out how to change IP without having to restart it and interrupt the internet, if that&#x27;s possible to do on that, at all.
 On the old modem portal, I could just click on disconnect and reconnect in a section in portal and the IP would change without any restart.
 Am I missing anything?

                              <span>I am proficient with SOHO networking but have never worked in an enterprise environment. Is there a common, standard, and/or ideal method (or material) used to run cables, specifically Ethernet, in a plenum space?
 I’m flying solo at a small, private K12 and most of our cables are running the obstacle course around air ducts, electrical conduit, fluorescent light fixtures, and a bunch of other crap, often lying on top of (and obstructing) the ceiling tiles.
 Im curious about standard methods, code requirements, and materials I could buy to make it easier/faster/better/safer (maybe raceways?). Please advise.
 Update: Evidently, they make cable trays. That’s what I was imagining: easy entry/exit, well supported, easily mounted.

                              <span>So I have 2 different networks. 1 is a private network with no internet but it&#x27;s a network of 2 computers and 1 nas. It has to have no internet since it&#x27;s using windows xp and it&#x27;s an old pos system on 2 computers, and it would risk getting viruses. The other network is just the main computer that has connection to the internet and surveillance. Sometimes I would like to access the nas from the main computer to see how the backups are doing in the private network. Should I just connect another switch/hub from the main computer to the private network (old pos system)? Or do i need a specific type of router that aggregates/controls the ports that connects to the main computer then to the private network (old pos system)?

 tl;dr; how do you change a ports vlan for a HP Procurve in putty
 got into the switch by clearing passwords but now the webui isn&#x27;t prompting for user/password and i&#x27;m not very successful with the java errors today. (downloaded java, added trusted sites, added to java exceptions list.)
 Already set passwords in cli and got the port info i needed, now i just need to figure out how to change it to another already configured vlan lol.. Unless it&#x27;s serious i guess i&#x27;ll figure out the webui issue later.

 I was wondering what kind of automated network test frameworks people were using for things like daily network checks? My place uses Robot framework and the renat extension. I was hoping to find out if there are better alternatives out there.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m trying to write an automation script using Nornir to collect information from devices that accept REST API. I am using the http_method task but it&#x27;s always failing and i&#x27;m not sure what i&#x27;m doing wrong and was wondering if anyone managed to do something similar ?
 The API request is pretty basic and works with curl:
 curl -X GET https://x.x.x.x/api/v1/get_stuff?token&#x3D;xxxxxxx -k
 With Nornir the task looks like this:
 from nornir_http.tasks import http_method
 result &#x3D; nr.run(task&#x3D;http_method(method&#x3D;&#x27;GET&#x27;, url&#x3D;f&#x27; https://{host_ip}/api/v1/get_stuff?token&#x3D;xxxx&#x27;,raise_for_status&#x3D;True, verify&#x3D;False), name&#x3D;&#x27;Collect some data&#x27;)

                              <span>We currently have IPv6 enabled on our laptops. For roughly 10% of our users, when they connect to the VPN, DNS Resolution stops (even google.com doesn’t work). I have tried de-prioritizing IPv6 in the registry and the netsh interface commands. I have worked with Cisco to determine we have the correct settings on the VPN. Still it doesn’t work. If I have the user run ipconfig /release, everything starts working again (for a day or two). Also, if I disable IPv6, everything works for as long as IPv6 is disabled. I have spent way too much time on this with no permanent fix other than disabling IPv6. Any thoughts on something else to try?

                              <span>I am trying to replace an old switch that is EOL at a location on our campus with a 3650CX. The current connection is with a MM fiber to the distribution switch. but when I try to use the same SFP on the 3560cx, the connection won&#x27;t happen. I checked the interface to see if it&#x27;s going into err-disable mode or other security features, but nothing. the interface is 100% fine. I tried to flip the fiber as well but I am getting no results.

                              <span>Hi,
 Our site needs some switching equipment, so I ordered about 40 switches last march at the distributor. Thinking I will be in time if it takes +/- 6 months.. Well. that was 6 months ago and the current forecast (with only 80% certainty) is that it will take another 6 months.
 I already have 4x 6300 running as a core, but I need 2 more to reach my 6200F&#x27;s (already running +/- 15 of those).
 I cannot afford the wait 6 months again, with the probability that they won&#x27;t even be delivered. We ordered them before the prince increase, but I am getting the feeling that we will never get them, but if I order again, they will delivered sooner (but with an increase of the price ofcourse).
 ​
 Anyone in the same boat or has other switches working together? Like my 6300&#x27;s are stacked (as well as some other 6200F&#x27;s) and I really don&#x27;t want to stack other brands/types (if that even works) but I really am in a situation that I wanted to avoid at all cost.
 Any idea&#x27;s?

It says it connects and then when it says finishing up it fails. So app doesn’t create a tile. Is there a router setting that could be not correct? I’ve been unsuccessful connecting smart sockets also. It’s frustrating because I don’t know where to look. Thanks.

                              <span>So Networking is really not my thing (though it is something I plan to study in the near future). But as a SysAdmin for a small org, I&#x27;m stuck being a jack-of-all-trades.
 So I&#x27;m looking at my network switches and seeing options that I know nothing about and figured I would come here for some much needed knowledge and advice!
 We run multiple switches, 2 of them being 10gb Dell PowerConnect 8132. These are options under the Spanning Tree, Global Settings: They have the Spanning Tree Status enabled, STP Operation Mode is set to Rapid STP (Classic STP and Multiple STP are option), BPDU Flooding is disabled, Port Fast is unchecked, Port Fast BODU Filter is disabled, Loop Guard is disabled and BPDU Protection is disabled.
 Now I am pretty sure we should have Loop Guard enabled, as to my knowledge it is supposed to help prevent weird networking looping, so I just need clarification on that, and if someone is able to explain the rest I would greatly appreciate it!

                              <span>We are rolling out a new Cisco phone system to replace our old one. I am configuring new VLANs per site and notice the ip-helper address is pointed to the Cisco call mgr router. We have a new router for the new phone system that the vendor will be configuring, but when I ask the vendor if I need to wait for them to do that before knowing the ip for the ip-helper, she says she doesn&#x27;t know what we need to do for that which left me confused. What would you guys do?

 looking for some good reads regarding Enterprise IP schemes, did some googlefu but other than a few articles here and there there was nothing worth my time. I&#x27;d appreciate a detailed well written book (or multiple books) that goes from the basics all the way to advanced stuff.
 PS if anyone is interested in the articles i&#x27;ve found probably to get an idea of what i&#x27;m talking about just let me know

                              <span>Hope someone can help/guide me. Going straight to the point, what I need to do is extend a lan network to a distance of 2 KM with 3 intersections without losing data (as little as possible). It would be something like this: 
 Point A 0 km -&gt; Point B 800 meters -&gt; Point C 1.2 km -&gt; Point C 2 km .
 The most &quot;practical&quot; thing I had in mind is to use ubiquiti antennas but I wanted to see some other option such as running the ethernet cable over 100 meters, or using fiber optics but in the latter case I know little theory.

                              <span>Hi all,
 What are your experiences/lessons learned/caveats when changing the system mtu from 1500 to 9216 on a single platform. Goal is to improve backup/storage traffic on a Cisco 9500 platform. I’m sure we have all things covered but want to hear about any special issues someone might have come across when doing this kind of change

                              <span>Yes yes I know, another STP question. I was handed a new Aruba CX 6000 switch from my boss to play around with, and learn the new config. I&#x27;ve watched the airheads youtube series about AOS-CX which was very helpful, and I have been scrolling through the 1900 page manual, but I am not sure if I got it right. 
 I am trying to use MSTP, have my client access ports configured as admin-edge with bpdu-guard and loop-guard enabled. In my example config the first 10 ports are configured for wireless access points, the next 10 for clients, and the last 4 are for links to other switches, and to the firewall. 
 When I connect an older 2530 switch to port 1/1/24 I&#x27;m getting STP issues and the 2530 disables the port. 
 I do not have a config to compare mine to, or anyone at all to ask. Did I get this right or did I make some rookie mistakes? The VLANs are not the issue, I&#x27;m not completely new to networking, its just the MSTP that I&#x27;m struggling to understand. 
 According to what I learned I should not have to enable bpdu or loop guard on the uplinks, but only on client access ports? Does this include APs? 
 ​
 Any videos/info about MSTP in AOS-CX would be very helpful.

                              <span>Hello,
 I trie to find a client VPN IPSec compatibles Windows / MacOS / Linux with IKv2 and AES-GCM encryption support for a Fortigate Gateway VPN.
 FortiClient doesn&#x27;t support IKev2. I already try TheGreenBow VPN Clients but i have performance problem on MacOS.
 If you have any advice for an other client i will be glad to heard them.
 Thx

                              <span>I have several locations with this structure: a Cisco FTD (2110 or 2120) in transparent mode has its management interface connected to a Cisco 2960S switch. On the switch I have a vlan 1 with an IP address and from the switch I can ping the management IP and the diagnostic interface IP on the FTD. So far, so good.
 From the FTD to the switch I cannot reach anything.
 I cannot ping the vlan 1 IP address on the switch, even though I do get an ARP entry in the table, and the ping returns question marks, not dots. I had configured an IP address on the diagnostic interface in order to be able to reach a local DNS server from the FTD so I can use FQDN objects in some rules.
 I have checked ten locations and five of them work as expected (ping and DNS resolution) and five of them cannot reach the local IP addresses on the switch or DNS servers. 
 This makes me feel like a noob. How can it be that I can ping from the switch to the FTD but not the other way round?

                              <span>So a little backstory: I&#x27;m running ISP through my local Internet provider. On my end it says ports 500 and 4500 are inactive. Session status is down-negotiating. I can&#x27;t get into the local Internet provider&#x27;s router. So before I call them out here to check their stuff, is there a way for me to confirm on my end that the ports are indeed being blocked? Preferably looking for commands I can run thru CMD Prompt or putty/rutty. 
 Thanks!

We fill out ToR with ports for examples, in which that auto populates fields for the infrastructure guys to follow, and so on with any other teams that need access. 
 I feel this is very archaic and maybe some type of online form would work better. This got me thinking, what do you all use? There have to be a better solution even with some type of freeware app out there (hopefully).

                              <span>For me I lean towards avoiding them (maybe irrationally) out of spite at this point. It just clouds my judgment when there’s some new licensing scheme involved, especially if there weren’t any for the same thing 5-10 years ago. 
 I know funding is not coming out of my own pocket, and some of these things are really unavoidable. I know these companies also need to make money. I’m all for paying for great tech support by the way! But it’s getting a bit out of hand in my opinion
 Does this newish development factor into your decision making? Has it pushed you to go a different direction (if there are any)?

 In packages of the type - DHCPOFFER / DHCPACK, option 54 is substituted for the cisco address. But this does not happen for DHCPNAK packages, why is this so? Is there any way to fix this?

                              <span>If you store your network configs in version control, do you have one single repo for all devices, or do you split it up?
 In one place I&#x27;m thinking of changing from separate ones to a monorepo - I&#x27;d love to have a single commit history of all config changes. I could then filter the commits by folder if I wanted the split view again.

 I host a site on IIS that allows members to add people to their account. A fee is charged when this happen. Users must agree to terms and check a box kind of thing. Verified the button disables after one click. 
 Using Fiddler we see the POST request sent only once by the browser. Wireshark capture on the client shows only one request, best I can tell.
 We have our fortigate hosted in Azure.
 The request goes to the FortiGate which performs SSL Offloading before passing along the traffic to the IIS server.

                              <span>Hello,
 is there a standard or best practice as to whether DHCP reservations should be set inside or outside the address pool?
 Simple example: DHCP Pool &#x3D; 192.168.0.50 - 192.168.0.149/24
 The client should now get a &quot;fixed&quot; IP in form of a reservation. But which? 192.168.0.50 or 192.168.0.150?
 I have read different recommendations so far, from definitely inside, definitely outside to never mind.
 Sometimes I stumble over devices that don&#x27;t even allow a reservation outside the pool.
 That&#x27;s also why I&#x27;ve always defined reservations within the scope and only really fixed IPs outside of it.
 On the other hand, the pfSense Docs says:
  
ISC dhcpd only checks via ping to ensure that an IP is not actively in use when making assignments.Making a static mapping does not “reserve” that IP out of the pool.The static mapping in this case merely represents a preference for an IP and others are not prevented from taking the IP if it is not in use. 
 (...) 
 As such, it is best to only make assignments outside the range/pool, and the GUI enforces this practice.
  
So how it the right way to do it?
 Thanks and greetings,
 Martin

 I&#x27;m working alone in a company which has 2 branches in different cities. Unfortunately i have a little budget to setup a firewall. I need to merge these branches through the vpn for better tracking and backup system.
 What is pros and cons of long term use untangle for vpn, threat detecting etc. ?
 Is it worthy to giving a shot or should i search for an another solution ?

                              <span>I need to create a PBR with multiple next hops but have them verified by different track objects. In IOS there is a parameter to use a sequence number to order the next hop list. I could define multiple next hop addresses in different set statements each with their own track object like below:
 IOS-Router(config-route-map)#set ip next-hop verify-availability 1.1.1.1 ?
  Sequence to insert into next-hop list
 ​
 In NX-OS 9.3.3 this feature does not seem to exist. I can only configure a single next hop if I use the verify-availability parameter and no sequence number available. I ran across an ePBR feature introduced in 9.3.5 but wasn&#x27;t sure if this was the future of PBR on nexus or something different. Has any one come across this and found a workaround?
 N9K(config-route-map)# set ip next-hop verify-availability 1.1.1.1 ?

                              <span>In our DC we have a FW that is configured with a /28 outside interface. We mostly use these public ips for remote access and various public to private and private to public nat translations. Recently we have just used our last available public IP however I have just received a request to create another public to private static nat translation so that our internal smtp mail server can be accessible externally. My question is, if I request another /28 from our datacenter to use to complete this request , would I be able to configure a new public to private static nat using one if these new ips even though my firewall does not have a interface in this new subnet?

                              <span>I am having difficulties with my Adtran 1550s (AOS) authenticating to my NMS Auvik. I am able to authenticate with SNMPv2 with a community string, but I would like to use SNMPv3. They seem to authenticate sometimes, but other times it with just keep trying and trying with no authentication. 
 My questions are, does every device have to have a unique engine-id? If so, is there a way to automate which one the switch chooses or do I have to manually enter each one to be unique? In addition, does anyone know of any limitation on what passwords the switch will accept for the sha and des? Perhaps my actual passwords are using forbidden characters?
 Below is an example used (with usernames and passwords substituted):
 snmp-server engine local 800002980300000000000001
 snmp-server view &quot;GroupExample&quot; 1.3.* included
 snmp-server user UserExample GroupExample v3 auth sha encrypted password1 priv des encrypted password2
 snmp-server group GroupExample v3 priv read GroupExample
 Any help is appreciated. Thank you for your time.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 My company has some employees who travel and stay in hotels without any kind of WIFI security. I&#x27;m afraid someone is scanning/wireshark the network.
 What&#x27;s the safest way for them to use those kinds of hotel WIFIs?
 Should I ask them to connect to the Corporate VPN (full-tunnel ) when they are travelling?
 My environment is Cisco, we have Cisco NGFW, Cisco AMP, Umbrella. 
 Thanks, guys

 If a switch/router has a route to a destination via an IGP and MPLS label. Why will it use MPLS? is it because MPLS label is at Layer2.5 and the IP is at L3?

                              <span>We will be replacing 2 Cisco nexus distribution switches which are connected to the two 7k cores (2 links from each switch to the cores, 1 link to 1 core and the other link to the other core).
 We are using vpc on our switches and rstp for spanning tree.
 Typical 3 tier Cisco architecture.
 Only has 1 svi for switch management and a bunch of vlans.
 Default gateway pointed to svi on core switch.
 Has ACLS, snmp, qos, aaa and ntp configurations as well.
 Access switches have uplinks to distribution switches using port channels.
 Distribution switches have uplinks to core using port channels.
 Will be replacing them with 9k Nexus switches which will have the same configuration as the old ones (apart from the svi which will temporarily have a different IP).
 Plan is to connect the access switches to the old distribution as well as the new distribution switches so that end devices/access switches can reach the core switches 2 ways, 1 through old distribution pair and the other through new distribution pair. Therefore all we have to do is turn off old ports on old pair during the change window and we should expect traffic to flow through new pair?
 Is this the right way?
 And we want this to be done with no downtime.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Hi there
 Other than a slightly cringeworthy name, does anyone have experience with them? Good bad or otherwise? I saw them mentioned in a thread here when I searched, but not a whole lot of feedback. I got good feedback from a very trusted friend on them and I reached out for a quote for a small order.
 My usual go-to, Approved Networks, has no 10G LR at the moment and I need a dozen or so by end of this week, so looking for an alternative not named FS. I like FS and all, but I use them for less critical items.

                              <span>We have an Aruba wireless environment, Mobility Conductors and Controllers on 8.6 and Clearpass 6.9 publisher and subscriber. We have been running Clearpass in this setup for a few months and now we have a large influx of clients back on site we have experienced auth issues where Clearpass appears to start timing out all auth requests and basically prevents any new unauthenticated clients from getting on the network. This seems to alleviate once client count goes down. 
 Our vendor and Aruba have gotten involved and they suggested the number of auth requests was overwhelming our Clearpass servers. We found that hard to understand as I believe we have 2 x 25k license and matching hardware and we were seeing issues at 4k clients on site.

                              <span>Unless I am missing something, it looks like I am unable to apply a mac access-group to an existing etherchannel on the Catalyst 9600 series switches. I am able to apply it to individual interfaces though. InfoSec would like to block individual mac addresses from our enterprise network and we have used MAC ACLs successfully in the past, but recently we replaced one of our Nexus 7K PE routers with a Catalyst 9K and I have been hesitant to apply the mac access-group to individual interfaces when they are bundled in an etherchannel. This guide only seems to reference applying mac access-groups to layer 2 interfaces : https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst9600/software/release/17-1/configuration_guide/sec/b_171_sec_9600_cg/configuring_ipv4_acls.html#task_wzn_zbk_ldb
 Does anyone know if applying the mac access-group to individual interfaces will break or harm the etherchannel?
 When I attempt to apply the mac access-group to an etherchannel I get the following error :
 % This is an invalid access-list to be configured for ip access-group

                              <span>So we are going through a network upgrade which includes all new devices, new ISP circuit, new servers, new fiber, etc. One thing that is new and we haven&#x27;t dealt with before is implementing SPLUNK. SPLUNK will be used to log everything from clients, servers, network devices, and whatever else. It is currently setup and running, but not currently collecting anything from out network devices. 
 For our syslog, we currently use Solar Winds Kiwi Syslog and that collects the data from all of our devices. My understanding with SPLUNK is that we set up a forwarder and the forwarder takes all the logs the Kiwi collects and forwards them to SPLUNK.
 Our department director is tired or waiting on the contractors to figure things out, so we he wants us to start configuring SPLUNK. He stated that he thinks SPLUNK has modules or packages you can setup that are made for Cisco devices which should make it easy to setup.
 What is the best way to go about setting this up? Is using a forwarder the right way to go about doing this? And if that&#x27;s the case, do I still need to setup some type of module on SPLUNK for cisco devices? Or do I just forward the logs and analyze them that way? I was told to figure out what devices I need data collected from, but we already have kiwi collecting logs from all devices, so was thinking that those logs could just be forwarded as a whole. I didn&#x27;t think I would have to install modules for each device that I want to collect date from. 
 I have zero experience with splunk, so just looking to get pointed in the right direction.
 Thanks.

                              <span>My school have a smooth wall firewall and i assume are using dpi however i was required to download a root ssl certificate which i have deleted because of security risks involved with root certs. Without these certs some sites don’t load because of not being able to establish a https connection. I have pritunl vpn in a vm on a server and it accessible through port 17905 which i don’t think is a standard port if i use obfuscation would the vpn work and get past the firewall or because i don’t have the ssl cert downloaded would that stop me connecting. Does anyone have an idea of what part either the ssl cert or dpi is blocking i also noted that you can’t seem to connect to IP’s directly as in i couldn’t connect to the vpns webpage even though i port forwarded it though i could connect to websites that i reverse looked up to find there ip The vpn works when on any other network including 4g(on iPhone) Is this just a easy case to finding a vpn that supports obfuscation to bypass the dpi? Thank you

                              <span>Hello all. 
 I was at a conference the other day and saw that Cisco DNAC can adopt and provision brand new switches / routers without needing telnet/ssh first.
 From what I understand they are using DHCP Option 43 to point devices to DNAC but also mentioned using the g0/0/0 OOB port. Is this possible with Ansible? I would hate to have to login to XXX brand devices just to get Ansible reach ability for configuration.
 Im also open to any other product if you all have any ideas.

                              <span>Hello all , i am currently migrating for a customer to deploy cisco sd-wan across all the sites.
 While doing so migrating for the datacenters i had no issues at all , but while migrating for the braches i faced a little issue with the Vlan creation on the Cisco Vmanage.
 as i do usally i first check the router configuration that is currently deployed on the site and then create template on the cisco vmanage for the sd-wan router thats going to replace it, while all the brached on the customer side are router on stick which means all the vlans are created on the router it self and there is no core switch or any kind of L3 switch on the braches.
 The only issue that i am facing is that the customer has total of 94 different vlans on each branch , so the questions is do i create 94 different vlan template and push it ? , which i already did and was stuck at about 30 and i cannot put any more on VPN 1 (service side vpn) , or is this another way or solution that i am not awre about ? 
 appreciate any help or advice

                              <span>Anybody has this firmware stored somewhere?
 The PDU is old, but I used it still in my personal network.
 However the current version has small glitches and locks up every few weeks. 
 So maybe someone has firmware for the iPoMan II 1201 v1.12 or v2.xx even. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am running ‘show arp’ that gives me the MAC address of a device I am after, I am trying to see what port this device is connected to, to retrieve this information I use ‘show mac address-table’ however, the MAC address returned is completely different. 
 Anyone know why this is? I physically plugged directly into my port 27 on the dell switch of the known device and the MAC address from the table is still wrong but arp is showing the correct MAC address. I also tried clearing the MAC address table with no luck. The dell switch is running firmware 6.6.3.6

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 ​
 I am trying to set up a backup NTP server for remote client PCs which have joined domain when they are disconnected from corporate network.
 ​
 I followed this blog post particularly &quot;Enable Backup Simple-NTP Sync&quot; part to have a backup NTP server for remote client PCs.
 https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/core-infrastructure-and-security/domain-time-synchronization-in-the-age-of-working-from-home/ba-p/1440820
 ​
 After adding those reg keys I captured NTP traffic with wireshark but I only see NTP traffic between client and external NTP server even the client is connected to corporate network via VPN.
 interesting thing is that when I run w32tm /query /status command, it shows the source time server as my domain controller though I did not see that traffic on wireshark.
 ​
 My understanding for these configuration is that the client will first try to sync time to domain controller and if domain controller is unreachable then will try sync time to external NTP server.
 At the moment the client PC does not even try to talk to domain controller by looking at captured packets.
 ​
 Does anyone have the same issue?

 I have been unable to save the name of some cloud-only distribution groups after editing them via the 365 EAC web UI, most I can edit and save without issue, but some return &quot;Object reference not set to an instance of an object&quot; when I try to save the new name.
 Turns out if you swap to the Classic Exchange Admin Center and edit the name there, saving the new name works without issue.

I have really good eyesight so I&#x27;ve never thought about getting one, but can you point me in the right direction of what to look for? It would help to be able to move the camera above what im working on to see without straining my eyes. Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been doing VPN since it was a brand new idea, and not enterprise-y enough for a real company. I&#x27;ve been dealing with WANs since Frame Relay was still a neat idea.
 Today I find out the new office I&#x27;m bringing online this week will not be part of our MPLS network, but instead use a &quot;Software Defined WAN&quot;.
 My question is when did they change the name, and how much less expensive would it be of they still called it a VPN?

 I wrote a tool to hunt out DNS config errors that allow for subdomain takeovers. You wouldn&#x27;t believe how common it is. No one looks after DNS.
 I&#x27;ve done a couple talks about DNS takeovers in the UK now at places like blackhat and bsides. I&#x27;m really hoping to present it at defcon next year and I&#x27;m doing a tonne of research using different DNS datasets.
 I&#x27;d really appreciate if anyone can point me at some obscure DNS takeover blogs they&#x27;ve come across.

                              <span>Edit: Thank you for the support guys, this really means a lot. I wanna thank you all for taking the time to cheer me up :)
 Okay so, most of you are probably thinking: Pride in IT support???
 But hear me out...
 I recently started a job as a 1st line IT support employee. I was really proud of myself when I got this job, because for me, it was a way to get into IT. It also happend to pay well.
 The way I looked at my job, was like this: An entry level IT job that I can grow in and use as an foundation to hopefully grow into something else.
 I never looked at it like it&#x27;s a low job (in a negative way), even tho it&#x27;s on the bottom of the pyramid.
 The thing is that I sometimes get negative comments that put me down and make me lose the motivation and pride in what I do, or the grow process that I&#x27;m in.
 Some of the negative comments or actions that I experience: &quot;Just let him do the shitty work, he&#x27;s a first line employee.&quot; &quot;You&#x27;re not on our level yet, our work is way more difficult.&quot;
 Just comments that show that I&#x27;m on the lowest level of IT.
 I know it&#x27;s not the most prestigious job, but is it really that bad and shameful?
 Ps: I don&#x27;t hate what I do. It&#x27;s a boring job, but it pays well and it&#x27;s comfortable.

                              <span>My boss asked me to move a few things and re-cable his desk while he was gone. No problem, borrowed facilities to drill some holes, swapped some cables and extended others.
 Boss goes to print something today to his desktop printer, but no workie. Printer is happy, no error messages. Check the print queue, full of pending jobs. Cancel all but the latest one, and check Control Panel.
 Printer offline.
 Double check the printer for errors and physical issues. The USB cable is a little loose on the printer end, but it seems to move in-and-out smoothly and stays put once in.
 Double check computer. No errors other than printer offline.
 Pull printer out from the wall to check the back for physical issues. Notice the empty USB port.

 Move the USB-B cable from the RJ-11 port to the USB port. Laser printer happily dims the lights and triggers the UPS, then spits out the print job, just like it&#x27;s supposed to.

I had a POC server spun up in 5 minutes. This is an open source product that has better documentation than any product I&#x27;ve implemented in the past 25 years.
 Checking out the repository now and trying to see how to contribute. I can see using their documentation as an exemplar to show my team ideas on things to include and how to present it.
 Kudos to the developers. They take pride in their work and it really shows.

For several months they gutted our building up north and sent everything down to Florida. This included several critical servers that we used for sales and customers. They flew me down to the area to do a cross-training class with the local support. We didn&#x27;t do it in the office (a modest 3 story prefab building), but did a drive by and saw the moving trucks sitting out in the back parking lot still loaded up.

                              <span>Hello, I need acess a server running on port 12883, however I need to access this from within my school which blocks all requests not on port 80 or 443, hence I was wondering I if somehow I could setup a proxy server at home that could just forward all my packets from port 80 to 12883 and redirect them to the server, then translate them back onto port 80 to send them back to me.
 If anyone knows of somthing that can do this or how I could go about coding somthing along these lines I&#x27;d be gracious

                              <span>Lemme just get this out of the way: I do not know what I&#x27;m doing, I&#x27;m not fond of Macs, I&#x27;m a PC sysadmin. My client, however, feels differently and has asked me to look at his home laptop which is obviously a Mac.
 Title says it all really, file is located in Users/User/Pictures/photolibrary.photolibrary/resources/derivatives/thumbs, can&#x27;t find this location, either it&#x27;s hidden or perhaps part of the photos.db? Either way we need to either move, delete, or rename this file but as it stands I can&#x27;t find any way to interact with it. Could the db be corrupted?
 NGL all I can do is speculate as I really know nothing about OSX. When I say nothing I really mean nothing, my experience with Macs is about enough to get angry when trying to right-click.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working hard trying to get rid of NTLM from my domain, which has been difficult to say the least with the number of third party vendors and other utilities that simply do not work with kerberos.
 One of the issues we&#x27;ve run into is that scheduled tasks with stored credentials don&#x27;t seem to work after disabling NTLM. We definitely need jobs to run as domain users, rather than SYSTEM. For those of you who have managed to wipe out NTLM, how have you dealt with this?

                              <span>Specifically this has to do with end user machines. At multiple different doctors offices (some run by large hospital chains) I see more computers just left unlocked with lots of personal information on them and unattended. In hospitals the same problem exists and the only type of security seems to be “well it auto locks after 10, 15, or more minutes” even at one hospital where you have to scan a badge to unlock the computer on the screen it has a countdown timer to auto lock after 20 minutes. 
 At a recent ER trip they left the room every time without logging out and the dashboard up basically told me about everybody’s current issues, name, DOB, etc. including myself
 I understand that IT and sys admins only have so much power in the medical world and doctors will complain if a computer locks but there has to be a happy medium?
 I understand that critical medical equipment can not go to sleep or lock but the end user machines entering data should have better policies

 For e-mail I came up with a solution that isn&#x27;t perfect but helps. I created a e-mail rule that if the words help, broke, fix, etc. exist in an email from an internal users group excluding VP&#x27;s and fellow IT that a automated response is sent. 
 The automated response is in short similar to the below.
 This is an automated response. It appears you require assistance and may be better served with a call to the helpdesk at ext. xxx or by entering a ticket at http://xxxxxx

 When I run winrm enumerate winrm/config/listener on the Hyper-V server in question it shows the following. ListeningOn &#x3D; null looks like the issue but I don&#x27;t know how to fix it inside the GPO so I don&#x27;t have to manually make this change on other servers or workstations. Can anyone tell me what I&#x27;m doing wrong here?

 i have a new question for you. Since now finally OneDrive is working with the GPO&quot;s 
 I am wondering if this is possible as well. 
 ​
 Since OneDrive gpoeditor provides only to backup desktop/pictures/documents. I was wondering if there is an GPO available from Firefox or Chrome in the admx files where i can store the bookmarks for example on documents, or desktop etc.
 ​
 I downloaded https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/187202?hl&#x3D;en#zippy&#x3D;%2Cwindows
 i downloaded https://github.com/mozilla/policy-templates/releases
 ​
 and did the following: https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/xpc45u/comment/iq3auit/?utm_source&#x3D;reddit&amp;utm_medium&#x3D;web2x&amp;context&#x3D;3 
 So it works, when i want to add the admx and adml files, now i see it.

                              <span>I run solo IT for an engineering firm with about 80 users with all the fun that comes with the job. We&#x27;re big enough to require full time IT (me), but not big enough to have two IT staff (even part time). Thinking about bringing on an MSP as a backup for times when I&#x27;m on vacation, or in the hospital, etc...
 Curious to hear tips from anyone that has been thru a similar scenario. If they are to be a true backup rather than a simple help desk in my absence that would require giving them access and documentation to *everything*, not to mention wondering how they would handle all the specialty software that comes with the industry, keeping them up to date with changes, etc... Just wondering the best way to go about that, or if we shouldn&#x27;t even try and just get them to cover 80-90% of the basics?

                              <span>Hello sysadmins, 
 I am trying to set the SPN (servicePrincipalName) of an AD Service Account user object but am getting the following error: 
 //
 Operation failed. Error code: 0x20b5
 The name reference is invalid. 
 000020B5: AtrErr: DSID-blah blah, problem 1005
 (CONSTRAINT_ATT_TYPE), data 0, ATT 90303
 (servicePrincipalName)
 // 
 What is the naming standard that AD is expecting here? Request came from another team so I&#x27;m not too sure specifics of the Service or application. I can request this information if I need it. 
 All help is appreciated. 
 Thank you.

 Tl;DR what do small businesses (&lt;100 devices) use to patch/update devices?

                              <span>I was an idiot and expanded a data drive (does not contain the OS) on a VM that had checkpoints in place from a few days prior in my Hyper-V environment.
 The server was shutdown at the time and came back online just fine. The data volume is operating fine and nothing seems out of place from a user experience perspective. That&#x27;s the good news, nothing bad has happened yet..
 However, what are my options now? The OS does not see the newly allocated disk space if relevant.
 The main VHDX is 13.5 TB (this is the one I expanded), the AVHDX is 419 GB, and there is 829 GB free on the drive that contains them both so there should be enough space to merge them.
 My primary concern is merging them with now mismatching disk sizes between the VHDX and AVHDX. Can I shrink my expansion back down to the previous size and then delete the checkpoint to complete the merge?
 We do have VEEAM backups both onsite and in the cloud, but obviously 13.5 TB is a doozy even over the LAN.
 The checkpoint is from 9/20, the expansion was on 9/24, and the time of this posting is 9/27.
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;m looking to get back into mainframes, but I&#x27;m realizing what I (barely) remember of the s/360 I worked on way back when doesn&#x27;t seem to fully translate to the s/370 and newer architectures that the Hercules emulator I&#x27;m running in an LXC container provides - or I&#x27;m simply misremembering.
 Do these machines newer machines come with operations manuals or something other than the &quot;help&quot; pages from the command line? I&#x27;ve been un-lucky in my search for documentation on these machines.
 If anyone could point me in the direction of some documentation (even if it&#x27;s printed.. seriously) on running one of these machines, I would greatly appreciate it.

 The AD Replication Status tool is extremely handy and I&#x27;ve seen different threads on specifics seen in Event Viewer, but I was wondering if anyone knows anyone at Microsoft that might know if they&#x27;re fixing this - again, after the expiration this past July?

 Hoping someone from MS might be browsing Reddit... :)

                              <span>Howdy,
 I&#x27;m helping a small business who is redesigning their network from scratch. I&#x27;m looking for some recommendations on how to segment the network and also recommendations on securing the Guest network.
 We are going with Ubiquiti/Unifi equipment. When everything is all said and done we will have:
  
UDM/router
 POE Switch
 4 WAPs
 6 (or so) outside security cameras
 1 badge reader for door access
 1 video doorbell
 6 smart TVs
 I think that&#x27;s it but will update if I think of anything else
  
The couple computers that are used only need internet access. There will not be a file server or the need to share files. All that is done through OneDrive/Teams which just needs internet.
 ​
 What recommendations would anyone have for different networks to have? I was envisioning possibly 3 networks:
  
Main Network
 Guest Network
 IOT Network (not sure if we need this one)
  
The Main Network would be for all the stuff in the list about except the TVs.
 The Guest Network could be for the handful of computers they have. These could also go on the Main Network but I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s any real need for that. Could go either way on this one. Smart devices could go here.
 The IOT Network could be for the TVs and any other &quot;smart&quot; devices that might get added down the road. Again, not sure if this is actually needed as these could just go on the Guest Network.
 ​
 The other question is, How would you recommend we secure the Guest Network?
  
Wide Open - Company Computers would then go on the Main Network
 WPA Key - Post a key on a sign, people can connect to it just like any other network. Smart devices could go on this network
 Wide Open w/ Terms &amp; Condition - Need to click &quot;I Agree&quot; like at a hotel - This is annoying at times and some equipment doesn&#x27;t handle that sort of interface very well. Smart devices would probably need an IOT network then.
  
​
 Thanks for any input and ideas.

                              <span>Does anyone have any experience with this? Client was sold a new printer by Canon without talking to us and they were told nothing would change. They were using ULM which integrates to their AD. It appears that ULM is no longer supported and Canon told the client they will need to use Uniflow Online Express which I believe is the free tier of Uniflow. 
 I&#x27;m really struggling to find anything on the Canon site about the technical details, it&#x27;s mostly just sales stuff. From my understanding so far it won&#x27;t link with AD, that would be the paid for uniflow version which would also need the paid for Universal Print by Microsoft (which uses Azure AD rather then AD). 
 I think the bit I&#x27;m hazy on is how it all connects. Does the Uniflow driver connect to something in the cloud that connects to the printer?
 Going forwards it&#x27;s not essential that it integrates with AD, it&#x27;s a small school with 60 - 70 staff, so I could set them individually and add it to the new user process, but I curious as to peoples experiances.

                              <span>The title says it all: is it possible to delay e-mails that get sent to an external recipient with a slight delay?
 We&#x27;re using a third-party tool to attach our internal and external mail signatures. The tool also attaches the signature to the mail within the senders&#x27; outbox, but it uses the signature of the last email sent.
 That&#x27;s our Problem. For legal reasons, we need to always attach the external signature within the senders&#x27; outbox.
 As the tool doesn&#x27;t provide this feature, it would be helpful to delay the mail to the external recipient for a few seconds, so the signature would be our external signature. 
 ​
 Is this possible with exchange online, or is there a better solution?

 I&#x27;m currently doing an apprenticeship as a sysadmin in Switzerland and I&#x27;m wondering if you guys could tell me what useful certificates I could get to start in this business. I feel like I don&#x27;t get enough training in my apprenticeship that&#x27;s why I want to get some certificates so I&#x27;ll have a better chance of finding a good job after my apprenticeship.
 Some certificates that are currently on my mind are MS-700 Teams Administrator Associate, AZ-104 Azure Administrator Associate, and the Cisco CCNA. What are your thoughts? 
 ​
 Thanks for any help.

 The cost of storage has our IT Service continuously fighting over the usage of this said storage.
 I have several scripts running to clean old data that haven&#x27;t been modified/accessed in years.
 But once you get to that infamous 260 character limitation, things become quite tedious. One liner PS scripts become a mix of special functions to &quot;bypass&quot; the character limit, exporting data into csv changing the format of the paths, and reimporting everything back. Untill you realise that a special character such as &quot; [ ] &quot; cannot be processed.
 My users have the bad habit of creating path folders as if they were writing an encyclopedia, no effort whatsoever is put in keeping path folders short.

                              <span>With the &quot;recent&quot; rulings from more and more data protection authorities regarding the legality of using Google analytics as a European company - it has finally become a priority for us to get a proper overview. 
 Our &quot;known&quot; offenders have been working on this for a while preparing pseudonymization or moving away from GA, but as we have 400+ domains each with the option of subdomains I&#x27;m sure we have more around which have come in over the years from M&amp;As or simply rogue employees. 
 As we have a pretty good overview of the domains I&#x27;m looking for a simple way to scan a list of hostnames and produce a GA &quot;Yes/no&quot; result. 
 I considered just doing an invoke-webrequest and checking for references to GA .js files such as 
  
Google Analytics (ga.js)
 Google Analytics Remarketing (dc.js)
 Google Universal Analytics (analytics.js)
 Google Analytics Global Site Tag (gtag.js)
 Google Analytics Experiments (ga_exp.js)
 Google Tag Manager (gtm.js)
 Google AdWords Conversion (conversion.js)
 Google AdWords Phone Conversion (loader.js)
 Google AdWords Remarketing (conversion.js)
 Google AdWords Dynamic Remarketing (conversion.js)
  
I&#x27;m not really sure if that would produce valid results 
 surely someone else has already come across this, or produced a script which my google-fu is just not able to dig out 
 I&#x27;ve looked at sites such as builtwith.com or gachecker.com - but can&#x27;t run through 1000s of hostnames by hand

                              <span>Hi awesome Sys admins. I have an exo mailbox that sends on behalf of some users from a web server. I would like to know if there is a way to allow only the web server to send on behalf of these users. Eg. mailbox [webserver@domain.com](mailto:webserver@domain.com) sends and email to client coming from [user1@domain.com](mailto:user1@domain.com). I would like that [webserver@domain.com](mailto:webserver@domain.com) can only send on behalf of [user1@domain.com](mailto:user1@domain.com) from IP 1.1.1.1. 
 Microsoft support guy says its not possible but im sure someone here knows of a way.

 Over the last few days we are starting to see users having issues with onedrive for business.
 The Onedrive client will either hang at &quot;processing changes...&quot; of &quot;We are trying to sign you in&quot; 
 We also see that the client removes synced folders from explorer, and when we try to sync them it prompts a message saying &quot;We found this folder, would you like to use this&quot; 
 More and more users are having general issues with Onedrive, are you guys seeing something similar?

 Is this normal? It happens all the time and theyve been trained up on the platform.
 I’m not sure how high of a standard a NOC usually is.

                              <span>Hi
 New to the Chrome Enterprise world and still trying to understand how the admin console and management process works there. 
 It seems like I can apply settings only to organizational units. That has raised 3 questions:
  
Is that accurate? That&#x27;s the only segmentation I have? 
 Can I apply a setting to a specific user or a machine? 
 What happens if I apply two conflicting settings to two different organizational units, and one user from OU1 logins to a browser used previously by a user from OU2?

                              <span>Hi gents,
 ​
 I have an question for you, and hopefully someone can help me out. 
 ​
 I am trying to get the proper GPO&#x27;s enabled for our OneDrive environment. 
 But here is the problem
 ​
  
when i go to \\domain\sysvol\domain\policy , first issue there is no map called PolicyDefinitions.
 When i create the folder PolicyDefinitions in that root, and i copy the adml admx files in that new created folder.
 In GPOeditor under computer/administrative settings only having the OneDrive settings. But when i remove that folder the old settings are back, really strange.
  
anyone who can help me out?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve started doing my apprenticeship program (Ausbuildung in German) in a medium jewelry manufacturer as system administrator. And most of the time there is always something to do. Someone&#x27;s PC won&#x27;t boot, we need to install or configure smth, etc. But sometimes there is literally nothing to do, and I just sit there doing basically nothing. Of course I am not doing all the tasks since I am only a trainee, so I wanted to ask if that also happens to you.

 Does anyone have any recommendations? I&#x27;ve been searching for a while and can&#x27;t find any places that tick all the boxes for us.
 The main requirements are: * Up-to-date MacBook hardware options * Same day swap out service when a device is faulty * Short and long term (2+ year) rentals (mostly long term)

                              <span>Hello all.
 We were currently evaluating some email security solutions.
 We evaluated Proofpoint Security Essentials and Anubis Networks.
 Both are very good, however, meanwhile we also acquired Office 365 E5 licenses for all users, and thus, we were able to test Microsoft Defender for Office 365.
 So I&#x27;m asking your opinion, if I should spend money on Proofpoint (therefore having 2 products Proofpoint SE + Defender) or if Microsoft Defender for Office 365 will be enough to stop those pesky emails (spam, phishing, malware).
 Thank you for your opinions.

                              <span>With the death of IE, I have been given the task of somehow putting a bunch of /16 ranges into Enterprise Site Mode so some ancient tech can still be used.
 This is because the tech uses TLS 1.0, which is now no longer supported in Edge. So we have to use Enterprise Mode.
 The documentation seems to indicate that there are NO wildcard options for Enterprise Site Mode, but will something like putting: &#x27;10.48&#x27; allow all subsequent addresses?

                              <span>So today we discovered a rather worrying issue when it was reported that someone (User A) was able to see private appointments in User B&#x27;s calendar when they shouldn&#x27;t have been able to.
 Cue digging around in the calendar permissions and delegates to see how this could have happened but no where did User A have any such permission.
 Eventually we found that they were in a group that had been given full access to User B&#x27;s mailbox, however previously this has never been an issue and the permissions have been in place for quite some time. As a test, we removed the group from Full Access and half an hour later, User A couldn&#x27;t see private items anymore.
 I can&#x27;t find anything online (feel free to perform better Google-fu) that suggests that MS have made this change and our mailboxes were migrated to EO a few years ago and there haven&#x27;t been any recent changes that we&#x27;ve made. Has anyone else encountered this recently?

                              <span>Good day to all my fellow sysadmins!
 I am once again asking for your technical support.
 I have a very strange case of &quot;tries to connect to something other, than what I want it to&quot; with outlook, or more precisely, an add-in, which doesn&#x27;t have a lot to do with the service, it tries to get the certificate from.
 Let me try and explain, as I am a total newbie, when it comes to certs:
 My client has MailStore installed on-premise and the add-in activated for his outlook installation. When opening Outlook, with the add-in, a cert warning pops up, asking, if I trust this website/ connection. When I look at the cert, I see &quot;TRAEFIK DEFAULT CERT&quot; as the issuer. Now, I&#x27;ve looked up the name, and it seems to be a trustworthy service of some sort, but again, it has nothing to do with our MailStore …</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 I’ve recently got a new job at a company to migrate from their current MSP to lead the in house IT department, and eventually phase them out.
 We have been back and forth with them and they have let us know that they can’t provide any access to anything before signing an indemnity clause (which is fair enough).
 We are sorting out the new agreement where they are asking which services to drop for now and to change to a block hour rate service instead.
 They run RMM software as usual, and are asking if we want to adopt it with a fee. Are there any better solutions for a small business instead of RMM? Monitoring/Management more tailored for in-house IT?
 Any other advice from people who have maybe dealt with this situation before will be appreciated as well.
 Apologies if not enough detail, first time posting.

                              <span>Is now a good time for job change given the fact that we are heading into a recession. 
 I have been working as a system administrator for the last 12 yrs.(mostly onprem infra and Azure for AD). I have recently passed AWS SAA C02, CKA. I have gone thru some courses on Ansible, jenkins, Terraform, Python to understand all the moving pieces in the world of DevOps. I have done some small projects at my home lab to get an understanding of these technologies. 
 I have started looking at the job market this month and started noticing very few postings. (I am based in Canada, looking for opportunities in US and Canada). 
 I spoke to few of my friends and colleagues who are in the industry and i have got mixed opinions. Some say, DevOps job roles won&#x27;t be affected even if we end up in a recession. Some say, just stick to my current job (stable job) until the dust settles. 
 I m really confused of what to do. Should i wait until early next year or should I continue with my job search. 
 Please advise.

                              <span>Seriously wondering if it’s time to leave IT as a profession. I’m finding it more and more difficult to keep up with the changes and increased complexity and no longer find any joy in learning new stuff. Honestly to the point I dread upgrades because it always breaks stuff and takes a ton of ky time. I have absolutely no desire to go into project management or sales, so that’s obviously not a career direction.

The problem is with both Outlook OWA and desktop.
 Users are not able to receive external emails to their aliases.
 Emails not going to spam or junk.
 I have verified with the MS email tools that email flow is working.
 I thought adding an alias was pretty straightforward, but just to be on the safe side I have removed and then re-added the aliases following MS KB to the letter.
  
Am I doing something wrong?
 ​
 EDIT: Okay, so now I feel like an ID10T *facepalm*
 The specific user I was testing on had well over 100 rules setup... Yep, one was blocking. Not sure which, though, so I will have to go through them with her.

                              <span>I&#x27;m actually asking for home use (hence my lack of expertise, and my hacky solution shown below), but was wondering if there was a more correct way to achieve this.
 On the web the commonly suggested method seems to be to add the share in Login Items.
 This works initially but as it just fires at login and doesn&#x27;t keep alive through disruptions, the user will have to reconnect manually through Finder again should the connection drop.
 Were I on Linux I would just use fstab, but I&#x27;m seeing some conflicting information on this for MacOS and Samba network shares.
 It varies from using similar files in the form of &quot;/etc/auto_master&quot;, &quot;/etc/auto_smb&quot;, &quot;synthetic.conf&quot;, and then of course &quot;/etc/fstab&quot; itself (which itself has further different suggestions to use &quot;cifs&quot; in the filesystem type column, or &quot;-fstype&#x3D;smbfs&quot; in the options column).
 What is the best, and most &quot;correct&quot; approach as of Monterrey, which will ensure if the connection drops, the mount will work again upon reconnection?
  
Hacky (albeit working) solution.
 Launchctl file in /Library/LaunchDaemons.
   
  Label org.obfuscated.name Program /Users/obfuscated/mount.sh StartInterval 2 ThrottleInterval 0  
 
 mount.sh
 #!/bin/bash if ! (df -h | grep /Users/obfuscated/mountDir); then mount -t smbfs //guest@192.168.0.242/MediaGuest /Users/obfuscated/mountDir fi

                              <span>I wanted to get some people&#x27;s opinions on an affordable but robust way to connect new cabins (sleeps 12 in bunks) at a summer camp. Because it will be new construction we&#x27;ll have more options in terms of cable runs and infrastructure. As we are a nonprofit, cost is always a concern and has to be balanced with performance. We currently use mostly Ubiquiti gear for better or for worse and have 500mb fiber coming in with internal fiber to most developed &quot;areas&quot; of our 1000 acre campus.
 My initial thought was running fiber from one of our main hubs to the central bath house, where a fiber switch would feed fiber directly to each of the cabins. In the cabins&#x27; attic would be a media converter and access point. I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;d like to get some ethernet drops run into convenient places and have the ability to upgrade to a fiber switch if more connections become a need late on.
 Thoughts or suggestions?

                              <span>So we had some fun at work today. First some background - we are an industrial manufacturing company, and our head office is on the same premises as our factory. Our primary server room shares a wall with the raw materials warehouse. Don&#x27;t ask, we&#x27;re working on changing this.
 ​
 This morning I go into the server room to get a serial number off a device, and I notice a puddle of water on the floor. Fortunately all servers are in racks and are lifted well off the floor, so no equipment is in immediate danger. We immediately call facilities to come and take a look and while we wait, we trace the water to a leak in the drain leading from one of the air conditioners. Now while this was cracked, it shouldn&#x27;t be leaking this much, as it drains outside of the room.

                              <span>TL;DR: I suspect that the CEO of our MSP is reading my (confidential) emails. How can I prove it?
 Longer version:
 I work for a small company with 120 users. I am in charge of the administrative departments, including IT. We have a dedicated IT staff of 2; they do most of the heavy lifting regarding the day to day admin stuff and helpdesk. We use our MSP for infrastructure and M365 administration including exchange online.
 We have been working with them for 1.5 years now. In the last few months some issues have come up regarding their adherence to SLAs. Plus we are currently negotiating new server equipment (they are one possible vendor amongst others).
 During these discussions their CEO has confronted me with some arguments about which I am unsure how he might have obtained them.

                              <span>We have a few users that will occasionally post some pretty dubious technology or security related articles to some of the company teams channels. It&#x27;s pretty annoying, and I often need to get in there and refute something, or point out how it doesn&#x27;t apply to our situation.
 I&#x27;m talking about people tagging IT and saying that we need to turn off windows updates ASAP, with a link to an article titled &quot;Microsoft confirms it&#x27;s intentionally bricking 3rd party laptops&quot; (I&#x27;m paraphrasing the title) . The actual article is wildly misleading, and appears to be a reference to a problem with a windows update that happened several years ago.
 Also got a &quot;Looks like we can stop using MFA?&quot; comment in reference to an article with a title like &quot;MFA does nothing!&quot;. This one was native marketing for a privacy VPN product. The argument was basically that MFA doesn&#x27;t stop your employer from monitoring your web traffic, technically correct, but misses the whole point of MFA.
 Do you guys have a ready response when people post stuff like this? If it&#x27;s a security vulnerability thing, I see if there is a CVE reference, if it&#x27;s an MS thing, a KB. with those it&#x27;s possible to actually check if this is a real thing we have to care about, but it basically never is.

                              <span>All, 
 I&#x27;m looking for some clever ideas for some kind of &quot;Thank You&quot; gift for people inside my company who are NOT IT personnel but they go above and beyond to help out with our IT department. These people are typically in our remote offices where we have no IT support and do some of the standard &quot;move patch cable from #x to #xx,&quot; &quot;connect computer to internet so I can remote in,&quot; &quot;reboot kiosk computer when frozen,&quot; etc.
 I&#x27;ve always thought it&#x27;d be cool to have a common gift that they can proudly display on their desk or bookshelf that shows my appreciate for them beyond the constant &quot;Thanks YOUs&quot; I send them via phone, email, Teams, etc. 
 Do any of you have any ideas for this type of gift? I was thinking something simple like a coffee mug or desk ornament or something along those lines. It doesn&#x27;t have to be &#x27;dirt cheap,&#x27; but I&#x27;d like to be able to afford quite a few of them and send them out then someone goes above and beyond to help out.

 I have over 10 Webex Room Kits I&#x27;m looking to get rid of. We&#x27;ve had them for about three years, but I&#x27;d like to move our nonprofit to Teams for the license cost savings. My vendor is looking into a buyback, but that isn&#x27;t moving very fast, and it&#x27;s not a guaranteed solution. 
 Someone pointed out https://webuyuseditequipment.net/ but I haven&#x27;t reached out there yet. Does anyone have a go-to option for getting some cash back for good equipment you don&#x27;t need anymore?

                              <span>Hi,
 Sorry if this question has been asked before but I simply can&#x27;t find a clear answer anywhere.
 I work for a small firm as a developer, but since I&#x27;m the only IT&#x27;er I&#x27;m also the one who manages their office 365, even though I&#x27;m far from an expert.
 Currently I&#x27;ve been aware for a while now that basic authentication will be disabled and I&#x27;ve taken precautions so that external applications won&#x27;t use this method any more.
 Just to be sure, I&#x27;ve enforced MFA for all the key users (but not everyone because they don&#x27;t want the hassle)
 But now I&#x27;m seeing the following message in Azure:
 &quot;Starting Sept. 30th, 2022 Combined registration experiences for MFA and SSPR will be enabled for all tenants&quot;
 I checked and currently SSPR is disabled.
 I&#x27;ve been looking around and can&#x27;t find a clear answer on what exactly will happen after sept. 30 for the end user.
 Will everyone have to run through the process of MFA and SSPR after oct. 1??
 In the sense that they will be logged out, and have to set up an additional authentication method?
 Thanks

                              <span>I own a domain for exclusively personal use. My email service is properly set up with SPF/DKIM/DMARC etc (it gets 10/10 on mail-tester.com).
 However 6 weeks ago the VPS I use switched IP addresses, and suddenly Google started outright blocking my emails with the following message: 
 Our system has detected that 550-5.7.1 this message is likely suspicious due to the very low reputation of 550-5.7.1 the sending domain. To best protect our users from spam, the message 550-5.7.1 has been blocked. Please visit 550 5.7.1 https://support.google.com/mail/answer/188131 for more information. 
 I have checked all my mail logs, and there is no evidence of the domain being abused, and personally I do not send out any spam. I have since tried to fill out the Google from to have the domain unbanned twice, with no apparent results.
 My domain or IP is not listed on any blacklists, so I&#x27;m completely out of ideas...
 Google Postmaster reports both the domain and IP as having a &quot;bad&quot; reputation 2 days before I obtained the new IP address, so maybe the IP belonged to a spammer before?
 Does anyone know what I could try next?

 Not wanting to remove any email as the mailbox is used for search function for every task.
 Brainstorming the best solution here. Seems moving older email to a backup external drive PST outlook file would be best and if they ever want to look at this then just have the external drive plugged in always on the laptop when opening Outlook thus still having all these emails and not reaching the 100GB limit by O365 standards?
 Curious to know what others have done in this situation when the 100GB is reached and Microsoft not really having a solution past the 100GB. *Making internal standard to just tell users such as this to remove emails and not use mailbox as search for several years in the past is not really an option as easy as that could be...

“In our attack scenario, the PowerShell command will execute a Meterpreter payload,” the company wrote.
 Cybereason then ran Notepad++ as ‘administrator’ and re–ran the payload, effectively managing to achieve administrative privileges on the affected system.
  
Ah, yes...

                              <span>Good afternoon 
 Just looking for some advice,
 I’ve noriced a lot of my servers are reporting group policy errors under the system log stating ‘The processing of group policy failed internal system error’ and to check the operational log. I’ve checked this log and can’t see any errors? 
 I’ve filtered the event ID 1125 on one particular server and it’s very random. One day it happened 4 times, another day twice and some days not at all. I’m really stumped, nothing appears broken on the GPO front, the furthest the error ID 1125 goes back is Jan 2022. Looking back through them again it’s very random when the error is logged. 
 Just curious if anyone else has these event IDs regularly in their environment 
 Thank you

 Currently we are blocking all outbound traffic to a country on the FW but occasionally a DNS request for a service will resolve to server there. We&#x27;d like only responses to be from other servers in the region even tho country X might be closest.
 Thanks!

Am I right in thinking that after 30 permit there is essentially a &#x27;block everything&#x27; not already defined style rule?
 ip access-list extended &quot;BYOD&quot; 10 permit udp 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 10.1.1.10 0.0.0.0 eq 67 20 permit udp 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 10.1.1.10 0.0.0.0 eq 68 30 permit udp 0.0.0.0 255.255.255.255 10.1.1.10 0.0.0.0 eq 53 exit 
 From the examples I have seen online, I don&#x27;t have to add the gateway address or anything? Or should I be naming specific address ranges that the client shouldn&#x27;t be able to access and then setting a permit ip any any underneath 30 permit udp....
 Thanks for any guidance you can give.

                              <span>So in the past few years I have been constantly dealing with super bad quality video courses of software companies in order to get their &quot;tEcHnIcAl CeRtiFiCaTion&quot;.
 Most of them were some sort of backup service, antimalware crap, pentesting stuff like acunetix, you get the idea.
 The other day for example, I had to do a certificate for an anti malware client like kasperski or norton and the company left in multiple retakes of lines he had to do.
 He either had to cough or didn&#x27;t get the pronunciation right and went: &quot;aw damn, gotta do the line again - OK! - bla bla&quot; and went on with the rest of the script.
 I just don&#x27;t get why you would make them so unprofessionally.
 Now I do get that people can be overworked and struggle to get the video out in time, because this might not even be their actual job.
 The company probably had to get the video out in time, but come on man, this is just such a pain to watch and retrieve information from.
 Also what&#x27;s up with non native english speakers putting out english tutorials in shitty english?
 We&#x27;re talking about companies that make literally dozens of millions of buckeroos per year in profit.
 It&#x27;s just so damn of putting. 
 Some sentences sound like questions, but are not questions
 Some sentences are grammatically incorrect
 Some sentences are being mumbled
 Some words are used in the wrong way 
 And don&#x27;t get me started on flashy graphics in the video that don&#x27;t have to do anything with the product itself and the cheesy, soft gitarre music in the background.
 Do you get what I mean? 
 I&#x27;m probably just fed up with having to do these wannabe technical certifications, so that our company get&#x27;s better pricing for said product, but damn... 
 I think I need to look for another job.

 According to docs, this config is stored in WMI as XML
 How to update it when you need to add some changes - new routes or additional aovpn server or something else stored in that $ProfileXML?
 Longer version:
 On first thought easy solution to update XML would be to just remove old CIM instance and then create new but there&#x27;s downside - if there&#x27;s any reason new one won&#x27;t be created (some mistake in config or any other reason) - the connection to this remote device might be lost and we&#x27;ll need to intervene with manual connection to affected workstation or laptop and do the manual troubleshooting, running scripts etc.
 So that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m looking for a way to update config instead.

I am 32 now in a dead end job and its always been in my mind that when i have had enough of my job i can get into IT. I have been in the same job for 10 years now earning minimum wage, struggling every month to get by and i cant even tell you why i have done that, i have hated every single day but ive just stuck with it because its the easy option i suppose. 
 To top it off my girlfriend is now pregnant and its hit me, I really need to step up now and get my arse in gear.
 I would love advice on what is the best area to get into, and what i need to learn. I am UK based in Manchester so i would want to obviously work in this area. I truly believe i could pick up anything pretty quickly, I am hungry guys, something has clicked in my head finally.

I’ve previously used the built in gateway without a license (becuase lazy) and that has come to haunt me later so im looking to see if there is any alternative for this? 
 The problem is just that i cant use up many IP’s on the range and need a single entry point to a separate lab lan of sorts. 
 Thoughts that have crossed my mind is using Traefik or pfsense and port forwarding but im not sure this is the easier way of doing things. Any suggestions on how to solve it?

 Quick question: do you guys know what GPO disables Windows button / start menu?
 The old Sysadmin disabled this but I want to renable this.
 I&#x27;m checking the RDS Lockdown Policies OU but I can&#x27;t seem to find it. 
 Does anybody know which policy would cause this? 
 Thanks for the help &amp; kind regards!

 We use SCCM. However, SCCM can not perform the post-verification test and send a report. 
 We have 400+ servers and we are verifying manually. So how do we automate this and create a report?
 Ex: AD Server / DHCP /DNS / SQL / APP /IIS /etc etc

                              <span>Hey,
 anyone knows if there are any way to manage the visibility for every users calendar? For example we want to be able to see everyones appointments in their calendar and also see the title of the booking - not just the appointment with a &#x27;busy&#x27;-title.

                              <span>Hi, I have an issue where some of my clients (thin clients) connects through the gateway server instead of direct connects. I have enabled the settings Bypass RD Gateway server for local addresses. 
 This problem occurs when connecting from the RDWeb site.
 If I do a direct connection from the RD Client it is working. 
 All my clients are on remote networks connected by VPN so the RDS severs and the clients are on different subnets. 
 DNS lookups is OK, for example I can ping all addresses both by server name and fqdn.
 Also tested to open all ports in the vpn tunnel but the same problem occurs. 
 The strange thing is that not all clients or remote offices have this problem and they are setup identically so I can’t find what is causing this. 
 Any ideas?

                              <span>Purchased a copy of Visio LTSC Standard 2021through Journey Ed for a user. Downloaded it from the Microsoft Volume Licensing center. Every time I try running the installer, it fails after a few seconds, giving a &quot;Couldn&#x27;t Install&quot; error with error code 0-2054 (0). I have tried uninstalling all other versions of Office from the device, disabled firewall, and after hours of additional troubleshooting, finally resorted to completely wiping the computer and re-installing Windows 10. Even after this, with literally nothing on the computer but a stock Windows 10 install, I get this error. I decided to try installing this on a completely different computer just to test, and sure enough, that one gets the same error. Any idea how I can install the volume license version of Visio successfully?

                              <span>I want to set a new password policy in AD for normal users.
 Currently it is:
  
8 characters
 Expires after half a year
 Complexity required
  
​
 My draft for a new policy:
  
14 characters
 Password does not expire
 No complexity
 Also regular matching with hashes of haveibeenpwned
  
What is my goal? Users should set a secure passphrase once instead of insecure iterations of the same password over and over (password!01, password!02, and so on). The password should only be changed in case of a suspected breach.
 What do you think? I am actually quite convinced not to let passwords expire at all. But in many publications you can still read that they should rotate every 42 days. :|

 Wondering if is is possible to create maintenance windows to prevent schedule tasks launching during scheduled downtime of dependent services i.e. network shares?
 Otherwise I just need to remember to shut the server down, then turn on when scheduled downtime ends.

                              <span>And how did you avoid getting blamed for any issues because the lazy colleague doesn&#x27;t do anything?
 My current issue is, that I am supposed to transition support for an application to a colleague. The colleague has been involved with app support for the past two years. He has made zero contributions to any scripts, processes or improvements. A few months ago I figured out he hasn&#x27;t logged into the app in several months. Now that I am transitioning support to him, he only does support when specifically asked. No insightful questions, or how does XYZ work, or request for meetings to show feature ABC. I am the one who has to chase him to show him how to do things.
 During a critical issue where I was on the call with the vendor, the colleague seemed &quot;Away&quot; in Teams. I told my manager (tactfully) that I need to show my colleague how the issue was resolved, but he is away. Manager just said, &quot;Yes, continue to work with him and let him do the work&quot;.
 I have a feeling this will come back to me some how. I was thinking of keeping a record of all meetings, how-to sessions, meeting invites etc. Later on, if this does come back to me, I will just my manager what was done to transition support.

                              <span>Hi,
 If my question is surprisingly simple for you, it is because my background is not in telecommunication. I&#x27;m a machine learning engineer. But for a project, I need to understand the environment very well.
 I&#x27;m learning about the handover and resource allocation in telecommunication. The handover is not the main part actually. But because transferring devices get triggered by devices&#x27; measurement reports, I need to understand it in the context of 5G.
 The problem is 3GPP standards and ETSI are generic and don&#x27;t talk about what happens in devices exactly. Online websites that talk about it contradict each other.
 So I&#x27;m wondering if someone can point me to a document that explains exactly what happens in a mobile device before sending those measurement reports.
 Thanks,

                              <span>I manage a 40G ring network with around 10 locations. Each location has around 20 routes. Each site is using a Juniper EX4300 pair connected to an OSPF ring. Our DC sits on the ring and aggregates all routes with a pair of EX4600s. Our firewall then does peering and WAN. 
 We are in the process of migrating from a ring topology to a star topology in a new colocation space. I am looking for advice on hardware. Each location will be connected to the DC w/ 2 x 10G fiber strands and 1G WISP backup. 
 I am thinking of dropping 2 x MX150s at each location, and then using an ACX 7024 pair at the DC, but is this overkill? Should I just upgrade to a better L3 switch setup? Looking for recommendations. I love Juniper but am open to other options. I am pretty familiar w/ Cisco IOS and other similar platforms. We are somewhat budget oriented, but I am trying to stay away from Mikrotik. (We are required to have support contracts)
 I have never working with the MX or ACX series before. I was considering the MX204, but with the EoL announcement, it is out of the question. We are looking to purchase hardware early next year, and it will probably be another year after that until the project is complete. Thank you

                              <span>Hi All,
 I&#x27;ve been working almost exclusively with Cisco wireless over last few years (some Meraki thrown in for good measure). This includes ekahau surveys, deployment, troubleshooting a range of AirOS and the new Catalyst WLCs, across hundreds of deployments at this stage. 
 I have an upcoming opportunity to start working with Aruba wireless side of things (due to costs, lead times in some areas, general boredom, proof of concept), which I have not touched in years. Generally I would say a wireless protocol is a wireless protocol, regardless of vendor - However, based on your experiences, is there any glaring differences or &quot;gotchas&quot; when it comes to switching from deploying cisco 5508/5520/9800s to the Aruba equivalents? I would love to hear some personal experiences from others making a similar switch, and how that went.

 I have a quick question on a Cisco Core 4507 with Redundant Supervisors (WS‑X45-Sup8-E) on how many of the 10GB ports are active when the Supervisors are in Redundant Mode. With the Supervisor 7E when the supervisors are in Redundant Mode only 1 of 10GB ports are active and the other three ports (2 i know are 1GB) seem to be disabled. I am trying to figure out if we would see the same behavior with the Sup8 as well

 I am coming from the research community and programmable switches are big nowadays, with people pursuing research into new applications that push the boundaries of the data plane. My question is though, from the industry point of view, are programmable switches a big thing? Are they seeing more and more adoption in enterprise networks? And specifically, are there any use cases you can share?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 Looking for a bit of help with a problem we&#x27;ve had for a few weeks please.
 ​
 Background:
 ​
 MPLS network, each site has 2 routers running BGP into the WAN. Central internet breakout from an data center (EMEA or AMER). Our data centers also have MPLS routers and host a couple of server environments, a legacy environment and a production environment. 
 The problem:
 ​
 Since last August (we know the date/time with a high degree of confidence) utilisation on the external interface of one of our DC FW&#x27;s has been maxed out, the switch interface it connects to is the same resulting in packet loss, slow connectivity etc. 
 The timing of the utilisation increase on these ports corresponds with one of our engineers making a mistake on the switch that connects to the inside interface of the …</span>

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am in the process of configuring Cisco Umbrella DNS filtering and I noticed that, whilst it wasn&#x27;t working particularly well on Chrome (only blocking the first request and allowing subsequent requests straight through), it was working perfectly on Firefox.
 After doing some digging, it appears that when Chrome detects the DNS servers in use support DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH), it will automatically, unless specified by an admin policy, switch to using Secure DNS.
 With Secure DNS being served over HTTPS, this traffic no longer arrives at Umbrella on port 53 and appears to bypass DNS inspection completely.
 I have a case open with Cisco Umbrella on this one, but has anyone else come across this? Surely they haven&#x27;t enabled DoH on their DNS servers and created a bypass for their own product?
 Edit: disabling Secure DNS via Group Policy for corporate users is definitely a possibility. I will have them routing via the (Secure Web Gateway) SWG so it would likely get caught there. I have intention of securing Guest WiFi users of which I have no control over their devices/browsers. This is my main concern.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been tasked with setting up a site 2 site VPN into a clients Azure network. Out company primarily used Digital Ocean and I&#x27;ve spun up a droplet and installed strongswan to set up an IKEv2 connection to the client.
 We seem to keep failing at phase 2 and the returned logs from Azure say that the encryption keeps failing.
 I can&#x27;t find any resources online to see if anyone else has tried this way before, am I fighting a losing battle here??
 Are Digital Oceans VM&#x27;s capable of connecting to Azure via strongswan IPSec tunnels and what in the world are the encryption algorithms that match! I&#x27;ve tried several and can&#x27;t find any that suit both sides.

                              <span>ssl-termination operates only as a FULL-PROXY and has the advantage of unified certificate management. 
 When HTTP/2 is used, even if the backend (server-side) is h2c, it is impossible to centralize the certificate.
 Does HTTP/2 discard the advantage of certificate workday management? Should I just manage the certificate with CI/CD?

                              <span>Hello
 I was tasked to migrate 10 legacy asa clusters (versions 7.x-8.x, ASA-50XX) to other vendor while never worked with cisco. No ASDM available.
 As I am understanding it slowly in general, vpns were always something I had least exposure to. Could anyone suggest how to effectively confirm if VPNs are still used on those?
 Currently Im evaluating if vpns are to be migrated or no. Some have vpn configs, others don&#x27;t..So on those where I see it:
 As I understand, seeing live tunnel is best direct evidence of it being used (show vpn-sessiondb)
 In case I do not see it at time of it being established - are there some stats in cli available that would tell me if it was used say last month and how many times? If no stats tied to dates, anything that could help is appreciated.

                              <span>I am working on Ethernet switch on FPGA. I have 8192 MAC addresses, I am trying to create the MAC table by passing them through the 16-bit Hash algorithm. I have a few questions about this;
 I use the hash algorithm result as the address port of the block RAM which I use as the mac table. In this way, I complete the search process in 1 clock cycle, but for the 16-bit HASH algorithm, a very large RAM of 2^16 &#x3D; 65536 addresses is created. Only 8192 addresses of 65536 addresses are used, the rest remains empty. I don&#x27;t know how to do this more efficiently. Thank you in advance for your help.

                              <span>I work with a small business that has ATT fiber and a hosted VoIP phone system. For the last 2 weeks they have experienced issues with their desk phones dropping calls and losing the ability to dial out intermittently throughout the day. No changes were made on this network before these occurrences. 
 We first called the phone vendor and asked them to troubleshoot, they told us that the phones run over the internet so as long as we can confirm internet is stable then the phones should work. They also recommended we call ATT and have them disable their SIP-ALG settings for our circuit. 
 Called ATT and had them disable SIP-ALG, but the problems continued. 
 I should also note that I have sat a full day at this clients office and monitored multiple ping tests to different internal and external devices and never noticed any drops, even when the phones would disconnect.
 This network has only a WatchGuard firewall and a netgear PoE switch in front of the phones, I&#x27;ve replaced both of these devices in hopes that one of them were faulty. Issue still persisted and phones continue to drop.
 Client is pissed, vendors pointing fingers, any suggestions appreciated.

                              <span>I&#x27;ll preface this by saying I&#x27;m fairly new to the networking world so I apologize if this is a stupid question. I&#x27;ve been asked to set up a network at this medium-sized church and I&#x27;m not quite sure what the best option is. The ISP installed a fiber connection to replace the preexisting DSL. They installed a Cisco 4300 series router and gave us a static IP to use. Because the router belongs to them I can&#x27;t configure it in any way. It doesn&#x27;t have DHCP set up so I have to manually set everything up. The church already had a cisco SG350-28P 28-Port Gigabit PoE Managed Switch that they had connected directly to the Cisco router.
 ​
  
I need to know if it is possible to use the managed switch for routing or if will i need to install another router. 
 If I were to use the switch for routing what would that look like and would it pose security risks?

                              <span>Building two new data centers and current have four ISP&#x27;s planned for each of them. Each ISP is 1G for now and could be upgrading to 10G down the road.. Today our old DC&#x27;s running dual ISP and using ASR1001-X with mem upgraded to 16G with full inet routes. So for each ISP we had an ASR and then peer the two ASR&#x27;s. From there we had 3850X (Stack) setup as core with EIGRP taking the default route only. Idea was just get the traffic to one of the ASR&#x27;s and BGP best path would kick in. Again for the most part it worked pretty well.
 But with us stepping it up to four ISP&#x27;s the old design is just not going to work, we&#x27;ve seem to be maxing out the ASR1001-X with two full tables (which is maxed out at 16G) so this isn&#x27;t going to work.
 So looking for a Edge router that can handle two to four full inet tables. For the core thinking we can just do what we did before as these 3850X should have zero issues with 4G maxed across all four ISP&#x27;s or even 40G if all upgraded to 10G each.
 Or is there something else out we should be looking at for the core switches as well?

 Thanks in advance...

                              <span>I wanted to post a question without getting into the entire topology of my network environment to get people&#x27;s opinions and experiences of what you all have done. We have a network change/design opportunity and I am wanting to eliminate some route redistribution between OSPF and BGP. We use BGP for WAN routers to some of our sites around the state. We have remote connectivity from all around our state via our private fiber network, DMVPN tunnels (iWAN), and various peerings with Telco providers. We do this via 2 different data centers where we peer with different Telco routers via BGP, Cisco&#x27;s iWAN, and our statewide aggregation routers that connect to our private fiber network across the state. The fiber network continues to grow as we lay more and more down each year. We bring those BGP routes into OSPF via route maps that have prefix lists attached to them. I wanted to go more into BGP and stop the route redistribution wherever I can. 
 I am wondering if I should use BGP community values or route tags to allow our sites all around the state to determine what the best path to take would be. Basically every one of our remote locations have several methods of communication back to the data centers. I would like to make one path look better, and fail over, or be able to easily switch paths by changing a route map somewhere centrally to our data center. So if I change a value of a community string or route tag, all the sites switch paths at the same time, should I decide that needs to happen. Am I going down the right path here? Are route tags the best way to do this, or are community values the standard way to do this?

                              <span>I have a network that has Server 2016 running DHCP, Sophos UTM 9 firewall, 3 Cisco CBS250 switches and Unifi access points. They are running out of IP addresses at this location, and I was wanting to create a new SSID and put it on a different IP range so that users can connect devices to that network and work with their mobile devices and laptops.
 I have setup a VLAN for that the SSID in Unifi and created a new Scope in the DHCP server. I also set the firewall DHCP relay to point to the DHCP server so anything looking for those requests can find that IP range. 
 I have setup something like this a few times in other devices using Unifi but in this current setup I am unfamiliar with Cisco and Sophos. I have figured a lot out by Googling and watching videos but I can’t seem to find this exact scenario that I am trying to recreate. 
 I am wondering if I can just setup the DHCP scope, set the network inside of Unifi with the new IP range and point the DHCP relay to the firewall without using VLAN or if I need to use VLAN how I can get it to function properly across the network.
 Do I have to create a VLAN in the Sophos for this or do I just need to tag the firewall and point the DHCP relay back to the server? Also the switches are Layer 3 which I honestly have never used personally. I have been reading up about them but still unclear how I can utilize the layer 3 in this situation. 
 I hope my post doesn’t get locked this time for being low quality. I hardly ever ask anyone for help when trying to do stuff and figure it out on my own but this one has me over thinking everything.

                              <span>I am designing a hypothetical network for a homework assignment. It is fairly simple thus far, but this question I have is proving more difficult to answer than I expected. I have watched networking educational videos, I&#x27;ve looked for sources, but it seems that my firewall implementation idea is somehow novel, though I am certain it is not. Or, perhaps it is such a dumb idea that it does not exist online. 
 I want to segment my network. Simple enough. My idea was to use firewalls at the edge of each network segment (&quot;star&quot; topology central router leads to firewalls at each outgoing port for the various departments) for high security. 
 Is this... Reasonable? I only seem to find network segmenting that simply uses switches, but with no firewall other than that which leads to the WAN or DMZ. Additionally, how would these firewalls generally be configured? I would imagine I could allow only the ports that are reasonable for that segment&#x27;s network usage?
 Also, can I use application proxy gateways at the edge of network segments? Online sources imply that proxies should only be used at the outside edge of the LAN. I want one proxy for one department, but a different proxy for another. Each then accessing the central router of the star topology. 
 TL;DR can firewalls be reasonably used as a security measure for multiple internal network segments? What might that look like for security purposes? Same question for application proxy gateways?

                              <span>Hi, we have two buildings, eight units in each building, and we are looking at doing a bulk internet deal for them.
 We are deciding between a line of sight (microwave?) Service with asynchronous up/down speeds vs dedicated modems to each unit via cable provider.
 Both offers are priced similarly and have 5 year contract terms. (4-5% yearly increase in price) The microwave provider is everywhere wireless. They would deploy redundant equipment, backup power supplies, and service equipment. We own it after 7 years. Speeds are 500Mbps or 1 Gbps, but not higher at the moment.
 My question.. I&#x27;m not sure how to evaluate the microwave offering and if it will be superior to the cable modem in each unit. Latency/jitter, etc. What should we consider? I can ask one of their other recent deployments to test their system.
 From a risk perspective, the DOCSIS4 rollout will possibly drive down prices of cable offerings (at least introductory prices), and we&#x27;ll be paying more in three years than we negotiate today.

                              <span>Hello Everyone! Using a Throwaway!
 Thanks for reading! I&#x27;ve been lurking and laughing along with you all for a few months now. I&#x27;m hoping you can give me some advice.
 In the past few years I transitioned from a chef, to an operations manager and sys admin of a commodity trading group. They had some unsecure and inefficient practices, like all users logging into a single email account. I&#x27;m sure you can all imagine some of the other things they came up with.
 Once hired I purchased a domain, and implemented messaging software. This business receives an enormous amount of email and I really enjoyed creating systems that helped them be more aware of what was happening.
 I don&#x27;t anticipate leaving but I am planning on taking courses to help me stay in the field when I need to leave this company.
 Can anyone recommend meaningful courses I can take outside of a degree that could help further my career as a sys admin?
 ​
 Thank you!!!

 I was just wondering if this is happening industry wide?
 And if you are, may I ask what you are migrating too?

 Is the there a standard for scripts and code you create? Is is assumed to be the property of your employer?
 I&#x27;m thinking in terms of some unique way in which I might use a block of code, or an entire script or program.
 What&#x27;s the best way to look at this?

 One IT person to another...could also send you a sick throwback Star Wars shirt if that sounds more fun. 
 Just trying to honestly earn 5 minutes to discuss securing your cloud backups. No fluff. Thanks for letting me be persistent.

 Ryan, 
 Few things beat Dr. Pepper. Especially when dealing with late-night system upgrades. 
 Trade you one month&#x27;s supply (3 cases?) for 11 minutes to show you a strategy for making sure your cloud backups are secure? 
 Thanks,Chuck

                              <span>After the panic hit my company had to downsize. During that time I accepted a lot of tasks. After we got over the hump and started growing I was promoted to management and willed myself to hold on to my task, do automation, keep up with new technology, become the one stop shop for Azure. It all came to a head last week and I walked out for a long weekend breather. Quieting my mind I think I have determined I simply cannot be everyone, be an individual contributor, and manage. I have to pick. I think I am going to continue to be a manager, grow my team, and be the muscle that moves the company&#x27;s technology forward.
 I still have the desire to learn Linux, establish powershell 7, get into Ansible, make the assets management system and much more but I guess those days are going to have to be behind me.
 Has this realization come to any of you?

                              <span>Hey guys, So basically I am a developer (front end web and backend) but for years I always messed around with web hosting. Setting up servers, etc. I’ve always been SUPER into hardware (passion).
 But lately I’ve been setting up our new hosting servers for the company im at because they trusted me enough to move from managed hosting environment to rented servers where we manage the hosting ourselves.
 Most hosting clients are past clients where we made their sites. We host a few hundred but obviously want to increase.
 Im looking into collocation, but honestly I’m super surprised at the cost of servers. We are in South Africa so there aren’t many big DC providers. So only when we get a few servers would we look at collocation, but how “worth it” is hardware like Xeon CPU’s? I see there are now some new Intel consumer level CPUs that support ECC, and most new AMD CPUs support ECC. So for largely Wordpress and NodeJS environments is there an issue with going with AMD? Is there something I’m missing?
 Honestly I’m just not sure where to start with hardware, I’ve learnt what I can in theory, but real world reasons for certain choices, and advice is very different. 
 This post was a bit of a ramble but I guess I’m just looking for any good nuggets from you pros 🙂

                              <span>Well, I might&#x27;ve messed up. I own an HP Envy x360 convertible for private use and apparently set an administrator password for it some day and well, being me, didn&#x27;t document it.
 Whilst I remember the power on password and can therefore still use this thing, the UEFI is out of reach for me.
 Is there any way, at all, to reset the password on a notebook like this, or am I forced to send it in? I&#x27;m no stranger to disassembling laptops, but would like to refrain from anything voiding the warranty (so soldering out EPROMs is out of question, unfortunately).

 In the last two companies, I&#x27;ve worked at I was never in DC. Then talking to a coworker at my new job this company has a lights-out policy where no one is allowed inside the DC except for emergencies or the planned maintenance window on the first weekend of the month. There are security guards at the gate but that is all. Even the operators work remotely. Exciting stuff!

Is there some kind of function in Windows that saves a certificate for a website locally, and uses it by default for a period of time? Is there a timeout that forces Windows to recheck/revalidate the cert on a particular website? and is there a way to force a client to ignore any cached certs and check the cert on the server instead? and what might happen if the client uses a cached cert?

 My concern is that I can&#x27;t find this drive listed anywhere on this website, is this going to be an issue or is the drive going to work just fine?
 Just want to clarify, I&#x27;m not using any HP drives on my system currently, just random ones I found, though those were listed on that website. This is for a home lab, nothing too serious or mission critical.

                              <span>I&#x27;m having this conversation now with a smaller shop. They want to set up a new NAS with RAID syncing to a second NAS at a remote site. They already had a setup like this running with WD Blue HDDs but it&#x27;s almost 10 years old and ready to update. The admin there read he needs &quot;enterprise drives&quot; and I&#x27;m like no you don&#x27;t. They are more than three times the cost of the SSDs in the drive and for this setup way overkill. 
 15-20 years ago when hard drives weren&#x27;t nearly as reliable I&#x27;d more inclined to agree but now not so much. Especially when the place I work at has well over a million SSDs and HDDs in their DCs around the world and all of them are your standard off-the-shelf Western Digitals or Seagates and it&#x27;s running fine.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a external 4TB USB Disc that goes to sleep when it is not accessed for a certain time.
 It this model in 4TB: https://www.tradeinn.com/techinn/en/intenso-memory-center-3.5-usb-3.0-6tb-external-hdd-hard-drive/137796299/p
 I access this disc via ISCSI on a Debian system. I noticed that this disc becomes unavailable as ISCSI Target, once it has gone to sleep because apparently the drive name changes and it gets a new device name usually the next free letter for example instead of /dev/sdd it changes to /dev/sdf messing up my targetcli setup.
 I followed advice and instead of the device name I pointed targetcli to /dev/disk/by-id/...
 But unforutnately that did not help either. After sleeping the disc will not be accessible on ISCSI.
 I&#x27;d prefer to have the Disc continue to go to sleep in order to save energy, but still want it to wake up and be available on iscsi. On windows, I also sometimes had issues with the disc not being detected anymore once it went to sleep. It usually helped to rescan for the USB devices to redetect the disc. Also manually reswitching the power button helped.
 Is there any way to make sure that targetcli keeps the external hd connected, even if it goes to sleep on Linux Debian/Ubuntu?

                              <span>Hi,
 I may choose a Dell Mobile Workstation for work. Does anyone have any experience?
 There are two for me to choose from:
 Dell Precision 3570
 Dell Precision 3571
 According to the following ranking, the 3570&#x27;s processor is ranked 47th and the 3571&#x27;s is ranked 1st, but the 3570 has 16GB more RAM (for a total of 32GB). 
 I use the Dell 27&quot; S2721DGFA monitor twice. The 3571&#x27;s graphics card is slightly better than the 3570&#x27;s according to the following ranking.
 No special programs are used. Office, browser, a few VPN clients, anti-virus software, vulnerability scans. I work a lot in the browser. Important for me is a good performance. That&#x27;s it. 
 My questions:
 Which one is better for very fast and reliable &quot;office&quot; work?
 What are the differences between the two?
 Or is it worthwhile to put one together yourself? That would look like this. However, I can&#x27;t find anything about the integrated Intel graphics card GT2 and I don&#x27;t know if it can handle two 27&quot; monitors.
 I am very much looking forward to your feedback and thank you in advance. :)

 So if you use site: in your google searches remember to change what you have been used to.
 And any some handy bookmarks you had from before will now give you a 404 page. But at least the 404 page usually gives you a link to the new location. Some old links, but not all, do redirect.
 EDIT: changed bookmark stuff based on u/lanathell&#x27;s feedback.

                              <span>Hi there, apologies if this is not the way to submit here. In our environment (mostly server 2012 r2 and 2016) we have a server that is used by a third party company to run reports. For this they require local admin access. About 6 weeks ago, three of these accounts stopped being able to launch most apps, all except for windows accessories and office 365 apps (fat)
 These users are members of the local admins group, they are also part of an ad group that is also in local admins. Launching any other application gives the error ‘this operation has been cancelled due to restrictions in effect on this computer’
 These accounts are only a problem with this server, it’s the only one they would normally access
 I’ve cleared down the local accounts from there, including the registry. I’ve also just created the default app locker execution rules in group policy. These accounts have full unrestricted access to the server but still can’t launch other applications and services. Unfortunately this includes CMD, so even running a gpresult is proving difficult. Anyone had a similar issue?

                              <span>Hi! I would like to know how you everyone here handles account reviews for VIP employees (in our case CEO). 
 We have to do a review of all accesses in applications in anticipation of an audit. We now take a report of each user and their access. Their managers review the access and tell us if some changes are needed. But the CEO has access to a few applications and we are not sure who should review his access. Someone at the Board? In AD he does not have a anyone set as the Manager.

                              <span>Hi, I work with Microsoft products like Azure, inTune, Dynamics and other 365 products to implement modern workplace solutions for our end users. 
 I find it sometimes difficult to have an overview of all future updates and end of life products that are being pushed by Microsoft. It would be nice to have this automated in some way.
 How do you guys manage this?

                              <span>Hi all
 I started new job, where I will need to do windows server, Azure Vm and VMware host patching
 there are very few servers no WSUS employed or anything else, because they will go away sooner or later 
 my manager asked me about my plan to patch those servers/hosts 
 they are mixes of dev and production 
 I am thinking:
 -Update windows servers when update released (every month) and when critical update is been pushed 
 -Create snapshot for VM before update (is this necessary?)
 -Update VMware server software when new update is released (minor updates for the same version)
 -Update the production servers off hours 
 -Test updates (by running the application and testing all functions)
 -Rollback update if test went wrong
 -For Switches, update one switch after making copy from configurations with old FW
 -Test the switches and be ready to rollback to backup file
 ​
 ​
 is there any ideas or things I need to add to the plan?
 ​
 thanks in advanced

                              <span>I still rock an old ass RRAS VPN on 2003 VM, obviously it has got to go... with that I have few choices, I can pay more for the already expensive barracuda firewalls to I believe give me a decent VPN client + single sign-on, I&#x27;m not sure how I would do 2FA with that but I assume it can do that as it has enough bells &amp; whistles to confuse me anytime I look at it. I also don&#x27;t look forward to deploying the client to my users, I love built-in windows VPN and it always treated me well.
 OR
 just a new 2019 VM with VPN and somehow enable 2FA on that. 
 OR
 the VM + I wouldn&#x27;t mind paying for DUO or something similar either, just not sure how that works to be honest with windows VPN server? can it? 
 what say you /r/sysadmin?

                              <span>I have seen a rash of bogus emails getting through our filters because its being delivered by DocuSign&#x27;s legitimate service/address *.docusign.com, *.docusign.net however the sender will be for example &quot;Chase Bank&quot; with a sender email in the body [00014745billing@outlook.com](mailto:00014745billing@outlook.com). Our users are opening them because they trust the DocuSign domain. The few I have investigated redirected to a 365 sign in when you click &quot;review document&quot; or to a static file with an incoherent message that I presume they are trying to get you to download. So I am assuming malware delivery and credential harvesting. All I can say is thank god for MFA and poorly designed fake documents. However I worry its going to hit the right person where the fake document makes sense, like a plausible contract, and the user actually downloads and opens. 
 Besides education is there a better way to lock this down other then blocking DocuSign and having to manually release.

                              <span>My employer has a presence in most major countries and is very encouraging of sponsoring its remote employees to move wherever they feel suits them best (with an adjustment in pay depending on the destination). 
 I&#x27;m in the US currently and while I&#x27;ve got great health insurance, I&#x27;d love to find somewhere with a sane healthcare system. Having lived somewhere with harsh winters, I&#x27;d prefer not to deal with those anymore. I unfortunately only speak English and have not had luck picking up other languages.
 If you could move somewhere warm and english-speaking-friendly, where would you go?

                              <span>Long story short, it&#x27;s a website meant for employees. But the public internet can access it as well.
 The problem is that they rolled out a update a few months ago where users don&#x27;t need to enter in a password to log in. I discovered this by accident.
 You just need the username, and the system will log you into the account, giving you information such as the employee&#x27;s addresses, contact information, payroll information and so on. Nor is there a &quot;too many attempts&quot; timeout, because I presume that was tied with the password.
 IT department at my office has no idea who to contact to address that issue.
 The website&#x27;s own contact email is never answered. When I called them and waited +3 hours on the line, the help desk person insisted that removing the password was a convince feature, not a …</span>

I would love to lay low for a few years and save cash, but don&#x27;t know if I would dig living in a small town. Just looking for opinions.
 EDIT: I would not be leaving the country or even my state. Just meant changing cities. I live in NC, so I could live at the beach, or the mountains, or stay in Raleigh, or move out into the sticks.

                              <span>Hey all - I&#x27;m trying to verify that our Meraki SD-WAN is actually utilizing the full bandwidth of our 2 500mb circuits and not seeing what I thought I would, so hoping for a suggestion. Doing an internet speed test yields the same result if I take one of the circuits out (approx 500mb up/down). The MX device shows that both circuits are active and it is set to load balance. That said, the device still makes you pick a &#x27;primary&#x27; circuit and seems to be using that one exclusively for my testing.

 I am aware there are POE injectors, I have them. But are there devices that negotiate POE with the POE-Switch itself and drawing power from the switch and not from a separate power source?

Does anyone know how with junos to chase down a mac/ip address once &quot;show arp&quot; or &quot;show ethernet-switching table&quot; gives the output of a lsi or vtep interface on the interface column?

                              <span>Hi there, I stumbled upon a P2P cli file transfer software named croc (https://github.com/schollz/croc), however there is some terminology in the read-me I couldn&#x27;t quite understand.
 Under the Self-Host Relay section it says:
  
The relay is needed to staple the parallel incoming and outgoing connections.
  
Now I did find articles on OCSP Stapling but this doesn&#x27;t seem to apply here (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong). In a blog post the creator, when talking about how croc works, explains:
  
There are better ways than sequentially uploading and downloading. Instead, you can use a relay server to create a full-duplex real-time communication layer between the two computers so that “uploading” and “downloading” occur simultaneously between the two computers.
  
Which in context sounds a lot like NAT hole punching. Is this just a misuse of the term stapling or is stapling something completely different / nonsense? Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Part of a company that has a main server then several departments that are connected via multiple switches and maybe 200m of ethernet cable. Each department has maybe 10-15 computers and multiple machines connected . The networking was done here and there and with different types of cable over the past 10 years. Now things are running slow in one of the departments. We planned to run a new cat6 cable (100m) directly to the main switch. Is it worth it? Is it better to have a fiber cable with a converter on each end between two switches? The main use is transfering small files between computers/machines but during peak hours when most people are connected to the network, stuff stops working well and connections get interrupted

 I have queries regarding the redundancy issue (cisco).
 Scenario: End Customer has Primary-backup set up. I have checked the configuration and found no redundancy protocol is used in it. (sh vrrp , sh glbp, sh standy have no results) .
 My Query
 1) Could the router have redundancy even if the above protocol is not used? (Is it thru the access list? route-map configuration ??)
 2) How to check if both routers are redundant?
 3) if Back to back access is unavailable, Could someone help with the configuration? (no physical cable is connected between both the device to get access to primary via backup or vice versa)

                              <span>For a university project, I built a network of 4 interconnected CISCO switches (2960), with one of them connected to a single router.
 I&#x27;ve defined DCHP pools on the router, and created five VLANs on the switches (using VTP) based on ports. I&#x27;m now trying to assign each DCHP pool to a VLAN, but I can&#x27;t find a solution to do so.
 For example, a user connecting on the port 1 (VLAN 1) would get an IP in the DHCP pool named &quot;VLAN1&quot;.
 Do you have any idea on how I could implement that on these switch?
 Thanks :)

                              <span>Bit of background about myself:
  
I&#x27;m a high school student, soon to graduate.
 I&#x27;ve had an interest in Network Engineering for about two years.
 I&#x27;ve developed knowledge in BGP (RPKI filtering &amp; MP-BGP), OSPF (multi-area &amp; summarisation), VPNs (WG &amp; IPsec) and some Network Automation (Python OOP stuff &amp; Drone CI/CD).
 Have picked up some Docker and Linux stuff as well.
  
I&#x27;m starting an internship at a High Frequency Trading Firm in London, with their network team. It&#x27;s likely that they will give me a return offer.
 I&#x27;ve looked into HFT networks and found that multicast is used a lot (to receive market data from exchanges). I&#x27;m planning to set up a multicast IPTV server and run some packet captures to become more familiar with it. Also, I&#x27;ve read whitepapers on the switching platforms that the firm uses.
 Is there anything major to HFT networks I&#x27;m missing?
 I hope this doesn&#x27;t break rule #5, I thought that r/networking would be the best place to ask about such a niche industry.
 Thanks

                              <span>I have this old windows 2012 server (I know, I know), it is configured and responding to an IP on the 10.8.1.x subnet, it is attached to a Cisco switch via cat 5e. It has several nics but only one active (not disabled). The server isn&#x27;t set up with any virtualization. The issue is that the switch is showing 2 Mac addresses coming in on the same port that the server is attached to, arp shows another IP address , associated with a Mac address that is sequentially 1 higher (last digit) than the configured nic on the server, it also has an IP address in the same subnet as the one configured on the server so it would appear as though it would possibly be a secondary port on the nic. The server responds to pings on this secondary IP, nmap scans show only udp 68 being open on this IP. Here is the weird part, the machine doesn&#x27;t show the IP being configured anywhere, ipconfig doesn&#x27;t even list the Mac nor the IP of this secondary IP. Running Wireshark while pinging the secondary IP shows what you would expect from a configured nic, except it isn&#x27;t configured anywhere that I can find...any suggestions on locating where this is coming from would be greatly appreciated.

 2) wifi2 and wifi3 works on the same frequency as the wifi1 and other users are also downloading something using those two wifi.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been given a relatively simple task at work but there doesn&#x27;t seem to be a software out there that seems to be able to achieve this and I&#x27;m scratching my head out.
 Essentially we want to build an IoT environment using MQTT as the message protocol. We want to model this environment and simulate the message flow &amp; bandwidth utilization. It&#x27;s a simple publisher &gt; broker &gt; multiple subscribers chain. 
 Our aim is to play around with the values and perform certain what-if scenarios. (e.g if there&#x27;s a message spike, can the bandwidth manage? How long would it take for all my subscribers to receive the payload?) 
 Is there a easy modeling tool that is able to do this? A simple system A sending data to system B. I can vary the bandwidth, payload size and frequency and output the bandwidth utilization

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been using OneNote for my own personal IT notes, specifically networking stuff. If I get shown how to do something, I write up the process. Same if I figure something out for myself, etc. Over 3-4 jobs now I&#x27;ve carried the same OneNote file with me and added to it, but I&#x27;m falling out of love with OneNote.
 I was thinking about an alternative like Evernote, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to have the same simplicity that OneNote has, sadly. If I could import my notes without having to copy-paste everything, I&#x27;d certainly give Evernote a try, but I like to have things organised under tabs (Network, Security, VMware, Wifi, etc) and have my various pages categorised that way. I&#x27;d also need to figure out if Evernote can do this too.
 What do you use for your personal notetaking? What does it do that you like? What does it do that you don&#x27;t like? Thanks for any input to the discussion.

 Client uses a service running on their server to monitor a folder and upload documents to a server over HTTPS.
 Pcap shows handshake looks good, TLS session is negotiated without issue, but once the actual file upload starts, things stop working right. The client will typically send 2-3 packets for any given chunk, but the server only ACKs the first packet. The client then retransmits the next two packets and then gets an ACK for each. So far so good - a bit messy, but at least traffic is flowing.
 Then we get to the very last packet - on the last packet of the session, we end up waiting for 35-40 seconds before we finally get an ACK from the server an…</span>

                              <span>EDIT:UPDATE-my question was answered and pointed in a better direction. Turns out I should have probably posted in a industrial automation sub. Thanks for the info. 
 Are there switches on the market that support RSTP with multiple rings in a switch. I am a design engineer for a BAS manufacturer and the industry is migrating out of rs485 twisted pair to using RSTP compatible switches with a Ring topology to keep costs low on the networking side. For example do switches allow you to set a root and backup port for multiple rings or are you limited to one failover port per switch. I imagine there are a wide range of options based on cost but this would be in the area of 3-5 rings per switch at most for very large networks. 
 To clarify the end goal is to move into An IP friendly physical layer that maintains the cost effectiveness of daisy chains while using ring topology to give a fail over route if the cable is ever damaged/or enough nodes fail we exceed 100m between devices that are online. 
 The current direction looks like a small 8 port industrial switch per network but I grow curious if there could be cost benefit to a single switch 18/24/48 port that could have multiple networks on 1.

                              <span>Just going to throw out a design question here. Recent internet access disasters have us rethinking our internet access methods. Has anyone ever tried to setup two different brands of Firewall brands. One hot and running. Another offline but ready to connect if the first firewall decides to stop working. I know the devil is in the details as far as setting this up but I was wondering if anyone has attempted this.

                              <span>I have no experience with Juniper&#x27;s MX204, but we are considering becoming a Juniper house.
 The platform advertises an impressive 400gbps of throughput but doesn&#x27;t give any background on where that number comes from. 
 In a layer 3 forwarding application are we really to expect 400gbps of throughput? Does anyone know what the realistic numbers might look like?

 I have one switch where when I SSH to the device I get username and password prompt. After that the connection closes without any indication why. This behaviour happens in SecureCRT and Putty. Console connections works fine. VTY config below looks ok to me but I&#x27;m not sure. Any ideas?

In the interests of spicing things up a bit around here, we&#x27;re going to try out a Rant Wednesday thread for you all to vent your frustrations. Feel free to vent about vendors, co-workers, price of scotch or anything else network related. 
 There is no guiding question to help stir up some rage-feels, feel free to fire at will, ranting about anything and everything that&#x27;s been pissing you off or getting on your nerves!
 Note: This post is created at 00:00 UTC. It may not be Wednesday where you are in the world, no need to comment on it.

                              <span>Hello r/sysadmin, I&#x27;m /u/AutoModerator, and welcome to this month&#x27;s Patch Megathread!
 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month&#x27;s updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft&#x27;s Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft&#x27;s updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn&#x27;t work.
 Test, test, and test!
