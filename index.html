                              <span>Hi, few days ago, for compliance reasons, I configured a GPO to force lock screen after 3 minutes at the top of my Active Directory. 
 Users are complaining that this time is too short, so I tried to raise it to 5 or 10 minutes... without any luck: workstations are still locked after 3 minutes and I can&#x27;t explain why.
 Currently I also unlinked GPO from my domain, rebooted workstations, run gpupdate /force multiple times... without success.
 For example, I just rebootted a workstation and gpresult /r tell me that GPO lock screen is NOT there.
 I guess there is something that I am missing in controlling what GPO are applied, and this is the most important thing I&#x27;d like to understand, not the specific case :)
 Any help in troubleshooting this? Thank you!

                              <span>This customer uses RDP (over Citrix) to connect to a financial service at an external party. They don&#x27;t logon using the DOMAIN\User format but the modern user@domain format. The username is abstract (think U2123651213132@acme.com) so they want the username to be saved by the RDP client.
  
 However, at logon time, it drops the last few chars of the username and fails logon. It tries to logon with U2123651213132@acm in one user, and U2123651213133@acme.c in another user. If they correct in manually, it works, but I don&#x27;t understand why it &quot;forgets&quot; a part of the user name. I&#x27;ve never seen that before. Maybe it has to do with Citrix, but to me it looks like Citrix just opens a VPN and then opens an RDP session.
  
 For Germans: this behaviour is when using Datev Smart-IT.

 our IT Team does not want to change the screen lock time of 10min for some our clients in production. Is there a software that can enhance this to 30min and simulate some video playback or keypress? It would be important that after 30min it locks and after unlocks the intervall sets again to 30min. 
 ​
 Is this possible with any software? With powertoys awake i can only set an intervall once and not after every login from screenlock.

 onetimesecret.com seems to be very popular in orgs i have worked at but it’s often misused (all credentials and urls in one secret) and it’s never sat comfortably with me using an untrusted 3rd party to transfer sensitive information.

                              <span>Recently came across a post and also heard some tech guys suggest using a blower to clean your hardware like servers and switches etc. 
 Running an air blower will just push the dust deep down to places where you can&#x27;t clean it further and cause heating issues and static problems. 
 I believe using a vacuum cleaner with hepa filters is the best way to dust your hardware.
 What do you guys use?

 I work as a senior technical sysadmin for a large university and i find myself slightly adrift here.
 Some backstory to set the scene.
 We had a major reorganization fairly recently that has taken about 20 or so smaller groups and one large and mashed into one massive group. Sadly, this was done with no plan or afterthough.
 Three years later what we have is basically yugoslavia in the 90&#x27;s. We lack many basic supportstructures and the infighting between teams, groups and departments makes me sad and depressed tbh.
 Noone wants to cooperate, everyone just keeps their head down and trudge along in the same old wheeltracks.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve run into a bit of an odd issue and would appreciate some input.
 I&#x27;ve got one of my clusters reporting the following error:
  
The computer object associated with the cluster network name resource &quot;SQL Network Name (---)&quot; could not be updated in domain &quot;---&quot; during the Password change operation. 
 The text for the associated error code is: The specified network password is not correct. 
 The cluster identity &quot;CNO$&quot; may lack permissions required to update the object. Please work with your domain administrator to ensure that the cluster identity can update computer objects in the domain.
  
Now, I&#x27;ve only seen this error posted with the &quot;Access is denied&quot; code, which usually is resolved by, well, fixing the access permissions that the CNO has on the other resources in order to update them. However, I fail to find anything mentioning my exact error with the incorrect password of the CNO account and a suggested solution for it.
 I&#x27;ve had a look at this with an external party suggesting we still work on the permissions the CNO object has in AD, giving it full control. But I like to avoid just tossing permissions at things hoping it works, especially because this error does not suggest a permission issue.
 I have found the following article, although without my error mentioned, but it makes the most sense (atleast for me) for the issue I&#x27;m facing: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/failover-clustering/understanding-the-repair-active-directory-object-recovery-action/ba-p/371891
 This suggests taking the Cluster Name resource offline and using the Repair feature, as this will apparently use the credentials of the currently logged on user to reset the CNO password and replace it.
 I&#x27;d like to have a second set of eyes on this, maybe someone has even had this issue before already. I&#x27;m not too well versed with Failover Clusters, but the suggestion of the external party doesn&#x27;t seem proper to me.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Before the changes made by CA/Browser around OV Code Signing certificates, I used to create a pfx from the certificate myself using the key I had generated.
 But since the 1st of June, these certificates are delivered to me on an eToken from our vendor. Therefore, I don&#x27;t have access to the private key file anymore.
 We need the pfx for our Microsoft 365 Business Central solution.
 I have already searched for multiple days without success.
 Has anyone had the same issue? How did you fix this?

 Has anyone enabled the patch? Did you notice any negative impacts once enabling the registry keys? 
 Depending on the Windows version running on your device, you will have to add the following under the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Policies\Microsoft\FeatureManagement\Overrides registry key:

I&#x27;ve been working on creating some cool CLI tools using Go, while Python comes in handy for automating those one-time tasks. Now, I&#x27;m looking for some suggestions and ideas on how I can further improve my sysadmin and DevOps skills using these languages. Do you have any projects or recommendations that could help me enhance my skills? Your input and insights would be greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi All, 
 First time posting here, I work in a Steel Warehouse with 5-6 computers. My manager wanted “more Ethernet ports” so he plugged in a HP ProCurve 2524 switch into the RJ45 wall port and then plugged it into multiple computers and phones with no result. He then unplugged it and tried to return everything to how it was and the EJ45 port seems to be dead. 
 I’ve now been tasked with fixing this as I’m the only person who has turned the router on and off before to fix the internet /s , but I’m completely lost with the intricacies of this. 
 Any help to get the wall ports working would be amazing :) 
 Thanks, Jacob

                              <span>Bit of a stupid question but.. when ordering a cross connect at a collocation/carrier facility would that typically include 2 fiber strands? Or is this where bidi optics can save $$?

                              <span>We’re setting up a tp-link vpn router for our small business office. Up until this point we used Comcast’s business class router/modem. We’re going to have the tp-link vpn router do the routing. To do this do we need to disable the DHCP IP routing on the Comcast modem or does it not matter? We just plug the modem directly into the the network input on the vpn router and have it do DHCP from there?

                              <span>In this particular instance, I&#x27;m looking to set up Universal Print to make finding and adding printers more self-service friendly for users as we move machines to be Azure AD joined only. Our print server is running on a 2019 Server Core VM. I can install the Universal Print connector service just fine, but I can&#x27;t register it with Azure because it wants to open a browser to handle the sign in process.
 On the other hand, the connector service for Azure AD&#x27;s SSO agent handles this registration process via Powershell. I can&#x27;t remember which, but I believe I&#x27;ve also encountered one that prompts you to open a MS login page on your workstation and gives you a code to enter. 
 I feel like of all the services to run on Server Core, a Print Server is high up there. It seems like laziness that the only reason the Universal Print connector doesn&#x27;t support Server Core is because it doesn&#x27;t have a browser to handle logging into Azure to complete the registration process. There&#x27;s even a Powershell module for managing the connector (such as adding printers to it) after it&#x27;s been registered! The UP team needs to talk to whichever team worked on the connectors for those other services and copy their registration process.
 Another one that seems lazy to me for similar reasons is the PowerBI data gateway. Once it&#x27;s registered, I&#x27;ve never seen the need to interact with it again. It SHOULD be able to be run on Server Core but once again, it doesn&#x27;t because rather than create a registration process via PowerShell they went the lazy way and required a browser based login.

                              <span>So, a few weeks ago I opened a switch to blow out dust and found two capacitors swollen and leaking. I&#x27;ve been busy and just opened a warranty case yesterday. Last night they responded asking for pictures of said capacitors.
 Today I got an email response saying that since I opened the switch case to blow out dust, my warranty claim is being denied and I should have called them before opening the case.
 I believe that this type of claim denial is illegal. So tomorrow I get to research the Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act and find the ftc ruling that was made in 2015.
 Not sure if I should post the name of the company. I&#x27;ll just say that several years ago they had LIFETIME warranty on their switches. 
 Who else blows dust out of gear as routine maintenance? Or how about doing it as when touched as non-routine maintenance?

                              <span>So I’ll try to make this brief
 The new Director is finally hitting their stride and is now beginning to map out the plan they have in mind.
 Part of this plan is to validate the need for VPNs due to them being a potential threat vector, but on the flip side wants to also revert back to RDS gateways because…..well I have no idea.
 The discussion of deep packet investigation came up as well.
 The director wants to be able to scan network traffic with DPI through the VPN tunnel to investigate if malware is present or not. From all the stuff I’ve known and read I don’t think DPI can read the data or packets in transit through the VPN tunnel but just see that there is data being sent/received?
 there are quite a few more things to get into but parenthood calls, but am I wrong to be challenging these decisions or discussions?

                              <span>I am reading that there is a min of 16 core licenses needed per server ( 8 cores per socket)
 We have 3 servers with 2 sockets each (but each socket only has 6 cores which is kind of lame but oh well.)
 That’s 48 core licenses we may need.
 We have 10 core licenses already.
 It appears we need to buy 38 more cores.
 2 core license packs can be bought for 93.00 each on tech soup
 (19) 2 core packs may be needed to give us 48 core licenses to cover all (3) 16 core machines and will cost $1,767
 Cost is way better than data center still
 Oh and each licensed hyper v windows server standard can run 2 VM’s so we have a total of 6 VM’s possible.
 If we want to buy another 93 dollar license and make sure that VM is only allotted 2 cores we can have more.

 Did I just give my boss the wrong info in my email above?

                              <span>As a daily routine, I glance over what got caught in the spamfilter to release false positives. One mail flagged for the &quot;naughty scam/spam&quot; category seemed unusual, since it came from the domain of another company in this city. Looked inside and saw a conversion + attachments that make it very clear that an affair between A and B is going on. 
 Main problem: The soon-to-be wife of A is a friend of mine, so I&#x27;am somewhat personally entangled in this. I dont know what or even if I should do something. Would feel awful to not tell my friend whats going on, but I feel like my hands are tied.

                              <span>Why can&#x27;t companies just do what they&#x27;re supposed to, and not be giant piles of shit?
 About a month ago I noticed an IP address that kept trying to establish a VPN to our office, over and over. Every 5 seconds.
 We don&#x27;t us IPSec for anything, so there&#x27;s no way it&#x27;s legit.
 So I look up the IP address, and it&#x27;s owned by Comcast.
 Fire off an email to their abuse email address, along with the logs.
 A month later, nothing.
 So I call their abuse number. Now, you&#x27;d think that with an automatized menu item labeled &quot;For malicious traffic originating from a comcast IP address, press 2&quot; they&#x27;d have some clue of what they&#x27;re doing.
 Not so much.
 After an hour on the phone, they give me a case number, and said that they&#x27;d escalate it, and I&#x27;d hear back from someone in a few days.
 8 days later, Nothing....
 So I call them again. Get hung up on.
 Call again, and get transferred to some poor tech in the xfinity department, who has no clue what&#x27;s going on... But he&#x27;s at least trying to help.
 I feel sorry for their actual customers.
 ​
 EDIT: Turns out we do use a single IPSec tunnel. So I was wrong there.

                              <span>3 Months ago I moved from my previous sysadmin job to start a new career as a cyber security analyst in an MSSP, they taught me alot of concepts and paid for courses to build my skills, we have a very nice management!! Yet there is alot of work pressure, sometimes I have to work even after working hours from home, and I don&#x27;t sleep well from the work pressure. well after 3 months in this MSSP I received a job offer for an Information Security Officer in a very well known bank, and they offered double my salary, and a better health insurance. I don&#x27;t know what to do, I feel like I am betraying our management if I accepted this offer because everything they asked me in the interview was what I learned from my management. what should I do ? do I accept the offer or not?

                              <span>Was contacted by the jittery micromanager of a department today to look into why her user wasn&#x27;t getting emails. 
 I asked her what email were they sending to and what email was the user checking? 
 We have two email accounts for all employees on for our company which is a contractor and the other is a county government email account that all employees receive once hired. 
 Turns out both the manager, and the clerk, and the receptionist were all sending from their county accounts to the company email. Our company has better security than the county so sometimes it is blocked. 
 I told the users to try sending from county email to county email, they all said it didn&#x27;t work because that user was never set up in county. I call county IT and they said she was set up. So I log in to test and all is good, but no one told me.... 
 I asked the users to test send to the county email as the user is set up, but they said it didn&#x27;t work. I had to go to each of their computers to show them how to type in the county email, because outlook likes to auto-populate the most common emails used. After I left their desks they still said it wasn&#x27;t working. 
 I reminded them that they have to type the email in a couple more times before it auto-fills. I wonder how any work actually gets done here...

 Me: “Hey John, thanks for reaching out about your issue. Is there a time later today or tomorrow morning I can reach out?”
 John: “Is now good?”
 No John, no it is not. 
 Bit of a silly rant and I’m grateful I don’t have more to rant about at the moment, but these start adding up and I just want to alt+f4 work for the day lol

                              <span>As the title suggests, struggling with a slight issue regarding how admin by request operates. 
 Essentially it removes the user from the local admin group and when requested by the user and approved it elevates the user. 
 Here lies the issue, we are trying to enroll the users in MDM (add work account in Microsoft settings / login to company portal) but it says the user needs elevation…
 Has anyone experienced this or know a workaround other than uninstalling the software which can have bad consequences or temporarily giving them a higher level admin access under supervision whilst setting this up? Both options are less than ideal but seeming not possible otherwise.
 Thanks any help is appreciated!

 If I do &quot;nslookup someothervpnclient&quot; it returns the correct IP address. However if I do &quot;ping someothervpnclient&quot; it can&#x27;t resolve the hostname. If I use the FQDN, eg. someothervpnclient.vpn.example.com, then it works just fine. Using &quot;ssh someothervpnclient&quot; won&#x27;t work either but it works with FQDN. 
 Wtf? Anyone got a clue as to why that could be? I&#x27;m confused.

                              <span>I won&#x27;t go into detail but we had a rogue employee let go the other day and we think the Spiceworks ticketing system is under their personal accounts. We have a backlog of old tickets in that tenant and we either need to get those old tickets exported to the company so we can import them on a new tenant or, need to get the existing tenant transfered to us.
 We&#x27;re still piecing things together but, we think the admin account is under his personal gmail account. Is this possible? I&#x27;m still dealing with this so I have not had time to go on and call Spiceworks myself.

                              <span>Hi. Hyper V server with a VM that will not boot due to maxed out hard drive space. Management would not approve additional resource spend for this because it is going away in 6 months. Anyways, there was 3-5GB left and I was going to do work on it this weekend to expand but Windows Updates wanted to ruin my day. It kept asking to update yesterday, which never happens. Was there some forced Windows 2019 sever update? It appears to have eaten up the rest of the disk space. 
 The VM is in a saved state, I’m nervous to delete that saved state without Hyper V experts telling me to do so. I see various recommendations by searching but nothing definitive. 
  
Delete the saved state, reduce the memory size (currently 29 GB) and boot up. Delete unnecessary files and expand disk size. Restore memory back to normal or…
 Delete saved state. Copy the VHD to an external HD, boot the machine to that. Delete unnecessary files and move back… expand for a permanent fix. I see two large files, what do I copy? The avhdx file or that and the hard disk image file? 
  
Please recommend what is best. I do have IT consultants helping but he is passing it to someone else who is more experienced with Hyper V. I’m worried that may take hours so I may need to work on this myself. Thank you

 Mine was about 15-16 years ago when I was on-call and a middle age guy called that everything was going the opposite way on his computer. After a couple minutes, I asked him if the mouse was upside down and he said, let me try it and said yeah and turned it the other way and he was so happy “I fixed it” lol. 
 I still had to log it in and get paid the 2 hour minimum.

                              <span>Hey all, I got a report early this week that one of our directors is having their inbox destroyed by solicitation emails. I believe they were accessing sites for recruitment and used their main work email. 
 I have some samples of the emails, and I can’t seem to find anything malicious about them. They’re legitimate, just extremely tenacious and annoying. I tried to look for a trend in them, so we could set up some rules to just delete them, but they don’t seem to follow anything scalable and they’re addresses are always different. 
 I looked in the exchange online portal, and the anti spam rules all seem like they’re for strictly malicious spam. I might be wrong, but I felt they wouldn’t be helpful. 
 I suggested that they just used the OWA to setup their own block/allow lists, but they can’t be bothered and wanted IT to do something about it. I’m kind of at a loss here. Is there anyway to get them out of this hole that I’m missing? Blocking the sending domains could be an option, but not all of them are things we would want to block. Like Glassdoor or legitimate recruitment sites that they and others might use. The worst is when the solicitors send meeting invites, they’re getting placed as tentative on the calendar. I got them out of that one with outlook calendar filters, but am clueless on the emails at this point. 
 Any guidance will be appreciated.

 Sorry my memory of doing this is a bit foggy. Last time I did something like this on my homelab was when I had ESXi 6.0 or 6.5 going to 6.7.

 Has anyone else come across this and if so what was the issue as im stumped. Both sites have a leased line, one is a sharp copier and the latter is a toshiba. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated:)

                              <span>&quot;I recently acquired a couple of T14 Gen3 Thinkpads, each pre-installed with a digital Windows 11 Home License.
 I intended to upgrade these to Windows 11 Enterprise by assigning an Enterprise License to each user and then logging them into their respective computers. Unfortunately, it appears that Windows 11 Home does not support organizational accounts.
 When I tried to reinstall the operating system, it simply reverted back to the digital Windows 11 Home License and i have no chance to provide another.

                              <span>Hey SA
 Hoping you can provide some insight or what things i can look for 
 Looks like one of our users was attacked and sent out a bunch of spam emails, cleaned everything up but looks like there was two authenticator app registrations that are from mobile a OS that the user doesnt use. Have since removed these
 The user had SMS authentication enabled 
 Have implemented geo blocking and will ensure legacy auth is disabled but my query is how would the attacker been able to register the authenticator app and pass the MFA check. Thought about sim swapping but the users phone is still working fine. Possible phised or MITM MFA? 
 The entry in azure ad states &#x27;User registered Authenticator App with Notification and Code&#x27; and from what i can tell was triggered from a browser client app

                              <span>Hey Everyone,
 I am currently a senior systems engineer and we have found out our company will be closing down over the next 6 months to a year.
 I have been in IT for nearly 20 years, with 12 years as a system admin.
 With some time to go before we finish up, I thought I would look at how to expand my skills and if there are any other areas I should look into. 
 My main focuses have been Virtualisation and Storage, with a bit of Azure work over the last few roles. 
 I have worked quite closely with security teams, and find some of that quite interesting, but have heard it can end up being mostly spreadsheets and less finding/fixing issues.
 Any Tips? 
 Thanks

And this employee put their cell phone number as the one that gets the verification code to access the admin center, but now I&#x27;m back and the employee is gone, and the cell phone number was cancelled so there&#x27;s no way to receive the SMS or call for verification. I have my email as the alternative email but the second verification is always by the cell number. I tried doing the forgotten password and have access to both of the alternative emails but the second step of the verification is to the number. I wanna know what are my options to regain access knowing that theres no way to get that number again. Thank you and this is not a hack attempt just an overwhelmed employee that was tossed a curve ball.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I have an incremental backup of 1500GB, which consists of around 17 million files, that needs to be transferred from one location to another location daily. Typically, I rely on rsync for file transfers, but it&#x27;s taking a considerable amount of time for calculations in this case. Therefore, I&#x27;m curious if there are better tools available for handling this massive task.Do you have any suggestions for alternative tools or techniques that can efficiently handle this transfer? I would greatly appreciate your insights!
 Thank you in advance!

 It happened a few weeks ago, then stopped, but seems to be back now.
 Happens in Edge or Chrome, and neither the browser versions nor the Outlook version has changed over that time, so I&#x27;m assuming it&#x27;s a change to the backend sharepoint code, although getting ms to admit that seems to be worse than pulling wisdom teeth...
 Usually, when you drag an email from Outlook to a location in sharepoint, it copies the mail, but seems to be performing a move instead.
 The mail does go to deleted items, but sometimes fails to copy correctly and leaves a corrupt file in sharepoint.
 Ctrl-drag does copy okay without deleting.

                              <span>Has anyone seen this before? I recently had to install a new version of windows 11 on my personal PC because my NVME died out, and now on this latest installation my RDP connection can take 30 minutes to connect to my work PC.
 It&#x27;s not Microsoft RDP specific, i see the same behavior if I attempt a connection via MobaXTerm. If i connect via a MacBook, it is instant. 
 I&#x27;ve tried with and without NLA turned on. 
 I just hang at &quot;Securing Remote Connection&quot; for ages

                              <span>Hi everyone! We&#x27;re a small company with 110 employees at the moment but still growing. Until now I&#x27;ve been on my own, and thus used Trello to organise my tasks, give priority and have a basic workflow.
 However, I&#x27;m not sure this is a scalable solution. I&#x27;ve talked with the head of my department and we want to look at a proper ticketing system. We&#x27;ve moven to Microsoft recently from Google Workspace and I want to know if there are solution out there that integrate particularly we&#x27;ll with this environment and apps like Teams. Prefer it to be a cloud-based application, would be a plus if they have a mobile app. Functionality we want ticketing and ITSM. 
 Does anyone have experience with this, and can recommend a package you&#x27;re satisfied with? I&#x27;ve looked around on the internet for the past couple of day&#x27;s and well, there&#x27;s a lot out there... And almost all look the same?
 Thanks for your replies in advance!

                              <span>Looking for input from anyone else that has dealt with this.
 A higher up at our company fell victim to an email hijack scam. Reviewing the messages, it is pretty clear one of the vendors involved in the email process had been compromised. 
 The email thread looks normal. The vendor requested and sent an invoice for payment on equipment.
 Two days later there was another follow up urging the payment quickly. The vendor also requested a change in ACH information. You can clearly see the email domain changed at this point and the language has the feel of poor translation. To me there were red flags at this point and had I been involved I would have urged a phone call to confirm the validity of the message.
 Another recipient on the thread from another company involved in this large purchase even doubled down on the payment request. Technically he was fooled too.
 So technically our systems were never compromised. But we are the victim since we made the false payment.
 Whose insurance gets involved here? I assume next step is to report this to the authorities. (local FBI cyber field office)
 Our company has traditionally not taken any of this seriously. I have managed to secure much of the infra a bit at a time with MFA, good AV and better policies. But my scope of oversight has never been able to influence finance and other at risk departments. Policies on ACH payments and convincing key departments to adopt things like password managers has been an uphill battle.
 Anyway, would not mind hearing how others navigated this.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hello, i have a question about Exchange 365 behaviour and hope that it&#x27;s ok to post it here directly.
 We have to migrate distribution groups from one domain to another.
 The way we do this is to rename the old group via EAC and create the new group in EAC with the new domain OU.
 We rebuild the whole group settings, add the members and secondary mail adresses.
 But now we have a big discussion about the X500 adresses in the secondary mail adresslist if we really need them or not. 
 Some years ago our exchange migrated to a newer version and therefore added the X500 adresses, the groups stayed the same.
 But with the completely new group and new SID, do we really need the X500?
 Does the new group will miss some data when we doesnt add the X500?
 Or do i have to update the X500 string to the new adress or sid for working with the new group? 
 Thanks for your time

 Following this guide (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/manage/centralized-deployment-of-add-ins?view&#x3D;o365-worldwide) it says:
 &quot;Centralized Deployment doesn&#x27;t support the following: Deployments of Microsoft 365 that do not include Exchange&quot;
 We have the MS Store blocked, so is there no way to deploy an addin from there without exchange online?

 want to build a platform to get the parameters of my company&#x27;s computer (CPU, memory, network card address, etc.), but I don&#x27;t need to &quot;manage&quot; it, I just need to be able to get it and save it in a database.Do I want to install fusioninventory on my computer and write my own php for the server instead of using the GLPI platform?

                              <span>Hi all,
 We are a small company looking to replace our aging wireless N APs and have been suggested Aruba APs. Our current access points (15 total) use external antennas and are fixed in some tricky places where removal is not going to be easy. If we get Aruba 534 or similar APs would these antennas work without issue? We likely won’t be utilising wifi 6 immediately and likely using 2.4ghz for a while longer due to the environment, but we have dying hardware that needs upgrading.
 Also what’s the cheapest method to manage these? Seems the cloud manager is a paid product, can a virtual controller be setup on Aruba?

                              <span>I have never been a part of a team that manages IDS/IPS and proxy servers. The question that I have is more related to applications like clientless remote desktop gateway such as Apache Guacamole, Kasm Workspaces, and clientless VPN.
 If the endpoints are configured to use proxy server with SSL decryption and going to a IPS/IDS appliance with SSL decryption, would the proxy server detect the clientless gateway like guacamole, Kasm and clientless VPN?

                              <span>Hello r/networking community!
 I&#x27;ve recently come across Netmaker, a networking solution that aims to simplify the creation and management of virtual networks using a decentralized approach. As someone interested in networking technologies, I&#x27;m intrigued by the concept and its potential benefits.
 Before diving in, I wanted to reach out to this knowledgeable community to gather insights and experiences related to implementing Netmaker. If you have any experience with Netmaker or have considered using it, I would greatly appreciate hearing your thoughts on the following:
 1. How does Netmaker compare to traditional centralized networking solutions in terms of scalability, performance, and resilience?
 2. What are some notable use cases or scenarios where Netmaker shines the most?
 3. Are there any specific challenges or considerations to keep in mind when implementing Netmaker, especially in a hybrid or multi-cloud environment?
 4. What are your experiences with the security features provided by Netmaker, particularly in terms of data privacy and integrity?
 5. Have you found Netmaker&#x27;s documentation and community support resources to be helpful during your implementation journey? 
 I&#x27;m eager to learn from your expertise and insights on Netmaker. Feel free to share any tips, best practices, or real-world examples that can shed light on its capabilities. Thank you in advance for your valuable contributions!
 Note: As a disclaimer, I am not affiliated with the Netmaker team and I&#x27;m solely interested in gathering community insights and experiences.
 Looking forward to an engaging discussion!

I believe the n9kv images are available for free but couldn&#x27;t figure out if that is possible. I see SR-OS is possible but images are not available without a license. Any help is appreciated please.

 Thanks in advance for any help on this.

                              <span>In company I work at some people are having stability problems with their mobile phones, the issue is simple, there&#x27;s a lot of people connected to the same router/access point (and honestly they&#x27;re the cheapest, company doesn&#x27;t want to pay for better stuff, actually they don&#x27;t and won&#x27;t pay). The company has +- 40 square feet (+- 3630 square meter) and there&#x27;s 7 routers/access points badly distributed (and sadly most of &#x27;em can&#x27;t be moved). Many departments kinda suffer from this bad distribution (and their devices also sucks, many smartphones don&#x27;t even support 5GHz making my job harder).
 For many months employers were dealing with this issue and ofc they complain a lot about it, heard one today, as expected, and an &quot;idea&quot; came in my mind, what If we use their PCs to route to their phone…</span>

                              <span>Hi all, I have endlessly browsed Reddit and other sites for advice or ideas on how to move forward with my current situation. But I figured the best course may be to ask flat out for advice 
 I started a Network Admin position recently, there is one other member on that team that was already there. The company I am working for is a rather large industrious company. They run 24/7 and hate stopping for maintenance, patching, etc. Because of this many of the IDFs and the MDF (for at least a couple of the locations) are a mess. Spaghetti everywhere, no labels, etc. the only reason it runs is tribal knowledge, nothing written or documented in any sense. I am tasked with documenting everything, organizing it, re doing any problem cabinets, and most important of all HAVING LITTLE TO NO DOWN TIME. I realize that there will be some necessary and will break that ice to the company. I just am curious if anyone has any advice for getting cables properly lengthen and swapped to new devices, centrally organizing everything, and just general cleanup? TIA
 Tl;dr: I started a network job, company hates downtime, all the cabinets are a mess and unlabeled, and my job is to clean it up

 but when i ping 1.2.3.4 directly, it is unsuccessful
 whats the explanation?
 is there something the dns server is providing other than the IP address for the name?
 is it something in the host file on the local machine maybe?
 What security mechanism is this? 
 any suggestions?

 If I wanted to plug a 10GB multimode SFP into a 1GB network module on a Cisco 3650, would I be able to get network connectivity.

                              <span>My security team asked me to look for a way to prevent users from interacting with the various AI style chatbots you see on webpages. Not chatgpt per se, but even the pop up chat bots that answer basic questions and have been around for years.
 My firewall vendor does not have any application controls, botnet detection, DLP etc that could target this web traffic, and official response from them is that it is not on the radar.
 -I might be able to discover some associated IPs and block them, but very manual and not robust.
 -May be able to find a user-agent string in http request to block. Maybe more success here but the same draw backs really.
 ​
 If you can think of any feasible approach I would love to hear it. Thanks!

                              <span>We’ve run into a curious issue where it seems a Cisco stack’s PVST (could be PVST+, will confirm) BPDUs are finding their way through an RSTP topology made up of Dell S4048 switches connected via 802.1Q trunks and hitting the upstream provider’s Ethernet access port. 
 The upstream provider’s switch turns their port to blocking mode due to receiving a PVST(+) BPDU on a non-802.1Q trunk, or so I’m told by the ISP. When we disconnect the Cisco stack from the topology, the upstream ISP’s MAC addresses appear on the network a few seconds later.
 Links go:
 Cisco stack (dot1q Po6) -&gt; Dell S4048 pair in VLT (dot1q Po27) -&gt; Dell S4048 pair in VLT (separate domain) (vlan 998 access) -&gt; upstream provider switches.
 The Dell switches use RSTP, PVST+ is not enabled on them.
 Is it possible for the PVST+ BPDUs from the Cisco to be passing through the dot1q links (Cisco to Dell to Dell) and then finding their way to the upstream ISP’s switchports which triggers their BPDU protections? I’ve read an article (https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/lan-switching/spanning-tree-protocol/24063-pvid-inconsistency-24063.html) which talks about PVID inconsistency.
 The ISP side has two L2 lines and spanning tree is used to control which line is used.

All have shared with me that ever since the cert issue a month back on the Vedges which caused client sites to go dark forcing them to upgrade all of their Vedges they have seen a big jump in potential clients reaching out to do a proof of concept for immediate replacement. My thought is this is possibly driven by upper management (business side), we as engineers sometimes underestimate the financial impact to a business in an event of an issue such as this. If your a VEdge customer what has been your managements direction after this issue if you were impacted?

                              <span>Hello All, I was wondering if anyone could give me tips on adding redundancy to our current network. We currently have an Active/Passive Fortigate cluster in place, however, below the Active/Passive cluster is our core switch which is a single point of failure. My goal is to make the core redundant, I was thinking of purchasing two Aruba 3810M&#x27;s and stacking them via backplane, however, I have also thought of just not stacking them. Please see my concerns below and feel free to share your opinions.

 ​
  
I understand that stacking at the core isn&#x27;t the greatest idea, because of the shared control plane, however, we aren&#x27;t a 24/7 facility, however, I do like the sounds of being able to update the core switch and not having to worry about the network going down.
 Reguardless if I stack or don&#x27;t stack the L3 switches, will I need LACP to go from the Firewall to my L3 core switches?
 What&#x27;s the added complexity with not stacking the switches? I believe that stacking the core switches and making one logical switch reduces config complexity, right?
  
​
 What do you guys think, should I stack at the core or keep the L3 switches separate? What protocols/technology would you put in place to achieve this? 
 ​
 Thanks for reading my post, I am looking forward to everyone&#x27;s feedback from the community!

                              <span>For all of those people that use solarwinds here, which flavor of solarwinds do you use?
 I have solarwinds network toolset installed (just installed today) on a windows server and our requirement is to monitor bandwidth on our edge routers and send email alerts when it goes beyond a certain threshold, can this tool do the job? I see a bandwidth gauges but don&#x27;t know if this tool can then send alerts via email, will have to play around a bit. I am used to the solarwinds NPM tool and I know that you can do bandwidth monitoring and stuff like that on this tool so if solarwinds toolset turns out not to be the tool we want then will have to buy the solarwinds NPM.
 Thank you

                              <span>Hi, long story short i&#x27;m studying POE power delivery so I can use it on custom designed networked electronic devices but I have a few doubts on what to expect from comercial PSEs and I figured this would probably be the best place to ask.
 My main doubts are understanding the default settings and user-changeable options when dealing with off-the-shelf PSEs.
 Since I don&#x27;t need 1gb I&#x27;m just focusing on 100base.
 As Alternative A and Alternative B aren&#x27;t part of the POE negotiation PSE&#x27;s can just be compatible with one of them but devices are probably recommended to be compatible with both? Or is it easy to find/set what wiring scheme the PSE is set to?
 And regarding Passive POE, disregarding injectors, are they all set to on by default? It seems possible to turn off/on by the user in some models/brands?
 Thank you.
 Edit: Oh, one more thing. Haven&#x27;t really dealt with POE devices yet but from my understanding of the thing, the POE controller needs power for the POE negotiation before power is made available through the ethernet connection right? Do you guys happen to know where the chip usually gets it&#x27;s power from when a purely POE powered device is first hooked up? Small internal rechargeable battery or something of the sort?

                              <span>TLDR; Simulating a L2 Leaf Spine NW in GNS3 in preparation for a network re-architecture at work. The two spine switches seem to both forward any routed traffic. Can&#x27;t figure out why, and was curious if anyone here encountered this before or know if its possibly a problem with GNS3 and wouldn&#x27;t happen on real devices?
 More detail:
 Small network I am currently simulating in GNS3 to learn more about how to implement L2LS consists of 2 spine switches (VLT Pair), 1 standalone leaf switch, and 2 leaf switches that are a VLT pair. OOBM switch in place for VLT backuo links
 I have 2 VLANS i am using to test routing. On each leaf switch I have two docker containers connected to it on each vlan. I am not yet testing any kind of VLT port channel from leaf switches to &quot;server&quot; just single connections for now.
 LEAF1-P1 -&gt; SPINE1-P1 LEAF1-P2 -&gt; SPINE2-P1
 LEAF2-P1 -&gt; SPINE1-P2 LEAF2-P2 -&gt; SPINE2-P2 LEAF3-P1 -&gt; SPINE1-P3 LEAF3-P2 -&gt; SPINE2-P3
 SPINEX-P1 are in VLT-PC1 SPINEX-P2/3 are in VLT-PC2 LEAF2/3-P1/2 are in VLT-PC2
 VRRP setup on SPINEs with virtip 192.168.X.1
 On Leaf1 I have a docker container with IP 192.168.2.50 trying to ping the docker container on LEAF2 with IP 192.168.4.51
 When that happens I get 3 duplicate responses.
 Basically what is happening is that SPINE1 (the main VLT/VRRP) gets the packet to be forwarded from VLAN 2 to VLAN4, and routes it appropriately. SPINE1 then sends that packet over VLTi to SPINE2, and then SPINE2 ALSO routes and forwards that packet. So the 192.168.4.51 gets 2x ping request. THEN, the same kind of doubling occurs on the response back ending uo with 4 responses sent to 192.168.2.50.
 Has Anyone seen this before? Is this expected behavior and I am messing up by trying to do L3 routing in a L2LS Network? Im basically the only networking person on my program, so sadly I do not have any way to bounce ideas off a true netwrok engineer other than going to the internet

                              <span>Hi all!
 We&#x27;ve just installed 2 Firebox T80 in HA and since 3 Internet connections arrives in VLANs and only 1 with physical cables (the router is right there), it would be easier for me to use VLANs inside the firewall too instead of transform them in physical cables in the switches (double because the firewalls are 2).
 It&#x27;s been suggested to me that it&#x27;s better for the Internet lines to be connected as physical ports instead of VLAN, but is that true? What are the cons in using VLANs (beside the limit of 1Gbps that I wish I could saturate with the Internet lines!)?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello everyone
 I&#x27;ve just unboxed some new N9K-C93180YC-FX3 V01 and N9K-C93108TC-FX3P V03. The plan is to use the 180 as parent switches and the 108 as fex (software fex mode). The thing is, i just can&#x27;t get these things to run and can&#x27;t find anything related to my problem with cisco documentations etc.
 The switches are running a newer software release than required per fex compatibility matrix.
 The 108 are configured in software FEX mode as per cisco documentation.
 switch(config)# write erase
 switch(config)# no boot nxos
 switch(config)# copy running-config startup-config
 switch(config)# boot fex
 switch(config)# reload
 ​
 The 180 parent switch is configured as follows:
 switch(config)# install feature-set fex
 switch(config)# feature-set fex
 switch(config)# interface port-channel 113
 switch(config-if)# switchport
 switch(config-if)# switchport mode fex-fabric
 switch(config-if)# fex associate 113
 switch(config-if)# no shut
 -----------------------------------------------------
 switch(config)# interface ethernet 1/49,ethernet 1/50
 switch(config-if)# switchport
 switch(config-if)# switchport mode fex-fabric
 switch(config-if)# fex associate 113
 switch(config-if)# channel-group 113
 switch(config-if)# no shutdown
 switch(config-if)# exit
 The fex is just not coming up, the interfaces stay on not connected states (Connected via port eth1/49 to 1/49, 1/50 to 1/50 using QSFP-100G-CU5M DAC Cable) . Has anyone any ideas what might be causing this?

 So I&#x27;m hitting an issue. I&#x27;ve created a hub and spoke custom centralised route policy matching a spoke site list with two spoke sites and adding the next hop as the hub TLOC.. but on the spoke sites they are not learning other spoke routes still...only the hub hosted routes. We are also using dia at the spoke sites so as it&#x27;s not learning other spoke routes it&#x27;s taking the dia route.

                              <span>We work with an msp who gives us access to their hosted unifi controller. This msp uses the controller for several clients of theirs and occasionally I will see devices available for adoption come across on my site. Our business has our own site, we can only see and manage our own devices, no other clients. 
 The other day I was trying to add a new ap and another client was obviously doing the same thing. They ended up adopting my AP and it started broadcasting their wifi network. 
 It got me thinking is this normal or is our msp missing something with their controller config.

                              <span>We have a grandstream VOIP system we swapped for a previously working nortel system. One segment is shared by another vendor/entity. They have cisco 2900 switches. Durring business hours, every 4 or so minutes all devices on the phone vlan (10) drop all traffic for about 10 seconds then come back. All the computers on the default network plugged into the PC side of the phones stay up and work fine. 
 Our down stream device is a UNIFI 24 POE with VLAN 10. Tested both as a trunk and an access port both have the same result. Every 4 minutes all vlan traffic drops. 
 ​
 Troubleshooting has been limited. We have no access to the cisco equipment so i&#x27;m looking for suggestions to have them look for or even us. 
 Tested so far. We added a UNIFI switch directly in their cabinet. (to eliminate the 168ft CAT 6 run). No ports ever drop on anyone&#x27;s equipment.
 We have constant pings going to all phones and changed that to 4096 packet size to see if it was exhausting some sort of buffer. That didn&#x27;t change the frequency of the drops at all. 
 That&#x27;s pretty much it. The other guys have just swapped from trunked traffic to access port traffic. They have no idea what is really happening on their side.

Any features that are a must that you enable? DNS? DHCP? Etc? Anyone in Cisco world using DNAC to PnP join and deploy out your config template?

In the interests of spicing things up a bit around here, we&#x27;re going to try out a Rant Wednesday thread for you all to vent your frustrations. Feel free to vent about vendors, co-workers, price of scotch or anything else network related. 
 There is no guiding question to help stir up some rage-feels, feel free to fire at will, ranting about anything and everything that&#x27;s been pissing you off or getting on your nerves!

                              <span>Not sure if anyone can help with this. I have limited experience with networking. 
 I have a 100ft Cat6 cable with Neutrik Ethercon ends. Im using it for live video production. My system limits me to using 180ft of cable or less. Which a 100ft cable should be just fine for. However these cables are not working.
 When I test the cables with my Klein Scout Pro 3 it tells me the cables are 197-200 ft long. I know for a fact they are 100. I suspect this has something to do with my signal issue. What could be causing this?

                              <span>Hi y&#x27;all! 
 I&#x27;m changing the networking components at a nonprofit I work for. Their current set-up includes 3 netgear nighthawk routers (one per building) and those are connected to unmanaged gigabit switches (also from netgear) and one main Dell switch from like 2008. 
 They have unmanaged switches everywhere since the main building was built back in the 50&#x27;s. None of the cabling has labels and its basically a sh*tshow.
 Anyways, I&#x27;m trying to replace everything and basically start brand new. I&#x27;m looking for recommendations on routers and switches. Right now, we have a nighthawk RAX70 router in the main building and that connects two outerbuildings, one with a nighthawk AC1900 &amp; the other with netgear r6120 acting as AP&#x27;s. 
 What are the things I should take into consideration when looking for new routers and managed switches? I know I need gigabit ports. We have about 50 users spread out in these buildings that require reliable connection. I was looking into the Cisco router firewall plus gx50, but this does require a subscription. Also the Cisco 1000 series for the switches.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been in the field for a number of years at this point, and I&#x27;ve noticed that without fail in mailing lists, there&#x27;s always a snarky comment or 10 whenever QUIC is discussed/debugged. To me, it seems more than general aversion to new technologies, even though it overall seems better than using TCP in most applications. Is it just part of the big tech hate?
 As someone who works a lot with traffic optimization over the public internet, I have found using QUIC to be immensely more useful to me than dealing with pure UDP or *shudder* TCP.

 The switch is on .1 and the firewall/router is at .252 for both of the subnets. The firewall/router and AP are both FortiNet.
 Port 48 is my uplink, port 46 is my AP.
 AP is currently broadcasting the guest SSID on VLAN 124 and the corp SSID on VLAN 0 (to avoid double tagging).
 Data SSID works great, but I can&#x27;t get DHCP on the Guest SSID and I&#x27;m just flabbergasted. The firewall never even sees the request.
 Does anyone have ANY clue?

                              <span>What do you recommend for out of band serial console servers with LTE built it and why?
 The digi product line looks to be low cost and commerical. $165 for a 1 port console server with LTE built in. As does a 4 port for under $500 new. https://www.digi.com/products/networking/infrastructure-management/console-servers 
 Is there anything else even at or in this price range?

                              <span>After a lot of troubleshooting, I figured out our Catalyst 9500 is dropping DHCP helper packets, causing clients obviously to fail. This happens cross vlan, and even cross VRF - so on the whole router. We have isolated and can recreate and verify that the reason is a HDMI-to-IP AV device that is using broadcast. We can through inspection of the COPP control plane policy commands see that the router is dropping BROADCAST (Policier Queue 0) packets.
 I have to say I am a bit surprised to see the 9500 has default only 750pps rate limit for broadcast globally. How are people handling this and making sure bugged traffic, DoS or even just AVoIP devices doesn&#x27;t stop DHCP relay from working &quot;globally&quot;?
 The traffic is not DHCP traffic, it&#x27;s UDP 192.168.0.1-&gt;192.168.0.99, but the L2 destination is ffffff-ffffff. And port is not 67/68. I&#x27;m struggling to understand why the Cisco would even queue these packets for CPU handling?
 Anyway, I know I can rate limit the specific client and what not, but I want to know what is best practice for single users like this not killing a several 1000-user network.. Seems like a bad design on the Npu-&gt;cpu from Cisco&#x27;s side?

                              <span>Hello everyone! Just wanted to see if anyone else has ran into anything like this and what the solution was. Like the title says, we are trying to establish a 10gb link to another site via our ISP. The issue that we have run into is, our 10gb link is active and working, however we are only able to pass 2gb of traffic because all traffic going to the handoff device is coming from a single source mac address. Since it appears to be one source device, our ISPs link policing is forcing a 2gb flow limit. Would the best way forward be to add some sort of load balancer between devices that splits the single flow from the our device into 5 individual flows so that we can appropriately take advantage of the 2gb flow limit? At a loss here.

                              <span>Hi guys. I’m using now 255.255.254.0 as new subnet mask @ my office. So if i’m not wrong i’m going from ex. 10.0.0.1-254 and 10.0.1.1-254
 The question is:
 Client 10.0.0.5 is going to ping 10.0.1.17 for example?
 Smb protocol will act same way? I will able to open a folder 10.0.1.5/folder from 10.0.0.8?
 Sorry if i was not clear enough, trying to learn.

                              <span>Sorry, not sorry for the clickbaity title.
 But IMO after I had an opportunity to truly digest Service Mesh, I’ve always felt it to be similar to traditional VPN technologies.
 Folks may disagree here but hear me out for a second.
 Today’s set of VPN tech is plentiful, we have IPSec, wireguard, overlays like Geneve, and other proprietary solutions that connect two disconnected networks. But from Layer 3 (4) and below. 
 So service mesh enters the chat and addresses connectivity but at L7/HTTP. Tunnelling exists through mTLS, and Istio/Linkerd have their way of making this possible. Side-car proxies act as routers on behalf of containers pods and terminate at another side-car
 But what else does a service mesh do? - rate limit (qos) - traffic shift - load balance - filter by http request type - give us tracing and observability thanks to b3-header info (L7 traceroute) 
 Of course there still needs to exist a TCP (and below) layer for all of this to happen…
 And DNS.
 So my two questions: 1. Why am I not seeing more Networking Engineers embrace the likes of Istio/Linkerd? (Maybe I’m in some echo chamber)
  
How do you all feel about Service Mesh?

Usual suspects, Lumen, Zayo, ATT, Sprint(tmobile) Comcast...
 Would like to build something into a list and then down the road, automate Solarwinds maintenance status of circuits based on reported circuit providers maintenances with SWIS API. They ask every quarter to drive down ticket volume/noise/MTTR.
 Just as typing this, a Zayo postponement came in, reminding me how complicated this may be.

 I&#x27;m a networking guy (Cisco and Juniper mainly), but never in my 10+ years have I had to deal with multicast. I have a Windows 10 device that I need to have one of its interfaces join a multicast group in order to see SAP video streams in VLC, and I am at a complete loss. 
 Multicast IP: 224.2.127.254
 Interface name: Cameras P1P2
 Interface IP: 192.168.111.11 
 I&#x27;ve been trying the following command lines, and they are all failing:
 netsh interface ip add v4multicastaddress &quot;Cameras P1P2&quot; 224.2.127.254
 netsh interface ip add v4multicast &quot;Cameras P1P2&quot; 224.2.127.254 
 The commands are failing after &quot;netsh interface ip add&quot;, with Windows telling me the only available commands that follow are: address, dnsservers, excludedportrange, neighbors, route, and winsservers. This has been stumping me for days, and hoping to get an idea of where to go next.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I heard good stuff about Backbox, but I can&#x27;t find any info an pricing on their website. And I don&#x27;t want to contact them or get a trial or what ever. I can&#x27;t stand another sales mail from another vendor. 
 How does the licensing work? What are the costs? Could we use it for many different switches/routers that are changing constantly? (that means, always other boxes). 
 Would be really great if someone could give me an inside if backbox could be an option.

                              <span>So how do you guys have your solar winds setup? Planning to install solar winds on a VM in Cisco ucs and what vlan should I put that under? Just create a separate vlan for this and then make sure that this vlan is present on all uplinks of all switches/routers? 
 We would not want to use a server vlan (where we have other servers) for solar winds in the ucs right? So it would need a different vlan? To keep it isolated?
 Thank you

                              <span>Hello, we have a problem with the correct NAT of traffic in this case - Wireguard client VPN connection to networks reachable behind the IPSecVPN tunnel. 
 The 172.16.0.0/24 network is the client VPN address. It connects to a VPN server that has access to local VLANs 192.168.0.0/24, 192.168.10.0/24 - this traffic is carried out correctly. However, the Wireguard server itself also has an IPSec tunnel set up to the 10.168.106.0/24 network and traffic from 172.16.0.0/24 to this network does not work.
 In the second phase of IPSec there is no client VPN class - 172.16.0.0/24 and I can&#x27;t add it because I don&#x27;t have access to the other side, so it can be done through NAT addressing 172.16.0.0/24 to any address that exists in the second phase, e.g. 192.168 .10.250 if traffic is routed to 10.168.106.0/24.
 Unfortunately, I don&#x27;t know which iptables rules I should use to implement this.

 By what I understood in an article I read, virtual MAC addresses start with 00:00:5E ..not sure this is correct. I guess any MAC address starting 00: is a virtual address?
 Any insight much appreciated.

                              <span>Hello, 
 is it possible to run power cables and shielded ethernet in the same conduit?
 having it separate would require an insane amount of work (destroying 150 meters of courtyard)
 I do have a conduit of 25 meters in which I&#x27;ve to run:
 -4 PoE++ cables
 -2 PoE+ cables
 -380V 10kW (grid to laboratory) - this could be 220V if needed
 -380V 20kW (pv system inverter to grid)
 At my disposal I do have those 2 ethernet cables
 https://eu.store.ui.com/eu/en/collections/unifi-accessory-tech-cable-box/products/unifi-outdoor-cable
 and
 https://www.assmann.com/product-pdf/4016032344063?PL&#x3D;en
 for what concerne power cables I still have to buy those and if there&#x27;s anything that would allow to run both in the same conduit I&#x27;ll get.
 which ethernet would be the most suitable? in case theres an ethernet cable better than mine let me know
 one end of the poe cables will be on cameras / switches while the other end will be on a server rack that is already grounded.
 patch panels in the rack is grounded, but most likely those cables will be directly terminated into unifi switch pro 24 poe.
 considering that the patchpanel is grounded and everything is made of metal is it fine to terminate those cables directly inside the switch?
 It would be ok to put another grounded patch panel in case its needed. I cant use tho the current one as it is already full
 Thank you

                              <span>Hey all, hoping to get some info from PA experts from this sub.
 I am trying to understand how the self-signed certs on the Palo Alto gateway are trusted by the Global Protect client when they authenticate and sign in.
 Basically with one of our fw setups, the gateway has a cert that is self signed by the firewall itself. When we connect to the VPN, there is no ssl warning prompt for the cert being untrusted. 
 I have checked that the root CA (also self signed by PA) is not present on the client machines. 
 If this is the case, is there any significance of having this cert setup correctly? Does the client just accept the cert no matter the details.
 I have noticed, that when we first add the portal IP, there is a warning only initially but no warning when connecting to the gateway.
 I tried looking at docs but couldn&#x27;t find what I was trying to understand here. Any info would be helpful.
 ​

                              <span>Hi All , im working on a problem where we have a pair of checkpoint firewalls in azure doing HA with load balancers , we followed this Architecture framework Network (checkpoint.com) .
 The problem is one of the Firewalls failed over (Cluster member didn&#x27;t actually fail) and the backend load-balancer is still pointing to the Primary firewall (now standby) which is breaking lots of our ssl connection&#x27;s understandably so
 We can just fail back however im wondering if its possible for the load balancers to detect HA state instead of probing if a member is alive

 ​
 Sorry if this is the wrong sub to post this but having some issues with our Palo Alto&#x27;s. The PAN-DB cloud is connected, but all URLs are coming back as not-resolved.
 ​
 Does anyone have any suggestions on how I can troubleshoot this further?
 ​
 TIA

                              <span>We have an IP range 103.180.31.0/24 provided to us by an IRR and the connectivity is provided by an ISP. The problem is that anything hosted on that IP range is not accessible outside of India. However, DNS works, IP will be resolved but the page won’t load. The browser gives request timed out error. I have checked in firewall there are no geo blocking policies enabled. Can someone tell me what’s wrong? Is there is a blocking from ISP side?
 P.S. everything works fine if anything hosted on that IP range is accessed from India.
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Home lab, so I did this to myself.
 One Proxmox server 10.0.0.17:8006
 I built another Ubuntu server (not on Proxmox) and gave it the same IP. Oops, removed server (Off)
 Except now, Macbook with Firefox cannot reach 10.0.0.17:8006 even after reboot
 Mint laptop with Firefox - no problems, brings up management console. WHY???
 I&#x27;ll look past the jokes about the Macbook Air (I know...)
 I&#x27;ve tried clear cache, private window, nothing seems to work. It&#x27;s not OMG critical, but never seen this in all my years (Arp cache??) Looking for ideas. Thanks!
 Update EDIT: The answer was Arp cache!
 How on a MACbook Air? Interestingly, opening a TERMINAL and typing 
 &gt;arp -a
 does not show that IP address in the list.
 However: &gt;sudo arp -a -d
 cleared all entries, and now it works.
 If anyone else finds this problem, think of ARP similar to DNS:
 DNS will take a domain name (dell.com) and translate to an IP address.
 whereas ARP will take an IP address, and translate it to a MAC address on the local network.
 So: proxmox.domain.local &#x3D; 10.0.0.17
 and 10.0.0.17 &#x3D; e3:d4:ac:f4:39:0a
 And this ARP table on the MACBOOK had the incorrect MAC address.
 clearing the ARP cache with &gt;sudo arp -a -d
 cleared that table and let the MAC re-ask where that IP address was.
 Thanks to everyone for troubleshooting!

                              <span>My company requires all salaried and hourly employees to fill out time sheets. 
 How many of you salaried employees have to fill out timesheets to show all the work you did for day and account for all of your time during an 8 hour workday?
 When I questioned this, their excuse is &quot;to show how profitable we are as a company&quot;.
 This does not include any after hours work &quot; That just expected since we are IT&quot;. 
 We were just asked to now itemized everything we put in our ticketing system and put it into a separate &quot;time tracking&quot; application outside of our ticketing system. Here the thing we already track our time and document everything in our ticketing system. Why should we have to do this twice?
 Am I crazy to be getting upset about this or is this normal?

 I want to compare two CSV files - in case there is a match update the existing column with values &quot;X&quot; and create a new CSV file.
 Here my attempt ...
 $ht4 &#x3D; @{} Import-Csv &quot;PATH-TO-CSV-FILE\file1.csv&quot; | ForEach-Object { $ht4[$_.Value1] &#x3D; $_.Value1 } Import-Csv &quot;PATH-TO-CSV-FILE\file2.csv&quot; | Select-Object *, @{Name &#x3D; &#x27;Action&#x27;; Expression &#x3D; { If($_.Value1 -eq $ht4[$_.Value1]){ &#x27;X&#x27; } Else { } } } | Export-Csv -Path &quot;PATH-TO-CSV-FILE\file3.csv&quot; -NoTypeInformation 
  
file1.csv contains:
 column: Value1
 data: A B C etc...
  
-------------------------------
  
file2.csv contains:
 columns: Test1 Test2 Value1
 data: A B C etc...

                              <span>TL;DR: longtime sysadmin leaving job due to disrespect from old school manager who should&#x27;ve retired 2 years ago. anyone else doing the same? (multi-campus higher ed w/ 700+ employees, 20k students) (probably whiny sh!tpost coming) 
 the story: 
 I have spent my adult life building my career at my current job and am leaving after a multi year decline in the quality of decision making and employee relations failures of the head of the IT department. 
 The last 4-6 years have been marked by terrible decision making, &quot;Do as i say not as i do&quot; behavior, unchecked absenteeism (the dept head is known across the college for never being in the office, we don&#x27;t allow work from home anymore) 
 one case study: He has assigned the sysadmin/netadmin team not only answer the helpdesk tech phone calls (one person per day every day) but the main number for the institution under the guise of being unable to staff the Service Desk (despite never even trying to hire and cutting hours of those we already employ) when we were told we were going to fill in we were given reasoning that the SC was getting blasted with calls and voicemails and we were a temporary stop gap. that was 6 months ago. there have never been reports produced with the actual metrics or progress made. no positions for the entry level job have ever been posted and now 6 months of this have gone by with little to no sign of it ending. HR is impotent as they&#x27;ve said they don&#x27;t want this happening but it continues. the VP above has made promises to &#x27;put a stop to it&#x27; yet it continues. 
 this is but one in a litany of examples of this toxic and abusive behavior, and an opportunity came up, so i took it. might recruit the rest of my team to come along... JB? KV? MG? (i know you will see this)

                              <span>I am trying to set a windows theme on login for all users, I have tried GPO and it has been a mixed bag on it being reliable. I have a working batch file in the common startup that fires:
 u/echo off
 start &quot;&quot; &quot;C:\Windows\Theme\ponsys.deskthemepack&quot; &amp; timeout /t 3 &amp; taskkill /im &quot;systemsettings.exe&quot; /f
 ​
 Works great except the cmd prompt pops up and is visible to the user, I have heard about running powershell scripts with the hidden window flag but I dont know powershell well at all. Does anyone have some suggestions on an avenue for this. We are using individual machines so I dont have a way to manage these pcs but at an individual level hence no domain based GP. Thanks!

                              <span>SOLVED: I have seen the light, and it is a re-image. Thank you!
 I&#x27;m repurposing some laptops, so that they can be used by another user.
 First one: I log in as a local admin. I disconnect the computer from Azure Active Directory. But I still see the former user&#x27;s files in C:\Users\HerUsername.
 I proceed to manually delete that directory, so that the next user won&#x27;t see them (yes, they&#x27;ll be a local admin, and yes, we will discuss that, but in a later post!).
 After those files are deleted, User comes to me and says all of her documents just disappeared. And two other users tell me that their Sharepoint library&#x27;s files have disappeared.
 After a mild panic attack, I restored everything, except files that had been modified that day (Onedrive only restored up until last night&#x27;s files).
 So, I gather that:
 Even after disconnecting from Azure, files that were synced to a computer are still there, AND if I manually delete them, they get deleted everywhere??
 Is this by design? If so, how can I un-design it?
 How am I supposed to transfer a laptop to a different user (again, for now, they&#x27;re both local admins)?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>Management has engaged a MSP to provide a secondary backup of our NAS. We already do the 3-2-1 backup strategy in house but I have no problems with another layer of backup if it&#x27;s not my money. However, the MSP is forcing us to buy 100 seats of Sophos because they claim it&#x27;s unsafe to backup and restore any data without it. The stuff that will be backed up resides on a Synology NAS available on the LAN via SMB only. We currently use Huntress and Defender on our PCs. 
 I told them OK if you think Sophos is better than our current EDR that&#x27;s fine, we can install it on the one PC that will be used to administer the MSPs backup and they can scan the NAS share. They said no we need Sophos on all the PCs or they will not agree to backup stuff via Cloudberry. I told them I don&#x27;t agree with this approach and to get approval from the people signing the checks. 
 I would like any opinions regarding the validity of their claims that 100 Sophos licenses are needed to make a Cloudberry backup of a NAS &quot;safe&quot; despite having already having Huntress and offering them 1 PC with Sophos to scan the SMB share.

                              <span>Does anyone else get phone calls from vendors trying to tell you about their latest solution? I mean, I used to be a consultant, I get it. But I now for the Federal government, The annoying part is that when I try to explain that I don&#x27;t make those decisions they either still want to talk to me or want me tell them who to contact.
 I have no idea who they would contact, and when I tell them that they insist on getting my supervisor&#x27;s name, who doesn&#x27;t make that choice either. I&#x27;m a lowly sysadmin in the mountains of Colorado, these decisions are made by someone in Washington, DC, way above my paygrade.
 My contact details are public and it&#x27;s easy to tell that I work for the Feds, anyone with half a brain should realize that they don&#x27;t do vendor and product selection in the manner.
 Excuse the rant but it&#x27;s getting ridiculous, at least the emails are easy to block.

                              <span>So I need to setup 50 PC&#x27;s at once and would very much like to cut the work required short. Problem is, for one I have no access to Microsoft Intune or similar and for another I don&#x27;t have any budget really.
 ​
 The following needs to be done on the PC&#x27;s:
 - Upgrade from W11 to W11Pro
 - Install specific non microsoft programs
 - setup Microsoft Account for specific User
 - install Fonts
 ​
 Sorry if this is a noob question. I just have zero experience in this regard and need to find a way to do it. I can probably run a lot of it in Powershell, but a solution for everything in one single way would be amazing. What do you think?

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month&#x27;s updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft&#x27;s Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft&#x27;s updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn&#x27;t work.
 Test, test, and test!

                              <span>Hi all, Do any of you have a clear DR plan for what to do if an admin account in your Azure tenant is compromised?
 As I see it, a single forgotten service account could result in all other admins passwords&#x27; changed, and losing access to everything in Azure/M365.
 In my on-premises environment, if I have a set of backup tapes for all my data sitting on a shelf, I can (theoretically) always wipe all devices to bare metal and have everything restored, including identities, in the time it takes to copy the data. Cloud is not so simple. * Azure AD itself can&#x27;t be restored, at least not with the same identities. If you lose control of a tenant, any identities are gone. And if you use Azure AD login and Intune with Bitlocker, your devices are all now wiped as well. Any configuration that depends on application configurations or managed identities needs to be rebuilt. Even UPNs wouldn&#x27;t work, since you can&#x27;t add the same domain onto a new tenant. * VMs in Azure can be backed up by any backup agent, but what about PaaS? If you&#x27;re relying on Azure Backup/ Site Recovery, you just lost that too. Are there any good options for backing up files or blobs in Azure storage accounts? What about databases? Or Azure Key Vault? Azure Automation? * If you&#x27;re using Azure services, you should be storing all your environment configuration in a code repository. But is it really all there? Have you tested a rebuild? And if you&#x27;re using a cloud repository and logging in with Azure AD SSO, I have some bad news for you..... * For Office 365 data, much of it can be backed up, but can it be restored in a new tenant? Even tenant-to-tenant migrations with access to both tenants are spotty. In a new tenant, any identities are gone, and any permissions or groups would need to be rebuilt.
 Is there any product out there that claims to be able to restore your entire Azure estate, or should I just throw my hands up and hope it doesn&#x27;t happen?

                              <span>We have a MySQL database that&#x27;s been happily accessed via T1 lines for years without issue. Now the internet provider has eliminated those lines and we are forced to rely on a Comcast cable connection (connecting via static ip).
 This works for most people, until it doesn&#x27;t. Randomly (it seems) a remote user will not be able to connect. This has nothing to do with the number of connections (we only have like 10 users at any given time). Unfortunately this is the only internet access available in our area.
 I&#x27;m going to continue troubleshooting but just wondering:
  
Do other folks use Comcast/cable provider modem/routers to access SQL dbs and do they generally work?
 Would buying a newer, better modem/router be advisable?
  
Any input appreciated.

                              <span>We use Mimecast for a spam filter and whatnot and our CEO received an email from &quot;our IT department&quot; saying that his password was about to expire and he should scan the QR code to confirm and keep using the password. The entire email almost looks like one big picture of text and a QR code so I am not sure if Mimecast could read the impersonation attempt. 
 Does anyone have any recommendations on how to block emails like this? We have all of the standard policies configured, but I think this one got through because it is an image with a URL attached to it?
 Any tips are appreciated.
 Thank you!

 Not sure why only the E3 users (which do have audio conferencing) don&#x27;t have it

 However if users have been asked to set up MFA via myaccount.microsoft.com, which control panel are you able to see this from?

 Error user sees: &quot; We tried to update your password, but couldn&#x27;t sync with your workplace because of a network problem. Try again in a few minutes. If it still doesn&#x27;t work, contact your admin and provide the detailed error information. &quot;
 The AD Connect Server is Server 2022 with AD Connect version 2.1.20.0
 On the AD Connect server, errors in the application log has many of these errors:
 Event 612: Directory Synchronization
 Failed to initialize synchronization context for domain: . It will be retried in the next password hash synchronization cycle. Details:
 System.DirectoryServices.Protocols.LdapException: The supplied credential is invalid.
 at System.DirectoryServices.Protocols.LdapConnection.BindHelper(NetworkCredential newCredential, Boolean needSetCredential)
 Event 6001: ADSync
 The management agent &quot;&quot; failed on run profile &quot;Delta Import&quot; because a connection could not be established to the server.
 So, I see it says the supplied credential is invalid, but what credential?
 I saw a blog post that said it could be related to TLS 1.2 and to add SchUseStrongCrypto key in the registry with a value of 1. I did that and rebooted, but the issue remains.
 What else can cause this?

                              <span>Hi all,
 The scenario is: You’re upgrading the domain controller to a newer version of Windows Server for some new infrastructure requirements. All workstations are Windows. No Azure AD in place.
 The problem is: Some end users that will need to be migrated to the new domain work remotely (not down the street remotely, but sometimes a few states away remotely). These users connect to resources over VPN, but the VPN authentication is tied to the domain controller that is going to be decommissioned.
 At some point during the migration the authentication of VPN is going to have to be redirected to the new domain controller. What I’m trying to nail down is what’s the best way/best sequence of steps to get all the devices on the new domain with the wrinkle of VPN being tied to the old one?
 There’s only about 15 or so people I’m dealing with, not hundreds or thousands. So even if the process is a little tedious, that’s okay. One thing I thought about is just switching the VPN (temporarily) to authenticate using some other method besides VPN before the migration starts, but I’m trying to see what all my options are.
 TLDR: upgrading/replacing domain controller, some users are offsite so their devices would be joined over VPN, but VPN auth is tied to old domain/domain that is going away. Need to figure out optimal way to do the migration.
 Any thoughts or resources would be appreciated?

                              <span>I am looking for a tool that will allow me to install on a users computer and copy data to their home directories on a schedule. 
 A little background, we do use one drive and sync data but I am looking for something that is a bit more transparent for me. I have run into issues in the past where that is setup in One Drive but it hasn&#x27;t run in months. Also, we do use a VPN connection as well so people can access the data from the servers and drives remotely. 
 The issue I have is we are a Forestry Management company and the guys are literally out in the woods on a daily basis. There is no cell services or anything while they are in the woods. The need data on their computers when they are working out there and I want to find a way to make sure the data is being backed up. 
 I had an incident where I wiped and reloaded a computer and come to find out the user has data on the root of the C drive. I have since made sure he can&#x27;t put data there but I have a feeling other users are doing the same thing because my predecessor gave users full admin access to their computers. 
 Has anyone found a software that has some type of console that will allow me to monitor when the last time data was copied or synced? Or any other suggestions?

 In Microsoft defender for Cloud there&#x27;s a recommendation: Endpoint protection should be installed on machinesThe servers do not show up in the Device inventory of Microsoft defender as well.So clearly, Endpoint protection is not installed on the servers.
 I started the on-boarding process about an hour of 7 ago, So I&#x27;m getting a bit worried.Is there a way to enforce the installation of Endpoint protection on the servers?Thanks! 
 Edit: The servers are Connected in Azure ARC, In Microsoft Defender for Cloud at the Environment settings, I have enabled Plan2

                              <span>The task scheduler in window server 2012 R2 is to run a script to copy or transfer files from local to a remote server. It needs to use a non-interactive user account to the script on the local. The non-interactive user account has been given an administrator privileges and the setting in the local security policy such as “log on as a service” and “replace a process level token”. I have created both non-interactive user account in the local and remote server. 
 How do configure so that the script can perform and run successfully?

 Have I just missed something? The only version I can find to download is the evaluation one. In our volume licence it only offers EN-US :(

                              <span>Hello :)
 we are working on Azure Virtual Desktop with Windows 10 21H2 19044.2965.
 A few weeks ago, we installed an FSLogix Update and rebooted the server. 
 Since that day users complain about Errors in the Display of Text. For Example, there appears comma in a Name, or an &quot;E&quot; becomes a &quot;D&quot;. Digits change too, good to see in Windows File Explorer when you have multiple Files named File - 1, File - 2, File -3. If i hover up and down on them the digits change to their neighbour value.
 This happens only if i RDP into the RDS-Server. If i connect via Remote Control Software, even in User Support Session i can the original text, no errors.
 This could cause devastating consequences. But i am not sure how to troubleshoot this error.
 Did you expierience a Bug like this?
 We use RDP UDP Shortpath, i disabled it temporarily but that didnt help. I think it could be a problem with some kind of Compression happening via RDP. But why after FSLogix Update..
 Should i contact Microsoft Azure Support about that? What would your next steps be?

                              <span>Hi all,
 We currently utilize a VAR for our laptop fulfilments to field users. They do everything including print a Welcome Guide and put it in the box before shipping to the users. We execute about 5,000 deployments per year. We are looking to bring that function in-house. Among the considerations for us is how to make the best use of our physical office space when prepping 100s of laptops per month. I&#x27;d like for us to be able to &quot;gang&quot; all the laptops together in a dense physical arrangement and have access to the console via a KVM (keyboard video monitor) switch. 
 Is there a KVM that has dozens of ports that you may think about for this type of arrangement? Anyone in this subreddit doing anything similar and have ideas for efficiency?
 Thanks!
 JC

                              <span>Hi all, I have a cron job in Ubuntu that runs a speed test every hour and appends the result to a CSV. Each result is a new line in the CSV. I also would like to append the time (using ‘date’ command) but can’t figure out how to make it output to the same line in the CSV. 
 I currently use date &gt;&gt; file.csv &amp;&amp; speedtest -f csv &gt;&gt; file.csv
 That outputs the date on a separate line. I want the date on the same line as the soeedtest output. Also if the soeedtest fails to run I just want the date on the line. 
 Bonus: Can I also convert bytes per sec to Mbps before outputting the results to the CSV using just the shell, without resorting to something like Python?

 They can authenticate to computer with PIN and password but they are not authenticated in Radius. 
 When i try to login with a new user on the computer I receive the error that it lost trust.
 What can cause this issue and how can i check if the PIN is expired or not, because they expire at 60 days

                              <span>Hi All
 We have a HPE DL380 Gen 10 with a 3 year base warranty. It should include 9x5 support with NBD Onsite Support and parts. We now have a defective HDD on the server. The HDD is an original part from HPE. But HPE now claims that the HDD only has a 1-year warranty and the 3-year server warranty does not cover this.
 In the past this was never an issue.
 Even the PDF for ProLiant base warranty states that additional parts are covered by the server warranty.
 A complaint to HPE did not help either.
 I think we will switch to Lenovo or Dell in the future. Working with HPE got worse and worse over the past few years for small partners like us.

 is there any way in Intune to enroll a machine certificate (SCEP) only to those machines in a known good compliance state? Maybe even revoke it if it isn&#x27;t compliant anymore?
 Also: Is it possible to filter (or build a dynamic AAD group) for only compliant devices?
 Thanks! Much appreciated :)

                              <span>I&#x27;d like to know if you know a way to connect securely a vpn (like wireguard/ipsec which is layer 3 on the osi layer) before windows starts.
 Also, there would need to be a way to avoid connecting in case the connected network is already the &quot;target&quot; network (don&#x27;t need a vpn when you&#x27;re on the right network already, you only need it if you&#x27;re remote)
 Maybe that would require to install some kind of special very tiny &quot;operating system&quot; for that very purpose, all in command line which would execute the right instructions, anyhow I haven&#x27;t been able to find yet what and how.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Hello, recently we got a new regulation that requires to perform KYC to our customers, that means we must receive and confirm our customers ID picture.
 Right now, our customer service department is storing the ID&#x27;s in the customers ticket in a help desk platform, which I totally hate and I think it should never be stored like this..
 I mean, if someone gains malicious access to this platform or one of our employees decides to &quot;steal&quot; these documents, he will do it with no issues at all.
 I was wondering, should we maybe encrypt the received documents and store it encrypted? but then, how do I even achieve that? our customer service department will still need the ability to &quot;view&quot; and confirm the ID is valid, after they confirmed it&#x27;s valid, what do I do with the file? I probably want something automated that let&#x27;s the service agent the ability to view the file and I guess I can audit this to a log file.. then I also need a DLP solution..
 I would love to hear your thoughts about that and how you think I should work with customers personal documents &amp; store them.
 Thanks

                              <span>good morning,
 trying to find fastest 1:1 nat (stateless) for linux using a &quot;middle&quot; server between two lan, tried:
 - haproxy (tcp mode), ipvs, iptable (dnat and snat black magic), tc...seems all hit a wall and not be able to reach near wire-speed nat, any suggestion?
 thank you
 (ws01)  (middle box nat)  (srv01)
 ps:
 in L2 bridge the middle linux box could reach full wirespeed of 10Gbps with 40% cpu load.

                              <span>Im am suffering a password guess attack on my Synology NAS. Someone is repeatedly trying to access the default &quot;admin&quot; account. My case is specific to Synology but I believe the same applies for any system when an attacher managed to guess a username.
 I&#x27;m not worried about security, the account is not used and I set a random 20-chars password and MFA, but I am getting security alert email every 15 minutes from the system.
 What&#x27;s the best way to react to such a scenario? Every query is coming from a different IP address, I cannot manually ban enach and every one. I also cannot remove the default admin account, or change my static IP address.

                              <span>Hi there!
 Currently I am struggling with some weird behavior regarding windows permissions. The situation is as follows:
 We have a Windows Server, which serves as a small file-server. My user is part of the domain admins, which are part of the local administrators of the windows. There are multiple directories on the server and the local admininstrator group as well as the domain admins are permissioned on each folder and file.
 Now the issue: I am unable to change or create any file in those directories.
 It only works when I take ownership of file using my user. When I give ownership to Domain Admins or Local Admins it does not work again (And yes, my user is definitly member of the domain admins).
 Does anyone know why windows apparently can not handle groups on this server? For some reason it does no recognize that my user is member of the permissioned group.

                              <span>Hello!
 Microsoft recently added Windows Laps. Which made it possible to upload the local admin password to the Azure AD device object. Which is awesome.
 I have created a desktop app which will search up the device in azure that it&#x27;s executed on and grab the password and show it to the user (if the user has access to read the property)
 I&#x27;m now also trying to make this app available for - Lets call them &quot;power users&quot; which i want to be able to get the local admin password only on the devices that they are owner of, not all devices.
 So, what I&#x27;m trying to achieve is scoping/ the API/Custom role to only grant the &quot;power user&quot; access to read the Local admin password on devices that they own/are primary user of.
 has anyone any idea on how/if i can achieve this?

 as per title I would like enable these predefined rules with a GPO
 ​
 But only for the domain profile, I tried creating a custom rule with these service names
 But it doesn&#x27;t allow me to do that and just defaults to all programs. 
 Is there any other way to do that? Do you have any hints of what to look for?
 Any helps is greatly appreciated
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 small company and current sysadmin is letting me help a bit out with smaller stuff which is a lot of fun as I&#x27;m educating myself on the side. I&#x27;m trying to figure an issue out and usually my google is on point, but I can&#x27;t for the life of me figure out where to start with the search. 
 We have multiple scan workstations on windows that need fast access to a NAS, producing thousands of folders with images on a daily basis. Current setup is old, not compliant with what we should have. Single user for all pcs that has domain admin and thus way too many rights for what that pc actually needs. But if I use a user without domain admin rights, the folder access speed to the NAS goes down dramatically to the point that a folder containing e.g. 80k subfolders doesn&#x27;t pull the list fast enough for our software to work, thus crashing the workflow. With domain admin the entire folder is listed in a second or two, without it takes minutes to list.
 I&#x27;m at a loss what exactly handles this kind of file access and thus far only found out that domain admin grants the access speed and it&#x27;s my goal to remove domain admin from that setup. Anyone kind enough to give me pointers where I could start looking?

                              <span>Hi guys!
 Got the opportunity to get 2x 3PAR 7200c and 2x M6720 Driveshelfs, each with 12x 2TB and 12x 4TB SAS drives for my homelab/mediastorage.
 To be honest: The data density to power usage ration is nothing for me with the current drives, but who knows...
 As far as i know there is no possibility to install something like TrueNAS on the Controllers, but please proof me wrong.
 Any ideas what i could do with them or should i just leave them where they are now?

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 We have some Palo Alto Firewalls and we use the Pan-DB for URL filtering. Up until last week, it was working fine but now nearly all websites are showing as not-resolved. When I do a URL check on the Palo url check, they come back low risk, and with categories. 
 ​
 I have checked and the firewalls are connected to the cloud and license is valid.
 ​
 Does anyone have some suggestions on how I can resolve this?

                              <span>I’m doing some side hustling helping out a few companies with upgrading their tech/security stack in a few key areas. AV, VPN, etc. My go-to stack is Crowdstrike for EDR, Twingate for VPN, and maybe something like Cloudflare or NextDNS for web filtering + wrapping some services to get all this set up, integrated, etc.
 Problem is — every time I present the estimated cost of everything, it’s always sticker shock.
 I get that companies are more scrutinizing of budget these days and want to save money. But if you’re running a bunch of open source stuff that your cousin built, you’re saving some hard dollars but probably costing way more in cost of someone babysitting that rickety stack, security risk of something configured wrong, etc.
 Anyway, I’m clearly doing something wrong because it’s hit or miss on getting folks to agree.
 How do you guys present your “business case” for tech upgrades like this? Do you build spreadsheets with potential cost savings, time savings, etc to show some kind of estimated ROI? If so, any templates you’ve found useful?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve read multiple similar posts on this topic in this subreddit, and you good folk provided some awesome help!
 Which is why I&#x27;m posting here as well.
 I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;ve set up the DMARC record for our new Google Workspace domain correctly.
 I followed Google&#x27;s DMARC documentation/guide precisely and added our DMARC record as follows in Cloudflare:
 https://snipboard.io/cCQTMY.jpg
 But mail-tester returns this result: https://snipboard.io/lZ8AHD.jpg
 How come the &quot;Message has a DKIM or DK signature, not necessarily valid&quot;?
 I followed what Google asked to the T. And yes I can see that the score deduction is only -0.1 but it still annoys me that the DMARC is potentially set up wrong.
 Also what does &quot;SPF: HELO does not publish an SPF Record&quot; mean? Again, I followed Google&#x27;s instructions to add SPF precisely.
 Any and all help will be greatly appreciated! Thank you!!

                              <span>So, not sure which particular rock we were hiding under, but just received notification that MS was going to block MFA by SMS, and require the app to be installed to use MFA, and current SMS users would be prompted to install the MS app as of Jul 10. 
 Several of our clients do not provide company phones, and it&#x27;s going to be a hard sell for several users and at least a couple of owners to &quot;insist&quot; they install the MS App on their personal phone for using company email.... Is anyone else running into this wall? And if so, how are you handling it gently enough to mollify the user, while still installing unwanted software on their personal device? 
 And before we go down the road of &quot;Is it really that big of a deal?!?&quot;, two things: One, it&#x27;s the principle of the thing for several users, and two: it&#x27;s not like MS has a squeaky clean reputation for how they handle personal data, so telling the user &quot;No, it won&#x27;t get any information off your phone....&quot; won&#x27;t fly very high heheh.

                              <span>I&#x27;m on a Kubernetes team where we manage 2 different distributions of K8s. We started our switch to the new platform at least 2 years ago. At that time we announced our end of support for the old one, but our users wouldn&#x27;t move their apps. They have a ton of reasons, but it mainly comes around priorities and money. Since the original announcement, they&#x27;ve had 2 chances to setup their budget for the year to include the migration but many teams have just not bothered. We&#x27;ve gotten little to no support from our leadership even though we&#x27;ve been hit with a huge, multimillion dollar cost to keep extending support and licensing. They know we&#x27;re leaving and are stuck, so they can stick us on the way out.
 We&#x27;ve alerted everyone to the fact that we are no longer doing updates to the platform and any security vulnerabilities need to now be tagged against the teams who refuse to leave rather than ours. We&#x27;ve also notified everyone that support goes away at the end of this year, even though we&#x27;re already so far behind that we aren&#x27;t supported anyway.
 What else can we do? I&#x27;m expecting our leadership to expect a Hail Mary if there is a production impacting outage even though we&#x27;re ending up so far out of support it&#x27;ll be a nightmare to fix. But we&#x27;ve got some mission critical apps running there.
 Anyway... this is sort of a rant, sort of an actual question.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I work for a small/medium size company (about 200 employees) But there are only two of us on staff in the IT Department. The company recently green lit its new ERP project. We are switching from Microsoft GP and ASC WMS to Netsuite/DataNinja. The project does not kick off until September 1st. But they have asked us to put together a IT Project plan. This is the 1st time I am ever dealing with a project like this so I am not sure how or where to start. Can you guys give us an idea on how to go about putting together a project plan? Any advice or suggestions you could give us would be great. Right now we are planning on putting together a team using one person from each department and form a rollout team. But that is as far as we have gotten.

 Is this possible in teams?
 How do you handle users skipping the proper channels and reaching out directly to you?

                              <span>I assume this is not a problem that occurs in just IT, but it seems especially bad in this field.
 I posted a sysadmin job (local in person only sadly) and none of the people who have applied presented a decent resume. One of them literally had less than 10 words per job in their experience section. Not a single one mentioned scripting or automating. (yes, scripting experience is in the listing) One said &quot;installed firewalls and AV software&quot; What firewall!? Where!? What AV on what OS!? How many!?
 I can see some potential in a couple of the applicants, so i may extend an offer for interview, but is it socially acceptable to offer resume advice in an interview? I work for a small company and am not sifting through hundreds of applicants, but if i was i would 100% gloss over every one of these so far.

 Meraki support hasn&#x27;t been much help, but I feel like I have come across posts of it having been implemented.
 Besides getting the M365 URLs/endpoints, would anyone know where to begin on the Meraki side?

I have setup samba, share and a user with password on the Ubuntu server, I can see the shared folder from both Windows clients, but I keep getting errors when trying to open the folder. The machine connecting over OpenVPN errors as if the username and password is incorrect, the machine on a different subnet says I don&#x27;t have permission to access the folder.
 What kind of settings do I need to look for when connecting like this as opposed to just on the same subnet? (the same configs work for the Windows 11 machine and a different Ubuntu Samba server both on 8 range).
 Site A (behind pfSense):
 Ubuntu 22.04 server with Samba share &amp; OpenVPN client (172.16.21.0/24) &amp; Windows 11 client (192.168.8.0/24)
 Site B (behind non-pfSense firewall with OpenVPN server setup (OpenVPN works for normal LAN access))
 OpenVPN on 172.16.250.0/24 with Windows 10 client on 192.168.5.0/24

                              <span>We&#x27;re transitioning to some new software and dropping BYOD for affected users. Order for ~65 iPads now on the docket. I&#x27;ve asked for a few quotes from a few resellers and they all came back generally the same. I expected that, its not that many devices, and negotiating regarding Apple equipment seems to be a non-question in general at this scale.
 The deployment is for only remote employees. I&#x27;m wanting to setup an MDM and ensure maintenance and processes are defined, tested, and documented within the two months I have to complete the project. I&#x27;m at the stage now where I can order some devices from a reseller I&#x27;ve been working with and make sure the auto enrollment and deployment works.
 My boss now wants me to look at a few other vendors to verify we&#x27;re getting the best possible deal. I explained my concern regarding it being more important that our setup is clean and efficient in terms of management and deployment, but was told to hold off ordering anyways. Even at scoring something like 10% off its only going to save ~$2500. The idea that I have to redo my work with another vendor to integrate with ABM and setup drop shipping, waiting for the confirmation on their side, etc. to save that amount of money makes it sound like the more expensive option.
 Want to hear the perspective of other people and see what they do/how they would handle this. It feels like splitting hairs, but maybe I&#x27;m wrong.

                              <span>Morning,
 Small company with two offices and two sites in AD, both sites have a DC running DNS. The smaller site, lets call it site 2, with one DC and just five workstations had an issue over the weekend apparently, each workstation this morning after logging in had an error that they were connected to a new network and asking if they wanted to enable network discovery. Some said yes, some said no, some just left it.
 None of them can access the server by server name \\server2 and of course they only app they use accesses the server by server name.
 Did some testing, they can ping the server IP and it resolves, they can access the shares by IP address. Same thing is happening on the DC in this site. This also happens if they try to access a server by name in site 1. Everything in site 1 is fine by the way.
 Kerberos Event ID 4 is showing up on the server and the workstations. Did the suggested SPN duplicate search but didn&#x27;t find any duplicates.
 What I did find was if I tried to ping the domain name it would return an IP address other than the server. It is actually just an IP address from the DHCP pool and not actually assigned to anything. This was happening on the server and the desktops.
 I went into DNS and removed that entry. At that point the server in site 2 started working and could access its own shares by name. Workstations could not so I rebooted them with no change. Rebooted server and it still works and so do a handful of the desktops. Some of the desktops still give the error and can&#x27;t access by name.
 They give the same event id 4 in the event viewer with the name of whatever server we try to access. Ping is working on these workstations for both domain name and server name. IP and DNS info all look good. Not sure what to try to get these other workstations going. Hoping somebody has a suggestion.

                              <span>Boss, has a few hourly people that need to block from using email on their cell outside of work hours.
 We are testing Intune, but don&#x27;t think it does this. You can turn off notifications from Outlook, but still open and use them.
 If you disable mobile and OWA, can new Outlook still work or through portal.office.com.
 And can I still set up the default mail app on phones?
 Also, when Intune was setup they used the 6 digit pin, is there anyway to go back to 4 digit pins?
 I think its better to just make a policy that states &quot;don&#x27;t check or reply to email outside work hours.&quot; And not make mobile email more painful.

                              <span>How many agents running on a machine is too many? Seems like every time we get rid of a running agent, the powers that be fall in love with a shiny new toy that must exist on every endpoint. Then they wonder why our laptops get under 2 hours of battery life on average. Anyhow, these are the agents and apps that launch on every win 10 machine in our environment:
  
Zscaler
 Rapid 7
 Crowdstrike
 Configuration manager (SCCM)
 Cisco anyconnect (Zscaler does the same Job)
 Lakeside software Systems Management Agent Systrack
 Jabra express (Headphone support software, but only half the company uses jabra headsets nowadays)
 Zoom
 Teams
 Citrix receiver (because why not)
  
I&#x27;m sure I missed one or 2 but its crazy to me. Does anyone else run these many agents or am I the crazy one for thinking its a bit much?

 I have a machine I connect to remotely (via AnyDesk/TV etc) that I need to image and redeploy on a different PC which also has windows and will be accessed remotely the same way, creating the image is easy enough since Macrium can make a shadowcopy, but to restore it I would usually have to boot some media, but since its done remotely I can&#x27;t do that, I was wondering if you guys know a way to do so without much user input (external HDD would be used to hold the image and move to the other PC)
 many thanks

                              <span>Good morning fellow Redditors. Ive seen over the years a number of these posts asking for suggestions for a small, portable, awesome monitor solution, and Ive checked out a few of them in the past, but its been a while since Ive seen anything.
 Last week I was pulled out to a location and found myself scrambling to find and then hook up a monitor. Got me thinking that its time for me to be serious about this, and look for something.
 I know in the past there is a lot of suggestions for pi-kvm-type items. But Im honestly just looking for a small monitor that does VGA/HDMI etc. When I go to some of these locations, there is a single computer sitting there, headless. 
 I carry with my a super small Logitech keyboard/mouse device, so thats taken care of, just need something awesome to have in my vehicle for these situations.
 Whats the 2023 suggestions to accomplish this task?
 Appreciate it all!

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve been searching the internet for confirmation to this question, but I cannot find a concrete answer.
 I have a ProLiant ML350 Gen10 that we are adding more hard drives to. Currently, there is only one box that has hard drives installed, and that back plane plugs directly into the RAID controller.
 To install another box of hard drives, a SAS expander card needs to be installed. If I&#x27;m understanding this documentation correctly, I will install the SAS expander card, plug it into the RAID controller, then plug the back planes of the hard drive boxes into the SAS expander.
 My million dollar question is this: will the RAID that is currently running on the server survive the migration to the SAS expander?

 I&#x27;m looking for an application to manage AiO computer in kiosk mode. I don&#x27;t need advanced options; basically, I just need to navigate through the Intranet. In theory, Windows Full Screen Kiosk Mode would be perfect, except for one thing - it doesn&#x27;t allow to exit a PDF. Unfortunately, there&#x27;s no way to bypass that. In theory, I could set up a Kiosk without Full Screen, but then I would have to block numerous websites, whereas with Full Screen, I set Intranet as the default page and people can&#x27;t exit from it. Can you recommend any user-friendly and straightforward Kiosk apps for Windows?
 To be precise, I want the computer to be constantly running in Kiosk mode, and after a few minutes of inactivity, it should clear all data and return to the homepage. I have set the company&#x27;s website as the homepage, and there is no way to navigate outside of it. You can only browse work-related news, log in to your profile to check your salary or remaining vacation days. And here lies the problem because employee data is generated in PDF format. The Kiosk with Edge easily opens the PDF, but there is no button to return to the previous page. One has to stand by the kiosk and wait for a few minutes until it clears the data and returns to the homepage.

Our radius server is expecting a regex for the FQDN so fails dot1x but passes when the computer is MABed.
 Background: These computers are part of our parent org’s domain and cannot be re-imaged. They have been added ti the appropriate AD OU, assigned correct groups, etc. These computers are also receiving all our domain GPOs and have a machine certificate from our CA. We have no issues with our own imaged computers.
 Any ideas?

 I have purchased a new Physical Server which runs windows server 2022 and I currently have my files and domain on my current physical server 2008.
 ​
 What is the best method I could perform to get my data and services on the new 2022 server?

                              <span>We have a lot of VM running at Proxmox VE
 Also, we have /26 network and VMs with IPs of this network.
 (We use OVH bare metal servers and network )
 One of those VMs used as a router/firewall for controlling the traffic of /26 network and has two IP addresses - X.X.X.123 and X.X.X.124.
 Trace to VM with IP X.X.X.111 looks like this:
 world -&gt; OVH gateway -&gt; X.X.X.123 -&gt; X.X.X.111
 Trace from VM with IP X.X.X.111 looks like this:
 X.X.X.111 -&gt; X.X.X.124 -&gt; OVH gateway -&gt; world
 So we have different interfaces for incoming and outgoing traffic.
 This was configured by adding a route:
 X.X.X.X/26 dev eth2 proto kernel scope link src X.X.X.124 metric 101
 From time to time traffic tries go throw X.X.X.123 ( eth1 ) instead of X.X.X.124 ( eth2 ) and all VMs with IP of /26 network lose acces to the internet. We can see this using tcpdump.
 This issue happened on Centos 7 and RHEL 9 now.
 After restart of Network Manager it works as expected but for a short time.
 Also, it works after moving router VM to another node.
 It starts about a year ago, but I still cannot find solution or even find a root of issue.
 So if you have any idea what it could be - please help me...

                              <span>Hello fellow sysadmins,
 I&#x27;ve been contemplating my career path in the field of infrastructure, particularly in Canada. Lately, I&#x27;ve noticed a trend where it seems like there&#x27;s a significant number of individuals interested in infrastructure roles, possibly even more than in development. I wanted to gather insights from experienced professionals to get a better understanding of the current state of the infrastructure job market in Canada.
 I would appreciate your input on the following questions:
  
Is the infrastructure job market in Canada more competitive than the development job market? Or is it the other way around?
 Are there specific regions in Canada where infrastructure opportunities are more abundant?
 How has the demand for infrastructure professionals is evolving, especially in the cloud field ?
  
Please feel free to share your observations, personal experiences, or any valuable insights regarding the infrastructure job market in Canada. I believe this discussion will not only benefit me but also others who are navigating their career paths in this domain.
 Thank you in advance for your contributions and expertise!

                              <span>Hey there, Reddit community! 
 Today, let&#x27;s talk about Optimizing airflow and cooling in server racks. Here are some practical tips:
  
Organize cables: Proper cable management improves airflow by preventing obstructions. Use cable trays and ties to keep cables tidy. 
 
Hot and cold aisle containment: Separate hot and cold airflow paths using physical barriers like curtains or panels. This enhances cooling efficiency and prevents recirculation. 
 
Rack placement: Ensure sufficient space between racks to allow for proper airflow. Avoid clustering them too closely.
 
Blanking panels: Cover empty rack spaces with blanking panels to optimize airflow and prevent recirculation of hot air. 
 
Regular maintenance: Clean or replace air filters, check fan operation, and perform regular maintenance to prevent dust accumulation and ensure proper cooling. 
 
Ventilation options: Choose racks with perforated or mesh doors for better airflow. Consider adding fans or ventilation units if necessary. 
 
Temperature monitoring: Use environmental monitoring tools to track temperature and humidity levels. This helps identify areas needing additional cooling or adjustments.
 
 Remember to share your experiences and insights in the comments. Let&#x27;s discuss how you manage airflow and cooling in your server racks!

                              <span>Hi, 
 Looking for some advice on which Azure VM spec I should be spinning up.
 We are have an employee in the Philippines (we are based in Aus) who we would like to get online through a VM. Usage will be limited to using Office (including Teams) and web.
 Is the B1 series sufficient or do we need to go to B2? As far as starting and stopping the machine could this be done by the employee to cut costs? What is the standard practice for shutting down the VM during off hours?
 Thanks

                              <span>Just Saying, I know the &#x27;normal&#x27; reason why SSL VPN is touted as &#x27;superior&#x27; - i.e its on port 443 and can &#x27;punch through&#x27; a lot of basic filtering so may work more reliable for traveling users. 
 But for orgs who run only IP-sec (i.e MS AoVPN or similar), how often is that an issue in practice. 
 Lots of SSL VPN Vulns, and while SASE is an option, its also a very expensive one vs rolling basic to good ole Ip-sec - curious what the experince is like these days and if its as bad as the vendor FUD would let you believe.

                              <span>Hi all,
 My brothers company provide a hotel for businesses in which his clients have access to the wifi and they even have a guest wifi.
 ​
 Oracle send him an email stating that there has been 6 downloads of VBox Extension under PUEL (license agreement) and that means it&#x27;s for commercial use and he has to pay 6500 USD for licenses. If we don&#x27;t they will perform audit and eventually law suit which of course the business hotel will have to pay for according to Oracle.
 ​
 My brother is concerned and don&#x27;t know what to do. They can&#x27;t identify who did it on the network as people can bring personal computers or log onto the guest wifi.
 ​
 It says on their site &quot;By downloading, you agree to the terms and conditions of the respective license.&quot;.The extension pack is under the PUEL which states that you are not allowed to use it for commercial use. Can he argue that it has not been used for commercial use as it was downloaded on personal PC&#x27;s? Do they have a way to see how it&#x27;s being used. This is in EU btw.

 But i found that when the SMTP service is not well configured or If the text I send have spammy words (like -Please, Check, Free, etc-), emails are delivered to the spam and my domain can be reported to blacklists.
 I tried Postmarkapp, Zeptomail and SMTP2GO; Right now SMTP2GO has been working really well, and emails are getting into inbox after SPF, DKIM AND DMARK and properly configured.
 Any tips, SMTP Service recommendation or do/don&#x27;t in transactional emails? Is the first time i try to make something that will send many email messages daily.

 We currently use AudioCodes media pack to connect analog devices. I am looking for advice on how to setup this paging system process in Teams Telephony. 
 On the old system calls are parked on an extension. The person who answered calls the pages the shop floor and says call 10. Shop floor person can pickup on any phone and press 10 to pickup the call. 
 Can you please advice how this would be setup in the AutoAttendant or call queue?

                              <span>This might be in the wrong section but this has stumped me. 
 We have a few poeple that are getting regular teams meeting invites through, the problem with this is that the user who set these up left two years ago and his account was disabled then removed.
 the one thing i have noticed is that these are only coming through on Teams on iOS not on the desktop our online. I seem to remember there being an issue if teams invites were set up via iPhone but I cant find this anywhere .
 ​
 Any suggestion on this one?

                              <span>Today is the last day you can buy a Windows 10 license. Though Windows 10’s time is coming to an end, Microsoft says its last-gen operating system will remain supported with security updates until October 14, 2025.
 We already knew Microsoft will no longer sell Windows 10 licenses, as it posted notices in multiple places online notifying users that it will end digital downloads of Windows 10 on January 31, 2023. Back in June 2021, the company announced it would stop supporting Windows 10 in 2025.
 Recently, the Redmond-based tech giant pulled the plug on the last remaining support for Windows 7. It also ended support for Windows 8 and 8.1. It’s easy to see Microsoft’s end goal, namely to make Windows 11 the only Microsoft operating system you can officially buy. Then checkout (Microprokey).

                              <span>I&#x27;m an ex penetration tester. After working for 10 years at various companies I found that many of them do things the old way to keep charging clients more and on a per day basis.
 A couple of years ago, I resigned and went about creating my own penetration testing and fixed the issues below.
 ​
  
Unlimited free re-tests: Current penetration testing companies charge you twice, once for the penetration test, second time (or more for re-tests). I built a model that offers unlimited free re-tests
 Scoping: I built an algorithm that automates most of the scoping process so now you can get quotes automatically for most standard projects. No need to wait days for a quote
 Reporting: I&#x27;ve created a system that generates the final reports immediately when the test is done, need to wait 10 working days for a final report..
 Crowd Testing: Some clients want several penetration testers to have a look at their targets but most pen testing companies can&#x27;t accomedate that. With my setup, I can assign as much as 10 penetration testers to each project
 24 Start: I&#x27;ve setup our penetration testers and team in a way that allows me to start a penetration test in 24 hours no matter the time of the year. This helped with clients that need urgent work
  
​
 Now I&#x27;m at a point where I want to invest and improve things for everyone even more but was wondering what issues you guys have faced during penetration testing that you would like fixed.

                              <span>Context: working for 10+ years as VMware export at a 20K+ employee comapny. Stack is 1000 hosts, multi PB storage, globally distributed HCI, 10000s of VMs.
 The company has directives to do heavy savings across the board (not just IT). On IT side there&#x27;s announced initiatives to move from VMware to a precieved cheaper solution.
 As part of a big recent re-org, multiple &quot;OKRs - Objective Key Results&quot; are at put on all teams, and many of them includes cost saving (nothing odd considering that financial situation). I&#x27;m in charge of following up some of those ORK in our team. One such objective has this exact phrasing:
 ​
 &quot;Reduce VMware team size (xx% of our total costs) as we will have less and less VM (customers will go on XX)&quot;
 ​
 Now to the main essence behind this post:
 ​
 Cost savings and new vendor migrations aside (they need to be simply accepted), I just find it outright bizarre to be asked, as a technical team, to &quot;help us rationalize yourself away&quot;. It&#x27;s clearly management topics.
 What&#x27;s your take on this? Management is taking the easy way out to not work on the reduction plans themselves in my eyes.
 Time to update Linked-in? :D :P

 Can anyone guide me how I can get an SSRS report that is generating a csv file to put it on SharePoint online instead of a shared folder.
 Or an automated way to get it from the folder to SharePoint.
 It’s doing my head in

 I have been searching but can&#x27;t find anything other than other people asking similar questions.

                              <span>Hi all, I recently started in tech and am trying to educate myself. The company I work for has the marketing slogan &quot;single pane of glass&quot; network management but after reading through reddit feeds, this is a term people are tired of hearing.
 I&#x27;m sure most companies don&#x27;t deliver on that term, making it gimicky and overused, but is there really a valid desire/need to manage through a single pane of glass? Many people I talk to are using 3-4 different vendors, so I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s not really a &quot;pain point&quot; to manage a bunch of different dashboards for different parts of the network or if people have just never experienced a true &quot;single pane of glass&quot; so they don&#x27;t know what they&#x27;re missing.
 For example, i&#x27;ll hear: we&#x27;re using palo alto for firewalls, mix of ubiquiti and meraki for wireless, and aruba and cisco for everything else...wouldn&#x27;t that be annoying to manage all separately?
 Thankful for all thoughts and lived experiences shared!

                              <span>I was wondering what you all use and have used in your campus networks for access switches, how they have been performing, what features they have, and the cost. I&#x27;ve been mainly using Cisco and I have found that I really just need a L2 switch with secure mgmt. If I could find a switch that just has basic L2 features and a few that might not be so common, that would be great. My access switches just provide connection to thin clients, VoIP phones, and printers, so I don&#x27;t see a reason to spend money on cisco products and licenses if I can just buy something more simple. But then again I don&#x27;t really know if Cisco is currently the most expensive route.
 Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m looking for in an access switch:
 -RSTP, (and MST if possible)
 -802.1q
 -LACP
 -PoE
 -SSH
 -SNMP
 Things that would be nice:
 -TACACS+ (or other encrypted mgmt aaa)
 -802.1x and or MAB support
 -HTTPS interface
 Just curious what is out there that might be cheaper. It seems like every time I put a new switch in place I just add the vlans, enable portfast for the hosts, configure username/tacacs, disable services, prune the trunk and if I&#x27;m feeling crazy double check the root bridge. I don&#x27;t need VRFs, VXLANs, or GRE. I definitely don&#x27;t need BGP or even OSPF lol 
 Let me know what you guys use for access switches.
 (I&#x27;m currently using Cisco 9200/9300s)

                              <span>I own a small ISP operating overseas for US military at a deployed location. Currently we are using DMA RADIUS manager but their solution doesn’t meet our requirements anymore. I need to be able to allow customers to buy one account, but be able to have 5 concurrent devices running at a max bandwidth of 50mbps download. Does anyone have any ideas on what RADIUS manager I can use that will allow that? We don’t have a lot of money so preferably an inexpensive solution. I won’t be the one implementing, I’m just helping our folks on the ground do some research.

                              <span>Sorry if this is not relevant to this subreddit. I want to bring up a virtual testbed, say with 2 spines and 4 leaves simulating a DC, and run BGP EVPN between them. I want to do that using either Docker or VM on my laptop (is memory going to be a concern) and then, write a script that I could run from my laptop to trace packets going across the VMs. I am assuming there has to be a bridge in Linux that should connect all these VMs together, so I basically want to &#x27;listen&#x27; on that bridge. Does anyone have suggestions on where I can start looking for ideas on how to implement this? Thanks (And vendor would preferably be Cisco NXOS as its for DC).

 I&#x27;ve got a 55,000 sq/ft warehouse that&#x27;s having a lot of dead zones in it likely due to the placement of aisles and materials. I&#x27;m pretty familiar with WiFi but know when I&#x27;m out of my depth, I don&#x27;t want to blindly throw APs at the problem. I suspect some sort of specialized/highly directional antennas will be needed to shoot down these long aisles, but I don&#x27;t have the equipment to really verify that for sure.
 I&#x27;ve got the budget and approval to hire professionals, but would prefer some personal recommendations as opposed to whoever&#x27;s paid for the best SEO to get up in the google results.

 Anyone that is further ahead than me, how is 6GHz going for you? Do you see a lot of clients picking that as their band?

 Why are these devices non existant in the enterprise world?

                              <span>Zero experience with sophos firewalls. Fortigate has a vip setup for the public up for the vdom. Npu link-0 192.168.1.1/30 vdom side is 192.168.1.2/30. The peer ip as x.x.x.28 local I&#x27;d 192.168.1.2. Where in the sophos config is the local I&#x27;d set? If I were guessing it would be under the remote local Id, select IP address and input 192.168.1.2?

                              <span>Hello Networking community!
 While both Cisco &amp; Fortinet claim to provide best SD-WAN solutions, I&#x27;m curious to know the distinct features and capabilities that set them apart.
 So, my question is: What are some specific functionalities or advantages that Cisco SD-WAN offers, which are not available in Fortinet SD-WAN? And conversely, what unique capabilities does Fortinet SD-WAN have that Cisco SD-WAN lacks?
 I appreciate any insights or experiences you can share to help me understand the key differences between these two solutions.
 Thank you !

                              <span>Hi there! Can anyone in the know advise on what underlying technologies are used in the proprietary sd-wan products for per-packet load sharing? Are they all self-written or there&#x27;s something based on open source elements? I&#x27;m trying to build something for linux on my own to load share a few bundles 4g links. Per ip/connection load sharing is straightforward. But I can&#x27;t find anything relevant for per-packet steering. Any clues, hints?

                              <span>Environment:
 I have already setup Dual WAN using TPLINK-ER605 where, WAN and WAN 1 are used.
 Load balancing is enabled where, WAN is Primary WAN and WAN1 is Backup WAN.
 Problem:
 I performed several test where I found that, when the Primary WAN was removed it took around 30-40 seconds to enable the Backup WAN. And again, when the Primary backup was inserted back it took around 1 minutes to restore the Primary link.
 Solution ?
 1.Can any body has been through the similar test before and found the same result?
 2.Is there any other process or settings that I can minimize the backup wan enabling time and primary backup link restore time?
 Thankyou in advance

In 2022, LockBit was the most deployed ransomware variant across the world and continues to be prolific in 2023. Since January 2020, affiliates using LockBit have attacked organizations of varying sizes across an array of critical infrastructure sectors, including financial services, food and agriculture, education, energy, government and emergency services, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. LockBit ransomware operation functions as a Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS) model where affiliates are recruited to conduct ransomware attacks using LockBit ransomware tools and infrastructure. Due to the large number of unconnected affiliates in the operation, LockBit ransomware attacks vary significantly in observed tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This variance in obse…</span>

                              <span>I typically lurk but I wanted to post this because I&#x27;m just so fucking pissed off.
 So for context, my company operates in three states and we have a few buildings (24/7) throughout each. We have two sysadmins in one state managing two of those states as they&#x27;re close, and then I&#x27;m the sysadmin for the other one. We each participate in a weekly on-call rotation. Typically we don&#x27;t get calls that often, and if we do have to take extra time after-hours, we can just cut that time off of Friday afternoon and sign off early. 
 We have an MSP contracted as our helpdesk, and man they fucking suck. It&#x27;s a lot to explain, but they&#x27;re just...dumb. I was woken up by a call at 3:45 AM, my phone is always on silent but it rings when I have music playing from my bluetooth speaker. I&#x27;m pissed because it …</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 This is my first post, so I&#x27;m a bit confused. I have been working in the web hosting industry for over a decade and currently hold a position as a Technical Support Staff, specializing in Linux System Administration, for a well-known company. It&#x27;s a great company with excellent management, and I have a very supportive supervisor. Overall, I love this job and excel at it.
 However, I feel that the compensation is not sufficient, and I am considering relocating to another country in the near future. I understand that my current salary may not be adequate in the new location.
 My expertise lies in web hosting support, particularly with cPanel, DirectAdmin, and related areas. I would like to broaden my skill set to pursue a higher-paying job. If you have been in a similar situation, I would appreciate hearing about the field you chose and any advice you may have regarding additional skills I could learn alongside my current role. I also have proficiency in Bash scripting and troubleshooting WordPress, and I can develop basic websites. However, beyond that, I have limited experience. I have attempted to learn a few programming languages, but given my age (currently 32), I am uncertain if programming is the right fit for me. Are there any other areas I should consider learning alongside my Linux System Administration and Technical Support role?
 I appreciate your time, opinions, and any advice you can provide.
 Thank you.

                              <span>This is an amazing resource! A month ago, I got hired as a permanent systems engineer having zero experience in the field, I used to work in a call centre (not even help desk). I work in a big company and the team has not had a new hire in the last 5 years. I am just a bit worried that it&#x27;s been a month and I still don&#x27;t have responsibilities of my own or access to everything. I have been able to shadow a few team mates and they are there for questions but I&#x27;m not really getting training as such. A quarterly meeting is coming and I should have a more solid responsibility then but it&#x27;s been a month and I haven&#x27;t been doing anything. Is this a normal experience for starters/juniors?

                              <span>Hello r/sysadmin, 
 Looking for some discussion on what the thoughts are on user local admin rights. 
 Currently we are using something called MakeMeAdmin, This allows users to elevate permissions to install and do admin activities on their machine. The biggest downside to this, is there is no way to track what is being done.
 I had the idea of using our MFA solution and CrowdStrike Identity. What my idea was, grant users admin rights to their local machine, but put a policy in place that makes them confirm an MFA prompt from DUO when elevation is requested. I still don’t think there is a way to track what is being done, but I can track who is using admin rights, and how often. 
 I’d love to discuss what everyone’s thoughts are or if there is an even better way to handle this?

 I am trying to read files from an old Micropolis 1588 SCSI disk. I have a SCSI card setup on a XP machine and it worked fine when reading a somewhat newer SCSI disk 3,5 inch. 
 Harddrive: Micropolis 1588
 SCSI Card: Tekram DC-395UW
 I have it connected with the 50pin cable, no terminators. The hdd spins up and is detected and shows up as Id 0 in Tekram screen when booting up. But nothing when in windows. What am I doing wrong? 
 Do I need to set jumpers for termination?
 Change settings for the Tekram SCSI card?
 ​
 Appreciate your help

                              <span>We&#x27;re currently trying to use FSLogix, or a similar solution for profile storage, but cannot use any virtual desktop like Azure virtual desktop. All the guides I&#x27;m reading on FSLogix talk about using Azure Virtual Desktop. Is it possible to use FSLogix and store the profiles on-premises? 
 Edit to add: Is it also viable to do this in an environment that primarily uses physical desktops, and virtual machines pretty much only used as servers?

                              <span>My boss resigned last month (thank goodness) and now I’m part of the panel to interview for new bosses. I’ve interview for technical positions in the past and once for a director position but it was just myself and the candidates, not 5 other people ( I hate interview panels..) When I’ve interviewed in the past, I tried to keep it more of a conversation, I feel like this isn’t possible in a panel type interview.
 We’re given a list of a dozen questions that we have to ask (split between us,) no idea what they are and then we do a round table of questions to ask our own questions - I have no idea what everyone else is going to ask - I recommended we set up a pre meeting to discuss but it wasn’t well received ( the interview is already scheduled for 4 hours…) 
 So, I’m trying to create a list of engaging questions I can ask.
 If you were in my shoes, what would you ask?

                              <span>As a rule, how do you install software when both EXE and MSI options are available? Do u have a preference or standardize on one over the other? Or is it decided on a case by case basis? Or does it really matter? I didn&#x27;t think it did for many years but have recently run across a couple cases where we inconsistently used a mix of EXE and MSI installers for products. Now we are trying to upgrade those products using one consistent method but the MSI upgrade won&#x27;t update software installed by EXE, and vice versa. It&#x27;s making quite a mess as we sometimes end up with two installs each.

 the email servers of the receivers some of which may decide that my email server isn&#x27;t legit, or semi-legit, because of absense of A record on it

                              <span>We have a problem with one of our Nodes that needs 3 new disks.
 We have a 3 Node Cluster, first two installed in 2020, with the third installed in February. The disks in the third node are Samsung Evo 870s, with the disks in the other two Samsung Evo 860s.
 Two weeks ago, we had three disks in the third Node fail and we&#x27;re unable to get 870s as a replacement as these are no longer being made. As a result, we&#x27;ve sourced 4 brand new enterprise grade Samsung SSDs.
 We&#x27;ve managed to retire the first drive, however, it gets stuck when trying to remove it from the storage pool. We think this is because it&#x27;s still trying to do a Volume repair due to the dodgy disks. So it gets to 89% then goes back to the beginning and is in an endless loop trying to remove the disk from the storage pool.
 We&#x27;ve moved all VMs off the third node, but we&#x27;re unable to pause the Node due to the problem with the disks...
 What is the best way forward, just pull the disks out and replace them or forcibly evict the Node from the Cluster?
 We don&#x27;t want any corruption or problems though.
 Any advice greatly appreciated.

I have never really been happy with the Schitt, so I was curious if any one here had any reccomendations for a new DAC. I do not do anything too crazy, mainly just listening to music when I get woken up at 2 am and am in troubleshooting mode, or catching up on documentation at home. I thought I would ask here instead of one of the Audio sub-reddits, as I am looking for something sensible, not something insane

                              <span>So this is making me scratch my head. I&#x27;ve got a lovely IKEV2/IPSEC tunnel setup between an AWS environment, and onprem. Both sides using Strongswan as the endpoints. Routing rules are applied in the Strongswan instances via iptables.
 The onprem side is behind NAT, so the required ports are forwarded. Everything works great, but what I cannot understand is, how do my other network devices know how to find the tunnel? Presumably packets destined for AWS must be directed to the Strongswan VM which in turn knows the route, but by what mechanism are packets arriving at the Strongswan VM in the first place?

 Debian 10
 Client:
 Windows 11
 I use my file server as a no-authentication access terminal in my computer room. I&#x27;m not worried about someone one coming in, joining the network, and downloading my stuff. If anything, being able to easily do that is great since the few times people do want to do it, those people have no idea what a hard disk is, more or less what Samba is.
 I&#x27;ve been using Samba for years now, but I heard that NFS has less overhead and wanted to try it out. It was easier to set up and get running. It took me longer to get Windows set up to read the share then to make the share.
 I did the anonyms registry for User and Group since I&#x27;m not overly concerned about security.
 Now the issue (in windows) is that if I leave a window (or a panel in Double Commander) pointing anywhere in the share and then come back after a minute or two, it hangs for about 8 seconds before resuming.
 Is this normal for NFS shares, or did I misconfigure something?
 The feedback from windows mount;

                              <span>Hello,
 We have a customer that we are taking care of his BGP peering needs by using our Cisco ASR router running IOS-XR. In order to do so we configured a VRF instance and local-as within the VRF&#x27;s BGP configuration (it&#x27;s a special case and normally we do not do this).
 Unfortunately, using this setup our own AS number gets involved in the AS-Path, ie instead of having an AS-Path of 12345 12345 12345 (with prepending), we have an AS-Path which looks like 12345 56789 12345 12345 12345 (with 12345 being the customer&#x27;s AS and ours being 56789, of course these are not the real AS numbers). The BGP peers do not like this, so they reject it in their BGP filters.
 Is there any way to workaround the above issue with IOS-XR? I &#x27;ve spent a couple of days researching this, but could not come up with any solution. Thanks for your time.
 Best regards,
 G

                              <span>in our network we have Cisco switch 2960 G all of our clients connect to this switch. this switch connected to our HP DL380, on this HP server someone installed ESXi and on this ESXi we have more than 50 VMs. some VMs are Linux and some of them are windows. our Linux servers and windows servers use 192.168.90.0/24 , our clients use 192.168.91.0/24 , our switch connected to Mikrotik router model of this Mikrotik router us RB1100Hx4 , our internet go to this mikrotik router and from mikrotik go to our cisco switch and all of clients can access to internet.
 from this week after power outage all servers and router and switch restarted, after restart some of Linux servers can not ping and we can not access to these servers. we can not ssh or ping these servers.
 ​
 from our HP servers three cables come out and these three cables connect to port 33 and 35 and 36 of the switch.
 today we can not to ESXi web interface and we can not ping ESXi IP of web interface .
 After test many things. I unplug of cable from 33 and everything go fine and after that we have access to ESXi web interface and ping and SSH all Linux servers comeback .
 How I can find the problem and try to solve this.
 I have access to Cisco switch and Mikrotk router and can put configs of these devices here.

                              <span>So, they&#x27;ve got above-ground fiber between my building and main building at work where I started recently. 
 They said after a storm the fiber stopped working so they are using ubiquity wifi external antennas instead to connect the two buildings.
 After I replaced a couple of smaller unmanaged switch in my building with a new larger managed switch I poked around and found the fiber to copper converter wasn&#x27;t getting any power. Found the plug the power brick for the converter was dead.. Plugged it into another plug and got power.. Yay
 So now I get the the copper cat 5 plugged into my laptop and get the hoped for activity lights blinking and the gigabit connection light as well.. But just get unidentified network on laptop
 I Plug it into the switch instead
 The switch shows the port change to UP state and I again have activity and Gb connection
 Port shows its up but no ip or any connection info/network.
 Still have to investigate the other side the fiber connects to the switch in other building But, it gets a connection and there is all lights blinking as if there is traffic flow 
 Not sure where to take this beyond checking other end connections. 
 Even if signal sucked due to messed up fiber, if it detects a gb connection and shows traffic, I should have at least spotty network connection no? 
 Any suggestions welcome! 
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hey folks. I&#x27;m one of the authors for Mastering OpenVPN, the author of Troubleshooting OpenVPN, and the maintainer of EasyRSA. In light of Apollo and other 3rd party apps going dark on the 30th, I figured I&#x27;d &quot;turn in my notice&quot; on Reddit and do the normal sysadmin data dump/brown bag before I&#x27;m gone. I&#x27;ve really enjoyed this group and hope things get sorted in the long run.
 I think others here in this sub should do similar, and share their niche/experience.No idea where the next platform will be, but it was 4chan, /., Digg, then here. I&#x27;m not in other social media, so if any of you have suggestions, please share.

                              <span>We have a remote site with a VPN router back to DC, standard stuff.
 Site goes down completely, so no visibility inside at all. Spent some time coaching the service desk to get some trace routes and pings from the users, photos of router status LEDs and checking with the ISP for known service outages in the area.
 Too much time goes on we decide to just get a contractor / tech hand out there to console me in to the router via a remote connection to their laptop.
 There are four built in switch ports on the router and two of these are configured, one for LAN and one for WAN. I&#x27;m consoled in now, router is not dead, good. But WAN interface is down. I can see LAN is up then I notice another port that is up and is not configured.
 Check logs, it came up about the same time the WAN went down.. I ask the tech to move what ever is in that port to the WAN and.. boom, sites back up.. someone had literally moved the WAN cable into another port!! WHY?
 I tell the tech to ask them who has been in here (comms room) today, who was in here at the time network went down, why are they moving cables.
 The site managers response was &quot;well the wifi was running slow and that happens sometimes and what we do is we just move this cable from one port to another it comes good again&quot;.
 WHAT
 No, seriously, in a technical sense it is completely impossible. I even reviewed config backups for a sanity check. There has only ever been one WAN port. What the heck man. 
 ​
 TLDR site manager troubleshooting site wifi decided to move the WAN connection on their router to another port.

                              <span>The company I work for hired two co owners of our MSP to run our IT department. Officially we have a new outsourced chief information officer. He&#x27;s planning to spend a bit of dough getting our systems aligned with the systems they setup for other companies. They want to host our websites, software, and applications instead of using google and aws as we&#x27;ve been doing. I guess they want users to be logging into hosted computers as well. I&#x27;m not thrilled with the mgmt style and I think they&#x27;re just trying to load their pockets but... I&#x27;m interested to see how they migrate and implement the different technology. It&#x27;s really the only reason I&#x27;m still at this job. 
 Does this seem like an issue, or is this just how business works?

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been trying this problem and nothing fixed
 I&#x27;ve been making notes of these Windows updates errors and they all have something in common, I can&#x27;t seem to fix them and get the systems back into a state of functioning updates. No matter what I&#x27;ve tried they persist and prevent some or all of the updates from installing.
 there are the errors that change like 0x80070424, 0x800703ee etc...
 I have tried running all malware antivirus scans and there is no foul play to my knowledge.
 Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve tried:
  
Running dism to repair it (even with a extracted new windows image file)
 Running sfc /scannow
 installing window from flash drive on another pc and hard reset and everything
 Cleaning the C: drive and temp folder
 Removing old updates and trying to re-run updates
 Manually downloading window
 3rd party programs like reset windows update tool and sfcfix
 Updating/uninstalling/reinstalling Microsoft&#x27;s redistributables and runtimes
 i have reset pc for like 6 times
 Ive tried running the troubleshooter, and running a windows update repair
  
I&#x27;m fresh out of ideas and I&#x27;ve been researching these issues for 3 days
 I wish there was some way to fix and is there any fix to this problem and thank you in advance please

                              <span>Scenario:
 One Windows 11 PC (&quot;Win11&quot;) and one Windows 10 PC (&quot;Win10&quot;) on a LAN. Accounts under the same (admin) name (&quot;Userguy&quot;) on both devices. RDP is properly configured on both devices, and a login preset (Username: &quot;Win10\Userguy&quot;, password: &quot;3xample&quot;) has been set up on Win11 to login on Win10. These credentials work when entered manually.
 Issue:
 When trying to RDP from Win11 into Win10 from a shortcut or selecting Win10 from the dropdown in the RDP interface, the login always fails and a window opens to enter login details. In the window the default user name reads &quot;Win11\Userguy&quot; instead of &quot;Win10\Userguy&quot;, which then has to be entered manually again, and the right password. Which work fine. But even when saving these credentials, the next time the issue happens again.
 Edit:
 After doing a manual save of the preset, it now seems to properly save the username (&quot;Win10\Userguy&quot;) but the login still fails and I am dumped in the Windows Security dialogue (&quot;Your credentials did not work&quot;) which asks me to enter the correct credentials. Now the default username reads &quot;Win10\Userguy&quot; but if I just enter the password I am returned to the Windows Security dialogue (&quot;Your credentials did not work&quot;), and only after using &quot;More choices&quot; and entering the credentials again (username and password) does the login succeed.

                              <span>Bit of a weird one. We&#x27;ve setup a new Dell PowerEdge server to replace an old Small Business Server. It&#x27;s a decent spec machine with 64gb memory and 4 x SAS SSD (with the higher end RAID card) running Windows Server 2022 Std.
 The server feels really solid and quick when its running and setting it up we&#x27;ve had no issue. However at some unknown point it&#x27;s started taking a crazy long time to boot, like 40 - 45 mins. It just sits on the spinning circles forever although you can access file shares on it during this time and some other functionality is working.
 I&#x27;ve checked the logs and a large number of the services seem to be timing out while starting. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a pattern though and they are all kinds of different services covering different things. When the server finally does boot, the following services are stopped:
 Distributed Transactions Coordinator
 Diagnostics Policy
 Network Access Policy 
 But if you click to start them, they seem to startup without issue and once it finally loads it all runs without issue and seems 100% fine.
 The server has the Active Directory Domain Services, DNS, DHCP, File/Print and NAPS roles.
 It&#x27;s an absolute nightmare to debug because I make a change then have to spend 45 mins waiting to see if it works. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be any errors other than the services are just timing out with the error &quot;A timeout was reached while waiting for .
 Anyone seen this before?

                              <span>Does anyone have suggestions for an outlook add-in that would help manage all the daily alerts that come in? I’m thinking something that could summarize alerts from a system, but if the number, or type of alert changes from the “normal” then we get a high importance email, otherwise something that would summarize the nightly alerts. I don’t want to set up rules necessarily, because I don’t want them all to go, I just want fewer I guess. Or a summary of the ones we do get.

                              <span>I&#x27;m used to macOS where screenshotting is built in, shows a region window upon hotkey combination, and instantly saves an unaltered png to your desktop. thats literally all I want. no other frills. 
 I&#x27;ve used both shareX and greenshot- sharex felt way too clunky and I hate that the region selector for greenshot is a transparent green- completely unnecessary imo. 
 Is there a better alternative? I know I could use ctrl+win+s, but I hate that I don&#x27;t have a way to auto redirect the output to my desktop as a png, instead it goes to some random-ass folder that I have to dig for. 
 Thanks &lt;3

                              <span>2 years ago converted all offices from Cisco to fortinet for firewall, switches and wireless. Love having everything under one interface for management. Problem is the wireless and FortiAPs. Users randomly complaining about wireless drops, slow speed, poor handoff between APs. 
 Have worked with fortinet tac and have upgraded firmware, adjusted settings. Problem is each tech has different opinions on what settings to use. No combination of firmware/settings seems to be correct. A change may correct one issue but then either introduce a new issue or make a pre existing issue worse. 
 I am getting to the point where I want to throw in the towel on fortinet wireless and swap to another product line. 
 I know I am going to get lots of different answers. Which wireless vendor is best for simple Wi-Fi network deployments? Trying to get something where I can set it and forget it and stop getting complaints from users on a weekly basis.

                              <span>Ohai, I figured all of you are in the situation of &quot;being the computer guy&quot; in your families, and would know a good tool.
 I hadn&#x27;t touched gotomeeting since mid 2010&#x27;s, and what it is now is too overwhelming for the guy I&#x27;m trying to help. Back in the day, it was just &quot;Open thing, here&#x27;s the meeting code, click ok till we&#x27;re in a meeting, hit share screen, hit give control.&quot; Now it&#x27;s prompting for accounts, has the whole zoom presenter-isms, attendee popups, and overall so much noise that I couldn&#x27;t guide him into actually getting his screen successfully shared.
 So like, before I have to get in the car and drive 3 hours to go setup a RealVNC server on this guys box, do you have any better tools to recommend? I&#x27;m not on his network/not vpn, his machine is Win11 Home (no inbound RDP). Absolute minimum popups/clicks to get into the meeting is like my only concern, they panic whenever anything pops up, at all &#x3D;p

 Unsure if I want to allow it or push back and say it&#x27;s completely unsecure. Anybody here ever come across a similar issue and want to chime in with some advice? Would massively appreciate some input.

                              <span>We have an OptiPlex 5000 PC used for a classroom interactive TV on the network. However, when anything is printed, such as Word documents, PDFs, etc., it only prints in red and not full colour. The printer is not the issue, as another device prints perfectly. I have checked the settings, and they all appear to be the same as the other devices. Although, in the settings, one button for colour options is greyed out (sorry, I don&#x27;t have a screen grab). Can anyone suggest a simple solution besides reimaging the PC?

The complaints also alleged that Epik&#x27;s customer support is not providing timely or substantive responses to customers inquiries. All complaints received by ICANN org have been, or are in the process of, being addressed. These include the complaints referenced in the formal breach notice ICANN org issued to this registrar on 1 June 2023.

                              <span>Reddit API costs are being put into effect to stop/slow AI model training.
 But before anyone stopped to consider asking for an API exception for bots and apps, were just protesting by having subreddits going dark temporarily/permanently on the basis that we wont have some third party app and accessibility features. which is not effective without negotiating for special app/bot exception for the API alongside the protests.
 Unless all these protests are secretly to keep API free to allow for free LLM training. Who is really behind the mass protests as AI has not been mentioned at all in the big subreddits protests/going-dark posts.
 99% of people don&#x27;t realize the API changes are meant to disallow big AI conglomerates to easily scrap reddit to train AI on our data for profit
 I dont want my data to be used to train a LLM, only to be charged to use this LLM when it comes out.

                              <span>Just wanted to reach out to the UK based sysadmins on here who may have domain/DNS records hosted with DomainCheck.co.uk. The company appears to have gone bust, likely some time in March. The records remain available but there is no way to log in and update/change anything nor do they respond on email/phone. I&#x27;ve had to fight my way around getting the domains transferred to other hosts this week so wanted to drop a note out as a heads up for others who may be in the same boat but not realise it yet.
 They are a reseller of enom.com for .com domains and they would help for those. For .co.uk Nominet will assist with getting you access to your records.
 If you are impacted, good luck and may you get records migrated with minimal fuss.

                              <span>Hey Guys, I am trying to create a search in CA which looks at whenever users from certain OU are added to groups within certain OU.
 Now I can easily get all the users added to certain OU but I am struggling to filter out the users within WHAT tab. Is there a way to do that filtering using restriction? I know I can filter out once the report is created but I was wondering if it can be done within the search properties?

                              <span>my company uses papercut mf cloud print solution aka “find me” and we add printers to computers by searching directory for “find me azure”. it allows staff to print from any xerox in the building using their badge - print jobs are stored centrally. they badge in to release it. 
 were currently having an issue where our vdi-on-thin-client users (windows 11) keep losing their printers when the vdi restarts/shuts down periodically (for whatever reason im not yet sure). we havent figured out how to make printers and the general state (bookmark, preferences) persistent via group policy and/or vmware horizon config. 
 However, this issue is not happening for all users but consistently occurring for the same users 
 Also it seems printers are only lost during local restart. when admin remotely restarts users’ vdi, the printers are not lost (a theory based on a couple examples)

                              <span>As a &quot;non&quot; who casually uses vanilla Reddit to keep up with IT memes and support, I find it relatively annoying that subreddits like r/iiiiiiittttttttt are saying they&#x27;re going dark indefinitely.
 Without proposing alternatives and the subreddit mod(s) just saying &quot;kthxbye&quot; is really a slap in the face of the us the users, not Reddit, of these niche communities.

                              <span>Just checking this is the best way to set this up from a best practise method and how most people do it?
 I&#x27;ve got a share (Data_Shares) with around 25 sub folders inside it and currently everyone has access to all sub folders. How it works is Domain Users grouo has access at Data Shares top level and all sub folders have inherited permissions. 
 But now i want to make 5 secure folders. Do i just disable inhertiance on these 5 sub folders, remove DomainUsers group and add security group (with correct users in).
 I have access based enumeration on Data_Shares so it&#x27;s going to hide the folders for anyone not in. Just want to check that&#x27;s the way to go disable inhertiance on the selected sub folders?

 I know you can use a SCIM enabled HR system to provision users into AAD, but can you provision users into AD using SCIM, which then uses AD Connect to sync up to AAD

 Tiny resume:
 Reedit is changing its API price (up to 20 million $ per year) to the third party apps that offers accessibility to ddisabled people, no ads, no porn, and also it offers better tools for subreddit moderation, things that the official reddit app doesn&#x27;t.
 Basically the blackout consist in going &quot;dark&quot; 2 days, from 12th to 14th. (or indefentely, some communities like r/ProgrammerHumor prefers to go dark indefentely)
 I hope this doesn&#x27;t break any rule, if so mods please feel free to delete my post but at lease consider what people is gonna vote. 
 Since we are sysadmins, i think we could join this blackout, we know how much painful can be this type of things irl, so i think we could join them.

                              <span>We had some pen testing done recently and whilst they didn&#x27;t manage to pivot anywhere they did flag that we should block/disable NetBIOS, mDNS and LLMNR.
 Technically these all look reasonably simple to block.
 Our environment is pretty diverse.
 If you&#x27;ve disabled these did anything stop working and if so what was it please?

                              <span>Hello,
 I am facing a terrible delay when connecting from Windows 10 to Ubuntu 20.04 via Windows Remotedesktopconnection. My download speed is 60-80 Mbps and upload 20-30 Mbps. Ping to the remote machine says 25ms. I&#x27;ve tried to do some configurations on Remotedesktopconnection window such as colour depth, bitmap caching etc but no success. Writing code has a delay of 0-0.5 seconds and opening folders with &gt;100 images takes 1-3 seconds. Opening or just dragging a single image takes 1-3 seconds as well. I do not own the remote machine so changing configurations over there might be limited. Is this sort of delay a common issue when trying to connect a windows 10 with a ubuntu 20.04 machine? Should I consider switching to windows as well for my remote system?
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hello. Seeking opinions. I&#x27;ll keep out some of the details to keep it short. I need to get a redundant/backup internet carrier at a very important site for our small/med enterprise. It is a warehouse location. The wrinkle is that we are leaving this site in approximately one year, but up until that time it is crucial that if one ISP dies another is available. Our current provider is actually the cable company, who has an enterprise fiber division. The only other provider in the building is the legacy RBOC who has fiber.
 I have been getting quotes through a telco broker who works with multiple different companies that use the RBOC as the last mile/loop, but they either refuse to quote 1 year or the pricing is very high (over $1000) even for speeds like 50 or 100Mb. I have looked at satellite internet services which seem too slow. I have looked at 5G broadband, but my hesitation is that they seem to offer no guarantee as to speed or performance. The fine print literally says there is no minimum speed. I need at least 50Mb up and down to run the business in the event of a failover. Another option is business (not enterprise) class cable modem, from the same provider as my current service. I inquired about redudnancy/separation between the two services, they did not get too deep into detail but admitted that they did potentially share some of the same equipment.
 So what would you do?
 A) Get the wireless broadband service, and hope it doesn&#x27;t suck horribly when needed
 B) Get the cable modem and hope the services don&#x27;t ever go down at the same time
 C) Bite the bullet and try to convince ownership that we should pay the $1000 per month for the backup service, which is more than we pay for our primary service. The internet in this location has not gone down for at least 5 years, but if it did and we didn&#x27;t have a working backup it would definitely cost the company more than $12,000 if it was down for a day.
 Thanks

 The small company I work for has hired so many people the server rack is being evicted from the office it lives in. The plan is to build a room inside an attached shed which will house the servers, some switches, my dev machines (retired desktops on shelves), AC, and possibly become the handoff point when fibre arrives. The company has 15 staff on site, and 7mb uploads mean most things are hosted locally.
 The word &quot;shed&quot; probably makes people nervous, but it&#x27;s 7mx7mx5m tall on concrete and is used for storing supplies with CCTV inside and out, and security alarms. 
 The build plan for the server room is full insulated walls, drywall interior, and properly sealed doors (with locked doors that they don&#x27;t get keys to, outside of an emergency). Internal dimensio…</span>

 Just moved to a new place and looking for job opportunities. I have several years of experience and certifications in IT Networks. My choice initially was to transition to cybersecurity (a SOC position maybe), but that is not leading to anything at the moment. A QA position opened up for me, would this be a grab or pass?
 Edit: to add, it is a QA for a networking device

 We have some vSAN clusters running LACP into a single Arista 7050s switch.
 Are we able to MLAG a couple of the 7050s switches and run an LACP PO for each vSAN node to each switch?
 TIA!

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;ve been searching around this section for recommendations on storage switches to be used for iSCSI SAN traffic.
 My environment is fairly easy with gigabit ethernet HP 2530 switches for SAN to Hypervisor connectivity.
 Usually I have 3 VMware hosts connected to two HP 2530 switches and going to compellent or powervault SANs.
 Our environment is mostly HP/Aruba and it would be easier for me to work with.
 I&#x27;d like to have 1/10GbE capabilities and 24 ports per switch should suffice.
 I&#x27;ve inherited this network so how it currently is configured with the existing 2530s was not my design.
 I do recall when working with VMWare support, we realized that the buffer on the 2530 was too low and was potentially impacting some performance.
 I guess I&#x27;m am not entirely sure what I should be looking for. As I have the option to standardize our sites, I think using Aruba will still be a good option, but I&#x27;m all ears.
 Ethernet or SFP should be fine, I would be looking at deploying 1gb while we wait for hardware for 10gbe connectivity.
 Any suggestions on what I should look into? I believe that buffers are critical for SAN switches but aside from that, I&#x27;m not sure.
 Thank you

                              <span>Hope you guys can help. 
 I&#x27;m going to struggle to explain this, but ill do my best.
 We have the below set up 
 Cisco Router -&gt; Fortinet -&gt; 2 x Aruba -&gt; 2 x legacy netgear switches 
 I&#x27;m aware that the Fortinet is set up as DHCP server which give out a range 10.157.....
 but when I connect to the Netgear switches they hand out 192.168.000 
 I think the netgears switches are running a DHCP service on them which is handing the 192 range out, but my question is 
 Why are the Arbuas not pulling an IP range from the netgears and or vice versa?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been trying to find a solution to a weird issue I&#x27;ve been having for a few days now, and this is my last hope. I&#x27;ve got a pair of SRX340 firewalls which I acquired in order to replace a pair of dell R330 boxes running PFSense. The goal here is to use them just for an IPsec tunnel into our GCP environment.
 As a precursor, the current PFSense boxes are in operation with one GCP tunnel each, sharing a GCP VPN gateway. When I run an iperf test over them, I can get up to 600mbps per tunnel. Plenty for what I need.
 However, when running a simple configuration in a test environment using the Google community guide for SRX devices, I&#x27;m only getting ~230mbps of possible bandwidth over the firewall. To be clear on this example, it&#x27;s one SRX340 with one tunnel to GCP, dynamic routing, a gigabit WAN connection with a static IP on ge-0/0/0, and I have a laptop plugged into ge-0/0/1 on the device to run iperf3 over. Without the SRX340 in the mix, I can get 930mbps iperf3 over the internet to my test VM in GCP.
 My issue is with the 230mbps number. The SRX340 is rated for up to 733mbps of IPsec bandwidth, and I&#x27;m running the configuration given as an example in the Google guide. I just can&#x27;t seem to break that speed barrier. Am I missing something or is this what I&#x27;m to expect out of an SRX340?

                              <span>I’m newish to the field and this is my first sysadmin job. I work at a 24x7 facility so we have an on call rotation. There’s only 3 of us on the team so we are on call frequently. On top of this they ride our ass about phone calls. If you miss a phone call you’re getting chewed out. We also have maintenance monthly on Sundays which means once a month I’m giving up my Sunday. 
 I really like what I do but these after hours calls and the frequent on call is wearing me out. Is this a normal aspect of the job that I have to get used to or is this unique to where I work. Thank you!

 One for my colleagues did something without checking with the PM. So a couple of days later, we asked who did it and my colleague A said “B said to do it in a daily scrum. My response was “sorry I did not say that”. Everyone knew that I did not do it but he kept saying that I done it.
 My director and other colleagues stepped in and said “B did not say that” which I was glad. I noticed this guy A never admit his mistakes and this is not the first time he screwed things up and blame others.
 Has anyone worked with someone like that or similar?

                              <span>Over the last several months, my Hotmail account has been bombarded by a stream, 50+ per day, of scammer emails, many of which had direct links to web sites that had backdoor javascript exploits that were being used to infect visitors with banking password capturing malware. Even the unsubscribe link is using these backdoors and malware. (I just now got one &quot;RE: Ready to Glow&quot; from the email &quot;DarkSpots&quot;) I have dutifully reported them nearly ever time they&#x27;ve come in, but MS has done nothing to slow the stream of these emails. It has been at least 4 months now since it started. 
 I investigated the source of these messages myself, looking up the domains and IP addresses, and found that the links are almost entirely hosted under AWS, through their CloudFront services. The domains themselves…</span>

 I am wanting to implement a WIKI for my team. Currently we use SharePoint and it&#x27;s terrible. I don&#x27;t know if that means I&#x27;m terrible at it, and should invest more time in SharePoint. Or is there a better alternative? 
 What do you use? Would you recommend it? Happy to spend a few thousand for the right solution.

                              <span>I have a gen 2 cloud key, an 8 port enterprise switch, and an access point at home (all ubiquiti).
 I was trying to get rid of the spectrum router, and use the 8 port enterprise switch, but was not getting an internet connection through my enterprise switch. 
 Has anyone gotten a similar set up to work? I don&#x27;t have a business account, so the public IP should be dynamic.
 Edit (I tried disconnecting the spectrum router entirely, and just tried using the ubiquiti switch I.e my modems Ethernet cable was going directly into ubiquiti layer 3 switch. Spectrum router was out of the picture)

                              <span>I everyone,
 I&#x27;m currently a student in admin/sys and I&#x27;m working on a projet in my internship.
 This projet is about the auth reinforcement in general.
 Currently we&#x27;re using Kerberos and the CIO wants to put a RADIUS server instead (+ 802.1X.)
 I&#x27;ve a given solution but for my thesis and as a beginner I&#x27;m trying to figure it out why would we replace kerberos by a RADIUS.
 And more I search and more I&#x27;m convince that Kerberos is better ??
 (info we are 250 people)
 For now I found that :
 Kerberos in highly secure, provide two factor auth, SSO
 And for RADIUS honeslty I mainly found that it&#x27;s &quot;easier&quot; to manage, no really technical advantage.
 I&#x27;m really trying to have an critical POV about this to justify the need to replace kerberos, and first I tried to answer the question &quot;Why would I build up a central server with all credentials ?&quot;
 Because it&#x27;s what mainly I understood about RADIUS and I thought I&#x27;ll found instead &quot;this is an hyper secure proven solution&quot; and not just some &quot;easier to manage&quot; stuff.
 And I&#x27;m bewildered... 
 Maybe I&#x27;m wrong or not considering the real need ?
 Thx

                              <span>I know this EXO Admin Center has had a new form for quite some time now, I avoided using it. I do like the interface but some of the functions are a step backwards imo.
 As an example, if I were to go give permissions to a shared mailbox, when I go to delegation and add, it completes and I have to close the window out, if I also need to apply send as permission, I have to go back into the mailbox to do so where in the &quot;classic&quot; admin center, everything can be done in the popup window without closing anything. This function is no longer available in the classic admin center.
 I know it&#x27;s a minor annoyance and yes, I do use powershell more often than not to accomplish some of these tasks, I know Microsoft is gonna Microsoft but some of the changes are just so annoying. I think things like message trace are better here but overall, I don&#x27;t know what they were thinking with some of the changes.

                              <span>So one of our agencies is getting a software from the company Axon. They will fill out a report and it will go to the Axon website. From there, Axon generates an XML and JSON file and wants to place those files on our network for other users to access so they can open the XML file and enter in data from it.
 Our Network team said this was impossible as Axon does not have anything that would connect it to our provate network. Axon says as long as a PC has internet access they could drop the files on a SFTP server here if we give them a user account for it. Our network team still said it was impossible even doing that because our SFTP server is a linux server.
 Who is correct here?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve got users using various versions of outlook (some as old as 2010...) but they have periodically asked me if there&#x27;s some alternative to rebooting their computer to address extreme sluggishness in outlook (e.g., just clicking on a new message has a big delay).
 These computers have tons of available memory and and restarting the app doesn&#x27;t help so I suspect there&#x27;s some windows service I need to restart which outlook if relying on that is causing the issue.
 ​
 Do you know what service it is?
 I&#x27;d prefer not to tell people to reboot their whole computer to address this issue
 Thanks,
 IB

                              <span>My employer runs a DHCP pool from our core switch. We also use MDT to image PCs before deployment to new users. We&#x27;ve recently spun up a new MDT server and want to update the DHCP pool&#x27;s settings to redirect PxE requests to the new server. I&#x27;ve updated the ip helper-address settings for the VLANs interfaces and the &#x27;option 66&#x27; setting to point to the new server, but PxE boot requests are still being directed to the old server&#x27;s address. Does something need to be restarted or reloaded in order for the settings to take effect?

                              <span>Hello All,
 ​
 In the era of WFH and remote connections, I wanted to put this idea out to the community.
 ​
 What do you think of an auto-detecting VPN client? (or an auto-detect feature built into the vpn client)
 ​
 What I was thinking was:
  
The VPN client when connected would work as its supposed to with routing policies and things of that nature
 When the VPN client is not connected it would monitor traffic based on policies and rules and when it detects that the system is attempting to connect to a resource on the destination network that is only available through VPN it would prompt to connect
 The idea is that people would be able to stay off the VPN and only initiate a connection when its required.
 Further it would reduce IT helpdesk tickets because rather than logging an IT ticket when they can&#x27;t access a resource, only to find they haven&#x27;t connected to VPN, the client application would pop up with a notice &quot;looks like you&#x27;re trying to connect to your workplace, would you like to connect?&quot;
 The user could click yes or no and if they click yes then it would initiate the connection sequence (prompt for password, mfa, etc.)
  
​
 what do you guys think? let me know in the comments

                              <span>For those of you who had admined Teams phones, you&#x27;ll know that even with autosign in there are times the devices sign out. Users press buttons, bad updates happen, or in some cases they just seem to randomly sign out. Every teams admin I&#x27;ve ever talked to usually starts by confidently saying they don&#x27;t have that problem before coming back later in the conversation and saying something similar to &quot;Well we did have a few devices sign out but that was because the password expired&quot; or similar. 
 If you&#x27;re familiar with Kari&#x27;s law the basic premise is that there can be no barrier whatsoever to dialing 911. If it&#x27;s a phone, you should not have to dial an outside line or take any special action to dial. But if you look at a teams phone, every single one says &quot;Sign in to make an emergency call&quot;
 How is that legal? I genuinely do not understand how, or how people are getting around this. Surely if an organization is using teams as a phone system with physical phones they&#x27;re non compliant with Kari&#x27;s law? 
 What am I missing? Even with auto sign in there isn&#x27;t a way to 100% guarantee a phone wont get signed out. 
 I get that there&#x27;s other issues here that need to be addressed. The need for cellular backup in case the internet goes down, or backup power for the phone system. And yes, I fully understand &#x27;most people just use their cellphones&#x27;, but I&#x27;m specifically wanting to address teams phones in this context because the way I see it, there&#x27;s no way to be compliant with Kari&#x27;s law unless you have someone physically checking each and every phone multiple times a day, even if it&#x27;s in the hallway rather than being assigned to a user.

                              <span>Our organization has a mix of A1 and A3 licenses. Currently users have to change their password on prem and that sync to the cloud. We are considering enabling SSPR but couldn&#x27;t find what will happen if an A1 user attempts to change their password in the cloud? Will it be denied? Will it let them change it in the cloud but not sync back to our on prem server? Will it let them change it and sync back but technically they aren&#x27;t licensed to do so?

                              <span>So I&#x27;m a networking guy, NOT a linux guy unfortunately so I&#x27;m coming at this from a very green position. We&#x27;ve used RANCID in the past but viewvc has been giving us fits for a while and Oxidized looks pretty cool so I decided to give it a shot.
 I installed it on Ubuntu and I got it to the point where oxidized is running as a service and I can see the configs it&#x27;s capturing but I&#x27;ve been unable to get nginx working to access it on the web. If I&#x27;m understanding it right (and I may not be), Oxidized is running a local web server on port 8888 and nginx is supposed to listen on port 80 (and 443) and then reverse proxys web traffic to the oxidized site.
 Right now when I go to the server on the web I get a 502 Bad Gateway message and I&#x27;m not sure what needs to change. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s something in the nginx.conf or sites-enabled/default files but I&#x27;m not sure.
 Here&#x27;s the current (sanitized) contents of my /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default file: https://pastebin.com/Dx2jrEDU
 And here&#x27;s the /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default: https://pastebin.com/KfGnJk16
 Like I said, I&#x27;m not a Linux guy so please take it easy on me :)

A 39-year-old Florida man pleaded guilty Tuesday to selling hundreds of millions of dollars of counterfeit Cisco gear to unsuspecting schools, hospitals, government agencies, and the military.
 According to the US Justice Department, between 2013 and 2022 Onur Aksoy, based in Miami, founded at least 19 companies in New Jersey and Florida and launched 15 Amazon and 10 eBay storefronts from which he peddled &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of low-quality or faulty networking devices gussied up to look like new or official Cisco equipment.
 The goods, imported from sellers in China and Hong Kong, were often loaded with pirated Cisco software and packaged within Cisco boxes bearing Cisco labels and stickers. Documentation was also made to look legitimate, the Justice Department said.
  
I&#x27;m sure it will only be a matter of time before some of the big name suppliers start using this guy as a scare tactic to funnel sales back their way.

 Am based in South East Asia and trying to get my hands dirty with cloud solutions as my core functionality is mainly *nix, infrastructure ( VMWARE ) and automation (picking up Ansible and Terraform).
 My question to my fellow sysadmins, what is the best path moving forward from here, as am not much into people management and utterly dismal in terms of documentation.
 Any pointers will help. Thanks.

Currently in a painful position where majority of the apps are deployed by PowerShell on start up, however keeping these applications updated is a sort of lets say semi manual process as new version of applications cannot be installed over the top, some applications for example teams machine wide have to be removed first etc. How are others doing it at present ?.

                              <span>Hi All.
 ​
 I have 4 domain controllers currently at domain functional level of 2008 and I have a number of VMS which run server 2016/19 and windows 10 21h2/22h2. I have recently noticed that our policy definitions are quite old and I wanted to find out what the best way is to update these and what is best practice to ensure none of the GPO&#x27;s breaks in the process. Is there anything which I need to be mindful of ? 
 ​
 Thank you all

 And the answer was, at a quick glance, pretty OK. (below). Given chatgpt&#x27;s ability to make plausible stuff up, I&#x27;m not sure if this is a great thing or aa world of pain lying in wait.
 When dealing with an oversized transaction log file in Microsoft SQL Server, the following steps can be taken to address the issue when the shrink command does not reduce the file size:
  
Check the database recovery model: Ensure that the database is in the full or bulk-logged recovery model. If it is set to the simple recovery model, the transaction log will not shrink.
 
Backup the transaction log: Create a backup of the transaction log using the BACK…</span>

 I go two folders up - &quot;../../&quot; Two folders inside to get the json file - &quot;../../Config/Dev/xxx-setting.json&quot;
 Using just - &quot;Config/Dev/xxx-setting.json&quot; would give me - &quot;Jwt settings file not found, hmac settings file not found. API key doesn&#x27;t exist&quot;
 But when I use &quot;../../Config/Dev/xxx-setting.json&quot;
 I get JWT setting file doesnt exist. Unhandled Exception. System.IO.FileNotFoundException.
  
and some error related to the application parsing? I am not sure.
  
What do you think is going wrong here and what can I do?

 I have a 2012R2 server (Last one in production with update planned prior to soon EOL) which still has Flash Active X installed. KB4577586 has been set to install in WSUS for all device groups and has installed succesfully on all other servers and endpoints. 
 I&#x27;ve also tried manually downloading from the Microsoft update catalog but when ran i&#x27;m told &quot;this update is not applicable on your computer&quot;.
 Anyone else had similar? Recent updates continue to install no issue including all monthly and the recent quarterly security roll-ups.

                              <span>Had a meetup with a friend from a previous job, one that I actually got to apply to the position via reddit, and he said he just got approved to block reddit starting on the 12th in the corporate firewall.
 I asked if he was only going to block it for a couple days as part of the blackout but apparently he got the permanent block approved by the VP. It won&#x27;t be accessible on their internal network or their guest wifi, and he&#x27;s expecting to piss off a few people with this change.
 We discussed setting similar blocks in our home networks for a couple days and seeing how we do - thought that might appeal to a few people here since it looks like this sub will be staying up. You might also consider setting up blocking at work as well if that&#x27;s plausible. I work for a giant megacorp so I&#x27;m not even going to try, but having worked at some small places it&#x27;s definitely something I would have put forth there.

                              <span>Recently I stumbled over the new features that Microsoft tries to implement in Windows and Office 365. 
 Especially the &quot;new&quot; Outlook app. The &quot;new&quot; app looks basically Outlook.office.com but as a Modern app. Most Add-Ins didn&#x27;t work like online and in general the app felt worse then the Web app. 
 A few days ago I heard in a webcast, that Microsoft probably does not continue the development of active directory which could result in an push towards Azure AD.
 Today I read about upcoming changes to the explorer and the &quot;Home menu&quot; looks like the start Menu from Microsoft 365. 
 This all feels like Microsoft wants to force users to get in touch with the existing cloud infrastructure and wants to push the cloud services more than only migrating Server VMs to azure. 
 This scenario is quite unrealistic, but I think this could be happening more in the future. 
 Does anybody feel the same way?

 They are failling because the IPs are marked as dangerous, its an simple password (not 2FA) and coming from a not allowed geography
 Is it possible to block it completely?

                              <span>Everybody hello,
 Wednesday, a recruiter cab called me to asks if I was potentially interested in new offers. I told yes, then he told me he has a DevOps offer. So, I am working as system &amp; network admin since 2.5 years in my company (its my first job, i&#x27;m 24). The thing is they were looking for an experienced DevOps, which im obviously not.
 So, they anyways wanted to meet me, yesterday eve I went to the company (~150 employees), they told me they were considering taking me as mid-time DevOps &amp; mid-time sysadmin at the beginning to help me getting skills on DevOps, and after some months if needed, I would be a full DevOps.
 The point is they have also needs on sysadmin side, and Im pretty much experimented on sysadmin, so all of this sounds fair to me, the business looks nice, great office, great work schedule, everything.
 Does this offer sounds really fair? Is it a redflag? Is there something I should really be care of? Whats you guys opinion on it? (I am really about to accept)

                              <span>hi there! 
 I have an issue with opendkim. The problem is that it allows emails without attachments from the sender, but it blocks emails with attachments from the same sender. The sender is using O365. It&#x27;s possible that the headers are changing somehow after the attachment is added, dunno. I tried adding the sender&#x27;s domain to the trusted host list, but the issue still persists.
 thoughts?

                              <span>Hi folks, I have been running a little website gathering some links I need daily.
 It&#x27;s made with Nginx, and using a Let&#x27;s Encrypt Certificate. 
 There was no issue since 9 months, but yesterday, Chrome is saying my website is unsafe, because of phishing and stuff. The certificate is not expired. 
 I used the Google support to see if this was an error, but I don&#x27;t have any answer yet.
 Has anyone of you ever got this problem?

 I have a question and I would like your advice and insight.
 I&#x27;ve been in it for 5+ years and I&#x27;m about to take my CCNA test. My current job, I have no access to the network and I have only been there for 5 months.
 So my question is: If I pass my CCNA test, should I start looking for a job that needs a network guy or stay for a year or two so employers don&#x27;t question why I&#x27;m hopping my job so fast? 
 Thanks for your advice
 Ps: my ultimate goals to be network security with azure administration sprinkled in.

 He asked me the other day about YouTubers he should follow to learn about IT concepts, learn about new tools, tutorials/how-to content, etc. He is eager to learn but has a hard time reading long form blogs and finds video content way more easier to digest. (Something about that generation…but I digress). I recommended NetworkChuck but need some more suggestions for him.
 Who are your favorite YouTubers to learn about IT stuff? He’s interesting in everything — networking, security, coding, devops, etc.

                              <span>I have a multitude of backups now, and am now trying to restore from backup in WSB via USB bootable, with backups on a different USB. 
 First problem, if I am booted to WinServ2019Essentials, the WSB times out when looking for a backup on the USB drive.
 So I boot via USB and chose recover, it takes about 2 hours to scan the USB for a recovery file, it finds it and then when I say to execute it I get error &quot;The system restore has failed. No disk that can be used for recovery can be found&quot;
 Now the internet has a variety of answers, from WSB is deprecated and won&#x27;t work, all the way to attempting to partition and format the drives exactly as they were.
 Second issue, I don&#x27;t know how to determine how many partitions and exactly their sizes. 
 Can any of you syswizards help me out here?
 I am absolutely trying to avoid manually installing and rebuilding of the server due to so many 3rd party integrations and exe.

No, $5 more an hour still doesn&#x27;t get me interested in a job 1.5 hours drive away with zero benefits... Sorry bub. (The distance thing is because I live in the DFW Metroplex, and is an added annoyance that they never bother to even look on a map at what kind of drive I&#x27;d be making, and of course, most of those jobs are either 1 day from home or fully on-site) 
 I&#x27;m assuming they&#x27;re just scraping job sites and trying to make a quick buck, but does anyone go for these jobs?

                              <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;ve done a bit of googling about this but haven&#x27;t really gotten an answer I&#x27;m happy with.
 I&#x27;ve been playing around with Netbox to demo, and I&#x27;ve been importing our addressing and VLANs. My concern is with how VLANs are handled. It seems like it&#x27;s not possible to say &quot;vlan 1 is globally Desktops,&#x27; for example, and have all org-wide site-specific Desktop prefixes be assigned to, and appear under, the same VLAN object. Is this correct? 
 Right now I have (for example) a &quot;site_vlans&quot; vlan group for multiple sites, and an individual &quot;vlan 1&quot; assigned to each group/site. This is all well and good, but suppose you have 100 VLANs and 10 sites. Are you required to maintain 1000 VLAN records in Netbox? Seems unwieldy. 
 Thanks.

Spoke switches are a mix of older generation 3650, 3850, and newer 9300. One of the spoke legs is also its own hub in a separate building. This switch is a 9300X-24Y (24 x 25G SFP), and off of it has a mix of older 2960 and newer 9300-48Us. 
 For a while now we have received complaints about poor download speed from locations in this building.

                              <span>Happy Friday everyone, 
 So, I manage a hotel&#x27;s Wifi service. A recent change I made for them was to set their QoS bandwidth cap for their free GUEST wifi network to 10Mbps. After applying the update, I went to the hotels lobbies to test it out with my laptop. Interestingly enough, I&#x27;m getting on avg. about 4-6Mbps speeds and I&#x27;m also seeing that it will fluctuate from 5Mbps, then burst to 8Mpbs, then back to 4Mbps and so on and so on. I&#x27;m assuming this is normal behavior you see when you&#x27;ve placed a bandwidth cap on the wifi network, but I&#x27;m not 100% on this. If not, let me know.
 When I&#x27;m on the casino floors, I&#x27;m getting correct QoS speeds (The property is a hotel &amp; Casino), I&#x27;m also seeing burst here and there but overall speeds are right on the money.
 Currently using Cisco WLC3504 with Cisco 2802i APs.
 This might be an easy answer for some of you Wireless Cisco ninjas. I appreciate any thoughts and inputs you might have.
 ​
 Thank you.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I am working in a company which develops safety-critical application. The company (railway operator) which uses our system in the field wants us to join their already deployed MPLS network. In this case, we need to share the network infrastructure with other systems like CCTV, IP phone etc. Otherwise we are going to install our closed loop for communication between control center and remote equipments, which is a general approach we have taken so far. Our concerns for sharing the common network devices with other systems are bandwidth, latency and security.
 As far as I know CCTV data is prioritized in MPLS QoS. Can our safety-critic data be prioritized higher than CCTV packets?
 Also in case of a failure in other subsystems, may a technician misconfigure the MPLS router in a troubleshooting process so that our routing configuration also be affected badly?
 I remember that with RSVP, pre-defined bandwidth can be allocated to a specific tunnel, can we rely on that?
 The good side of entering to MPLS network is that we don&#x27;t need to spend a great amount of equipment cost to deploy our separate network. Also we won&#x27;t need to worry for failures and maintenance.
 In case we decide to involve to MPLS network, we need some commitments from operator on bandwidth reservation and max latency we are going to experience, right?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I am hoping to get some feedback on how to improve my HA setup between my active/passive FortiGates, and a Cisco Nexus vPC pair acting as the layer3 core. 
 Here is the topology with relevant config:
 https://i.ibb.co/hcmxVTs/Forti-Gate-Nexus.png
 Each FortiGate has two interfaces configured in an aggregate (ports 2 and 4). FortiGate1&#x27;s ports 2 and 4 are plugged into Nexus1&#x27;s ports 1 and 2. The same is done for FortiGate2.
 When I added the second Nexus, I initially tried connecting port 2 from each FortiGate into the same Nexus, and port 4 from each FortiGate into the other. However, this caused unexpected behavior. I can&#x27;t exactly recall what happened, as there were a number of issues I was troubleshooting during this time.
 Fast forward a few months, I noticed Po5 was down on Nexus1, and Po4 was down on Nexus2. I removed these port channels and quickly realized this caused an outage.
 I have an opportunity for a maintenance window this weekend and would like to improve this setup if possible. Would anyone who has implemented a similar topology be willing to expand on their HA configuration?
 Many thanks!

                              <span>I have a fairly simple network, outlined below. For the question in particular, two subnets in their own VLAN.
 I have a service running in VLAN1000, lets say it&#x27;s a webserver. I have forwarded 443/tcp from my WAN interface to this machine, and it works fine from the outside.
 From VLAN5, however, it doesn&#x27;t work properly. It requires either split horizon DNS or hairpin NAT. I&#x27;m currently using split horizon DNS, but that only works for machines were I can control DNS, which I can&#x27;t for some computers. It also doesn&#x27;t work with some services just using IPs.
 I&#x27;d like to implement a hairpin NAT rule which works with my dynamic WAN IP. I can&#x27;t find any relevant documentation on this, but I&#x27;m probably missing something obvious.
 How do I implement this?

                              <span>Update: Apparently I needed to enable PFS on both sides. It&#x27;s working now.
 I&#x27;ve been able to get a VPN tunnel established between an ASA 5555-X with Public Static IP Address and a Cisco RV320 which has a 4G LTE (Verizon) USB modem attached. It completes Phase 1 and Phase 2 setup of the VPN tunnel but I&#x27;m not getting any data to pass. The ASA side show #pkts encaps and #pkts encrypted counters increasing but the #pkts decaps never increase from 0.
 The RV320 shows its IP Address is 100.121.189.168, however that is not the IP I&#x27;m using to establish the tunnel. I&#x27;m using the address that I see when going to ipchicken.com. Of course, the RV320 doesn&#x27;t have the best debugging/logging capabilities.
 Any ideas if this is possible?

                              <span>We&#x27;re running into a serious headache trying to get our Clearpass to work with our Cisco Switches.
 As configured our older IOS switches work just fine, but we have a nagging problem that only affects our 3850s.
 Wondering if anyone knows what we are missing here...
 When trying to authenticate via EAP-TLS, it skips the 802.1x wired service policy and is processed by the MAC Auth service policy even though the service identifies that it has a cert issued by the internal CA

                              <span>My company is a large global corporation. We currently have aging Cisco switches and access points. My management is strongly considering Fortinet for switching and wireless. I have heard great things about Juniper/Mist from friends who have deployed it. Any insights into Fortinet switching and wireless. I know their firewalls are considered really good but have heard not so great things about their switches and APs.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not exactly strong on networking so bare with me here please. 
 We have have a large list of subnets which have a list of contacts that are responsible for them. We have Infoblox for management, however, it does not support having specific groups/users for many different subnets. If there is an issue with a specific subnet a 3rd party contacts these groups/users to notify them about a problem with their subnet. What do you guys usually use or would recommend using for this? 
 We are currently looking at Nautobot as it supports Infoblox integration. But as far as I can tell it does not support users/groups for subnets either. Currently we are using an old database with basically all manual entry which is less than ideal. I don&#x27;t know if what I am asking makes any sense to you guys but if not then please ask for clarification. I appreciate any help I can get on this.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m a networking guy, NOT a linux guy unfortunately so I&#x27;m coming at this from a very green position. We&#x27;ve used RANCID in the past but viewvc has been giving us fits for a while and Oxidized looks pretty cool so I decided to give it a shot.
 I installed it on Ubuntu and I got it to the point where oxidized is running as a service and I can see the configs it&#x27;s capturing but I&#x27;ve been unable to get nginx working to access it on the web. If I&#x27;m understanding it right (and I may not be), Oxidized is running a local web server on port 8888 and nginx is supposed to listen on port 80 (and 443) and then reverse proxys web traffic to the oxidized site.
 Right now when I go to the server on the web I get a 502 Bad Gateway message and I&#x27;m not sure what needs to change. I&#x27;m pretty sure it&#x27;s something in the nginx.conf or sites-enabled/default files but I&#x27;m not sure.
 Here&#x27;s the current (sanitized) contents of my /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default file: https://pastebin.com/Dx2jrEDU
 And here&#x27;s the /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default: https://pastebin.com/KfGnJk16
 ​
 Like I said, I&#x27;m not a Linux guy so please take it easy on me :)

                              <span>Hey Folks!
 Looking for help of the collective group as something surely has to exist already for this…
 We have an operations team that is 24x7. They respond and action to various alerts. My team has developed very detailed process on how to respond to these alerts (ex. device down). The process is currently documented in a flow chart and we’re looking at next steps to bring this to our Operations Team.
 I’d love to be able to have something that is user input driven - I’m imagining something web-based that prompts them for Yes or No / Choice A or B type inputs and then leads them to the next steps.
 For example…device down…. Is there an active change being performed by the Network Team or vendor? (Yes/No). Based on the selection the next input would be something like… IF No… Is it a single device down or multiple… and so on.
 I’d love this format over something like an incredibly long word document with anchors.
 Here’s an example of something that I found - albeit maybe really out and outdated(?) - that paints a picture.

 10.244.50.0 
 Known via 
 1) 10.0.0.0/8
 2) 10.0.0.0/16 
  
Both via EIGRP
 Both pointing to the same next hop address
 same AD for both (170 - external EIGRP)
 Same metric for both (25626112)
 Same ubest/mbest for both (2/0)
  
So I&#x27;m trying to determine why the /8 is preferred over the /16.

 -and powershell command &quot;Get-NetFirewallRule -DisplayGroup &quot;Network Policy Server&quot; | where DisplayName -like &quot;RADIUS&quot; | Set-NetFirewallRule -Service Any&quot; 
 I applied all of this and still not working, I am still not receiving logs in the event viewer and I need help :(

 It seems that Arista is in a lot of the hyperscale data centers whereas Cisco is less so is there a specific reason?

                              <span>Hello readers,
 I have a AS5400XM Gateway (old, very old, lol), that is currently password locked. There&#x27;s no documentation whatsoever. Whether it be online or at work. I use SuperPuTTy and am reverse SSH over an AYSYNC line. I have absolutely no idea as to why I&#x27;m not able to break into ROMMON, first off, the unit boots really fast lol, and second there is no text direction in the CLI telling me what break combination to use. 
 ​
 I have one last idea and that is am going to use reverse Telnet over the AYSYNC lines and use the &quot;Special Commands&quot; drop down in SuperPuTTy.
 ​
 Any help would be much appreciated! 
 ​
 THANK YOU!!

 What monitoring software do you know of that supports/monitors Cloudgenix devices (Prisma SD-WAN)? That can also integrate with Cisco Meraki and Service Now.

                              <span>I feel like the last few years I’ve seen “Network Engineer” jobs become such a conglomeration of skills — everything from scripting to windows administration, SDN, Linux, MPLS and VPNs, all done by one person. Has anyone else been feeling lately like the career field is expanding as a side/additional skill set to Administration?

                              <span>Howdy folks, I’m a networking novice and just looking for some help troubleshooting an issue I’m having with the network I maintain/administrate for an event production company. Network is fairly simple with just a handful of VLAN’s, RSTP, DHCP reservations/assignments, and IGMP snooping. 
 Now, onto the setup; switch (Cisco CBS-350 8 port switch in a touring enclosure) has just two VLANs active: VLAN 11 and VLAN 21, with VLAN 1 being the native VLAN as per Cisco standard. One PC on VLAN 11, and one device functioning as a ping responder on VLAN 21. 
 The problem I’m having is the pc on VLAN 11 is able to ping the gateway for VLAN 21, as well as ping the device on VLAN 21 (though the ping only makes it TO the other device, it is not able to be sent back to VLAN 11). Problem only seems to arise when the PC is provided an IP with DCHP, when the PC is set to static IP in the same range I’m unable to ping the gateway of other VLANs. Feel free to ask any questions about the setup that I may not have answered, I’m sure I missed some things. TIA.

                              <span>Can anyone recommend a good make of Serial console server to manage Cisco, Arista and Palo Alto devices. Up until now I have used Raritan, but they seem to be completely unable to deliver any devices. I ordered several over a year ago, and they keep pushing back the delivery date, so I am looking for an alternate.
 I would like them to have dual LAN ports for resilience, Dual PSU and connect to the Console port using a standard CAT5 with no adapters. Up to 48 ports.

                              <span>from what i&#x27;ve seen on a bgp intro, when setting up bgp you need a /24 to advertise. We already have 3x /24 public IP blocks on hand but some of those IPs have servers assigned to them already. my question is, do i still need to acquire another /24 block just for bgp use or can we use what we currently have? i guess i&#x27;m stuck on the &#x27;advertise&#x27; part. my thinking is we&#x27;re advertising routes a&#x27;la ospf, but to the world this time. 
 i apologize if this sounds elementary. i&#x27;m working with a contractor overseas so i&#x27;m basically the remote hands and in charge of fulfilling requirements, etc. this is my first time working on bgp as you can tell.

 ​
  
Advertise 1st /24 + /23 ISP-A
 Advertise 2nd /24 + /23 ISP-B
  
Would the longest match prefix rule be considered ahead of BGP best path ? In this scenarios ISP-A is Cogent and ISP-B is Lumen. Would advertising the /23 provide failover in the event one side was lost ? One last thought, would the IP range being owned by the end user vs it being leased from a providers range impact this. Say you leased the /23 via Lumen and its part of /16 supernet they advertise via their own AS. This is just a hypothetical although I did once see something similar to this in production and did not have chance to verify if it actually worked as intended.
 ## ISP A - BGP # Inbound: Default Route # Outbound: 30.0.0.0/24 30.0.0.0/23 ## ISP B - BGP ## # Inbound: Default Route # Outbound: 30.0.1.0/24 30.0.0.0/23

                              <span>Looking to replace a Netgear GS748Tv4H1 switch that&#x27;s been in production since 2012. It has worked well (with the exception of a fan replacement a few years ago) but I recently deployed a new batch of workstations that have Intel i225/226 ethernet ports. For some unexplained reason, these computers will show &quot;Network disconnected&quot; unless I manually set the link speed to 10Mb. My troubleshooting process has narrowed it down to some issue with the Netgear switch. Anyway, management has approved a replacement switch, and I was rather hoping to find something that has at least some 2.5Gb ports as the PC&#x27;s with the i225/226 ports all support that speed. Most of the cables have already been replaced with CAT6 already.
 No fancy networking scenarios here, just a single location of 40 or so mixed devices and the only requirement is LACP for the link aggregates on two Windows servers and a NAS. I will have to replace the WiFi setup as well so the 2.5Gb ports will come in handy for that and POE would be a plus but not a requirement. Having researched for the past few days I&#x27;ve come up with these:
 Juniper EX2300-48MP (16 x 2.5 GbE ports)
 EnGenius ECS2552FP (16 x 2.5 GbE port)
 FS S5800-48MBQ (48 x 2.5 GbE ports)
 People seem to have fairly positive things to say about the Juniper and I&#x27;m leaning that way (if I can find it in stock anywhere in Canada). However, I&#x27;m just wondering if I&#x27;m getting myself into a much more complicated situation that requires support contracts and subscriptions to cloud things and other enterprise-y stuff that I don&#x27;t need. I abandoned Cisco years ago because the beancounters didn&#x27;t want to pay for the yearly support contract and I couldn&#x27;t get any firmware updates after that. I did have an account rep at CDW that I would go to for info but seems they&#x27;re ghosting me. Am I fine just purchasing the hardware or should I really try to find a different VAR to make sure I&#x27;m getting everything I need?

                              <span>Hello, my org is in a highly regulated industry, and we have a parent company that manages and is responsible for the WAN network for all companies like ours.
 They will not provide us a list of devices and firmwares and instead work with auditors directly. It is kind of crazy.
 But the question I have is all of our 20 or so locations have ancient dumb Cisco ISRs (1900s I believe) - these are all on a MPLS network that go to some kind of Fortinet gateway in their data center.
 Each location has a simple flat VLAN (they refuse to budge on this), so these devices don&#x27;t really do any routing, the gateway/MPLS would handle all of that.
 Still I am wondering what kind of vulnerablities or risks this might bring.
 We and other orgs are leaving them for a SD-WAN+ZTNA/Zscaler setup, but that won&#x27;t be for some time.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Long story short, I&#x27;ve received a SNMP-related task and don&#x27;t really know how to conclude it. I don&#x27;t have a networking background, I&#x27;m mostly a programmer. I&#x27;m running Oracle Linux, for info. 
 I need to implement SNMP v3 communication between the user and an agent, which I was able to do and is working as expected. I would like to add an extra layer of security using certificates, and this is the part that I am having issues with. I can generate and sign the certificates just fine, but what should be the content of snmpd.conf? It seems that all I try, the SNMP commands work either with or without the certificates, and I&#x27;m not able to find a conclusive example. I feel I&#x27;m missing something, any thoughts?

 If you have used BMC remedy, what are your experience with it? The whole system and layout seems outdated. I do know they used to be a big name years ago?

I am reminding myself of the various switches that make DCDIAG spit out useful things and in the course of doing so, stumbled on documentation about ADREPLSTATUS which looks like a handy-dandy tool for just this kind of thing. 
 But, as Murphy would have it, Microsoft&#x27;s article about it opens with:

 Talk about timing! 
 Has anyone got an alternate source I can grab this..... oh, nevermind.... I see there&#x27;s a MSFT engineer that has decided to take it on as a personal project. I was about to delete his whole post and score one more point for good ole rubber-duck troubleshooting, but I guess maybe someone might find it ss useful to leave a breadcrumb trail to point here:

 I had on my calendar to do this in August around the 3-month mark but with the uncertainty of my continued presence on reddit I&#x27;m going to do it now. 
 I realize I&#x27;m still in the &quot;honeymoon&quot; phase but so far I&#x27;m loving every aspect of the new role. The hours are flexible, my boss and the team is amazing, I&#x27;m learning a ton, and possibly most of all am taking a huge step forward in my career.
 I won&#x27;t say there haven&#x27;t been challenges, going from a company of 80 to one of 350k means a lot of bureaucracy. Still waiting for some higher-level access to my laptop but at least I have an Azure VM I can work in with full admin rights. 
 I will also note, probably unsurprisingly, this is the first week I&#x27;ve felt like I can actually contribute to the team. I setup an Azure VM for one of the offshore folks and was able to do a DB restore and push to Azure SQL for some mock data.
 Anyway, yeah that&#x27;s about it at the moment. Happy to answer questions if I can without doxing myself and all that happy crap.
 Oh, and I will re-iterate from the last time, the outpouring of support from this community was amazing and I truly appreciated all the positive comments and good will. 
 Cheers!

                              <span>Hello r/sysadmin!
 I have been tasked to write up an “IT Security Overview” to educate a potential new insurer. I have an idea where to start but I could easily make it way to complicated. I am good at that. My idea is to focus it at c-level execs so I can use it for more than one purpose. 
 Some Items I want to include but not limited to
  
 VPN vendor 
  vendor list in general
  MFA status on all services (internal and external)
  Server and Windows Versions
  what outdated software/hardware we have (none)
  Our backup strat (mediums, encryption, testing schedule)
  potentially ACLs on VLANs and VPNs?
  past infections/any data loss (none)
  software update schedule 
 maybe even as far as what firewalls we use. 
  
Does anyone have any other thoughts?
 thanks for listening!

                              <span>Yesterday, I was managing multiple systems using remote desktop. The desktop I had to use only had one monitor so I had to keep switching between my local desktop and the remote desktop windows. A really annoying issue with this type of setup is using keyboard shortcuts (combinations) in windowed mode for remote desktop is the short cut (i.e. Window+R, Windows+E, etc...)would apply to the local desktop instead of the remote host.
 So I decided to take a look at the advanced settings for RDP and found a setting that I don&#x27;t remember being there last time I looked (many years ago), and under &quot;Local Resources&quot; &gt; &quot;Apply Windows key combinations&quot; was the solution to this annoying issue. There you can select the option to apply the keyboard shortcuts/combinations to the remote computer, instead of &quot;Only when using the full screen&quot;.
 I figured I would share, because I mentioned this to some of my teammates and they didn&#x27;t know about this setting either.
 Edit: Thank you kind stranger for the Gold award!

                              <span>Fun story for the day:
 I was looking at the networked devices the other day at work and came across a Chevy Suburban hopping between access points. My two thoughts were, &quot;I really need to change the Wi-Fi password&quot; and &quot;Cars can connect to Wi-Fi now?&quot; I blocked it from the network without a second thought.
 Today I get a ticket in saying, &quot;If you have the time today, my picture frame isn’t on the wifi anymore.
 I was just wondering if you could fix it.&quot; I tried throwing in the password to no avail. It just wouldn&#x27;t take. I reset the device, turned Wi-Fi off, nothing. It finally clicked that the digital picture frame was being listed as a Chevy Suburban in my connected devices! It was a quick switch to unblock it, and I got a nice lesson in Don&#x27;t do stuff without knowing what you&#x27;re doing.

ACTION NOTICE: Impacted ESG appliances must be immediately replaced regardless of patch version level. If you have not replaced your appliance after receiving notice in your UI, contact support now 
 Barracuda’s remediation recommendation at this time is full replacement of the impacted ESG.
  
I wonder how deep the malware hit if a restore from backups / factory reflash wouldn&#x27;t be enough.

                              <span>We have a Windows Server 2003 running on a physical machine in an AD environment with about 150 users. The server needs to be retired and I need a way to copy over all 18 TB of data to a new machine. My options are migrating the data to either a new Windows Server or a Synology NAS.
 The old server has only about 1 TB of space left, so P2V tools like disk2vhd wouldn&#x27;t work (assuming that the VM has to created on the server itself). Veeam is also not an option, since its client doesn&#x27;t support the old OS. I looked into Synology&#x27;s &quot;Active Backup for Business&quot;, but I&#x27;ve never used it and I&#x27;m not sure if it would work.
 What do you think is the best option? I&#x27;d really appreciate some advice.

                              <span>In short, my job restricts connections through VPN and I&#x27;m trying to circumvent this without being detected.
 My reasoning is that commercial VPNs, like NordVPN or others won&#x27;t work, as they typically have the same IP addresses and can be detected that way.
 The home VPN, however, should in theory not be distinguishable from a &quot;regular&quot; connection.
 Is my assumption correct, or are there other factors that could give out the information that a user is connected through a VPN?

                              <span>I used the Diceware method to create my master password. It suggested I also add a memorable number to the end of my password so I decided to just put my current age. For some reason, finally using a password manager felt like a big moment. I remember making that password vividly. I remember exactly where I was, what the furniture looked like, etc.
 Now every day when I enter my master password I realize how much time has passed. I&#x27;m coming up on a decade since and every time I get further from that number, my mortality sets in. I can&#x27;t believe it&#x27;s been a decade from that point in time. I would not recommend it.
 Which brings me to my main question; how often do you change your master password if at all? Any system for doing so?

                              <span>Hello fellows sysadmins, Do some Android or iOS system based device exist with the possibility to install apps from the store? I&#x27;m working as an MSP and really fed up with all the vendors forcing us to install their MFA apps. 
 I don&#x27;t want to install dozen of apps doing just random TOTP or push notification on my personal phone. I&#x27;m using hardware token (YubiKey) on everything that can accept it but there is always exception. 
 I could just buy a second phone for this purpose but I think it&#x27;s a bit overkill and didn&#x27;t find any Android based device for this purpose. Do you know something similar?

                              <span>My head of security wants to explore virtual desktops specifically for contractors, to reduce the need for us to ship expensive laptops to contractors that require access to company systems, which is what we&#x27;re doing now.
 I haven&#x27;t explored the VDI space in about 10 years, though I&#x27;m familiar with some of the more common solutions like Windows 365 and VMWare. However I haven&#x27;t worked with any of them or tested any of their offerings recently.
 The basic idea is that these contractors don&#x27;t need a specific operating system since almost all of our services are web based, and we&#x27;d issue them a low(er) cost device like a Chromebook in lieu of a Macbook if they actually needed hardware, or they could access the VM securely via a personal computer.
 Can anyone comment on modern solutions?

                              <span>We have a couple of IIS websites (intranet on Sharepoint and ADFS for Dynamics 365) running in our on-prem AD environment. Up until recently SSO from browsers such as Chrome and Edge was functioning properly.
 Now all of a sudden several users are complaining that SSO does not work, regardless of using Chrome or Edge. It doesn&#x27;t matter which user logs on to the computer, SSO still will not work, and the user has to type in username and password.
 If we run &quot;gpupdate /force /target:computer&quot; on the problematic computer, SSO works just fine.
 If user restarts computer the same problem occurs again, until &quot;gpupdate /force /target:computer&quot; is run again.
 Configuration is correct,
  
Integrated Windows Authentication is enabled
 
Automatic logon only in Intranet zone is enabled on the Intranet zone settings (user settings GPO)
 
The urls of the websites belong to the intranet zone
 
 Does anyone know what could be causing this intermittent fall out of SSO, or if there are tools that can be used to troubleshoot/log the reason why it&#x27;s not working, when it stops working? 
 Clients are running Win10 Enterprise 21H2.

                              <span>As with a lot of businesses, we are using O365 that is synced to our local AD structure. We also have all accounts protected with MFA.
 We have have recently have had the honor of dealing with someone (probably a script) trying to compromise a couple of C level users. As sole IT, it makes it hard on me because it is constantly locking out these two users and I am unlocking them 3 or 4 times a day. One user&#x27;s attack lasted maybe 3 or 4 days before they quit. The other user&#x27;s attack has been going on for over a week. It was constant for the first few days but has waned a bit recently. 
 What do you guys do when this happens? Anything I can do to cut down the downtime these users are experiencing as a result?

                              <span>I am a one man IT department in a new to me organization. I’m looking into RMM solution for remote monitoring/access, patch management, and endpoint security. 
 The most important piece to me would be the reliability of their patch management software. 
 I have trialed Ninja, Syncro, Pulseway, N-Central, and Atera. 
 However, I can’t find an up-to-date reviews of the platforms. Most of the ratings are 2+ plus years old in and I know much can change in that given time. 
 Does anyone here at sysadmin have any recommendations?

 I&#x27;ve never used this backup software before, so just checking if it&#x27;s a solid option to keep using, or if I should be pushing to replace it with something like Veeam? Anyone have experience with it?

 Have a client that houses people with mental health conditions. Some of those people have suffered through scams ending with them losing thousands of dollars to people pretending to be women. 
 Asking here and a few other places. 
 Do you know of any resources or technology that could help prevent or react to this type of situation? 
 They&#x27;re using personal devices on a personal network with little supervision. Don&#x27;t know if there&#x27;s a technical answer here or if we&#x27;re just stuck with reinforcing on the social side.

 After years of battling with the Marketing/Graphic department and their 20 To of data. I installed Photoprism in Docker and showed the Manager the logic of looking for a tool instead of our flat file server windows 2019. the file server have a basic setup, shares, NTFS, and a lot of folders et sub folders. lots of duplicates...
 Ideally:
 selfhosted software
 open source able to connect to the NTFS share to index
 multi users with rights access
 capable of handling videos, pictures, RAW photo format, adobe suite format
 auto tagging, duplicate finding tool, poll system, etc etc
 project management solution or link available with one? ( i know it exist some software special for marketing people where they can push automatically their photoshop (adobe suite) file to a portal and create workflow for approval by the other teams 
 thanks a lot for any idea

                              <span>Hey all, having a bit of trouble finding documentation around this. Is anyone aware what authentication method hp scanners use, ntlm or Kerberos?
 I did find some document around hp security and it referenced Kerberos but not specifically for the scanjet scanners.
 Thanks all!

                              <span>Hey folks,
 recently set up a VPS server with Windows Server 2022 featuring 8 CPU Threads, 8GB RAM.
 Using it for trading and stuff, so nothing wild performance wise, this is also reflected in the task manager with around 20-30% CPU usage and 50-60% RAM usage.
 But nonetheless, if accessed via MS RDP, it&#x27;s almost unusably unresponsive and laggy. Sometimes things don&#x27;t react to mouse clicks at all but as I said, the apps and stuff run smoothly, it&#x27;s only the GUI.
 Is this a limitation of RDP, are 3rd party apps more suitable (like AnyDesk, TeamViewer and stuff). Or can RDP be tuned?
 Internet connections are fast (100 and 400 Mbit&#x27;s for me and server) and the server is not too far away from me.
 Thanks for your help!

                              <span>Hello guys! i don&#x27;t know if this is the super-right place to writhe this down, but i&#x27;m out of options and need some help, and you guys are always amazing.
 we have a fairly simple configuration for Kuberntes ingress: aws alb receive in 443, forward to 80, and then move traffic to nginx ingress controllers that has services on the 80.
 up until now i never had a problem like this one, snipeit its driving me crazy, the only thing i can get from its ingress is a gateway timeout, and this happens only for its url, all the other applications are working
 log from the ingress controller:
 networking nginx-ingress-nginx-controller-x7j7v controller 2023/06/08 10:50:09 [error] 857#857: *22661 upstream timed out (110: Operation timed out) while connecting to upstream, client: client, server: snipeit.staging.k8s.domain, request: &quot;GET / HTTP/1.1&quot;, upstream: &quot;upstream&quot;, host: &quot;snipeit.staging.k8s.domain&quot; 
 pod of snipeit doesnt log anything sadly, im using the latest image since i have ARM cluster.
 thats my &quot;proxy&quot; configuration for snipeit, but i tested really almost everything and im starting to thing is a strange combo.
 APP_ALLOW_INSECURE_HOSTS: &quot;true&quot; APP_FORCE_TLS: &quot;true&quot; APP_TRUSTED_PROXIES: &quot;**&quot; APP_LOG_LEVEL: &quot;debug&quot; SECURE_COOKIES: &quot;true&quot; APP_URL: &quot;https://snipeit.staging.k8s.domain&quot; 
 here the ingress configuration:
 ingress: 
 annotations: nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/proxy-read-timeout: &quot;120&quot; nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/configuration-snippet: | more_set_headers &quot;X-Forwarded-Proto: https&quot;; path: / hosts: - snipeit.staging.k8s.jointly.pro pathType: Prefix
 also for refernce im using this chart. ; thank you in advance for whatever info you have.
 Really.

 Company wants us to only buy printers with a TPM2.0 chip, even small desk printers without a hard drive. My understanding is the TPM-chip only provides encryption to hard drives and that it won’t be any point of having one in a small disk less printer…?

 I&#x27;m looking into moving most of our project files into the cloud but after googling a bit it looks like a 50/50 risk where latency will be an issue because of how large they are. I bumped into azure file sync and wondering if anyone here has any success/fail experience with that? Also any testimonies where going to Azure for Autodesk programs would be great. FYI we do use bim collaborative for all new projects but have a lot of legacy projects that mgmt refuse to move over.

I&#x27;m currently working on a graduation project at my workplace, focusing on maintaining manageable yet secure remote access (RDP) connections for our support team. Our software company utilizes server providers or allows customers to host our software on their own servers. As we work with six different cloud server providers for our SaaS solution, connecting to these servers for support and software implementation is essential.
 To ensure the security of server connections, many of our (self-hosting)customers require MFA/2FA for all server access, including our own SaaS hosted customers. While we understand and appreciate their concerns, it presents a challenge for our support team since they connect to approximately 100 different customers each day. The repeated MFA prompts…</span>

                              <span>Would appreciate any help with this one.
 It is the first time I have looked at the switch (SG-500-52) since joining the company and the current manager doesn&#x27;t know the password. We don&#x27;t have any records for it. As a result, I am trying to run through the password recovery process.
 I am connected via DB9 into switch console port, DB9 to USB adapter into laptop. The adapter shows up as COM3 on device manager. I have followed the instructions for the baud rate, data bits etc but everytime I connect via Putty I just get a black screen.
 COM3 shows at the top and if I unplug the cable I get an error message. I have tried multiple different baud rates and a couple different drivers for the adapter cable but no luck.
 The only other thing I can think of trying is power cycling the switch whilst connected but I am not allowed to do that during office hours. Any ideas besides this?

                              <span>Hi community, 
 thanks for reading!
 I have an application running on a Windows Server with does not support any authentication at all. Therefore I build an IIS reverse proxy in front of it which is using Windows authentication. Everything worked fine until a new addon was installed to the application. Now, I am always sent back to the Windows authentication pop up when trying to open the addon page and gives me a 401 error although entering the right credentials. For me it looks like there is some kind of username / password coming with the link to the new module which kills my authentication.
 As soon as I change IIS from Windows authentication to Anonymous authentication it works.
 Here are the IIS logs (anonymized)

                              <span>So what I&#x27;m looking for is something that emulates the functionality of say MDT or FOG Project but that&#x27;s entirely mobile, can be run from bootable media/local storage and doesn&#x27;t require a server-side application that client devices have to interface with (preferably, the image files can be stored anywhere and then copied to storage media that is connected to the devices that require imaging).
 This would be used exclusively for imaging devices with Windows 10/11 Pro and customising the images to include the usual suite of client/environment specific additions: drivers, applications, Windows configuration, etc.
 The closest solution I can think of is NTLite but this product goes WAY back and I have no idea whether it&#x27;s at all relevant, well-supported, still works with Windows 11 and there are security concerns with tools like these given most of them are closed-source. Also, from what I can tell it&#x27;s exclusively an image-editing solution, so the imaging part of the process still has to be done manually via making bootable USB drives with Rufus for example. I don&#x27;t believe there are any similar solutions out there that can for example, image devices on the same network from a image repository stored on local storage?
 We have a number of clients with no on-prem server hardware that have fairly unique, extensively-customised OS images with a plethora of industry-specific software on top of that, and they are an absolute time-sink to reimage whenever one of their PCs/laptops is having issues and/or they purchase new hardware.

 /usr/lib64/nagios/plugins/check_centreon_nrpe -H X.X.X.X -p 5666 -t 120 -u -m 8192 -c check_centreon_plugins -a &#x27;apps::backup::veeam::local::plugin&#x27; &#x27;job-status&#x27; &#x27; --filter-name&#x3D;&quot;&quot; --filter-start-time&#x3D;&quot;&quot; --filter-end-time&#x3D;&quot;&quot; --filter-counters&#x3D;&quot;&quot; --ok-status&#x3D;&quot;&quot; --warning-status&#x3D;&quot;&quot; --critical-status&#x3D;&quot;&quot; --warning-long&#x3D;&quot;&quot; --critical-long&#x3D;&quot;&quot; &#x27;
 The result : 
 Status information CHECK_NRPE: Received 0 bytes from daemon. Check the remote server logs for error messages.
 The snmpwalk work from my poller to the vm. I can telnet the VM from the poller on the 5666 port.
 I tried looking on the web but i don&#x27;t find any solution directly related to centreon so i don&#x27;t find any good solution. Thanks you all.

                              <span>Good morning
 This is a real long shot, I&#x27;m at the end of all my support options! Banging my head against the wall because I am clearly missing something obvious.
 I have two ASAv&#x27;s in different locations, both with the same split tunneling setup. We have a internet based service that we use OKTA for Authentication and recently implemented a CA policy to restrict out bound networks from accessing.
 What we have discovered is that Location A seems to show OKTA our DC Public IP, Location B it see&#x27;s their personal public IP.
 If you have a corporate IP you are routed internally to an on-prem appliance to authenticate. This doesn&#x27;t happen in the other location, you are simply blocked.
 If my route of traffic is to an external internet based application surely OKTA wouldn&#x27;t see my corporate DC IP. So how on earth does it manage to?!
 Gosh please help, tried explaining this to OKTA and got nowhere,

                              <span>Hi all,
 Currently we have unifi in the uk, but across the rest of our sites in europe we are using meraki.
 In one of our uk sites we have 30 unifi access points and we plan to add another 10, however we would like to move to meraki eventually.
 If i put 10 meraki ap&#x27;s into the uk site and configure them the same as the unifi (ssid&#x27;s, vlans etc) will i have performance issues?
 we don&#x27;t have the budget to do a full lift and shift, so it would have to be staged if this will work.

                              <span>Been evaluating DMARC recently, and I couldn&#x27;t find much information to help guide me when comparing options. So I tried to write down my thoughts in a way I would have found useful. I hope someone on here gets a bit of value out of it.
 A few observations is that there is a huge disparity between bottom range vendors and top range vendors in terms of price, and that there is a corresponding disparity in terms of tool functionality and Trust-center maturity. Top tier vendors offer some cool functions, but the increase in price was hardly worth it.
 Common DMARC vendor problems
 Common problems among nearly all DMARC vendors we spoke to (with 1 exception) was that they all had a hard time giving us a fixed quote, claiming that they needed to run a PoC/Trial to analyze our volumes before bei…</span>

 I am trying to create a PS script that will ask for UNC path to a shared folder, and compare 2 users to extract which security group allows them access to it. 
 I dont really have much experience with PS, so i&#x27;ve turned to AI to help me write the scripts, but its not working properly. 
 For testing purposes i took location and 2 person for who i know how gain access to said location, but the scripts returns result that they are not members of the same group (Even when they are). 
 This is what i made so far: 
 # Prompt for shared folder location
 $sharedFolder &#x3D; Read-Host &quot;Enter the path of the shared folder (e.g., \\server\share):&quot;
 # Prompt for user emails
 $user1Email &#x3D; Read-Host &quot;Enter the email address of the first user:&quot;

                              <span>Hello,
 I am looking for free alternatives to Anydesk and Chrome remote desktop. Teamviewer says I should buy a license because I use it often. Anydesk is pretty robust but there is a noticeable lag, which I don&#x27;t see on Chrome remote desktop. Unfortunately, one of my computers is connected to an new network where I can connect only through proxy. Chrome remote desktop doesn&#x27;t have an option for proxy manipulation and changing it through the whole system didn&#x27;t work either. 
 I tried NoMachine but I kept getting problems with the proxy. I gave up since I saw a lot of negative reviews about being slow.

                              <span>Odd question but googling has left me with no answers. 
 We currently have O365 and force MFA on every account. Users have downloaded the Microsoft Authenticator app and have added name@companydomain.com to it. 
 Works just fine for logging into O365
 We are about to roll out MFA to the new payroll system but in testing when adding the account via QR code (name@companydomain.com is the login) a second account in the Authenticator is not created and now the onetime passcode that cycles for that account works in both O365 AND the payroll system. 
 How and why?
 If I force a re-registration on O365 it breaks the payroll MFA
 If the user deletes the account from the Authenticator and adds it back it breaks the payroll MFA.
 I would think the onetime code for O365 and payroll system would be different unless they are somehow communicating. 
 Side note: there’s ZERO integration between the two systems. One is managed and maintained by HR and the other is IT.

 Having issues with 802.1x crapping out so would downgrade from 09.0.10c to the recommended 08.0.95j release?

                              <span>So tonight, I just didn&#x27;t upgrade from a C3750x to a C9300 and I basically copied the config from the 3750 to the 9300, other then the trunk. Long story short the 9300 wasn&#x27;t about to find its way out of the network the core switch at the site could ping the 9300. They were directly connected via fiber. The 9300 didn&#x27;t work until I added a static route to the core switch. &quot;ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 &quot;core ip&quot; &quot;. My qestuon is why I do i need to add the default route when I already programmed a default gateway on the 9300. The 3750 has no issues with understand the exit point but 9300 needs that static route when it&#x27;s only a layer 2 device.

                              <span>I feel like I already know the answer to this question. I was having a discussion about design with one of my bosses and I think we are in a disagreement about security best practices and practicality of implementing this type of design. 
 I think its normal to have your data VLAN, voice VLAN, WiFi/Guest VLANs, IOT VLAN, server VLAN, and perhaps others as needed. I also think its normal for a lot, if not all, of this traffic to hairpin to the local firewall. This may add a very slight amount of latency, but its worth it because of the added security letting the firewall inspect, monitor, and log traffic. 
 I think we have fundamental disagreements about network designs. I think hed prefer everything to be as flat as possible, but that is extremely messy. And makes troubleshooting difficult sometimes. As well as implementing changes on the fly. If data and phones are on the same subnet, you can run into QoS issues if you just start throwing on SSL inspection. 
 Anyways, my point is this type of design should not be considered &quot;over-engineered&quot; for even a small to medium sized business. MAYBE a mom/pop shop with 10 employees, a DC, a file server, and a couple printers its overkill. But, otherwise as you start to grow you NEED to take these things into a consideration otherwise it becomes a mess.

                              <span>Curious on everyones perspective for this. 
 Do you filter what your guest network has access to via Web/URL filtering,, DNS, IPS, App, etc?
 Do you throttle it?
 Do you give it a local DNS server to reference?
 Fire away!

 Compare that with a hot skill like kubernetes. Idk, any money in learning this stuff? 
 Hope you folks can share your experiences.

                              <span>Hi, sooo, yesterday I got burned really really badly on a Palo Alto pair that I&#x27;m migrating traffic across to. Long story short, it was a mistake my end, I had a NAT rule where I wanted it to NAT to the interface address of the outside interface and I had it built like this....
 Original Packet: Src Zone: Inside Dst Zone: Outside Dst Int: e1/1 Scr Address: entire 10/8 range Dst address: any
 Translated Packet: Src Translation: dynamic-ip-and-port Address-object for outside interface IP Dst address Translation: any
 The problem was, the address-object on the translated packet was what is on the outside interface, including the subnet mask of a /28!! Which royally messed everything up! I&#x27;m guessing that it was proxy-arping out for all the addresses in that range/subnet and it ended up killing our current live outbound firewalls!
 What I SHOULD have done is have another address-object that was the same address but on a /32, is that right? That&#x27;s what I have now, but holy fuck am I scared to switch it back on! Even when going through a change!
 I noticed you can set it to translate to the interface address, interface and IP Address as well? Would this do the same as above when I mentioned about what I should&#x27;ve done instead?
 The PA NAT is definitely a different concept when coming from an ASA and Firepower world! And I lost a lot of confidence and have been pretty hard on myself ever since that happened yesterday and not seeing that!
 Would I be alright doing either of the 2 revised ways mentioned?
 The reason why I switched this particular NAT rule on was that its meant to be a catch all for PAT to the interface address, we have a large routed range that is natted to specific public IP&#x27;s and they&#x27;re currently live on the ASA&#x27;s, so I can&#x27;t enable those specific ones on the PA&#x27;s yet, so I needed a way to get the outside interface working to test a few VM&#x27;s in one of the lower end environments

                              <span>I am trying to set up a lab on Eve-Ng to learn Network Automation with Ansible.
 I already have a Linux Server with Ubuntu image and can ping to the routers with the Cisco Vios image.
 The issue is that I am getting this error, % Unrecognized command
 when trying to run
 R1(config)#crypto key generate rsa modulus
 However, this is a recognized command on the Cisco Vios or the switch but not the router image.
 Is this an issue with Cisco vios image (vios-adventerprisek9-m.spa.159-3)?
 Is there another Cisco router image that is recommended to enable ssh?
 Thank you ! Any help is appreciated!!

                              <span>On an existing Cisco BGP configuration I want to add a new BGP peer as backup and remove an old one:
 router bgp 54321 bgp router-id 9.9.9.9 neighbor 50.50.50.50 remote-as 7777 neighbor 50.50.50.50 description peer1 neighbor 68.68.68.68 remote-as 7777 neighbor 68.68.68.68 description peer2 neighbor 68.68.68.68 ebgp-multihop 255 ! address-family ipv4 network 9.9.9.0 neighbor 50.50.50.50 activate neighbor 50.50.50.50 weight 300 neighbor 50.50.50.50 prefix-list default-route in neighbor 50.50.50.50 prefix-list ARIN-BLOCK out neighbor 68.68.68.68 activate neighbor 68.68.68.68 weight 100 neighbor 68.68.68.68 prefix-list default-route in neighbor 68.68.68.68 prefix-list deny-all out exit-address-family ! ip prefix-list ARIN-BLOCK seq 5 permit 9.9.9.0/24 ! ip prefix-list default-route seq 5 permit 0.0.0.0/0 ! ip prefix-list deny-all seq 5 deny 0.0.0.0/0 
 Removing 68.68.68.68 and adding 12.12.12.12 it would look something like this:
 router bgp 54321 bgp router-id 9.9.9.9 neighbor 50.50.50.50 remote-as 7777 neighbor 50.50.50.50 description peer1 neighbor 12.12.12.12 remote-as 7777 neighbor 12.12.12.12 description peer2 ! address-family ipv4 network 9.9.9.0 neighbor 50.50.50.50 activate neighbor 50.50.50.50 weight 300 neighbor 50.50.50.50 prefix-list default-route in neighbor 50.50.50.50 prefix-list ARIN-BLOCK out neighbor 12.12.12.12 activate neighbor 12.12.12.12 weight 200 neighbor 12.12.12.12 prefix-list default-route in neighbor 12.12.12.12 prefix-list deny-all out exit-address-family 
 Questions: 
 Why does only the primary peer has &quot;prefix-list ARIN-BLOCK out&quot; is this a misconfiguration on the original setup that missed the advertised block on the secondary peer?
 Same question for &quot;prefix-list deny-all out&quot; on the backup peer
 Shouldn&#x27;t both neighbors have the same config except for weight (300 for primary)?
 EDIT Forgot to add, the new peer is directly connected and shouldn&#x27;t need multihop so I removed that line

                              <span>My office was destroyed by a tornado and I need to rebuild the network infrastructure. a brother of mine that is new to cybersecurity is proposing that I use a PfSense firewall. With Unifi switches and AP&#x27;s. We used to have old cisco switches with a pix firewall.
 Another direction I am being pushed toward is using a Cisco ASA with &quot;Cisco Business&quot; switches.
 For unifi I am concerned about the ability to properly segment the network especially if Layer 3 functionality is required.
 We will need separation for a few things.
  
Keycard entry/door controller. This will only want internet when updates are necessary.
 Security camera VLAN for cameras and DVR.
 VLAN for Employee PCs Laptops Phones.
 Guest VLAN for Guest Wifi
 Possibly an IOT VLAN? (if not placed on the other guest network.) for the Thermostats, Ring Devices Etc.
  
Will Ubiquity/Unifi be able to handle this and keep it secure? Anything I should be concerned about or aware of?

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 Deep (quick?) question! I’m trying to size servers to host a network monitoring solution and I need to « guestimate » how many sessions per second (on average) you can see going through a 10GBit/s (RX/TX &#x3D; both direction between two IP addresses, whatever the protocols over that) in an ISP network, a small Data Center network and the network of a Large Enterprise. I know it heavily depends on how many equipments are behind those, but… 🤷🏻‍♂️ - I’m starving for real life data ;-)
 And I know every network is different, but that would help me a lot if you could quote average and peak usages for those kind of networks you might have seen on 10G or even a 25G or 40G network (both North-South and East-West). 
 I looked at research papers, but… I just couldn’t find anything useful. Sometimes I find data on flows per second… but that’s not the same thing and extrapolating numbers isn’t really easy. 
 Can someone (or several someone) help me out on this one or point me to the right direction/ressource?

Since CEF is Cisco proprietary, I&#x27;m curious if other brands have their own proprietary forwarding protocols, or if it&#x27;s gone a similar route to EIGRP and OSPF, where the other brands use pretty much the same forwarding protocols.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 i&#x27;m having some doubts about configuring QoS on a Nexus3000 C3064PQ with NX-OS 7.x 
 I have two SVI, A and B
 A is my WAN, B is my LAN Gateway (with HSRP)
 A is allowed on Po100 which is the vPC used as WAN 
 I need to configure shape average only on WAN side (will it be via ACL on Po100, or via the whole SVI A, for my duties, is the same), but I find it difficult to understand which is the right way to do so, I&#x27;ve found controversial info in this field, and I&#x27;ll try to resume it to those 2 solutions: 
 Solution 1: Apply global policies and then apply a more specific on Po100

                              <span>Hi guys,
 We are in a such situation that Aruba TAC basically made everything worse so far.
 We have a customer case that made bracnch users to can&#x27;t take IP from DC.
 Long story short, I saw there is L2 tunnels between branch and DC clusters. Since the team that commissioned this have no idea about loops, cluster *tunnels* had no redundancy, and one branch cluster member at a time can&#x27;t connect to DC.
 TAC made tunnel redundancy with full mesh tunnels. No VRRP used anywhere. The problem is since SSID VLAN connected to same L2 domain, network has now big problem, loop.
 I&#x27;m looking for solution, since branch load balancing has no issues so far, and SSID not bridge on branch, we need solution for DC side.
 What do you think about ,we should use Aruba tunnel groups, Branch primary tunnels goes to physical address of first DC cluste member and secondary goes to second cluster member.
 Or
 We just use VRRP for branch destination and DC source. I saw a Airheads post about VRRP standby never use this tunnel unless VRRP active realy goes down. So far no loops.
 Any help would be appreciated

 ​
 These devices are constantly on the network sending out information to an application. At one of the facilities, the device stopped sending info. So of course we get called. We cannot ping it, can&#x27;t access the web interface, nothing. The screen on the device itself is still showing good info, it&#x27;s just not sending it over the network anymore. We get the person on-site to reboot it and it came back up.

 Well then it started happening more and more. This facility is a LONG way from the central office and this now malfunctioning device is quite important. We sent someone on site with a fluke to certify the runs…</span>

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m in the middle of a migration to 2 pairs of 3220&#x27;s, one pair for outbound and another for hosted.
 I&#x27;ve created the necessary layer 7 profiles, my question is, what and where would be the best places to apply them?
 At the moment, I&#x27;m thinking about putting only the URL based ones on outbound &quot;any&quot; rules and leaving the Anti Virus, Spyware and Vulnerability profiles off since logically they&#x27;re only really meant for inbound attacks? I guess you could make a case for potential filed that are downloaded and thus the Anti Virus profile would be useful then. Initially I did think about apply all 4 mentioned above there to &quot;any&quot; rules and have the same 3 applied to any rules coming in on the hosted firewalls.
 What are generally, the best ways to do it in everyone&#x27;s opinion?
 Thanks

 Then after we hit submit error: &quot;Failed to save configuration Integration encountered an error. Unalbe to authenticate with provided administrator credentials. Check the destination and credentials and try again.&quot;
 Problem is, I don&#x27;t know where the error is... NNMI creds, logger host info, or logger creds? I have tried multiple credentials that have admin rights and again, I can login to each of these components themselves using the credentials.

                              <span>Hello I have a quick question about NTP. 
 I have a router set up t get time from and upstream router ad they are sync&#x27;d up at a Stratum 2. 
 I am trying to get all my servers below my router to point to my router as their time source. Would I need to have the &quot;ntp master&quot; command in my router so the servers will be able to get the time from my router?
 ​
 This is a Cisco shop with Windows 2019 servers
 I have the ntp keys and the servers configured on my router as well as the ntp source which is my loopback0 interface. and when I run a show ntp status and associations I see that we are sync&#x27;d with the servers. I just need the Windows servers to get their time from my router.

 Anyway, these are the pages I mainly got my information from:
 https://docs.nvidia.com/networking/display/MLNXOFEDv471001/OVS+Offload+Using+ASAP2+Direct
 https://infohub.delltechnologies.com/l/architecture-guide-ready-architecture-for-red-hat-openstack-platform-version-16-1-flex-2/sr-iov-ovs-hardware-offload-with-vf-lag
 ​
 My understanding is: VF LAG means two physical ports / physical functions on a card are getting bonded. And then virtual functions of that bonded interface are passed through to VMs.
 And using SR-IOV, the kernel offloads that stuff to the NIC.
 Is my understanding correct?

                              <span>Is anyone else seeing a recent trend of Dell&#x27;s laptops (Precision 5x and XPS devices) coming with fingerprints on the plastic wrap, laptop and dirt or fragments of what seems to be shavings from the keyboard and other components in the box? I&#x27;m all for adding a little spice to the machines but you would have thought being such an expensive device ($3-5k AUD EACH) that they&#x27;d at least clean them before sending them out.
 Just wondering whether this is us (Sydney, Australia) or whether we&#x27;ve been feeding down from a bad batch of machines for the last 6mo. We&#x27;re about to start direct-to-user&#x27;ing them with Autopilot and it doesn&#x27;t exactly make it feel like a great experience. Never had this issue with any other vendor.
 EDIT: pictures of one we received this morning - you&#x27;ll note the device hasn&#x27;t been taken out of the plastic wrapper yet

Given that all event logs trace back to the &#x27;SYSTEM&#x27; account, are there alternate methods to ascertain the origin and purpose of this account?

 Do you think there will be better communication now about new employees and leavers? :D

https://www.reddit.com/r/Save3rdPartyApps/comments/13yh0jf/dont_let_reddit_kill_3rd_party_apps/
  
Background: Reddit is starting to charge for their API, which means that open-source reddit clients will likely cease to function next month.
 In response, hundreds of subreddits are going dark to remind Reddit that their website is only as valuable as their user&#x27;s content. And the users want to be able to use open-source apps.
 Can /r/sysadmin join this protest by going dark for 48 hours, starting on June 12th?
 Edit While this subreddit is dark, users can still share and read about critical outages on /c/sysadmin on lemmy as a backup/alternative in the fediverse.

                              <span>So apparently SendGrid started enforcing TLS 1.2 on all emails into their API on 6/5/23. I heard about our clients not receiving emails and chased it down to our powershell script invoking the API needing this new line.
 [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol &#x3D; [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
 This forces powershell to use TLS 1.2 and everything works fine again.
 Just thought I&#x27;d share in case your sendgrid emails aren&#x27;t working - that&#x27;s likely the culprit!
 Cheers!

                              <span>So I’ve been in an IT manager role for 2 months now. I’ve noticed that as a company we tend not to be very innovative and stuck in old ways. We’re scared to try new technologies, because I’m told this is always how it’s been done. Hell, we don’t even warranty devices…. Does anyone have thoughts from a sysadmin viewpoint, on how to encourage higher ups to allow me and other to use newer technology and trends?

                              <span>We&#x27;re looking to put in a monitor for simple up/down/availability on our monitoring server. Since this is intended to let us know if the monitoring server becomes unavailable, we want something cloud hosted, ideally with an agent-based checkin from the node to the cloud service (we don&#x27;t want to open the server up to external polling).
 We&#x27;re not looking to monitor more than that node so we&#x27;re essentially looking for a service that is happy to provide service for a single node.
 Does anyone have any suggestions on vendors we could take a look at?

 And I’ve never been on a call where a software engineer has had to join.
 Currently have a situation where a software product out company sells to customers is straight up not working and customers are so angry they are threatening to quit. Software people seem to only have to work their usual hours and don’t even seem concerned with the issue.

 There are no &quot;unused&quot; domains that are available, all domains in question have had previous owners. Can this affect deliverability? What if the previous domain owner used it to broadcast spam?
 ​
 I myself don&#x27;t send any unsolicited (or even solicited) marketing emails. We basically only respond to customer inquiries within minutes or days at latest. In other words, almost none of our outgoing mail is not a response to an earlier, incoming mail from the corresponding sender.
 However, since it&#x27;s a support email address, delivery is very very important so we don&#x27;t want to risk hitting a spam folder with customers then complaining that they haven&#x27;t received a response yet

 $4900 for 16 GB memory, 512 GB storage, Xeon processor half as fast as 13600, and a gpu less powerful as 3080? Am I missing something about the professional workstation market?

                              <span>Hi all, probably a dumb question but I just can’t figure it out, and I’ve googled…I’ve been tasked with setting up a two-node Windows Server file share cluster. But I can’t for the life of me figure out how to create a iSCSI disk to expose in the Virtual Machine Manager Fabric. 
 My idea now is to just add a simple volume to a VM and installed the iSCSI target role on it. Any better ideas for those of you who have worked with this before?

 Have been enabling bitlocker for one of our clients, have been doing it manually per machine as the client (rightly) doesn&#x27;t want to buy an Intune license just to manage this.
 Have got the keys saved in a secure location, but having checked both in the tenant Azure and the actual users My Devices section, I can&#x27;t see the key in there, although this has all been within the last 5 mins to be fair.
 The real question I suppose; does the client now require an Intune license in order for 365 to store Bitlocker keys?

                              <span>We just had an outage in work [UK] where both our backup and main line went out. This has never happened before (had outages on one or t&#x27;other before), but I see news about hacks / outages with increasing regularity. 
 This Week ;Last Month
 Anyone else experiencing this, and am I being paranoid in thinking this is Russian hacking/DDoS?

                              <span>We have a small office of about 10 users. No servers or complicated environment. Microsoft 365 shop with user data in OneDrive and SharePoint. No need to connect to the office via VPN.
 For a few years we used Ubiquiti EdgeRouter, the router was performing fine, but it stopped working and we need to replace it and we have a choice of going with another EdgeRouter or replacing it with either Sonicwall or FortiGate. 
 Our endpoints all have SentinelOne.
 For our environment, what would you recommend?

                              <span>Hi,
 in my company there is the need for several users (operators) to use a single machine, so we created service account with the accountability of head of deparment. 
 But there is the need for that account to write to file server. H i see 2 problems here:
  
Accountability for service account that access to file server. 
 The machine is running h24, there is a way to manage password expire for the service account in file server? The need is to write h24 to file server.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to persuade my boss to quote customers for more hours for a server migration.
 What typically do you charge for a server migration (currently quoting 5 hours):
  
On prem to Azure AD virtual service
 AD migration (20 users)
 Group policy migration (nothing complicated)
 Data migration 1TB (noting complicated)
 Printers
  
Thanks

 I´m concerned by the use of ChatGPT in my organizations. We have been discussing blocking ChatGPT on our network to prevent users from feeding the Chatbot with sensitive company information. 
 I´m more for not blocking the website and educate our colleagues instead. We can´t prevent them for not accessing the website at home and feed the Chatbot with information. 
 ​
 What are your thoughts on this?

                              <span>Hi there i received a project of making 25PCs boot through network from my lecturer at collage
 I have experience setting DHCP servers before but have never done anything like this before so any resources and guidance or alternative solutions would be helpful 
 I was planning to use ISCSI following directions in the below video but in the comments it said that only 1 client can boot at a time 
 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;_elwqBKIlLI
 The link below says that using ISCSI it can diskless boot multiple client but i cant find any resources or guides on this
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/iscsi/iscsi-target-server
 The goal is to have the clients boot up with a fresh preconfigd os with preinstalled applications every restart 
 Im currently looking at ccboot or dds+ but of course ill look elsewhere first since i need to pay for it
 The server is a HP proliant dl380p gen8 The PCs is a mix of models from HP &amp; DELL 
 Sorry if my grammar is bad english is not my first language

 Supplier suggeted the 345-BEFN 
 Dell suggested the 480GB SSD SATA Mixed Use 6Gbps 512e 2.5in w/3.5in Brkt AG, Cabled which looks similar 
 ​
 But those both come in brackets that look like they wouldnt fit the t150. Does anybody have any suggetions? Or would something like a Kingston Data Center DC500M work as well?

 What is the best practices on DNS Application Policy in Cisco Umbrella DNS. 
  
Thank you so much.

                              <span>Hi fellow sysadmins. We are currently discussing allowing/using ChatGPT or other natural language processing tools in our company. I see that some of you already use it. How do you use it? Any providers you use? 
 Did you do an information security risk assessment? Any other implications on security that we would need to be aware of?
 Would love to hear your experiences.

                              <span>Hi all, 
 I was wondering who of you got some good software approval requests processes? Maybe ITIL compliant, maybe not?
 I find the process hard, as there are many factors, costs/cybersecurity/the technical pull for maintenance etc. 
 We do have a good process for big systems, such as CRM etc. but for the smaller ones, time and attendance, task management, plug-ins etc. are a bit complex to handle and results in long approval times for the users, and a lot of no&#x27;s.
 I was thinking about a software technology board, and to try to shift as much decision power left in the process so the first evaluator can make 90% of the decisions, but I would appreciate if any of you want to share your experiences?
 We are a global company with 800 users.

 Can anyone recommend a good Office 365 SAAS backup solution that provides protection for exchange, SharePoint, Teams and OneDrive. Preferably with cost per month.

                              <span>Is it just me or for the past 1-2 years software is becoming less and less reliable ?
 I feel like a lot of &quot;stable release&quot; software is starting to behave a lot like beta software and basic functionality is thrown under the tracks just to push out unnecessary updates.
 I was thinking this is was just in gaming, a model where you release a broken piece of software that is somewhat usable only after 6 months of updates but you get your money because people are... people... but I start seeing it in a lot of software nowadays that gets a major update that breaks it for months (looking at you HP and DELL).
 From broken video (dear intel choke on broken always-on dynamic contrast) and audio drivers (waves choke on that out-of-a-barrel-echo) on 1000$ laptops to BIOS settings that don&#x27;t work properly ??? And crashes in software that was very reliable years ago from big companies like Cisco and Adobe.
 What the hell is going on here ?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never met a sysadmin who actually wanted cold-calls from vendors. I&#x27;ve gotten plenty of (targeted) spam emails and calls, including to my personal cell (last one was from ADP... really? really?). I&#x27;m sure y&#x27;all get them too. Some of them even say &quot;I got your details from LinkedIn&quot; but they&#x27;re using details that LinkedIn never had. They&#x27;re likely getting your info from one of the big B2B services out there. So I went and compiled a quick list of 11 of the largest B2B databases, with the links to their opt-out/delete pages. 
 This is especially useful if you&#x27;re in CA, but should at least work if you&#x27;re in the US or EU. All of them will require your (business) email and some other details to process the request, and some are more solid than others. It&#x27;s also a good idea (if possible) to see what they have on you before requesting the delete -- that&#x27;s how I found one of them that had my personal cell # attached.

 my company is in a need of an e-mail archiving solution and I do not know any programs that are specialized for this. We work on projects which require us to have e-mails saved for legal purposes. The solution should be integrated in Outlook, offer some kind of search engine to find the e-mails easily.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Was tasked with building out a new HQ site and was curious as to what folks on here would choose for hardware options if they had the opportunity to greenfield something. I have been a staunch supporter of Arista in the datacenter but the 720 series just don&#x27;t seem to make sense from a price to performance perspective (7 - 10k for a 24port POE switch...) . I really like Juniper&#x27;s EX switches and the mist APs have been solid when I have deployed them in the past. However I am already deploying Fortinet / FortiAPs at other locations. I ideally wanted to avoid Cisco and have no experience with Aruba. I was thinking a mix of FortiGate FW \ AP&#x27;s and Juniper Switches (POE and Access) would probably work but would be curious to hear what other folks would opt for and why. Lets say for this exercise the site is 25k sqft over 4 floors with a comms room on each with structured caballing between comms rooms and to the floor ports. Cable runs for the AP&#x27;s are already done. The Site will host about 100 - 150 users at peak. All you have to do is choose the hardware configure \ install and manage it. Oh I suppose for external connectivity you could have dual DIA at the site with SD-WAN or P2P circuits to local DC locations if that makes any difference. 
 ​
  
Switches - Juniper EX (POE)
 Firewall - FortiGate 100 or 200f HA
 
Wireless (APs and Controller if required) - FAP-231G (FortiGate as the controller)

                              <span>I am in the planning stage of setting up a small new publically routable network, and I wanted to ask if anyone had any experiance requesting IP addresses under policy 4.10, which allows for IPv4 allocations for IPv6 transition purposes like NAT464 servers, dual-stack dns and the like. I am planning for the network to be primarily if not exclusivly tv6, but I am still looking to maintian compatiblity with v4 devices, so it looks like this might be a good fit for me. Before I began applying however, I wanted to see what other&#x27;s experiances have been and what sort of documentation I should have on hand ahead of time.

                              <span>Sorry for the beginner question, pretty inexperienced with certificates.
 We&#x27;re using PKI/ NDES and Intune/ SCEP. This is set up and user/ machine certificates are flowing to the clients just fine. The user authentication is working fine as well. The issue I&#x27;m seeing is machine authentication failing on the login screen. Our NAC (ClearPass) is stating the object cannot be found in the identity store (local AD), which makes sense.
 Is this configuration possible? What would need to be adjusted to make this work?

They have a threshold of 1% packet loss and 5 out of 6 locations they tested had 0.89% packet loss and only one had 1.33% packet loss. Due to that 1.33% they recommended we do qos end to end to mitigate that.
 My question is what will qos do if the locations they tested against has low bandwidth usage about 20-30% usage and no signs of congestion.

                              <span>We&#x27;re using TEAP for wireless authentication and I&#x27;m starting to pilot the same for wired. I&#x27;m running into a weird issue for just my machine so far, where it will send my computer certificate but not user. The deployed GPO is basically the same as wireless which works fine and is the same as other machines/users that also work fine, on the same switch (9300L) to the same ISE nodes (2.7) and machines are running Windows 10 22H2. 
 Windows event logs don&#x27;t show any errors, but I can confirm with a pcap on the workstation that only the machine cert ever leaves it.
 I cannot for the life of me figure out why I can&#x27;t get it to send my user cert only over wired.

 Does anyone have experience building a S2S tunnel over an ExpressRoute with a pre-existing S2S, over the internet, already in place? Azure docs are specifying that I need to construct a VPN GW with a Public IP address and then &quot;convert&quot; it to private IP addressing to be used as the IPsec tunnel endpoint over the ER. 
 Does that make sense to anyone?

                              <span>I am new to NetScout. Can someone explain to me the differences between these Port class: Span, Monitor, Span-Monitor, Service, pStack, Inline Network and Inline Monitor? 
 I know what a Span port does but not the rest of the others.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hey there,
 I have recently started taken on additional responsiblity someone who is a co-administrator for a Zabbix monitoring solution. 
 Right now I have run into a wall and I dont entirely know how to solve it, ive tried google, looking up the MIB with google, infact ive wasted the last six hours on this and I need some advice.
 We have a bunch of Juniper SRX 320 routers using VDSL Cards running JUNOS 21.3R1.9 .
 Now I am trying to pull both Bit rate values from the VDSL card using interface pt-1/0/0
 &gt; show interfaces extensive pt-1/0/0 | match bit
 Bit rate (kbps) : 79999 0 20000 0
 The ifIndex of the interface is 539 and running an MIB walk I was able to identify the MIB that corresponds to the 20000 value (the upload speed)
 &gt;show snmp mib walk 1 | match 539
 ifIndex.539 &#x3D; 539
 ifDescr.539 &#x3D; pt-1/0/0
 ifType.539 &#x3D; 97
 ifMtu.539 &#x3D; 1492
 ifSpeed.539 &#x3D; 20000000
 ifPhysAddress
 ifAdminStatus.539 &#x3D; 1
 ifOperStatus.539 &#x3D; 1
 ifLastChange.539 &#x3D; 17347
 ifInOctets.539 &#x3D; 29758270
 ifInUcastPkts.539 &#x3D; 495971
 +900 more lines ive gone through.
 ifSpeed.539 &#x3D; 20000000 - This is the value that is the upload speed of interface pt-1/0/0 and I Was able to get the OID (1.3.6.1.2.1.2.2.1.5.539) and pull it into our Zabbix 6 instance and its monitoring it just fine. 
 But I am HARD stuck at finding the MIB / OID corresponding to the value 79999 so I can also track the Download speed. I can not seem to find it anywhere. If I run an SNMP walk for that value it turns up nothing. I feel like im missing something and im now at bash head against wall territory so if I could get ANY advice that would be great.

At my work, I typically search for any networking terms or concepts that I am not aware of and most of the time, I come across the website Network Lessons. Material is good and informative. Is it worth the subscription or $390/Year? I already have INE subscription which I use for video courses.

                              <span>Hello!
 I found that if I run iperf3 with option &quot;-bidir&quot; it lost about 50%(from 40% till 53%) of packets. 
 iperf3 -c 10.96.140.101 --udp -b 100m -bidir 
 If I remove &quot;-bidir&quot; it lost 0.5% 
 I believe it&#x27;s correct behavior, it&#x27;s verified new infrastructure, but I can&#x27;t explain to myself why. 
 Any thoughts, why that happens?

                              <span>We have an existing data center. All cabling is home run and bundled, dressed and tidy. 
 Occasionally, we get issues that crop up. Sometimes it’s a SPF issue, sometimes a port issue on a device. Rarely is the issue a cable. 
 But I’d like to be able to independently and confidently be able to test a cable and rule that out when issues come up. 
 I know Fluke testers are the industry standard. But they have them ranging from a lot of money up to a ton of money. I don’t know what I need. 
 Can someone lay out the options and benefits/shortcomings of what I need for occasional troubleshooting? I don’t see this as on par with needs of an installer who has to certify multiple runs at once with cable serial number printouts. But testing here and there is more likely the use case.

We want to see if we have enough compute power to support more than a few of our customers at once making a video call. How do I do it and where do I start? I&#x27;ve tried googling and working with Zabbix and I can&#x27;t seem to figure it out. Thank you!

                              <span>Hi,
 ​
 I have a 3750 connected to a 9300 and it&#x27;s capping out at ~300mbps, with inconsistent speeds overall on iPerf.
 ​
 There are not policies on either switch. Both endpoint ports are on the same vlan and communication works fine, just the bandwidth is poor.
 ​
 I have updated both the 9300 and 3750 to the latest ios yet this hasn&#x27;t fixed it.
 ​
 ​
 Does anyone have any ideas what it could be? (I cannot get rid of the 9300 at the moment)

                              <span>I was put in charge on updating our monitoring software and and I noticed that VLANs and Service Instances bandwidth usage can&#x27;t be measured becase they don&#x27;t have a valid ODI/MIB.
 What I also noticed that if a Service Instance is inside a port-channel or a bundle-ethernet they suddenly can be monitored, is this correct?
 So, correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, if I REALLY wanted to monitor those service instances I can configure a port-channel with only 1 physical interface and I could get it working?
 FYI all of this is on a few ASR920 Cisco routers.
 How dumb is this? Is there a better way to do this?

 ​
 When I want to remove this VLAN from trk11, I run the following:
 Swi# conf t
 Swi(config)# interface trk11
 Swi(eth-Trk11)# no vlan 1120
 Swi(eth-Trk11)# exit
 ​
 HOWEVER, running this removed the VLAN from every LACP Trunk and every interface! Why does this happen? Using Aruba j9850a

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been on some networking assignments lately that could really benefit from the ability to detect what IP settings a particular switch is using. We have one netool.io at work, but it&#x27;s still in the grasp of another coworker. I&#x27;m wondering if I can potentially get the same performance from various Linux/Windows applications as I could from a netool.io. 
 Basically, I would just like to be able to plug into a switch cold and figure out what net address/subnet/vlans/etc. are currently configured. nmap and netstat are useful, but I haven&#x27;t been able to reliably log into a switch in a timely manner yet. 
 I&#x27;ll be heading back to Google shortly, but are there any online sources that explain specifically what netool.io and PockEthernet do? As I previously stated, it&#x27;d be really nice if I could just equip my laptop (or, ideally, my Samsung phone) with the tools necessary to perform the same function. 
 Any other ideas/reading/etc. for performing these sorts of tasks are also appreciated. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Good afternoon! I have such a task - there are several offices in which pfSense, Zyxel USG, Mikrotik, etc. are installed. And there is a VPS with pfSense without a LAN network - only WAN. I need to combine office networks via IPsec so that they can see each other, but with a centralized connection via VPS with pfSense (this is a prerequisite). The problem is that the old Zyxel routers do not support either Routed IPsec or OpenVPN, so you need to use only IPsec.
 I don&#x27;t understand how to configure IPsec on pfSense VPS without a LAN network, and what Phase2 policies to prescribe so that office networks can see each other.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know if this is just me, but for the life of me, I can&#x27;t figure out these damn Microsoft Surfaces and their inability to work with preinstallation environments. I&#x27;ve tried every combo of BIOS settings for them (disabling secure boot, etc..). Formatted both in NTFS and ExFat
 Try to boot using Hiren Boot CD? It loads the first frame, but you can&#x27;t move or select anything
 Try to boot using Windows Media Created USBs, freezes on the first screen
 Try to boot using Windows PE to build a new image, it gets stuck at wpeinit (Initializing). Can&#x27;t go any further.
 I did confirm it can boot to other situations like a Ubuntu .iso. So I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s the USB file system.
 The laptops in particular are Surfaces 4 and 5 and probably other models. Does anyone have a good idea of what&#x27;s going on here? I can&#x27;t figure it out from my coworkers, nor the internet.

                              <span>Someone sent an email to several of our users. Email was pretending to be the owner of the company, and asking them to reply. All of them were outside salespeople, using their mobile phones with Outlook. So, they saw the name and not the email address so they responded. Then, and this is the new one for me,they received a text message asking them to call him. Their outbound email signature includes their cellphone number, but two of the salespeople who got the text message had not replied to the email.
 They all quickly figured out it was not the owner, so nothing bad happened. What bothers me, other than the contact list leak, is the text messages. A bot campaign sending out phishing emails is not unusual. But, sending text messages is a new one.
 Anyone seen this before?

                              <span>So the title basically tells the whole story. This morning I received an alert by Computrace/Absolute that a device had been tampered with. By company policy, I froze the device and made a report. I come to find out that our newly hired Developer (3 weeks into the job) had attempted to deactivate our encryption software and was looking to steal our device. I am completely baffled at this and beg to question, Why!? Has anyone had an experience like this with a new hire who had tried to rip off the company and then just leave??
 Edit: For those asking, he quit almost immediately after his device was frozen and is refusing to return the device.

                              <span>&quot;Have you tried turning it off and on?&quot; is a common thing IT guys get made fun of for saying, but I mean we kind of deserve it. If it works, use it! I think it&#x27;s funny that other professions ALSO turn it off and back on, they just don&#x27;t want to call it that. Like once my mechanic told me to fix an issue with my car we needed to unplug the battery for an hour and then hook it back up. I said &quot;So ... turn it off and turn it back on?&quot; and he was like &quot;no, no, not like a computer&quot; and I just said &quot;suuuure.&quot;
 Well this weekend I learned a new one. Saturday evening my heart started racing for no reason. I put on my wife&#x27;s FitBit and my heart rate was 124, well over the 80 it should have been. I ended up in the ER, and told me my heart was in AFib. Normally when you heart beats, the top part of your heart beats first, then the bottom part beats. In AFib the top part of your heart doesn&#x27;t beat, it just kind of flutters. For me this meant the bottom part was beating much faster to try and compenstate. 
 I had to have a procedure, and the doctor described it as &quot;We are going to put a tube down your throat to get a better view of your heart, then we are going to give you a drug that will stop your heart for a moment, then we will shock your heart to get it started again, and it should start beating normally.&quot; I said &quot;So... turn it off and turn it back on?&quot; He didn&#x27;t know what to say so I said &quot;It&#x27;s ok, I am very familar with this process.&quot; 
 So there you have it fellow nerds. There is nothing that can&#x27;t be fixed without turning it off and turning it back on.
 (FYI, the procedure went well and my heart is back to normal. Also I ordered a smart watch that can detect AFib.)

                              <span>I always kind of looked down on people who got pushed out of their jobs because I figured there must be something wrong with them.
 Meanwhile I was always kicking ass. I was with the same company 15 years, kept getting promoted, always had glowing performance reviews. Got to the point where i was head of my unit and was reporting to a VP. He was always kind of an ass, and also a bootlicker, and was a pain in the ass to work for, but we made it work.
 We got a new division president and he seemed ok, but for some reason this guy wanted nothing to do with me when normally I should have been someone who met with him occasionally.
 About 6 months later, after another glowing performance review, the VP I work for tells me they&#x27;re posting my job but with a more senior title, and he said I was we…</span>

                              <span>Thought I&#x27;d share my hassle with you all in case it helps someone else.
 I have Barracuda Firewalls in Azure VMs and today everything behind that firewall just failed.
 After hours spent on the phone with support. it turns out there was geo update that labeled a certain ip address as coming from Hong Kong. this was an incorrect update. And if you are like my business and block all traffic from certain regions (in this case Hong Kong) then good luck getting in. for the longest time we were scratching our heads as our firewalls appeared functional and fine yet the only way we could communicate with them was through the azure serial console.
 ​
 Solution
 We created an outside VM in our azure environment that we could run the barracuda admin console on and thus make the corrections and exempt the IP address.
 ​
 Barracuda literally learned about this as we called. so, if you call you may have a smaller wait time than I did. thought I&#x27;d share the knowledge in case anyone needed it.

                              <span>Wow, Datadog&#x27;s sales are getting aggressive. Anyone else experiencing this?
 I keep getting calls from Datadog on my personal phone. They must have scraped it from the web. It&#x27;s pretty obvious I&#x27;m being targeted due to my title. Nobody else at my company is getting these calls. I never requested any info from them either.
 I&#x27;ve already told them we use a different stack and aren&#x27;t interested in changing. Datadog is WAY too expensive for us already and I&#x27;ve read enough billing issues and &quot;getting bit by the dog&quot; posts on this subreddit dealing with DD on top of that.
 I mentioned that there is one monitoring element I haven&#x27;t found solution for (big mistake). I work in the robotics industry so I threw him a question about if they had solutions for ROS monitoring. He said no. Ok so I tell him I&#x27;m not interested and hang up.
 Two weeks later I get an email from the DD sales guy saying he discussed my needs with a developer and wanted to see if i was interested in what they came up with. They basically began trying to sell me on software that was hacked together after 2 weeks and wasn&#x27;t even listed on their website. I&#x27;m good. No thanks.
 Months. no more calls. Ah peace.
 Today. The cycle has started again. Maybe a new guy. Idk. Told him I&#x27;m not interested. This time I keep my mouth shut about ROS.They obviously still don&#x27;t offer it publically. He sent me a calendar invite anyway. He said if you can&#x27;t make it or if you&#x27;re not interested, just cancel. Fair enough.
 Ok, so I just cancelled that meeting. Now I&#x27;m getting emails about me cancelling and trying to reschedule. 
 I don&#x27;t get it. I don&#x27;t want your software. I already said no on the phone and email multiple times and cancelled your meetings. I have an option to reschedule too but, I didn&#x27;t. Take a hint.
 Probably going to block them if this doesn&#x27;t stop soon. I&#x27;ve never had to do this before in my career with any vendor.

                              <span>I started as a temp at a small science facility last Tuesday. I feel ok here, it&#x27;s just a weird position to be in. I get along well enough with my manager and the sr admin on site. The Sr admin likes me but is already pushing for me to get brought on full time. I&#x27;ve gotten good feedback from them so I know that I&#x27;m doing something right.
 It doesn&#x27;t feel right that the sr admin is already pushing for me to go full time after only a week. I don&#x27;t even know what would come of this, the manager seems a little resistant to this but I imagine that&#x27;s because it&#x27;s only been a week. I can&#x27;t tell if anything is wrong or not but I could use some sage advice. I think if I got it, it&#x27;d be a good opportunity for me to be a jr. I came from a background of Helpdesk / Desktop support with sysadmin duties mixed in so I have a lot of experience with what they do and I could use more.

                              <span>I know that the solution is to get the framework updated for these ancient internally hosted sites and portals for them to be free of IE dependency. However, the answer is always &quot;there&#x27;s no budget for upgrades. Please continue to support&quot;. Access is becoming increasingly unreliable no matter how many IE Mode settings are tweaked on my end or the vendors end.
 External vendors are being given my contact information by procurement and purchasing departments and being told to contact me and I will fix it. I&#x27;m getting 2-3 requests a day from different people, knocking down my door screaming about how this needs to be fixed right this minute.
 I am not an applications person, the one applications manager we had left years ago. I am not sure how to approach this from a technical or professional perspective. I cant wave a magic wand and make incompatible technology suddenly work, but I also can&#x27;t simply throw my hands up and say &quot;Sorry, not my problem&quot;.

                              <span>We had a user use their Microsoft work email and create a Personal Microsoft account with it and now we&#x27;re stuck figuring out the mess. I wasn&#x27;t aware that you could run a personal and work account side by side using the same email but the issue we&#x27;re running into is when they&#x27;re logged into the browser on their work account and attempt to open a SharePoint document in the desktop app it prompts for authentication so they&#x27;ll type their email address and then get prompted to choose between the work or personal account. Once they select work, the account is signed in but the document is blank and eventually gives an error saying the document cannot be opened. 
 ​
 I&#x27;ve verified it&#x27;s any document on SharePoint opened in desktop app, even if downloaded and then opened locally. We&#x27;ve removed the personal account from her machine (this particular user&#x27;s is not domain joined unlike most), changed the primary alias on the personal account to a bogus email in hopes it wouldn&#x27;t recognize it and removed the company email, turned off &quot;auto sign in to microsoft apps&quot; to revert them back to local account, reinstalled office, signed out of M365 on both accounts on browser and cleared cookies, tried various browsers and banged our heads against the wall for a long time. Has anyone ran into this issue? Does anyone know how to get out of it? Closing the personal account apparently can be done, it just requires contacting MS support which if I have to I will.

                              <span>Howdy folks,
 After about a year of asking for our manager and dept head to give us an actual policy of what on-call entails and not just &quot;work with the team to make sure any off-hours issues are resolved&quot;, we finally have it in writing, and it sucks. 
 We are expected to respond to all issues that come in 24 hours a day during the 7-day stretch we are on call. All issues have to be answered within the 0-2 hour SLA, including those reported by slack, jira ticket, email, and phone call. This is in addition to our normal 8 hour work day.
 The volume of calls generally isnt that bad (2-3 per day), but its the SLA bit thats chapping my rear a bit. To meet this expectation I&#x27;d have to set an alarm on my phone to wake up and check slack and Jira every 90 minutes or so. And on top of that we are to answer any helpdesk calls that come in regardless of time. 
 Aside from the question of legality in my state (I&#x27;m asking a friend who is a lawyer about that), I wanted to get the opinion of folks on here. Is this even remotely normal/acceptable?

                              <span>Greetings,
 I have a peculiar situation at work where we once used exchange server 2003 back in 2009. And our primary DC was on windows server 2008. 
 Nowadays, we have our domain controler synchronized with azure every half an hour and we want to upgrade it from 2008 to 2019.
 So both our dc and azure are aware of the old 2003 exchange(now offline). Since our mails are on microsoft exchange atm, if we do the upgrade im afraid that something might go wrong since i dont know if both of them are aware 2003 is out of service.
 Is there any way to know for sure? Thnx

                              <span>They found someone better fitting with more experience and fired me.
 I&#x27;ve worked here for just under a year, I&#x27;m 25 and started right after finishing school.
 First week I started I had an auditor call me since an IT-audit was due. Never heard of it, had to power through.
 The old IT guy left 6 months before I started. Had to train myself and get familiar with the infrastructure (bunch of old 2008 R2 servers). Started migrating our on-prem into a data center since the CEO wanted no business of having our own servers anymore.
 CEO called me after-hours on my private cellphone, had to take an old employees phone and use his number so people from work could call me. They never thought about giving me a work phone.
 At least I learned a lot and am free of stress. Have to sit here for the next 3 months though (termination period of 3 months).

                              <span>We&#x27;re looking to replace our old VMware cluster of 4 hosts, 2 vSAN arrays, and about 60 VMs with an HCI solution. I&#x27;ve spoken to a number of vendors and it seems like everyone is pushing Nutanix very hard. Reading through some of the experiences here, most of them seem to be overwhelmingly negative on their HCI platform, and even more so on AHV. Has anyone actually had a positive experience with them in a reasonably small environment like mine? With the uncertainty with VMware&#x27;s future, I am leaning in the direction of considering them.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve inherited a project from the previous IT guy who left recently. It&#x27;s a small company, with just me and two other IT guys, supporting 500 users.
 The requirement is to build a SQL environment using Windows Server Failover Clustering. This will be a two node SQL cluster (active/passive) running on across two virtual machines.
 My question is what licensing will be required. The company has SA, so from what I&#x27;ve read only the active node needs to be licensed. Just looking for some guidance on what I need to get the company to pay for. Would SQL Standard edition, and licensing for the cores on the virtual machine for the active node?
 Sorry for the simplistic questions, I&#x27;m new to SQL and I find microsoft licensing very confusing.
 Thanks for any assistance.

                              <span>Hello, 
 It has recently occurred to me that part of job of IT and sysadmin is gaslighting users. Not intentionally. However over the years I have found that users will generally tell you a problem only for you to try it and it works. There have also been times where you make a change on the network, something you think won&#x27;t be affected is affected and you undo that change. Instead of explaining the process of what you did (because either the user wont care or understand) you say, it&#x27;s fixed. Or there have been instances when you kind of made a stupid mistake and instead of admit your mistake, you quietly undo the thing and the user is puzzled as to why it started working again. 
 I have been in IT for about 15 years in numerous roles and still carry a passion for it. I will passionately explain things to people if they will listen. For some reason though, I have found due to the environment and nature of IT, people either don&#x27;t take interest or done care so you are sometimes left to look like you just performed magic and it is now working. 
 I am just wondering if anyone else feels the same.

 https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/13lz9wc/cisco_ucaas_vs_ucm/
 I decided to go though that post and delete all my followup comments and summarize everything here.
 I&#x27;m no longer mad at Cisco I&#x27;m more philosophical about it. I can&#x27;t be mad at a lamprey for being a lamprey, it&#x27;s just in their nature to survive by providing very little and then continuing to take and take and take, forever. Cisco, sadly, is running hell&#x27;s bell&#x27;s to turn into that kind of company, right after Microsoft. Unlike Microsoft, though, Cisco is NOT a monopoly. Monopolies like Microsoft are government regulated and slapped down when they get too greedy. So, they don&#x27;t do disgusting things like release HARDWARE products that stop functioning if you stop paying monthly subscription …</span>

 Was it in the first year? Your first role? Second? Third? Etc… did you move to a role which allowed you to expand your skill set? Drill down certs? 
 I ask, as 2 1/2 years in and there is of course so much I don’t know but in the last two years my ability and overall knowledge has developed a lot.

                              <span>The company I work for has an Azure only environment. 
 We disable a user when an employee leaves the company (we never delete it), removing the license. 
 What we want is that an email goes out saying that the employee has left the company if someone tries to send the former employee an email. 
 I am trying to set up a catchall mail that sends that autoreply following these instructions (almost)
 https://social.technet.microsoft.com/wiki/contents/articles/30462.office365-catch-all-mailbox.aspx?fbclid&#x3D;IwAR0DOO6wZRZvJaLRa5SHaaINP8a4BAzuDJ8AiGDlqXuarLVIFY9jrDpLrcs 
 I set up a distribution group (not dynamic) with an email address [disabledusers@contoso.com](mailto:disabledusers@contoso.com) , I also set up an shared mailbox employeehasleft[@contoso.com](mailto:userhasleft@contoso.com) with the OOO autoreply. 
 I set a task in our offboarding lifecycle workflow to add the user to the disableduser group. 
 I changed the accepted domain (in exchange - mailflow) to InternalRelay 
 I set up a mailflow rule 
 &quot;Apply this rule if
 Is sent to a member of group &#x27;disabledusers@contoso.com&#x27;
 Do the following
 Redirect the message to &#x27;employeehasleft@contoso.com&#x27;&quot; 
 But this thing is not working. 
 Is there no simple way to do this? I feel like I&#x27;m using &quot;old&quot; on prem solutions for my Azure only environment. 
 Thanks so much for your help guys

                              <span>Hey all,
 Recently started a project to make sure Bios/Firmware updates on all of our Dells are up to date. I am using the ADMX files from DCU, in GP I have the settings as follows...
 &quot;What to do when updates are found... Download and install updates.&quot;
 and for update settings I have tested multiple different settings and none of the have worked, originally I had it set on Automatic updates, but they wouldn&#x27;t update. Then I set it for a specific time daily, I set it for 7PM last night on my test computer. Come in this morning and see it says it checked for updates last night at 7PM but the last time it updated was 3PM yesterday. So why will it not update automatically?

                              <span>Sorry just venting Experienced infrastructure guy, 25+ years, uk based. Working a fixed term contract, due to end October, However… Was told when I started (April 2022) that a permanent role was coming up that I could apply for. Many managers, including my own, hinting that it would be a shoe-in 
 3 days leave, came back and was off sick with gastric flu for 5 days.
 Found out yesterday that they filled the vacancy without telling me it had gone live or asking if I wanted to apply
 Questioned it with him, oh it’s a totally different role, no it’s what I’m actually doing right now!😡
 So here we go again trying to find a perm role. Starting now, because I feel as (late) middle aged white dude, without a huge amount of cloud experience, the tick boxes are against me.
 So fed up of it all. 🤦

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve recently started moving all our users with admin rights to the Protected Users AD group.
 We&#x27;ve had no major fallout from this after an extensive testing period but one issue remains that I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything about anywhere.
 We use a couple of Windows Server systems as print servers. We would like to manage them (print queues, permissions etc.) remotely using printmanagement.msc run from an elevated mmc.exe. When connecting to one of our print servers (Windows Server 2019 systems), the account is immediately locked out.
 I can see no unusual events when this happens (4769 [requesting kerberos service ticket], 304 [granting kerberos service ticket to a &quot;Protected Users&quot; member] and ultimately 4740 [account locked out]) and can&#x27;t think of a reason why this would happen.
 Have any of you seen this before? I&#x27;d be grateful for any imput!

Does anyone know of a script to remove this. Also if anyone has done this how would it inpact Windows Updates (they are done monthly automatically set by windows). As well as any other update. Would the end user have to call us to update certain software&#x27;s? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;ve got a real head-scratcher here. We have a user called Tim (not his real name) who&#x27;s calendar seems to be causing some major problems for other user&#x27;s Outlooks clients. When the other users have Tim&#x27;s calendar added to their list of shared calendars, their Outlook grinds to a halt and uses 40% of the CPU and causes total system instability. Every 5 seconds or so, it says &quot;updating Tim&#x27;s calendar&quot; in the bottom right before disappearing again. This continues constantly as it was affecting one user for over a week until they reported it.
 The only way to fix this is to remove Tim&#x27;s calendar from their Outlook completely - simply unchecking the box to display it doesn&#x27;t work.
 The weird part is not everybody who has Tim&#x27;s calendar has this issue, it seems to be 3 users out of about 10 who need access to his calendar. But all users who have this issue have Tim&#x27;s calendar in their Outlook, so I&#x27;m fairly certain the issue is actually to do with Tim&#x27;s calendar rather than the user&#x27;s outlook clients..
 So far I have tried; • Quick and full repairs of Office on both the user&#x27;s and Tim&#x27;s devices • New Outlook profiles for both Tim and affected users • Removing all offline and cached items from Tim&#x27;s Outlook calendar • Checking Tim&#x27;s calendar for any recurring meeting going for excessive lengths of time
 I&#x27;m honestly a bit lost as to what to try next so any suggestions are greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hi Everyone
 Coming from a SQL DBA background, I am trying to wrap my head around Azure architecture.
 I&#x27;m hoping I can have something cleared up.
 I have an Azure VM - E64-32s v3
 15 x P40 disks were allocated to this VM - With read-caching
 A storage pool was created using these disks to create one 30TB drive for SQL data files. (There is a separate pool for SQL log files)
 Now, the column size for the data file storage pool was created as 3.
 What does this actually mean? How does this affect performance?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 there&#x27;s a problem in our company with Microsoft Teams, especially with the chat feature.
 I think that Teams is a wonderful tool to use and can help us to boost our productivity at work. Unfortunately, some stupid colleagues use it to chat to each other, also creating groups. Now that the HR noticed it, they want me, as the IT admin, to disable the chat for everyone.
 I think that this approach is not the right one, firstly because there are a lot of people using the chat in the right manner, and secondly because a tool like Teams doesn&#x27;t make sense without a chat, for me.
 Now the question. Is there the possibility to restrict in some way the ability to create groups for some people or to talk to each other? I really can&#x27;t disable the chat for everyone, otherwise our dinosaurs colleague will continue to use the email as the tool to chat, send files, etc.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello,
 I have always used Exchange at previous jobs so far, but at my new employer Kerio Connect 9.4.2 is in use. And I am still trying to get used to it. Now I have 2 questions: 
 1.When setting up a mail account, we do document the default password assigned to each account in the process, but many users change it later. The problem: if a user falls ill, we would like to add an absence note for his mails. The easiest way to do this would be directly in the user account, but to log in there I would need his password. Is there a way to set up an out of office notification in the dashboard with the admin account as well ? 
 2.Sometimes it is also desired that another user simply takes care of the account of the sick user temporarily. The easiest solution would probably be to simply give the user the sick user&#x27;s credentials...if we know them. Well, in Exchange it was comparatively simple: You simply gave the substitute access rights to the mailbox of the sick user and could then set up his account in Outlook, even without knowing his password. With Kerio I haven&#x27;t found such a possibility yet. Is there such a possibility to give another user access to a mailbox ?

 As you understand from title , If I set DisplayName attribute of Security Group in AD then Outlook Contact Card is showing Global Security Group (no mail-enabled security group).

 Is it normal ? So expected behaviour?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m a young sys admin and one of my tasks is to ensure that we have enough computers,mouse,monitors, etc.
 I wanted to know how are you guys doing about that on your companies ?
 Do you have a specific budget (X€ per year?) allocated for that, or do you just buy when needed?
 Thanks everyone.
 PS; may excuse my english

                              <span>Hi all,
 Looking to potentially implement some more effective phishing/email attack testing against my end users.
 I&#x27;m just wondering what people are using these days.
 The main things I am looking for is that the templates are actually good, more resembling spear phishing then your general blanket generic phish, or easily converted to resemble them. Things like if it were to masqueared as a onedrive shared file it looks legit. The ability to replicate things like O365 MiTM attacks and more complex attacks would be great.
 I trust pretty much all my users to spot the obvious low effort phish, but recently due to how public the business is we get a lot spear phishing. We stop 99% of them but have had a few incidents where people have clicked through onto them, and frankly for the ones that have gotten through the various filtering I don&#x27;t blame them. They were good phish emails, branded up, using peoples names, and coming from legit domains it looks like our business would have dealings with leading to legit looking phish pages.

                              <span>Context: working for an SME, I&#x27;m the *only* IT Bod, I&#x27;m also the only remotely technical person in the business. It&#x27;s a full key man dependency with all the admin accounts etc sitting with me. I&#x27;ve argued against this for a long time but the business doesn&#x27;t &quot;have the resource&quot; to hire a second or train an existing person to be the second.
 Now for the processes, that&#x27;s all documented and ready to be given/read, however what do I do about admin accounts? For some products we have specific admin accounts, but I&#x27;m unable to give passwords/access because the person who is replacing me hasn&#x27;t been hired yet, so doesn&#x27;t have an email address I can give those details to. 
 For some products, we don&#x27;t have specific admin accounts as its licence based (tight company) and the admin just resides with me. I could make someone else in the team an admin but they won&#x27;t have the foggiest what to do with it and when the new IT bod comes along they wont have a clue how to transfer admin rights.
 What am I meant to do in this situation? How can I best facilitate an actual handover of administrative rights and privileges

 Hell no I don’t. I get to sit back and point the finger at Microsoft all day. I’d take an absurd amount of cloud downtime before even thinking about taking on that burden again. Just thinking about dealing with what MS engineers are dealing with right now has me thanking Jesus for the cloud.

                              <span>My current position at my current job is tough because although I worked my way from a tech into management I’ve a hard time proving to exec management IT is doing well. When any outage whether, it’s out of upgrades or equipment related they’re quick to hang me out to dry and threaten consultants. 
 I’ve decided to start applying at other places for a mix of Sys Admin, IT Manager, and VMware Admin positions but I’ve gotten 5 rejections so far. I wear so many hats here at this company sometimes this leads to some of systems being a set it and forget it so it’s hard to be razor sharp. After this 5th rejection I’m bummed out about my current situation and feel my only opportunity is to look at jobs that pay 2/3 of current salary just to get out but that’s not an option. Any way thanks for hearing a jack of all trades and failure at one.

 I thought I’d ask for your opinions and how you deal with tech at home.

                              <span>So the company I work for was bought out, all the great stuff happened, benefits cost more, no raise, no real good news for normal techs and all. We usually work on call in a rotation, work from home that week, and we are able to monitor everything and work for OT pay. Now its being rumored that they will not pay OT rates, still want us to work afterhours/on call, but their fix is to let us leave early, which is just offensive. Is this a standard across the board? Is this legal? When my rotation comes up, if I am asked this I don&#x27;t think I can comply honestly, because it does not feel worthwhile to have my whole week sidelined, and potentially working afterhours (usually i hit a few calls but probably around 3-5 hours extra during my rotation) at my base pay, just wanted some kind support or some kind of resource or baseline so I know what I am potentially going to be walking into. Thanks!

                              <span>We are a startup and have been using Jumio for a couple of years. We have used just their ID verification product and its been OK so far. A couple of weeks ago we got an email from their numbskull VP that they will increase their minimum license fee from 2500 USD to 25000 USD. Yes, you are reading right; 10 fold. They have upgraded their platform and they are trying to shove a bunch of things we dont need( many dont need) down our throat and make us pay for it. it freaking pisses me off. We will most likely switch out. Just an FYI post for those considering KYC products.

 My manager is an actual workaholic who quoted that this morning. I am pushover so I just nodded, and also because he has 20 more years of experience, and is an authority at this job. He makes ridiculous amounts of money, and seems like his focus has always been to advance himself, make tons of money, (which is nice when you&#x27;re not coming off as an selfish prick telling folks to miss important family events). He also works late nights, and seems like is happy to do so. How do you even deal with these type of people? How do you even support these environments? His boss seems to be fine that he is still doing late night events after so many years, and it&#x27;s funny to me that for all the work they put in, not once on how to actually build out a team and delegate properly. ugh.
 Edit- I also want to add, that I also do late night maintenances, but I couldn’t make a maintenance event few weeks ago due to family gathering which they were aware about. Manager was upset that I couldn’t make the event hence the post

                              <span>I&#x27;ve heard time and time again that the best-practice for monitoring tools is to only ever be alerted on things that require action from an actual person. 
 I agree with that philosophy, it makes crystal clear sense. Here&#x27;s the thing though: my workplace does not abide by that whatsoever, and it is intentional. 
 I&#x27;ve been trying and failing to clean up our SCOM environment since like March. 
 Every time I&#x27;ve approached my team and my boss about turning off an email alert that isn&#x27;t actionable, I&#x27;m always met with &quot;no, leave that on, I&#x27;d rather get the email than turn it off&quot;. 
 Every single person on my team receives hundreds of non-actionable alerts every single day. If you need information from a specific timeframe, you check your email alerts. Right clicking and &#x27;mark all as read&#x27; is an every day occurrence. 
 Sending a message in Teams that says &quot;you&#x27;re about to get bombarded by emails from what I&#x27;m working on, just ignore them&quot; is an every single day occurrence. 
 When we patch, we get thousands of email alerts that we have to sort through the following Monday every month. 
 I&#x27;ve tried telling my team that these alerts can be condensed into dashboards in SCOM where the information is just as accessible and your inbox stays clean. But they&#x27;d rather receive the emails. My boss is extremely clear on her stance that she&#x27;d rather get hundreds of non-actionable alerts per day and manually sort through them. 
 Do other places actually not do that? I&#x27;m putting a lot of effort into learning how SCOM works and how we can organize the data from SCOM to not rely on constant email spam. But my workplace wants the comstant email spam and has instructed me not to get rid of it. 
 Do you guys actually operate with the philosophy that emails should only be sent if an action is required?

 What have the fine folks at r/sysadmin done to push back and get the headcount needed to accomplish their work, or reset goals based on a reasonable work schedule?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 First of all, thank you for your valuable input and time.
 I&#x27;m a rookie sysadmin working for a fairly small company, and I&#x27;ve recently been tasked with exploring database rack monitoring. As someone with no prior experience in this domain, the vast amount of information available can be quite overwhelming.
 Overall i&#x27;m looking for a not too expensive setup to monitor our racks with a motion sensor and camera. 
 We rent multiple racks in different data centers, and our manager wants us to monitor these racks 24/7. The monitoring system needs to operate effectively in various environmental conditions, such as cold/hot temperatures and low/high light sources. Ideally, we&#x27;d like a camera to activate and record video on one of the rack&#x27;s servers when motion is detected. Additionally, we plan to dedicate a VM to manage the camera(s). Our requirements are relatively straightforward; we primarily need a camera to record any access to our equipment. 
 I&#x27;ve come across several recommendations from other sysadmins, with APC solutions being frequently mentioned. The NetBotz Camera Pod 165 appears to be a suitable camera option. However, I&#x27;m unsure if it can be used without a NetBotz rack monitor. I&#x27;ve also noticed suggestions for the Unifi camera solutions.
 Those solutions are extremely expensive for what we need to do. 
 ​
  
Would it be possible to simply use a webcam managed by the VM ? 
  
​
  
Are there good open-sourced project you experienced sysadmins are using for this particular use case scenarios ?
  
​
  
Which camera / webcams would be best suited for simply monitoring access to our racks? 
  
​
 I&#x27;m truly fresh out from school, we&#x27;ve done some image processing projects in python so maybe in the worse case I could improvise a cluncky script that launches everytime the VM boots up ?
 Apologies for the novice question, and I greatly appreciate any insights or recommendations you can provide.
 Best regards,
 Ben

This is applying correctly to all inboxes, folders etc, except for the Deleted Items folder. Where should I be looking to see why this particular folder is being retained rather than having the delete policy apply? Outlook shows that the deleted items folder is set to that 90 day policy, so not sure what gives. Thanks!

                              <span>Currently was assigned to find out and fix the issue.
 Here is a screenshot of the issue from control panel: https://i.imgur.com/xajRxuv.png
 Basically GPO deployed printer is copy-pasted with the identical name many times (usually only 20 actual print queues) but now there are +200 duplicated entries. 
 What I have found out/know so far:
 - Issue seems to be limited to Xerox printers. The HP Printers seem to have no issue and are deployed the same way
 - The used printer driver is &quot;Xerox Global Print Drivers PS&quot; version 5733.1100.0.0 Typ 3
 - Medical environment. Many users per PC.
 - Afaik the issue is company-wide (50ish PCs). Not sure how wide though.
 - The device manager do NOT list the offending printer queue.
 - In Windows 10 menu -&gt; Devices the printer is listed (several times) as &quot;Driver not available&quot;.
 - If opened in the control panel -&gt; printers you can not interact with it beyond 3 options: Remove device, troubleshoot device and (if I remember correctly from the client pc) properties.
 - Full Windows environment (Both client and servers).
 Tried searching the issue already and found out it seems to be a xerox-specific issue but don&#x27;t really know where to start and still am kinda a rookie in many regards.
 Anyone had the same issue somewhere and know of a resource to fix it or to identify the problem better?

                              <span>Hi, We have PaperCut set up for a bunch of printers and all is good. Just added 2 new printers, iR-ADV C359, and when we switch to PaperCut the control panel just goes to a white screen and won&#x27;t load the app. We can still access the local menus such as 123.We have upgraded the server to the latest version (22.[something]) and also deployed the updated .jar file. 
 The server reports the printers are at 1.3.0.This seems to be a bigger issue than just my 2 new printers, anyone having this problem, and any workarounds?
 So far our vendor hasn&#x27;t been much help.
 ETA: vendor assures us that the printers are supported and that the reason they aren&#x27;t on the supported list is because they are too new.

                              <span>I am working in one of the most bizarre scenarios I&#x27;ve ever seen.
 ​
 Had a group of architects and senior engineers dump a massive dumpster fire on the support team. Literally dozens of bugs. We got NO support documentation at all, diagrams are wrong, redundancy testing not being complete before releasing configurations to support, nothing. Not 1 bug ID was provided or information or anything.
 ​
 Anyone ever see anything like this before?

                              <span>One of our users had setup an iCloud with their M365 account, and it seems to cause conflicts with calendar invites. 
 The issue is that users sending invites from their iPhone/Mac calendars to this email get intercepted by iCloud and goes to the user&#x27;s iCloud calendar without ever making it to M365. 
 Has anyone else seen this issue and/or have any ideas for fixing it? The user is against updating their iCloud email.

                              <span>In the UK, if it matters (240V).
 We have a new Eaton UPS that should be hardwired (9PX with extended battery module) Our server room has two 16A supplies, presented as &quot;commando&quot; female sockets (2P+E, IEC 60309).
 The user manual states a cable cross section of 4-16mm2 or 12-6 AWG, which seems oversized. It&#x27;s possible to get up to 10mm2 as a flexible 3-core cable, but is it right? One end is terminated directly into the terminal block of the UPS, and I was hoping to have the other wired into a 16A commando plug so I can plug it in to the socket.
 (The electrician will be making the connections at each end, but have requested we source the cable and plug).
 I&#x27;m happy to source the 10mm2 cross section cable if it sounds right and would fit in a 16a connector. Length is a few metres between UPS and socket so cost is not an issue.

 What I&#x27;m thinking about is to create a Docker container per user and only give them access to said container. Within this container they&#x27;ll get sudo access. Is this a feasible idea?

After getting the update a few of them (Lenovo Thinkbook Gen 2) ran into some BSOD issues. It seems that when turning off secure boot they work just fine.
 ​
 Seems like the machines get the BSOD error Code: 0x0000428.

 how to solve a problem?
 User sync only works one way from onpremises to cloud when adconnect is configured. but when AD DC is configured with password requirements that is at odds with the password configuration in microsoft 365. when a user resets their password in the cloud, ms365 generates a password that doesn&#x27;t match the AD DC policy which creates a conflict. how to solve a problem?

                              <span>Looking for some advice from my fellow sysadmins with regards to backup of MS/Office 365.
 We&#x27;ve been using Veeam for a couple of years (on-prem backup server), and IMHO it&#x27;s been working quite well.
 But one of my co-workers is sceptical to the whole concept of having all our files, e-mails, etc stored on an on-prem server - in case it gets compromised, then we have a huge problem. So he does have a valid point, even if we have done everything possible to avoid this (separate network, server is only accessible indirectly, etc). 
 So currently, we&#x27;re running the backups manually (boot server, run backup, shut down server again) once a month or so.
 Now that our Veeam licenses are about to expire, we are considering not renewing the licenses and live without backups and rather rely on the various safety features in MS365.
 What would you guys do?

                              <span>Hi!
 I&#x27;m no sysadmin, currently more of a very low level support. Think google workspace administration, sitting down with a coworker if they switch from Win to Mac to explain some basics for example, and the omnipresent &quot;why is the printer not working&quot;, that sort of think ...
 My question for you guys is - where to read about a &quot;proper&quot; business IT setup? By that I mean how things should run in a professional setting, compared to private users. I know local accounts are not the way to go, nor is setting up 20 devices in a row manually, or purchasing one MS Office license at a time, running MDM ... but where can I learn about the correct procedures?
 This place can get confusing. I can read and try to understand what ADDS is, or GPO, PDQ inventory, FOG deployment, and a bunch of other terms, but it doesn&#x27;t help much for the overall picture
 If you got a moment to help out, thank you.

                              <span>Good morning, 
 I am a IT tech working on becoming a sysadmin myself. A step in this plan is solving an issue with outlook. 
 My company uses Salesforce to collect and synchronize email signatures on outlook.
 Ever since we started deploying windows 11, We have been facing a comfort issue for a lot of users. 
 The issue is the salesforce signatures synchronize on outlook and appear under signatures on this device. Though the signatures appear here we are unable to select them in the choose default signature block. 
 We are using outlook version 2304 on window 11 22H2. 
 If anyone has any lead for a solution I will be forever grateful.

 This isn&#x27;t very actionable as it requires us to manually harass end-users into improving their passwords/password re-use, only for them to make the same mistakes a few weeks later and show up on the report again. 
 Can anything be done, at the very minimum, to automate nagging users to have a better score?

                              <span>Around the end of April, some of the mailbox rules in Outlook stopped automatically moving messages to their appropriate folders in my inbox. These rules have worked unchanged for years. I&#x27;ve tried recreating, enabling/disabling, deleting Outlook program files associated with mailbox rules but nothing in my googling or help from Microsoft has resolved my issue yet. Microsoft 365 support is still investigating.
 A couple weeks ago I noticed an Exchange Online transport rule not working as it has in the past. It looks at sender domain, if the sender if outside the org, and dmarc&#x3D;pass, dmarc&#x3D;bestguesspass in the header of messages to determine if the message should bypass spam filtering. Now it appears it won&#x27;t bypass spam filtering if the message is sent to more than one recipient, even if the rule is a match. I find this strange since the rule doesn&#x27;t check recipient information at all.
 Anyone else experiencing any shenanigans with Outlook rules or Exchange Online transport rules?

She noticed that after connecting via rdp, the resolution on the desktop PC changes, but when she changes it back to the previous setting, the image is still off and there are some parts that are completely cut off like the taskbar. Turns out opening up the intel graphics control panel and changing the setting to &quot;Adjust to screen&quot; (or something like that iirc) fixed it. 
 Is there any way to prevent RDP from messing with these settings? If not, at least some way to automatically change them back when the computer starts up again.

                              <span>You don&#x27;t know what you don&#x27;t know. You don&#x27;t even know to ask in order to learn something to make your job easier. Usually, you have your methods that get the job done and not enough time to find better ways to do things. 
 Sometimes, you luck out and stumble across an extremely simplified solution to what seems to be a complex task, and it absolutely rocks your world with how easy the task just became.
 Many times, these solutions are considered &quot;common knowledge&quot;, and you scratch your head whenever someone around you has their mind blown.
 The thing is, what you may think of as common knowledge is something that someone else in the same role as you has never heard of. Yet.
 If you&#x27;re like me, you&#x27;ve failed up into your current SysAdmin-ish role by pure random happenstance, tenacity, failing better (meaning that you fail, learn, and move on to the next more complex failure, learning again, and moving on... you get my drift), and turning a hobby into a career. You drink from a firehose your entire professional life and earn your scars through pure experience, frustration, and one or two nervous breakdowns. I&#x27;d spare anyone that last experience if I could.
 Drop your wisdom in here so that others may benefit. It doesn&#x27;t matter how simple you think it is. If it&#x27;s something that changed how you perform a task, or it redefined a process, please share.

 I can&#x27;t see any difference in the server configs, WinRM is configured the same on all servers, certificate is the same on all servers, I already restarted the servers, but some just don&#x27;t wanna be managed...

                              <span>Hi /r/sysadmin
 I&#x27;m currently facing an issue with VMware Horizon 8 and instant-clone image publishing, and I could really use some assistance. Whenever I try to publish my instant-clone image, I encounter the following error message in Horizon:
 &quot;Publish Error:
 Fault type is AGENT_CUSTOMIZATION_FAULT - Internal template vm-542704 customization failed. Error description not set by agent.&quot;
 I&#x27;ve already attempted a couple of troubleshooting steps, but unfortunately, the problem persists. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;ve tried so far:
 Removing AV software: I thought that the AV might be interfering with the publishing process, so I temporarily uninstalled it from the system. However, this didn&#x27;t resolve the issue. See here; https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/90781 
 Using sysprep instead of clone: In an attempt to overcome the customization failure, I switched from using the clone method to sysprep. Despite this change, the error message still pops up.
 I&#x27;m now at a loss for what to do next. Have any of you encountered a similar error while publishing instant-clone images in VMware Horizon 8? If so, I would greatly appreciate any insights or suggestions you might have to help me resolve this problem.
 Thank you in advance for your help!

 I&#x27;m trying to create a guide for myself, when I&#x27;m done I will share it somewhere. Most likely I will not use this instead of vault/let&#x27;s encrypt/windows CA etc... But I want to learn the certificates in depts.
 First I done it with openssl for learning the basics, how to create and generate CRL,CRT. I created a config.cnf file https://pastebin.com/zf6XMk2W for the openssl configurations. There is something I couldn&#x27;t do it. Which is the SAN - subject a…</span>

                              <span>We occasionally have a development update file that we need to give customers to fix issues with the software we provide.
 I&#x27;ve been looking at the options of sharing from the OD, but I&#x27;m not keen on the Dev sharing a file direct from the OD via email. (He is under a business use case and special group to allow him to do it btw) Ideally I want no connection from user to Dev OneDrive.
  
 It seems the best option I can find is to have some kind of sharing site he is allowed to upload the file to, then the customers gets an email with a time limited download.
  
 So questions.
  
1) Does anyone know secure sites that would fit the bill?
 2) Is there a way to build something like a simple download site in AWS? We could put up something in AWS if needed. (Not my area but we have some knowledge)
 3) Does anyone have any links that they could point me too for what&#x27;s need to make that in AWS?
 4) Or any other suggestions

 ​
 my hoster told me that he will end his service till the end of the month. I am running quite critical things on this service. I am able to get by backups in a .img.gpg format by the hoster. Now I need a VPS-Service where I can upload the last backup in this format to move without long downtime.
 My current setup is
 4GB RAM
 2vCores
 200GB storage
 100 Mbit up/down
 Located in Germany
 ​
 I could take some more RAM, storage and vCores. But it is not necessary.
 Are there any (pricey) services that are capable of this setup?

 The DOL has information that in my reading would be hard to argue that any IT position is non exempt, falling under the professional exemption. You need college/training to support IT systems and as long as you’re paid the minimum - how would you argue a position is non exempt otherwise?
 https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/17a-overtime
 I tried searching this sub (I didn’t look very hard or long) and didn’t find any posts of people saying they were able to fight their exempt status.
 Have you seen or heard of anyone fighting their exempt status?
 Edit: Here’s an example of someone winning but their job was more helpdesk, not sysadmin https://www.dkattorneys.com/publications/personnel-exempt-flsa-overtime-requirement/ We as sysadmins have some say in the design of IT systems.

I&#x27;ve ran into an issue with our network layout and I&#x27;ve been working with HP&#x27;s TAC for weeks now and have seemed to accomplished nothing but to circle around to my original problem. I&#x27;m hoping there might be someone here that better understands Aruba&#x27;s wireless solution to help me make a bit of progress.
 I&#x27;ve ran into an issue where with our branch locations, even though traffic can traverse between the controller and the AP, it can&#x27;t establish a IKEv2 tunnel. Due to this it continuously has the AP reboot. Related, it seems that the tunnels continuously renegotiating eventually overloads the VM and causes it to drop. Both of these issues seem to be resolved with disabling CPSec. (Which the TAC recommended as a remedy)

 And I see no mention of if it also will drop IPv6 offers in addition to IPv4.
 Any ideas on if it will?

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I am working towards an FSRM solution that triggers an email alert and action when a blacklisted ext is uploaded on all of our File Servers. I tried a whitelist approach but this will not work in our environment.I am pulling the blacklist from the famous https://fsrm.experiant.ca/.
 ​
 I have been back and fourth with our infosec team and my own research on what is the best course of action if a user does upload a blacklisted file type. Most people online say to do an SMB denial, some want to do a network kill switch, and some want to lock/disable the user account.
 ​
 The Infosec team did agree with my research after I suggested an SMB denial and disabling the AD account but after further research I feel this may not be the best solution. Reference here:https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/6pq2uv/help\_with\_fsrm\_command\_to\_disable\_ad\_account/After I sent this new information, they decided to advise that we utilize Sentinel One&#x27;s logging and then it can escalate from within S1 and then we can kill the network from the console or re-enable.
 ​
 What do other Sysadmins do for this?

                              <span>We&#x27;re about to embark on an exciting deployment journey involving Cisco DNAC, ISE, and WLC across four sites, and we would love to tap into the collective knowledge of this amazing community to gather suggestions and tips for enhancing our architecture.
 Here&#x27;s a brief overview of our deployment plan:
 Scope: Total 4 sites (1 HQ and 3 remote)
 DNAC Cluster: We will have a DNAC cluster with three nodes located at our headquarters, ensuring high availability and redundancy.
 WLCs and PSNs: Each site will have two Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs) and two Policy Services Nodes (PSNs) to handle wireless connectivity and authentication.
 ISE PAN and MNT: At our headquarters, we plan to host ISE Primary Administration Node (PAN) and Monitoring (MNT) nodes for centralized management and monitoring.
 Integration with DNAC: We&#x27;re integrating the PAN node with DNAC using PxGrid to leverage the capabilities of both platforms.
 Site Details:
 Each site consists of Catalyst 50+ switches, 300+ Catalyst Wi-Fi 6 WAPs, and 2000+ users.
 HQ and Remote Sites are connected over the Site-to-Site (VPN.
 We are working with a partner who will assist us with the design and deployment, but I firmly believe in the power of community knowledge. I know that the insights and experiences shared by professionals like you can significantly contribute to the success of our project.
 Additionally, we are considering deploying SD-Access, do you recommend its implementation in our deployment.
 So, I kindly request your suggestions, tips, and best practices.

                              <span>So, I just installed an IDF in an outbuilding. I installed a switch with a single Aruba AP. The AP comes up on the controller and even claims to have 5 clients with assigned IP addresses--2 of which are this laptop and my iPhone--, but none of them work.
 So rather than dumping my whole env on you guys, can you teach me how to fish? It looks like the traffic is blocked somewhere, as if the VLANs were aligned from point A to point B, i.e. AP to access switch to core switch to router.
 Current config:
  
MDF Core Switch: I have the Wifi VLAN 92 Untagged Tagged on the trunk port to the IDF (#51).
 IDF Access Switch: I have the Wifi VLAN 92 Tagged Untagged on ports 17-20 (with WAP in port 19) and Untagged Tagged on the trunk port #28 (SFP).
  
Context:
  
Here&#x27;s a network diagram and a sample of my VLAN config on the Core Switch.
 Core switch is TP-Link T1600-52PS.
 Access switch is the smaller 24-port version: TP-Link TL-SG2428P(new generation has diff model numbers, this used to be the T1600-28PS)
 VLAN 86 is Mgmt, 92 is Wifi, 99 is wall jacks (I didn&#x27;t pick &#x27;em: hold your applause)
  
Update 9:54 PM ET: I had the Tagged and Untagged labels backwards. Sorry for the confusion. Obviously, I don’t know what I’m doing.

                              <span>I am sure there is a reason for why we need RD and RTs separately. Reading up only gave vague distinctions but I haven&#x27;t got a convincing answer why on a real deployment, we would want RD and RTs , 2 different entities, to distinguish routes. Is my understanding correct here:
 Say, you have 2 tenants, say Coke and Pespi, each with say, a number of departments (accounting, sales, etc) connected to a DC. You would have separate RD for each tenant on the router there at the DC. (Route-leaking from Pepsi to Coke is a different concept that theoretically would only need RDs ?). 
 Coming back to question, we would want export and import RT configured, because, say one satellite office of Pepsi only has a sales dept (with import RT B) and wouldn&#x27;t routes from accounting dept (RT A), hence, RD: Distinguish a tenant, RT: export/import: Only import routes from a particular &#x27;group&#x27; of routes even from the same tenant. Does this sound correct?

                              <span>Hey guys just doing some research and II don&#x27;t think I understand over subscription rate on these ports. So is the subscription measured on the OLT port so say you have an XGSPON (10 gig port) and you spilt 1/64 do you sell each customer like say 300 meg and say that&#x27;s oversubscription rate of 100 present ? What is a typical over subscription rate? Is that bandwidth to each subscriber limited by the how may time you split or is configured on the port?

                              <span>Hello, we have a large chassis Cisco 4506-E switch with two large power supplies in the chassis. I&#x27;m planning to move one power supply to a new UPS battery backup. If I unplug one power supply, but the other power supply remains powered/unchanged, the switch and all its modules should stay completely online right? I only ask because in the past I had an issue with another brand chassis switch when I unplugged one of the two power supplies, several modules in the chassis powered off unexpectedly. Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;m super frustrated and don&#x27;t know where to go next. On Thursday last week, we started having intermittent issues with our Comcast fiber service. As an example, we cannot get to finance.yahoo.com or secure.bankofamerica.com . HTTP/S , ping, trace route all fail. Some folks across the US cannot connect to the VPN (and some can). I put in a ticket and they blame our firewall (Barracuda). So, I put in a ticket with Barracuda, and they say it&#x27;s an ISP issue. We then plug a laptop directly into the fiber switch to bypass Barracuda, and still having Internet issues.
 Trace route always times out after hitting 96.110.117.181, which whois says is comcast routing.
 I then took our comcast cable connection going to our secondary network and plugged it into our firewall. I set it so that it would be the primary gateway instead of our fiber gateway. Traffic works just fine (it&#x27;s just slower). When I do a traceroute through the cable gateway, it takes a different route and does not hit 96.110.117.181.
 Comcast support keeps telling me the problem is our equipment and don&#x27;t want to seem to acknowledge the issue is their routing.
 Am I missing something here?

                              <span>in terms of NAC... the workstation is authenticated to the switch via dot1x, cool thats fine. But then the user logs in, and the switch reauths the port using the user&#x27;s dot1x. Whats to stop a user from just bringing a machine from home and passing their AD creds to dot1x and getting online? Can i prevent the machine from re-authing when the user logs in?

                              <span>Hi all,
 In our project we use PLC to control field devices with remote IO modules. This communication between PLC and remote IOs is handled by the PLC proprietary Ethernet protocol for SIL4 (safety integrity level).
 For troubleshooting reasons, we need to analyze the packets flowing between PLC and remote IOs so we set the port mirroring option in communication module of PLC. We can see other protocol packets with their respective IO IPs (i.e NTP) or ping packets. However, we can not capture the application data packets (UDP) with Wireshark. We tried port mirroring from both COM module and managed switch (to eliminate COM module mirroring feature bug) but no chance. Neither setup could capture data packets. Managed switch we used is Ruggedcom.
 Is there any restriction/limitation in port mirroring to not mirror the proprietary protocols or something? Are there anyone used this feature in industrial Ethernet environment?

                              <span>Hi all,
 I work in pro-av but I&#x27;m also our resident network engineer. I purchased a Fluke MS2-KIT back in 2012. It&#x27;s been great, but right now I am needing to replace several of the remote IDs and the #1 cap. 
 I know this means I need the MS2-IDK27 set and the MS2-WM. Both of these are very expensive replacements considering the cost I paid for the kit back in the day. I realize the same kit is almost double the cost now.
 I am considering moving to the LinkIQ kit, but I am wondering if there are better or more economical options that may or may not be Fluke. 
 I am obviously not going to put the money out for a DTX or full certification kit as this is a personal purchase. 
 What are you all using?

                              <span>One thing I&#x27;m struggling with is how this transition is made. I think traditionally someone would go out and get a CCIE/CCDE which would give them the knowledge to design and architect networks. Is this still the case? I recently renewed my CCNP and seems like I really had to drink the Cisco cool-aide on the most recent iteration of the test. I&#x27;m looking for more of a vendor agnostic fundamentals of network design and architecture.
 How many years experience would you say is required for this transition to take place?
 Because there is no Masters Degree is &quot;Network Architecture&quot; - what resources would you say give the best &quot;education&quot; in this pursuit?

                              <span>Hi,
 I have some Access Points connected to a Switch (HUAWEI in this case).
 I configured some trunk ports (with two VLANs) to some access point to propagate a GUEST network and a private network.
 Now I need to implement L2 port isolation ONLY for the GUEST network and leave the private network without isolation. Is this possible?
 Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;m pretty new to IT (I used to clean houses so no real tech background), and have been working on an entry level help desk doing password resets, showing users how to use Outlook and general Windows 10/11 tickets. I like it so far.
 I was able to look over the shoulder of one of our level 3 technicians and I was really interested in learning more. I asked my team leader how if I could start being more involved with those types of tickets and was essentially laughed at for my lack of experience and while nobody said this directly I&#x27;ve felt that because I&#x27;m a woman and have no experience I won&#x27;t have the opportunity to move up.
 Once a month they let us look over a pallet of hardware before it goes to recycle and some of the guys grab servers for homelab type tinkering. I&#x27;m less interested …</span>

 Any experience with Zyxel? I am interested to know how this brand can fit our needs and what reputation they earn.

I got a second unit online however it came without a file system. When entering console there&#x27;s a message stating, &quot;Image program does not exist.&quot; When I plug the switch into the network, the port that is used turns green, however neither the MAC Address or an IP is appears.
 What can be done to reinstall BootRom &amp; Comware to the switch?

 I have a network containing of multiple VLANs. In this setup, I have a Mikrotik CCR1009 Router and a WireGuard GW Server (Box).
 In VLAN50, the Router has two IP addresses: a VRRP IP of 172.16.50.1 and a VLAN IP of 172.16.50.7. The WireGuard GW Server has the IP 172.16.50.100.
 I also have a NAS on VLAN70. In this VLAN, the Router has a VRRP IP of 172.16.70.1 and a VLAN IP of 172.16.70.7. The NAS has the IP 172.16.70.10.
 Now, I have a VPN Client connected to the WireGuard GW Server. The WireGuard GW Server has the IP 192.168.99.1 within the VPN, and the VPN Client has the IP 192.168.99.10.
 When the VPN Client (192.168.99.10) tries to access the NAS (172.16.70.10), it works, but there is a delay of several seconds to establish the TCP connection. When analyzing with Wireshark, I ca…</span>

                              <span>Good day all, As title says I am in need of a way to perform a factory reset of a CISCO Catalyst 3850 switch. The device was given out from a former contractor, but access is behind password, and we are not able to reconfigure it. We tried with both the Mode button in front, at startup, to access the flash_init to modify the config.text but that is write protected, and by the reset button in the back, all to no avail.
 Are there other ways to bring back the switch at a default configuration, either hardware or by CLI?
 Thanks to any reply.

                              <span>Hello guys, I hope you had a great weekend.
 I have to configure OSPF neighbouship between my MLS (multilayer switch) and my VPN concentrator for redundancy reasons.
 The issue is that the VPN concentrator&#x27;s public IP address is in the subnet of a secondary IP address of the MLS as illustrated in the following diagram :
 https://prnt.sc/DhSexwCBLcdz
 From what I know, OSPF only sends hello packets from the primary IP address. Meaning that even if I declare the 10.10.20.0 network in OSPF and make the interface active, VPN won&#x27;t receive any OSPF hello packet.
 What is the best way in that situation to form a neighbourship between these two devices?
 ​
 Thanks in advance, have a great week !

 My official job title is Information Technology Support Technician. Approximately 50% of my job is resolving tickets, however the other 50% of my job is building automations for our systems (SharePoint, security systems, inventory, ticketing system), interacting with vendors, managing inventory, managing AD and Azure, etc. I have a wide pretty wide range things I’m asked to work on. 
 I’m not trying to be the kid angling for a promotion, but had casual conversations with my boss, and he said he wasn’t sure if my current responsibilities were accurately reflected in my job title. Just curious what other people think.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have my certificate authority handing out Radius certs for the WiFi clients. I can see the initial connection is established using TCP 135 and then it will use a random RPC port range from 49152-65535. Is there a way I can have my certificate authority communicate over a small range of ports. I want to avoid opening up the entire 49152-65535 range to all my end user devices so that they can just enroll in a radius WiFi certificate.

 I&#x27;m a new IT Tech at my job and I&#x27;m looking for tools for my boss to get me (caz we don&#x27;t know where the last set went before me). I&#x27;m shopping on Amazon and having a tossup between kits (leaning towards some Klein Tools tho). 
 THE QUESTION: I&#x27;ve seen people do the opposite, using passthrough connectors with regular crimpers and just trimming the wires before the crimp. I wanna know, can I go the other way around and use a regular connector in a passthrough crimper? 
 Responses will dictate my buying decision, so please advise amd converse :)

                              <span>So I’m responsible for infrastructure at my workplace and we have a new boss. Leadership demanded we cover 7 days a week so we have shifted schedules to cover weekends, some of us also work ten hour shifts - the new boss doesn’t like it.
 He reaches out to our ISP to schedule a call to discuss a new location and instead of coordinating it for a time I’m scheduled to work, he schedules for a day I’m not working, acknowledges I’m not working in the email and another team mate (who knows nothing about our network) can join. 
 Later, he asks me in person to join if I can. I thought about it but I didn’t even get the meeting invite and no, It’s not urgent, It’s my day off. Waiting two days to have the call wouldn’t cause any problems. 
 I think he’s expecting me to work more than my 40 at this point on a regular basis. I don’t and I will fight to not to or be compensated with additional time off. We’ve already been short 2.5 people for almost a year and I’m behind on everything - I’m at the point where only the squeaky wheels are getting grease - 95% of my time is spent on helpdesk and I’m even falling behind on helpdesk tickets.
 I was looking for a new job but stopped to see how the new boss would work out and if he could get us back on track. Concerned, I might need to start looking again.

                              <span>Looking for advice here. So I am a younger guy currently working in helpdesk trying to move to a full sysadmin role. At my company, Head of IT has always encouraged me to grow. In my performance review last year, he said he wanted me in a sysadmin role by Fall of this year. My company offers a bonus/certification program that pays for and gives bonuses for passing certain exams. So I have been taking advantage of this program and getting the certs as others have done. Others have gotten these certs and no one has ever batted an eye about it. In the past 2 months, I have been doing a lot of studying and got 4 certs on our in our certification program. On the last 3, my boss has been really slow to respond about them and follow up with HR/Finance so I get the bonus. Now, after my last cert I got, he emailed me back quickly saying to stop getting certs for now and he needs to talk to the CTO about it. Someone on my team got the exact same certs and they were praised for it, but when I do I am told to stop? I am just trying to grow into the role that I want at this company and I am confused as to why he wants me to stop my growth. I mean I understand if he doesn&#x27;t want people taking advantage of the bonuses and then leaving, but I have been with this company the entirety of my career in IT (I am young so not that many years). 
 I understand I am in a unique situation and I don&#x27;t know if other companies offer things like this. Any advice? Am I overthinking? Should I ask him about it? All feedback is welcome. Thanks for reading.
 Edit: I don’t believe that it is budget or cost related. There have been other people in the past who have gotten certifications that grant bonuses that are double mine, and they were encouraged to keep going. I am leaning more that it is him wanting to protect the company and from people getting a bunch and then leaving.

                              <span>Work for smaller ISP that has recently started doing more B2B service. We’ve been whitelisting the few public IPs for port forwards to our ordering and provisioning systems and creating the tenant/admin account and allow those businesses/admins to complete all their own onboarding for their users. This is quickly becoming not scalable though. We are planning on setting up an SSL Web VPN page on a Fortigate with bookmarks to the individual services they need to access but trying to find a solution for the Fortigate VPN accounts. 
 Ideally we would create the single new admin account for the business and then allow them to create all their own users as they hire/fire. Trying to figure out the best solution for a Radius/LDAP server for the Fortigate to use for authentication that we can configure each tenant on and allow them to build/remove users without seeing the other tenants obviously. I tried to look at FreeIPA and it’s use of realms but that doesn’t seem to work as I expected it would. 
 Our current internal Radius server is just TACACS fed by a MySQL backend which is fine for us to run SQL query’s for the couple of user changes we have per year but that’s obviously not ideal for this B2B use case. 
 Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Earlier this week, Microsoft released a patch to fix a Secure Boot bypass bug used by the BlackLotus bootkit we reported on in March. The original vulnerability, CVE-2022-21894, was patched in January, but the new patch for CVE-2023-24932 addresses another actively exploited workaround for systems running Windows 10 and 11 and Windows Server versions going back to Windows Server 2008.
 The BlackLotus bootkit is the first-known real-world malware that can bypass Secure Boot protections, allowing for the execution of malicious code before your PC begins loading Windows and its many security protections. Secure Boot has been enabled by default for over a decade on most Windows PCs sold by companies like Dell, Lenovo, HP, Acer, and others. PCs running Windows 11 must have it enabled to meet the software&#x27;s system requirements.
 An attacker who successfully deployed BlackLotus on a targeted system could obtain complete control over the OS boot process—giving them “almost the same capabilities as firmware implants, but without having to overcome the multilevel SPI flash defenses…or the protections provided by hardware (like Intel Boot Guard),”

                              <span>Hey everyone, I seem to have a bad habit of jumping from the frying pan into the fire when accepting new roles these last few years. Examples are:
 ​
  
Roles listed as fully remote and put as fully remote in the contract, and then told two months in I need to relocate immediately or be fired
 Multiple managers fighting over what tasks I should be assigned and asking me to convince my managers to allow me to work on things or be dismissed (why did you hire me then?)
 Asked to frequently travel and told I will not be reimbursed
 Onboarding consisting of being given an employee ID and the phone number for the help desk; team leads too busy to do onboarding but will ask for status on projects I don&#x27;t even know about, etc
  
What kind of questions can someone ask during the interviews to try and suss out these kind of crazy situations? I understand this is a time of complete chaos for a lot of companies and onboarding in our field is always a bit sink or swim, but this is well beyond what I&#x27;m used to. One question I&#x27;m planning to ask next time is &quot;can you describe your onboarding process?&quot; and &quot;who will I report to? Are there multiple individuals I am expected to report to? If so, what strategies do you have to ensure alignment between their priorities?&quot;

 There is already monitoring in place for cpu usage/memory/disk space/IO/etc.
 What I am looking for is more about is to extend my productivity perhaps with applications I have missed to know. e.g. I use top/htop/iotop for looking at processes, but maybe there is something better. I googled around, but either my search criteria is not good enough or there isn&#x27;t much more I can install to help myself out on dark days

                              <span>Full disclosure, I&#x27;m a security engineer. Definitely know my way around AD and Azure AD, but I&#x27;m nowhere near AD architect-level knowledge, so this could be a stupid question/scenario. 
 My Company, Company A, is cloud only. Newer company, acquiring other smaller companies and then having to integrate their environments into our own. 
 No on-prem AD, just Microsoft 365 and Azure AD/InTune. 
 ​
 We acquire Company B and they DO have an on-prem AD domain.
 So we need to be able to have our Company A admins perform tasks on the legacy laptops as a domain admin would, but the users also still need to be able to be on their Company B domain in the meantime until the merger of all the things is actually complete and the people are fully moved to Company A resources (or get new laptops).

                              <span>Hello reddit. Sometimes my coworkers make me feel crazy.
 Here&#x27;s an example. I have been tasked with setting up a new server. Currently, a large amount of employees use software that relies on a server. We&#x27;re planning on replacing the server. I was wanting to use DNS to point to the new server using the old server&#x27;s name to avoid having to reconfigure a large number of computers and applications.
 My coworkers don&#x27;t like the idea. They would like to update all the computers and applications instead. I&#x27;m concerned about missing some computers and having upset employees.
 In addition, I proposed that we could update all the applications with a new name for the server, but use something more generic than the servers name so that when we do this next time, we won&#x27;t have this problem. My coworkers didn&#x27;t like that either.
 Am I wrong? Do I need to rethink my strategies?

 I have a very interesting case study for my university to do and I am wondering if there is any comprehensive tutorial on how to configure a HA iSCSI storage (working in ActivePassive mode) using the Pacemaker and the DRBD. Unfortunately I am completely green at using the Pacemaker and the DRBD and frankly I don&#x27;t have time to learn it. Can You please help me? I will take any useful information there is. Thank You in advance :D

                              <span>Pretty sure the new IT trainee has a gaming addiction that is affecting his work. He’s missing Mondays a lot and he’s alway tied and taking sick days. What makes it tougher is that when he’s well slept he’s an awesome workmate. I’m responsible for him but I’m not sure how to discuss it with him. I’d like to keep HR out of it.

                              <span>I work at an MSP, I was told I will have a series of regular clients I&#x27;ll make reoccurring visits to each week as I get going. 
 My motorcycle is a bmw adventure bike, it&#x27;s quiet and polite. It&#x27;s very very far from some loud nasty Harley or dousche sport bike. I have Kevlar &quot;chinos&quot; and plain black protective mid tops(think converse is but just all black with a tan sole). I can leave my jacket in a luggage case on the bike too. 
 So I should pretty much look the normal part when I&#x27;m interfacing with them, I&#x27;m just curious if they saw or it came up if it might come off poorly or reflect against my company. 
 I&#x27;m probably over thinking this and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s fine, I just would like to hear other people&#x27;s thoughts. The big motivation I have for this is two fold: I get milage reimbursed and my bike gets like 60mpg VS my explorer getting 18-20mpg, so I&#x27;ll make out good on it. Secondly, I just like to ride and every mile on the bike is a good one.

Cisco
 Arista
 Huawei
 H3C 
  
Cisco and aritsa are super expensive where we are. Huawei and H3C are super affordable. 
 Anyones got experience with the two? And which is better?

                              <span>I was trying to corelate Cisco NXOS and Linux networking stack. Is the NVE interface in Cisco terminology for NXOS same as what Linux VxLAN device is? For Linux, my understanding is , VxLAN device is a virtual interface that we create, attach this device and the real interface that servers/hosts are connected to a bridge interface. Is VxLAN config is Cisco, the way we assign VLAN a unique VNID, then assign this VNID to an NVE , similar? Is this understanding correct? Thanks

 Whats the exactly technical difference in a use/case in which I have minimum 2x ISPs/WAN.
 With both configuration I can hit the goal to push my connection trough a specific WAN-Interface ? Or am I wrong ?
 Thanks :)

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m in the middle of migrating our current WAN facing firewalls (ASA and Firepower) to Palo Alto 3320&#x27;s. With Firepower, the concept of &quot;trying&quot; (because, Firepower) to block a URL is a case of putting the URL on the rule, then block/allow depending. At the moment, I&#x27;ve mimicked the Firepower structure, in the sense that I&#x27;ve created the URL Category entries and applied them to the Security Rules. Apologies for not having this completely accurate, but I did a POC last with Palo Alto and I remember that it wasn&#x27;t as straightforward as building out the rules like I have currently. There where &quot;dependencies&quot; and other categories involved in order for it to work. I&#x27;ve forgot exactly how I went about perfecting it in the end. I think I had the URL rules setup like I do currently, but I had a catch all for low risk categories etc... at the bottom, so the rest of the webpage URL&#x27;s can be downloaded to.
 I know the rule setup in Palo Alto isn&#x27;t as straightforward or &quot;obvious&quot; as say, Firepower, I know Firepower sucks overall, but I need to wrap my head around the best way to structure rules for the Palo again.

                              <span>I installed EVE-NG after having massive issues getting Cisco FTDv and FMCv running in GNS3. I managed to get both VMs up and running, but for the life of me I can&#x27;t figure out how to get connectivity between the two devices. 
 One issue is that when I built a &quot;network&quot;, and drag connections to the FTD/FMC, it does not provide me any options to declare &quot;which&quot; interface I want to connect to. If I could do that, it would not matter which network I built between them, it should work. I don&#x27;t need internet access from the VMs, I just want them to talk to each other. 
 Now, this is not that big of an issue on the FMC, as there only seems to be one interface connected, and I have put it on the same network as the FTDv. 
 But I think the core issue is.. From the look of the interfaces, both devices are using loopbacks as the interface connected to switch in EVE-NG. I don&#x27;t want to change the IPs on those interfaces, for fear that I lose the ability to console into the devices, which is currently working through the EVE-NG web console.
 ​
 On both FMCv and FTDv, both eth0 interfaces are configured for the desired management network. But the Transmit/Receive statistics on these interface show they are not connected in EVE-NG. So, given I don&#x27;t seem to have the ability to specify which interfaces on the VM I want to use, how on earth do I connect the two eth0 interfaces in EVE-NG?

                              <span>Hello All,
 I work at a medium-sized company (4-5K Corporate Users with about 50 US-based offices) that is working towards moving to SDWAN. Currently today we run on full Cisco Hardware - C8Ks, ISR 4Ks, and Cat 3850 and 9K Switches, with no other vendor hardware deployed at our branches. Within our Datacenter we have a pair of c8500s that aggerate our WAN Connections and run as DMVPN Hubs. We run a legacy design at all our branches with MPLS running as the Primary Transport and DMVPN as the Failover if we experience LEC or provider issues on the MPLS side. With this design, we route all traffic external to the branch to our main Hub no matter the destination… Internet or On-Prem infrastructure. Years ago, this was great for us because we only had to manage one firewall pair that handled al…</span>

                              <span>Over the last few months, I researched cloud WAN architectures (think of Azure OneWAN, so private infra between sites, i.e., PoPs or datacenters). The more I research them, the more I am convinced that they are really just like big (e.g., Tier 1 AS) internet service provider (ISP) networks. Cloud service providers (CSPs) face the same challenges and appear to use fundamentally similar technologies, except that they might be more &quot;agile&quot; in adopting new tech such as the latest flavor of SDN. Both do traffic estimation, traffic engineering, many CSPs also use MPLS tunnels like many ISPs, etc.
 Thus, my question: What are differentiating factors between a CSP WAN (think Azure&#x27;s OneWAN) and a large ISP network?

I have built Server 2019 USB w/ Rufus, I can boot it in both Legacy and UEFI. I can get past initial install (Copying files...). but I&#x27;m sitting here on the 2nd boot, where I&#x27;d expect the welcome screen.. instead I see a windows flag and spinning dots circle below. it&#x27;s been 20min. server must be booting wrong partition? what is supposed to boot &quot;windows boot manager&quot; partition??
 server is a Supermicro, maybe 6 years old. IPMI is working great.
 EDIT: waited.. maybe 90min.. all good!

                              <span>relatively new to cloud support so I&#x27;m at a loss on what to do on this one. 
 I was able to setup and deploy a Mac Pro from ABM and assign it a profile in Azure. Setup went smooth and it pulled down all the required apps and management profile. One of the required apps is our company portal.
 When I open up Company Portal it tells me it hasnt been set up for corporate use yet and to begin setup. It then wants to download and install the same management profile that was installed during automatic enrollment so it fails and I can&#x27;t use company portal.
 When I check azure it shows the device has been enrolled and is compliant so I&#x27;m at a loss how to bypass this check by company portal. I even tried to go and assign it through portal.manage.microsoft.com and that didn&#x27;t help.

                              <span>Hello r/sysadmin!
 If you work on a team that rotates weekend shifts, do you get the following Monday off? We only have a couple weekend shift per quarter and all generally work 9-5 mon-fri.I&#x27;m working my first weekend shift and realizing they expected me to come in Monday.
 That&#x27;s 12 days in a row unless I use my personal PTO(which i did for monday). That&#x27;s not illegal it just seems insane and it is literally the legal limit in Cali. I&#x27;ve worked drive troughs, shitty retail, waited tables, gone from help desk to sysad in one org working very hard... I&#x27;ve been in the Army Infantry...
 Other than deployment and 1 BIG exercise per year for training, I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever been expected to work 12 days in a row. Is this normal? I know tons of orgs rotate weekend shift, just curious if you get comped on the back end or not.

                              <span>I’ve read / done a few courses that speak about the technical implementations, but I’d love to read a book about best practice design. Not how DNS or DHCP or NIC teaming works or what a DMZ is, but rather - how are these actually implemented in real life scenarios. Any books that speak about designing a network, a DMZ, how to design a switching infrastructure with core switches, access switches, redundant ISP connections etc etc etc 
 Does anyone have any recommendations?

                              <span>Hey sysadmins,
 If you had to transfer, say, 1 PetaByte from your office in San Francisco to another office in New York, how would you go about doing it?
 My guess is there are 2 ways:
  
use rsync to transfer over the internet.
 
clone the data onto a HDD, and fly it across to New York.
 
 The first solution is cheaper (depending on your ISP) but may require plenty of time, weeks and even months (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong).
 The second solution might be quicker but slightly expensive.
 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone here has some experience with this?

                              <span>Hey all,
 Scrub admin here. I&#x27;m having issues with getting kerberos auth to work with a Postgres RDS instance. Followed official AWS guides on how to enable it. Enabled Password and Kerb auth on the instance, linked it to a managed AWS DC, created users on the db ([user@bone.dog.woof](mailto:user@bone.dog.woof)), and added them to the rds_ad group (user I&#x27;m trying to log in as exists on the DC as well). I then threw in the krb5.ini file under C:\Windows that points to the domain/realm. Issue is when I try to connect with domain creds via pgadmin with kerby enabled, I get a SSPI context error. Using dBeaver, it&#x27;s KDC_Err_Client_Revoked.
 Using Windows to accomplish this not Linux if that&#x27;s important to know.
 Anyone have experience with this before and know what I&#x27;m missing?

                              <span>So, this is an odd one that I can&#x27;t seem to figure out.
 We have a user that works remotely sometimes as well at the office, and some of the time when connecting through RDP the machine rejects the password when connecting remotely. When this happens, we try connecting the user locally and it works fine, try again remotely and it fails. 
 The odd this is sometimes when this happens, when we try a different machine/location sometimes it will work sometimes not. But if we reboot the machine it seems to work fine
 As far as I can tell from Event Viewer there does not seem to be any errors generated when this happens unless there is some other logging that I need to turn on.
 These are both Windows 10 machines and all updates are done, and outside of the common check username and password are valid I am not finding anything specific to this.
 Any thoughts?

                              <span>I know a lot of people say absolutely never do this, but hear me out. Dual Juniper switches, setup in a virtual chassis config - each model being 48 port 10GbE with 40GbE interconnects.
 In a small setup (3x VM servers and 1x SAN), why not do this? The switch can handle different MTU/Jumbo Frames per port, VLANs etc (so all storage networks can be on their own VLANs). In the virtual chassis setup it means no chance of config differences between switches. Controller A of the SAN could go to Switch 1, and Controller B of the SAN could go to Switch 2, so full redundancy.
 The VM servers would have 4x ports per server - 2x of which would be for VM traffic and their associated VLANs, and 2x would be for the SAN traffic. Again would go between switches, so a single switch failure would have no downtime.
 Can anyone give a good argument on this setup on why this shouldn&#x27;t be done?

                              <span>With the likely upcoming death of 3rd party apps and who knows about the old UI, I&#x27;m curious what other good resources are out there. I&#x27;ve been out of forums for a long time as reddit has served it&#x27;s purpose for various communities such as /r/sysadmin and /r/MSP.
 So now seems like as good of time as any to check out some forums as a good potential replacement.
 So what else is out there? Obviously I can search around, but rather get good opinions so not to waste time creating accounts on forums that may suck.

                              <span>Hey all,
 I started a Hybrid Project with MigrationWiz; everything went fine with the Discovery phase and creating the batches. Submitted batches on schedule without a hitch. Now I have 4 Failed and cannot submit a batch because the error is with the destination.
 Please verify the destination admin credentials and refresh.&quot;
 I did this a few times, verifies it perfectly. Contacted support 2 days ago. The case was then escalated and died. Opened a new case this morning, and escalated again. I do not expect to receive a response.
 MigrationWiz went to crap recently. What gives?
 Anyway, if anyone has any insight to resolve this issue kindly let me know as of right now I am SOL.

                              <span>I have a lot of well rounded IT and Tech knowledge. I tend to lean more towards AI/ML and dev work, but I do a lot. What certifications do you think would open the most doors and compensate the best for me? I&#x27;m being advised toward ServiceNow CSA. I&#x27;ve been eyeing potentially AWS Solutions Architect? However, I want greater insight from people with more much knowledge than I have.

                              <span>Hi, For some reasons Gmail is blocking incoming email from O365 tennants. I found on Internet that making a connector in Exchange to the Gmail ipv4 addres (so no ipv6) solves the problem. It&#x27;s working fine now :-) Just wondering if it&#x27;s the best workaround.

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 My business currently has me as the IT manager, small team of 3 and a development manager, team of 7. 
 The development manager is leaving and I’ve been offered to take over the managing of both teams. Now I know nothing about development really, at most I use powershell and cli etc. 
 They’re going to bring in a product manager below me to assist in deciding what new features to target and speccing it out, so most of my day to day would be people management and escalation in terms of the dev team. The IT team is going to get an apprentice at the bottom end to help move people up to fill any gaps when I’m not doing my day to day. 
 So two question’s really 
 1- has anyone managed a development team with minimal knowledge, and do you have any info or tips? 2- what would this role be called? Seems like a chance to bump out my CV a bit so want to make the most of it. 
 Thanks

                              <span>I primarily do web development, but recently a long time friend asked me help digitise their legacy workflows as they deal with a lot of paper. 
 I&#x27;ve got them setup with Google Workspace and will be helping on board them with a CRM for client management, as they do work for their same pool of clients a minimum of once a year. But I will also be installing and managing four new Windows 10 office PCs (HP Elitedesks)
 Can anyone please advise any best practices to help secure and manage these computers. I&#x27;m not local to them, so will be able to do onsite visits every couple of months, but it won&#x27;t be like popping around the corner to help them out. So anything I can do to help manage them securely remotely would be appriated.
 I&#x27;ve moved them away from Office and Outlook to web based GSuite. The CRM will integrate with GSuite through the browser. File management will be primarily scanned documents and saved PDFs going onto Google Drive and the CRM. 
 Browsers will be Chrome, probably managed through Google Workspace, uBlock origin installed. 
 Password management either via Google password manager or Bitwarden. 
 Remote support is currently provided by Teamviewer, but I don&#x27;t&#x27; think they&#x27;re on a paid plan, so I&#x27;m sure that will get cut off soon, and so I&#x27;ll give Chrome Remote Desktop a go unless an alternative good value solution can be suggested?
 Not sure if I should be doing any special configs with Windows?
 Is it worth having a dedicated AV in an office environment in addition to Defender? If so, what are people using?
 Any advise or links to best practices guides would be appreciated on how to approach a small business deployment like this. Thank you

 ​
 we will receive a Canon Selphy CP1500 soon - in most usecases the printer will be used in wi-fi direct prints, but it may be necessary to connec tit to the local wifi.
 I want to put it in printer vLAN, but i can&#x27;t find documentation on what ports are needed
 i found documention for canon business printers, but i guess i won&#x27;t need all of these ports and i only want to allow the necessary minimum
 ​
 has someone experience with canon selphy printers in this regard or with canon printers in general to guess what the bare minmum ports for printing would be?
 thank you for your advice!

 I&#x27;ve only ever used RDS for sessions, not for VDI.
 For VDI I know I need to make a Windows image that the end users will get. But for updating the image with patches or installing new software, can I just update the existing the image and VDI will pick that up, or do I have to update the image and provision it again?
 I&#x27;m just a bit confused on once I have the template Win 10 image, how do I keep it up to date

                              <span>I&#x27;m using a Hyper-V to simulate a network, as I&#x27;m building a Group Policy from the ground on up. I have three VMs:
 FS Windows 2019: Network Adapters
  
DCComm [for &#x27;Domain Controller&#x27; Communication only] - 192.168.5.15/255.255.255.0/192.168.5.2)
  
My DC: Network adapters 
  
DCComm (192.168.5.10/255.255.255.0/192.168.5.2))
 MyPVT (Communication Between Clients and DC) (192.168.4.10/255.255.255.0/192.168.4.2))
 Ethernet (Auto Assign IP)
  
MyClient: Network Adapters:
  
MyPVT (192.168.4.150/255.255.255.0/192.168.4.2))- Used to access the Internet, through the DC
  
The idea is to use Group Policy Management Console on MyDC to create a folder and copy files to MyClient. I tried first by using a share on my host network, which did not work. The share was going to be USB attached storage from a router, and my DC could not see that.
 I then created a second Windows Server 2019 PC strictly for file shares (detailed above as FS Windows 2019). I deliberately put those on another network (using another virtual adapter) , thinking this would prohibit direct access by the clients. Both DC and FS servers can ping each other, and my DC server can access the share folder on the FS server, but Group Policy is not copying over the files. The folder created correctly.
 To create the folder, I&#x27;m using the path: User Configuration&gt;Preferences&gt;Windows Settings&gt;Folders and created a folder here with the action being to Update.
 For files, User Configuration&gt;Preferences&gt;Windows Settings&gt;Files. Same thing, I&#x27;m using the Update action.
 Again, the Folder creation worked, but the file copy did not. Why not and how can I fix this? Any ideas?

                              <span>How do you deal with security anxiety? I have been in IT for 20 years and been through layoffs, mergers, outages, software roll outs, you name it, which never bothered me. However every time crowdstrik alerts my anxiety goes through the roof. Like what if this is the time we get compromise. 
 How do people stay sane will all the security incidents happening around the world?

Does Lumen credit customers in full or only partially? Id appreciate any insights.

                              <span>Question - not sure if you guys have seen this - but I&#x27;m upgrading a pair of nexus from 9.2.3 to 10.2.5 with a 320gb lag going down to the array (160 per switch).Running physical cables not optics/fiber.While upgrading nexus primary member to 10.2.5; all four 40gb interfaces would not come up nor would they even show a transceiver was even connected. I opened a case with pure and they restarted the switch service, and bounced the nics (cuz we have no option to) and nothing came up.I rolled back my config and the vPC came right up on the primary.opening a case as we speak; but wasn&#x27;t sure if anyone saw the same issue.I did previously configure &quot;service unsupported&#x3D;transceiver&quot; so that shouldn&#x27;t have been an issue and everything was working prior to upgrade.Wasn&#x27;t sure if anyone had run into this?

                              <span>Does anybody here have experience in taking the NRS I certification? I got the self-study bundle a while back and am scheduled to take the exam toward the end of the month. I started looking up practice questions, however, and noticed there&#x27;s a lot of questions that were absolutely not covered by the study material I have. Are these older / no longer relevant questions or is my study material simply lacking? For example: What is the basic unit of framing in SDH and the bit rate for its transmission? I just did a ctrl+f on my study guide and there are only 3 spots that SDH is mentioned and none of them describe the bit rate.
 Obviously I can Google the answers but there&#x27;s a LOT of questions on those online practice exams. I can already pass the provided practice exam. Actually I took the provided practice test before even reading the material and I passed, barely. I expect now that test would be easy. I&#x27;m just worried about questions not covered.

I&#x27;m currently employed, meaning I have the basic soft skills needed to hold down a job. I get tons of interviews whenever I&#x27;m looking to advance my career, so I&#x27;m clearly a desirable candidate. But I never get past that first interview. Usually it&#x27;s the standard &quot;you&#x27;ll hear from us&quot; and that&#x27;s that. But one dude who interviewed me for a night shift position at an NOC actually said to my face he didn&#x27;t think I could do it.
 So, you&#x27;ve already interviewed 5 other candidates whose retinas aren&#x27;t scarred, and I walk in with a dog and dark glasses. Everything you know about me comes from my resume, which up until this point has put me on the same footing as the other 5 candidates. How do I sell myself?

                              <span>Hello. It seems that on our ASR9K, after a reaload/power loss, the OID on bundle ether interfaces changes.
 That isn&#x27;t much of a problem, but our monitoring system throws a hissy fit. Also historical data in the monitoring system is tied to the old OID?
 Is there something I can do in the IOS XR configuration in order for BE interfaces to have a more permanent OID?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a couple of Ubuntu boxes on 2m network cables connected to a TP-Link gigabit ethernet cable.
 The NICs are both Intel Corporation 82579LM Gigabit Network Connection (Lewisville) (rev 04) &amp;
 The switch looks like a TP-Link TL-SG1008D (looks like it, haven&#x27;t got physical access to it currently).
 I am only getting 30 MB/s which seems very slow. I tested the disks and they are both over 100 MB/s.
 This seems rather slow. The box is not doing anything else significant. I used iotop.
 My guess is it&#x27;s the cables can remember where they came from but it may have been eBay or Amazon.
 Does this sound likely or is there something I have missed? I&#x27;m thinking of getting replacements from somewhere repeatable in the UK like eBuyer or https://cpc.farnell.com.
 What do people think?

 I would seriously recommended that the mods of this sub pin the letter as this has a serious impact on the future of reddit. I know many could care less about third party clients but having third party clients gives a better user experience and takes away some control from the reddit overlords. I want to choose what software I use to access reddit and with this api change we are all going to be limited on our choices

 You guys might have heard of IT under Finance department, but have you guys ever heard of IT under HR?
 Our IT department is under the supervision of the director of HR and IT, who we will call Lisa. Lisa started off at the company as an HR consultant. Eventually the company fired the previous director of IT, and hired her as the full time director of HR and IT. Under Lisa is an IT manager that manages the IT department.
 Lisa has no knowledge of IT, but still attends our daily meetings. Ever since HR took over, we had more frequent meetings, calling meetings for pretty much every single little thing. Even something small like setting up a naming convention for desktop and laptops, they had a least 2 meetings already, with no final naming sch…</span>

 What a generation.. the last one to know what it was like before everyone had the internet..to dial-up AOL... to today. We can write letters, checks, and cursive.. We had ICQ, IRC (still use today), Napster.... what a ride..

 • Ability to perform troubleshooting and analysis of PC hardware, PC operating systems (Win95, WinNT, Win2000, WinXP, Windows 2007) and office automation software, with expert level knowledge in at least one area of specialization.
 • Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (MCSE)
 I wonder what year this company works in. For those who aren&#x27;t aware besides the obvious Win95, you can&#x27;t even get MCSE anymore from Microsoft.

 I have a rather supportive executive staff, who is willing to accept changes to the environment that we need, and allows me to have near full control of the department.
 I’m still rather new to IT (less than 2 years full experience).
 Any tips/advice appreciated!

I try my hardest to avoid calling anyone in the organization a &quot;client&quot; because I don&#x27;t want to encourage this service provider/recipient dynamic. As far as I&#x27;m concerned, my function in the org. is to keep the information technology systems and processes working, NOT provide value to you in the form of &quot;customer service&quot;. In most situations, &quot;good customer service&quot; and the necessary protocols and SOPs go hand in hand. When they don&#x27;t, STOP going up the chain of command or berating my &quot;dedication to quality service&quot; because you didn&#x27;t get what you want, how you want. I am your fucking co-worker doing my part to keep this shit floating, not someone you hired to do as you want.

 Also...
 Has anyone else noticed this trend of utilizing legit websites&#x27; redirect URL format to get you to their phishing pages? This particular link is using two nested redirect URLs -_-

 I can’t say i didn’t see this coming, but what I will say is how is it that end users still think they can get away with this?
 A for effort I suppose
 It provided a good laugh today, which was needed between all the other stuff going on.
 What’s some stuff your end users have tried to install?

                              <span>If you have installed Windows 10 using a USB drive with an autounattend.xml file on it, this may pique your interest.
 TLDR: If the EFI partition on the system is too small, Windows 10 devices can not update to Windows 11 through a standard feature update. If you have ever used an autounattend.xml to install Windows from a USB, it&#x27;s likely the EFI partition is too small.
 We all know the (somewhat crazy) requirements to run Windows 11. One lesser know requirement (possibly new) not documented (yet) by Microsoft is the size of the EFI system partition. For those curious, the EFI system partition is what computers use to boot and talk with UEFI BIOS. Pretty important to have. This could be a new requirement as I have updated several devices to Windows 11 before, but now, those same models ca…</span>

One for admin work one for answering email. They were logged in using their non-admin logins, but then having to log in/out to their admin accts to do 95% of their jobs. It was a mess; completely unproductive environment. They had extreme difficulty doing, or even understanding, the most basic of tasks. 
 Since they have to login and out so many times, they do not log out of servers - they lock their sessions. This makes them vulnerable to a Mimikatz attack. 
 Help me see the light. With UAC and SentinelOne/ CrowdStrike,etc. is there any benefit whatsoever to running two logins these days?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 As the title says, I&#x27;m wondering how much ram does your company computer have? I&#x27;m talking here about the general computer, not the specific one that have special requirement.
 I&#x27;m currently on Windows 10 with 16gb ram for the majority of my task force. The CAD users have 32gb.
 I recently made an in-place upgrade to W11 and saw that it use quite more ram. Idle, I sit around 6 to 8gb of ram consumed. This made me think I might have to upgrade everyone to 32gb (or 24? I feel this is an odd number).
 ​
 Thank you!

                              <span>I applied a GPO (Interactivity Logon - Machine Inactivity Limit) to an OU to auto-lock computer after 15 minutes. I needed to remove it and apply it to some nested OUs because it was locking a kiosk account that was under the initial OU.
 So I unlinked the GPO from the OU and linked it to the nested OUs. All the nested OUs got it after a GPForce. But after unlinking from the initial OU, it is still applying to the kiosk OU. 
 There isn&#x27;t a Disabled for this particular setting, so I don&#x27;t know how to apply an OU that will overwrite the lockout. 
 Anyone know how to clear out a policy that has been removed if there isn&#x27;t a way to apply a &quot;Disabled&quot; policy. Or would setting it to lock at 0 seconds mean it never auto-locks?

I&#x27;m trying to establish an SSH connection from one Kali machine to the other. I have properly configured all the necessary settings, but I&#x27;m encountering an issue with the incorrect fingerprint during the initial connection.
 I have ensured that the permissions on the ~/.ssh directory are set correctly, the SSH service is running, and I have copied the public keys appropriately. In the sshd_config file, I have configured &quot;PubkeyAuthentication&quot; to &quot;yes&quot;. However, when I run the command &quot;ssh -i /etc/kali/.ssh/id kali@ip&quot;, I receive the following error: &quot;The fingerprint is incorrect.&quot; I regenerated a pair of key but i steel have a diffrent fingerprint and it is always the same finger print it does not change

                              <span>There&#x27;s an ongoing debate around our office about the need to skill up on containerised workloads. As a mid-market MSP the only thing we run on-prem in a container is a DNS filtering service. Across our entire stack and customer base I cannot find another application for containers. Yet obviously there&#x27;s lots of talk about this being the future for a lot of applications.
 So my question is anyone running containerised workloads (Docker, Kubernetes, and the sort) on their on-prem infrastructure? If so what kind of things are you using containers to accomplish? Did you write applications in-house that you now host or did a vendor/ISV provide them this way?

                              <span>I&#x27;m inheriting an absurdly unmanaged environment of devices, somewhere around the 100 devices number and there is a large diversity from a couple of Win 3.1 and 2000 devices all the way up to w10. But most of the fleet is a mixture of w7 and w10 (enterprise). As well as the obligatory smattering of Linux devices here and there (mostly RHEL based). 
 The environment is also an &#x27;offline&#x27; environment, generally with no direct or proxy Internet access (though I could configure a proxy if absolutely needed to) I&#x27;m looking to start tidying up the fleet of...shit. and I&#x27;ve never actually been the one to stand up config tools like SCCM/configmgr, Ansible, Puppet etc. 
 I don&#x27;t really like the idea of SCCM due to cost the relatively small environment. So am considering tools like Ansible, Chef and Powershell DSC. 
 I like the idea of PowershellDSC as most client endpoints already have the powershell required as well as the native powershell management. And the environment is primarily Windows.
 But it doesn&#x27;t seem to be used my most people over other config tools.
 Ansible on the other hand seems to be almost the defacto option and is better supported in the community. 
 I&#x27;m generally hoping for any feedback or opinions of the two options if anybody has experience of both?
 Another option could be Ansible for POSIX/*nix and DSC for Windows. But this seems like overkill

                              <span>Hi,
 I work in an organisation of around 7000 people with around 200 people in the IT department. I&#x27;m tasked with improving/sign-off on our naming standards, so far we have (see picture):
 low level account: john.smith@contoso.com
 Active directory privileged accounts using RBAC:
 T0a-smit001 (domain controller and tier 0 assetts)
 T1a-smit001 (Tier 1 assets such as application servers)
 T2a-smit001 (Tier2 assets such as laptops) 
 O365 admins: [jsmith@contoso.com](mailto:jsmith@contoso.com) (non synced account)
 Azure AD infrastructure, 2nd tenancy: [john.smith@contoso.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:john.smith@contoso.onmicrosoft.com) (non synced account)
 We have more cloud environments coming along... 
 The question I have is what&#x27;s the best way to manage the naming standard?
 Ideally I want something that&#x27;s easy to see purpose at a glance, without screaming administrator.
 I&#x27;m also getting pushback from people saying they have too many accounts\passwords to remember.
 Also, do you differentiate the account name for things such as contractors and 3rd parties?
 Advice appreciated.

                              <span>Yesterday I posted a question here (but deleted) relating to an issue with my server being completely unresponsive to SSH and any query etc due to the Disk/CPU getting absolutely battered.
 By chance I came across the solution on another subreddit. 
 https://forum.gitlab.com/t/after-upgrade-from-15-11-5-to-16-0-gitlab-ce-down-cpu-100/86924/33
 Thought I&#x27;d give this a little bit more attention since it&#x27;s not in their release notes and it literally brings any server to its knees. It&#x27;s been a stressful 24hrs lol

 We are at the beginning stages of an AD and 365 tenant consolidation between 3 different companies. I am looking for a (semi?) automated way of gathering information that we could use. 
 Each site has a similar setup, on-premises AD, Azure AD connect, Office 365
 For example: 
  
Active Directory information (DC names, roles, domain, forest levels)
 User, group and service account list
 Azure AD connect information
 SharePoint site export
 Total SharePoint and OneDrive sizes
 Exchange online export
  
Anyone know of a great script or tool that would bring this information in? If not I can break down some instructions for my fellow sysadmins to run multiple scripts. 
 Thanks for any help!

                              <span>I am looking for some advice on how to progress with an issue I am seeing for the company I work for (UK based with a .com address).
 It looks like the company that hosts our DNS records has gone bust. Our site and DNS records are available, but all the services for getting into our domain are unavailable (although the host site is still up) along with their telephone number and any ability to log tickets. We have tried looking online for options andcan see a number of comments on sites saying they appear to have ceased trading. Looking at Companies House (register of UK companies) they are overdue and it looks like they may actually have gone under.
 My question is what do we do now? The records are still avaialable and working but we need to get them migrated to a service that we can trust and make changes to. We can&#x27;t get through to the host to open a request to do this though. I was thinking of reaching out to ICANN as this is a .com domain but I am unsure if there are any other options available to us here.
 Has anyone gone through this before that can give help/assistance on this?

                              <span>I started working at a manufacturing facility about 5 months ago as a system administrator (or, that&#x27;s what the position practically is). They basically brought me in to get their systems upgraded, propose projects for development of their infrastructure, and conduct maintenance along with upgrades of software (along with helpdesk).
 There is a database (SQL Server) that is used for collecting sales information for customers. One of the upgrades I am going to be doing is upgrading the version of SQL Server being used along with the Windows Server version being used due to EOL of the server versions.
 Originally, I was going to be conducting the regular maintenance plan of getting software upgraded to latest versions along with some hardware upgrades.
 However, after analyzing the data in the database, I noticed issues that exist within the data itself, including redundancies, inconsistent data, and other issues with improperly built databases. My understanding is this is a database they&#x27;ve been using for years. Based on my experience so far, there have been issues they&#x27;ve had to deal with for a bit because of how the system is set up.
 Something I&#x27;ve been doing is looking at how their database is set up and recreating it using the database normalization techniques to reduce the issues we&#x27;ve been having (on a separate server of course). Along with this, I developed a web based application as a way to interact with this database. 
 I presented my ideas to my supervisor regarding my work and showed what it&#x27;s capable of. He seemed really interested in it and is going to be meeting with me to discuss it further.
 I&#x27;ve heard the horror stories of lower employees having their work stolen or credit taken by their supervisors. Should I be concerned about this? Part of me wants to go beyond expectations in this role, but I&#x27;ve been told to not do so by others. Should I stick with doing regular upgrades in my role?

                              <span>Good Morning everyone!
 We’re looking for implementing an Asset Management solution soon. We’re a medium size software company and all our devices are managed by an MDM so until now we haven’t felt the need for a dedicated asset management solution. However, with the growing number of assets and additional controls expected from the accounting team, we’re now looking for a good cloud solution.
 With so many options and due to the fact that providers adopt different pricing models (some charge by asset, some per user, others per site) and also don’t publish pricing on their websites, I was wondering if you guys could help me with some basic info about the solution you are using:
 - Provider:
 - Your organization size:
 - Price:
 I really appreciate any help. Thanks in advance and have a great weekend.

 Not sure this is the best place to post this, but Chase / Zelle are having major issues. Many people are seeing scheduled Zelle payments duplicated and wiping out their accounts. Chase customer support is on hold for “extenuating circumstances”. 
 This is a huge issue and want to spread the word where I can. SysAdmins gotta know what’s happening in the tech world. Good luck everyone

 How trustworthy this keys are ? After all it&#x27;s just a key not a cracking software!

 we have a fair number of people departing in a few months (education environment) and so we&#x27;ll be disabling their AAD/Microsoft 365 accounts soon. I&#x27;ve been asked if it&#x27;s possible to export all data (Onedrive for business/Outlook/Teams messages/Sharepoint Online sites etc.) for some of these users, in case they want to access it in the future.
 As I&#x27;ve stated, since this is an education environment, none of these users had access to any data that would be considered confidential, secure, or anything like that. From what it looks like, there&#x27;s no way to export this data, neither from their end, nor from the admin center. I did find something about using eDiscovery to do it, but we don&#x27;t want to use additional licenses or software to do any of this, especially since this won&#x27;t affect our operations at all. If need be, I&#x27;ll just tell the users to export their messages and download all their files manually, but seeing as many of them have upwards of 50 or even 100 Sharepoint sites (mainly due to MS Teams, but also manually created groups), I can&#x27;t imagine this will be wildly popular.
 Ideally, we&#x27;d like to know of a way for the users to be able to export their data by themselves, but I imagine that probably doesn&#x27;t exist, so is there a way to do it from my end without requiring a ton of manual work?
 Thanks in advance for any help.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been a sysadmin for 6 years and started with a new company several weeks ago. It&#x27;s a similar role on paper but the environment, architecture, procedures and policies are very different. I&#x27;m having to refamiliarise myself with some basic skills and knowledge that I was educated on during uni but never had to apply in my previous role and also learning 100% new stuff which I feel like I probably should have already known? I feel like I&#x27;m pretty slow with the tasks I have been assigned and I&#x27;m feeling pretty dumb and useless. 
 My previous job was fresh out of uni so I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like to start as a &#x27;skilled professional&#x27; at a new company. Is it normal to feel like a fish out of water when you start with a new company doing a similar role or am I just an imposter that got lucky?

                              <span>Hello, I have a little problem with my centreon and I can&#x27;t find an answer anywhere.
 I need to monitor the veeam services on a vm windows server via my centreon poller on centos but there&#x27;s a problem, the centreon commands return this error: &quot;Status information UNKNOWN: SNMP Table Request: resourceUnavailable (This is likely an out-of-memory failure within the agent)&quot;.
 Here&#x27;s my command /usr/lib/centreon/plugins//centreon_windows_snmp.pl --plugin&#x3D;os::windows::snmp::plugin --mode&#x3D;service --hostname&#x3D;xxx --snmp-version&#x3D;&#x27;2c&#x27; --snmp-community&#x3D;xxx --service&#x3D;&#x27;Veeam Cloud Connect Service&#x27; --warning&#x3D; --critical&#x3D;1: --state&#x3D;&#x27;&#x27; --regexp
 I have already succeeded on other vm quite similar to monitor services so I think it is a problem with veeam. Does anyone have an idea please? Here to answer any question. Thanks a lot.

Do we have a guide, post, Wiki entry or similar on this?

 Please let me know what you think and whether or not you experience any bugs or issues. Thinking this could be a good way of using AI but still learning things more properly instead of just asking GPT to answer.
 It does not work like GPT but more as an AI docs searcher and thus have very limited creativity ability. Feel free to shoot over questions if you are curious about how I built it or similar things

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 ​
 I have a windows computer that perfectly receives it&#x27;s address from a windows DHCP server in our network. 
 When booting into a Linux OS with a live bootcd (USB) like Ubuntu, Debian, EndeavourOS, ... it all works perfectly and i receive the same IP from our DHCP server. 
 However, on the same computer i tried installing Arch Linux and i booted off the install medium like a normal Live CD but i never get any ip address.
 Arch sees the network card and indicates the interface is up but there is never a response from our DHCP server itself for this OS.
 MAC address is correctly detected and is correct in the DHCP server as well, that never changed.
 The following link shows you the DHCP request for Arch linux and EndeavourOS (Based on Arch).
 https://imgur.com/c3CxVtV
 Does anyone know why this happens and what i can do about it to solve this ?
 ​
 Many thanks !

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m working on deploying Hybrid Join for our windows computers in order to reduce the amount of separate logins users have to do for teams, onedrive, M365 services in browser etc. So far this seems promising.
 I&#x27;m searching for a way to find information about the tokens available within a session.
 For now, all I have is the &quot;SSO State&quot; information listed with dsregcmd /status. One thing I noticed is that the AzureAdPrtExpiryTime changes when you modify the Prt e.g. by adding and MFA claim.
 Could I get detailed information about which claims and accesses a user has at a given moment, either on the client or in the AAD console? This way I could performe detailed troubleshooting in the event of an unexpected login request.

                              <span>Hi,
 Been trying to find if this is even possible. We have a problem with end users directly contacting our helpdesk on Teams. Our helpdesk personel is getting somewhat annoyed by pointing users to the correct way of creating a ticket.
 This will of course not solve the issue, but some users do not know... and some do not really care. So it would at least help and inform the users.
 Is it possible for an administrator to submit a custom status message for a group of people in Teams? We would like to have the ability from the administrators perpective to change this message for all helpdesk users at once.

                              <span>Hello fellow admins!
 Im in the midst of setting upp Applocker and are currently in Auditing mode and seeing loads of .pyd files showing up as would be prevented from running if the policy were enforced.
 I&#x27;ve allowed all DLL&#x27;s signed by a trusted publisher, but this exception\Rule does not seem to apply to the .pyd files. And when creating rules for dll&#x27;s im unable to select .pyd files.
 Any guidance would be highly appreciated since my googlings haven&#x27;t resulted in much.

                              <span>Hi all,
 We recently got 30 users joining our organization and we want to enroll them in Intune / Autopilot. Our first step is upgrading their W11 home edition to pro so that we can apply the Windows 10/11 Enterprise E5 license and enroll them.
 ​
 We have contacted our Microsoft partner we currently get our licenses from and they quote 180 euro for a W11 pro license, retail pricing is 150 euro and the grey market (CD-keys, G2A, etc) is 15 euro. I have read that Microsoft volume licensing is an option but we don&#x27;t have access to that.
 The grey market option is attractive however I am worried that the keys might get deactivated in the future.
 Which option would be the best to upgrade 30 users from W11 home to pro?

                              <span>Hello all,
 we have a pretty weird problem with Exchange/Outlook. 
 Scenario: We are an international company (let&#x27;s call it contoso) with about 1800 employees spread over several countries in Europe. We have 1 domain and no domain trusts. Now we (contoso) have bought a company in Spain and this company should be integrated into our system. 
 Our infrastructure:
 - 2 physical Exchange Servers 2019 - which are up to date.
 - 2 virtual Exchange Server 2019 - which are also up to date
 - A Sophos SG Firewall - with a WAF configured for our exchange servers after best practice
 - Multible Domain Controllers
 - Office 2016
 Let me know if you need to know more about our infrastructure.
 What happened so far:
 - we bought the domain contoso-spain.com
 - we have created the domain autodiscover.co…</span>

                              <span>A thought struck me the other day as I was doing some housekeeping in our AD: How do people go about cleaning up and/or keeping their AD&#x27;s under control over the years?
 The backdrop for this question is that our AD is, when you go way back, originally from 2001. As such it&#x27;s seen its fair share of server-versions all the way up from WinSrv2000, and I&#x27;m still finding remnants of such ever now and then in the form of old built-in accounts, various groups and even the odd dead server or two that hasn&#x27;t been properly removed from the domain.
 How do people deal with this? Basically set up a new domain within the same forest and move what you want/need over, or do you spin up an entirely new forest with a new domain and then migrate things?

                              <span>Hey r/sysadmin :)
 I work for a small start up that is using a Synology for file storage. 5 users connecting from all over the world and having access to different folders on the NAS. Everything works fine and everyone is happy, but me. There are around 5TB of data on that Synology. I need an affordable &quot;Synology in the cloud&quot;. Where I can set users and access levels and have the data securely stored in the cloud. I also prefer a cloud in Europe - even better Germany - (privacy concerns) . What is the best practice for larger companies? I am very low on budget. I want to offer a solution that I feel safer with. (If the NAS fails - no one has access to data for several days)
 Thanks a lot guys

                              <span>This past March our company entered a contract with a provider that provides us with Microsoft E3 licenses. Along with this came some professional services that helped us finish an initial Intune rollout. 
 On call 4of6 with our rep, I casually asked about the impact of a domain loss and name change on our tenant. I fully expected this to be a softball (I was hired on as a level one guy), and that my VP or anyone in our C suite would have posed this question at the beginning of our contract. 
 My rep paused for a moment, knowing our situation with Intune, our current DC, etc. He basically said we might as well not even finish this call, and mentioned how little time we have. My heart sunk.
 Since starting at my company I have been trying to get us onto a more modern platform, one that is easier overall for our users.
 With all that being said, doing double MS e3 licenses for 7 months is a non starter for our leadership. 
 Problem: we have ~650 PCs on old DC, most of which are remote and our VPN solution is a) sophos ssl b) not widely used
 My proposed plan: New DC: All new/current gen pcs are enrolled We redistribute devices on new domain Users continue to use old e3 resources on devices (office licenses) until we are ready to roll out name change and new tenant
 We have to be out of using our old name and tenant Jan 1
 My question: is there any easier way than this?
 Just about anything is on the table as long as I can tangibly point to a labor savings, and make it as easy on our users as possible. We can probably even talk about switching back to o365 and use those savings for some other solution.
 Thanks for taking the time to help a bit with this

 I&#x27;m having an issue where a VM has nothing indexed and when rebuilding the index to include needed folders it finds 111 items and says indexing complete.
 Has someone encountered something similar and maybe you have a fix?

                              <span>Let&#x27;s say I&#x27;m administrating a server remotely (I have a VPS) from the cafe or co-working and I use an open Wi-Fi AP there. I know that my data that my devices receive and transmit can be listened and edited by another users (we remember that the network is open). I connect to a VPS using SSH. Is it secure enough or I should use the software like OpenVPN or make my own private AP using smartphone?

                              <span>Hi All, Im in the middle of a network refresh in our secondary data center and we are implementing Vxlan evpn fabric with Cisco n9ks. I am learning all I can in this short time before we deploy, but I can’t seem to find a good resource that explains how Broadcast unknown unicast and multicast traffic works in the overlay. Do I need to have multicast in the underlay (Pim sparse mode) in addition to mp-bgp evpn? It would seem that with evpn and arp suppression it wouldn’t be necessary. Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I’ve been trying to implement option 156 in KEA DHCP as outlined in this forum : 
 https://www.shoretelforums.com/forum/shoretel-tech/administrators/650-how-to-configure-option-156-in-linux-dhcpd
 The option has been defined as a string , and I set CSV to true, as I want multiple values to be sent to the clients.
 Unfortunately KEA doesn’t accept “array of strings” as a valid option and will not start.
 After removing the array line, predictably , only the first value is sent to the client and it appears to be a decimal string not a string the same way it was configured.
 Based off this guidance 
 https://ftp.ripe.net/mirrors/sites/ftp.isc.org/isc/kea/1.5.0/doc/kea-guide.html#dhcp4-custom-options
 I am hoping to specify the option as a “record” and specify multiple data types and pray it accepts it.
 Unfortunately I feel this won’t work because “When array is set to true and type is set to &quot;record&quot;, the last field is an array, i.e., it can contain more than one value ” will probably just complain about an array of strings again.

                              <span>Hello, I have setup route reflector and RR clients via GoBGP using l2vpn-evpn. I also have VTEP setup on the RR client server, for example - KVM - Bridge - Vxlan. This might be a stupid question, but could GoBGP automatically advertise the route if I attach a new KVM device to the bridge? Or do I have to manually advertise the routes via GoBGP cli? If it&#x27;s automatic, I would really appreciate a working example. I picked up GOBGP because it seemed really easy to use, but would FRR offer me more debugging functionality?

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 Sorry if this has been asked a million times.
 I&#x27;m quite new to BGP, I know that iBGP doesn&#x27;t change attributes mainly the next hop. How do Large ISPs generally configure their BGP networks?
 Would they have hundreds of routers within an iBGP AS, using route reflectors, changing editing the next-hop IP and injecting null routes to bring the BGP prefixes into the routing tables
 Or do they have hundreds of small iBGP AS&#x27;s with 5-6 routers inside all linked together using eBGP?
 The first way was how I did my EVE lab, but was getting tricky/lot of work to implement (around 15 routers).
 Or do they have another method that I haven&#x27;t thought of?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hey yall!
 I am a little confused and am just looking for some thoughts or feedback on an issue. I have a client that uses an iPhone 6 to stream Pandora in their workshop. The issue is, I can see the device is connected to the Unifi AP (U6-Pro) but the traffic going to and from the iPhone is... Pausing? Pandora loses connection and requires someone to turn the screen on and then it starts playing again.
 I have been pinging the device for a while and I can see there is traffic for a few seconds, like it&#x27;s checking in, then nothing for another few minutes. Now if someone actually goes and plays Pandora again it will ping for several minutes then the ping stops followed by the music, still connected to WiFi.
 My thought is that there is some kind of &quot;WiFi Pausing&quot; feature that doesn&#x27;t disconnect the WiFi but pauses the connection? It looks like it&#x27;s only 2 iOS devices doing this, all other devices remain consistently pingable.
 Device is iPhone 6 on iOS 12.5.7 - No Power Saving Options are on and the Phone is constantly plugged in.
 UAPSD is off
 Thank you in advance!

                              <span>I have a hard time understanding the distinction between EVI and VNI in an EVPN network. The below link says, EVI ID autogenerates with the same value as a VNID. I understand VNID is what distinguishes a VLAN on a local switch (so each VLAN is given a L2VNI which is the VNID). The VNID is what is needed to distinguish routes when a leaf advertises any type EVPN route to the fabric. But if EVI and VNID are same, why should there be two terms?

                              <span>Is there software readily available (commercial or open-source) that can manage the ACL configuration for devices it has authority over, simple enough that I could expose it to low-level technical users. For example, if I have a contractor who needs to allow access between two endpoints, he doesn&#x27;t necessarily need to know anything about those endpoints except their names (to select them from an object-list), configure the required ports etc in a web-form, then the software will determine where policies need adding, and add them.
 Assuming there&#x27;s already a source of truth configured, and I just need the ACL configuration and deployment bit.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a question about what certificates I should have on a new pair of HA Palo Alto 3320&#x27;s that I&#x27;m setting up, these are severing as our hosted WAN firewalls, we&#x27;ll be doing SSL inbound inspection on them.
 The main caveat is that the hosted servers that users go to when they go through our hosted NAT rules, are all F5 VIP&#x27;s, normally, I would just be putting the servers pub/priv key pair of the firewalls, but since none of them are technically where the user goes to when they establish an SSL connection, the F5 VIPs acts as the destination for the NAT rules whenever the hosting IP&#x27;s are connected to.
 It may seem like an obvious question, but in this case, don&#x27;t I just use the pub/priv keypair that are on the F5 client SSL profile instead of the servers certificates themselves in a normal instance?
 One bonus question as well, for the decryption policy on the PA, am I right in saying that the scr zone would be the outside, scr ip &quot;any&quot;, dst zone (the relevant next hop zone) and the dst ip as the private IP, being the VIP, not the public IP that users will connect to? (I guess the same sort of question applies to the NAT and security policy rules to, that&#x27;s how I&#x27;ve currently set it all up)
 Thanks all

                              <span>I am helping to build a GUI for users to configure network bonding on CentOS 6 machines. Networking is not my area of expertise though! Currently, it&#x27;s possible to create a bond with only a single network defined, and CentOS allows this. I can see how this might be useful during a configuration process, e.g. as a means of keeping bond settings around to copy from while configuring another, etc., but that&#x27;s just UI sugar.
 Is there any use case for keeping it this way? We&#x27;re trying to figure out if we want our GUI to even allow it. Our product owner thinks that CentOS accepting a single-interface configuration at all should be considered a bug in linux.

                              <span>Hello,
 This might be a stupid question... We are trying to upgrade from Cisco Prime Infrastructure 3.9.1 to 3.10.3. I have never done this and documents explain how to backup 3.9, uninstall it, then install 3.10 and restore the backup into it. But doesn&#x27;t explain which version to use that is available on their website? We are using a VM to run out Prime Infrastructure at the moment and are going to use VM for the new version. Which version of Prime Infrastructure do I need? I see these:
  
Cisco Prime Infrastructure 3.10 ISO image for the physical appliance. Run, openssl dgst -sha512 -verify CiscoPI3.10.pem -signature PI-APL-3.10.0.0.205-1-K9.iso.signature PI-APL-3.10.0.0.205-1-K9.iso from the command line.
 Cisco Prime Infrastructure 3.10 OVA for the virtual appliance
  
From the names alone, it tells me I need to download #2. Is that correct?

                              <span>Hive mind,
 My long loved MRV LX4000 series console servers have been declared officially unsustainable by both the vendor and my management.
 I&#x27;ve got 10 of the 32 port version in my staging facility.
 What&#x27;re folks using these days? I&#x27;m hoping for a one-to-one replacement so I can just plug and pray and not have to redesign my OOBM infrastructure. (edit: Must be DoD-compliant / able to meet DISA STIGs)
 Thanks!

                              <span>Our IT vendor (not under contract with) is pricing out a new firewall and switches. Ours (Fortinet) is coming to end of support.
 We own a small commercial building with a little more than 48 ports in the building. 15 or so go to our own company, and the rest of the building is for executive suites that we rent out to tenants. One tenant may be solo, and another may be 3-4 employees. So whatever product we use needs to be able to isolate the tenants to their own secure network. Beyond this, fairly intuitive interface, good security, and any other bells and whistles that may be beneficial to an executive suites building would be great.
 All that said, they are suggesting Sonicwall. I get the sense that this is just who they&#x27;ve been using for a long time. They speak highly of the product they put out... but I did a little reading on a few posts and found they don&#x27;t have the best reputation compared to others. Maybe in those instances it was for larger clients with different needs... I don&#x27;t know these devices are a little outside my expertise :)
 Our building is pretty high end and I&#x27;d like our networking capabilities we offer to tenants to reflect that as well. Is Sonicwall a good choice, or are there options that we should definitely consider over them?
 Thanks for any and all feedback and opinions.

                              <span>Wondering if anyone might have any tips on an issue I am having with a S2S VPN between a Cisco ASA and a WatchGuard. 
 I manage the WatchGuard. Remote side IT manages the Cisco ASA. 
 We&#x27;ve had Cisco TAC and WatchGuard Support involved extensively and they can&#x27;t figure it out. Initially they thought it was a stuck SA instance, but remote Network Admin has checked that this time around and are not seeing anything like that. 
 We have a total of 6 active tunnels, 5 out of the 6 are working flawlessly and are stable. The 6th one, the WatchGuard will SEND from my end, but does not receive anything back from the ASA. 
 I&#x27;ve been through my config a dozen times and cannot find anything that would be preventing return traffic. To me, it feels like the ASA might have a broken return route back to the WatchGuard&#x27;s network on that specific subnet. 
 I am aware of the reputation WatchGuard has in this subreddit. Replacing the WatchGuard is not an option and I really think WatchGuard has made some stellar improvements over the last 5 years or so and are solid UTM Appliances. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hello,
 I am doing research into starting my own ISP to resell wholesale fibre products. 
 I am in the planning stage at the moment however I have noticed that to become a BT Wholesale Customer I need an OFCOM RID number, however in order to get a RID number I need to show an agreement with a PECN (i.e. in this case BT). 
 My background is more sales and marketing and I have never done this before. I am in effect looking (initially) to &quot;white label&quot; the BT product which I believe is possible. 
 Any guidance on this or consultants who can help are welcome :) 
 Cheers.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t have a college degree, but I have a HS diploma. I work in IT as a senior network guy. I have been with my current role for a year now. I do not have issues with my colleagues, and I actually like it here. Also, my goal is to get a degree and some time-off/break/vacation.
 The issue that I have is the folks at different organizations/programs. Lets call them company A. Company A has been trying to take over our IT operation despite the contract between my program and theirs, which is just cybersecurity, and they are not even good at it.

                              <span>Hey all, I am currently stuck trying to get an additional subnet advertised and talking to Cisco AnyConnect users. I have limited knowledge of ASAs (have mostly worked with PA&#x27;s in past).
 Here is how the subnets are being defined in access-list.
 #show run access-list VPN-SplitTunnel
 access-list VPN-SplitTunnel standard permit 10.36.41.0 255.255.255.0
 access-list VPN-SplitTunnel standard permit 10.101.0.0 255.255.255.0 
 The problem is after a user connects to the VPN, the new route does not show up in Windows route table.
 Where else do I need to add a route, so the users can receive the route.
 TiA.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m not sure what open source package would suit my needs. We have a team of employees and volunteers spread across a few different business locations. They occasionally move from one location to another, and they tend to have very similar questions that our talent managers answer for them. I&#x27;m thinking something like resource management (or customer management, but used for employees?) along with a help desk. Are there any web-based solutions already built which might help us manage this? Preferably php/mysql?

                              <span>I got to the office this morning and someone from Finance asked me, &quot;Yo X, is our ERP up yet?&quot; I was confused. &quot;What do you mean, it&#x27;s up?&quot; She replied, &quot;You know, our ERP is down since 7.30 am.&quot;
 I checked and sure enough, our ERP was down. I panicked and started troubleshooting. The server was up and running, and the network was fine. I didn&#x27;t know what else to do, so I blamed our vendor. I sent them a WhatsApp message: &quot;Hey, what did you guys do? We can&#x27;t access our ERP.&quot; They replied, &quot;We didn&#x27;t do anything.&quot;
 I was at a loss. I continued troubleshooting, but people were starting to get angry and impatient. I remembered that our domain had expired on May 28, 2023, and today was June 2. The domain provider had auto-renewal enabled, but it was attached to one of our directors&#x27; credit cards. I called him, but he was still asleep. After 16 minutes of trying to wake him up, he finally renewed the domain. He mentioned that he forgot to change the card detail. 
 I waited patiently for the domain to come back up. My phone could access the ERP, but my laptop still couldn&#x27;t. I was about to start troubleshooting again when one of my managers said, &quot;Have you tried restarting DNS?&quot; I did, and it worked! Everyone was happy, and we hugged and celebrated.
 Just to share you my little achievement on Friyay morning

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 Im looking for recommendations on a solution that can retrieve and store logs from office365, salesforce, and our firewalls. I was looking at Datadog, and betterstack but not sure how well and how the pricing works. 
 For example: - The audit logs or sign in logs for all users in azure active directory. 
  
SharePoint auditing as well like document editing, deletion, etc
 
Firewall changes, logons, etc
 
any changes made in Salesforce
 
We also have other applications that we may be able to work with vendors or their API that we would like events logged

                              <span>Basically what the title says. I&#x27;ve had days where I got about zero sleep the previous night, for one reason or another, and I know that I&#x27;m not going to be a very useful human approximation at work. I&#x27;ve debated calling in and using a sick day, but I&#x27;ve refrained from doing so for two reasons:
 1) It wouldn&#x27;t help me feel any better. When morning rolls around, that&#x27;s it. I can&#x27;t nap during the day without completely spoiling sleep the next night unless I&#x27;m actually sick. I&#x27;m not going to be able to do anything, so I may as well feel miserable and get paid instead of feeling miserable for free.
 2) We&#x27;ve got a small team, and I wouldn&#x27;t want to let them down. I really like my compatriots, and if I&#x27;m out then my share of the work gets dropped square in their laps. If I can grab that phone call from the capo di tutti capi, that lets everyone else keep their concentration on what&#x27;s important.
 I know that these sound contradictory, but it&#x27;s a matter of taking the smaller tasks that don&#x27;t require as much brainpower - stuff I&#x27;ve done a hundred times and is mostly muscle memory at this point - and either passing the challenging stuff off or sending bland updates that extend my deadlines.
 Basically, I&#x27;m asking for advice/anecdotes/etc. Thank you.

                              <span>Sometimes I want one ping only. So I use this alias in bash on Linux:
 alias vasili&#x3D;&#x27;ping -n -c 1&#x27; 
 For Windows and CMD, you can use:
 DOSKEY VASILI&#x3D;PING -n 1 $* 
 For PowerShell, you&#x27;ll need a function:
 function vasili { ping -n 1 $args } 
 I legitimately use this when troubleshooting some kinds of connectivity issues, and want a simple controlled test.

                              <span>You are stressed and over worked, always dealing with issues and never just a routine check up. Majority of L3 task lands on your plate as there is no other L3 tech. Yet the overlord still expects average 10-15 tickets completed per tech each day, so you&#x27;re forced to handle L1 and L2 to meet your quota. 
 Clients will snap at you believing that with a click of a mouse you should make miracles happen because you work for Magical Solution Provider but unbeknownst to them it&#x27;s a place where Most Sanity Perishes. 
 Breaking point is near so you request for new L3 techs to be hired and gifted with a response from the overlord &quot;sure that&#x27;s already in the process.&quot; 
 They will hire a handful of new minions and to your surprise...only ONE new L3 that deals only with onboarding and the other new condemned souls now come to you for salvation with issues they can&#x27;t handle. 
 You will be asked for your input to diagnose a problem, which you will give but yet be asked &quot;did YOU fix it?&quot;
 You sit and stare at your screen with realization you&#x27;re happy on weekends but severely depressed during the weekdays with ideas of stepping out at lunch time and never returning. 
 Have you been in the same spot and what did you do?

                              <span>So the topic itself is vague-centric, hopefully I can keep the post itself on track. I&#x27;ll try to keep it short but I am a known tangent enjoyer. 
 First &#x27;proper(?)&#x27; job in IT, was working for a UK Telecoms company as Customer Service for many years before this role I took late last year.
 The role is IT Service Delivery Administrator. In case that flags anything up for anyone, I know of ITIL, not studied it myself but my manager is going to put me up for it as our new HoIT is keen on adopting a structure pointed more to ITIL than it currently is. 
 So currently, some of my roles and responsibilities include (but not limited to):
 Managing the provision and return of equipment to staff. It&#x27;s more managing the tickets and just checking with the MSP like &quot;hey, we all good for next week&#x27;s star…</span>

 It’s canigothere.zip

 Any advice on how to find/fix them, and or retribution.(I&#x27;m leaning towards changing their desktop to say WSUS Cheater and locking it for them)

 I&#x27;ve recently acquired a couple of AHA374b GZIP accelerators for my personal servers. These cards were released a while back by Comtech&#x27;s AHA Products Group and boasted impressive compression and decompression speeds.I was pretty excited about the potential they could bring to my setup.
 Unfortunately, these cards have reached their end-of-life/end-of-service status and Comtech is unable/unwilling to provide any access to the related software and drivers.I&#x27;m in need of:
  
Linux, Windows, and Open Solaris reference drivers with source code
 Drivers and Plug-ins for Apache Web Servers
  
I was wondering if any of you had experience with these accelerators and might have these resources archived or know where to find them. I understand this is a long shot, but any information or assistance would be greatly appreciated.
 Also, if you&#x27;ve used these accelerators or something similar before, I&#x27;d love to hear about your experiences – the good, the bad, and the ugly!
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Below is the update we got from engineering. Please review and let me know if you have any questions.
 Dell engineering team has provided an approved workaround to help mitigate, in most cases resolve, most short-term video loss with external monitors connected to your Dell docking station. This workaround involves a registry key designed to disable the Display Stream Compression (DSC) function which is used to increase the maximum available video bandwidth. Disabling DSC may have some negative impact to high-end, end user environments that are running 3 or more displays with higher resolutions or refresh rates such as 4k and above. We understand that having the full capabilities available for your hardware is important which is why we are positioning this registry key as a short-term work…</span>

 We are a company of medium size and we are looking for a PAM solution. We would like to scout the market and compare opensource and non-opensource solutions. 
 Currently a Teleport solution exist for a small scale of the company but we are looking for other possibilities. 
 Thank you for your recommendation :)

                              <span>We need to pickup a small amount of laptops for some of our sales staff. We are talking maybe 3-5. I&#x27;ve been researching several options from Lenovo, Dell, and now Samsung. 
 As of right now, the Samsung Book3 Pro looks like the biggest bang for the buck. For about the same price as 11th and 12th gen laptops from Lenovo and Dell, I can get a 13th gen EVO laptop from Samsung with a better screen and webcam (they&#x27;ll be using webcam quite a bit).
 I will say, I do personally own a Book3 for home use and really like it but it does come with a ton of Samsung bloat. But, that&#x27;s nothing a reimaging can&#x27;t fix.
 Has anyone delt with Samsung business, particularly their laptops, in their environment? If so, what has your experience been? Reliability, warranty replacement, support, etc...

                              <span>Sent a potential client an email with a PDF attachment from my email address last week. I waited a few days for response, then got on the phone with him to find out my email ended up in his spam folder.
 Kind of embarrassing but anyway... why spam?
 Info:
  
This is the first time I sent an email to the specific person&#x27;s email address (maybe attachment and first time sending flagged it, or my wording?)
 I have DKIM, SPF, and DMARC active. my (self hosted email) uses MailGun for outgoing mail. 
 I was curious if it may have went to spam possibly when I didn&#x27;t hear back for a few days, but I get DMARC reports daily and double checked the report on this message, all passed.
  
dmarc - https://imgur.com/aLUuKxp
 I never had any issues with MailGun&#x27;s rotating sending IP addresses (in dmarc report). Sent other emails recently to new addresses with attachments and they replied no problem. The only thing I can think of is maybe his I.T. admin has Outlook spam settings set ridiculously strict?
 I set up mail open/click tracking, which may help a a little (assuming receivers don&#x27;t have images blocked by default), but still curious why this may have happened.
 Thanks and I appreciate any ideas you share

                              <span>Just fishing for ideas here - we have a ye olde legacy environment that has some ancient Domain Controllers that we&#x27;re finally getting around to replacing.
 As it&#x27;s on an ancient environment the people who know about it have long gone so we&#x27;re doing a bit of homework first and we need to determine what&#x27;s actually using the DCs to work out what the risk is.
 I&#x27;m not overly concerned about the actual domain authentication itself as that&#x27;ll generally just work itself out, I&#x27;m mainly concerned about LDAP and DNS - is there anything else i&#x27;m overlooking here?
 I can turn on the LDAP event logging to identity anything doing LDAP queries, not so sure about capturing DNS queries though...the Windows stuff will be fine, it&#x27;s weird stuff like Wireless Access Points and other appliances i&#x27;m concerned about.
 Any other stuff i should be on the lookout for?

 &quot;Not only could every Ring employee and Ukraine-based third-party contractor access every customer’s videos (all of which were stored unencrypted on Ring’s network), but they could also readily download any customer’s videos and then view, share, or disclose those videos at will&quot;
 &quot;Although an engineer working on Ring’s floodlight camera might need access to some video data from outdoor devices, that engineer had unrestricted access to footage of the inside of customers’ bedrooms.”

                              <span>Hello,
 I have an HPE msa 2050 sas on which I have configured a sas connection with 3 hosts. Connections in the host tab showed up automatically. I connected the machines one by one (first the first port from controller A to the first host, port configuration on the device, then the first port from controller B to the first host, port configuration on the device, and then the next server). Connections look fine. From these hosts, I created a FOC group on the hpe msa 2050 and mapped the drives to this group. Then I set up a cluster failover on Windows Hyper-V 2019. Cluster passed the verification without errors, disks from the array connected without a problem, migration between machines works fine, but one thing worries me, when I run the get-initiatorport command in powershell on node 1 and node 3, it shows me nothing, while on node 2 it shows me all connections. It seems to me that on each server should be visible two connections and not all on one host. 
 Can someone confirm to me if the configuration on HPE is good or has anyone encountered something like this and is it normal?

                              <span>Hi guys, we have a Logitech Expansion Mic for Group and we&#x27;re struggling to set it up. The cable we need is 5sm too short. Are there any cable extensions available for it? Because from what I&#x27;ve seen, a 10-meter cable costs $150 USD. Is there any cheaper cable or extension that I can use?

 As you understand from title , If I set DisplayName attribute of Security Group in AD then Outlook Contact Card is showing Global Security Group (no mail-enabled security group).
 has anyone seen this before?
 Is it normal ? So expected behaviour?
 thanks,

                              <span>Hi guys have some question, i will be task to switch license (bulk) from teams room standard to pro due to change of license. Typically this is just a simple task below are the existing setting:
  
room account has been license explicitly and not using any grouping.
 license expiring soon
 purchase new license
  
My plan is to create a group and assign the license to the group in bulk. then once successful, remove the existing license. However, i understand that to avoid service interruptions, removal and assignment of license should be done on one command. Will i be running into some issue if i add first and remove license later?

                              <span>My team is currently trying to roll out passwordless MFA but are having issues with some users trying to enable phone sign-in inside the Microsoft Authenticator app. For some users, it works like a dream straight off the bat. For others though it is a real pain in the arse.
 We are going to the security info page to add an authentication method (Microsoft authenticator app). Once added we then enable passwordless phone sign-in. The app displays a two-digit number which is entered in and then the phone is registered. The app shows that passwordless sign-in is enabled. However, when a user tries to sign in for the first time, they receive a message stating &#x27;something has gone wrong on our side&#x27;. 
 Phone sign-in is then disabled and the user needs to re-enable phone sign-in to try again but this process seems to repeat after every login attempt, and we are unable to see why in the sign-in logs. 
 Users have either a Microsoft 365 Business Premium license or a Microsoft 365 Business Standard + Azure Active Directory Premium P1 License. They are also put into an MFA enablement group which is linked to a CAP. As I stated at the beginning some users it works like a dream, with no obvious differences in user setup. I would appreciate any insight you may have.

                              <span>Good Moring Admins, Looking for some advice in merging 2 file systems with windows server 2012r2 (i know, its been mentioned, plan is to upgrade in the coming months)
 Long short, we had a dr situation, new host has arrived, we have moved over the drives from a backup, but as the system cant have much down time, its about 24 hours out of date.
 So i attempted to use robocopy and a few others which all seem to fail and have the same issue. File path lengths and names.
 System has about 30 shares on it with stupid long paths, all of these programs tell me it cant copy because of length, there does not look like a way around this like there is with newer os version. 
 Can anyone advise a way around this.

 I tried to setup a Windows 10 domain joined machine with EDGE KIOSK MODE but it will not open the Web URL with SSO but when we setu the same on Chrome KIOSK mode it was possible to login to web URL via SSO.
 Is Edge chromium not supp SSO in KIOSK mode?

 ​
 For a customer i&#x27;d like to disable/grey out the possibility to change any VPN settings in the VPN settings panel in W11. Is there an existing setting to push this in Intune, or perhaps the possibility to push this via a OMA URI or script?

                              <span>Hello,
 im facing a really strange behavior with Server 2022 and RDP connections.
 Im running on VMWare ESXi 7.0 U2 with Server 2022 Datacenter. The problem occurs randomly on the servers and can be mostly forced by decreasing the hardware of the server to the minimum.
 Once i connect the following screen appears:
 https://imgur.com/a/xH4LtZQ
 checking the logs showing me a strange messages which not occour when the login succeeds. For eg:
 https://imgur.com/a/O1c1scZ
 On several hosts i moreover faced the problem showing a disconnected user using 50% of the CPU. Once i kill the high CPU process the session is killed
 https://imgur.com/a/VdQsxKa
 I appreciate any feedback or ideas to solve the issues. I already tried may things to rule out the problem such as deploying the image from a new clean iso, setting up the vm without domain join etc. Nothing yet helped me the locate the source of the issue.
 Regards

                              <span>Hi gang,
 Apologies if this is not quite on topic. We have an internal application. One function of that application is generating PDF reports generated in Crystal Reports from data in an MSSQL database. This is a fully automated process, no interaction required.
 At present the function calls an SQL query, gets a list of reports to generate, then starts generating them one at a time before &#x27;printing&#x27; them to a PDF file with the file name changed. This function currently utilises PDF995 which is slow and at times unreliable.
 This application (currently 32-bit written in VB4) is about to get an update to .NET and as part of this transition we want to move away from PDF995 and to something else we can &#x27;print&#x27; a PDF to and specify the output file name as part of the process.
 Wondering if anyone here has a similar set up or knows of one, and can recommend a replacement software product. I&#x27;m open to anything be it subscription or a once-off, as long as it&#x27;s regularly maintained and patched. TIA.

                              <span>Recently, our company moved the DNS server to AWS. 
 After that some of our users can not access the company website.
 They still can access any other website, however they can not access our company website. 
 And I found that all users who are having trouble are using Comcast as the ISP. 
 I did flushdns, delete cache, open with a different browser, modem/computer reset. but it didn&#x27;t work. 
 When I reached out to the Comcast customer service, they only talked about Modem Status. 
 Any Ideas ?
 Thank you.

                              <span>Retail SMB, 34 locations. Current equipment per location: EdgeRouter 4, UniFi Switch 24 (non-PoE), single UniFi NanoHD AP, 5G failover router, ~4-10 desktops, ~4-10 VoIP handsets, ~2-3 network printers, ~15-20 WiFi devices, camera NVR, traffic counter, digital signage, credit card machine.
 Current Specs: Internet varies from 200Mbps to 1Gbps (max) symmetrical fiber, 6 VLANs, 2 WiFi networks, port isolation. Locations are completely independent -- no interconnection between locations, no VPNs, no internal file shares, etc). No servers -- all hosted services and applications. No printing over WiFi. Short throw for AP&#x27;s -- long range not needed but WiFi speed is a priority. ~6-12 PoE capable devices: VoIP handsets, WiFi AP, traffic counter. Router cloud management - UISP via Ubiquiti (free). Switch/AP cloud management - UniFi controller via HostiFi ($50/mo).
 Current equipment has been pretty reliable overall. Never had a router go bad. Occasionally an AP/switch will disconnect from the controller and will have to be re-added via SSH.
 Would like to get a next gen firewall, PoE switch and WiFi 6 for each location, all cloud managed. Open to cloud firewall-as-a-service but don&#x27;t know much about them. Stick with Ubiquiti or not? What products/stack would you recommend?
 Have looked at Calyptix AccessEnforcer, Fortinet, and am intrigued by Firewalla Gold (bought a demo unit but haven&#x27;t plugged it in); Meraki Go line looks interesting. Open to suggestions.

                              <span>Hello All,
 I am working on redesigning the network layout in the local government building where I work. We currently have 3 network closets, the Basement and most of the first floor go to the IT office, The Tax office has its own network closet with a cat5e connection back to the IT office, and the 2nd floor has one also with a cat5e connection back to the IT office.
 I want to make a change and have 4 network closets with fiber links all back to the IT office
 finance (Basement)
 1st floor
 Tax
 2nd floor
 My question is what would be the benefit of having a fiber switch in the IT office connecting all the switches together VR just connecting the switches&#x27; SFP ports 
 Switches I will be using.
 JetStream 28-Port Gigabit Smart Switch with 24-Port PoE+ (port amount may very) 
 Fiber Switch
 TP-Link JetStream TL-SX3008F V1 - switch - 8 ports - managed
 ​
 Thank you for your insight 
 BIT

                              <span>I entered the technology field in 2020, working as a dev intern. I&#x27;ve always had a passion for computers, networks, and programming, and shortly after, I started working with DevOps. Since last year, I have been working as an AppSec Engineer.
 Although I enjoy the technical aspect, I see it more as a hobby. Honestly, I have never felt completely satisfied working in this area, and I have always aspired to move into a management or consulting role once I gained more experience.
 I enjoy working with people and I am quite sociable. I hold certifications such as CCNA, Security+, and CySA+. So my question is: am I still too inexperienced to transition into pre-sales?
 I often read that this role requires a lot of technical knowledge, but when would be the ideal time to make the change?
 TL;DR: I have 3 years of experience in tech (1 year as a developer intern and 1 year in cybersecurity). I am not satisfied with the technical work and want to transition into pre-sales. Do I still lack enough experience, or is it possible?

                              <span>I have been trying to understand usecase for secondary IP on an SVI, but looking up, I could find 2 reasons: migration and redundancy. I don&#x27;t see how redundancy is offered by having a secondary IP in that if the interface goes down, we loose both the primary and secondary IPs right? Is there something I am missing?

                              <span>Hello Network Gurus,
 Has anyone had any experience with building IPSec tunnels on Palo Alto firewalls and then trying to send multicast traffic through them? Specifically I am talking about the Speakerbus appliance used in the securities/stock trading industry. We are having the absolute worst time where nothing we try works. We&#x27;ve tried GRE over IPSec, changing MTUs, convert rules to Any/Any, reviewing logs but nothing seems to be giving us a clue as to where traffic is being dropped. 
 Could definitely use some help/advice.

                              <span>Hi Everyone,
 I have a Meraki deployment for SDWAN/edge firewall at my remote sites. I want to explore other options. Who have you all used and who do you like? Is Palo Alto or Fortigate any good?
 I would prefer one that can do segmentation on the LAN and separate rulesets per Vlan or interface. Cloud-managed would be nice too.

                              <span>Hello r/networking
 I might be late to the 100G train but here I am. I have a NAS shipping with 100G Aruba HPE 100Gb QSFP28 MPO SR4 100m Transceiver SKU# 845966-B21
 From my research this is has an MPO-12 connector. 
 For the switch side, I had purchased AMQ28-SR4-M1 transceivers (10Gtek, I already have good experience with their 10G model) which apparently have an MPO-8 connector.
 Following further research, I found out that MPO-12 has 4 fibers in the middle that aren&#x27;t used, thus only 8 fibers are needed.
 My obvious question is, do these 2 transceivers work together? What type of cable is needed?

                              <span>Our WAN has been upgraded to 10G fiber but the LAN runs from an existing managed 1G switch. Is there any upside to connecting all 4 1G ports on the router to the switch and configuring link aggregation?

                              <span>Check this out:
 Intel NIC Family Version 21.5.0 Firmware for X710, XXV710, and XL710 adapters - 9th Nov 2022
 https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-au/drivers/driversdetails?driverid&#x3D;gxj5g
 iSCSI Boot
 Previous version: v3.1.80
 Current release: v3.1.80
 vs the current latest (at time of posting):
 Intel NIC Family Version 22.0.0 Firmware for X710, XXV710, and XL710 adapters - 10th Apr 2023
 https://www.dell.com/support/home/en-au/drivers/driversdetails?driverid&#x3D;gxj5g
 iSCSI Boot
 Previous version: v3.1.80
 Current release: N/A
 Similarly for the latest &quot;Intel NIC Family Version 22.0.0 Firmware for I350, I354, X520, and X550&quot; also released 10th Apr 2023, where the previous version was v3.1.80 and current is N/A.
 I have firmware upgraded a &quot;Intel(R) Ethernet 10G 4P X710/I350 rNDC&quot; and a &quot;Intel(R) Gigabit 4P I350-t Adapter&quot; and confirm that the iSCSI Boot Option ROM disappeared after upgrading versions 20.5.0 &gt;&gt; 22.0.0 on both cards.
 I would imagine that iSCSI Boot is still supported perhaps, but how would one configure it and see settings? It&#x27;s strange that there&#x27;s no other mention of this at all in the release notes, other than the current release being &quot;N/A&quot;.
 I am not currently using this functionality but have in the past. It&#x27;s quite concerning when features just disappear with no explanation or justification!!

 It says the vulnerability has the capability of escalated privileges and potential unwanted unauthorised access?

                              <span>Today a non-tech C-Level Officer ask me to give him back Super Admin in Google Workspace to view the users calendar. When I joined I removed all the Super Admins for all non technical users because we all now Super Admin Permissions are powerfull.
 Now he stil ask and says Give me Super Admin then. Sadly Google Does not offer am role that allows the view of all users calendars.
 Any ideas how I should react? Do you guys haveing any tips?

                              <span>I am finally leaving the terrible, dumpster fire company I work for. I am a one person IT department. I haven&#x27;t told them I&#x27;m leaving yet, going to give 3 weeks notice when I do, and offer remote support for a short period of time in order to smoothly transition my replacement. I have nothing bad to say about my coworkers, the job is just genuinely burning me out and altering my mental health. I need to leave. 
 Before I give my notice, I am preparing extensive and updated documentation to give my replacement. This company had NO documentation post-2017 since I started, so it&#x27;s a lot of updating that stuff too. I&#x27;m basically doing it all from scratch so the new guy isn&#x27;t fucked like I was. 
 So, r/sysadmin, what stuff am I forgetting to put in there? I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s something. Write down every base I need to cover so I literally don&#x27;t forget anything.

 ChatGPT flat out refused saying &quot;I cannot provide a script that performs such actions.&quot;
 Bard delivered a script to salt the earth.
 Anyone else using AI for script generation? What are the best engines for scripting?

 Any ideas?

                              <span>Got an email sent to our former Network Administrator from a CDW email address over the holiday weekend that sounded like a catch up / sales call request for a phone meeting. I responded politely to advise that the former Administrator was no longer with the company in our IT department and that we were perfectly happy with our current adobe creative suite licensing in the portal and had no plans to add additional licenses or remove any currently allocated licenses. Thought that was the end of it, I periodically get this type of email from current or former vendors we do or have done business with in the past. I got a response with another email that had been CCed telling me to refer to the linked items for our licensing agreement and that this was not a sales email and the meeting and Audit are required.
 Apparently they haven&#x27;t been doing audits the past seven years and now they&#x27;re doing them again.
 We only have a small number of licensed users with the full adobe creative suite which is licensed through their portal user accounts, and each user has a single activated computer or laptop (marketing team members who do graphics or video editing).
 Has anyone been able to professionally and politely tell these guys to go pound sand?
 I didn&#x27;t care much for the prickly response from them. Had they worded their original email different and told me it was time for a mandatory audit to begin with I would have responded accordingly. The times they requested for possible dates for the meeting fall during my vacation cruise and I handed it off to our IT director to schedule and have the meeting.
 I am pretty sure this isn&#x27;t a scam, but it sure feels that way.

                              <span>For energy saving reasons, we use Wake on Lan on our backup server so that it&#x27;s only running when it needs to. This one and the main server are connected to a managed switch and both systems are in the same vlan. We have this setup at two different locations, only using different parts.
 At one of the locations, we discovered that network speed in that vlan slows down drastically when the backup server is shut down. After a lot more testing, we found out that this problem occurs with any NIC that is connected in 10Mb/s mode (tested 3 different systems, turned on and off, and manual 10Mb/s and 1000Mb/s mode, both full and half duplex, same problem every time). It&#x27;s a KGS-1604 switch from KTI Networks. At the other location, using a TL-SG108E from TP-Link, we couldn&#x27;t reproduce that behaviour.
 Sure, we could just replace the switch, but we&#x27;re just some 10th graders from Germany, doing some tech stuff mostly for fun and getting some knowledge in IT along the way, therefore we don&#x27;t exactly have a lot of budget. Most of our hardware was gifted to us or bought very cheaply from neighbours.
 But even if this is not fixable, we would like to know how this could even be?
 ​
 EDIT: Yeah time to say goodbye to that piece of shit, thanks for your advice guys, guess I learned a lesson today: NOT to buy THAT old hardware, no matter how cheap it is.

                              <span>For the longest time at any job I’ve been at, the buck stopped with me. I was always the most knowledgeable on the systems and was able to quickly determine the issue and fix the problem or tell the help desk crew how to fix it. The company is growing, and while I am still the senior engineer for all of the servers and infrastructure, I am being told to start looping in other help desk people in on new systems. The thought is to push the mundane, low hanging tasks to the help desk and keep me doing the architecting and high level tasks. I know that it’s a good thing, for both myself and the members of the help desk, but I feel that I am losing control and won’t be able to be the knowledgeable one anymore.
 How have you gotten past this and been able to be at ease?

I run my clients through SpamTitan for email spam and phishing support. One of my clients is currently not receiving any Forgot Password emails or MFA code emails. Nothing is showing up in either the SpamTitan logs or the Exchange Online message trace. I&#x27;ve contacted the vendors and spoken with them *as they were sending the emails out*, and we have not received anything, nor have they shown up in logs. Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Anyone have any ideas? I&#x27;m at a complete loss right now.

I was wondering are there any services that we can look inti which offer to store and manage the laptops in our behalf . I&#x27;ve already checked into Hofy but it cannot entirely solve our problems as we want to be able to have the laptops as our property. So we are looking for something or someone with a business that stores the laptops and receives them from employees leaving and gives them to new hires.

                              <span>Hi! I have the task to implement GCPW for all our windows devices.
 We&#x27;ll be using it for some extra security, easier remote work etc for 80-100 users that work remotely. 
 So my question now is, how would I go forward with rolling out this update to my users? 
 I don&#x27;t want them all to download the GCPW client themselves and install, neither do I want to do it for them manually, one by one. 
 We have no device management where we can roll out software. All our computers are just set up as a normal PC. 
 Would it be smart to write a powershell script that will download the GCPW client and install? 
 I pray that you, the sysgods have a solution, thanks!

                              <span>The April 2023 Epyc 2nd gen revision guide has errata #1474:
 Description
 A core will fail to exit CC6 after about 1044 days after the last system reset. The time of failure may vary depending on the spread spectrum and REFCLK frequency.
 Potential Effect on System
 A core will hang.
 Suggested Workaround
 Either disable CC6 or reboot system before the projected time of failure.
 Fix Planned
 No fix planned
 Despite what they say, the problem actually manifests at 1042.5 days. The TSC ticks at 2800 MHz, and 2800 * 10**6 * 1042.5 days almost equals 0x380000000000000, which has too many zeros not to be a coincidence.
 Note that your server will almost definitely hang, requiring a physical (or IPMI) reboot, because no interrupts, including NMIs, can be delivered to the zombie cores: this means no scheduler, no IPIs, nothing will work.
 Either disable the CC6 (as you did with the Zen CPUs IIRC), or just reboot the damn thing, it&#x27;s been three years already, you&#x27;re missing out on a lot of security patches.
 Please read erratas before you start digging, it&#x27;ll save you at least a day of debugging :(

                              <span>The offline root CA and the online enterprise CA both are virtualized. The enterprise issuing CA will be running in AWS as an EC2.
 Since they will not be installed on a physical servers and not even on the local on premises network, we cannot use the somewhat low cost YubiHSM that you can plug into a physical USB port. AWS has a Cloud HSM that we may be able to use with a EC2, but it’s about $1300 per month.
 So, assuming using an HSM is not possible, what can you do to secure the private keys as much as is practically possible? Just lock away the offline root, limit the network connectivity to the enterprise CA to minimums needed to function and limit the accounts that have access to the online enterprise CA with permissions to view or export the private keys (local admin rights)?

                              <span>Hey everyone. I’m trying to disable Windows sign in using PIN and leaving only the username and password but everything I’ve done so far doesn’t seem to work. Long story short, client recently enabled Azure AD sync and all of their PCs started asking for PIN set up upon sign in next morning. They don’t want to use PIN and only a password and I’m not sure where PIN requirement came from.
 I assumed it was due to Windows Hello for Business feature in Azure AD so I disabled it. Only 7 computers have been set up with a PIN and I’m trying to switch back to passwords.
 The computers are unmanaged in Azure. I have tried disabling all policies on affected machines that have anything to do with a password (Logon PIN, Windows Hello for Business). Also disabled “sign in options” registry key.
 After doing all that upon login certain users are still prompted for a PIN. I think it has something to do with Azure since they are Azure AD synced and my admin account is not so I never getting prompted but I just can’t find what’s enabled.
 Any help would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hello influential minds that are smarter than me,
 The company I work for is about 400 + company and has people onboarding and offboarding frequently. The previous admin had us doing manual Outlook emails to personal email addresses. The issue is that from time to time someone forgets to change the UN email in the template that we send out and it makes the department look bad.
 is there any way to automate welcome emails with specific attachments, we are an MS Tennent and use a third party licensor for our scheme called Appriver. Shot in the dark but just thought I would ask

Everything seems to be working OK with that; however, I didn&#x27;t really think about if there&#x27;s anything we need to do when a user incorrectly reports a message. I sent out a phishing sim a couple weeks ago and now the users are all hyper sensitive. I don&#x27;t want to misclassify ham as spam...used to be a big problem when we used Bayesian filters if we trained them wrong.
 Thoughts?

                              <span>It will be 2nd month as a associate sysadmin.Just to be clear there is no Senior sysadmin so i am responsible for all the tasks and tickets. They won&#x27;t take my advice on IT change like deciding which brand laptop for new joining but want me to mail the financial team on new laptop which they decide. After hiring here are the things i have done. Setup the fully functioning Ticketing system, Set of Assets management services which thanks to you guys i make them to use Snipe IT, Handle all the day to day task like fixing printer, access management. Since all things are cloud based so there is no AD to manage even though i deeply want to learn AD to myself more useful for future. Keep track of Assets. Change windows os, change battery of mouse. Hand jira related task since i am the global admin. I am getting more frustrated with day passes by. I choose to be sysadmin because of this reddit not joking.220$ is not enough to sustain a month even though dollar exchange rate is high here.If they only increase my pay to $400 it would be enough for myself to sustain a month.Also they promise me i would be provided with course i wanna join but turns out i am not getting any.

                              <span>Hi All,
 We host internally a document management system and the creators of this system offer an externally hosted solution to allow us to share our documents to customers/3rd parties via a web portal (in loose terms).
 Now I&#x27;ve been tasked with configuring this (I&#x27;ve already voiced my concerns that exposing anything to internet is a bad idea but here we are). 
 The system sits inside our lan, behind a watchguard firewall, internally it&#x27;s running IIS, I need a real world address to resolve to this internal website (i have a dns record setup pointing to our edge IP), I only want to allow one IP external address (or DNS) incoming to access this web server (hoping to make it as secure as possible).
 Would a simple 1 to 1 nat rule suffice, or is there a better smarter way of doing this?

 RANT WARNING: 
 We use Teamviewer for remote support as well as patch management and remote scripting. 
 Converting clients to the newly updated interface is longwinded when it works, but lots of our devices have failed to update with no explanation as to why. 
 The clients listed in the management console application only seem to show up half the time. And often assett lists fail to load anything at all. 
 Adding to all this the navigation is very unintuituive. It took me 5 minutes to find where to execute a script. It is done from the list of company devices and hidden under a drop down, not the remote scripting tab (why??????). 
 Congratulations TeamViewer, you have turned a mediocre patch management system into a terrible one. I&#x27;m open to change, but your UI is now utter garbage. 
 Thank god our contract is up for renewal in a few months.

                              <span>My whole career has been in IT. Started out repairing computers in 1991 and worked up to an IT Manager overseeing a large public organization’s infrastructure. I&#x27;m basically just a &quot;crusty old Cisco guy&quot; when you get right down to it. I&#x27;m likely older than a lot of folks on here (51) with about five years left before I can retire. I&#x27;m curious to know if anyone in my shoes has ever made the switch from IT to a &quot;real&quot; job? 
 We have an Energy Manager position opening up later this summer. My degree (from 1993) is in Electrical Engineering. I&#x27;ve worked on enough Facilities projects over the years that I could likely put together a good enough functional resume to at least sit an interview. Honestly though, as weird as this sounds, I&#x27;m not sure what people outside IT really do? The thought of not being responsible 24x7x365 for umpteen thousands of end-users seems a bit surreal. Not thanklessly fielding after-hours calls, giving up PTO because of unexpected issues/projects, or measuring success with anything other than network uptime all seem like foreign concepts to me. 
 If you&#x27;ve left IT after a substantial period, what were some of the things that surprised you? Would you share some of your experience with me on that transition? Thanks in advance to anyone that responds and hope everyone has a good day.

                              <span>This happened this morning, i came to work. Checked my e-mail to see a new question had appeared. Someone had gotten a phishing e-mail and asked if it was legit; spolier it wasnt. So i quickly respond to him: «No thats a phishing email, just report it.» Not thinking about it anymore, maybe 1 hour goes by or so and i recieve another e-mail, me not paying attention manage to open the attatchment from the previous mentioned e-mail. It took 1.1 ms to register what i had just done, it didnt even manage go load up before i managed to close it.
 Seeing as i have no idea what was contained in that file i had to go through the entire checklist
 Virus scan
 Reset passwords of other accounts which have been used on that computer/browser
 Check network logg
 Check registry logg
 Reinstall Windows.
 My biggest fear was that i was logged into Intune on an admin account if they could have hijacked the session.
 I sent the contents of the file to someone who could deobfuscate it:
 It just redirected you to a phishing website, no hidden malware.
 TLDR; Opened a phishing attachment and had to reset a lot of passwords and reinstall windows.
 Always pay attention, missclicks happen. And always delete emails containing phishing files/malware.

                              <span>Hi there, i have a customer with Intune Managed Devices which are connected to a OnPrem Exchange hosted on our end. The problem now is, that as soon as we set a shared Mailbox to auto connect to User Mailboxes the Shared Mailbox connects to the Users Outlook Profile, but than starts requesting a Password even if the user has full access to the Shared Mailbox. If we turn off auto connect for that Shared MB and add it manually to the Users Outlook, there will be no PW request at all. We tried, cleaning old PW locally and also recreated the Outlook Profile without any luck. The same happens also with a non domain/non Intune Managed Private device. Anyone has an idea where that behavior is coming from? Thank you very much guys!

                              <span>If you rename the PC after joining, looking up the user still shows the old name for the device. One way to fix is dsregcmd /forcerecovery requires you to sign in again, basically unjoins &amp; rejoins the user [a leave and join in one step so you aren&#x27;t left dangling outside the domain without an admin account]. 
 The simpler command dsregcmd /UpdateDevice made the PC name change propagate to Azure!

 We have some CAD software that&#x27;s MAC Locked and also protected by a USB dongle. I know how to sort this in Hyper V but I am having zero luck getting USB to work. The Dell servers are all in Lockdown mode for IdRAC - Not sure if this disables USB. Additionally, I cant find a setting to allow USB passthru in Windows Admin Centre. I&#x27;ve tried connecting with Hyper-V manager directly to one of the nodes but this fails.
 Any Ideas?

                              <span>We haven&#x27;t gone too in-depth with proper foresight into getting our Active Directory into tip-top shape. Now we need to really revisit how we have structured our AD OUs in a much better way. From a top-level OU structure, we are planning to have the DC site location with the structure as -
 Site-Location:
 OU Level 1- Building/Office 
 OU Level 2 --Department
 OU Level 3 ---Users/Computers
 We have some challenges here and not sure if the above structure will work:
  
Some buildings/offices may have a mixture of different departments that exist in other buildings/offices in the same site.
 Some users may be in multiple departments, so should we create all department containers in all buildings/offices as a pre-step to avoid extra work in the future?
 Some &quot;special category&quot; computer group policies we have applied to specific department machines which should not apply to all departments, would it be wise to create OU Level 4 for these machines? Specific policies are for example: Exceptions to Windows Screen lock-out, Allowing phones to be tethered to CPUs, Allowing USB access. This would create the GPO mapping side to be a little more tedious for us. So trying to prevent as much work as possible here.
  
Any suggestions on proper structuring from AD Veterans would help. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I am in the process to learn MS Azure SC-300 Microsoft Identity and Access Administrator for my certificate and i was wondering:
 Almost everyone I know uses username + password + 2fa code at once OR username + password &gt; 2fa code.
 Lets say a hacker tries to get in with username and password. Since the 2fa comes later, it is possible for him to know, if the password he brute forced is right or not...?
 Why dont organisations do username &gt; 2fa code &gt; password?
 So they wont know if the pw was right or not and 2fa code is changing all the time anyway?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I posted about it recently but I believe i didńt explain myself properly due to the answers received. Here is a second try 
 Good morning everyone! Let me pic your brain. I have a situation where we need to access (provide support) to different customers but many of them refuse to have an active connection.
 Let me explain better, we need to be able to dial into windows machines on our customer networks but they refuse to have a site to site VPN, client to site, team viewer, RDP etc… they want to have an in demand solution where we only access when they allow us to. Quick support isn’t an option as we cant control the device per se. Wouldn’t it be cool if we could do that natively?
 I am trying to get my head around it but any ideas would be more than welcome

                              <span>Hi everybody!
 ​
 I have an strange issue i cant find much information about on the internet.
 I did a dhcp / print server migration a couple of days ago on 2 locations.
 Exported the dhcp settings with powershell and imported to new one.
 DHCP is working fine , and clients are getting IP:s from the new servers.
 The servers are authorized and i can see them in the list of authorized servers.
 After the migration i cant see any scopes anymore (this worked before migration) , only on one location (1 out of 6) and thats the head office dhcp server.
 Red &quot;Stop sign&quot; over the dhcp server and says &quot;There are no items to show in this view&quot;.
 I can see the scopes locally on the server but not from my own computer with RSAT tools.
 ​
 I´ve tried running as different users / run as admin.
 Rebooted servers.
 Reauthorized DHCP servers.
 ​
 But still no luck. Anyone know what could cause this?

 What are the risks in your opinion, for a rgpd ruled company so no company data can normally go to the SOC company ?

                              <span>Hi All,
 I have been asked to assist with configuring some SPAN/RSPAN ports, and while I&#x27;ve done some basic SPAN configuration before, this project is quite large. The project covers 4 different facilities and quite large networks. We&#x27;re still a little ways out from configuration, but I&#x27;m trying to do some homework so I&#x27;m more prepared when we get to configuration.
 The basic SPAN/RSPAN stuff seems fairly simple and straightforward, but I guess what I&#x27;m struggling to find is any documentation or literature on how to properly &quot;place&quot; SPAN and RSPAN ports/configuration. Mostly just some considerations or best practices for properly and efficiently designing a SPAN/RSPAN configuration. If anyone has any resources, please share!
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hello,
 I was hoping to get some opinions for a situation I can&#x27;t seem to explain to some of our datacenter folks.
 I help implement and maintain our company&#x27;s large private backbone/MPLS Network (let&#x27;s call this out enterprise environment). We have two Datacenters utilizing Cisco ACI with 100G DCI between them. I&#x27;m not a data center guy, I&#x27;m a transport/radio guy.
 My task is to properly connect the MPLS environment to the two Datacenters. (Currently only commented via legacy DC equipment at one Datacenter only) this task wasnt completed by our senior in 3 years they had to do it and now that person is gone so I&#x27;m up.
 My thought is to connect to each DC via EBGP where my MPLS nodes are AS1 and the DC environments are AS2-5 (vPC pairs with separate AS numbers. Idk If that&#x27;s good design, I didn&#x27;t set it up and I don&#x27;t know DC/ACI. I&#x27;d almost think each vPC pair would share an AS but have separate AS per DC.)
 Regardless, I&#x27;d set route policies to only allow DC to DC traffic to traverse the DCI and any user traffic. From DCA site to DC2 site would traverse the MPLS backbone.
 What general approach would you all take to this? I can provide more details if needed just let me know. 
 Thanks

                              <span>I have a client that has their Office365 tools in a cloud instance with whitelisting. In order to whitelist IPs for our remote workers we have to split tunnel that MS Traffic in to exit our ISP for the whitelisting. 
 I&#x27;m using Palo Alto Global Protect and domain forwarding to accomplish this since there are regional IPs all over and VPN users all over. 
 I&#x27;ve basically added every domain found here: 
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/urls-and-ip-address-ranges?view&#x3D;o365-worldwide#skype-for-business-online-and-microsoft-teams
 This seems to work for the whitelisting, I can see the traffic come in and out and it satisfies the client logon. However active Outlook and Teams sessions seem to go offline and can&#x27;t show online anymore. I&#x27;ve gone through all sorts of logs and captures and so far I haven&#x27;t been able to narrow down what and why this is happening. Nothing is getting blocked so the only thing I can think of so far is that there is some traffic that is getting missed (either not on the urls listed above, or direct IPs not getting DNS resolved) and splitting the traffic between two egress points causing the session issues. I&#x27;m trying to get something setup to where I can test and capture myself so I don&#x27;t have to rely on client interactions but for now I thought I&#x27;d see if anyone has run into this issue. 
 I&#x27;m wondering if there are less domains I can split just for the login and leave all the others.

 I wanted to ask if I can transfer IPv4 Broadcasts and Unicasts over IPv6 adresses via a 4over6 Tunnel if the two clients don&#x27;t have native IPv4.
 If yes is there a builtin powershell command for creating such a tunnel on windows os?
 For example in Linux it can be done like this.
 /sbin/ip tunnel add  mode ip4ip6 remote  local  /sbin/ip -6 tunnel add ip6tnl1 mode ip4ip6 remote  local  /sbin/ip link set dev ip6tnl1 up /sbin/ip -6 route add 
 dev ip6tnl1 metric 1

Our WUG setup predates me, but since I&#x27;ve started we&#x27;ve begun to use NetBox as our source of truth. I&#x27;d like to setup a custom link so that when we view devices in NetBox, there&#x27;s a link to the same device in WUG. My problem is that I can&#x27;t really seem to find any consistent URL convention that will link to WUG; it seems like any links I try always go to the device I last logged into. Fwiw, we are running the 2021 edition. If anyone has any insight on where this is possible, I&#x27;d appreciate it.

                              <span>Quick question:
 If I have a 100GB QSFP with an MPO cable breaking out into 4x LC cables, if I only connect one leg would it be correct to assume the max bandwidth I can achieve is 25gb?
 Same with 400gb QSFP breaking out into 4x LC cables. Max bandwidth being 100gb unless I use multiple legs. 
 Is this correct or am I making an incorrect assumption here?

 I am looking for a reseller that offers 1U or 2U in Equinix&#x27;s ecosystem in Ashburn. Preferably in DC4, but any other locations on their campus would be fine. 
 Does anyone have a positive experience they can share with a reseller in DC4 or other Equinix facilities in Ashburn?

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m playing around with my datacenter lab environment and stumbled upon a problem. Lets say my ISP gave me the IPs 192.0.2.10-192.0.2.20 in the 192.0.2.0/24 subnet (192.0.2.1 is the gateway).
 I want to route 192.0.2.11-192.0.2.20 over 192.0.2.10. Sadly I cannot add a route to the gateway statically or with something like bgp. 
 If I assign the IPs to the router, it doesn&#x27;t forward the packets because they are (from the routers perspective) at the destination.
 If I use KeepaliveD to fill the ARP Cache of the Gateway and then remove the address from the interface it works until the cache gets cleared. 
 The Router runs VyOS (a Debian based Firewall / Router). 
 Any Ideas and Tips are welcome :)

 I have asked drei.at , hot.at, magenta.at but no one of them could provide me the details.
 ISP drei and hot told me that they don&#x27;t provide ipv6 in the year 2023.
 Do you have any alterntives?

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 We have been dealing with some issues regarding throughput on our 6e APs, leveraging the 6GHz spectrum. We are using a mix of Aruba 635 (2x2) and 655 (4x4) APs. Each AP offers 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz. We are also using the Cloud controller (Aruba Central, on v8.10.0.6_86193, tested with latest 8.10.x as well).
 We&#x27;ve configured a test SSID as we have begun deploying more 6e devices. We&#x27;re seeing roughly half the throughput on the 6GHz as we see on the 5GHz radio with the same clients, running speed tests and iperf to local destinations (as well as Internet Speed Test reflecting the same). We see this throughput loss across 40MHz, 80MHz and 160MHz wide channels (it scales up as you&#x27;d expect with the increased widths, but we still see ~50% loss of throughput compared to 5GHz). …</span>

                              <span>I have an old slingbox that tries to reach out to the internet for connection to download configuration data several times a minute. This configuration data will brick the slingbox so it is not wanted. 
 I see two solutions. One is to have a packet drop rule at the firewall to drop all these packets from the slingbox. I’ve tried this and it works but I hate the excessive logging. 
 The second solution is to set a dummy gateway in the slingbox gateway field. Unfortunately the device would not let me set 127.0.0.1 and I had to pick a unused ip on the lan. This works great. Nothing is logged on the firewall and I can access the device from the lan as I don’t need internet access to it. 
 So my question is from a network perspective. I’m assuming the dummy gateway on the slingbox to an ip not used on the lan will create additional arp request looking for it every time the slingbox tries to connect to internet for its bad config data via that dummy gateway.
 What would have the least network impact. The dummy gateway method or using the real firewall gateway and dropping all packets to internet?
 I’m assuming the dummy gateway method would free up any logging and load on the firewall but at the expense of broadcast additional arp request looking for the unused gateway ip. 
 So what’s the better solution?

I&#x27;ve read that it&#x27;s difficult to tell a good traffics and the bad traffics in TCP/UDP fragmentations attack.
 Is it possible to drop any incoming traffic to a certain IP that&#x27;s fragmented in Mikrotik Router? We want to find out if the service will still work correctly or not if we dropped fragmentation traffics to said IP. I&#x27;ve tried to google this, but either it&#x27;s not common practice or i&#x27;m not googling enough.
 My english is very limited so i might have used some uncommon terms there but i guess it&#x27;s still understandable.

 I&#x27;ve been tasked with setting up some VLANs for a customer environment, and they use exclusively a digital phone system on their workstations instead of having physical phones on the desk. My general understanding is that in a setup with a physical phone you would send untagged traffic from the workstation and tag the voice traffic from the phone, and then they&#x27;ll stay separated over the trunk link back to the switch, but I&#x27;m unsure how to implement this when it&#x27;s just a single link between the workstation and switch - is it even possible? 
 Any tips would be greatly appreciated :)

                              <span>I feel that this is a dumb question, but can a layer 2 network switch prevent devices connected to it (not the management port) from being accessible on SSH, telnet, HTTPS, etc? From my understanding this is layer 7 stuff and a layer 2 switch would be oblivious to it. However, we&#x27;re having issues after a server was moved, it&#x27;s pingable, you can access port HTTPS which you get a &quot;Page Forbidden&quot;, but that is the server replying at the end of the day. My argument is that the switches are configured properly, all servers are pingable, anything else would be at the application level, AKA on the server.

                              <span>Today me and one of my colleague ran into argument how often people use loseless protocols (DCBx in this case)versus lossy protocols. So trying to see how people many use DCBx in actual DC. If yes what overlay protocols you use NFS,CIFS,iSCSI etc ?

                              <span>Hello everyone. I&#x27;ve run into an interesting/potentially alarming discovery at the office and I wanted some opinions. I&#x27;m primarily a SysAdmin but I do have my CCNA so I&#x27;m not entirely useless with networking. Our previous NetAdmin left ~2 years ago and we&#x27;ve (I&#x27;ve) been slowly uncovering everything that&#x27;s been done here as necessary. To say it&#x27;s over-complicated is an understatement (~100 subnets for a company of then 40 people, not including the /30s for OSPF PTP).
 Background: Our ISP provides us a /30 as well as a /27 that we specifically requested. The /30 subnet is terminated (is that the proper term?) on the ISP&#x27;s hardware: they provided us x.x.x.124/30, the gateway is x.x.x.125 on the ISP hardware and our IP is x.x.x.126. The /27 is terminated in our hardware connected to their hardware: with block y.y.y.160/27 our hardware has y.y.y.161 and acts as the gateway. x.x.x.126 and y.y.y.161 are on separate VLANs routable via a VRF.
 The question: is there any benefit to using VRF in this situation? Or is there any benefit to the subnet being terminated by our hardware rather than the ISP&#x27;s hardware?
 Side note/question: These IPs and the VRF are configured on a switch, not a router and/or firewall. I&#x27;ve further discovered that both x.x.x.126 and y.y.y.161 provide console access to the switch PUBLICLY. I&#x27;ve since closed that via access lists, but are there any other security concerns regarding this situation?
 Flaired this as routing but it could qualify as security. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Just a hypothetical - if there wasn&#x27;t anything stopping you and you could build out your dream ISP network servicing business customers, how would you do it? What services would you offer and what kinds of protocols/platforms/tech stack would you use to offer those services?
 (I realize the real world is full of constraints like exiting/legacy deployments, silos within a company slowing progress, cost of upgrading to newer equipment, etc... yet I&#x27;m curious what some people here would imagine as a really nice setup if they weren&#x27;t restricted by anything)

 Routers with ospf exchange LSDB (Link State Database) between each other. Is there any chance to get access to this database ? To see what is inside ? Try to replace it ? I plan to run OSPF on Raspberry, cisco router and Microtic (because this is what I have) generate some traffic and then download LSDB and see what I can do with it hmmm....
 PS: i am not intrested about commend &#x27;show ip ospf db&#x27; more about some .db file hmm...

The only thing I can think of is that it could require increasing of MTU limit on both ends. But is there something more to it that could make it an unpreferable choice? Especially from security perspective.

                              <span>Trying to understand server OS licenses vs CALs.
 The CALs are purchased based on the number of users and devices accessing your servers regardless of having 2 servers of the same OS or older or 2,000 servers, correct?
 Then server OS licenses are based on the number of physical or virtual CPU cores in each server with a minimum of 8 per server? However, if you are running Windows Server Datacenter, you can buy Datacenter server licenses based on the number of physical cores on the host machines and that covers an unlimited number of virtual guest copies of the OS running on the hardware?

                              <span>Hey Folks, 
 So my CEO wants to send emails to our suppliers a few times a year. Mostly stuff like Merry Christmas, etc. 
 We recently had ATT Mark us as spammers because our webapp is sending ~280k emails a month that are mostly just &quot;Hey, Your Order Has Been Shipped&quot; or &quot;You requested to Reset Your PW - Here are instructions&quot; type stuff. Standard eCommerce Webapp emails. 
 My question is this -- would you allow a CEO to send to a standard contact group a few times a year... and then create the contact group and let them go crazy? Are there restrictions you would put on this? Would you insist it go through a marketing email campaign manager due to risk of reputational damage?
 ​
 Thanks!

 I&#x27;m the solo IT guy at my company and while I have a year of experience in this environment, have my A+ and am currently studying for my Network+, and I do the work of network admin, help desk, IT manager etc, I know that I am not nearly experienced enough to know what a healthy IT environment looks like or how to correctly implement it. I inherited this system with no documentation, no backups, all the classics on here.
 I was fortunate to talk to some members of another institution similar to mine just up the road, and they offered for me to visit their site for a bird&#x27;s eye view of how they run things (thank God they took pity on me). I&#x27;m trying to make a list of things to ask and not ask - I don&#x27;t want to burn bridges by being invasive and I don&#x27;t want to walk over and say &#x27;teach me everything&#x27;, but at the same time I want to make sure I can benefit from this experience.
 If you had the chance to tour another IT environment and learn from it, what would you do?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had the good fortune to get interviewed by a few recruiters over the past few months and the ones who didn&#x27;t push me through all said the same thing. I don&#x27;t have experience working on a team this big. Which really sucks and shouldn&#x27;t really be a factor. I have 11 years of IT/sysadmin and web dev experience.
 I&#x27;ve been a jack-of-all-trade type for about 9 years between two companies and my consulting on the side. I also have sales b2b experience for 4 of those years. I know how to pick up systems and processes really quickly and easily. I am currently teaching myself full stack development and cybersecurity concepts (since I want the CISSP by the end of the year). I have always been employed and am a good worker, yet these recruiters treat me like some unemployable person.
 The problem seems to be that I don&#x27;t have a structured IT career progression and a lot of it is self taught. Mostly because I was the guy the incompetent managers hired to fix things. Yet somehow I am not getting this picture across to recruiters or they don&#x27;t believe me when I say I work well with others. I know that there is some disconnect between my experience and what companies are looking for. I do believe it is the fact that I have never been in a company that was larger than 500 people. This seems to have hurt me in my job searches. Even though there was diversity, teamwork, irate end users and all that comes with any IT job.
 Is there any advice out there for a sysadmin who is looking to gain exposure to technologies at a large company? I am not dumb and I can handle sysadmin work, but why do the recruiters not want to hire you if you weren&#x27;t in THAT specific industry? Using THEIR specific tech stack?
 Are they not understanding that the things I&#x27;ve done match their requirements (but on a smaller scale)?

 My work is divesting company A, 300 users. Company B will not be providing SharePoint admin rights to give me the ability to migrate the data with a third-party tool. I need to work on an alternative, either export the users OneDrive data to an external drive or export to Company B Azure blob storage, I&#x27;ve never tried this. I will be happy to hear any ideas.?
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Accounting received a legitimate email from said third-party stating the invoice is due, then a few days go buy and they receive the exact same email again only this time the from email is off 1 letter, for instance instead of accounts.payable@xyzcompanies.com it&#x27;s accounts.payable[@xyzcompanie.com](mailto:walt.disney@xyzcompanie.com). Everything else is identical, even the email signatures. There was also about 10 other emails copied so at first glance it&#x27;s not really noticeable. After reply this was followed up by we changed banks, plz see attached for new banking info and then accounting paid it...
 We use o365, mfa is enabled and we even do semi-annual training with knowbe4 to be aware of this type of stuff. Now IT is being asked to investigate but honestly there&#x27;s not really much we can do from here. The spoofed domain was recently registered and all the mail records are setup correctly so it slipped by all the scanners. Email also had a warning in the body that we add to be cautious as this is coming from outside the company. 
 Now we are wondering how a scammer intercepted the communication and was able to phish it. We&#x27;ve seized everyone&#x27;s laptops that were involved and locked their accounts. So far nothing suspicious, no message rules, no unknown logins, no malware. We are wondering if it&#x27;s on the vendors end but even if it is I don&#x27;t think you can really hold them responsible
 I guess this is just a warning to ensure your user base is well-informed about phishing. If anyone has any tips let me know. They are already trying to reverse the transfer but it&#x27;s been weeks since it went through. They didn&#x27;t even know until the legit vendor followed up a month later and said the balance was still unpaid. 
 Said vendor also isn&#x27;t a small fry and is a multi-billion dollar global company. Crazy someone can register a domain 1 letter off.

 And I kinda agreed

                              <span>Hey all,
 My supervisor is leaving. He was in a managerial role and did all the paperwork and reports and meetings. He covered me when I took trips, and was my backup when I needed to bounce ideas or troubleshooting around.
 I, the net and sys admin, do 95% of all IT related tasks, and we lost our low level techs over a year ago, but we positioned in a manor where I can pretty much run the place alone. It&#x27;s not a lot of work.
 Their isn&#x27;t enough work for two techs of my skill level IMHO, and the management stuff is signaling that the IT reports, etc of the managerial role can be scaled down. 
 So, idk what to recommend to the business, and quite frankly I&#x27;m stressed out. Can I run the place myself? Sure. Do I want to do that and never get a free thought to go on vacations unbothered, etc. No. But there isn&#x27;t enough work for two techs. If I brought someone else on we would be twirling our thumbs and it would turn into a revolving door of techs I&#x27;m sure.
 What do I do here? Is an MSP an option? Do they help with windows servers, help desk, and Linux servers? I have zero experience dealing with them.
 Do I hire abother tech and we just shoot the shit most of the day? I&#x27;m beyond stressed over this, and considered polishing my resume myself but the company really needs me and I really like the people who run it, it would be hard for me to do that to them.

                              <span>I have had port exhaustion issues for many months now and finally drilled the issue down to Easus Partition Master&#x27;s updater service.
 ​
 Process explorer showed dozens of connections to china being made by this service. After removing it, I have fixed my port exhaustion issues.
 ​
 I have used Partition Master for many years now, but somehow the version released in the range of last year caused port exhaustion.

                              <span>Occasionally we have the need to transfer the contents of a user&#x27;s Onedrive to a location on-prem. Reasons vary, so I won&#x27;t go into all that. I&#x27;m wondering what options others have come up with for this? We have been accessing the user&#x27;s files via the admin center and web interface, but it&#x27;s just so clunky to do it this way when they have a large amount of stuff out there. The MS Sync method has given varying levels of success as well.
 I&#x27;ve seen third party tools that offer Onedrive cloud connectors like Filezilla and such, but they only give you access to the Onedrive of the person logging in. I&#x27;ve seen feature requests for these to add the ability to access the Onedrive&#x27;s of others the admin has access to, but it looks like there is a technical issue to doing this?
 Does a good solution exist for admins to get at the contents of User&#x27;s Onedrives without having to mess with the web interface download?

 I work for a smaller organization with one main location and a few remote employees scattered around the United States. We rarely have visitors in our main location, so communication with clients is done completely through email and video conferencing. 
 Most of our consultants and executives are well beyond the age of retirement. The only exception is my boss, who is the CTO. We&#x27;ve had this issue where the CEO struggles to handle Teams, Zoom, or Webex calls. Sometimes he unplugs his headset, or mutes himself and thinks his entire computer is broken. 
 It&#x27;s gotten to the point where I&#x27;m called up to his office every time he has a video call to assist him. Naturally, this is becoming extremely disruptiv…</span>

                              <span>Looking through my email I got a recruiter trying to find a &quot;Service Delivery Engineer&quot;.
 Now what the hell would that be? I don&#x27;t know. According to Google- &quot;The role exists to ensure that the company consistently delivers, and the customer consistently receives, excellent service and support.&quot;
 Sounds a lot like customer service rep to me.
 What is up with this trend of calling every role an engineer??? What&#x27;s next the &quot;Service Delivery Architect&quot;? I get that it&#x27;s supposedly used to distinguish expertise levels, but that can be done without calling everything an engineer (jr/sr, level 1,2,3, etc.). It&#x27;s just dumb IMO. Just used to fluff job titles and give people over-inflated opinions of themselves, and also add to the bullshit and obscurity in the job market.
 Edit: Technically, my job title also has &quot;engineer&quot; in it... but alas, I&#x27;m not really an engineer. Configuring and deploying appliances/platforms isn&#x27;t really engineering I don&#x27;t think. One could make the argument that engineer&#x27;s design and build things as the only requirement to be an engineer, but in that case most people would be a very &quot;high level&quot; abstraction of what an engineer used to be, using pre-made tools, or putting pre-constructed &quot;pieces&quot; together... whereas engineers create those tools, or new things out of the &quot;lowest level&quot; raw material/component... ie, concrete/mortar, pcb/transistor, software via your own packages/vanilla code... ya know

                              <span>Hello Everyone,
 I am currently a Telecommunications technician at a data center and have been working on trying to move my career foreward. I think I am mostly looking for any ideas, tips and tricks, and/or a curriculum on how to best make the move into network engineering or a similar field. I love the trouble shooting part of my job but the long drives to my work place and the physical wear and tear on my body are starting to beat me down. I have an extremely strong knowledge on anything layer 1 and have been working on passing a JNCIA cert. However I feel that may be a waste of time. I am toying with the idea of reaching out to a recruiter and seeing what they could find me and see if any companies are willing to take on someone like me to train up. 
 I was originally a fiber splicer technician working ISP and OSP, until I got my current job. However I feel my current title is very undescriptive of what is expected of me. I work closely with our in house Cloud, Neteng, and syseng teams and have picked up small bits of knowledge along the way. I&#x27;ve attempted to move into the department but management of my department has a hard time working well with others and is seeming to be blocking me. I would love to get work that can be WFH at least part of the time as I now have a one year old and want to be around more than I currently am. ( I work 5 days most of the time, 10 hours with 4-5 hours of travel depending on traffic. ) Any and all advice would be welcome. Thank you all so much. 
 TLDR: Telecommunications technician with layer 1 experience looking to move into the Networking field. Looking for thoughts and opinions on how to make the move.

                              <span>So ystd somehow chrome got deleted from every users computer in our firm, a Windows defender popup came right before saying detected virus on chrome. I am guessing someone messed up and added chrome under defender block list? Or there can be something else behind this shitshow
 Imagine 1500 users emailing and calling for chrome, was a complete shitshow

                              <span>I have been looking at some various vendors that buy IT assets and so far, none of them have mentioned purchasing printers. We just went through a printer refresh (switching from buying printers outright to leasing) so I am stuck with these old printers that preceded me when they decided owning the printers was the play. Does anyone have any experience or ideas about selling some large printers? I am talking Kyocera TASKalfa 6053ci with a finisher level of printer.

                              <span>I manage a grumpy 2012DC (DC1) that intermittently freezes and requires a hard reset to resolve. I&#x27;m in the process of attempting to replace it with a new 2019 server (DC2) following this petri.com guideline for DC migration. I stopped just prior to Step 6 &quot;Demote your old domain controller&quot; because I noticed that the SYSVOL and NETLOGON shared didn&#x27;t exist on DC2.
 On DC2 I can view GP objects when I open Group Policy Management, but when I attempt to edit any of them I receive an error &quot;Failed to open Group Policy Object... The system cannot find the path specified.&quot;
 Running dcdiag tests all return &quot;passed test&quot; EXCEPT SystemLog which returns, &quot;EventID: 0x00000422
 The processing of Group Policy failed. Windows attempted to read the file \\CIL.local\sysvol\CIL.local\Policies\{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}\gpt.ini from a domain controller and was not successful. Group Policy settings may not be applied until this event is resolved.&quot; 
 Can anyone out there provide some guidance on how to troubleshoot this? Much appreciated.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I am a solo sysadmin for roughly 60 users across two sites and I am in the process of migrating all workstations from MacOS to Windows. Due to budget constraints, our migration is slow. We have ~80 workstations and started replacing one every month in July of last year. The reason this is relevant is that we are going to have a mix of MacOS and Windows for a while and processes can&#x27;t just be switched over.
 Here are a few questions that I have and any advice would be greatly appreciated:
  
Because the office is primarily Mac-based, domain administration tools (AD, GPO, etc.) have never really played a major role except for email (on-prem Exchange server). This gives me the perfect opportunity to rework the domain setup to my liking regarding policies and organization. How have you approached this in the past? 
 
Some of our users have only ever worked on a Mac so they would need training right from the basics on working with Windows. How have you handled user training on the new OS? Are there any good user guides out there that cover Windows 11 from the basics and would be easy to navigate for tech-illiterate users? 
 
Due to the sometimes huge process changes, I find that a lot of users will try to tweak the new processes to emulate their MacOS experience, often making their Windows experience a lot more complicated and increasing frustration. How have you helped users adopt new processes and help them see that the new processes, although different, are more efficient and will make it easier for them to do their job?
 
 I know this is a pretty lengthy post, but I really appreciate any responses to my above questions.

 I have 2 long ongoing cases that are not going in the direction i would like them to go so therefore i ask my question here. 
 Summary: 
 We migrated from Exchange 2010 on premise to Exchange Online. The migration itself went fine, we set up a Hybrid and moved everything over gradually.120+ somewhat mailboxes but than the issue; 250+ GB of Public Folders and around 9000 folders at that time. Everything was moved via Powershell scripts, took some good preparation and some figuring out along the way but in the end everything migrated without issues. Read operations of the Public Folders are fine, but write operations to the Public folders are not great.Outlook hangs from time to time and is not useable in the time it is uploading.The time needed to upload…</span>

 I am at my wits end and in hope for your insight.
 I have a WinServer 2019 production server hosting an ERP software. Sometime last week printers stopped working in the software and it appears to be a general printer issue at this server as I cannot manage printers with Windows at all anymore. My biggest issue is, apparantly I am not able to remove/add printers and I cannot find a solution, which has me eyeing registry now for manual removal. sfcscan had no errors, I am not aware of any other repairtools for printerspooler. Driver removal is not possible, as they are being used by the printers. Since I have no experience concerning printers and registry, maybe you can shed some light on that, if it is even possible or know better possibilities beforehan…</span>

                              <span>We have our email locked down pretty aggressively so emails from outside the organization are blocked often enough that we get lots of requests to whitelist them. We have the quarantine notification system on and our users receive a daily email with emails that were blocked. They can request that they be released but this is not enough for some users. Every so often I go in and wipe out the whitelist and wait for users to complain again. Typically, if the request comes from high up, we just do it. For lower level users, I am unsure how to proceed. How do yall handle this?

                              <span>Hello,
 We have 100 servers protected by Sophos Central.
 We need to enable a weekly scheduled scan for each server.
 Each of the 100 servers needs to start it&#x27;s scheduled scan at a different time.
 Is the only way to do this to create 100 separate policies?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi,
 We are testing conditional access MFA using the following policy: 
 Users: Specific group
 Cloud apps or actions: All cloud apps
 Conditions: All trusted locations (Our HQ)
 Grant: Require authentication strength: Custom strength
 Session: Sign-in frequency 30 days
 Session 2: persistent browser session
 The custom authentication strength is almost everything enabled except FIDO2, cert based auth, temp access pass (multi-use) and all of the single factor auth options. 
 This all works quite well for most of our users in the testgroup. However we do notice some bugs or issues.
 1 user needs to re-authenticate OneDrive every day. Sometimes in the middle of the day after a few hours of active use.
 Another user is seeing pop-ups in windows that the account in use has issues/ is broken.
 We also noticed that this user also needed to re-authenticate his workdevice, even though this is an Azure/ Intune joined device. 
 The question:
 Is there something in the authentication strenghts that we need to enable/ adjust?
 Or
 Are there any known issues with the conditional access grant &#x27;require authentication strength&#x27;? 
 Before the switch to &#x27;require authentication strenght&#x27; we used the origional: &#x27;Require multifactor authentication&#x27; for our MFA tests. This worked fine and as excpected.
 ​
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello folks!
 Formerly in our company we had like 10 employees before I got here almost 2 years ago. Now we are 4 employees (including me). 
 The situation at the workplace
 I am focusing on everything IT-related. They have set up a domain network with 4 windows machines and one windows 2012 R2 server. The employees login through the domain meaning its dependent on the server to work. 
 - Every employee has access to the other employees computer (except for mine)
 As some of you know Windows Server 2012 R2 is about to reach its end of life and so does the software we run on it. 
 ​
 Suggestions needed
 Why even bother logging in through a domain at all? Why cant I just setup each computer individually with local accounts? Going with a server is just overkill and its just consuming alot of power (and is also getting very warm in my office). The software that the server is providing with the other users basically just needs a visible-over-network folder. Meaning I can just &quot;share&quot; a folder in the network with a smaller, not so hot running but modern computer running windows 10 and just share the folder with the other windows 10 machines. 
 I think the server solution for us is just too much work and pointless in our current situation. Are there any concerns about turning the logins of my employees into local accounts?
 I didnt know who to turn to and reading this reddit has helped and inspired me alot for my workplace and I really hope it fits with what the community is about

                              <span>Hi! I&#x27;ve been trying for some time to configure Windows 10/11 to work in kiosk mode while also running Docker service and containers in the background. Here are my considerations so far:
  
Containers in Docker Desktop on Windows 10/11 are user-specific, not system-wide.
 How can I run containers that I started on one account while configuring kiosk mode for another account?
 I generate kiosk configurations using Windows Configuration Designer from the Windows ADK package.
 Microsoft&#x27;s documentation in this area is extensive, but it doesn&#x27;t cover running background services or containers.
 Apart from Docker and containers, I want the kiosk to launch Windows Classic Apps by specifying the path to the executable file, which I have already tested.
 I don&#x27;t want the Docker Desktop window to be accessible to the kiosk user.
  
Any additional recommendations or insights would be greatly appreciated!

 We plan to give all users some standard software i.e. teams, office, etc... with only a few of them 5 ish who have software specific to their role. What do you think the best way is to handle this whole process, something I can suggest to my manager and implement between us?

                              <span>Hi, I have a customer that uses windows 11 to access an L2TP vpn. The configuration worked up to about 10 days ago, now it does not work anymore. 
 The vpn is configured as split tunnel, so internet traffic stays out of the vpn.
 He connects to his wifi at home, then to the vpn, and after just a few minutes (or even just one minute) his internet connection dies. It seems to be connected but he cannot do anything on the internet and of course inside the vpn too.
 He connects to his wifi hotspot on his phone, same issue
 He connects to his home router via a network cable, everything is fine.
 So it seems that when he uses wifi and the vpn, his wifi somehow dies, traffic just stops.
 I have tried setting up a win11 PC the same way (he&#x27;s VERY remote, so I&#x27;m not going to his home, I must solve this remotely) and my win11 PC has the same problem. 
 Googling &quot;win 11 wifi l2tp vpn not working&quot; or something similar gives no meaningful results, so I&#x27;m here asking if someone else is experiencing this issue.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been tasked with investigating the options for on-call alerting software for my company.
 We already use incident.io to manage any incidents themselves, and track metrics and trigger alerts with DataDog, both of which are integrated into our Slack workspace to send messages to a custom channel. But neither currently support sending out either SMS or phone call alerts to an on-call engineer (and we can&#x27;t wait to see if they are building it). If everything else was A+ I would accept app/push notifications, but using the mobile phone network is first choice.
 The reason I bring up those existing systems is because a lot of tools out there (PagerDuty, BetterUptime etc) cover a lot of the same bases as well as the on-call alerting, so we&#x27;d be paying a fair chunk of change for features we have no intention of using. I saw a recent blog post about PagerDuty alternatives, but from my reading many of the listed products are covering the incident management portion (like incident.io), but missing the actual alerting via SMS or phone call (out of hours, when we can&#x27;t expect engineers to be paying attention to the work Slack).
 This needs to be a SaaS solution, because we want to be able to alert in the case that our entire platform on which all our own stuff is hosted is having issues. Given that we&#x27;re entirely in AWS currently it also shouldn&#x27;t go down if AWS has issues.
 What products are other people using? Would you particularly recommend or warn against using it, or is it just &#x27;good enough&#x27;? Is there anything out there that really focuses on the callout schedule and actually calling people out, rather than all the rest of the management and tooling around that?

                              <span>I have 5 sites which are completely seperate and each has its own AD Forest not related to the other (i.e SiteA.domain.com). There is no domain trust or site to site vpn setup and they are to be kept seperate. However they all have 365 user accounts under the same 365 tenant using same domain.
 So I am wondering if I can setup AD connect at each site to sync user accounts? Does 365 have a limit on AD Connect or restrictions if they are all the same domain? I can&#x27;t see any posts on my exact scenario as all others have some AD domain trust or under 1 forest.

 I&#x27;m looking for method to wipe SSD and NVMe drives. I was searching quite a long time and found ShredOS which should work with those types of drives. 
 However, when I boot the ShredOS, I cannot see drives there. Only my flash drive which is used for boot. It&#x27;s something with ShredOS or it&#x27;s not supporting SSD, NVMe and M.2? I read few reddit posts and people were saying that it should work.

                              <span>I have an HPE 2040 SAN that I replaced with an HPE 2060 earlier this year, and I was wondering what should I do with it.
 To give more context : I&#x27;m the sole IT in a 100 users company, basically manage everything, but I joined just one year ago and I have no history regarding this, I started as helpdesk and climbed my way so I don&#x27;t exactly know best practices regarding this. 
 My initial idea was to unplug it and store it in a safe place so that I can reuse it if any disaster occurs, but I feel like it&#x27;s a waste of resources. I could for instance make a complete test environment which I currently don&#x27;t have (I only have test machines and systems for very specific things). 
 I may also try to use it as a lab, for instance to test new things (learning a bit more about Proxmox which I think may be enterprise-ready for some time in the future, already use it privately and would like to try on on high-end machines).
 Same thing happened with my previous ESX hosts, I basically unplugged them and stored them even though they are still perfectly functionning. I budgeted their replacement and didn&#x27;t have enough rack space to keep them on, so I stored them safely. 
 Anyone care to give me general advices on what to do with them ?
 Thanks !

                              <span>Hi guys,
 Seeking the hive mind as i&#x27;ve exhausted most other options here.
 A users Excel always hangs for 5 - 10 seconds when closing, the file can be on OneDrive (Local), Network Share or even a blank workbook. It sounds pretty trivial but its actually very frustrating to work with.
 This is a new Windows 11 machine (4 months old), it&#x27;s a pretty well spec&#x27;d workstation for office use.
 - The behaviour is not repeatable when starting excel in Safe Mode. 
 - The behaviour is repeatable with no Add Ins enabled.
 - The behaviour is not repeatable when using another user account on the PC (domain joined). 
 - Office is the latest version.
 - Tried many small online fixes (Disabling hardware acceleration etc etc).
 What else does Safe Mode disable that might be causing Excel to hang like this?
 I&#x27;ve yet to do a fresh install of office as i feel it probably wont make any difference.
 Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.
 Thanks

 I recently made the tough decision to quit my first job as a sysadmin, and I&#x27;m seeking some advice to validate whether it was the right move or not. I apologize in advance for the lengthy post, but I want to provide all the necessary details.
 I started this job about two months ago, excited to kickstart my career as a sysadmin, after 2 years stuck in the helpdesk. However, things haven&#x27;t gone as planned. My primary responsibility was to develop and roll out our CRM system, which initially seemed like a fantastic opportunity for me to learn and grow. Unfortunately, the project got stuck due to platform issues, and no one seemed proactive in resolving them or assigning me other meaningful tasks.
 A few weeks ago, I approached my manager to express my concerns about th…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 Over the weekend I pushed out a group policy to define the &quot;Log on as a service&quot; permission to some service accounts. This cleared out the settings on an application server that had this value defined manually by gpedit.msc
 I was under the assumption that my policy would have added my accounts in addition to any preexisting ones but I was obviously wrong.
 My issue is, I have other domains to roll this setting out to with applications I&#x27;m not fully aware of.
 Is there a way for me to query servers in my domains to find any servers that have this setting defined manually in gpedit as rsop.msc doesnt show the manually defined ones.

                              <span>I recently set up a new file server, removed the partition that contained all the shares from the old one and added it to new FS. I removed the old FS from our and removed the deactivated computer object. Then I changed the IP.and the host name of the new one to the same as the old and everything seemed fine.
 Now exactly 30 days after changing the host name the trust relationship between the AD and the new FS failed. I logged in as a local admin and reset the computer password using PS and everything worked again.
 How do you guys do it? How long do you wait to change host names after a migration? Did you experience something like that and will.it happen again after the next 30 days? Should I remove the machine from the AD completely and rejoin it anew if it happens again?

                              <span>Hi all,
 At the moment I have about 500 laptops that are fully Azure AD joined and managed from Intune. In two months 500 new laptops will be ordered that I would like to use as a hybrid. So then they are Hybrid Azure AD joined with MDM Microsoft Configuration Manager/Intune.
 The new laptops come with Windows 11 Pro pre-installed.
 Normally I install all new equipment via Microsoft Configuration Manager which includes an local AD join step. The machine then enters Azure via Azure Active Directory sync. The machine then enters Intune via Cloud attach in Microsoft Configuration Manager.
 What is your method of getting machines with a pre-installed (Pro or higher) OS hybrid?

                              <span>Our organization is currently exploring the implementation of Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) to improve remote access for our employees. However, we have a mixed setup, with some resources hosted in the cloud (such as O365 and various Web SaaS apps) and others hosted on-premises.
 To provide some context, we currently utilize Azure AD with Business Premium License P2 for our authentication and access management. We have also adopted a Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policy, allowing employees to use their personal devices to access organizational resources.
 However, due to compliance requirements, employees are only allowed to access O365 applications if their device is registered with Intune and Conditional Access policies are applied.
 How can SASE help address our specific needs and challenges in this mixed setup? We are aware that SASE combines network and security capabilities into a unified cloud-based solution, but we are uncertain about its applicability to our situation.

 Now we are going to buy new storage SAN (alletra) 
 Is it possible to use both our old hp servers for the same storage, but then only the computing power (ram /cpu), or is it only possible to use 1? We can run with only 1 but 2 would be better. 
 (main reason is load balancing. can i like setup 30 vm&#x27;s and set that the first 15 use the cpu of hyper visor 1 and the second one the other 15?

 20 y/o IT admin here. I fucked up bad today, just to give some context my company is acquiring another business and will be managing them. Technically the ownership is not until a few days. Currently there is the existing ISP modem the business uses and then there was one installed recently that is ours. There is an edge router thats also existing and we just went ahead and shipped off a meraki MX95 that we will be using with our ISP. 
 A ticket was assigned over to me to work with a third-party technician to install the MX95 and get WAN connectivity up and running (VLANs and DHCP IP scopes were pre-configured) The ticket was made by our PM and was relatively vague. 
 It was titled router deployment and the notes just i…</span>

                              <span>We’re considering getting a second drop from our colocation provider for full redundancy. We currently have a couple pfSense boxes in HA alongside a couple customer firewalls so we do have an L2 switch sitting between our drop and all firewalls.
 What’s the best route to go with if we go with a redundant drop? 2 separate L2 switches? 2 stacked switches with STP? Connect each pfSense box to each drop then passthrough whichever public ips to the customer firewalls? Something else I’m missing?
 I don’t always reply to every comment so thanks in advance!

 ​
 NaaS sounds like a threat career, but I&#x27;m wondering how others feel.
 Does anyone with first hand experience either at the consumer of NaaS or the vendor mind sharing? 
 Is there still a role for a network engineer at a company that consumes NaaS? And if so, what does that look like?

                              <span>Hello,
 Does anyone know if ethernet-to-fiber converters can be used with plain old telephone service? Obviously, there are physical differences between RJ-11 and RJ-45.
 I purchased Primeda-tronic 2 Ports RJ11 Telephone and 10/100Mbps Ethernet Over Fiber Converters that worked for a few months, but I believe one of the converters has given up the ghost.
 Any information or recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

I was told I should look into using a DAC instead of an SFP to RJ45 transceiver. So far I am unable to find a DAC that works for HP, and that works for SFP 1G, everything seems be for SFP+ 10G which i&#x27;m reading is not compatible. Does anyone have any recommendations?

                              <span>I was curious if anyone knows the answer to this question. When connected to a Loadmaster and looking at the statistics, I am trying to understand what the Total Conns means. Is that just a connection for an individual service, port, user connection, etc? It is a total connection over 24 hours? The ask is because I do not know why some of my numbers are so high, when the system is a test system and not heavily utilized by more than a few people, however the total connections is over 2000.
 Seems Kemp questions are pretty vague here in this sub, but I am hoping for the best. If I should post this in another sub I can do so. Thank you in advance for any help.

                              <span>Hello Big Reddit Brain. I’m studying for CCNP and working through HSRP. Pretty easy to understand, but I’m stuck on one concept and the class materials are not explaining. So, the Physical Active Router handles ALL of the traffic, including ARP requests, which are first sent to whatever router the host is connected to. What if a host is physically connected (through the topology that might include some switches) to the router acting as Standby? The book/class doesn’t mention it, but is there a requirement that there be redundant L2 paths for hosts so they can potentially reach ALL routers participating in HSRP?

                              <span>Had an incident where a weird dormant Cisco device bug affecting a few versions reared it&#x27;s ugly head after we made a change which caused at least 1 production device to begin repeatedly reloading.
 I kind of want to take on a side project to leverage some Cisco API to identify potential bugs related to upcoming changes across a large array of platforms and IOS/NX/XR versions. So I guess this post is for one of two things.... has anyone done anything similar to deal with one-off bugs that would be hard to identify in a lab environment before changes, and 2.... is there a solid Cisco API that I could parse against a keyword or software function (eg: BGP, SNMP, etc) and a list of device types/versions to try and proactively identify these types of issues? I&#x27;ll be using Python, but language/nuances don&#x27;t matter too much as I know not everyone here is super familiar with code.... more looking for if anyone knows manual methods or data sources/api&#x27;s they&#x27;ve leveraged in the past that I can put code to in order to make a web front end that does these checks for us prior to changes.
 Thanks for any info!

 Hello there! As mentioned in the title, we require a program with the same functionality as TCP Test Tool by SimpleCom Tools. 
 So far, I have been unable to find another program, and the one by SimpleCom needs .NET Framework 3.5, and installing/enabling it is not an option. 
 Does anybody know of a similar program or if there is a newer version of it? (The one I found was v.3.0).
 Thanks in advance for any help you can provide!

                              <span>My apologies in advance if this is the wrong area for this kind of problem or if it&#x27;s too simple.
 I&#x27;m an old dinosaur who used to set up office VPNs about 15 or 20 years ago. These were simple VPNs which allowed remote users to access their documents at their office.
 The method back then was to set up a vpn connector on the laptop, point it to the public IP, and set up forwarding for a couple of ports in the router. Then IIRC I&#x27;d set up permissions in their account on the server.
 I&#x27;ve been called upon to set up a VPN for someone, and it looks like things have changed remarkably. Whn I search in order to bone up, most returns are for commercial VPN companies who are focused on providing anonymity on the web.
 Has my method of creating simple VPNs become completely outdated? I assume that security issues and methods are very different nowadays.
 Are there any good resources out there to re-learn basic VPN principles and best practices? Perhaps as I&#x27;ve gotten older my search capabilities have dwindled, or else I&#x27;m so hopelessly out of the loop that I don&#x27;t even know what to search for within the context of small office VPNs. If anyone can steer this old coot in the right direction I&#x27;d greatly appreciate it. Again, I apologize of this question is not appropriate for this group.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m trying to apply Voice, Video, and some critical data QoS to out network. I&#x27;ve done the research on how to create a class-map, policy-map, and how to apply the policy-map to the interface. However, when I try to apply the policy-map, it is getting rejected with error message:
 &quot;Invalid queuing class-map!!! Queuing actions supported only with dscp/cos/qos-group/precedence/exp based classification!!!&quot;
 I&#x27;ve tried using both dscp and cos just as the message is saying, but the policy-map won&#x27;t get applied to the interface.
 class-map match-any VIDEO
 match protocol rtp video
 match cos 5
 class-map match-any VOICE
 match protocol rtp audio
 match ip dscp default
 policy-map QOS-POLICY
 class VOICE
 priority level 1 percent 25
 class VIDEO
 priority level 2 percent 25
 This is the class-map and policy map that is currently configured. Our switch is Cisco Catalyst 9500-40x. Is there switches that can&#x27;t accept certain QoS configurations? I&#x27;ve read that the interface supports certain QoS traffic and this is the result of the interface i&#x27;m trying too apply this to:
 TenGigabitEthernet1/0/38
 Model: C9500-40X
 Type: SFP-10GBase-LR
 Speed: 10000
 Duplex: full
 Trunk encap. type: 802.1Q
 Trunk mode: on,off,desirable,nonegotiate
 Channel: yes
 Broadcast suppression: percentage(0-100)
 Unicast suppression: percentage(0-100)
 Multicast suppression: percentage(0-100)
 Flowcontrol: rx-(off,on,desired),tx-(none)
 Fast Start: yes
 QoS scheduling: rx-(not configurable on per port basis),
 tx-(2p6q3t)
 CoS rewrite: yes
 ToS rewrite: yes
 UDLD: yes
 Inline power: no
 SPAN: source/destination
 PortSecure: yes
 Dot1x: yes
 Breakout Support: not applicable
 Is the interface compatible for the QoS?

                              <span>We have 5 switches in production. 2 at HQ, 2 at PDC. 1 at DR. The 5 are eBGP peered and we have a VXLAN overlay between sites. Think multi pod but more than one DC. Anyways, I want to add a second switch at the DR site. I’ve never stood up a VPC after the bgp peering. My questions: 1. What is least intrusive process to add the second switch? 2. What do I need to plan for in terms of downtime? 3. What will happen to the routing when the VPC initially comes up?

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m trying to find a configuration which will allow me to use IPv6 prefixes from multiple ISPs. I&#x27;ve tried configuring multiple prefix delegations on the gateway router, and the end-devices receive IPv6 addresses from both ISPs, but the traffic ends up being black-holed (I&#x27;d love to know why, if anyone can tell me).
 My current gateway is an Edgerouter 12, but hardware isn&#x27;t a blocker if I need something more advanced. I have familiarity with PFSense, Cisco and a bit with some other vendors.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Going through our switches that were recently configured and I am coming across some some inconsistancies with the vty lines. Some are like this....
 line vty 0 2, line vty 3 4, line vty 5 31 
 Then others will be 
 line vty 0 4, line vty 5 98 
 And some other ones too with random numbers.
 Is there an easy way to reconfigure these so that every switch is the same? I know the commands to do so, but Will I lose ssh connection and have an unreachable switch if I delete all the vty lines and then configure new ones?
 I need to change the session timeouts on all the switches and its tough to push a config change out when all the vty lines are different.

                              <span>Hi, has anyone had any experience with getting DHCP snooping working on Dell OS10?
 I have a pair of S5232F-ON running OS10 10.5.5.3 configured as a VLT pair.
 The manual is pretty vague on DHCP snooping - it says all you have to do is configure &quot;ip dhcp snooping trust&quot; on the uplink that faces the DHCP server, and then enable &quot;ip dhcp snooping&quot; globally. I&#x27;ve tried this, and as soon as I turn on DHCP snooping globally, attached systems can&#x27;t get DHCP any more. As soon as I turn off snooping, DHCP works again.
 Support say that as no bugs have been reported with DHCP snooping, it must be that I&#x27;ve misconfigured the switch. This is entirely possible but not very helpful!
 If anyone knows how to make it work for sure, I&#x27;d be very interested.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Background: I&#x27;m running Proxmox with one physical interface, eno1, and two virtual interfaces, vmbr0 and vmbr1. vmbr0 is bridged to eno1 for a few VMs/containers to sit directly on my LAN. vmbr1 is a private Proxmox LAN and is NAT&#x27;d through vmbr0 to access the internet. I have a web server on 10.1.0.5:443 and have a DNAT rule in iptables to achieve port forwarding:
 iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i vmbr0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 443 -j DNAT --to-destination 10.1.0.5:443 
 The problem is that when traffic comes in from the bridged devices, this rule ends up applying since it&#x27;s coming in on vmbr0 and then getting forwarded out. How I can make this rule apply only to packets that originally come from eno1 or distinguish it in some other way? I&#x27;d prefer not to just put exceptions for each individual bridged IP. I&#x27;m still pretty new to iptables so any help or clarification for any misunderstandings I may be having is very appreciated.

                              <span>I have pretty stringent SLAs with my customer so I am looking at getting extra Internet insurance. 
 I have two DIA circuits to two diverse providers, diverse entry points into the building and diverse paths all the way to the providers POPs. I am doing BGP to each and advertising out a /24 so I feel pretty confident in the resiliency of this design but I am really adverse to taking a SLA hit. 
 I am curious if I was to add two cradle points and BGP peer with the cell providers and advertise out the /24 as a third and fourth backup option is even possible and if anyone has done this.

 I am working on this old network infrastucture and I am trying to replace some 3Com 4500 with Ruckus ICX 7150-48P. While doing some tests I found out that if I connect this two models of switches together with a patch cord everything works fine, but if I try to use a fiber link, the status led one the port lights up only on one switch, the 3Com.
 I have tried every possible combination of SFP module, tried to configure the ports in many ways but nothing seems to work.
 I wanna ask if in your opinin it is possible that these switches are just not compatible because I have tried replacing both switches, one at the time, with various ones and always worked except in this one condidion.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I am currently examining the DDI market and would like to know about the existing standards and trends. Specifically, I am interested in cloud-based solutions or cloud-managed options available.Currently, our organization lacks an IPAM system, and DHCP and DNS functions are handled by the AD DCs. In addition to Infoblox, BlueCat, and EfficientIP, I am curious to know about other notable players in the market. (I would like to avoid Infoblox due to its high cost.)
 I am not looking for an overlay solution to manage DNS and DHCP on the AD DCs. Rather, I am interested in a separate solution that can remove the DNS and DHCP roles from the AD DCs entirely.
 Objective is to streamline infrastructure by separating the DHCP and DNS responsibilities from the AD DCs and consolidating them within a comprehensive DDI solution. Solution will be internal only, no public facing DNS, split-horizon, etc..
 EDIT: Looking for enterprise solution with vendor support, no DIY with Netbox and BIND/KEA

I currently have a Google domain and use Wix for the website, I emailed them to see if they could help this is what they said 
 &quot;I have noticed that not only SPF and DKIM, but DMARC record has been added to your domain&#x27;s settings as well. Kindly note that Wix does not support DMARC records. There is a lot of overlap in the function of DMARC &amp; DKIM, and the use of DKIM+SPF is more effective. Thus, kindly remove the DMARC record from the TXT section&quot; so I&#x27;ve removed the DMARC record right now. Can anyone help me make sense of this? What exactly does this mean and how will this affect my business domain email deliverability?

                              <span>I find myself obsessively on tech sites all day when I&#x27;m not actually working so that I always stay up to date, keep my skills sharp, and all that. 
 It&#x27;s starting to take its&#x27; toll and I&#x27;m becoming a very doom-scrolly about it all because I&#x27;m quickly discovering there&#x27;s more information out there (most of it painted in a negative light) than any human being could ever process to keep their sanity. 
 So how do you guys find that balance between work/education for retaining your work and living off-line? 
 The internet seems more like a prison every day.

                              <span>Are any of you seeing stupidly large increases in spam/phishing in your email security services over the last few weeks of May? I&#x27;m talking 2,500% more (yep, roughly 26x higher)!
 It&#x27;s all being rejected by Mimecast ESG for reasons like &quot;IP found in RBL&quot; - which is great. But... why us, why now, and are other org&#x27;s seeing the same?
 Mimecast Support are not telling me if other client tenancies are seeing the same increase.
 Here&#x27;s some stats:
  
17/04/23 Mimecast Account Assessment for the week report shows 18,984 total rejections with 11,963 as IP in RBL for the week. I&#x27;m adding this in here because this is an average week, and has been for over 18-months.
 14/05/23 Mimecast Account Assessment for the week report shows 39,026 total rejections with 33,817 as IP in RBL for the week. This is…</span>

                              <span>I need some advice....
 I have 2TB of data on a windows server ec2 instance, just over half a million files and folders (not evenly distributed) some are gzipped, some are plain text, video etc. All of it is really important and I need to move it as fast as possible to a host outside of amazon. 
 Can someone recommend some software to do this? I&#x27;ve been trying to backup to s3 using some backup software but the transfer speeds tank after the first 200GB or so has been transferred. Goes from 1gbps down to 50mbps....
 I&#x27;m not hitting bandwidth limits or anything. Its something between that software and s3. The instance and bucket are in the same region. I also tried using network drives from the destination host but something is off with the transfer to the host from aws, getting 2mbps max (using robocopy)
 Need help :(

 Calling CS is entirely useless, as usual… and I’ve looked everywhere on the internet, couldn’t find anything useful. Sent emails to abuse@comcast.com and the others, tried VinylDNS with no luck as well :/

                              <span>Our company is in the process of rolling out MS Teams to the organization. The direction is currently to deploy a MS Team to each department and then use the underlying Sharepoint site that is created automatically for that Team and customize it as their department Sharepoint site. So the department would be able to use the MS Team for Teams functions and open/link to the Sharepoint side underneath for all their departments Sharepoint needs. The Sharepoint would have permissions customized for different libraries and would also have things like Meta tags customized, etc. 
 Here is the kicker. Every event, training and MS rep I have ever spoken with has said the cardinal rule of Teams is you do not make customizations to the Sharepoint underlying a MS Team It is more of the engine underneath and you use Teams to drive the car; however, a new vendor we deal with contradicted that and said it is fine and using the underlying Sharepoint is the way to go. So I am doing somewhat of a sanity check. 
 So I am trying to crowdsource some real world examples of if/when this will cause issues. My opinion is we should be spinning up a separate Sharepoint site for each department but if I am wrong I would like to know know as well so I can grow. 
 I did some searching but couldn&#x27;t find many concrete ways that utilizing and customizing the underlying Sharepoint site for a MS Team would cause issues/break things but I wanted to do my due diligence before we set out down this path if it is the wrong path.
 So I thought I would reach out to the community and see what everyone thought.

                              <span>I was working in a small company, being the sole IT guy doing everything from setting up firewalls and servers, to troubleshooting printers. 2 months ago I had a pretty big fuck up, and last week I was told they finally found my replacement.
 As much as this sucks, the place was pretty toxic and once I find a new job I&#x27;m sure I&#x27;ll be much happier. My question is, how do I handle the question of why I&#x27;m looking for employment? I feel like telling a prospective employer that the job had a very negative impact on my mental health to the point that I started to make mistakes is probably not the best move.
 I&#x27;ve never been in a situation like this, so I would love to hear any advice. I actually have a phone interview later this week, but still shell shocked over the whole situation, and I&#x27;m not sure how to even talk about my current employment status.

                              <span>Hello all,
 I am working on AD/Group Policy cleanup and organization and I&#x27;ve come across a few GPOs that are extended to our child domains.
 This is a bit new to me since the last two environments I worked out of did not follow this practice and would re-create the same GPO for each child domain.
 IE, If the parent root domain has a GPO for specific server configurations, that same GPO is re-created in each domain within the forest. A fairly manual task but leads to the creation of the GPO settings locally on the DC of that child domain.
 Now, I&#x27;m working with multiple GPOs that are extended, which is nice but I&#x27;m not entirely sure if it&#x27;s ideal. I can&#x27;t recall where I have read that this is bad practice and I can&#x27;t narrow down why but I came across this Microsoft AD Design Considerations and Best Practices article that indicates it&#x27;s a normal thing to do.
 AD: Design Considerations and Best Practices
 Based on the Microsoft article and it being semi-recently updated, I&#x27;m assuming that extending GPOs across domains is a normal practice?
 I&#x27;m more curious about the performance impact.
 On one of my child domains, I search my sysvol\child.domain\policies folder for a UniqueID of a GPO that is extended and I do not find it. This means that the computers need to reach out to the parent root domain for that policy, correct?
 While when I search for a locally created GPO UniqueID within the child.domain\policies folder, I find it obviously. 
 ​
 Any ideas or thoughts on this approach in managing GPOs on multiple domains within the same forest?
 Thanks

 I&#x27;m just wondering how you all do it out there.
 On the one hand the company data is secured by wiping it but on the other hand you just gave the thief a usable laptop.
 I guess its not that hard to swap a harddrive, so we wipe them.

                              <span>In our environment we have an application which runs via SSH. The windows clients received via Intune Putty and a shortcut pointing to Putty containing the IP address for the connection. Now we might have to update the IP address in that shortcut, so the plan would be to deploy a superseding app (the shortcut is deployed via script as a win32 app), but this of course will take some time, and I was thinking if there&#x27;s a way to improve this kind of update. This time we can&#x27;t just move the old server ip address to the new one as it will be still needed on the old one. What would be a good solution to connect all the clients to the new server without intervening on the clients?

                              <span>I have been given a computer with Windows 10 Pro that seems to have a deceptively simple problem. The search bar next to the start button on the task bar cannot be used. Even when I click the Windows Key and S nothing seems to happen. I have tried the following procedures;
 I tried everything in this link, https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/shell-experience/fix-problems-in-windows-search#solution-3-restart-windows-search It didn&#x27;t work.
 I tried following this video, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;i-QzUVwZ3Bg&amp;pp&#x3D;ygUhd2luZG93cyAxMCBzZWFyY2ggYmFyIG5vdCB3b3JraW5n It didn&#x27;t work.
 What else may be the problem?

                              <span>Hello,
 I installed Alma Linux on VPS, then I update it, then I installed CyberPanel with OpenLiteSpeed and now I’ve created a fresh site in public_html I only have the basic index.html file.
 When I write the server’s IP in the browser, I get the 404 error from OpenLiteSpeed. I even tried to open it as a IP/index.html but still I got the 404 error.
 I checked the permisions for both the public html (drwxr-x—) and index.html (-rw-rw-r–) and they are just like in the shared hosting with cPanel that I want migrate to the VPS.
 As I said, this is a fresh install and didn’t change anything and simply I don’t understand why I can’t access the index.html file.
 Please help me!

 I&#x27;m currently delivering free training on the full CompTIA A+ course. The course consists of 20 modules and I will creating a dedicated video for each module. Some of these videos might be a bit long since each video covers a whole module after all.
 I add time stamps in each video for you convenience if your only looking for something specific in a module or only want to refresh on a certain topic so please feel free to make use of them.
 There will be 22 videos for this course, the first is just the 6 min intro explaining the course, the last will be a dedicated exam tips video and then obviously the 18 videos in between will be your modules with the actual course.
 The training should be enough to pass both the international exams for A+ and the other courses I deliver sho…</span>

                              <span>So I make mid 150k with bonus incl. zero college. No certs. Im recently got promoted as an IT Dir and I feel I am overpaid. I’ve worked my ass off and I was content making 100k usd. I am the sys admin for literally all systems and I have one tech that helps me but I do all the heavy lifting. I’m on call 24/7 but I’ve managed to keep the system stable to the point I barely feel I’m on call. My boss is amazing. Understands very well the time/life balance thing. I’m also afraid that the new 150k is the old 100kusd given inflation. Can’t help but think I am still being overpaid. It scares me because I know finding another job at the same pay rate will be difficult. I’ve done my best to keep my life style comfortable making less money and putting away. I suffer from ADHD and anxiety. And it’s driving me crazy. I’m a making too too much of it? )no pun intended)

                              <span>We need to do reset this pc on about 1000 machines, we worked out a way to trigger it via SCCM on demand so users can do it when is suitable for them. Part way through deployment we discovered a number of machines have a faulty/missing winre.wim and would just reboot strait into the troubleshoot menu. After replacing the .wim file we get part way through the reset process but it then fails, there&#x27;s a number of config errors in the $sysreset logs that I&#x27;m trying to identify the core issue from
 The strange part is when we copy the Hardrive and boot it up in a VM in hyper-v it says fixing C for a bit (3 stages) and then when doing the reset it works strait away. 
 Any idea what the fix hyper-v would be doing on first attaching a disk to a VM?

                              <span>Hey,
 I have multiple client users who have developed problems with network drives (DFS shares). The only thing that changed on their system was a forced W11 update (not my decision). Whenever a user opens a folder on the shared drive, it&#x27;s extremely slow and crashes Explorer.exe after that, or it hangs in the &quot;Not Responding&quot; state. This behavior is present while in the office or with a VPN from their home network. This issue is not present for everyone, only for a handful of users.
 What I&#x27;ve checked and done:
  
Checked that network speeds are fine -&gt; Everyone is getting 100+ Mbps up and down.
 
Checked that system uptime is not crazy high.
 
SFC and DISM returned no issues.
 
Cleared Explorer cache
 
Made explorer run each window as a separate process.
 
All Windows updates are installed.
 
All &quot;Lenovo System Updates&quot; are installed.
 
Unmapped all drives and remapped them again.
 
Made sure that Defender are not scanning the network drives.
 
 The only thing that I&#x27;ve found out so far is that unmapping the drives fixes Explorer&#x27;s slow speeds and crashes. These users rely heavily on these drives for their everyday work (Sharepoint migration is in the works but isn&#x27;t going to be done soon).
 At this point I&#x27;m kinda out of ideas, can&#x27;t even find anything to try. Does anyone know any fixes for this?

 Thank you guys :):):)

 ---------------------
 Hello guys, i have an msi package and i need to install it on specific group of computers, so, i created a security group called computersGroup1 and added the computers i need to apply gpo on, and followed the below article here
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/190901/apply-gpo-only-to-one-computer
 but when trying gpoupdate /force it says completed succsefully but no software is installed, and using gpresult /r doesn&#x27;t show my gpo.
 the msi package is located in user configuration so it can be installed at startup

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve recently landed my first sysadmin job and while I&#x27;m super excited about this opportunity, I must admit that I&#x27;m still very green when it comes to sysadmin skills.
 Since I have a considerable commute to work, I thought it would be the perfect time to dive into some books or handbooks to download on my ebook that could help me level up my knowledge in this field.
 Whether it&#x27;s a comprehensive guide to Window/Linux administration, network management, or security best practices, I&#x27;m open to any suggestions that can help me become a more competent sysadmin.
 I&#x27;m looking for resources that are beginner-friendly, providing clear explanations, practical examples, and hands-on exercises. It would be great if the books cater to both Windows and Linux environments since I&#x27;ll end up working with both at some stage of my career.
 Additionally, I&#x27;m interested in hearing about any online resources, blogs, or podcasts that have been helpful to you in your sysadmin journey. Any supplemental learning materials that can be consumed during my commute would be fantastic!
 TIA

                              <span>Hi,
 I am looking for a tool to keep an inventory of computers complete with their components and ideally also with the software installed on them. Preferably a cloud solution to keep everything online.
 At this moment I found 2 good options but maybe you have something else to recommend.
 1 Option is Snipe IT (https://snipeitapp.com/)
 But that&#x27;s only for inventory. I have to add computer specs manually.
 2 Option is PC Doctor Toolbox Remote (https://www.pc-doctor.com/solutions/toolbox)
 There I can add computers to an account and have everything I need at once but not as a list. I am not sure about this solution, won&#x27;t it consume too much computer resources when transferring everything live?
 Thanks for your answers

 Server error: &#x27;451 Requested action aborted: local error in processing&#x27;
 they are claiming there IT have said we have blacklisted them, which we haven&#x27;t.
 ​
 I have only ever come across this once before but it was when dealing with someone hosted by IONOS. We use 365, and the client say they do as well. 
 Anyone any experience with his issue?

                              <span>My apologies if this is not the right sub to post in but... I scored an interview for a L1 Helpdesk role after months of trying to get my foot through the IT door. This will be a group interview, which is not something I was expecting at all. Is this common for helpdesk positions?
 Feeling super nervous, so I&#x27;d appreciate any tips/ advice :&#x27;)
 Edit to add extra info: The interview will be held online, and the invitation mentioned &quot; splitting you into groups&quot; which makes me think that it might be a group interview where multiple candidates will be present.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m having an issue with a Windows Server 2019 VM.
 The environment:
  
Single Host VMware ESXi 6.7.0 build17499825
 4 VM Windows Server 2019
  
Only one of the four VMs started to crash, no changes were made to the VM.
 This VM has some administrative software that is used by end users.
 What is happening:
  
VM works, I can connect through RDP
 Rdp connection closes unexpectedly
 From VMware console, I can see the VM is still on but in the Sign-in screen the network icon has a big red X on it.
 When I try to enter credentials, it just keeps loading forever
 When I reboot the VM, it loads until I see the Windows logo and then it restarts automatically
 After three times it goes in recovery mode
 Tried all usual stuff from a mounted Windows Server ISO (chkdsk, sfc scannow, dism, rebuild bcd... nothing works)
 I restored the VM from backups and then I took a snapshot from VMware
 The issue is that I can&#x27;t check Windows logs to find out what happens during the crash as the VM becomes unresponsive. I can only revert to the snapshot.
 When I revert to the snapshot I can work inside the VM until the crash happens again.
 It seems that before the crash there are no error logs in the Event Viewer.
 I think it could be the software installed inside this VM that triggers the crash but I cannot get proof.
  
EDIT
  
I created a local user joined to local admin group
 I was able to log in after the network crash
 I can see that under Control Panel there are no network cards, it does not matter how many network cards I add from VMware ESXi
 It seems like a driver issue, in Device Management I see a lot of unknown devices with warnings 
  
Any ideas?
 Thank you

 I have added the address to the anti-spam inbound policy that we have but we keep getting the same emails from the same address.
 Are there any other steps that can be taken in situations like this?

                              <span>Hello,
 ​
 We have a labcomputer that just died so i want to open it upp to check what the issue can be. 
 ​
 This computer is OLD and i have never seen one that has no screws and no buttons to open the chassi before. I have tried with just force to open it by dragging the side panels but they do not budge at all. Any ideas? 
 ​
 Here is a picture on the chassi
 Near the blue markings ive made there is just a hole, its not a button to press.

                              <span>Is it a good thing to allow windows users the ability to reset their own domain passwords without asking sysadmins to do it?
 Now i dont know if this is a possible thing im still new to Windows Server, but assuming it is
 We get lots of password reset requests from our users and i&#x27;ve seen that senior system admins have said this is not a priority it can be attended to in 4 hours they are not in a hurry
 but to me it&#x27;s just a few clicks and the user is back on their workstation in no time it doesn&#x27;t take time
 So i&#x27;ve been thinking why not give users the ability to reset their own domain passwords just like google, facebook etc allows us? it should spare us time to work on other things and gets the user back to production in little time

                              <span>So I have been on the hunt for a new job and one of the places I check regularly is my countries Job Bank. 
 I see a lot of &quot;seemingly&quot; good positions with decent wages.
 But recently a ton of them have for applications to send it to a email....nearly all of which have a generic domain, be it Outlook, Gmail, even a few old Hotmails in there.
 ​
 The consensus I get from others in the field is that if a company is too cheap to have its own domain, then there IT budget is likely a mess.
 But I am curious how cheap they are .
 Tried googling domain costs and I get different answers, some saying .net domains are like $3-5 Canadian to buy, others say .com are $15-20 Canadian to buy with another 20 or annually.
 Others say its $500 dollars.
 I get estimates all over the map, just curious what is a standard domain name initial buy and the annual fees and see how cheap a lot of these companies recruiting are.

                              <span>Good evening r/networking,
 We are looking at the possibility of jumping from one WLAN MSP who has been with us for a very long time to another, newer one. The older one has provided a decent quality of service but has been very expensive with respect to WLAN/LAN costs for clients in the building. The building I work at is a very large campus (over 700k sqr ft), and I am not in a position of leadership, but I&#x27;m being dragged along for observational purposes, opinions, etc. My supervisor is a finance person, and I am the only in-house IT Manager/Network Engineer person on site for these systems. I would love to bring it in-house and build out a department, as I feel it is silly to jump from one MSP, gut out all that past experience and knowledge of the building/know-how on dealing with clients, and going to a new one. I&#x27;ve been reading non-stop about design and management, but I was wondering if people had any advice on how to approach this, resources I should read up on, questions I should ask, etc. I won&#x27;t lie, I&#x27;m nervous about this whole ordeal. Thank you.

 I&#x27;ve never done this, and my first configuration is to switch a WatchGuard to a Fortinet and the configuration files for both are...in wildly different formats.
 For future use, what&#x27;s the best way to configure them? What info should I be forthcoming wtih in terms of using? Capturing rules/tunnels first? Blocking ports?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I’m pursuing a networking career and currently working as a field support technician (my job mostly involves tackling escalations, configuring/installing network devices and occasional server hardware installation or troubleshooting).
 I acquired my CCNA last year and I learned heaps from this certification.
 I really enjoy networking and would like to work toward getting the CCNP in the future. I understand there is a core exam (ENCOR) which needs to be passed before undertaking a concentration exam. I have very basic scripting knowledge but like idea of network automation and hoping to spark serious interest to this area.
 I may not know enough to properly make a decision on which specialty field to take for the concentration exam, but hypothetically speaking, if I were to choose the DevNet Professional for the concentration exam, would it make more sense for me to take the DEVASC exam rather than ENCOR?
 I would likely enjoy studying for the ENCOR exam since the topics appear very important to know and interesting but because I want to strengthen network programming, the DEVASC exam look nice as well.
 Btw I’m not in a rush to get CCNP certified, it’s something I would like to study slowly in addition to working full-time.
 Open to everyone’s opinion and advice!

                              <span>Quick background, prior military. Worked on a Enterprise network for close to 6 years and I realized I love everything network related and Linux. I was fairly confident in my skills, being a mix of a sys admin/network admin. 
 I understood what I was reading, how to implement changes, why are some areas are wrong, and so forth. I felt I was mid to senior level based on situations I resolved and people around me congratulating me.
 Then I start doing interviews and I couldn&#x27;t really answer most if not all network questions. It was a eye opener and I believe it was because everything I learned was self taught, (googling, help command, reading past sailors notes, and good old trial and error). 
 My current gig title is a system/Network admin where I do software installs for ships and make sure no problems arise during the process. Not a lot of network problems pop up. I want to be a cloud network engineer in the next 5 years, so what is the best way to validate/better my skills as a network engineer in you guy&#x27;s opinions?

 I have no formal certs in Networking, but my eventual goal is to set up a business but I’m not very familiar with that and what kind of services a networking business could provide, does anyone here have any good advice on what things I could offer/provide and some advice on a pathway to get there? 
 Thank you for all your time!

 I&#x27;m looking for something that is easy to use, free, and reliable. Additionally, it would be great if it supports UEFI.

                              <span>Hello All,
 This might not be a good fit for this subreddit, but I&#x27;m curious whether any of you have heard of a Microsoft&#x27;s recent offerings to protect the data stored within SQL Server databases, &#x27;Transparent data encryption&#x27; (TDE) and &#x27;Dynamic data masking&#x27; (DDM).
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption?view&#x3D;sql-server-ver16
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/dynamic-data-masking?view&#x3D;sql-server-ver16
 My place of employment is investigating whether one of these methods might be useful to protect the data within some of our systems. 
 I&#x27;m not a DBA, I&#x27;m in an app support space, but I&#x27;m about to seek our vendor responses to either of these methods. As far as I can tell, with either method of encryption, the app is none the wiser, it&#x27;s completely ignorant of the protection of the data in the same way that Windows apps are completely ignorant of the presence of BitLocker encrypting a HDD.
 As I say, this might not be applicable to this subreddit, but I&#x27;d love to know of anyone familiar with these technologies and if so, any gotchyas or caveats or horror stories.
 Cheers!

 For everything network related I usually go for nmap, but I don&#x27;t know where to look when it comes to Windows, I often end up looking at procmon but I look for something more polished that isn&#x27;t as overhelming
 Thanks in advance and have a good day!

                              <span>Strange situation, though maybe not all that uncommon. I inherited an environment where previous admin had configured an Enterprise CA. We are in the process of removing all the servers from one of our locations and this CA is there. In the past, it seems this were used by local web apps for our organization. However, we have moved towards using another CA in another AD forest for our web apps as we are obligated to use the new CA in another forest. The only certificates that are currently active, non expired, and issued are our domain controllers. 
 Can i go through the decommissioning and not transferring certificates to other AD Forest CA without disruption (i have no access to other CA)? Will this adversely affect our domain controllers? It seems like the domain controller certificates are elements to a Windows environment implementation and would not impact Windows Domain services, etc if I decomissioned properly.

I wanted to step up the ladder since there was a single sysadmin (owner) for everything. So I started getting server/VPS upgrade requests from clients. However, I literally had a breakdown by the second or third occasion. I was just stalling the task for over a MONTH, literally dreading the task for 24/7. I literally came out of that experience completely broken.
 At this moment, after such a long time, I realised that it was the fucking &quot;trying to hammer at a pillar while standing on it&quot; nature that flipped me the fuck up. Of course I was out of my mind having to do some shit I dont understand and being an idiot for not having a proper backup. Naturally, I did not even ask a fucki…</span>

                              <span>Can anyone recommend decent public colleges that have good MSIT programs?? My tuition will be 100% covered by GIBill if I go to public colleges, and don’t want to let it go to waste. Additionally, I am in my late 20’s, single and have no significant debt so I want to pursue it before I raise a family. Any recommendations will be appreciated. Thanks!

                              <span>I guess I just can&#x27;t figure this working thing out. In my mind I eventually land at nimble, medium-sized company free of red tape full of mentors and powerful, popular products with happy customers!
 In real life I&#x27;ve jumped jobs 3 times in 16 months trying to find a company worth being at.
 Legend has it (before my time), most of the old knowledge walked out the door and the owners brought in a bunch of new people. But it&#x27;s the blind leading the blind. Like they are 100 tickets behind in support cases, customers are yelling at the support e-mail boxes every day, features are delayed, and nobody can barely train me to help at all on our software (Service desk is below my role but I&#x27;d do it just because they need it) because hardly anyone knows what&#x27;s going on.
 I am grateful for the job but there&#x27;s also something to be said for being proud of your workplace and, that I am not. Low-key can&#x27;t see how they possibly are surviving much longer.

Ideally they would completely reset on boot, so all user files, etc, would be deleted and some specified software would be &quot;installed&quot;. Is it possible to do this without booting from the network or booting from a restore point every time? If the restore point is the solution, how can I make sure all of the systems load from that on boot every time?

                              <span>Sorry if wrong sub please direct me to the right sub for this question then
 So basically I&#x27;ve been thinking about this and still don&#x27;t quite get it. Take a standard Windows 10 Pro OS for example. If the BIOS isn&#x27;t locked by a password, you just enter it and boot into a USB drive containing a Windows Password Recovery software and bam, you got access to the admin account since now you got the password to it. If the BIOS IS locked with a password, then you take out the CMOS for a minute, put it back in, now the BIOS has been reset and you can enter it again without any password, and now rinse and repeat what I&#x27;ve said earlier. If Bitlocker Pre-boot PIN is enabled, then you can just crack Bitlocker with a software like John The Ripper (but that&#x27;s way more complicated than just using the software itself, there&#x27;s many extra steps to it and it can take hours even, but I&#x27;m not going into that coz that&#x27;d take too much time and space). So Bitlocker doesn&#x27;t protect someone from knowledgeable people like IT forensics (working for the police), a BIOS password also doesn&#x27;t. Windows also includes a lot of telemetry by Microsoft by default, so if you&#x27;re super paranoid, then again it&#x27;s not a good OS.
 I could go on and on about the many different exploits of the Windows OS. Why do companies still use Windows Enterprise as the OS on their workstations (unless we&#x27;re talking servers but here I&#x27;m not; I&#x27;m talking about the workstations employees use, on their company laptops etc)

                              <span>We are a Windows shop with about 4000 endpoints using SCCM. I needed to push out a .exe we received from a vendor (which puts files in the user’s AppData folder) to clients with a silent switch. I created a PS script to copy the .exe to the machine, run install and put a validation file on the C:/folder so SCCM can figure out if it has run or not. If I manually ‘Run Script’ for that machine it will work fine. I created a package to be able to create a schedule/required install and it always prompts for elevation when the endpoint tries to run the script. If I take that same script and copy it to the endpoint and try run it, it won’t run because the script is not remote signed. I am unable to set the execution to unsigned or bypass because we have the GPO set to only allow local scripts and remote signed. I’ve tried this as a domain admin and get the same result. We also have used the PSAppDeploy scripts before with no issue and those have stopped working too. I’m quite certain that the -bypass in the script is not working now either when it tries to run. We have been running this same setup for years and have not had this issue before. There is one code sign cert on the endpoints from ‘Microsoft’ that did expire a couple weeks ago but I don’t know where that came from or how to renew it. All the certs on the SCCM server are valid (but none of them are a code sign cert). We do have a CA and I’ve tried to create a code sign cert to push but I haven’t gotten that working yet. Any ideas as to why this would all of a sudden be an issue or how I can get this working?

                              <span>I have recently got an L2 job in a company where I have to perform operations on app servers i.e. fetching logs generated by app. (App is monolith and backend is developed in java and being served at tomcat). There are several other tasks performed by L3 regarding preparing environment e.g. installing mysql, pacemaker, web servers e.g. nginx, apache, tomcat, reverse proxies, load balancing, deploying SSL certificates and most important troubleshooting. I want to learn all these tasks and have been studying RHCSA course. At this point I am pretty familier with linux with a plus point of bash scripting. I want to learn all these tasks mentioned above so I could master in monolith deployment and could later proceed towards microservices architecture and Kubernetes. Rhcsa course doesn&#x27;t include most of the thing mentioned above. Please recommend me any good source where to master all these tasks from. Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;&#x27;ve recently accepted a position as senior system engineer for a big company. 
 I&#x27;ve been in the role for 10y+, multiple small, medium and big firms, but what&#x27;ve found here is singular (for me).
 In every company i worked for, we used to have some kind of sandbox envoironmanet, some old vmware vsphere or cluster or cloud of some kind available for the only purpose of checking new technology, thinkering around, stay on the edge somehow. Here there&#x27;s nothing like that: all the envs must always stay in a &quot;working&quot; condition, and every new implementation must be approved, analized, and green lighted ON EVERY ENVIRONMENT.
 I talked to the management about that and they agreed it could be important to have a destructable and rebuiltable envs for study purposes, something agile, but also it&#x27;s not prioritized: it&#x27;s literally the last entry on the to-do list.
 Here it comes my question: there&#x27;s some kind of literature about the importance of having this kind of things? Something that would help my needs climbing the to-do list. 
 ​
 TLDR: My bosses are totaly ok with me standing idle if there&#x27;s nothing &quot;broken to fix&quot;, I&#x27;d love to them to provide us a R&amp;D env for playing. Looking for some literature to back my request

 Our MSP set up an autopilot policy for us, it’s been working fine but doesn’t remember the last user signed in. Users therefore have to enter their username every time they want to unlock their machine. 
 For the life of me I can’t find where this setting is inside the settings picker. I can find “Interactive Logon Do Not Display Last Signed In” but this is not enabled. 
 I’m hoping to avoid having to rebuild the entire thing just to sort this out, so hopefully somebody has an answer!
 Enjoy the long weekend :)

 in these days I&#x27;m trying to implement different data loss prevention policies. However, I can&#x27;t implement the policy that allows me to block the sending of files containing sensitive information in the chat... has anyone already implemented a similar policy? Or can you help me implement them?

The domain verification passed when I uploaded a html verification file to where my website is hosted. I have added 3 CNAME (dkim) records and 1 text file record to cloudflare dns register for my domain. However my email dns record check keep failing. I raised a support ticket, however to no avail yet. My domain is from godaddy and I have pointed my ns records to cloudflare. On cloudflare for the 3 CNAME records I have tried changing from proxy to dns only and it still fails. Any advice on this will be great.

 We currently use ManageEngine Log360 which has AD Audit Plus, LogAnlayzer and Office 365 Manger
 Just currently looking around if anything better is around
 We are currently rolling out FortiGate&#x27;s and will be using FAZ for that aspect.
 ​
 We need to at the very least
 - AD Logging - Who logs in etc, Wrong Password Etc
 - File Server Logging - Who did what to what file and when and who accessed files
 ​
 We also want
 - SharePoint and Teams Logging - Who accessed a file in a SharePoint site - We currently have no way to tell this easily
 - Computer Logging - What time was computer logged in and by who - We are currently moving to Azure AD and loose this when we disjoin the computers from Active Directory and move to Azure AD only

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m trying to achieve a situation where I can generate a persistent ssh host key every boot. My (custom) initramfs is build into the kernel which is signed and securely booted with my own PK in TPM.
 In the initramfs I have build tpm2-tools, dropbear and cryptsetup alike for decryption of the main rootFS, based on TPM2 PCRs/LUKS.
 Now in case any of the PCRs change the rootfs will not mount and I will be in a situation where I&#x27;ll have to ssh in and decide if I want to accept any changes in the PCR registers and add a new unseal policy to allow luks decryption which more or less works fine.
 The challenge comes that I do not store dropbear ssh host keys in the initramfs, figuring they would be readable from the signed efi kernel by taking out the bootdisk and thus would allow mitm/decryption of my ssh session while manually logging in to fix the pcr/luks decription.
 This makes it so that I get the obvious warning that the host key changed everytime I ssh into initramfs.
 My thinking is there should be a way to get, or more likely generate, a fixed host key from TPM/PCR to feed to dropbear that would not live on the boot disk.
 Anyone have any suggestions how to do this? All TPM/ssh examples I find are for the easy solution to store client keys, not the host key...

                              <span>Hey guys, 
 I’ve recently been tasked with improving the file storage at work and I am not sure where to start. We are a small manufacturing company that deals primarily with cad files, pdfs, and spreadsheets. We don’t require collaboration on files, just a central storage solution with allowable permissions. We deal with sensitive information and are looking to become Itar compliant in the future, so it must be quite secure. Currently we just store information on hard drives, but we’d like a cloud solution to access anywhere. Anyone have any recommendations or sources?

                              <span>Have a few weeks of international travel coming up soon, and trying to see if there is a good way for me to just bring one laptop but isolate the company stuff and my personal stuff via dual boot.
 We have a company issued Lenovo laptop, fully managed by Microsoft Intune. I also have a personal Dell laptop, I can add that to my authorized device and access company resources.
 Brought two laptops last time I traveled and it was a PITA, hence wanting to bring only 1 laptop this time around, but want to make sure I isolate the company stuff and personal stuff completely.
 Thinking about the following options:
 1. Bring company Lenovo, install a copy of Windows into a portable SSD, and boot from the portable SSD when I need to use it for personal. 
 Pro is I can disconnect the SSD physically when I don&#x27;t need my personal stuff to isolate it. 
 Concern is if the company will be able to scan my personal data without me booting into the company copy of Windows(such as BIOS backdoor), and if it allow me to boot from portable SSD (this one I can test out).
 2. Bring my Dell laptop, install a copy of Windows into portable SSD and add it to authorized device to access company resources.
 Pro is I think the company control for personal device is less than corporate issued device, or at least they claim it to be.
 Concern is my personal data will be in the internal SSD and they may scan it if I boot from portable SSD and not remove the internal SSD.
 3. Bring my Dell laptop, install the company managed OS into internal drive, and install my personal OS into portable SSD.
 Probably the safer way, but more work and more PITA.
 ​
 Wonder what you think would be the best option in terms of data isolation from company IT admin perspective, appreciate any input you may have

                              <span>I work for a MSP and I&#x27;m taking over our workstation deployment department and have some plans to revamp our current solution to be more unified and streamlined. I was curious what other people are using. 
 We&#x27;re currently using two different methods for different solutions. A &quot;golden image&quot;+MDT for most people using on-prem or a USB &quot;golden image&quot; for Azure/Intune. 
 ​
 Things I&#x27;m looking to improve immediately:
 Update Caching (squid)
 Application installation automation (entertaining ideas, most likely going with a chocolatey/PS solution I&#x27;d write myself)

                              <span>This is probably my biggest issue for 3rd party tech support. When your ISP has a device that has either packet loss or high latency issues.
 Currently our ISP&#x27;s device has higher than normal latency. It&#x27;s a solid 70ms. I have tested pings from a few remote work buildings, my house and other tech houses. They are all the same. Every hop up to that point is low. Averaging below 20ms. But this last hop is always 70ms. It&#x27;s the ISP&#x27;s device in our building that connects to our firewall/router.
 Every trouble ticket we create with them goes nowhere. They say it&#x27;s fine. It&#x27;s fine for web traffic and stuff. But for VPN&#x27;s that users run windows file copies over it sucks! Due to the Windows SMB protocol acting like trash the higher the latency goes.
 Wish I knew a way to get it through to ISP&#x27;s for these kind of issues.

                              <span>I know this is an &#x27;older&#x27; switch to put it lightly, but we are running into some issues with some of our networks losing connectivity randomly. We have a palo alto router and the switch is acting as a l2 switch for several ESXi hosts, passing all traffic to the PA. Earlier we had some problems with certain networks in esxi not being able to reach the gateway and rebooting the switch resolved the issue, leading me to think it was an issue with an incomplete arp table. 
 The issues from earlier have now reoccurred with networks that were not experiencing the problems earlier. Has anyone seen this before in this or other l2 switches?

                              <span>Hi, I was going through a few guides to configure FFrouting on linux, and I see that for most things one would need to manually enter the vtysh shell and input commands there. I would like to make a script for this, but how do I get my script to either enter the vtysh mode and then input commands/run commands in privileged mode without accessing the vtysh like a normal user? I haven&#x27;t been able to find any method to do either from a shell script, I tried looking at how people would do it on Cisco hardware and see EEM scripts mentioned, but I don&#x27;t know how to adapt them to my situation.
 I am very new to configuring routing protocols on linux and writing scripts for such purposes, sorry if this sounds like a stupid question. Thanks a bunch!
  
Edit: Found the solution! I&#x27;m really stupid for not noticing this earlier, but you can use vtysh -c and chain commands, just like you would use sh -c to chain and send commands to the POSIX shell from a different shell. Same concept, explained in the mention of its options on vtysh.
 Thanks everyone, I&#x27;ll keep ansible in mind for next time!

 The network is open, and when connected issues DNS servers quad 8 and quad 9. macOS opens the Captive Network Assistant window, and I can see the window trying captive.apple.com and then the captive portal domain which opens.
 But dig doesn&#x27;t work against the issued DNS servers, the router, or the DHCP server, +tcp or UDP. How is this possible?
 The DHCP server also did not give me Captive-Portal options (114, 103, 37).

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;ve a been a network engineer for over 10 years and a I&#x27;ve always had to use Windows for my work. Most of the time I&#x27;ve used SecureCRT and I&#x27;ve recently discovered Tabby (cool software, btw).
 I found out last week that my employer allows us to use our own devices for work and so I&#x27;m thinking I&#x27;ll start using my Linux desktop.
 I&#x27;ve been wondering what terminal app those of you that drive Linux for daily work use, meaning how you organize your device connection profiles, ssh credentials, etc. Do you simply create command aliases for devices? Or do you have let&#x27;s say folders for locations, that hold one file per device in that location? Do you use build-in password managers?
 I&#x27;ll use Tabby as an example. It has built-in password vault, connection profiles can be organized into folders and it also has a quick-command dialog (ctrl-shift-p), just like vs-code does that quickly allows you to browse through the saved connections or (for example) save output to file, etc.
 Is there a network admin-friendly terminal in Linux or do you guys just use the standard terminal app?
 Thanks for any suggestions!

                              <span>In a Cisco DNA system where the network is a mix of normal enterprise and different OT networks. What will the best practice be for segmentation of the different OT networks? VN all the way? Or is SGT good enough?
 The OT networks use several different OT protocols, but a lot of them is &quot;pure&quot; L2 unicast and broadcast traffic (Profinet RT looking at you). I do not want to have interference between the OT networks.
 My gut feeling is telling me VN is the way to go, but since there is a limit in the amount of VN&#x27;s, I do wonder if there are some other solution?

                              <span>I have a Speedport Entry 2i router from Telekom. Yesterday there was a storm in my area but I disconnected the router out of electricity before the storm started. However, after the storm, my router started behaving weird. After that, only the lights of Power and WLAN were turned on. However, if I turn on my pc, and this router is connected through an ethernet with it, and I navigate to 192.168.1.1 -&gt; status -&gt; Refresh, the ADLS, Online and Telephone lights start turning on one by one and my Wifi works perfectly again. I tried physically restarting the router but no luck. Basically, WiFi works only when I have my pc, connected through an ethernet with my router, turned on and have the router refreshed software-wise from 192.168.1.1. Before calling the custom support, does anyone stumbled upon an issue like this and do you know what could be the cause? Could it be that my router is broken or some signaling/networking issue is present?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been looking for a job since September. Junior sysadmin and other IT jobs have been scarce, especially lately. Competition is insane right now as well. 
 Previously I&#x27;ve made multiple interviews and even reached round 3 at some but still haven&#x27;t landed anything. This was with small and medium size companies and even had 2 rounds with a FAANG. I&#x27;m getting very frustrated and disheartened and try to remind myself there&#x27;s other people feeling like I do. I&#x27;m not used to being without a job, since being laid off lately. 
 I&#x27;ve been studying for a cert hoping it&#x27;s going to help me in the long run, but the exam was hard as hell for me.
 Sorry, I just needed to vent somewhere and to someone.

 Curious what you think. I want to specialize on cloud moving forward as tech is moving that way.

                              <span>Got 4x pm9a3 U.2 Drives setup in a raid 0 as a a scratch drive.
 I will run an FIO speed test and normally the first time after building the raid/booting it will get the speeds it should around 25gb/s and maintain it as long as I let the test run.
 If I stop the test and restart the exact same command it will only get speeds of 11gb/s most of the time, although sometimes I can restart the test once or twice before it will drop.
 Write speeds are always fine at around 15gb/s even when the reads are stuck at 11gb/s
 I have tested the drives individually and they seem to remain stable at around 6.5gb/s, using the same commands, regardless of how many times I start the test.
 To make things even stranger, if I only create a raid of 3 devices I get the ~18gb/s it should but then the speed will drop to 11gb/s with this as well!
 Example of raid command I am using:
 mdadm --create --verbose /dev/md/nvme --name&#x3D;nvme --level&#x3D;0 --raid-devices&#x3D;4 /dev/nvme[1-4]n1
 Using the FIO commands from here, although I have tried tweaking them but doesn&#x27;t seem to help.https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/benchmarking-pd-performance
 It has to be formatted as xfs.
 It is a dual socket 64core epyc milan system, all drives are connected to the same CPU.
 I am at a loss, any ideas?
 EDIT: Was messing with it and decided to try removing the sudo from the command, and suddenly it went to full speed again, then when I tried to run the command again, back to half speed.
 Seems anytime I change the user running the command it will work the first time, this is WAY over my head!

                              <span>I recently posted my issue about a SQL server logs rapidly growing with no Google-able fix found. A fix was found, and it turned out that a replication to a data warehouse server was broken, and the data failures were logged and never released. We killed the replication properly and the log reduction was instant.
 The only change I made was migrating the data warehouse server to our new vmware environment (new hosts, data stores, vswitches, everything) from the prior vmware environment shared by my SQL server. 
 Would this have been my issue? That the migration broke some non TCP-IP connection? Or was this coincidental?

                              <span>Hey everyone, I hoping you all can tell me if it&#x27;s worth fighting everyone all the time.
 Background: I&#x27;m (28) very young for my team(infrastructure management and architecture) being that that my closest coworker in age is about 15 years older then myself and young for the department as a whole where most people around my age seem to be on the help desk or a jr application admin. So I do tend to deal with imposter syndrome but I think I deal with it well as I&#x27;m definitely qualified for the work. 
 I&#x27;m the administer of our on prem virtual environment but have input on our service model and offering because I will have to maintain it. Right now everything is great there is consistent work that I have time to do and really learn from / about. I will be taking on additional responsibilities …</span>

                              <span>Hi All,
 Do you guys know about any software or tools that I can use to roll out apps, require updates, deploy network profiles, and see battery health and disk space available?
 The summer camp I work for recently acquired a fleet of laptops for some classes and activities. I told them that it would be a good idea for us to be able to manage the laptops from a central location to be able to keep an eye on all of them and keep them ready for classes.
 I have been looking at open RMM and MDM solutions and have tested MeshCentral and Fleet but I am wondering if I am looking for the wrong products.
 Ideally I am looking for a solution that we can host on-premises without requiring a subscription or license, or a service we can rent that would cost less than a few hundred dollars a year for about 100-200 devices.
 Thanks and sorry in advanced if this is the wrong forum or the post is not formatted correctly.

But we are facing challenges with mobile platforms because outlook for android and IOS do not support S/MIME (wtf?)... So, what mobile clients would you recommend? or is that even a thing? Management required support for mobile platforms, but IMO because we are govermental agency having highly-confidential info in email is a bad idea, these should not be available on unmanaged/personal devices.
 Apreciate you sharing your experiences and recommendations.
 Thanks :)

                              <span>Our campus is a bit of a mix and match and we have some printers dedicated to departments which rarely use them and could easily use the printer of a nearby department just a few feet away. We are yet to step up our game on department mapping based on location in our AD structure and some departments are split with team members in two different building/office locations. What is the easiest way to tackle having one common printer per floor and building and making sure Bob in building A part of team B is not sending a print job of 1000 copies to Building D a few kilometers away. 
 We are thinking of implementing pin based printing to prevent these spam prints as a precaution, let me know what practices you guys have used before to tackle this type of scenario effectively.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a system as a support engineer that has a policy that enforces TLS on the outbound. I&#x27;m just trying to check something is working and need to spin up a machine for this. I was thinking an ec2 running iredmail and reducing the tls to 0. This might take a bit of time to configure. Does anyone know of any much faster services I could use to send an email to a server that has no TLS configured on it?

 I noticed that some Event ID numbers change over time, like Microsoft changes them with Windows updates for some reason?. 
 For example, 4624 LogonType 7 was used 1 year ago or so, now it is not used. So I now use 4738 to check if a user signed in entering the pw.
 I&#x27;d appreciate any insights.

                              <span>Hello!
 I&#x27;m currently running a more or less consumer computer at home with Hyper-V Server 2019, with two Windows VM&#x27;s (one is a Domain Controller) and five Linux VM&#x27;s. 
 Now.. afaik Hyper V Server is discontinued, so there will be no 2022 version. Support for it though will continue until 2019, so this should be the issue. My question tho is:
 What should be better?
  
Hyper-V Server 2019 with two Windows VM&#x27;s and five Linux VM&#x27;s
 Windows Server Core with Hyper-V role and two Windows VM&#x27;s and five Linux VM&#x27;s
 Windows Server Core with Hyper-V &amp; Domain Controller roles, one Windows VM and five Linux VM&#x27;s.
  
Any ideas?
 About the third option: I rarely encounter an issue where my Domain Controller VM isn&#x27;t reachable or up, which could result in auth issues with my Hyper-V server, which is part of the domain, so both bundled together would more or less elminate the issue.
 I know there&#x27;s already this thread, but this is now 3 years older and is about Windows Server with Desktop, so a lil&#x27; bit different.

 what are the differences between Privileged Identity Management and Entitlement management in Azure AD? They seem to basically offer the same features? Are there any recommendations when to use what? Should one be preferred in general? 
 Thanks :)

                              <span>What I want. 
  
buy a license, activate the windows in a VM in hyperv. Can run the machine for years or destroy it next month, create a new VM, fresh install, activate. As long as you are not attempting to run two VMs with same license you are good.
  
What I suspect
  
Once that VM is activated you better not &quot;lose&quot; that VM. The license is tight to some HW ID of that one VM, reinstalls can be done on that one machine.
  
What I fear
  
Oh you cant even use the typical win pro license in hyperv. you have to buy windows server 2016, 2019, 2022,.. special license with whatever cal sublinceses for machines/users that would connect to that machine

                              <span>Knew it was coming, but was initializing a couple new Win11 Pro PC&#x27;s today, and for the first time finally encountered a mandatory MS account build of [pro] windows. Even &quot;work or school&quot; made me start with a ms account login.
 Build 22621
 Anybody have any workarounds? I know I read fairly recently this was coming, but was surprised how angry I actually was when I encountered it -- the fact it was after hours on a holiday weekend Friday didn&#x27;t help I guess. I needed another hoop to jump through like I need Suzie in accounting to click another blatantly fake 365 phishing link 🤦‍♂️

                              <span>On my JG962A, after unplugging the unit because the power cable was blocking a new Synology Cable Arm, upon restoring power I&#x27;ve recently started receiving this PoE Alarm message:
 Trap 
: PSE 4, IfIndex 5, Detection Status 1 (or Status 3)
 This happens on every port that is capable of using PoE. I&#x27;ve tried a firmware update, factory reset, and then leaving the system unplugged for over 5 minutes.
 Is there anything else I can do to resolve the issue?
 (Edit: Clarify the two different Status # &amp; PoE works when testing with Fluke)

We need to be able to control who logs on (aka, who contributes to the monthly bill) and have monthly data caps. There would be 10-20 users. From what I&#x27;ve researches we need a router or switch with a built in radius server, or need to make a stand alone radius server.... while I could cobble something together, It would be nice to have a commercial off the shelf system, that a non tech savvy melinial could manage.... anyone have any suggestions?

 I’ve been tasked with looking at ONIE switching for our 2 rack colo deployment. 
 The reason for ONIE is a management push but I am hesitant and pushing back. 
 While I can see the benefit for larger networks, I don’t know that there will be enough resources to manage it at the current moment or if it makes sense. (If it is easier than I think it to be please share your experiences) Also licensing costs. 
 This would be a 1G Fiber uplink for the first year then it would bump up to 10G on year two. 
 Ideally it would be great to future proof it to an extent. (SFP28 of SFP+ as an example.)
 EdgeCore and Dell ON series are switches that have come up frequently during my research but have not had direct experience with them in the past.

I would like to control it manually by sending movement data from a microcontroller(ESP32). Kessler crane has documentation regarding their kOS network protocol to communicate with their motion control products. But I do not get, what is the format(Data-type) in which we are supposed to send the data? Should we send in the exact byte order(Big endian) that has been mentioned? Is there an easier way to do this?

 I noticed that most people here use either cisco or juniper. And my question might sounds dumb or very basic. But i still want to learn lol.

I would allow them to assign trunks shut down trunks etc. 
 CLI with priv levels wouldn&#x27;t be a solution. I need something more user friendly and easy to read. I tried playing with https GUI but i can&#x27;t seem to make priv levels to work. I managed either readonly or full access. I tried to define a priv level 5 that would allow some commands, in CLI works but in GUI it doesn&#x27;t.

                              <span>So, people in our Azure AD Tenant have been creating groups with very strange names, examples being:
 ​
 CompanyName_FC-QA_AccountMgr-Clinician
 I don&#x27;t see the point of making a group with underscores and dashes mixed, then some other groups and literally just dashes, and then the rest of it just spaces..
 ​
 Is it my OCD, or would this drive you insane? Especially the underscores.

                              <span>As the subject says, is it me or am I that crazy. I took over a decent sized network and my predisisor installed the os on a secondary vd on an md1400. Now the vm&#x27;s are failing. Along with the disks. One at a time. The installed ssd of untouched. Mind you, he put the os on a 12tb drive. Everything is slow even moreso the vm&#x27;s. How the hell do I fix this.
 Love or community.

                              <span>I’m searching for a new job in the Chicago area after being a “Tech Director” for a small school district. I don’t know what the proper title would be outside of education. I’m not a director as it would commonly be defined. I manage all technology in the district — planning, budgeting, implementation, maintenance, and decommissioning. Network, servers, security, etc, etc. I have a part time technician that I manage. 
 I know a little about everything but I don’t know if I know enough about any particular sets of skills. I’m also scared I have learned bad habits from being solo for so long. Everything I’m looking at job-wise either seems too advanced or too entry-level. 
 Just wondering if anyone else has been in a similar spot and what the outcome was.

                              <span>Our company is seriously considering Netsuite. What are the pitfalls of using this software. We have sapbuinessone and our accounting dept gave up using it and we just use a warehouse and manufacturing third party module. We have a developer that would do the same in netsuite. We are considering it but thinking to push implementation to 1st quarter next year as it looks like it’s going to run up against our busy manufacturing season. Netsuite is on the hard sell to sign the paper before the end of may as it’s “the best prices you will get all year”. Is that true? Are end of year may prices better than what we will get in February I feel we are dealing with used car salespeople. I mean I get a call from a rookie Dell salesman and I swear every month is their end of quarter.

                              <span>For about the past month we&#x27;ve been chasing our tails on a pretty awful performance impacting issue with Checkpoint Harmony on our endpoints. Checkpoint says no one else is having this level of problems. Id like to hear from others using Harmony one way or the other.
 Symptoms include 
  
abysmally slow file copies between two Windows explorer windows, even on the same SSD drive
 Outright abends of programs
 Huge laggy performance issues in M365 apps
 Unbelievably slow saves when using mainstream apps like Autodesk Inventor

                              <span>I know TLS 1.2 comes default with server 2022, but does it show up in the registry as being enabled? We were having have sql 2019 CU19 issues and it was complaining of TLS 1.2x upon searching the registry we didn’t see the standard TLS protocol keys.
 We added them with IISCrypto but the issue continues. We run a query in sql and after a few minutes we get disconnected from the server and when trying to reconnect we get the Internal error has occurred. A reboot fixes this.
 Once we log back in we see a lot of dcom errors and various services shutting down ( this is before we reboot) we occasionally see pagefault errors in the sql logs as well. 
 This is a VMware server. 64gb ram with 8cores.

                              <span>I was excited to have been a part of giving Phishing training for our employees along with the phishing button add-on for their outlook emails. All was well for a few months, then I started to notice a huge uptick in phishing alerts being sent my way. 
 At first co-workers were doing very well in identifying the phishing tests and seemed to like the phishing alert buttons convenience. But I think the button has now become TOO convenient. 
 Most of the phish alerts I get are not phishing emails, some are emails that we are sending for employees to do cyber security training OR they are emails from things they have subscribed to, so now the button is being used like its a filter for emails they just don&#x27;t want to read. 
 Should I just send out a mass email explaining the importance of using the phishing alert button correctly? Re-do training? or just be happy they are using it at all? 
 I mean, it doesn&#x27;t take that much time for me to see that most of the alerts aren&#x27;t important, but it does take a bit of time to go through them all to find the actual phishing attempts. 
 ​
 TLDR: Employees are spamming phishing alert button for emails they don&#x27;t like, should I re-do training, send email, or care at all?

                              <span>Hi All, We are a UK SME who has recently been subject to a phishing campaign where the attacker has cloned our website on similar domains and sent our mailshot to attract victims. UK authorities are simply not interested at this juncture as we can not prove any financial loss, but he got pretty close recently. I keep issuing takedown request on these domains which has been relatively prompt, but the lack of interest from Instagram and UK mobile providers has been disappointing to say the least. I get the impression this will go on ad-infimum until we are significantly more proactive in our defence.
 Obviously, this is not the forum for legal advice, but from a technological perspective has anyone experience of or alternatives to Domains tools Iris Detect to monitor for lookalike domains please? Indeed any other UK specific advice would be very welcome.
 Many thanks

I&#x27;ve been through the CSP slides, we want to stay with the EA. I&#x27;m starting my prep for our EA renewal and would love a Microsoft partner that will still work with us on the renewal. Anyone have a MS partner that would recommend for EA renewals?

                              <span>Hi,
 We market a software solution that runs in the cloud or on our infrastructure for most of our customers. One of our customers (very large for our situation) insists that if we want to continue the collaboration we need to migrate the service to their servers (excuses about standards and regulations, middle management and users want to expand, IT is blocking us, senior management is labile). The problem is that we are afraid for our intellectual property, because their IT department (4x bigger than our whole company) is doing similar things to what we offer to the market. 
 So I wonder, is it possible to encrypt a virtual server running on someone else&#x27;s physical server in such a way that the owner of the physical server cannot bypass the protection?
 They run VMWare EXSi, we run HyperV, and my knowledge of VMware is quite limited, so a detailed explanation would be appreciated.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m not a sys admin myself, but In my line of work I have acquired a lot of decommissioned hardware. Mostly routers, switches, and APs.
 Most have been removed from the original company portal when it was given to me, but occasionally they forget and it&#x27;s pain in the ass. In other situations, the original company no longer even exists and all the equipment leftover from a take-over is stuck in limbo.
 Are there brands that are particularly troublesome and not as safe or easy to wipe for resell?
 To name a few I have:
  
Aruba - I&#x27;m told that transferring the license from locked aruba equipment can be particularly difficult even when 
 Cisco
 Meraki - Someone mentioned the are essentially bricks?
 Ubiquiti - I&#x27;m told as long as these are fully reset it should wipe their portal information out
 Juniper
 Peplink
 Netgear
 Fortinet
 Tp-Link
  
I might be missing some others.

 Even with the headers there isn&#x27;t always a single easy to spot way to see what triggered it.

 Never say never - especially to the management!
 So in Q1 this stupid OKR was set to &quot;reduce running costs by 10% by the end of the year&quot; by a management who doesn’t have any idea how things work in IT. They complain that we have too many subscriptions, claiming that surely there are a few that aren&#x27;t essential, without even knowing which tool does what. At the end of the day, it&#x27;s more about workplace politics than facing the reality so we had to keep that OKR and &quot;see what we can do.&quot; (rolling_eyes)

                              <span>Howdy all! Part of our business process includes receiving images from out in the wild for damage claims. Recently, Apple and Samsung have started using HEIC as a default format, and it&#x27;s driving our claims folks nuts since there&#x27;s no easy way to open them without the 99 cent converter (which, since it&#x27;s needed to be purchased from the windows store per user account, has been a fairly unattractive option). 
 The only work around we&#x27;ve found so far is providing the few folks who handle the incoming images with a copy of GIMP, but it&#x27;s far from an elegant solution when there&#x27;s a couple dozen images needing to be converted one at a time. In addition, we&#x27;re starting to see the format pop up more often with remote folks sending in photos of forms with PII on them, so online converters are completely out of the question. 
 Any help or ideas would be appreciated.

                              <span>My cabling desires have led me to leveraging top-of-rack (TOR) switches instead of our typical home-running of everything back to centralized Ethernet and Fibre Channel core switches. Things were quite simple before, boy does this add some complexity and consideration for someone new to this topology.
 Before the edge TOR’s came into play, physical links and zoning defined redundancy and boundaries, ALUA did its magic ensuring utilization of optimal paths.

                              <span>hey all, 
 you guys have any recommendations for a good reliable wireless office headset? my company is a medium size staffing firm of about 170 employees, all using softphones on their laptops. the offices tend to get a bit crowded on certain days so I want to avoid bluetooth devices. 
 right now, we have about half Jabra engage 65s (great headset but discontinued and expensive) and the other half are yealink WH62s (constant problems with the mic or speakers not working, and confusing for users). 
 is there any modern DECT headset that doesnt suck?

 I dont mind setting up each one individually and prefer a free solution as this is a very small business.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get CodeTwo&#x27;s Exchange Online Picture manager installed, when I try to authenticate with my admin 365 account, it gives me this: 
 AADSTS700016: Application with identifier &#x27;[app id identifier i didn&#x27;t setup]&#x27; was not found in the directory &#x27;[companyname]&#x27;. This can happen if the application has not been installed by the administrator of the tenant or consented to by any user in the tenant. You may have sent your authentication request to the wrong tenant. 
 I&#x27;ve tried a combination of looking on CodeTwos troubleshooting forums and install guides and most of them are for installing the paid software and creating an app registration in Azure. Even if I create an app registration in azure for CodeTwo and assign the permissions the guide says, I don&#x27;t see a way to connect that app registration to code two since registering an app automatically generates an app ID that&#x27;s different from the one displayed in that error message with no way to change it. 
 My question is, how am I supposed to register an application in Azure that isn&#x27;t in the Azure App Library when I can&#x27;t assign the applications identifier to that registration, as well as not being able to change the identifier of the application because I didn&#x27;t make it. (All the guides on how to change an app ID seem to be to the tune of &quot;adjust it in the code&quot;) 
 I was looking into it potentially being a misconfigured consent issue, since we don&#x27;t get the &quot;The app needs the following permissions&quot; and &quot;Consent on behalf of your organization page&quot;, but I&#x27;m not exactly clear on how to enable that either. 
 Any help from the hivemind is greatly appreciated.

 The Kerberos client received a KRB_AP_ERR_MODIFIED error from the server olddc$. The target name used was cifs/OLDDC.TCH.local. This indicates that the target server failed to decrypt the ticket provided by the client. This can occur when the target server principal name (SPN) is registered on an account other than the account the target service is using. Ensure that the target SPN is only registered on the account used by the server. This error can also happen if the target service account password is different than what is configured on the Kerberos Key Distribution Center for that target service. Ensure that the service on the server and the KDC are both configured to use the same password. If the server name is not fully qualified, and the target domain (.LOCAL) is different from the client domain (.LOCAL), check if there are identically named server accounts in these two domains, or use the fully-qualified name to identify the server.

After the interviews, was told they want to make me an offer and we negotiated a salary that we both agreed too. Was told almost two weeks ago that everything looked good and they would work on getting an official offer letter out.
 Since then, no offer letter has been sent. I&#x27;ve emailed both the IT and Hiring manager and have gotten no response. Fearing the worst.
 Anyone else have something similar happen to them?

The stipulation being that it&#x27;s an apprentice engineer, which could mean extra work for us, but fingers crossed!
 Just need to figure out how to interview for an apprentice role now, weirdly harder than trying to find someone who isn&#x27;t there for a schooling

                              <span>TL;DR
 I work as an online developer for a large tech company (+20k employees worldwide).
 As a basically Windows-only shop, how difficult is it for a company like this to allow and authorize Linux dev machines?
 I imagine there are security considerations (patching/updates) and other stuff. Is it reasonable that they give us a &quot;hard no&quot; on this request?
 Background (if you want more details):
 Many of us prefer to work in a native Linux environment, but this is not authorized by our company. Since pretty much have free reign over our dev machines, some of us have installed Linux in dual boot. Others use a Linux bootable USB.
 These actions aren&#x27;t authorized by IT, but so far, our local IT guys have been sympathetic and have adopted a &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell&quot; kind of attitude, which works for us.
 Many devs don&#x27;t want to risk it, and use WSL. Most complain about it all day (stability, perf, etc..)
 We&#x27;d like to stop working in the shadows and get official authorization from our IT dept. We&#x27;re wondering if they&#x27;re just &quot;lazy/inept&quot;, or if supporting Linux in a large company like this is prohibitively complex/expensive.

                              <span>Upfront - I&#x27;m underwhelmed by antivirus and EDR providers. Perhaps I&#x27;m suffering from working in a small company (just 100 endpoints), so maybe the products are better than my experiences so far.
 We are with Cybereason, currently on NGAV but due to replace with EDR in September. The support has been awful. For example, Cybereason is currently detecting itself (coreminion.dll) as being Malware (https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/cve-2020-1472-zerologon-security-advisory/). But only on one machine. I&#x27;ve seen other examples of legit software flagged on a handful of our endpoints, but not on most. It&#x27;s just so wildly inconsistent, despite everything being in the same policy group, updated, and so on.
 Crowdstrike - looked promising, but awful sales experience. I&#x27;ve been blunt about how our purchasing decisions are made (we have an annual budget - if it isn&#x27;t in that, it&#x27;s not happening) and given windows when it&#x27;s good to speak (i.e. two months before I confirm my budget for next year!). This doesn&#x27;t stop me being harassed by calls and emails, including one rather embarrassing &quot;My manager said I&#x27;m in trouble for giving you this price, but I can honour it if you buy now!&quot; call.
 Watchguard - support was absolutely appalling, and their Panda EDR client trashed our Linux laptops.
 So, two questions:
  
Have I just been unfortunate with Cybereason - are those on the EDR or MDR solution finding a more pleasant time. What is your feedback?
 Are AV providers just shitty, or is it because we&#x27;re such a small account? Would we be better using a MSSP? I&#x27;m wary of MSSPs because I&#x27;ve worked for a few MSPs who have tried their hand at security, and I&#x27;d not trust them anywhere near our small estate.
  
I&#x27;d be grateful for thoughts.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I have noticed that there is a lot of regular usage for Skype for Business within Discovered Apps in Cloud Discover within security.micorosft.com.
 Skype for Business is not installed and shouldn&#x27;t be used by any user.
 A new users with a freshly built laptop is also logging Skype for Business usage, when they have only used Teams.
 Here&#x27;s my question. Is this the Microsoft portal reporting Teams calls as Skype? I cant find anything anywhere online to prove it either way!
 Thanks in advance!!!

                              <span>Hello,
 I am struggling a bit to find the fastest way to delete mail from people&#x27;s mailboxes when there is a security incident. For the past two weeks we have had multiple comprised users falling for phishing. We have monthly simulations, have phishing set to aggressive block in M365, various endpoint lockdowns, external header flagging, external banner flagging, the MS setting that says, &quot;you don&#x27;t regular get mail from this person, etc.&quot; We also block many top level domains in DNS filter, block new domain, etc. If anything the complaints from the execs and users are &quot;too much email security.&quot;
 Despite all this, stuff comes through. M365 will alert us but unless it is in quarantine, I can&#x27;t find a way to easily delete it for box that it exists in. What &#x27;sometimes&#x27; works is
 ​
  
Connect-ExchangeOnline
  
Connect-IPPSSession -UserPrincipalName  * New-ComplianceSearch -name &quot;suspicious emails&quot; -ExchangeLocation all -ContentMatchQuery &#x27;subject:&quot;suspicious&quot;&#x27; * Start-ComplianceSearch “suspicious emails” * New-ComplianceSearchAction -SearchName “suspicious emails” -purge -purgetype SoftDelete/HardDelete
 This is cumbersome and does not always complete due to powershell errors and/or our team rushing to get it done fast. Last night it would not accept the &#x27;purge&#x27; argument for reasons I did not determine. I also need to set the security to &quot;winrm basic&quot; to run this and then change it back again when done.
 reference https://www.codetwo.com/admins-blog/new-compliancesearch-new-version-of-search-mailbox/
 I am also trying to delete from Trace \ go hunt for this message&quot; \ &quot;advanced hunting&quot; and though I find the mail and take action to delete it, it does not appear to delete.
 What I am looking for is to the fastest way, ideally through the GUI, to locate all mails from a sender and /or subject and delete.
 Thx!

                              <span>Hi All,
 We use Veeam. I am considering moving away from tapes to immutable storage for our &quot;offline&quot; backups. I was wondering how many of us have done that, and what your experience and comfort level with that decision has been.
 Thank you!

                              <span>Greetings fellow sysadmins,
 I’m looking to find a good solution for storing secure documents. For clarification, these are not physical documents. These are things like word docs that have all of our server configuration information; data center documents with our network diagrams, firewall info, etc.; and even documents where we keep things like vendor account information. 
 I know with 365 we can set document restrictions, but that just doesn’t feel like enough. So, what are you all using to store these sensitive documents in a place that can be set up with access lists for team members? Any and all suggestions welcome at this point.

                              <span>Hello,
 Been struggling lately with a project. Everything is behind NDA with too small group knowing about it and it&#x27;s starts to affect the performance. There is just too much to do in a small time window, that I&#x27;m getting the feeling that we have to either:
 a) attain more people to help on project
 b) postpone some aspects for later implementation, but that would be seen as bad plannig on my end 
 but..
 a) C-level don&#x27;t want to involve any more people. Straight up no, just drop the topic.
 b) Deadline is set. There is some serious $$ involved and I&#x27;m sure they would rather fail partly and fix it after the deadline.. but that would be my problem to fix later on , while they will put the blame one someone else. 
 Another idea was to persuade most of project members to my ideas, but that takes time, which is running out. My question is how do you find a workaround in those situations and go with how you propose? 
 P.S. and please, no &quot;CY@/leave as see what they do&quot;, cause in the end, when the milk was already spilled and you get the blame or bad looks it&#x27;s already too late, since there seems to be distrust whether you are capable of working on bigger projects..

                              <span>I’m considering changing part of my approach to how I manage filtering of DNS and web requests. 
 I currently have EDR software installed on all workstations and DNS filtering software in place, however, I still see phishing from the plethora of new TLD’s. In particular, the whole .zip and .mov TLD debacle got me thinking.
 Don’t get me wrong, the spam filters GENERALLY catch the phishing, but they’re not 100% and I really like defense in depth.
 I’d like to change to whitelisting TLD’s instead of blacklisting. Obvious I’d need the usual suspects like .com, .gov, .mil, national domain’s etc. I’d probably also add some of the newer ones that actually see some legit traffic like .museum. 
 Has anyone done this? What lessons did you learn and what pitfalls should I watch out for?
 Thanks!

Any reason why this is happening? Is it on the server end? Or something is wrong with the client.

 The same 51GB file copied to a mount point (C:\clusterstorage\volume1) transfers at 410MB/s and takes minutes. 
 It&#x27;s the same thing with exporting a VM. Anything on the mountpoint is slow. Anything on a mapped drive is really fast and it&#x27;s tested on different hosts in different sites. 
 It&#x27;s the same situation on a cluster in a different site and MPIO is configured as per the SAN vendor&#x27;s documentation. 
 Hoping someone will have some suggestions.

There&#x27;s also a great deal of content out there that violates our advertising/promotion rule, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos.
 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

                              <span>Just wondered what everyone&#x27;s preference was, do you use 365 desktop apps or online? Indeed the advantages of both but have been using online only for the last few months. The only thing I sometimes find irritating is if I&#x27;m working on something from our on prem server , I need to upload to one drive or SharePoint to open it. 
 Oh and teams isn&#x27;t eating up resources.

                              <span>Hiya guys, I have recently started a job at a new IT company and I&#x27;m about 3 months in. I&#x27;m really liking it and want to progress in to Internal IT when I&#x27;m off my probation. 
 Is there a rough guideline of what Certifications or Knowledge I&#x27;d need to have to get on to the Internal IT team? I have a massive curiosity for Sysadmin work and I&#x27;m really interested in AD. 
 I also have a massive wealth of knowledge in Hardware both Consumer and Professional (Servers, Blade Servers etc.) 
 As for trying to find out about requirements internally I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m in a position to ask about that considering how new I am. 
 Cheers lads.

                              <span>Hello, I want to ask whether some of you have an experience with resetting passwords from printer Sharp MX-4141N and MX-301W. A previous admin has changed all the passwords and unfortunately didn&#x27;t sync them correctly, which means all the passwords weren&#x27;t saved. I have found a video on YouTube where someone can reset passwords by opening a case and switching off a button on motherboard of a printer. I don&#x27;t really know if that can work but I suppose so. Any other ideas would be appreciated, because a technician wants 200 dollar pro printer and we don&#x27;t have that much money. Thank you all

                              <span>Found out that the previous sysadmin handled to a vendor a server to &quot;do admin stuff&quot; for their application. Told me, before resigning, that &quot;they manage it so don&#x27;t worry&quot;.
 Yea sure. I never logged on to it as i thought it was actually managed (this was my mistake)
 Since it was 2012r2 (we are in the process of upgrading) i logged on today with my admin credentials... and they don&#x27;t work. I check the documentation and find out that there is a password. 
 Obviously .\administrator.
 Turns out:
 The server is not joined to the domain, no windows license configured, just one dns, local administrator, no antivirus, UAC disabled, no antivirus, last windows patch january 2020, anydesk installed.
 A poster for worst practice.
 Will be nuked today.

                              <span>Hi Reddit Hoping you can help me out. I’ve been given last min work and I’ve not been involved in the project. We are certifying for cyber essential plus and I have a few questions around the audit it’s self. I can’t get out of this as it some thing they are doing 
 Q1. Colleague access 365 services from personal devices, we control access by in tune MEM. With additional policy’s around OS levels. Colleagues require to authenticate one a week with MFA. Would it be fair in saying on the day of the audit only devices that have accessed info on that week would be under scope? If so what testing do they actually under go. We allow iOS, andriod and windows devices to access info this way. 
 Q2. The requirements are that os levels be up todate, but looking more in to requirements is it fair to say that andriod 11 would be complaint Os as this is still recieving support ?

 Looking to get ahead of the curve on this before it gets enabled, has anyone got wind of methods to disable Windows copilot being automatically installed? I imagine there&#x27;ll be a KB numbered update to block.

                              <span>Hello, I hope I can have help around my question as I am fighting on for days. Forgive me my broken English also.
 Due to organizational matter, In my company we need to see/list in udadmin into our license server only the devices connected, not the users. Surfing for days around the net I understand that it probably depends on the License Type and on how are installed.
 The strange thing is that a couple of those device we have are already listed like this and they connect/show as device (thin clients) without listing the username as well. For the rest we use also windows laptops as well so we have a mix. We own a Citrix On-Prem server where the employees connect to their desktop via ICA/Receiver.
 Is there a way to re-install the license and associate it per device and not per user on the physical machine? Any hints? Citrix Inc. seems like to be very conservative and limited about it, and I couldn’t find much around the net.
 Thank you! 😊

 Edit: There&#x27;s a more recent energize update from 08:22, 3.2.3.109198 - installed that and it seems to have fixed the issue.

 Let’s say replacing the system is not an option and running a new cable is not an option, what are some ways I can extend the wireless network? The solution doesn’t have to be super cheap but would want to keep it under 500/600. 
 Are there any decent Wi-Fi extenders or something out there?

 Say you got an old NetApp (Release 9.1P10) filer that serves data to a bunch of clients (via CIFS, NFS, iSCSI, etc). You have no idea what servers/VMs/machines use that storage, but you need to find out. What is the easiest way to do that? Can you see that from the NetApp cli or gui?

                              <span>Hi,
 we have small issue with some contacts. We using a 3rd party software that syncs a global addressbook to an addional addressbook for each user (mainly for reverse number lookup for iOS).
 These contacts have filled the &quot;file as&quot; field with &quot;surname, name&quot;. I can see that in each vCard and in some contacts in the default list overview. But not in all.
 If i open the vcard, safe as an other format its directly shown. 
 Its not a bug in the software. We checked that with the vendor. Did anybody of you have an idea?
 Thanks.

 Have you guys ever come across these guys? How did you respond?

                              <span>I recently replaced a Cisco switch with a Fortinet 148F and can not get the 9951 phone expansion modules working. The phones display a message that they are unable to power the accessory. I reached out to Fortinet and it sounded as though there may be a known bug but the workaround they provided didn&#x27;t resolve anything. I have a number of switches to replace and don&#x27;t want to run into this issue at future sites. Has anyone come across this?

 One of my sites is supporting unmanaged, air-gapped, flat networks just to satisfy a vendor who frankly appears to be stuck in 1988. No spanning-tree, no vlan tags, etc

                              <span>Anyone here have any experience with Nokia 7360 OLT&#x27;s and them doing IGMP proxy back to edge routers? We use 7750&#x27;s here, but any routers really? I am being told by Nokia that the 7360&#x27;s will only allow the proxy to be configured to remove the SSM source that the settop STB sends to the OLT, and change the IGMP joins to *,G joins, and therefore we must do IGMP translations on the edge routers to get them back to SSM IGMP joins, and that is the standard for NOKIA and all ISP do it that way.
 Anyone doing this today and not doing it this way, or doing it this way?
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;ve never understood how this could be possible, maybe you folks have some ideas. It&#x27;s not an issue at present but a problem I never got an answer to. We would see this usually when a specific firewall model was about to fail and starts acting buggy and shortly after totally dead (needing reboots and dropping connections the weeks leading up to failure sort of thing). Seen the exact scenario at least 3 times with this hardware.
 Anyhow when the FW would have it&#x27;s issues devices on the LAN would also stop working bringing, basically the entire switch is affected for locally hosted programs that typically continue to work when internet is down otherwise. We replace the FW with a new model all is fine of course, but it&#x27;s alwaysbleft me confused.
 My question though is how is the L3 firewall/gateway managing to screw up a dumb switch for L2 communication? I understand while it&#x27;s having issues internet may not work but this phenomenon feels like it violates everything I learned about the OSI model?? 
 I can only think something with ARP getting messed up or basically FW overloading the switch and basically DoS it? 
 Simple flat layout. Single LAN/24, dumb switch, no VLANs, nothing crazy configuration-wise

                              <span>Hi all, Happy Friday and all that jazz.
 Have any of you smart folks out there deployed these CBS350 switches from Cisco?
 I&#x27;ve recently deployed a 2x CBS350-48FP-4X stack and the CPU is pinned at 100% during production hours. There&#x27;s a 2x CBS350-24FP-4X stack in the same location with an almost identical config and that thing is fine.
 I usually work with IOS derived devices but this seems to be an &quot;ROS&quot; device and the usual &#x27;show process cpu sorted&#x27; etc commands don&#x27;t exist.
 This problem exists on 3.2 and 3.3 (the latest as of writing this) firmwares.
 The stack is based in a hub office and the config isn&#x27;t complicated, it has 9 APs, 2 firewalls in HA, 2 routers in HA, a couple of door entry controllers, a cctv dvr, a couple of ACLs and 1 static route. There are no cameras plugged into …</span>

                              <span>Hi i have made a link between two switch&#x27;s across buildings however i seem to be missing the default vlan1 on the trunk port (1/50)
 ​
 i - Internal untagged, I - Internal tagged, v - VLT untagged, V - VLT tagged
 NUM Status Description Q Ports
 * 1 Active &quot;Default_vlan&quot; U Gi 1/1,1/3-1/40
 2 Active &quot;DMZ&quot; T Gi 1/47-1/48
 T Te 1/49-1/50
 T Gi 2/47-2/48
 If i create port 2 in vlan2 i get an expected ip so im convinced its todo with vlan1 not showing untagged 1/50?
 ​
 any idea how to add vlan1 to port 1/50?
 ​
 I travel home in 2 hours so sorry for the clickbait title

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m looking for some sort of routing-protocol or other function/mechanic that can solve my following problem:
 I have an HQ and a side-branch (SB). They are connected via EtherLink (~ 200km distance).
 Basically all VLANS are L2 transparent connected between both sides, giving me the same IP Address-space, WiFi-Networks, etc... over both locations.
 All inter-VLAN Routing takes place on the Core-Switch at HQ. Internet Connection is also only at HQ. Any connections to the internet from SB goes through HQ.
 In the event that the EtherLink goes down, Inter-VLAN routing at SB is not possible anymore. How can I make Inter-VLAN routing possible at the Core-Switch at SB in the case that the EtherLink to HQ goes down? Internet Connectivity is not a requirement in this case.
 €dit: I should mention that I&#x27;m using a HPE 10504 as the Core@HQ and a HPE FlexFabric 5940 as Core@SB. Other switches on both sides are all HPE. Mostly 5510 and 5130.

                              <span>So we have this one IP that&#x27;s being used for FiveM GTA V with an anti DDoS service. Each time the IP got attacked with DDoS (which got filtered by the anti DDoS service), we&#x27;d then receive abuse notice by email which says that the IP is doing a network scan / network attack to a lot of IPs which they listed in that email. It&#x27;s our IP that&#x27;s getting attacked by DDoS but why are we receiving that kind of email?

                              <span>Planning network config for a small company - setting up one office in the UK and one in India, will have 1-2 APs at each for now (max 5-6 users at each). No on-prem servers, everything in the cloud. 1 Gbps symmetric fiber at both sites.
 Easy management is key, as I will usually be thousands of miles away from either office (and overseeing IT is maybe 5% of my job) - so a single pane of glass for routers/FWs/APs would be great if possible.
 Somewhat budget conscious - would be great to avoid hefty subscription costs if possible.
 Among prosumer-ish stuff, I don&#x27;t trust Ubiquiti beyond their APs, and TP-Link Omada likely won&#x27;t be acceptable in this particular application.
 Thoughts on Engenius, which seems to have a single pane cloud solution with their ESG510 gateway + APs?
 Or I guess could give up the single pane and do, say, Aruba InstantOn for APs and something else for FWs (maybe Fortinet FortiGate 60F/70F?). Any other reasonable FW options?
 Any other ideas?

                              <span>I am a former DevOps guy, and bought some commercial real estate. Looking to setup wifi and network across a 25k SF multi-tenant building. Cinderblock walls that are concrete filled, so signal doesn&#x27;t travel well between units. Looking for suggestions on best &quot;cheap used enterprise&quot; hardware to look at. Don&#x27;t have much experience with Cisco, Aruba, Arista, etc. Read dozens of threads and can&#x27;t tell whats legit and what&#x27;s a Ford vs Chevy thing. Tried using 30 Google WiFi routers in topology described below and it failed horribly. Tenants are mom and pop so just needing basic wifi across the building plus extensive security system cause building is in the ghetto. 
 Cat6 to each unit from roof, forming wired backbone of one hard-wired AP per unit into 2-3 48 port POE switches. Add more wireless APs in each unit to form a hybrid mesh network without have to run more Cat6 everywhere. Wired backbone would also contain dozens of POE security cameras. Wired backbone would have a few switches spread geographically aross the building (left, right, center) and all connected by SPF uplinks.
 I want to avoid licensing fees and recurring costs. Ideally I can buy cheap enterprise hardware on ebay/offerup, link it all up, write a script or two for configuration (or click some buttons on a web portal) and be done. If need to expand, buy more of the same used gear then plug and play to expand the network. Don&#x27;t want to worry about getting bricked out because a vendor discontinues some cloud product or because my license expired or I didn&#x27;t buy from approved vendors. Also confused on the internal vs external wireless controller -- seems like sometimes thay is part of the AP and other times it is seperate?
 What brands/models do you all recommend and why? Give me a shopping list that can get it done as cheap, easy and robust as possible. I like the idea of buying used in bulk and then developing a scalable I can replicate on any future building I buy.

                              <span>In your opinion, does it make more sense to consolidate resources into separate resource groups based off resource type? Example:
 ​
 Databases - rg-databases
 Servers - rg-servers
 Linux - rg-linux
 Keyvaults - rg-keyvault
 NICs - rg-nics
 vnet - rg-virtualnetwork
 NSG - rg-nsg
 automation accounts - rg-automation
 ​
 Or would it make more sense to do something similar, but consolidate NSG, Vnet, etc into a rg such as rg-networking?
 ​
 Or combine resources that are used for each other, I.E a VM with a NIC, vnet, nsg, etc?
 ​
 Can you give me examples of how you do it?

                              <span>We are doing vendor evaluation for a 800K software solution. We are down to the last 3 vendors and are doing final technical evaluations and pricing negotiations.
 One vendor has some shady AF tactics by sending us depreciation notices for competitors, for products we&#x27;re even evaluating. There&#x27;s some other mud slinging shenanigans that are just underhanded and not professional.
 The second doesn&#x27;t meet several of our core criteria, so they&#x27;re already disqualified, but have the best price. 
 The third bone head is borderline harassing my staff calling and texting several times a day. We&#x27;re a slow decision making process because of the cost, and won&#x27;t let up. Then he drops the bombshell that he&#x27;s desperate to make the sale because he&#x27;ll lose his job if he doesn&#x27;t close with us.
 Now I&#x27;m left with an ethics problem that may disqualify this vendor. And the swarmy sales guy makes me want to ditch the first. Ugh... I don&#x27;t ever remember purchasing being this hard. 
 Now what do I do?

                              <span>I recently took on a small companies IT and to say the least it was a dumpster fire. They use intune which I&#x27;ve never used before and I don&#x27;t get the time or resources to properly test things before deploying them. Which of course has led to issues already. I&#x27;m trying to learn intune as best and as fast as I can but who knows how long that&#x27;ll take. I&#x27;ve never been solo before with this much responsibility. Do you have any advice on how to best approach this and deal with stress that comes from it?

                              <span>I was trying to add 2fa to ssh in our oracle cloud server.
 And got locked out coz something didn&#x27;t work and I tried to ssh many times, thus making fail2ban kill my existing ssh connection.
 Thought I could just ask my friend who also has ssh access to the server, turns out he didn&#x27;t even setup an ssh-key even tho I told him to do so before I closed off password authentication.
 none of the oracle cloud control panel&#x27;s console shell or run command option were working for some reason
 I freakin make a recovery instance, detached the boot volume of the broken server, attached it to the recovery instance, fixed the config, and then re-attached the boot volume where it belonged
 It may not sound like much but I&#x27;m just 17 and have no professional courses or certificates when it comes to oracle cloud (or any other cloud) and sysadmin.
 I feel so confident on my sysadmin skills.
 After this I don&#x27;t feel like a kiddo when I say that I&#x27;m a decent sysadmin.

                              <span>Sorry for long post, I&#x27;m thinking about this for a week now, and I don&#x27;t have anyone to talk to.
 So here is a situation, after 3 years of different admins doing shit they didn&#x27;t document, it is my turn to have fun. I recently got promoted from help desk, because 2 admins left.
 And here comes the fun part.
 All Managers are in DA group. There is a Local Admin policy but it is linked to whole domain. Admin rights are given using restricted groups policy.
 My plan to fix this mess is to create 3 groups. Workstation admins, Developers, Server admins. Also 3 policies one to link to workstations OU, second also to workstations (but restrict it to apply only to developers Desktops) and third to server OU.
 I will create separate accounts for administration and add them to groups.
 Workstation admins will be 2 of our helpdesk guys, I will also give them righs to add PC to domain.
 Developers will be all Developers (don&#x27;t ask me why, they cry to the management if they don&#x27;t get admin rights. And they love them more since they make money)
 Server admins will be me, 1 colleague and CEO
 And I will leave only Domain Administrator in DA group and restrict access to all machines except Domain Controllers.
 First question is do you think that this plan is good? Do you have any other advice?
 Second question is, since a lot of members of DA group and Local Admin group are already logged in to some Workstations and Servers, and they won&#x27;t lose admin access on those machines untill I restart them. What is a best way to remove them without reboot, but also apply new policies?

                              <span>Seeing the other topic about emails reminded me of this happening last week. 
 User tells me an email to a government agency never made it there in time, and that it is going to cost us funding money. They want me to go look in the system and see if it ever left Exchange. They had sent it the week before, closed up shop and went on vacation.
 Check Exchange, and sure enough it did not go through on the day in question, but on the day they called me. So it looks like it didn&#x27;t leave the mailbox, went into outgoing, they prematurely closed up the machine before it sent and went home. I explain this to them, and they tell me that because they use a Mac, and heard the &quot;Swoosh&quot; sound, they knew it sent.
 Wrong. I have the proof that it didn&#x27;t send. Here&#x27;s the proof.
 Not good enough, they had me expand the parameters, check the system again, so I did. I humored them. It&#x27;s then that I notice that the email had a second recipient: The sender.
 &quot;Did you CC yourself in the email as well?&quot;
 &quot;Yes Mikash33, I did.&quot;
 &quot;I see. Did you receive the email before today?&quot;
 &quot;No, I didn&#x27;t.&quot;
 &quot;OK, so think about that for a moment; You sent this very important email to them and yourself, didn&#x27;t get your copy, and didn&#x27;t think to check if it sent until a week later?&quot;
 Silence on the phone. Checks watch, 10 seconds go by before I bust out: &quot;Is there anything else I can help you with today?&quot;

                              <span>I just started a new job (that I absolutely love so far) as a system admin. They don’t have a ticketing system. They want to use Salesforce as a ticketing system. Not the ticketing system that Salesforce has (Desk.com or whatever) but Salesforce itself. 
 If anyone has any experience with using Salesforce as a ticketing system, please tell me pros/cons and if you don’t, what ticketing system would you recommend?
 Edit: Further info, we already have Salesforce and a Salesforce Admin, who is the one that recommended Salesforce cases as our ticketing system.

 User: I’m not really sure. Can you check all places that deliver pizzas?
 Me: No I don’t even know all the places that deliver pizza. You need to narrow it down.

                              <span>Interesting article about tech companies cutting benefits.
 I myself watched as the company I wrapped up my long career up with, a company with billion dollar annual profits, slowly but very steadily chip away at every benefit from healthcare to office conditions over the last several years. Looking back I was glad to have been there &quot;during the good times&quot; and was sad to see newer, younger coworkers not even have the frame of reference to understand just how much they were getting screwed and commoditized despite not actually being commodities. 
 In hindsight some of the primary reasons the company got away with it was their &quot;thousand small cuts over time&quot; approach, and the total failure of employees, especially the older and more senior ones, to collectively push back in an organized fashion. I&#x27;m not saying to Unionize (and I&#x27;m not saying not to, either), but it&#x27;s clear that todays Fortune 500 companies operate under the exploit and push until something breaks model of staffing and operations, just as they do with most everything else. And if you&#x27;re quiet and kill yourself to make moving that goalpost successful for the company, then it will probably be at your expense.

Nothing seem to get rid of this error.She viewing files at 75% zoom for the most part so adjusting it to 100% or some other zoom would be a bit insufficient as it would be harder to view due to the resolution. Either getting this error or blank pages with random PDFs. Anyone have any ideas?

Everything has been working fine for quite a while, however one of our apps is externally linking to Google Maps and that site no longer works in IE Mode. In MS technet, it states: 
 &quot; This policy gives you time to identify and configure all of the authentication servers used by your IE mode sites. &quot;
 Have any of you identifies all of the &quot;authentication servers&quot; in your environment? What is the level of difficulty and what tools did you use?

                              <span>To reduce the IT Overhead at our company, we are swapping everyone from Verizon to ATT.
 Verizon - $40/month
 ATT - $25/Month
 Both have unlimited text/call/data with data reducing speeds for individual if they go over 50GB/month.
 I have tried to call and negotiate with Verizon on dropping us down to match ATT, but they dont seem to be budging. Ive already swapped around 100 from Verizon. Still around 250 to go. Anyone have a similar experience or were you able to get more reasonable rates at Verizon?

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I&#x27;ve come across a problem with our D-Link DGS-3120-48TC switches. We have three stacked together and I had set one port to a VLAN (L2 Features -&gt; VLAN -&gt; 802.1Q VLAN Settings) and also enabled the guest VLAN on that port as well (Security -&gt; 802.1X -&gt; Guest VLAN Settings), so that a device that doesn&#x27;t get authenticated by 802.1X, it automatically gets put into the guest VLAN. 
 Now, I removed the guest VLAN setting and wanted to configure the same port to a new VLAN while also removing it from the first VLAN. This, however, shows the error &quot;The guest VLAN member port cannot be configured.&quot; This only happens when trying to assign it to VLAN 1. Every other VLAN works, but I need the PC attached in VLAN 1 x)
 Has anyone stumbled upon this as well and can lead me in the right direction?

                              <span>I don&#x27;t think our network is infallible. Once in a while, sure, it&#x27;s something on our network! But I&#x27;ve been spending a ridiculous amount of time lately trying to prove to third party support that various issues are not &quot;network problems&quot;. It&#x27;s their default go-to and it&#x27;s pissing me off.
 These are examples that have taken a ridiculous amount of my time over just the past month:
  
New POS system at a remote location, network blamed for equipment going down for several days. Turns out to be a licensing renewal issue on their end. No apologies for their mistake. It ended up happening AGAIN at another location later.
 MDM system stops allowing certain IT staff to enroll mobile devices properly. &quot;Must be something you did on your end&quot; - ends up being a change they made on their end.
 SSO for a third-party app stops working randomly one night - &quot;Must be a network issue on your end&quot; - spend hours trying to troubleshoot and nothing our end changed, turns out to be a bad coding change on their end.
 Outlook add-in for large CRM stops working for certain employees, but not others. &quot;It&#x27;s your Outlook version&quot; - prove that it isn&#x27;t by having a user with access to all orgs try all in the same instance of Outlook. This is still a pending issue and can&#x27;t get them to accept responsibility.
  
I know I&#x27;m preaching to the choir here but I&#x27;m so sick of it. Wasting all kinds of time trying to prove to first level support dumbasses that read scripts all day to let me talk to someone who knows what the hell they&#x27;re talking about. Even escalating just leads to more dumbasses that won&#x27;t accept responsibility for issues.

                              <span>We have Adobe Reader on most of our systems because one of the main applications that we use here requires it. The only problem is the company that makes the software wants us to run very old versions of Adobe Reader because of compatibility with their product. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s laziness on their end but not being able to update our PDF software is a risk on our end. I know the normal response is usually get another vendor, but trust me when I tell you this is not an option.
 I&#x27;m worried about PDF attachments that come through email. I am really at a loss how to handle this. Keep AR at older versions but protect against email attachments. Just saying it makes me feel stupid. I know the answer is &quot;you want to keep a vulnerable version of AR but you want to security as well?&quot; I hear you. I&#x27;m just looking for possible solutions right now. How would you guys handle this email issue? Thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;m not a cryptography expert, nor am I a sysadmin. But I&#x27;m playing around with PKI (mostly mostly client auth/sign), but I think a relatable example that most sysadmins will get is PKI use for S/MIME.
 Yes, you can pay $50/email address to some certificate authority, but many will also roll out their own PKI. It all depends on the use case of course, do you just need non-repudiation for internal use, or do you want outside recipients to verify emails.
 But it&#x27;s 2023. Let&#x27;s Encrypt lets you get DV certificates for free, but those certificates only support TLS server/client authentication EKUs.
 Why can&#x27;t we have free validated S/MIME certificates (and other types of certificates)?
 Why can&#x27;t we have our own CA for a domain, and have our &quot;local root&quot; signed by a &quot;real&quot; CA just like any other intermediate CA, so we can generate our own certificates that work on our own domains? Servers would need to also serve intermediate certificates that are under our control so the chain can be fully built since those links are missing in browser/computer root stores, but that&#x27;s just a few extra bytes.

                              <span>A client has 3 licenses of a software which are shared on 5 computers. According to the license it is ok to share those licenses (up to 2 users per each license), however cannot be used simultaneously.
 Obviously the users forget to close the software one they are finished and just leave it running in the background, thus blocking others who need to launch it on their computers.
 Is there a way to detect when a process has been idle for more than 15 minutes, so that we can then run a command to kill the process from memory?
 I tried using PowerShell but it seems that there is no property which gives how long the process has been idle.
 Maybe someone out there knows of a software that can reliably monitor a specified process for this type of scenario.
 Thanks!

                              <span>So we recently had a major problem with an DPM server going down (We suspect an windows update gone corrupt) 
 Now the server is semi stable and it never freezes or crashes HOWEVER now the DPM just outright stops at random I&#x27;ve checked the eventlog which pointed me towards REFS.
 The errors we are getting before it hangs is: ID 129 - vhdmp and ID 51 - disk
 We have implemented the REFS fixes that Microsoft recommends to no avail.
 Nothing have been changed on the server since this error started to occur (it have been running for approx. 3 months)
 Some info about the server: Windows Server 2022 - updated to latest Microsoft SQL 2022 - updated to latest DPM 2022 - updated to latest.
 The DPM disk is 40TB and is running through Think system raid 9350 card.
 Anyone that can point me in the right direction?

                              <span>Hi
 I am putting a bunch of new desktop computers into a laboratory where noise must be kept to a minimum. Because of this, the computers live in a separate room from the monitors and keyboards which must be connected over CAT 6 cables in the walls.
 Does anyone know of a reliable (and hopefully affordable) brand of adapters which can take the USB (keyboard and mouse) and Displayport (monitors) connections and put them onto the CAT6 cables?

                              <span>Hi All
 We have come across this weird issue auto signing into Edge default profile . Currently we deploy devices using on premise MDT. When a device joins the domain, it checks in with Group Policy and applies the following user GPs
 • Force users to sign-in to use the browser
 • Configure whether a user always has a default profile automatically signed in with their work or school account
 • Force synchronization of browser data and do not show the sync consent prompt
 • Hide the First-run experience and splash screen
 This works great and Edge signs in perfectly. 
 We are 99% setup now with Intune – albeit hybrid – I know the consensus on this is not ideal, but we have it working perfectly with AOVPN and bar a few hacky things, its works reliably. The same GPs are in play, Same OUs and …</span>

                              <span>This might seem very odd. But my isp is telling me that a ping of 240ms+ (some times up to 320) between servers here (Melbourne Australia) and servers in New York (Ithica) is &quot;normal&quot; the time jump when doing a trace rout from NY only jumps from like 12ms to 240ms when it hits the backbone routers in Indonesia before like 4 more hops to our servers here. 
 Does this in fact seem &quot;normal&quot; ... or am I loosing my brain ? Having issues with apps timing out because of this... ISP is trying to tell me that sort of ping time is &quot;normal&quot; .. Ill shut up if it is.. just means I&#x27;m going to have to do a deep dive to fig out why things are now timing out between these two points when they have been running fine for years...

                              <span>so we got a few (I think 10) Teams licenses as part of our Legacy Silver partnership with M$ in 2021 and they expired this week. I understand that now if we want to continue to use it, we need to purchase the license, this is fine. But it looks like this type of license cannot be renewed for the same email address, it requires me to create new profile and my past conversations/history get (apparently) lost. Ever happened to any of you? What am I doing wrong?
 Is there a way to download conversation history from Teams if my license expired?

 Currently have a garbage Peplink Balance 20. Maxes at 150-200mbps throughput and really HIGH latency.
 Have about 15-20 users concurrently (up to 100 devices), all network traffic is mainly CRM/ERP software which is all web based and 15 or so VOIP Phones.
 Debating between Netsense, Fortinet, Cisco, etc. Want DUAL WAN capability with load balancing.
 Fortinet 60f or 80F is what I&#x27;ve been leaning more towards. What are you thoughts? Price is a main concern for owners, but quality is most important in terms of up time. This will be self administered and i&#x27;m a techy guy but we&#x27;re not doing anything fancy on the network.
 Just lots of traffic of all kinds, nothing huge data file wise, just mainly lost of secure web traffic for our cloud hosted CRM/ERP/ETC.
 Will need to add about 4-6 Wireless AP&#x27;s throughout the building so also something that has a Wireless AP solution would be great.

                              <span>Hey guys
 I have a strange behavior with a system I added to my Windows Server Hyper-V Failover Cluster in Server 2022.
 The servers have nearly the same configuration - the CPUs are a Intel Xeon Gold and Intel Xeon Silver:
 Cluster with Server 1 and Server 2 (the new Server).
 Behavior not working:
  
VM is on Server1 and I want to Live Migrate to Server 2
 not working, because of &quot;processor specific features&quot; - but the CPU compatibility mode from the VM is activated
  
Behavior working:
  
If I shutdown the VM and do a fast failover from Server 1 to Server 2 it&#x27;s working and I can start and work with the VM
 
If I do then a failover from Server 2 to Server 1 it&#x27;s working
 
A switch back from Server 1 to Server 2 is working as well
 
When the VM is on Server 2 I can restart and shutdown the VM and after starting again I&#x27;m able to live migrate to Server 1
 
 At this point it&#x27;s not working anymore:
  
When I shutdown or restart the VM on Server 1, I&#x27;m not able to do a failover to Server 2 (see behavior not working - processor specific features)
  
Server1 and Server2 have the same Hyper-V Manager settings and I already tried with a new, from scratch, installed Windows VM.
 Where is the difference? Why is the normal failover working as long as the machine is moved in shutdown state and failovered while it&#x27;s running until it&#x27;s shutdown/restart on a different server (Server 1).
 I found something about Bios/Driver differences but since both servers are not equal, I have differences.

 It just checks the &quot;Company Name&quot; and adds users to the group if they match. However we have some managers that also need to be added that have a different company name. Is there any way I can do this?

                              <span>Currently looking for a new backup solution and looks like the leading two are Rubrik and Commvault. We use a mix of VMware and Nutanix AHV which means Cohesity is out of the mix due to lack of full support for AHV. Due to funding any cloud-based DRAAS such as Commvault&#x27;s metallic is also not going to be considered.
 We already have Veeam so we know what that offers.
 Large Hospital and have about 1000 VMs with 150 Physical - more to be onboarded soon. Need on-site and cloud storage for backup copies.
 Has anyone used both Rubrik and Commvault? What do you recommend? I&#x27;ve heard they&#x27;re both great products but Commvault is a lot more complicated to set up and manage.

                              <span>I am on site doing a server replacement 3k miles from our home office. Went to swap the server our latest servers are these fanlesa custom unites that are low profile and all solid state, the have a pci e x4 slot with the back cut off of it but no way to mount a card at all as the chassis will not allow. The situation is that the client has a piece of software that is mission critical to be online from 10am-10pm, and the license key is currently a parallel key that is plugged into a parallel pci card in their current system. I only have a few days on site and need to find a workaround, I have that pcie x4 slot and USB basically are my only options to figure something out. Our newer stuff uses USB license keys and we can convert this one but it wouldn&#x27;t get done fast enough. Lastly I am in Anaheim so I have access to all of Anaheim and LA which may help my odds finding some adapter card or something locally thanks everyone.

                              <span>We have dozens of Windows 10 Enterprise laptops, all enrolled in Azure AD + Intune, that we want to wipe remotely with the script/app.
 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone has tested a method to perform a remote wipe, as we&#x27;ve spent a lot of time on the issue and have had little luck.
 We&#x27;ve been using Graph API calls, like the one below, experimenting with different commands and payloads. For 90% of our test cases, we&#x27;ve had the same result: the system is partially wiped, with most of the data left on the device, and after reboots, the user is presented with a login to the Admin account, not OOBE.
 We&#x27;ve tried many variations of the API call and have even checked the API calls from the Intune portal using dev tools, but all our efforts have produced the same, unsatisfactory result. Our problem seems to apply only to Windows 10 devices. A few tested Windows 11 devices were wiped successfully.
 calls used: https://graph.microsoft.com/beta/deviceManagement/managedDevices/XXXXXX/cleanWindowsDevice or /Wipe with different payloads etc. Also non-beta calls fails.

                              <span>Hey,
 SME here. MS365. Only work-from-home. No vpn. No centralized hardware.
 I have an individual user that has continuously corrupted pst-files on his W11 device. Were others don&#x27;t have (or most exceptionally have) this issue.
 After extensive trial &amp; error, I&#x27;m starting to suspect intermittent internetconnection.Speedtest is pretty fast, ping is ok, but when in teams-meeting we have also experienced small hickups and even disconnects. So I&#x27;m thinking her wired connection is kind of bad quality, drops the connection, hence device goes over to wifi, and back, and back, and back. Resulting in Outlook to start flipping.
 Any particular application where I can the user have to run a log for a few days and see what&#x27;s happening on her machine?

                              <span>Hello, 
 I already made my first post with a question about MS Defender for Endpoint about a month ago, since I have to do a little Presentation about it. 
 I am facing a new problem, which I can&#x27;t solve on my own (at least it looks like that). But now to my problem: 
 I want to know each possible column which I can get on Vuln. like CVE-ID, Description and so on. I was able to open a trial account with my student email and it works fine for MS Defender for Endpoint and Intune, but I can&#x27;t get access with the same acc to PowerBi and to Azure. I used an other Account to get Azure (and tried to set up some test vm´s), but I am not able to onboard them into MS Defender for VM. 
 What do I need ? 
 I got a report example about some Vuln. which I can&#x27;t reproduce with just using MS Endpoint and MS for Cloud and I would need a report with a few different (test) vulnerabilities, that are active, closed or in remediation with ALL possible columns. I tried every report feature in the application itself and I would like to know if there are more columns possible if I for example use the PowerBi Interface ? Its really hard, since the Documentation is not really precise in a lot of things like states etc.
 Sorry for my not very accurate English ... and also, if I did not understand sth. right - I am new in this field and not very experienced. 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hey guys, just looking into an issue a client noticed on their RD environment and I cannot figure out what&#x27;s happened.
 Basically 1 user has taken up 3 of the RD licenses (CAL&#x27;s) If you open RD licensing manager you can see the licenses active on an individual user bases, but then 1 user has 3 assigned to himself. The only thing that stands out as odd to me is it shows slightly different uppercase/lowercase characters for each of the entry&#x27;s. for example:
 CompanyDomain\joe.blogs - Issued on 18th may 2023 - Active
 CompanyDomain\Joe.Blogs - Issued on 15 may 2023 - Active
 CompanyDomain\Joe.blogs - Issued on 03 may 2023 - Active
 Notice each entry has different capital letters. this is a replica of how it shows in RD Licensing manager 
 1st entry has no capitals
 2nd entry has capitals on both names
 3rd entry has 1 capital on the first name and all lowercase second name. 
 They have 20 licenses in total, all active but 3 are assigned to this 1 guy
 user is only logged into 1 server at the moment of 3 RDS servers. RDBroker shows this is also the case.
 I can see in our RMM system they have more than 1 workstation. PC in office and laptop for remote working. Is it possible they&#x27;ve been given multiple licenses because they may have connected in from multiple workstations at some point? doesn&#x27;t explain why he&#x27;s got 3 when he only has 2 workstations if that were the case.

 Just wanted to hear from anyone with a similar experience. Was handed a laptop with my new role last October to which it&#x27;s a 7 year old lenovo with Windows home. November last year even after an SSD and ram upgrade to 8GB (from 4) still struggling with cpu. I&#x27;ve had to turn off noise filtering a little while ago in teams to make it usable during long meetings. I have an email trail since November asking for a new laptop screen and dock stating the reasons and its been stalled ever since, every meeting catchup with manager there&#x27;s a different excuse or blame on the further delayed merger talks. Latest is I&#x27;ve got a complaint on background noise in meetings which I argued I can&#x27;t switch on teams noise filtering due to ongoing cpu usage. Told to move my office at home or tell my family to be more quiet. I&#x27;m at my wits end and looking for a new role as my boss is a cow. Today&#x27;s advice from manager was to create a work profile on my personal laptop, as we all need to make personal sacrifices. Kind on makes me think I should go back to an MSP, respected in my last few. Maybe I should invoice them for use of my laptop?

                              <span>As a contractor I&#x27;ve worked with multi vendors over the last 12 years, but it&#x27;s always been one or two at a time. The last few years I&#x27;ve been working with sd-wan, firewalls, cloud, automation and traditional networking.
 It&#x27;s overwhelming to say the least, so many areas I need to have a good solid understanding of and find it hard to keep up with them all, not to mention the variety of vendors now.
 It&#x27;s really difficult to know what to focus on as it&#x27;s such a variety for network engineers these days.
 Does anyone else struggle with this? It&#x27;s great having the exposure but it&#x27;s all a bit too much also

                              <span>Imagine a situation where one is setting up a small network. There is to be some sort of physical server on the network with a VM running a webserver or mailserver or something that is exposed to the WAN. Obviously one should set up a firewall in this case. The physical server still has much memory and CPU time which is unused.
 As far is security is concerned, which one is better: using a dedicated physical firewall machine or adding a software-defined virtal firewall? Which is standard practice? In general, are security-oriented network services best kept physical for more guaranteed compartmentalization or best integrated into the SDN for simplicity (or something else)?

                              <span>Probably a stupid question but has anyone got experience importing hosts into the address space on an SRX with a CSV? I downloaded the example, updated it with my names, the host type and IPV4 IP addresses.
 Imported with no errors. When I search for the name or IP using the search tool, it returns no entries. If I try to then manually add the name or IP, it errors telling me it exists already. If I try to add the name to an existing group object - it is not available to select. 
 I delete the entry and can manually add the Name and IP and everything works fine. CSV import would be great for 50 and 60 new names and IP&#x27;s rather than the manual GUI host by host.

 Anything else I should pay special attention if I want to build a basic configuration for a new site?

                              <span>Technology stack for quick reference, it is an industrial network environment:
 Serial Network (20 Modbus slaves daisy-chained on RS-485) &gt; Modbus RTU to TCP Converter (Port 502, static IP assignment) &gt; Unmanaged OT Network Switch, /23 subnet with about 200 devices total, mostly Gigabit uplinks.
 After several years of happy and uninterrupted operation (it is a Datacenter), the Serial devices being Mastered by the converter had lost communications all at the same time. Initially, a soft reset of the device had re-established serial as well as TCP communications.
 Within hours, all of the serial devices lost communications again. Several different configuration changes were tried to no affect. A TCP/RTU testing utility was unsuccessful in establishing communications to the slaves via the Converter (failed on handshake), but the Web UI for the converters was still accessible. Soft reset did not help this time.
 Ended up changing the statically assigned IP configured on the Converter to a different address, same port (502), on the same subnet. Comms started working, everything stabilized.
 It is still working but I don&#x27;t understand why.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am working with a customer and am having an issue where devices are requiring a reboot in order to register back online intermittently. The devices are PoE + and require 30Watts to each one but that does not appear to be the problem as the customer sent back information that leads me to believe that cant be the issues (switches are definitely not overloaded). Below is the switch info along with the commands they are pushing to each port for the device before we install them.
 Cisco enterprise 3850 switches
 description **PA System**
 switchport access vlan 5
 switchport mode access
 no logging event link-status
 no snmp trap link-status
 spanning-tree portfast
 spanning-tree bpduguard enable
 I am by no means a network guy but could a standard QoS setting be causing a problem here? These are PA notification devices so they need to be set up to take priority over any other devices on the network incase of emergency. Could there be some kind of shut down due to inactivity possibly? Any help would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>So there are two buildings. Instead of paying for internet for both buildings we use a wireless bridge from one building to the other. I need to access a HA server I have setup down there. So the way it is all set up is:
 ISP &gt; Eero Mesh Network &gt; Wireless Bridge
  
Another Eero Mesh Network &gt; HA server.
  
Do you have any suggestions on how to access the the HA server from the first Eero network? The wireless bridge doesn&#x27;t seem to share the LAN or have any port forwarding options in the web interface.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve a 4 mikrotik CRS317-1G-16S+ setup, configured as two pairs of switches.
 Each pair has MLAG configured between them and hardware nodes are connected to one port in each via LACP. This is replicated with the second pair in another rack and then the two pairs have a 4 line LACP bond to connect them. All of this is a standalone isolated network.
 My hope for this was a complete redundancy with zero downtime, as our use case is really sensitive to that and any network downtime can cause major headaches.
 Overall this solution seems to work reasonably well and survives reboot of up to 2 devices (one of each pair) at the same time. There however often are small network down times of 1-4 seconds when one device goes down or reconnects after getting back up.
 Is this normal? I&#x27;ve not been able to experience these technologies on one of the more expensive brand devices, so I can&#x27;t compare, but I&#x27;d generally assume bonds are meant to mitigate perceivable network down times.

 Anyone use a ups vendor that&#x27;s reliable at all? We&#x27;d pretty much just want to be hands off when it comes to battery backup units. Vendor comes into the closets to replace the batteries or full units when needed or reach end of life.

 What would be the bet enterprise grade Dual WAN Routers that are easy to administer and don&#x27;t have all the fancy functions? We have very basic network and security needs, and really don&#x27;t store any data onsite. Everything is in Vendor Cloud&#x27;s.

                              <span>I&#x27;m interested in learning more about service provider network architecture and design, specifically when building out networks for b2b, though residential sounds interesting as well. When looking around for reading materials I&#x27;ve found &quot;Cisco ISP Essentials&quot; Barry Raveendran Greene and Philip Smith, but this was written over 20 years ago. Is there anything more recent that you might recommend? I get the feeling the only other material out there stuff for the Cisco NP/IE SP track? (Which I&#x27;m also looking into, but I&#x27;m just curious if there was other resources in addition to that)

                              <span>I came across demosim.comptia.io yesterday and found it quite interesting. I wondered if there are any similar network simulation quizzes out there for learning purposes? Preferable free, but i dont mind paying for it. The ones i found and where free to test are all like questionaires. But i would like to have this simulation style.

                              <span>Last week a department put in an incident saying an email was not delivered and because of that it cost the company a substantial amount of money and they are saying the email system messed up. The email SME did his research- it was Exchange- no external email. Someone internally email an attachment to a DL and none of those people in the DL claimed they received it, but mail flow and Exchange Reporter said they did. We were able to show who sent the message and when it was received by all the people in the DL which are internal as well.
 Fast forward to today and that department is sticking to it’s guns that the company email system messed up and the email just “disappeared”
 Really?! FFS are users this dumb? Not one but FOUR in the DL? What more do you want I thought? I was told by my leadership to find hard proof the message was there. So I did.
 I gave my adm account access to the mailboxes and logged into each one and found the message. The person causing the most stink- I found the message in their recover deleted items and it had been deleted four minutes after it was received.
 Now the department is blaming us because the file doesn’t have the right content- sorry that is not even remotely the IT department’s responsibility- please find another way to spin it how you f**ked up and don’t blame IT!

                              <span>One of the clients we work with is going out of business, they are shutting down the tenant and getting rid off the domain; they are closing for good. All users have M365 E3 license and all computers are correctly enrolled in Intune via AutoPilot and AzureAD Joined. The owner of the company would like to donate all company owned laptops, so I need to remove them from AutoPilot and Intune. 
 How can I remove around 100 Windows 10 devices from the Microsoft 365 tenant? Keep in mind that all computers have BitLocker enabled via Intune Policy so I need an option that will not trigger BitLocker.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>TLDR: is there a setting for RDP that would cause a session reset if a file or type of file is copied through the session?
 Like to read see below: For some specific reason we use this, I am new~ish to the team so don’t roast me just yet, but I have been getting complaints from day 3 that this process fails. When asked if it ever worked I get a “yea?”. It’s happening across multiple different systems across multiple networks. The only constant is windows 10 is the OS connecting to the servers rdp session. All the windows 10 are a base image to a bunch of vdi pools, the servers are scattered across networks and these vdi are used to manage it all. The user can have admin access to one or both side and get this. It seems to be 99% of users, like 1 person can get it to work and it’s pissing his peers off. 
 Work flow User pc&gt;vdi&gt;rdp 
 Any direction would be appreciated I thought I knew terminal server until now!

                              <span>We got our first ever IT intern. We are looking for some things to help him learn, outside of shadowing and doing some easier tasks. He&#x27;s very green, still in college. He has some programming and database experience from school. We have decided it probably wouldn&#x27;t make much sense to throw him on helpdesk as it would take just as long as the internship lasts to get him up to speed. Not saying he won&#x27;t do troubleshooting, just not the entire time. 
 If you were an intern, what are some things you wished you had picked up in the sysadmin field that maybe you didn&#x27;t during your internship. 
 Appreciate the feedback!

                              <span>In a pickle here. Hyper-v cluster with 5 nodes. Any VM that shuts down does not start again, stays on starting - 10% for a while until it gives the error: https://imgur.com/a/dapATHp
 If I try to start it with powershell I get an error related to permissions:
 PS C:\Windows\system32&gt; start-vm PTIDPAPRDAP1 start-vm : &#x27;PTIDPAPRDAP1&#x27; failed to start. (Virtual machine ID 432BF7B2-3951-4682-9B67-1D82B46BAB2A) At line:1 char:1 + start-vm PTIDPAPRDAP1 + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ + CategoryInfo : PermissionDenied: (:) [Start-VM], VirtualizationException + FullyQualifiedErrorId : AccessDenied,Microsoft.HyperV.PowerShell.Commands.StartVM 
 Happens to any vm at any host. Any idea on what might be happening?
 Edit: will try to reinstall one host and bring the vm&#x27;s up there.

                              <span>We have LAPS setup and configured, but we’re having a disagreement internally about how to best retrieve the password. If we’re trying to avoid using privileged domain creds on a desktop, what’s the most secure way for a tech to retrieve the password? Whether we launch ADUC or use a Powershell script from the tech’s local desktop, we still need to auth to the domain.
 LAPS solves the local credential cache issue, but if the machine is compromised in some way (keylogger etc) then elevating to the domain to retrieve the password still potentially exposes these accounts.
 How are you all dealing with this? Not allowing techs to elevate from their local machines and using an isolated bastion host instead?

                              <span>At my org the usual way of a ticket is as followed: 1. User calls the servicedesk, who in the best case solves the issue right away. 2. If servicedesk can&#x27;t solve it, the ticket is assigned to the responsible department (Applications, End-devices &amp; support, Infrastructure) 3. If support can&#x27;t solve it, the ticket is assigned to either applications or infrastructure. 
 This morning I pulled a queued ticket that support wasn&#x27;t able to solve. My colleague in the support department mentioned that he performed several checks on the users client. When I phoned the user, I casually chatted about the actions my colleague supposedly took. The user didn&#x27;t know what I was talking about. He said that noone from IT contacted her this day so I was a little curious.
 After the call I mailed my colleague …</span>

 Part-time Employee
 Remote Employee
 Chief Information Security Officer
 Network Admin
 System Admin
 Full-time Employee
 Temporary Employee
 Manager/Team Lead
 I said only the network admin and system admin should receive privileged accounts and I got it wrong because the CISO should have also received privileged roles. I&#x27;ve worked at a number of companies and not once has a Chief anything Officer received any sort of admin permissions; they only dictate policy, budgets, etc.
 What are your opinions on this? Do the executives at your companies perform admin duties?

 We have Call centers that need reporting.
 We need to record every single call, all the time, and keep them for seven years. (regulatory requirement).

                              <span>Hello,
 Windows server 2016 running under VMWare esxi6.7U3.
 I am using VMFS6
 I want to add approximately 50-60TB single disk size to this server.
 My questions are :
 1- I’m wondering what is your strategies/tricks about backuping a large vm (many TB+)? Anybody have any experience backing up a virtual machine of that size.
 2- I will use NTFS File system. What do you recommended as Cluster Size ?
 3- If I use a large size disk, what are the disadvantages?
 thanks,

                              <span>In our shop I have been ordering the cheapest GPU for our Dell OptiPlex orders. I have been under the impression this would help the computer to offload some of work of running two monitors. These are just desktops for staff and students. 
 At this point, are the two included/onboard DisplayPort ports enough to run two monitors and I can stop ordering desktops with the GPU and save the money?

                              <span>Hi, we have enabled Azure Rights Management a few weeks ago, but from higher up they would like to get rid of the labels Confidential \ All Company and Highly Confidential \ Al Company. I found where I can access these labels, but they are greyed out under Azure Information Protection. What we also noticed is that in the Outlook Preview the two labels don&#x27;t exist. However this will take a good few months before this version will even be rolled out. Can anyone provide me with some support on how to get rid of the two labels in question? Thanks in advance

 I have tried disable/ enable syncing in the settings as recommended everywhere. Also tried removing the profile and re adding but nothing works. When I resync in the settings, it does say setting up sync then goes back to the can&#x27;t sync error.
 Anyone come across this before?? I ha e about another 20 users all running ok with same setup.

                              <span>I just enrolled my personal device to test Android device management in Intune. I added some apps from the Managed Google Play Store. I made some required, and some available. The required ones were installed, but when I open the Google Play Store for Work nothing shows in the list of available apps.
 The apps were all made available to &quot;All Users.&quot; Some I made available for enrolled devices, some I made available with or without enrollment, just to see if that made a difference. Still, nothing is showing as available.
 Also, what&#x27;s the difference between &quot;Available for enrolled devices&quot; and &quot;Available with or without enrollment?&quot; How would someone access the available apps if their device isn&#x27;t enrolled?

                              <span>Hello to Everyone. 
 I would like to ask for your help. We have some folder shares in our company that after years the folder path overlaps the 260 characters. Our enviroment is windows-server based. 
 Is there any way to prevent this issue? 
 Thanks.

                              <span>Interesting issue. I have a .scr script that is in the same location. (Sits on a NAS). Two RHEL computers try to run this script. Same location same attributes because it is the SAME file in the same shared location.
 One computer executes it fine. The other says &quot;unable to execute&quot; (even as root)
 I have check the fstab file and the mount is the same. Both do not have firewall enabled. What is blocking one computer from executing scripts? Is there a place to check if the overall file system has a noexec? Because looking at both computers theirs are similar.
 Thoughts

                              <span>I have some interviews for some companies that I applied to a few weeks ago. I got laid off last week.
 Should you disclose this? I did hear how unemployed people struggle to get jobs. I have not updated my resume or LinkedIn with this yet.
 Would they find out during a background check?
 If they ask when you can start, what should you say?

 They have same settings on the switch, same VLANS, 
 Old server has only one NIC and new HP has 2 NICs in TEAM - tried separated as well.
 ​
 Do you have any ideas where to start to look?
 tried:
 - Cables
 - doblechecked Switch config
 - Windows logs
 - Performance - load is low - 90%+ resources free

                              <span>Greetings all!
 We have a b2b direct connect setup with another tenant (both sides), and until recently it worked fine, we could create shared channels and upload files there and sync those files to devices using the sync option.
 But since a few days ago (maybe even before, not a lot of people use this option and edit the files online) users from the other tenant (and ours on their shared channels) started having issues with syncing files from a shared teams channel to their pc.
 They can access and work on the files in the browser or through teams, but can&#x27;t sync the files to their pc, they either get an error that says: &quot;sorry onedrive can&#x27;t add your folder right now, you might not have permissions to this folder, or it may belong to another organization&quot;, or when they click sync (either from teams or from the sharepoint site it self, it doesn&#x27;t matter) it starts the onedrive app, flashes a blank window and closes the window, and nothing happens.
 What is the issue here? we didn&#x27;t change anything on the tenant or shared channel setup, it just stopped working. We tried it from both sides and its the same issue. Did the direct connect mess up somehow? is it a onedrive app issue? We tried all the usual stuff like reinstalling the onedrive app to the latest version, cleaning the cache, even new installs of windows, we tried different users and new/old groups/channels. I&#x27;ve opened a support ticket with microsoft, but thought someone here maybe had the same issue and managed to sort it?
 Any advice would be extremely helpful!
 (also sorry if i opened this topic in the wrong reddit site, feel free to point me in the right direction :D)

                              <span>Hello,
 For some reason, registry settings I configure on a Windows 10 PC are repeatedly restored by default. To be specific, the parameters we configure are AutoAdminLogon and the credentials for the user. The goal is to have a local account automatically login upon reboot of the computer. However, these settings keeps getting cleared by themselves. I&#x27;ve been looking at GPOs but can not find anything there. 
 Can someone provide some advice for troubleshooting?

 Have you ever achieved installing quick assist on Windows Server 2019? We’ve managed to install it yet it won’t launch..

 The goal: Print black labels with white text using my Zebra GX430t.
 The problem: I can&#x27;t seem to find a way to do this using Zebra Designer 3 free version. The solution using Zebra Designer 2 is not very good.
 The details:
 I have a Zebra GX430t with 76x127mm direct thermal labels. I am able to print perfectly well using the Zebra Designer 3 software by adding black text, objects etc. These print absolutely fine. What I want to do is to print exactly the same kinds of labels but with white text on black background rather than black text on white background. The labels will be used for presentation purposes on a black product so they need to match grap…</span>

                              <span>Hi there,
 We&#x27;ve been using Gravityzone endpoint for the past month now. A common alert we see on reports are PST trojan alerts. The trouble is it occasionally deletes the users entire PST file, and of course most don&#x27;t know how to check their quarantine despite being shown how to many times...
 Is it worth turning off scanning of email archives? I only use webmail myself, and most of the spam filtering should be done by Google first before arriving in Outlook, so I doubt this is a feature our users will need.

                              <span>Hey all,
 If you&#x27;re managing a large number of Azure-joined devices, you&#x27;re probably well aware that manually enrolling each one into Intune can be quite time-consuming. To streamline this process, I&#x27;ve put together a PowerShell script that automates it.
 Here&#x27;s an overview of the script&#x27;s functions:
 Creates an MDM Key: The script generates an MDM key if it doesn&#x27;t already exist.
 Enables Automatic MDM Enrollment: It sets up automatic MDM enrollment using Azure AD credentials.
 Generates Necessary Registry Keys: These keys are essential for the enrollment process.
 Initiates Group Policy Update: It forces a group policy update using the gpupdate /force command.
 Defines Enrollment URLs: The script assigns the required MDM enrollment URLs.
 Automates Device Enrollment: It calls upon deviceenroller.exe to automatically enroll the device in MDM.
 You can find the full script here: https://github.com/fKryptek/Intune/blob/main/EnrollToIntune.ps1
 As with any script you find online, I highly recommend reviewing it, tailoring it to your needs, and testing it within a controlled environment before deploying it on a larger scale.
 I&#x27;m interested in hearing about your experiences with the script, as well as any modifications or improvements you might suggest. If you encounter any problems or have questions, please let me know.
 Looking forward to your feedback.
 If you&#x27;d like to buy me a coffee for my efforts : https://www.buymeacoffee.com/bobbyhalford
 P.S.: Keep in mind, the effectiveness of this script may vary based on your Azure AD and Intune setup. Always customize and test in your own environment.

 The issue we have is SELF does not have rights to read or “write to personal information “ Which stops the correct enrolment of MDE as it needs to write a certificate to the personal store on the server. 
 Anyone else have this issue or would mind checking perms on their computer account object see if the default view has more than “change password” and “special”
 I want to change the perms but don’t want to bork the server. 
 My lab server has has normal permissions to SELF such as “Create All Child Objects” “Delete all child objects” “validate write to DNS host name” “read personal information “ “write personal information” “special”
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.
 Thanks.

 I used Dmarcian ( https://dmarcian.com/domain-checker/ ) and a few other checkers and it said my domain is valid. I believe Dmarcian is correct and Google Admin Toolbox is wrong. Check for yourself with any random domain. Anyone know what is wrong with Google Admin Toolbox?

                              <span>Hey all,
 Picked up a new envornment in the last 6 months and trying to understand why we have a fair amount of CPU resource avaiable, but still high CPU ready times in our Preprod resource pool. I THINK it&#x27;s due to how our resource pools are configured but not 100% sure.
 We have 2 resource pools: Prod and Preprod.
 Screenshots on how they&#x27;re setup: https://imgur.com/a/k62Po8S
 What I THINK is going on: 
 Although we have &quot;enough&quot; CPU resources within the cluster, because preprod is set to low, it&#x27;ll never be able to contend with prod.
 However, if I set Prod to High, and Preprod to Normal.. I&#x27;ll still have a 1:2 ratio of 4000 to 8000..
 So I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;ll solve my problem?
 I&#x27;m also not sure if I should set a CPU reservation / limit closer to what the actual usage is?

                              <span>So I work for multiple schools and use Autotask so staff and students can log tickets. I have been encouraging everyone to log tickets but I usually end up with titles like 
 “Laptop not working”
 “A teacher needs access to a share”
 It’s great that they are logging a ticket but how can I help them be more descriptive and perhaps mention the troubleshooting they have already tried? What are you guys doing that makes logging tickets less of a hassle for your end users?

 Can anyone please guide me if they have any references to an open source repo or codebase which has implemeted this stuff?

                              <span>Hey guys, got a quick question here. I added a Weblink as an App in Intune and on a Surface I can see it in the Portal App and install it through there. But for the mobile devices (Android and iOS) the link just doesn&#x27;t show up. I selected &quot;yes&quot; for show this as a featured app in the company portal, but on the phones it doesn&#x27;t appear. Any ideas why? I assigned it to our MDM group as available for enrolled devices. What the hell am I missing? Thanks in advance and if you need more information, just ask.

 Not sure if it is the cause, but I am getting error 2004 and warning 2212 from the event viewer. 
 The replication no longer resume. I tired all the methods I can find online but none of them works.
 Hope someone can shed a light.

 With all of the SaaS systems, other integrations, links and what not it is hard to keep track on what is connected to what.
 Is there anyone who knows a good software or service to keep records of the made connections?
 I would like to have some sort of dashboard/view that can show me what is connected to lets say azure or even to the local AD, it doesn&#x27;t have to generate it automatically, i can add it any time i implement a connection, link or service.

 In a brand new infrastructure and having all resources you want, would you go for ADD exclusively or would you mix it up with on prem? And why?

 Because I try to run Windows command:
 Dism /Online /Enable-Feature /FeatureName:Microsoft-Hyper-V-Hypervisor 
 It&#x27;s showing the error message about it&#x27;s required dependency features from Microsoft-Hyper-V
 If I run Windows command:
 Dism /Online /Enable-Feature /All /FeatureName:Microsoft-Hyper-V 
 It installed all Hyper-V Hypervisor features successfully.
 However, I want to install Hyper-V Hypervisor feature only and if I enabled via GUI it also installed Hyper-V Hypervisor successfully.

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been using Lansweeper for 5 years now, apart from the Helpdesk lacking many features and possibilitys and the mail notifications being a bit unreliable, it did it&#x27;s job for a relatively low price. Asset Management was also not the greatest, but it was on Premise and again, did it&#x27;s job &quot;good enough&quot;. Deployments were always a bit messy. 
 With the recent changes Lansweeper made to their licensing structure, we are definately not going to pay premium for a Cloud Solution that doesn&#x27;t do much better in the other reagards. 
 So basically: Are there any alternatives? 
 Price doesn&#x27;t play that much of a role anymore, things have changed considerably and the IT-Budget got a pretty heavy bump (although it&#x27;s still not absolutely massive and we are still only 4 people in the Team, so it has to be something that&#x27;s relatively easy to learn...)
 Main point is: It has to be On-Prem. ITAM with connected Helpdesk would be something very nice as well. All i have found was ManageEngine, but i&#x27;ve not found any user stories about it :D 
 Any help would be appriciented - thanks! :)

                              <span>Hey sorry if this is a dumb question, still learning and the previous posts on the topic seem a little outdated (8+ years old).
 I&#x27;m having trouble understanding the benefits of SFTP over something like transfer via HTTPS to an s3 bucket. With s3 we can have multipart file transfers up to 5TB over TLS 1.2/3, and manage auth with iam + sigv4.
 I&#x27;m wondering what benefits SFTP provides/why is it used today other than historical/legal reasons. Is SSH more secure than TLS 1.3? Is ssh based file transfer faster?
 Again, sorry if this is dumb,
 Thanks

By expanding I mean constructing a completely new production plant, of course including all new networking and IT equipment for ~70 users with room to grow.My boss and I already went there a week ago for 5 days, because they are just now starting with all networking related tasks as the construction of the building is nearly finished, e.g laying down cabling, installing wallports, constructing the server room etc.
 Now my boss wants to send me there again alone in one or two weeks, to check on the work being done and act as a kind of supervisor for them if any problems need clarification. I am the sole project manager for this now I guess.To be honest, I wasn´t very keen on g…</span>

                              <span>Say your organization is multi-cloud, or in a single cloud provider with considerations to go multi-cloud.
 What are your present day criteria to determine where you&#x27;ll place a new workload? For example:
  
Which cloud provider and which region? What are the metrics or drivers that will motivate you to consider more than one provider? Or a new region within the same provider?
 Is the proverbial &quot;we always want the cheapest&quot; criterion still dominant in your decision-making strategy?
 What will deter you from using a pre-existing region or a cloud provider, other than survivability and site reliability? Is it capacity or bandwidth, or could it be latency?
 Other than the age-old &quot;proximity to the edge&quot; or &quot;proximity to the end users&quot; that were dominant factors a few years ago, are there new emerging considerations that you&#x27;re applying lately when deciding where to put a new sizable footprint?
  
I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ll think about greenfield (brand new project, no restrictions) vs brownfield (where this new workload has to coexist and work together with legacy infrastructure). If your analysis is made simpler by considering a branny-new slate for a new project, how would you approach it?

 For example, here is the route

                              <span>Hello everybody. I would like to know if anyone has already configured this switch model via CLI. I don&#x27;t have much experience with this equipment and hiring a specialist is out of the question. When connecting a Dell R720 server directly to the switch, with 10G fiber ports, there is no network traffic.The scenario is as follows: Dell R720 (NIC: Intel(R) 10G 2P X520 Adapter) + Dell R640 (NIC 1: BRCM 10G/GbE 2+2P 57800 rNDC) connected to Dell S4128F. In the image you can see the active server connections on ports 13, 14, 15 and 16, on port 25 a DAC cable is connected to another Dell S4128F (redundancy) and on port 27 a 1Gbps cable is connected to interconnect with a Dell 6248 (legacy network). Basically I need these servers to have a 10G network working.Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi fellas
 I was searching info about network regionalization or in other words, how to split a multi vendor topology into defined domains per vendor. The FMO or final picture is SR-MPLS with flex-algo and TE.
 I need your opinions based on your experience or criteria about how do you will split and make those domains.My main concern its how do I made the peerings between domains. Should I use eBGP? BGP Confederation?? Bear in mind that the current topology has all PEs with an iBGP peering against a pair of route reflectors
 This is the current topology:
 Current
 This is what we are analizing:
 Future

 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hey All, 
 Long time lurker, first time posting. 
 I&#x27;ve got a bit of a situation that I thought I had a solution to, but am now stumped. Please excuse any ignorance or lack of detail. 
 The scenario is, we&#x27;ve got a location that just had a 3rd party install a Fortigate FW needed for remote access to their devices. Said firewall needs direct internet access. Normally this vendor would use an LTE device to accomplish this, but the location is out in the boonies and service sucks, so that option is out the window. 
 Our current ISP has a Ciena fiber hand off with two 1 gbe ports (will come back to why this is relevant), one of which is being used to connect to our firewall for Internet access. The demarc for this fiber circuit is in a separate building from where the 3rd party Fortigate fw is located. The two buildings are connected via mm fiber and use Brocade/Ruckus switches. 
 My initial thought was to run a link from the open port in the handoff, to our switch in an access port with a newly created vlan in building one, and trunk the vlan across the network to building two where the Fortigate is located (access port again) and assign the interface on the Fortigate one of the IP&#x27;s from our block. Well, that was the plan until I just got off the phone with our ISP, where the indicated that that open port is actually for an entirely new circuit that we would have to add to our account. So, I&#x27;m back to the drawing board. 
 As I eluded to early, we do have a block of IP&#x27;s (/29) that we can use so I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a solution, but I&#x27;m not sure how to achieve that. While I was only the phone with the ISP, they also indicated that in order to use that block, I&#x27;d have to have a L3 device to handle the routing of said block. I don&#x27;t think leadership will agree to purchasing any equipment for this as things have been extremely tight. 
 Apologies if this is all over the place, it&#x27;s been a hell of a day, and not just for the problem above. 
 Cheers

                              <span>Hi guys. My company will be having a new ISP line installed at a new site and I was shown what the IP details were by my colleague. I&#x27;m quite confused! This is my first time being involved in this sort of stuff so I&#x27;m trying to understand as much as I can.
 In our other offices we have ISP circuits where we have been given a /29 IP range and we just assign the IP of our firewalls from this range and point the default gateway to that of the ISP router so it is a lot simpler.
 Now it&#x27;s LAN IPs and WAN IPs and I&#x27;ve no idea how they relate to our current setup which is:
 Firewall (DHCP,NAT) &gt; L2 switch &gt; ISP router
 I know we need a router that will point all traffic to the ISP default gateway, that much is clear. There is a /29 range for the LAN side and a /30 for the WAN side.
 The way I see it is that we have to use 2 IPs from the /29 for the firewalls and another IP for the router interface facing the firewall. Then from the /30 range another router interface (pointing to the ISP router) will be configured with an IP and then a default route will point to the ISP&#x27;s default gateway.
 I think that our setup will then be:
 Firewall (DHCP,NAT) &gt; L2 switch (ISP failover) &gt; Router &gt; ISP router
 Am I on the right track with this or am I completely misunderstanding?

                              <span>Auditor says machine tunnels are insecure because it grants access to the network without a rotating one time key for MFA. So, someone could break into the device, extract the machine certificate, then install it on another device and use it for unauthorized access.
 What mitigations exists to prevent this?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been struggling to bring up Private Peering on an ExpressRoute circuit delivered via Zayo. I&#x27;ve dug around for examples configuring this on a Nexus 9K and I&#x27;ve pieced a few things together, but I haven&#x27;t been able to get a BGP session up. I appreciate any insight you might share.
 On my side I have 1G service delivered from Zayo into an eth port on a Nexus C93180YC-FX running NXOS 9.3(10). Zayo indicated that I should use QinQ and they&#x27;re delivering the primary on VLAN A, secondary on VLAN B.
 My QinQ-fu isn&#x27;t strong but at a high level my understanding is that I should be receiving S-tags A and B and using C-tag C, which is what I&#x27;ve configured for VLAN ID in Azure. Do I have that backwards? Microsoft&#x27;s routing examples, though for IOS-XE, seem to indicate the reverse.
 I am consulting this article for configuring QinQ on the 9K.
 My issue is that all of the documentation I&#x27;m reading is around multiple inner tags with one outer tag. I believe I need the reverse. I&#x27;ve tried both the Configuring VLAN Mapping for Selective Q-in-Q on a 802.1Q Tunnel Port and Configuring Selective Q-in-Q with Multiple provider VLANs examples. I enter the first VLAN mapping switchport vlan mapping vlan-id-range dot1q-tunnel outer vlan-id and when I try to enter a second mapping with the same inner VLAN ID I receive an error about a conflicting mapping for the inner VLAN already existing on this port.
 Other info:
 I tried a configuration with just the primary to see if I could get BGP peering but nothing is coming up.

                              <span>Hello experts
 I&#x27;m looking to do a breakout from a 400Gbps connection to multiple 25Gbps connections. Is this possible? If not, what are my other options?
 It seems that 400Gbps supports breakout only to 4x100Gbps ( https://community.fs.com/news/400g-qsfp-dd-solution-for-400g-data-center-interconnect.html ) . Is that right ? or I can somehow split 100Gbps further ?

                              <span>I work for a mid-size engineering firm, ~1000 employees. IT recently announced they&#x27;d upgraded the core system from 1 to 2.5Gbps. Unfortunately, it would only be rolled out to individual users based on documented need or general age upgrades (i.e., all new computers will have a 2.5G NICS, but they won&#x27;t upgrade current computers). I am not due for an upgrade for a few years, and I won&#x27;t be able to justify a &quot;need&quot; for the faster connection. But I want it.
 Current setup: Wall -&gt; VOIP phone (RJ45, 1G) VOIP phone -&gt; hub monitor (RJ45, 1G) Hub monitor -&gt; Laptop (USB-C) Hub monitor -&gt; 2nd monitor (DP pass)
 Laptop also has a 1G RJ45, and a second identical USB-C port.
 I think I need a new hub, but I can&#x27;t find a product. Does this product exist: * RJ45 in (2.5Gbps or higher) * RJ45 out (for phone) * USB-C to computer (network and monitor) * USB-C to monitor (displayport passthrough)
 Power supply from the hub isn&#x27;t needed. I may be willing to omit the RJ45 out to the phone and just forward it to my cell.

 Also, in this context, also curious if anyone has spoken with Cogent about their new wavlenegth product based on Sprint&#x27;s network. Does it solve anything for them?

                              <span>Hello, curious if anybody has an idea what could be causing the following error that I am seeing in the logs of our 9000 series Cisco switches:
 ​
 Examples (from different Switches):
 &quot;%FED_PM-3-RESRC_ERROR: Switch 1 R0/0: fed: Port Manager error -port secure inactivity time: resource access failed.&quot;
 &quot;%FED_PM-3-RESRC_ERROR: Switch 5 R0/0: fed: Port Manager error -port secure inactivity time: resource access failed.&quot;
 &quot;%FED_PM-3-RESRC_ERROR: Switch 1 F0/0: fed: Port Manager error -port secure inactivity time: resource access failed.&quot;
 ​
 This log pops up after a reboot in about 50% of the 300 or so C9000 Switches that I have polled so far. All Switches are running 17.03.05. A few have been upgraded to 17.06.05 for testing but the log error is apparent in both versions. So far, I have polled C9200-24T, C9200-24P, C9200-48P, C9200-48T and C9300-48Ps. All models show the log. Some are standalone switches, some are stacks with up to 8 switches.
 ​
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

 connected to my switch https://www.tp-link.com/ca/business-networking/poe-switch/tl-sg1005p/
 which is then connected to my router. 
 ​
 Since I got this switch connected to my router I have been having issues accessing my router page and sometimes the devices don&#x27;t show up on my router. When they do show up the camera is not listed. I can still see my devices on blue iris which doesn&#x27;t see my camera.

 My cables are all CAT6 what am I doing wrong?

                              <span>Recently my organization had a minor debate about bandwidth; our ISP supplies a 1GB Fiber connection to our site. We have multiple VLANs and a fallback ISP with crossover, etc. The debate was about having several 50&quot; T.V.s streaming something constantly if this would cause a dramatic decline in LAN service. Let&#x27;s put a number of five (5) TVs.
 Some of our personnel are worried about internet-specific bandwidth. I recommended that we downgrade the stream quality to preserve bandwidth but limit each TV to 5Mbs max. Obviously, that is going to be 20Mpbs out of 1000Mbp. At max out usage is about 80Mbps at peak times. Meaning there is quite a bit of headway.
 My argument was LAN Bandwidth; we have servers/services/non-internet devices that are networked together. Let&#x27;s say we take a generic 100…</span>

                              <span>Hey,
 So I would greatly appreciate some feedback on my chances of applying for Network Engineer role (again).
 My situation is kind of different from the ‘normal’ network engineer career path. 
 I had started as a junior network engineer as my first IT job(i got quite lucky) then after 3years of experience i got my CCNA certification. But due to a position limit for network engineer at our company my manager had asked me to change to Helpdesk engineer since we were lacking in that area. So now i have just over a year of experience in helpdesk as of now.
 Currently i am working towards my CCNP but i would like to ask what are my chances of getting a job back in as a network engineer? Since normally people go from helpdesk to network engineer. Will this be effect my chances of going back to network engineer?
 Any feedback on my chances and what i can do to improve my chances will be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>How much does it cost to run a CGNAT setup for 1,000 subscribers? Can you do this without licensing somehow? Is there some way of just running this on a server?
 Appreciate any advice - thank you!

                              <span>I’ve been in the Marine Corps Reserve as a Sys admin for 8 years now. During the majority of this time I’ve been operating heavy equipment for my civilian job, its pretty good money between 80k-100k a year depending on how much over time I chose to work. During this time I’ve accumulated bills like a house, wife, car, ect… in my military career I’ve gone over seas 3 times totaling about 2 years and some change of time spent in country working as a sys admin. This last deployment I really decided I wanted to pursue IT as a career. While deployed I got my Sec+ and started looking for jobs back home in the Chicago area. I’m struggling to find a job that pays enough to support my wife and current living expenses. I am willing to take a small pay cut to get started in the industry. I guess my question is does anyone have any guidance on how to proceed or what I should do. 
 Note: I absolutely hate my current job. 
 And I still have an active security clearance if that helps

I&#x27;m not doing well mentally, I&#x27;m just feeling overwhelmed and nervous about this. I&#x27;m not like this when I have a job and I&#x27;m interviewing, not sure if there are any recommendations on something I can do to cool my nerves before hand or not; aside from drinking that is.

 I went to university 10 years ago for Mechanical engineering and I dropped out 2 years later to pursue a career in Aviation. 
 I worked 2-3 odd jobs at once for several years and paid my Pilot school and became a Commercial Aircraft Pilot. Once I got my license, I started my instructor training to become a flight instructor and that’s when COVID happened. Aviation took a shit and every captain I knew were suddenly jobless and seeing how versatile the industry was I decided to switch into tech because I’ve always been a very tech savvy guy since I was a kid.

                              <span>So I had a company reach out to me after viewing my resume and gave me the song and dance stating they felt I would be an amazing fit, my experience is exactly what they need, blah blah blah.
 The job was for a systems engineering/architect position 
 In the email they told me to select three days that would be good to interview and a bit more about what I do.
 I responded and sent the days they were asking for a went into more detail about my job, related tasks, but kept it quite brief so to save the rest for the interview.
 Well the first day I put on there was for yesterday and I heard nothing, so I sent a follow up email asking if the interview was still occurring and the day ends with me still hearing nothing.
 So I looked up the company the following day again to make sure it is a legitimate company, which it is, just to make sure I wasn’t getting messed with.
 Why ask to interview me just to ghost me and not have the decency to at least tell me something.
 The job market is tough enough as is for most people, companies that do this do not make things any better.
 Is this common?

 Really seems like it&#x27;s been going WAY downhill with barracuda the last couple weeks. Also was notified today &quot;oops we might have blocked everything today, so uh, go through that mess manually&quot;
 If you are coming up on a renewal, I&#x27;d strongly look at alternatives. Mimecast and proofpoint look viable but I haven&#x27;t started digging way in yet.

                              <span>What was the best excuse you have come up with for not going into work? For me, it was &quot;I quit 2 weeks ago. I am NEVER coming in again.&quot;
 Anyhow, in another group this was asked and I had to laugh when someone wrote this as the reason that they were not coming into work:
 &quot;Sorry boss these past couple days have been quite explosive. I&#x27;ll spare you the details but it&#x27;s a complete disaster. Like lava coming out of places you don&#x27;t want it to come out of. It has unfortunately affected my ability to work the past 48 hours but seems to be improving. I&#x27;ll keep you posted. Thank you&quot;

 Yeah, they have a very good excuse, don&#x27;t you agree?

 Oh yeah and Windows Store apps will now finally incorporate the feature Windows Phone had and have native backup/restore functionality, so that switching PC&#x27;s requires less preference reconfiguration.

                              <span>Hello all,My company is on the way to complete the ISO/IEC 27001 certification process. One open and hotly discussed point is the logging issue.I am a big friend of &quot;GrayLog&quot; which we have been using for a long time in the free version. However, our IT security officer says that a protection against manipulation of the log events cannot be guaranteed. The product variant &quot;GRAYLOG SECURITY&quot; would fulfill this requirement, but due to the licensing of the complete Elasticsearch stack with the machine learning features and the &quot;top-notch-enterprise&quot; requirements on the base system (Oracle DB etc.) this is unfortunately too expensive for us.I found this method on the net to write a signature in each event and validate it again on readout (https://community.graylog.org/t/graylog-for-integrity-log-hashing/15570), however this is obviously not enough as a user with admin rights could easily manipulate these hashes.Has anyone ever done the GRAYLOG FREE task as ISO/IEC 27001 compliant logging and can give me some hints on how to implement this?

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Some people here may understand the situation we&#x27;re in.
 Basically, we have singular users working in remote parts of the UK (literally miles from the nearest mobile tower), where mobile dongles/sim hubs just do not work. The users have relatively low bandwidth usage, they mainly use SharePoint for Word and Excel collaboration, possibly some infrequent Teams calls. 
 We&#x27;ve had quotes in the past for installing leased lines (far too expensive and takes far too long for the cable to be laid; 3-6 months for a 12 month project) 
 Basically, we&#x27;ve tested StarLink (the standard residential edition) and it&#x27;s an absolute godsend. It&#x27;s relieved such a massive headache for the onsite user and from me from a sysadmin perspective. 
 We don&#x27;t need the business edition, it&#x27;s far too expensive (£2400 for the kit and £240 p/m) and we don&#x27;t need the bandwidth or speeds. It&#x27;s literally 1 person in a cabin working from 1 PC...
 Should we continue down this road or do you think we could encounter issues in the future using the residential service? I do feel it&#x27;s slightly amoral? 
 Thanks guys

                              <span>TOTP is something that can be self-hosted. Completely vendor-neutral.
 The TOTP &quot;server&quot; could be self-hosted, and users could be told to use Google Authenticator, Authy, etc. If banks didn&#x27;t want to do that, they could build a TOTP client in a day into their apps.
 Why is it that if a bank supports TOTP, it seems they can only do phone or email authentication? 
 AND, for apps on my phone that require passwords but log me out periodically (CHASE), it would be great to see in the app a warning for days left in session. I didn&#x27;t always keep a copy of my password database in my phone, and so I could be across the country and suddenly be locked out of my bank accounts.
 TLDR - Bank 2FA seems to blow, with no indication as to why, and their session management also sucks.
 If anyone has insight, let me know. I figure this is appropriate for /r/sysadmin because I have been in the field and wonder what is holding the security teams back from doing things correctly at these institutions.

                              <span>I see a lot of sentimentality in this sub around the idea that technicians and engineers who have strong skillsets and problem solving are good at their jobs.

 I wanted to broach the subject of what being Good at your Job in IT actually should look like, and why being very skilled doesn&#x27;t automatically make you good at your job.
 Our entire industry is a service industry. Even our engineers, are working in service to other departments in some fashion. Outside of maybe the deepest depths of DevOps, our sector is mostly customer (users are interchangeable with customers for internal departments) service oriented.

                              <span>I am in the process of figuring out how to best do a migration away from DUO Ldap for Cisco Anyconnect VPN to Duo SSO, has anyone done this and is it possible to keep the DUO LDAP solution running side by side until the Duo SSO for Cisco anyconnect is configured? or do i have to create a maintenance window and do a cutover migration?
 I have created a case at Duo support, but they haven&#x27;t responded back, so i figured id try my luck here, maybe someone already done the migration

                              <span>TL/DR: Foster kid’s charity collecting laptops to rebuild for foster kids, tax write off given for computer donations 
 Hi folks, 
 I replied to a post here a while ago about how I collect laptops and rebuild them for foster kids and families in Denver, Colorado, USA. I had a lot of private messages sent to me asking how to help but haven’t been able to post till now. 
 I have been in IT officially for about 6 years now and after I had one foster child who kept punching my laptop when he got mad at a game, I thought that maybe other foster families had this same issue and needed a repaired laptop or a laptop for the kids. I worked with my office building and started collecting any desktop/laptops that were in the basement Tom be recycled, made about 100 systems - then the pandemic hit and the demand went up. 
 I’ve been able to rebuild about 400+ laptops on my own (windows, Mac, a few Ubuntu set ups) and distribute them - but we’re running low and the need keeps growing. 
 If anyone wants to unload systems for tax credit through a registered 501c3, we can accept donations and send you a blank form for tax write offs, and even make a post thanking you on linked in for free marketing. The goal is that you and your company win, and the kids win. 
 Though I expose my identity a bit doing this, here is a LinkedIn link where you can search the history of this charity I run and who I partner with to know it’s legit.

 No pressure, but if you can help, there are lots of foster kids and families in our area who could use these!

                              <span>Ran into an issue I&#x27;ve not experienced in Autopilot today. When using the latest &quot;Get-WindowsAutoPilotInfo.ps1 -Online&quot;, I eventually got the &quot;806 - ZtdDeviceAlreadyAssigned&quot; error. No big deal, dummy me did a typo on the serial number. Well, I went through Intune Enrollment and also verified in MS4B that this device serial number does not exist. Looking in AAD, it also verifies the device is in Autopilot but I cannot find it to assign a new tag to the device. 
 Since the device hash is clearly registered but cannot find it from the serial number (and no the mobo hasn&#x27;t been replaced), how can I find the device to assign the necessary group tag?

                              <span>so we are migrating our dns from current provider (oracle\dyn) to Amazon Route 53 and I have questions.
 testing our first move, on one site we decreased the TTL on the oracle\dyn side, and set it low on Amazon side. so do we then go to our domain host and add the amazon dns servers, or do we instead remove dyndns and THEN add amazon once we see the TTL updated? IPs are not changing at all, just moving the DNS.

The course does not announce these cancellations, instead they make customers check back with their calendar on their website. My question is, would anyone know of a way to continuously scan this website&#x27;s calendar to look for open tee times?

 I setup a virtual DC on my PC 3 years ago with a domain, accounts etc and then went away and got on with my life. I&#x27;ve now come back to it and can&#x27;t remember any account details etc (yes I know I should have kept some kind of a record) any ideas on how to get back into my server

                              <span>I tried searching but I didn&#x27;t find the correct answer or didn&#x27;t use the quite terms. I am trying to tighten up our domain admin accounts.
 I am trying to implement so that separate admin accounts can promote themselves to Domain Admin when they need it temporarily. Is there is a way to do this?
 Or is the best way to create a master domain account locked down to only login into the DCs that perhaps the IT manager could promote the account or maybe do the domain admin task required.
 ​
 Thanks for any advice.

                              <span>Hi All, I am trying to fix the mess the previous admin created by enabling Bitlocker on machines manually via local gpo and not recording it anywhere. And guess what, the recovery keys are not in AD but in a spreadsheet (no, not password protected). 
 Does anyone have a script that would report on all machines in a domain that have Bitlocker enabled? I have been testing a few I found online but none of them works.
 Thank you in advance.

Itwould be nice if they are open source projects.

                              <span>Hello,
 I searched on Google without finding an answer to my problem.
 I have a traefik running on a docker compose that has an ip in 192.168.20.34 and I want to redirect the traffic from blabla.fr to a machine in 192.168.20.130. I can&#x27;t figure out how to set up the traefik so that it works. For my other apps that run under docker-compose and that are on the same machine everything works perfectly

Also the &quot;-Identity FSMO-DC&quot; is that the old master I presume? So it should be &quot;-Identity AD-1&quot;? Does it look like I&#x27;m missing anything from this?

                              <span>I recently took a new job at a place and I’m completely overwhelmed. Old IT guy set up local accounts on all the computers. They’re not joined to a domain and he has everyone’s passwords written down. There’s no ticketing system. No group policy. No system images. No software deployment tools. No standard computer that they’re ordering, just whatever seems good on Amazon. No naming convention for devices. He’s got users in AD for their email address but besides that, pretty much nothing.
 I’m trying to take a deep breath on this stuff as I know these changes take time, but I’m not used to an overhaul like this. My gauge in the company is that they aren’t going to want to spend money to make changes because it has “worked” for this long. Does anyone have any suggestions on how I should prioritize and approach this?

 https://northwave-cybersecurity.com/threat-intel-research/analysis-of-new-active-malware-mediaarena-pua
 We have several hundred machines in our environment that we confirmed have it installed and we are trying to find a way to remove it. I&#x27;ve drilled down into the registry and found the uninstall string but the one it lists basically just deletes the key.
 cmd.exe /c reg delete HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\PDFPower /f
 Has anyone found a better way to uninstall it via script? As I&#x27;m not confident that actually uninstalls the app and it just removes it from being listed in the registry and programs/features.
 If you&#x27;re dealing with this you&#x27;re aware is sets your default search engine to one their own (AASearchpoweronline). Is resetting edge settings enough to fix that?

 i am getting pretty frustrated with this, i have built a small lab env with a domain controller that is acting as a DNS server .
 i am trying t o manually add a DNS record in the forward lookup zone for a linux machine , which is not joined into the domain . 
 ​
 pretty straight forward i want the hostname to be resolved to that static IP however , adding a New Host always assumes that i want to add a FQDN for that machine . which in my case isn&#x27;t i just want to add machine called Linux1
 ​
 I tried and created a new FLZ named only Linux1 and then added a new entry and left the name blank so it inherited the domain name which is Linux1.
 But still no Luck , when i try to ping Linux1
 ​
 Ping request could not find host Linux1 .Please check the name and try again.
 ​
 Any help would be appreciated

                              <span>Hi all, I&#x27;ve got a technical interview coming up today for a junior sysadmin role. I&#x27;m a bit nervous, but it&#x27;s for a relatively small MSP with a relatively small team 
 What should I expect and are there any common mistakes I should avoid? Or just anything in general that might help me. They seem really excited to have me come in and the job offer is already on the table, I&#x27;m just scared that I&#x27;ll mess it up.
 Thank you :)

Yesterday we received an email about software problems in our Polish site, where the software used to control machine equipment in our factory &quot;crashed&quot; several times during the last week. I put crashed between &quot;&quot; because they listed various complaints under the word &#x27;crashed&#x27;, including computers freezing up and computers supposedly rebooting on their own. The communication is a bit hard since they do sometimes use Google Translate when English becomes too hard. 
 The software runs on a server and the desktop computers, all Windows 10, connect to the server using the installed WinCC application on them. The computers were recently updated to version 22H2 right around the time the issues started to occur more frequently, but after talking with the people onsite this problems has bee…</span>

 I am looking to automate our laptop/PC deployment a bit. Atm Im manually configuring our laptops (all Windows) which is rather something I know I could automate. 
 What&#x27;s ur recommendation of grasping this if we&#x27;re using G Suite with a GCPW? Is anyone in the same boat? Should we consider migrating to O365 for ease of things like this? Thanks.

 Effectively I want to simulate accepting a meeting invitation, so that it schedules the meeting in both my Teams and Outlook calendars (assuming I haven&#x27;t been emailed a meeting invitation and am unable to get the organiser to do so).
 Or is this not possible?

                              <span>i dont know what physics or engineering term would desribe a scenario whereby no matter what input you give a machine the output will always be the same or wont increase.
 I think have reached that point or about to reach that point where you no longer care about working extra hard, pleasing users and execs, going the extra mile, being innovative etc 
 Reason? it seems like my efforts are not recognised and rewarded 
 To be frank if i start working according to my job description now i will be seen as slacking because i have normalized working extra hard and going the extra mile since day one, taking calls on weekends, after hours, lucnh time etc, speedy resolution of issues (its now 3 and a half years now as helpdesk IT technician)
 To be fair as well i have not increased qualifications on paper but i have upskilled on the job and taken up extra tasks which were not initially on my job description -specifically im now somewhat of a lite system admin because i have been opened to some administration tasks and given rights to several systems 
 The companies, systems and users to support has grown a lot in the past 3 years and the parent company is on track to launch new companies who we will all support 
 Still the paycheck is the same as it was 3 years ago.

                              <span>Hola,
 I own an business on Fiverr, however, I have a big problem, the managers who reply to the clients (based in Phillipines) that are logged into my account can delete the whole account!
 I am trying to figure out the best way to make it so that they cannot access certain sensitive pages, such as ‘analytics’, ‘gigs’, ‘settings’, etc.
 I am tech savvy but I have absolutely no clue the best way to do this? I was thinking about a virtual desktop service where they log in to a user, and that computer has some great programming that blocks those URLS, but that may be a bit glitchy, i’m not sure.
 I need advice on the best way to do this? 
 Thank you,
 Harry

                              <span>In my previous place of work we have a few sets of Yealink conference solutions and the CPW90 works really well and versatile. Where I&#x27;m at now uses those Surface Hub look-alikes and their built in microphone sucks. Management refuse to implement an actual microphone solution and just blame the bad audio on f/w and this and that.
 I looked around and I have never seen anyone tried/done that, connecting a CPW90 to a PC. Does anyone here had any experience?
 I am thinking if a generic DECT receiver / base station will be compatible with it.
 Or, does anyone has recommendations for products with similar form factor (1 base station, 2 wireless microphones, similar price tag is a big plus)

 Out of about 400 applications we interviewed about 20. The 95% of applications that were left out simply had no mention of any particular skills that we needed. Some people mentioned knowing how office works while some knew how to install a pc.
 The 20 that we interviewed showed some promise in their application but when asked about their mentioned skills they went completely silent. We had people say they know how to install servers, manage vmware, m365, aws, ad, networks and general knowledge of IT. When interviewed though... absolutely no idea how to do any of those.

 Everything is in the title, I even tried to apply the new MS template instead of the legacy rule we had for that alert and still detects when internal users are added.
 https://i.postimg.cc/TY0KVt2p/image.png
 It detects that those users are in the External group, but they are not (I actually checked and there are no users with any of our domains). It started happening with no change on our part like 2-3 weeks ago.
 Any idea ?
 Thanks in advance !

 I&#x27;ve been doing desktop-come-everything support at my role (200ish global staff) for 3 and a half years so far, and am looking to get a decent payrise this time round. Did 5ish years helpdesk L1/L2 prior, am 30something years oldnow.
 My boss sent me an email this afternoon politely saying &#x27;I&#x27;d like to see you up your Azure training and get some certs&#x27;.
 ​
 Unfortunately, this is also after last week saying &#x27;What can we do to help you because I&#x27;m considering calling in outside help&#x27; because everyone&#x27;s started to pick up on my burnout.
 ​
 When I joined as desktop support, I was basically doing everything I was on the MSP side for these guys as helpdesk, plus it was now in person - so it was a sweet gig. 
 I started out on 60k NZD, then got bumped…</span>

 Currently we are looking for a program to take care of our security awareness program. We are looking into different vendors but currently can not seem to think of a con for Metacompliance. Basically all other vendors have at least some cons. Can you all help us with possible cons?
 Thank you in advance.

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 I&#x27;m a Sr.System Admin at University.
 We create an Azure AD account for students that serves as their email address, and SSO which allows login on public terminals in the library, access to various applications such as MS Office, PeopleSoft (student information system) etc.
 Students and Staff also bring their own devices to access all cloud-based SaaS products and applications on and off-campus
 On-campus Macs and PCs are managed using Azure Mobile Device Management (MDM). 
 My questions are:
 - Within the premise, students can connect their personal devices using wireless which only has internet access. Do you apply on the boarding checklist or MDM before granting access? We use SAML authentication.
 - Outside the premise, is it feasible to register thousands of devices into an MDM and implement a compliance checklist? Any tips and suggestions to apply to security measures to protect data and information?

 I have installed latest CU (2023-May) on my servers. 
 But , tenable is still reporting this vulnerability to us. 
 But , the MSQM service is still running on the servers and port 1801.
 I honestly thought patching will disable it after patching.
 Has anyone manually disabled MSMQ service and closed port 1801? Any issues afterward?

                              <span>Hi, 
 Not sure where to start. A bit of background, Our organisation uses office 365 for emails, teams, and excel. We save all our files onto Egnyte. 
 We have an excel spreadsheet with high level financial projections for project invoicing (45 projects) then we have a seperate excel for resourcing planning, and finally each project has 3 excels for document control management and project deliverables. All these are saved on Egnyte. 
 I’m looking to hire someone to create a digital data dashboard for each project to see the high level data in one place that’s currently spread across 100 excel sheets. I want to reduce the amount of manual data transfer and human error in data input between various seperate excel files duplicating the same data. 
 I understand a lot of this data might need aggregating into a dataset saved on the cloud and then additional applications used to process and present the data such as power bi but I do not know the order or priority of setting an outline brief for someone to price the work for our organisation. 
 Any help would be welcome. 
 I am open to radical changes in the way information is structured and push towards cloud based office 365.

                              <span>I ordered Vertical Cable keystone jacks off a recommendation from a site that are allegedly pros who install the same system as mine (ubiquiti), but ever since I installed them and patched in with pure copper patch cables, my system keeps intermittently dropping my APs randomly throughout the day. I checked the page for the keystone jacks, and come to find in the specs it says “gold plated brass connectors”… I’m not a professional or anything but I do know that connectors that are not pure copper can have issues carrying POE current (such as CCA)… I’m trying to figure out what the issue could be, and I’m wondering if the interface medium could be the culprit before I start tearing everything apart and ordering new stuff. I would assume these “ubiquiti pros” wouldn’t recommend a product that clearly doesn’t work with the POE powered APs, but stupider things have happened.

                              <span>This was a first for me... I get a ticket that BGP is down between two peers, which are connected by a carrier ethernet circuit. I can&#x27;t ping from one to the other, but both show the int is up/up. On the A side, I reset counters, and notice that my RX packets and bytes exactly matches my TX packets and bytes. Also odd, I see the A size in A&#x27;s LLDP neighbors table, showing in/out port to be the same. B side sees up/up, but BGP is down, and B can&#x27;t see anything from other side (no lldp either).
 Has anybody ever seen a carrier disconnect a circuit by making it loop back to itself? (Lumen, in this case)

                              <span>Is there any way to &quot;translate&quot; or &quot;map&quot; a device&#x27;s IP to a different IP in a L3 switch without NAT capabilities?
 My situation is: I&#x27;d like to avoid changing the device&#x27;s configuration and I need to connect several (about 30) devices with identical IPs configured, while having no IP conflicts and being able to access every individual device through HTTP.
 For example, have the &quot;192.168.1.1/24&quot; in port 1 become &quot;192.168.10.1/24&quot;, then have &quot;192.168.1.1/24&quot; in port 2 become &quot;192.168.10.2/24&quot; and so on... And then access the device in port &quot;n&quot; through &quot;192.168.10.n/24&quot; from another device, which would actually be correctly configured as &quot;192.168.10.40/24&quot;.
 Or maybe there&#x27;s a way to use the router&#x27;s NAT configs and VLANs somehow? But I don&#x27;t know if the fact that all the devices being configured in the same subnet would allow me to assign them to different VLANs, as far as I understand, each VLAN in a L3 switch should have a different subnet. I can&#x27;t picture it. Sorry if this doesn&#x27;t make sense. I know it&#x27;s not a typical use case but I figured I&#x27;d ask the experts.

                              <span>Greetings,
 This is a two part question.
 What would be a use case to have employees authenticate to AD before using company guest Wi-Fi services. I see some enterprises deploy two guest (no internal access) Wi-Fi services, one for guests and one for employees. I would like to know what benefit, other employee tracking, would be achieved by authenticating employees for guest Wi-Fi and opening the dmz to internal for this sake.
 The second question is whether any NAC product can authenticate guest Wi-Fi employee access locally via email confirmation sent to company email, I.e. by giving a temporary email only access during authentication so that the confirmation Code is received to the user on his corporate email. This is to avoid AD authentication and punching a hole from dmz to internal AD servers.
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>There must be something simple I&#x27;m missing -- ideas are appreciated.
 I have three switches (QNAP, FS, and SuperMicro), each with SFP28 (25Gb) ports. The ports works fine for connecting to servers, both using DAC cables and fiber with transceivers.
 However, I am unable to get any two of the switches to connect to each other via SFP28 ports. The ports on both sides act like nothing is connected to the port. The switches do communicate fine via RJ45 ports.
 Any idea what I&#x27;m missing here? Seems like a really basic thing to do (using SFP28 ports for uplink).

 I&#x27;m coming up empty and my searching apparently sucks.
 For those curious this is to run MACVLAN in VEPA mode.

                              <span>Hey fellow network admins,
 I wanted to get some advice on an odd issue ive been running down for a while. 
 In short, I have a medical clinic with an older Xray machine with a Linux workstation. Basically getting a lot of TCP resend requests from this device when communicating with its local PACS server ( same location, both connected to the same switch). Further investigation with packet capture, I see at the point where it fails i get a TCP ZeroWindow reply from the Xray machine
 Its my understanding that the TCP window size should be negotiated between the 2 devices in the initial SYN, and should Match. However the Xray machine shows a window of 50000, and the Server its communicating with shows 64240 for the window size. 
 Is there a way on Server 2019 to set that window size? I found regfixes that were for server 2003, but did not work. I also turned off autotuning, no change. 
 The Xray machine is old, so I&#x27;m suspecting that&#x27;s what we are running into, but I wanted to confirm if I had any options to set this on my server side.

                              <span>Just asking to confirm.
 I want to do a config replace on all of our edge switches. The goal is to ensure consistency and make sure all the configs are the same. So going to make a golden config and push it out to all switches with a config replace.
 With doing this, there is no reason the switch needs to reboot, correct? Just want to make sure no one is going to lose connectivity when doing this.

                              <span>Hey everybody just a quick question this morning for yeah. I’m primarily an end user support tech but my company no longer has a network engineer so I’ve gotten to take up most of the projects they would be working on. I haven’t played around with networking topologies or just about anything except an Ethernet cable for the last few years. 
 My question is if I am installing ip cameras that will be powered with PoE should I be using 568A or 568B? I’ve looked up a few things online but nothing is super straight forward or giving me one linear answer. 
 Any help is massively appreciated!

                              <span>So I am trying to understand the benefit of VLANs and how they work still. Hopefully I can clearly and concisely explain my setup and confusion.
 In this example network topology, there is currently zero VLAN or network segmentation. We have one WAN feeding a Fortinet Firewall, with the Fortinet configured for DHCP relay pointing to a 2012 R2 server. This server only has one scope that all devices live in. The scope is 10.10.8.1/22 (but only handing IPs out from 10.10.8.10 - 10.10.9.248). Then the Fortinet is feeding a few miscellaneous switches that are essentially dummy switches all daisy chained together feeding them. There is zero configuration on them.
 So now I have a new HP 1920S switch I would like to integrate. And I would like to segment 36 out of the 48 ports of this switch into 3 different VLANs that cannot interact with our main 10.10.8.1/22 network. The groups being VLAN10; ports 1-12, VLAN20; ports 13-24, and VLAN30; ports 25-36, while using port 48 as a trunk for the 3 VLANs. This &quot;trunk&quot; (HP terms) is being fed into the piggybacked dummy switches. But when I test the isolation of these VLANs by plugging in two devices across two different VLAN segments, I can still ping eachother. This is where I think my lack of foundational network knowledge is hurting me...
 Even though I have 3 different VLANs configured on the switch, do I also need to create 3 different DHCP scopes to truly separate the various VLAN traffic from each other and the rest of the 10.10.8.1/22 network? If so, how do I tell the relevant VLAN traffic to be assigned to these new particular DHCP scopes? Is that done through more configuration in the HP switch, itself? I am trying to determine if I setup VLAN incorrectly and it&#x27;s not behaving how it should, or it&#x27;s setup correctly and my understanding isn&#x27;t correct.
 I hope this makes sense. Thank you for any input!

                              <span>Hello. Just wondering if there are folks here who worked with migrating legacy circuits to ethernet based network. We have a customer who is trying to abandon their old network that consists a lot of FR/HDLC/PPP interfaces. They are currently connected to a channelized STM1 interface of a Cisco ASR9000 router. The core network is running MPLS but they want to move the connections to the newer ASR9900 routers while they convince customers to move to ethernet and they no longer want to introduce legacy circuit types into the 9900 routers (not sure if there&#x27;s any module that still supports it there) The interfaces consists of L3VPN and L2VPN doing interworking. Are there any suggestions here on what device we can possibly put in to migrate those legacy circuits into a separate box so that we just connect that box into the ASR9900 as ethernet? There are suggestions that we use an ASR 1000 as the CE for these connections. Any other products outside Cisco shop? Thanks in advance.

 The thing is this. Each time I tried to configure WPA3 or WPA3+WPA2, there will be a &quot;Please Correct Error&quot; thing that comes out. After waiting for some time, 5 Ghz encryption always goes back to &#x27;None - Open&#x27;.
 Was anyone able to configure 5Ghz encryption successfully to WPA3+WPA2?

 Hope the Reddit Gods can help me out with this one.
 So I have one switch with two ports aggregated and using LACP. They connect to a stack switch with two members, to one port on each member. The two ports on the stack are also a part of a LAG with LACP enabled.
 My question is should one member of the stack die what exactly happens after the LACP timeout occurs on the other member?
 Thank you

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I hope someone here can point me in the right direction where to start because I have been trying but cannot figure out what&#x27;s happening:
 Issue:Both my MacMini as well as my MacBook have problems connecting to my Private WiFi (Guest WiFi works fine). Once connected get assigned an IPv4 Address but loose it right away and assign themselves an IPv6 Address. The IPv4 Information in the macOS Settings is empty. Once I click on &quot;Renew DHCP Lease&quot; it gets assigned an IP again and Connection works for around 10 seconds before it disappears again.
 Setup:Devices: MacBook Pro 2015, MacMini M1Network: Ubiquity Unifi Dream Machine, Connected via WiFi to main Network, already opened a ticket with support but they told me the logs look fine and they cannot find anything. The Devices appear as offline in the Unifi Interface despite being connected.
 Is this a Unifi Issue or a macOS Issue? Where can I start to look for fixesThanks so much in advance for any help!!

 The question may sound stupid, because there are a lot of articles and videos showing how to do this. But it doesn&#x27;t work for me.
 What I did:
  
I set SSLKEYLOGFILE environment variable
 Rebooted my computer
 I&#x27;ve run Wireshark and was surfing a site I want to see a traffic for
 Stopped Wireshark. The log file isn&#x27;t empty.
 In Wireshark, I went to Edit/Preferences/Protocols/TLS and for input field (Pre)-Master-Secret log filename I set path to file which I&#x27;ve set path to in SSLKEYLOGFILE variable
  
After all that I see following in Wireshark: https://ibb.co/qBm0Kc3
 I use Windows 10 and Wireshark 4.0.5
 How can I fix that?

                              <span>Hello guys,
 We have finalllyyyyyy gotten some test lab hardware.
 So now i am playing with 2 nexus 9k&#x27;s and have upgraded them to 10.3.3.F ( in production today we are running 9.3.10 ).
 And the most wanted feature has been commit and rollback like we have on XR&#x27;s.
 With the conf dual-stage that is now a thing on nexus&#x27;es running code 10.1(2) or newer.
 What are your thoughts on this, and also have you guys used it?
 Main thing that annoys me a bit, is that it doesn&#x27;t replace configure ( conf t ).
 And also that you cannot do a config banner, to remind people that they should use conf dual-stage

 I have an issue where some devices dont get an ip address in certain subnet. For example in floor one everything works including the problematic devices. In floor 2 everything works except 1 desktop and few cisco meeting room touch panels. Both device are in the same vlan including laptops and the laptops work perfectly, its the same vlan and the same dhcp server, also cisco phones and access points work perfectly as well but on different vlans Note: each floor has each own broadcast domain and the address range is not fully utilaized I have run wireshark and the dhcp offer packet is missing., I see the device request an apipanaddress from the dhcp and the dhcp is replying with NAK massage Any idea why this specific devices wouldnt get dhcp?
 Thanks for help

                              <span>Hi all,
 Been working as a network admin/engineer for the past 7 years, based primarily on Aruba WiFi &amp; Switching/Arista Switch/Cisco Routing/Palo Alto firewalls &amp; SD-WAN/F5 load balancers &amp; also Splunk. 
 I have been presented an opportunity for a role as a senior network engineer. The role is based on Fortinet SD-WAN/Firewalls, Ubiquiti WiFI/Switching. Company consists of a large number of sites, though the sites are small in size, so Ubiquiti makes sense for their business requirements. 
 Something that is making me hesitant, is the fact that this company is using Ubiquiti WiFi/Switching &amp; doesn&#x27;t sound like there is much of a solid plan to move away from this to an enterprise solution. The cash for this role is more than what I am currently on, but I am a little concerned that by taking the role, my skills with enterprise equipment will squander, and it will be hard to move into a more enterprise role in the future. 
 I use Ubiquiti equipment at home, and it is fine, but not sure I&#x27;d use it an enterprise setting. 
 TLDR: If I take a role working on Ubiquiti equipment, will this tarnish my resume/skillset?

 I&#x27;m hoping for some advice/guidance. I&#x27;ve been in this field since 2009 starting as an intern at a large service provider. My career trajectory looks like this:
 associate switch technician (maintaining all the equipment that processed voice and data cellular calls) --&gt; &quot;systems technician&quot; which meant setting up the data center at the same service provider and then maintaining the routers and switches --&gt; brief stint working on one of their application platforms after years of data center work --&gt; got laid off and went to work in a NOC doing actual troubleshooting and some software upgrades / hardware upgrades with remote hands --&gt; bouncing around jobs every couple years as a network engineer, almost entirely doing the routing/switching side of things.

                              <span>TL;DR - Zoom sucks as a voice platform and apparently someone is spoofing our DIDs. Is this really an up and coming attack businesses are facing or is Zoom compromised and/or buggy and dialing themselves. 
 We use Zoom as our voice platform and recently (within the last week) we started getting reports that just seemed odd. It started with a few users stating that people were calling their DID numbers and saying they were returning a missed call. The two users swore that they never called these people and one was a current customer and the other some random person. The strange thing was that there was no record of an outbound call to either of these callers in the zoom portal phone logs. These two users attributed it to some glitch in the matrix and moved on with their lives.

                              <span>I need to start assembling some quotes for NTP appliances for our Small-Medium Enterprise environment. 
 I want something that can pull GPS time, and Internet NTP, and maybe FM radio time. 
 We currently use our core ASR routers and I want to shift that responsibility off the routers (so they can just be standard NTP clients) and onto something with a precision hardware clock. 
 We are financial services, but have no requirement for PTP, So I just need NTPv4. 
 I might upgrade from a standard clock to an OCXO style oscillator, but we don&#x27;t need Rubidium precision. 
 I&#x27;ll probably buy four appliances.
 One in each data center, one in each major user site.
 Our data centers have historically difficult GPS reception, so I don&#x27;t want to put all four in the 2 data centers. 
 The Symmetricom / Microsemi / Microchip S600 appliance is one product we&#x27;ll get quotes on. 
 The Meinberg LANTime M1000 is another contender. 
 The Meinberg SyncFire 1200 feels like an updated M1000, so I&#x27;ll explore that further as well. 
  
What other products in this space should I be looking at? 
  
Microsemi&#x27;s Domain Time NTP client for Windows (and other OSes).
 Is this something worth exploring, or should I just leave Microsoft&#x27;s w32time alone?
 I hate the way the PDC-emulator is the only device that feeds time into the rest of the domain.
 It violates the inherent resiliency of the NTP protocol&#x27;s design. 
  
As always, the wisdom of the great collective is always appreciated.

                              <span>Hi everyone, i don&#x27;t know if this subreddit is the right one, but i have a question about an implementataion of SAP B1 with a SUSE DB.
 The problem appears when the consultant wants to share a folder from the SUSE Server with a Guest account, but in my domain the Group policy that allows that is disable by default. They say SAP established that is imperative to make the change to work.
 They gave me a microsoft KB (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-US/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/guest-access-in-smb2-is-disabled-by-default) to disable that policy and the shared folder works, but its an insecure practice and no one recommend it.
 It appers that the top management is going to push for this to happen.. Is this really the only way to do it as they say? can it be done in a more secure way? do i cross my arms when a ramsonware fuck things up?
 thanks in advance

                              <span>As the title says I’m curious as to what professions former sysadmins have gone to?
 I’ve been working over a decade in the field but I’m burnt out &amp; simply over it…fielding the seemingly endless on-call duties, addressing security breaches in the middle of the night, or ruined weekend plans due to emergency maintenance. 
 I’ve had enough as it’s not worth the compensation or my mental health (been dealing with panic attacks that seemingly popped up out of nowhere - as someone who doesn’t experience them often, it’s been terrifying).
 But yeah, just looking for suggestions and feedback on what day jobs you all have migrated to since leaving IT…I continue to work on my side hustle that I hope to eventually transition to full time but until that day comes I’ve still gotta hustle.

 Reached out to Microsoft, multiple times and no one understood the issue until finally were now supposedly waiting for a call from an engineer in the identity team. It’s been almost 2 weeks now with no real response other than a rep offering to make a note on a tik. 
 Anyone know of a resource to expedite this?

 These are instructions for how to update java on your server. Ya know, java, the software with new and amazing critical vulnerabilities every other week. Well, BMC&#x27;s solution for updating java for their java based software is that you need to hand edit dozens of files, registry keys, and environmental variables every single time. And because its java and it updates constantly you&#x27;ll be doing it over and over. You&#x27;d better hope to god there were no mistakes either because remedy also generates hundreds of logs in improbable locations containing what might as well be alien hieroglyphs. This issue is one of hundreds of problems with this software. 
 One time I had to get a developer on the line (which took an act of god and over a week) because I followed their own instructions and it blew up my system. He told me the support article in question missed a critical step that would always blow up your system if you didn&#x27;t do it. Apparently, updating the support articles was an ongoing project.
 My company is currently trying to switch vendors and I will do everything in my power to make it happen. If you have this software god help you.

 What are you/HR using and is it current and relevant?
 Thanks all.

                              <span>You could file this under a few dysfunctional categories. Full disclosure - I’m a people manager now, still wear quite a few hats, used to be a sysadmin, and I felt this rant slotted well here…
 So, I&#x27;m in the middle of driving my morning IT operations meeting and I&#x27;m getting Teams calls and messages from HR. ADP is “not working” and ADP is on the phone with HR saying that it&#x27;s a problem with our firewall.
 HR wanted me to join the call but I told them I didn&#x27;t have a problem statement from ADP to warrant IT involvement, but I&#x27;d investigate. I asked a few questions, gathered some errors and application behavior from HR, and then gathered some observations from some people on my team.
 Notable symptoms: people in HR couldn&#x27;t access some company personnel management features in the mobile app or web portal, users at home couldn&#x27;t access all features in the mobile app. Similar issues affecting multiple platforms on different networks.
 I informed HR via Teams that our firewall isn&#x27;t selective like that and the information gathered offers strong evidence that it&#x27;s something on ADP’s side that changed.
 Well, I was right. Sort of. Root cause? Accounts Payable failed to pay our ADP bill.

 So 7:45 this morning I am fumbling with my keys to open my door juggling my gear and a half cup of coffee just trying to get in my door when one of our older office workers comes running (as much as an older lady can) to tell me about an alarm on the fire panel that is going off 
 The alarm panels are not my area, but facilities won&#x27;t be in for a while and I know my way around them, so I ask what the alarm is for. Some of our extinguishers have sensors that detect if they get used o…</span>

 Digging through the logs it was caused by slidetoshutdown.exe and upon recreating the scenario and testting with my touchscreen tablet and a test VM I was able to recreate it.
 by holding the power button on the tablet to trigger the local slidetoshutdown if you&#x27;re also full screen RDP to a Windows machine it will also launch slidetoshutdown.exe dragging that window down will shut down the remote machine.
 can&#x27;t find a gpo to disable it, not keen on replacing the exe, trying a disallow applocker rule for now.
 crazy that this is the first time I&#x27;ve heard of it happening considering how easy it is to do accidentally.

 Then trying to get hiring process going this year, we’ve been hit with all kinds of starts and stops only be finally told today that they need the budget to hire some AI devs.

 Any advice on what to say to them? Any advice on what to do to keep people sane and organized?

 ​
 My boss says it should be fine, I think &quot;everything that can go wrong will go wrong&quot; especially since the ISP does not send us a protocol for the visit but only tells the person on location what things we have to install ourselves

                              <span>I&#x27;m a systems admin for a medium-sized org, and not super familiar with AWS, but wanting to know actual best practices for the scenario below. Please forgive the inexperience behind the question:
 Basically, our Dev team is moving a lot of dependencies for their apps away from local resources and more into our cloud environment. Currently, our media team writes directly to an on-prem FTP server and the dev team pulls the data from the FTP server and loads it into an S3 bucket. We have an application that pulls the content from the S3 bucket (as far as I&#x27;m aware). 
 Our lead dev asked if there was a way to connect our local network to an S3 bucket in AWS so that we can have our media team write their stuff directly to the S3 bucket rather than the local FTP server. I&#x27;m more familiar with Azure, so I had to do some digging as to how to make this happen. My initial thought is setting up a VPN to our VPC in AWS, but I may be way off on that. However, our IT Director is on an 8-week leave, and from a strategy perspective, I&#x27;m not sure if I&#x27;m the right person to make the call, as I&#x27;m still fairly new to the org.
 From what I&#x27;ve researched, there is a way to mount an S3 bucket to a local Linux server. My understanding is that the local host would act as a proxy that would eliminate the need to manually move the content into the S3 bucket.
 Am I off on this? For those who have had a similar scenario, could you please share what you did? Telling the dev team to kick rocks until our director gets back to have a more broad design discussion is not out of the question, but I figured I would do my homework before I did so.

 We have an rather old 2012 R2 server as our only 2012 server remaining. Rather than just creating a new VM and setting them up again is this really the best approach in 2023? We don&#x27;t currently use Azure besides 365 and nobody has P1 licenses for most Azure features.
 I&#x27;ve also seen solutions like printlogic which could be a good alternative however we also have an EFI Fiery printer. 
 ​
 Any recomendations in this modern age on best practice for servers? It&#x27;s also the first time i&#x27;ve setup a print server post print nightmare!

                              <span>Does anyone know if it&#x27;s possible to synchronize computer account attributes to Azure with AD Connect? We&#x27;re specifically looking to sync the description attribute in our case. It doesn&#x27;t appear that the directory extensions listed in AD Connect include any additional computer account attributes as options to sync.

                              <span>Hi, I read that Microsoft Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server will be deprecated 30 September 2024. 
 Source : https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/azure-multifactor-authentication-server-will-be-deprecated-30-september-2024/
 I only use Office 365 for mail, calendar, etc...
 Some users and in particular admin of Office 365 organization use SMS or Auth APP as 2 steps authentication.
 I don&#x27;t really understand if I&#x27;m concerned by this deprecated. Someone can give me more information ?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi guys, i have an unusual problem.
 My PKI setup (which i inherited) consists of an offline root CA, an enteprise CA and another server with IIS for the http CRL availability.
 My Root CA CRL is expiring soon so i wanted to renew it.
 What i did:
 Fired up the Root CA, published the new CRL, copied the file to my Enterprise CA, used the command
 certutil -f -dspublish Root-CA.crl
 command completed succesfully, then copied the same CRL to the web server, restarted IIS.
 What happened:
 On pkiview i see that the CDP Location2 (the http) one is ok
 the cdp location 1 (ldap location) still shows the old CRL expiring date, it looks like it didn&#x27;t renew it.
 i do this every year and last time i didn&#x27;t have any issues.
 Any suggestions?
 Thanks for the help.

Seems that it&#x27;s about 30% of one of my orgs at the moment and just seems very strange that it was a patch rolled out yesterday...

                              <span>I am trying to get vlan working on lenovo thunderbolt dock. It is connected to tagged port passing multiple vlan and native lan using unifi switch. When i connect my Lenovo laptop or Dell xps 13 laptop I am able to use ethernet port without any issues including other features of thunderbolt port but i get connected to native vlan.
 When I go to windows and add vlan id to the network adapter, I do not get an ip assigned and it shows as unidentified network. If I had one laptop to use with the dock, I could have kept the port as untagged. I have the latest firmware on the dock along with drivers on both laptops.
 Previously i was using USB c dock and was able to use the feature without any issue. Any idea what can be the issue? Hopefully its not the dock, contains realtek ethernet port.

                              <span>Hi,
 We were having an issue with installing Feb 2023 .Net for Windows Server 2019 and also some Windows Server 2019 CU&#x27;s. Fixes that we found online included the below, none of which worked: 
  
Running sfc /scannow (never runs, always says a reboot is pending, even when we found a fix around this running sfc /scannow did nothing
 Running various DISM commands that were recommended didnt&#x27;t get us anywhere
 Tried extracting the update /cab files and installing them individually using DISM
  
My colleague found a fix which I am sharing here:
  
Take ownership of the following registry key then delete it:
  
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Component Based Servicing\DriverOperations\0 2. Reboot the server - Sometimes the server will go through in percentages so let it be till it&#x27;s completed, it can take 5 or 10 minutes 3. Try installing .Net Framework again - Upon a reboot, Windows will indicate with a &quot;We couldn&#x27;t complete the updates&quot; message that it couldn&#x27;t install the update but it will continue installing it anyway 4. Install the latest CU - After a reboot it will be stuck on &quot;Working on updates: 100% Complete&quot; for 7- hours so leave the server to finish updating overnight

                              <span>Hi.
 I have a c-level user who just had his XPS motherboard replaced (2nd time in 18 months). After logging in, his Outlook, Teams and OneDrive are not connecting. Error is https://i.imgur.com/2QxOJCr.png
 The official Dell doc on this issues says to rename C:\users\\AppData\Local\Packages\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy, then reboot. But this isn&#x27;t working. I have also renamed the other folder in that article, with no luck. 
 I&#x27;ve done a lot of googling on this issue and most responses say renaming the AAD folder above and rebooting fixed the issue.
 The TPM module is working according to powershell &quot;get-tpm&quot;. 
 Anyone got any other tips to try? The last resort seems to be re-creating the user profile.

                              <span>For our startup, we plan to provide technical support through some kind of ticketing system (necessarily free and open-source, since we are not planning to pay for Zendesk/Jira right now).
 What options can you advise if on the client side we want to see a simple window with online chat, and on our side the system with tickets, some information about the client (mail, country, etc.). If there will even be some metrics and a way to measure them - great. In general, free and more or less working analogue of Zendesk/Jira for text messaging.
 I&#x27;m thinking to do it via bot in Telegram, but I&#x27;m not sure if it will be convenient if there will be more than 100 clients.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been having a really strange issue with UAC and RDP for quite a while now and wondered if anyone else had come across similar
 Most of the time I&#x27;ll &#x27;Run as Administrator&#x27;, UAC prompt pops up, enter my admin credentials and no problems, same with RDP I&#x27;ll enter my credentials to login and connect in (not run as admin in that scenario, just a standard RDP process)
 However every so often with no pattern I&#x27;ll open a UAC or RDP prompt, enter my credentials and click OK and they just completely freeze up, UAC will eventually quit out after 5-10 minutes without opening anything, if I try and interact with the RDP prompt it sometimes comes up with &#x27;Credential manager UI host is not responding&#x27;
 If I simply restart my PC it all works fine for a bit again before breaking again hours/days/weeks later out of the blue
 I&#x27;ve rebuilt my PC (I say PC, it&#x27;s actually a VM) several times from scratch and it always comes back to haunt me eventually, happened with various Windows 10 builds and now I&#x27;m on Windows 11 22H2 but still the same and I&#x27;ve checked I&#x27;m fully up to date with Windows Update
 Does anyone have any ideas as it is starting to annoy me!

                              <span>Backstory:
 Previously I was a system engineer working in a devops environment, apart of sustainment and test team. I enjoyed this position because I was always learning something new, and the work was never stagnant. I ended up leaving to finish up my bachelor’s in a remote position.
 Now having completed my bachelor’s, and even before then, I have lost all motivation in this role. The overall company environment isn’t completely horrible but it is severely lacking( the people are nice). Overall the lack of job motivation has also pushed into my self learning. In my previous role, I always had the urge to self learn to stay on top of the environment I was working on.
 I feel like I’m stuck in this role. In the past few months I have had overall positive interviews but no bites. Usually because my clearance is still processing or lacked skill in one area leaving me has the “silver trophy winner”.
 Tl;dr: Current role I lost all motivation, but feel like I’m stuck

                              <span>Hi, we&#x27;re having a weird issue where some of our Windows Servers are jumping back and forth in time. 
 The worst example is one server jumping several years into the future(!) messing up our databases and applications running. Most of the servers are on vmware esxi hosts. I cant find anything in the OS logs that points to what exactly is the cause of it. Time-sync between host and VM is disabled as well. 
 ​
 From one server where it recently jumped three days into the future before reverting to the correct date and time some hours later:
 ​
 Event viewer logs Kernel-General Event ID 1:
 The system time has changed to ‎2023‎-‎05‎-‎18T09:39:30.714000000Z from ‎2023‎-‎05‎-‎15T00:23:08.061881200Z.
 Change Reason: An application or system component changed the time.
 ​
 No snapshots are taken in this time period that could be the trigger for the VM to synch time with its host. Has anyone seen this before or could guide me in the right direction?

                              <span>Hello all. Just got in a new batch of HP Zbook 15.6&quot; Power G9s. Out the box they are a headache. BIOS is set for PXE. Once I am in the MDT environment I have no mouse pad(this becomes a heeadache when i am doing multiple machines at a time). Biggest issue is when it starts to go through the task list, I cannot get the drivers to inject. I have loaded the laptop drivers into the deployment server, as well as the updated WinPE drivers. I have tried with both secure boot on amd secure boot off. Not sure what I am missing here. Any help is appreciated.

                              <span>We’ve been using WUfB (via Intune) and the driver option but have had 2-3 issues in 6 months where released drivers cause problems with audio, cameras and docks.
 We are co managed but would prefer to use Intune and not sccm for this, so what other options are available?
 I’ve looked at commercial vantage but wonder if we would see the same issues as WUfB here, but I’d rather not go back to the days of testing an approving every other driver update if I can help it either!

 There was a list of missing drivers in the device manager&#x27;s other devices category, so i tried to update via intelligent provisioning. There were no errors in the update proccess and after.
 But after i reboot, it wants me to plug in two power supplies, so i did and the amber blinking sign on health disappeared. But when i go back to intelligent provisioning, it shows self update and then it says error while loading shared libraries. 
 How do I fix this? https://i.imgur.com/PcV0Dse.jpg https://i.imgur.com/nvgrGOu.jpg

                              <span>Hi all. Just wondering if anyone is aware of a way to add existing devices to the OEM listing for AutoPilot? I was looking to push DFCI settings via Intune, but our devices are from Dell but all enrolled manually (Hardware Hash uploads), or by converting Hybrid devices, so the DFCI isn&#x27;t available to us direct. We have access to things such as the TechDirect setup at Dell, so wondering if there&#x27;s a way to &#x27;confirm&#x27; device ownership to allow this?
 Long shot and not the end of the world if it doesn&#x27;t work, but I thought worth asking!

                              <span>We have 4 office buildings dotted around a yard, currently using Netgear Orbi 6E but due to the fact the buildings are more than wifi range apart (though connected by wired LAN) the satellite nodes cannot communicate with the primary gateway node. That means I can&#x27;t update them in place, I have to disconnect them and bring them into the same building to run updates. I think it&#x27;s also causing satellites to inexplicably stop working every few months until they&#x27;re restarted.
 Is there any 6E mesh system which doesn&#x27;t mind if the nodes can&#x27;t talk to each other over wifi? I&#x27;d really have expected just being on the same wired LAN would have been okay with the Orbi but no such luck. I don&#x27;t really mind if it&#x27;s consumer, the Orbi experience is very consumer despite being marketed to businesses. Wifi is secondary to ethernet in our offices, I just want a system that doesn&#x27;t require frequent manual interventions.

                              <span>Hi
 One of our servers, running Windows Server 2016 Standard, is having issues communicating with our Domain Controller (same OS).
 DNS is fine, with all the usual ping tests showing no issues:
 Ping server
 Ping example.local
 Ping server.example.local
 Signing into the problematic server is intermittently slow, with the following error messages being present:
 The Security System is auditing a downgrade attempt when contacting the 3-part SPN 
 E3514235-4B06-11D1-AB04-00C04FC2DCD2/2611a202-62d5-4d03-923f-feb1cf81e719/EXAMPLE.local 
 with error code &quot;There are currently no logon servers available to service the logon request. (0xc000005e)&quot;. --- The Security System is auditing a downgrade attempt when contacting the 3-part SPN 
 ldap/SERVER.EXAMPLE.local/EXAMPLE.local@EXAMPLE.LOCAL 
 with error code &quot;There are currently no logon servers available to service the logon request. (0xc000005e)&quot;.
 I believe we have isolated it to the security update KB5011233 - after uninstalling and rebooting the server on Friday, it worked fine; however it was reinstalled over the weekend and the issue is now recurring.
 I&#x27;ve looked online and tried a few fixes, but so far aside from uninstalling the update, I haven&#x27;t been able to fix this.
 Does anyone have any suggestions?

                              <span>Hello Guys,
 I come to you to get some advise and opinions, maybe some insight, on who should be the owner of a shared folder. We had the issue this morning with someone who didn&#x27;t have access since we couldn&#x27;t properly re-inherit the permissions to the subfolders.
 The issue was that some folders were owned by User A, Creator of some subfolders, and not by User B, Owner of the Main shared folder.
 Normally it looks something like this. See picture below.
 Imgur Picture
 In my experience the Owner usually is the local Administrator or the group &quot;Domain Admin&quot;. For now we have put &quot;Domain Users&quot; and we have added each user (not like on the picture) manually. Meaning that we don&#x27;t yet work with an AD group that gets assigned to each user for access instead of each user is manually added.
 So my question is the following. Is it ok to leave &quot;Domain Users&quot; as owners or should be put &quot;Domain Admins&quot;? Is it maybe a security issue or cause other problems? It&#x27;s been years since I&#x27;ve done it myself and I don&#x27;t remember who I put as owner on those cases.

If i put the same setting static IP ect in the old Motorola MC9190 (We are trying to replace the old Motorola with the Zebra) they connect right away and can use the AS400 emulation app with no issues. 
 Started a couple weeks ago and driving me nuts. Anyone else use these scanners?

                              <span>On multiple occasions now the threat policies that you define in the security center have malfunctioned heavily. We have tested this heavily, let&#x27;s say we have three outbound spam policies:
 ​
 - No Send Limit (Unlimited)
 - Test Send Limit (5)
 - Default Policy (500)
 ​
 1) Scoped a user to policy &quot;Test Send Limit&quot; and sent out 50 mails. User was restricted from sending in the Security Portal and an alert was triggered. But mails could be sent out half a day later without problems and the user was still blocked in the portal.
 2) Scoped a user to policy &quot;No Send Limit&quot;. Multiple days passed, so enough time was given for the policy to be active in M365. Suddenly, user was restricted after sending out 500 mails as if the default policy applied. This can never be because the default policy has the lowest priority and therefore explicit policies always take precedence.
 ​
 This was raised as a ticket at Microsoft and escalated and I did supply them lots of information over multiple weeks. I never got the resolution to the problem and at some point they just stopped answering my mails.

                              <span>Hello
 Since OD / SharePoint Online has been introduced in this company there has been a weird problem around.
 If I upload a file about 500MB or bigger to the cloud, synchronize it&#x27;s directory to my local storage and then try to open it, I get the error &quot;the rpc server is unavailable&quot;.
 The second try it always works and I&#x27;ve already checked/tried the following points:
 · Firewall
 · Tried different networks
 · Checked that the following services are up &amp; running: -Remote Procedure Call (RPC), RPC Endpoint Mapper &amp; DCOM Server Process Launcher
 · ipconfig /flushdns
 · Can&#x27;t trace the network traffic because OD&#x27;s traffic is encrypted
 The problem affects all clients in the company and I&#x27;ve never had it in any other OD/SharePoint environment, is anyone familiar with the issue and may even know the cause / a solution?
 Thanks in advance and have a nice day.

 The value had changed to &quot;Microsoft managed&quot; in our case because we had disabled it before 5/17. Now that it&#x27;s been set again it sounds like it will stick, but this was pretty sneaky. We disabled it in order to shunt people to the full Microsoft Authenticator, which has a couple other key features.
 ​
  
Updated May 17, 2023: Today we are starting rollout for Authenticator Lite (in Outlook) to enter GA! The Microsoft managed value of this feature will be changed from ‘disabled’ to ‘enabled’ on June 9th. We have made some changes to the feature configuration, so if you made an update before GA (5/17), please validate that the feature is in the correct state for your tenant prior to June 9th. If you do not wish for this feature to be enabled on June 9th, move the state to ‘disabled’ or set users to include and exclude groups.
  
Authenticator Lite (in Outlook) is a feature that allows your users to complete multi-factor authentication for their work or school account using Outlook on their iOS or Android device. This feature will be enabled on June 9th for all tenants that have not disabled it. If you do not wish for this feature to be enabled on June 9th, move the state to ‘disabled’ or set user include and exclude groups prior to June 9th.

                              <span>On our network we have partnered with a local PD. Basically we have a campus in a high crime area. Local PD approached us about tapping into outdoor cameras to have live viewing (Decision is made and way above my pay grade). I walked into the network we have and I am in the process to make it better.
 Basically the PD uses a third party (FUSUS) that goes on our network and has access to certain cameras over IP and a read user of the camera. Device needs internet access and access to 5-6 specific cameras.
 I plan to put the device on an &quot;Unmanaged Device&quot; subnet/vlan add policies to our firewalls as well as acls at the switch level. Anything else I can do to help?

 There is a quite a bit of fuzz regarding full stack network engineers and their demand in future. Can someone guide on what exactly we need to be equipped with in order to be one?

Is this even allowed because I read somewhere VPC doesn&#x27;t support L3.

                              <span>I have 3 different network racks in different buildings that are in desperate need of some love. Over the years the cables have gotten tangled together and looped around so much that I can barely get my hands in there to unplug them from the switch, let alone try and pull the cable and trace it back to the patch-panel. 
 The one that is my main priority has over used 300 switchports and 11x 48-port patch-panels. There are 2 racks, one with 6 patches on the top half and the other with 5 patches on the top and switches on the bottom half. There are cable organizers on the racks but they are overflowing and literally will not fit a single cable more.
 I have never taken on something of this scale before so I want to make sure I&#x27;m not getting in over my head.
 What has been your guys&#x27; experience? Any tips and tricks for tackling this problem?

If you expect to find SSID in this location. go ahead and connect. Otherwise. it may be a different network with the same name. Show certificate details - Connect/Cancel
 Has anyone faced the same/similar issues?

 This company is managing around 2000 customer and has been operating for 10 years.
 To me it seems like a really big deal.
 But I am not sure how to address this to my boss or superior.
 I just joined and starting to peaking faults at the very beginning doesn&#x27;t seem like a good idea but again I can&#x27;t overlook the security risk.
 How should I proceed ?

 Connect failed:(30044) No available encryption algorithms match with the server
 I know the security implication, but we are going to slowly upgrade all the machines.
 In the meantime, do you know of any workaround? I usually use Putty and allow weaker cipher/algorithms, but I can&#x27;t find the way on Cattools.

 So we have a new site setup and it&#x27;s up, no users yet in the site.
 We have a couple of PCs setup for testing and are planning to test application performance on the PCs over the network 
 What tools are available for this and does anyone have any experience in doing this?
 What else do we have to test? (I&#x27;m sure everything will be fine anyways since there won&#x27;t be too many users initially and total users will still be 500-600 max for the site in the long term but still need to test).
 We have 3750 switches as access switches which are temporary (will be replaced by 9300s when they arrive). And nexus 9k switches as core in a Cisco 2-tier deployment with 2 gig redundant links back to the data center (which is like 10 miles away).
 Edit: can iperf be used for stress testing?
 Thank you

                              <span>Morning everyone! 
 We currently use Clover as our PCI compliant pen testing that our bank states we must use but from my experience they are extremely terrible. Does anyone have any advice on a good pen testing company to check out? I was think Nessus or maybe Rapid7.

                              <span>Does anyone have any good resources for best practices on a outdoor IP camera topology design? We are running into issues today with being able to reliable provide connectivity to cameras in large parking lots or fields (multiple acres). 
 Cameras installed on the exterior of the building are fine as we can home run them to our MDF/IDFs and the distance are typically under 100m. Where we run into issues is with our PTZ cameras on the outer part of the property which are typically over 100m from the closest MDF/IDF. Additionally, these cameras for the most part have a 60w/90w PoE requirement. 
 While each camera is over 100m from the closest MDF/IDF they are sometimes within 100m of a few neighboring cameras on poles/property edge. 
 We&#x27;ve gone down the rabbit hole of ethernet extenders, PoE extenders, fiber converters with PoE injectors, P2P wireless systems (separate from our wireless deployment), and they all are hit or miss. 
 Should we be looking a ring topology and deploying small outdoor PoE switches on the pole and connect as many cameras as we can, and the daisy chain of that switch via fiber to the next one? Or should we deploy a couple of edge switches in NEMA cabinets on the ground and feed as many cameras as we can from them?
 Appreciate any insight, experience, or resources anyone has for a situation like this.

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t found anything definitive on the internet and it bothers me. 
 2 different ISP lines are plugged into a switch (HP Procurve). 2 more ports on that same switch go to the router. The router is programmed with the static IPs for the two ISPs and it just works. There are no VLANS setup and in fact no management at all done on the switch.
 Why does this work without any VLANs setup on the switch and router?
 Is there any concerns with this setup.

 Sorry if this is an oddly specific post, but I didn&#x27;t see a sub for Dell Networking, and the SNMP sub seems to be dead. If there is a sub for this kind of question, I&#x27;d love to check it out. I&#x27;ve made a post on the Dell forum without any success.
 In the process of implementing IPv6 on my university network, I&#x27;m trying log IPv6 Neighbor Table entries via SNMP, to have records available indicating which host had which IPv6 address. I&#x27;ve been able to query my Cisco switches without a problem, and can get the desired IPv4 data from the Dell switches (I&#x27;m also doing ARP tables), but the IPv6 queries are returning unusable data.
 When querying IPV6-MIB::ipv6NetToMediaNetAddress using snmpwalk, I get the message No Such Object available on this agent at this OID.
 When querying IPV6-MIB…</span>

 question! so i currently work in film and 2.4 is massively busy. for this reason i have taken my opted to not allow the 2.4 band to be used when connecting to my ubiquity AP&#x27;s. 
 will my aps even though they&#x27;re not using 2.4 still causing interference with other devices on the same 2.4 channel?

 Thanks!

 I&#x27;m currently working in a dual role as a Network Security Engineer and Network Engineer, and I hold CCNP Enterprise (ENARSI), CCNP Security (SNCF), and CCSE - Checkpoint certifications. My daily work involves dealing with Checkpoint, ASA, FMC, as well as Cisco routers and switches. I come from a smaller country where complex routing needs seem to be dwindling as many networks are transitioning to firewall-focused designs, with exceptions for configurations like DMVPN.
 Both network security and routing are areas that I am passionate about, but I&#x27;m at a crossroads in terms of my career progression. My daily tasks involve a lot of security-related work, but the routing experience I&#x27;m gaining is mainly limited to BGP. I&#x27;m continuously reading documentation, learning, and lab…</span>

                              <span>Hi! 
 I am going to Cisco Live in Las Vegas and have signed up for the CCT (Cisco Certified Technician) exam.
 Have been working with networking for about 6 years and feel like I have a good knowledge in the field, but I guess there is still a lot of exam specific things I should look into before going. 
 Does anyone have recommendations to content that could be helpful for this?

                              <span>Hi guys. A few years ago I bought a crimping tool which worked great. I&#x27;m wanting to go through my cables now and replace with cat 6.
 So I bought the cable and some pass through connectors as I heard they were easier, None of the cables I made worked so I looked back at the advert for the tool and it says not compatible with cat 6, I&#x27;ve now read they are thicker with staggered connectors. Am I ok to carry on using the tool I have with cat 5e rj45 connectors but cat 6 cable as I don&#x27;t need the full 10gbs. I was just going to buy another crimping tool but most of the Amazon adverts say they are suitable for all sizes but how can they be if the Cat 6 ones are staggered 🤔 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi All,
 Got a customer in the process of migrating from their On-prem file server to SharePoint. They use Adobe Acrobat pretty extensively and would like to use the Adobe SharePoint online integration so they can save directly to SharePoint locations from Adobe. I&#x27;ve created a custom MSI installer with the Acrobat customisation wizard and got that working to enable the custom Adobe save and open experience.
 Wondering if there is a way to add SharePoint sites using this tool or a registry edit so that the SharePoint site file storage locations/accounts are preconfigured on install.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

 I&#x27;m currently leading a project in my mid-sized organization, where we&#x27;re undergoing a transition from Slack to Teams. The project was assigned to me recently, and we have a tight timeline of just 2 months to complete the transition. 
 However, the company has historically been resistant to change, and some executives have already expressed concerns about the switch. As a relatively new member of the company, I don&#x27;t have much experience with Slack, but I&#x27;ve been entrusted with leading this transition.
 While I believe that people just need time to adjust to the new system, I wanted to reach out to the community for advice. 
 Are there any important considerations or potential challenges I should be aware of during this transition period? My goal is to ensure a seamless migration and minimize any disruptions to our workflow.
 Additionally, I&#x27;m curious to learn about the similarities and differences in features between Teams and Slack. Are there any features that exist in both platforms? Furthermore, I&#x27;d greatly appreciate any insights into unique features offered by Slack that may not be available in Teams.
 Thank you in advance for your guidance and insights!

 Edit: server is IBM, not Lenovo. 
 I&#x27;m hoping that someone might be able to help point me in the direction of a solution because I&#x27;m stumped.
 Short background: I work in K-12 and our previous systems admin left for a new job a few months ago. His position was vacant (though his assignments were distributed across a few different people) until roughly a month ago when I was offered the spot. I am relatively inexperienced when it comes to server hardware and RAID configurations in practice, but I understand the theory. This was all understood by my senior leadership before they offered me this job and we all understand I am learning this through trial by fire. 
 The situation: Last week we get a work order from a remote site that users can&#x27;t access their site&#x27;s server. The …</span>

 In the output of who -a I see:
 pts/5  6650 id&#x3D;ts/5 term&#x3D;0 exit&#x3D;2
 When I look in /dev/pts I expected to see 5, but there is only 0 - 4 and ptmx.
 When I run fuser /dev/pts/5 the output is 6823, but every time I run this the number changes for the process so I can&#x27;t figure out which process is using pts/5.
 Here are my questions: - How do I figure out what process is using pts/5? - should I be concerned about this since it is mostly used with ssh or telnet.

                              <span>I worked for a company for eight years, reported to the CFO, and was promoted to Director of IT during that time. Then the company brought in a CIO and 3 months later I was let go because according to her I wasn&#x27;t on board with her plans. I had previously gone to HR stating that in those 3 months I had 3 meetings with her, was being cut out of all other meetings/planning, and had NO idea what was going on.
 I am now filling out an employment history for a new job and they want my previous supervisors contact info. Should I refer to the one that was my boss for 7+ years or the one for 3 months?
 Your opinions are appreciated.

                              <span>My ex boss was horrible. No one in the organization that I talked to liked him. One person on our team, maybe, because he got away with doing next to nothing.
 I don’t know the whole story but he resigned and we already have a replacement who’s sooo much better, more organized, more engaged, more communicative, more experienced… it’s like a night and day difference. 
 Now I feel the need to explain why shits all f’d up to the new boss. I sent him a list of job duties and started it with “I haven’t been able to do my actual job for 6+ months” because I’ve been forced to cover helpdesk and other areas that aren’t supposed to fall to me. I’m honestly embarrassed by the state of things.

                              <span>I work for a company with an IT team and a cloud operations team... the lines between both are pretty blurry.
 Is this common? - it just doesnt make much sense to me... I always think one team and having people specialise makes more sense... i.e. if an &quot;IT&quot; person can help with a cloud issue or a &quot;Cloud&quot; person can help with an IT issue.

 Create a MS Teams meeting for the time you want to be left alone and invite yourself.
 Join the meeting. It will just be you in the meeting, but to the rest of the world it will show you are on a call. A very “important” call.
 Take it a step further and screen share a random application window. Maybe just a Notepad with nothing on it.
 Your status will go into presenting mode thus indicating you are mega busy.
 Probably works for Zoom and stuff too. Using Cisco Jabber with presence enabled and also picks up that you are busy on a call.

                              <span>I&#x27;m getting onboarded to be the senior admin at a small company as the existing admin is set to retire soon. They sell software which basically consists of a desktop app (office workers) and a mobile app (field works) with a back end in SQL.
 Most all our customers are small as well without dedicated IT depts. So if a customer chooses, our company will host their SQL &amp; Web Server in a cloud VM, give it a public IP, and let the mobile app and desktop apps connect there rather than the customer hosting it themselves.
 Last week, I was being shown how we buy and license SQL for a new implementation. The guy showed me we get SQL standard and enough CALs to cover each office user, plus one CAL to cover every mobile user, because the app connects to a web server first, then to the SQL server, so SQL would never know that there&#x27;s multiple app users.
 Granted MS licensing is convoluted, but this is not how I understand CALs. Every mobile user, even though the app is connecting to a middleware, needs a CAL right? Yet this is how they&#x27;ve sold their software for the past few years.
 Not sure exactly what to do now that I&#x27;ve seen this? Bringing it to the attention of owners potentially puts a target on me as overstepping and being a threat to their business model? I&#x27;m not even sure how to bring something like this up. Usually big problems are things that are visible like failed hardware. Owners might say &quot;It works - I don&#x27;t see the issue&quot; and I don&#x27;t blame them - it&#x27;s hard to understand.
 Fixing it and just eating the license cost could be difficult given this company&#x27;s size. Re-quoting customers that have been live for years on our software telling them they&#x27;re not compliant seems equally impossible. Yet this is my living and I kinda need the company to do well so that I can do well. I feel like I&#x27;ve walked into a time bomb that was impossible to see from the outside.

They talk a good game but are lazy with failure to complete simple tasks fully, they constantly watch YouTube videos and suddenly minimise when I walk by but often too late so I can clearly see what they are up to and when I try to explain a task fully they constantly interrupt and don’t start talking about something totally irrelevant to the task. 
 It’s also coupled with 30 minute trips to the toilet that I cannot ignore as the bathroom is opposite my desk. 
 How would you deal with this individual, ideally I would like to replace them with someone who actually cares. 
 I have notified HR but need to gather a good approach to this too.

                              <span>Context: I&#x27;m a site leader with 20+ years of experience in the field. I’m working through a medium-complex unix script issue. I have gone DND on Teams to stop all the popups in the corner of my screen while I focus on the task. This is something I’m very capable of dealing with; I just need everyone to go away for 20 mins.
 Phone call comes through to the office.
 Manager: Hi, what’s the problem?
 Me: Sorry? Problem?
 Manager: Why have you gone DND on Teams?
 Me: I’m working through an issue and don’t need the constant pop ups. It&#x27;s distracting.
 Manager: Well you shouldn’t do that.
 Me: I’m sorry…
 Manager: I need to you to be available at all times.
 Me: I am available, I’m just busy.
 Manager: I don’t want anyone on DND. It looks bad.
 Me: What? It looks bad? For whom?
 Manager: For anyone that wants to contact you. Looks like you’re ignoring them.
 Me: Well at this moment in time I am ignoring them, I’m busy with this thing that needs fixing.
 Manager: Turn off DND. What if someone needs to contact you urgently?
 Me: Then they can phone me, like you’re doing now.
 Manager: … … just turn off DND.
 ... middle micro managers: desperate to know everyone&#x27;s business at any given moment just in case there&#x27;s something they don&#x27;t know about and they can weigh in with some non-relevant ideas. I bet this comes up in next weeks team meeting.

                              <span>Teams on Android is usually pretty stable and straightforward so it&#x27;s surprising to see this issue. Even MS support, from my continued discussions with them, is baffled.
 Essentially, we got a user reporting that he doesn&#x27;t have the option to select Bluetooth from the list of output devices. He just sees device and speaker. Issue started back in April.
 We can confirm the following with the user:
  
On a recent BYOD Android device -- Galaxy S22 Ultra running Android 13.
 We have no MDM in place to enforce a certain version of the app.
 Headset is a Sony WH-1000XM4.
 Can confirm the headset is detected and functional in other apps, e.g. YouTube, Audio Recorder, and Phones.
 Tried a cache clear through system settings and the Android settings itself.
 Tried a reinstall of Teams from the app store.
  
Not really sure why this would be happening and MS support feels the same way too.
 I&#x27;m thinking about having the user download an older version of Teams. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hi, all.
 So I&#x27;m new to cloud support and our workflow is mostly in managing the server of our clients. Sometimes, we have a new client and they want to migrate their files from their current server to their new server(where we set-up and manage).
 My question is what is the best scripting language to compare old files to new files. The software we use is filezilla and sometimes filezilla doesn&#x27;t fully transfer the files especially if it&#x27;s a folder within a folder. But the main thing here is what is a good scripting language to compare files (size disk) &amp; (contains) from old server to new. Because I checked the files manually and it&#x27;s taking much time. 
 Thank you everyone.

                              <span>SOLVED: Thanks, now I know it is a power issue with SFP.
 Hey folks,
 Quick question. Setting up some cabling (up to 45m of cable) which I plan to with two 10GbE NICs. Thinking of going with SFP+ slots for possible future fiber upgrade.
 Noticed something though: SFP+ modules seem to indicate a range limit, usually 30m or 80m max. Is this a SFP+ thing? Or do regular NICs have this too, but just don&#x27;t advertise it?
 It was my expectation that with a normal 10GbE RJ45 NIC and proper cat6a under 100 meters, 10GbE links could be established. Now I have doubts about that being a thing or just a theoretical limit which are not feasible with normal NICs (and them just working under 30m too or something similar).
 Any advice, insight or recommendations would be awesome.

                              <span>So we contracted an ISP to provide a layer 2 extension for part of our network.
 Essentially we VLAN 20, we have 6 hosts on it. The isp connects to that network and provides q in q to a remote site.
 I can see multicast (osp traffic) across their link. We can also see MACs across it. But it won&#x27;t support pinging a host across the network.
 I&#x27;ve been struggling to imagine what could be the issue. Best I&#x27;ve got is some kind of vlan issue in their network allowing layer 2 and BUM traffic but no unicast.
 We got them to finally attempt to test unicast rraffic after days of them saying it was our issue. Of course they weren&#x27;t able to pass unicast traffic either and are investigating where the issue is

                              <span>Hi r/networking!
 I&#x27;m a junior sysadmin/hobbyist working on a script and ansible suite for managing an automated lab infrastructure in a VMWare environment and am now looking for some input on E-W traffic design! (Preliminary note: As of current design, for any edge router 1-8 internal firewall &#x27;zones&#x27; can be implemented and any one internal firewall &#x27;zone&#x27; can be a mirrored DMZ of an internal zone. Any firewall in turn can manage 8 different portgroups connected to an arbitrary amount of hosts. All backdoor management is through an isolated private vlan.)
 In the first image I&#x27;ve connected the edge router to two portgroups, one for internal traffic and one for dmz traffic. Any firewall-router belonging to one of these two categories would be connected to one of these two portgroupps. https://snipboard.io/oSHWN5.jpg
 In the second image all firewall-routers have been isolated to their own portgroup, connected in turn to the edge-router. https://snipboard.io/oIU4r1.jpg
 My question is: What would be best practice with consideration of system internal traffic and separation of duties? Would you want the edge router to route internal east-west traffic if it delegated to different firewalls? Or would you want them on a shared &#x27;uplink&#x27; portgroup and subnet and do the east-west traffic by themselves? Spontaneously I&#x27;d say that the edge-router should primarily be concerned with North-South and internal traffic is to be managed on the internal firewalls, but then again, I have little to no experience. Would these be easier to manage as well rather than muddying the waters to have the firewalls do *some* firewalling in regards to internal EW traffic and the edge router do *some* of that as well?
 I appreciate any input and thanks for reading. :)

 Basically if you browse reddit and you have a plan of 8GB/mo - you use the alloted data. But if you browse facebook - you don&#x27;t use anything from your plan.
  
 It&#x27;s pretty stupid what they do considering social networks alongside youtube are largest bandwidth takers, but whatever. Are there any creative solutions to let&#x27;s say browse reddit this way?

 I would like toigrate my data from Helpscout to Freshdesk, and i found this website : https://help-desk-migration.com.
 But no pay to 4000 euros when I could do the same via integromat ( Make) and the right call.
 Is there someone that already done it and therefore would have kind of a list of the equivalents fields between freshdesk and helpscout by any chance ? 
 It would be amazing ! Thanks for your help !

 I have a user with an almost full mailbox, I’ve gone ahead and applied a retention policy to his mailbox to move his mail going forward. However I need to move mail from some large sub folders in his inbox to the In-Place Archive folder and break it up by a date range (2021,2022)etc..Does anyone have a good way to do this via powershell.

                              <span>Context: an email migration was done to Office 365(exchange online).
 I set up a user with the outlook mobile app on their phone. They report however that emails only start to populate in the outlook app on the phone after opening the outlook desktop app that is profiled on a machine we have for the user. I have not been able to see this in action. Initially I thought it might have been the focused view. Turned that off and confirmed that emails were no longer missing. However, the user is reporting this happening again. I checked exchange properties and confirmed active sync is enabled and even detects the phone that is set up. Just posting here in case I am missing something to check or if y’all have run into this before. My guess is that it’s something with the client(mobile phone) as I have set up other users on their mobile phones and similar reports have not been heard. Thanks in advance for any advice/commentary. Just a bit paranoid is all since it’s a very important user.

                              <span>I&#x27;m thinking about switching jobs and I&#x27;d like to understand where I stand in the marketplace.
 I&#x27;ve been working for 2.5 years (first tech job) as a &quot;Software Support Engineer&quot; at a small content management system company. We host a lot of clients&#x27; CMS applications and websites in our private clouds.
 My role entails daily work with clients who submit user knowledge tickets as well as report software issues with the CMS product and site implementations built by our developers. We do not have any tiered support so I handle whatever issue, regardless of complexity. I also do product QA, UAT and delivery, and very often spin up VMs for new client or internal development environments, set up websites and services, etc. (DNS, load balancer configurations, headers, VPNs, FTP, etc)

                              <span>With all this talk of &quot;outlook isn&#x27;t your ERP/CRM/file repository&quot;... 
 What is the right software for a 6-7 person project-based business? 
 We currently use a very small collection of sharepoint lists tied to a power-automate app to create template project folders/files in our teams/onedrive environment + project tracking using Microsoft Planner (all to varying levels of commitment to the digital system depending on the employee). Outlook basically handles all the rest of our customer interaction tracking.
 I have been casually looking at Odoo or Netsuite with the thought of doing a slow rollout myself starting with my projects and slowly rolling out to the other 5 employees. But this is so far down my list I wouldn&#x27;t even say its totally on my radar. 
 That being said, if outlook is moving toward this &quot;new&quot; view, with all of those features missing, this may move way up my priorities list.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve had an epiphany and realised that I want more from my career. I&#x27;m senior engineer for a small MSP and I&#x27;m going nowhere. Salary is poor and I just feel that I&#x27;m wasting my talents. I&#x27;m a great organiser and planner. I have good, broad technical knowledge and I&#x27;m a fast thinker and can come up with solutions to complex problems quickly.
 Trouble is I&#x27;m 56, but I don&#x27;t feel it and many people are surprised when the find out. I&#x27;m looking for IT Manager roles in a larger organisation. Would anyone even consider me at that age. I&#x27;m in Yorkshire, in the UK, if that helps.

                              <span>I work for an MSP, with my title being Jr SysAdmin. It’s a completely unearned title, given that most of my day to day is typical help desk shenanigans, but my position is unique in that 90% of the company does remote work, 9.9% does on-site onboarding/infrastructure building, and I’m part of the 0.1% (as in ~3 people) who works on-site full time for a client.
 Well, the client wants to end the contract. CTO is a paranoid fuck and never wanted to give the keys up to any of his systems for us to work with, one of the reasons I was told is because I’m not part of their ethnoreligious group, so I’m considered an “outsider”. Fine, whatever. But everyone else at the client loves me. I get great customer feedback, my metrics are great, and even my supervisors are always singing my praises because of all the on-site techs they’ve sent in the past, I’m the only one who’s stuck around and been consistently good at the job.
 So the contract is up June 30th, and my company informed me that they won’t be keeping me on past that. They’re going to let me go despite a perfect record. I’m assuming it’s because I make $60k a year for what’s basically a glorified help desk, but I digress. 
 I don’t know why I’m writing this to be honest, I’m just frustrated as hell. I’m a Marine Corps Reservist, so that makes finding a civilian job harder. This also comes right after I signed off on a new apartment, and I have 3 weeks worth of obligations family/military wise in August. Fucking wish I never did IT, this shit blows.

                              <span>Hey folks, I have over 5 years as a sysadmin at my current job and over 10 years in total experience, also have several certs.
 With all the layoffs happening right now, I&#x27;m wondering if its safer to stay at my current company or jump. I feel like its very possible we may have layoffs coming next year and I know a lot of companies do layoffs by &quot;last in first out&quot;
 I feel like if I jumped jobs I could make way more money (like a lot more, probably 50% more), but not sure if that would open me up to less stability. I live in LCOL so while more money would def be nice, I&#x27;m not dying or anything. I also work 100% remote and am not open to anything not 100% remote. I feel like there isn&#x27;t much room for advancement at current co, but the job is relatively chill most days and the benefits are good. Current co does offer decent severance also from what I&#x27;ve heard if layoffs did happen.
 I feel like I probably want to jump eventually but not sure if the timing is right. Would suck to change cos, then they announce massive layoffs and you&#x27;re the first to be let go, since they just hired you. Any advice would be appreciated!

 I have 1 dedicated Windows 2019 DHCP server on a intranet setup. Sometime yesterday, my DHCP server is being flooded with BAD_ADDRESS entries. My clients are connected via lan port and no wireless connectivity is enabled. 
 Have tried removing the BAD_ADDRESS entries but they keep coming back almost immediately after deletion. 
 What could be the possible cause?

                              <span>Hi all,
 We are experiencing issues with all the Macs that we updated to Ventura.
 Users are connecting via SMB (2.1 and 3.1.1) to our main fileserver (Server 2019) because we have a mixed Windows/Mac environment.
 This have been performed pretty well last years. But after upgrading several Macs to Ventura all the users with Ventura complaining about very poor performance with Quick preview. Sometimes it takes 20s to load a 20kb image. 
 Opening the file is not a problem and the image is loaded instantly, but the preview is not responding well.
 When the same users are working on our Archive server (Synology NAS) with SMB, they are having no issues.
 We even reinstalled several devices, but no luck. All the Monterey are not having any issues.
 I can’t find anything on the internet that may help resolve our issue. Hopefully someone here has the golden tip.

 My company is going to lay off people due to &quot;other companies are doing it, too&quot; amongst some other bullshit. I worked my ass off as a Sys Admin. Supporting 15+ apps, most without any training or good documentation. No promotion for me or my peers in years except people overseas (i work in the US). I&#x27;m brushing up my resume and started looking for another job. So, if/when i do get the boot what are some things to ask or do concerning the exit? Thank you in advance if i don&#x27;t get to reply to your comment.

                              <span>Hi,
 So for some reason a department thought it was a great idea to include a 4.8Mb .gif file in their mail signature. This results in their emails being huge and it is quickly becoming an issue (no big surprise)
 Obviously we will send out a mail telling everyone yo not use any sort of .gif or .webm in their mails. At least not as attachments.
  
 So my question is, is anyone blocking something like this? Would,it make sense to block .gif in mails if they are abive 250Kb or something? Any other suggestions.

                              <span>Greetings,
 One of the healthcare Mobile apps used by Doctors provides instant messaging and voice services and some clinical notifications via integration to or EHR servers. All servers (App and EHR) are located in our premises in the internal segment, and we publish one port (xmpp) to the internet where the mobile app connects to.
 When doctors are at home, the mobile app gets instant messages only, no voice capabilities are enabled over the internet, as this is a regulatory compliance thing. 
 On premise, as standard security practice, all doctors personal mobile devices are in guest WiFi vlan, isolated from the internal resources. There is a requirement to open up the guest Wi-Fi vlan to the mobile app servers in the internal segment to enable voice services. Now I’m totally against this, and the mobile app does support any MAM integrations, but would like to understand how admins deal with and secure access to similar business mobile apps.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m looking for a way to run containers simply like using Docker but safely using virtualization while keeping it performant as possible.
 I came across to two project that caught my attention:
 a) KataContainers
 b) Firecracker
 But I&#x27;m really confused about how they work, what are the differences and what is more performant. Would appreciate if anyone help me to clarify that.
 KataContainers looks simple. You can easily configure it as Docker container runtime. If I understand correctly, firecracker-containerd enables you to do the same as Kata, right? If so, what are the differences between them? What are pros and cons? In what cases should be one used over another? Which one is more performant?

 Right now were using telegraf and grafana, but I&#x27;m wondering if there are other solution out there.
 Some googling came up with Zabbix as a possibility.

                              <span>Several devices don’t even support it on the network so I’m making several MAC auth groups, then windows of course has to make my life hell by no passing over the windows credentials forcing end users the pop-up to authenticate and this is JUST TOOOOO MUCH for them…and the whole move to some devices only being azure joined is only adding to the complexity. Dang phones won’t renew their lease automatically when the re-auth period hits and have to be rebooted…I’m over it all.

                              <span>Hey all, I have recently been trying to dig myself out of the MSP space and into an internal position. I have recently been offered a job at a company where I would be the sole IT provider for location with 55+ people. Doing minimal server and Networking and help desk tickets.
 I currently work at MSP doing level two and three work. Maybe getting a promotion in the next year and was just approved for a pretty big raise. I&#x27;m not sure if this would be beneficial to my career so I was hoping to get some insight. 
 New job:
 Pros:
 * Not an MSP
 * 20k pay increase
 * Seems to be within my wheelhouse
 * Ownership of IT things ( Not MSP) 
 Cons:
 * Only IT for that office. No team or boss to bounce ideas off of. Not getting a great collaborative feeling from the remote IT team
 * Will be doing EVERYTHING. Powerpoints to network troubleshooting
 * Might be a step down technically speaking
 * No Work from home whatsoever. 
 Current job:
 Pros:
 * Job security
 * Great boss and team
 * I know what I&#x27;m doing, no learning curve.
 * Completely remote 
 Cons:
 * Overworked
 * Pay could be better
 * Feeling stagnant. 
 This would be the perfect position if I knew I had a good team and boss and had the chace to work from home some. I&#x27;m itching to get out of the MSP World and this is the first thing that&#x27;s come my way in a long time.

 If I simply create a new zone called &quot;potato.company.com&quot; and add &quot;test&quot; sub domain to it, Then potato.company.com stops working.
 What is the proper way of setting this up in windows dns server ?

Currently I have a lot of scripts on my laptop which I then manually enter the machine hostname for, and then enter the creds to authenticate on and I kinda want something a bit more streamlined

                              <span>I know this isn&#x27;t strictly &#x27;sysadmin&#x27;, but there is a wealth of knowledge of here so I thought I would get some input. 
 The practice that I work for has expressed a few times that it would be nice if I were to get certified as a PACS admin, and, when talking with their CEO he was speaking really highly of the PMP and said he would be willing to sign off on my hourly requirement. 
 For perspective, I have 2 years of experience. My sole goal is to make as much money as I can by being as valuable as I can, while also not working 90 hours a week. I&#x27;m not in it for me. I don&#x27;t need a new car or a nice watch. I just want to provide for my children. 
 Outside of &quot;depends what you are interested in&quot;, which direction would make me the most marketable/valuable?

                              <span>Really odd issue with a users Mac. Their microphone works for FaceTime, Teams, etc, but the second you answer a standard phone call on their Mac from their iPhone, the microphone doesn’t work. 
 I’ve verified that it has the proper mic selected, but can’t seem to solve issue. 
 Anyone else experienced this?

                              <span>So I work at a very small msp that is growing rapidly. We currently bill hourly but are transitioning into contracts. We are also kinda new to M365.
 Our Linux team has a ton of monitoring tools that greatly increased their efficiency and i was wondering if something like that exists for m365 based software. Both tenant wide and maybe service based? Like getting a warning when user A is nearly running out of space on outlook or user B uploading an ungodly amount of files to OneDrive or something like that. Do tools like that exist?

 Last year the response was &quot;We just need to figure where they fit into the team&quot;
 This year it was &quot;We are looking into it&quot; followed by &quot;We realise another member of staff is needed&quot; followed by &quot;The stats don&#x27;t support it&quot;.
 All patching is falling on me as well as DR&#x27;s, whilst getting complained at as an infrastructure engineer that the 1st line queue is a mess. I try to escalate stuff to my manager and get complained at that he is too busy. Team meetings are held after work finishes (well the couple we have had this year are).
 So after a two week holiday, I just decided enough was enough. Fired out my CV and it took me 2 weeks to find a job.

 HPE have an official Q&amp;A that says you can put a Gen9 in Gen8, but can&#x27;t find anything newer.

 Building manual, scheduled alerts on Splunk, I don&#x27;t feel very confident I&#x27;ve covered all possible attack scenarios.
 An NDR with its dynamic, real time alerts seems the perfect missing piece. (We already have EDR, email security, proxy etc)
 My only question is, does an NDR actually give you a peace of mind that it will block any possible malicious network activity?
 Has it been an added value for you?

 I have a 2-server PKI environment, with an offline root CA and one subordinate/issuing intermediate CA. I am trying to request a certificate from one of my template in the issuing CA, however I keep getting an error &quot; The certificate request could not be submitted to the certification authority&quot;. RPC server is unavailable.
 I&#x27;ve turned of firewall on the server and the CA server for tests, but requests still failing. 
 Any clues how I can resolve this?

 I found an online course for the a+ cert. Its 92 lectures and it would take a bit to sit through though it’s only 15 dollars. I don’t know if it’s worth the time or to try and get a interview now without any certs.

 voila you are no longer easy to fireable -not that you want to be the only one that knows it all because you can still share the skills with others/teach them.

                              <span>Background: I administer a simple Active Directory domain where all joined computers run Windows Server 2012r2, and the domain includes a database running SQL Server 2014.
 I changed a domain-wide GPO from a “never” account lockout threshold to “3 invalid login attempts” in Computer Config\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies. 
 A few hours after pushing the new account lockout policy, our developer discovered that a SQL Server Login (not a Windows/domain user) was unable to authenticate via SSMS or other methods (connection strings, etc). after multiple attempts with an incorrect password. Error Log for MSSQLSERVER said Event ID 18456: Login failed for ‘redacted’. Reason: “The account is currently locked out. The system administrator can unlock it.”
 The SQL Login lockouts stopped happening after I reverted the GPO to a “never” lockout threshold.
 QUESTION: Is it possible that the domain GPO account lockout policy is responsible for locking that SQL login?
 I assumed that the GPO only acted on domain users, but all the evidence suggests that’s either exactly what happened, or that’s one heck of a coincidence.
 Maybe if a policy is applied to Domain Computers, it also applies to the Database Server and therefore to SQL logins? Doesn’t sound right… but I’m at a loss!
 Happy to clarify or add any additional info I might’ve forgotten. 
 Any insight would be tremendously appreciated, as my boss insists I understand exactly why this happens, and I desperately want to. thank you!

 I am a System Engineer 3 currently. Our new director that took over a few months back has decided to move me to Cybersecurity Analyst position, since we do not have a security group. He wants me to build up the security group but I told him I believe going from an engineer to analyst would be a demotion. He said pay and everything stays the same but its not sitting right with me. Is it just me over thinking this is a demotion?

                              <span>Hello, fellow Redditors.
 We&#x27;re currently facing some challenges with our large-scale mixed deployment of Switches and Wireless Access Points from Cisco and Aruba, and I&#x27;m hoping to gather some valuable insights and suggestions from the community.
 Our network infrastructure consists of both Cisco and Aruba devices, and the main difficulties we&#x27;re encountering are as follows:
  
Different UI: Managing the network becomes a bit of a hassle due to the varying UIs. Aruba uses Airwave, while Cisco relies on DNAC. This disparity in UIs makes it time-consuming for us to navigate and configure both platforms efficiently. 
 Lack of Central Management and Monitoring: We&#x27;re struggling with the absence of a centralized solution for managing and monitoring devices across both platforms. It would be ideal to have a single management system that allows us to seamlessly control and monitor both Cisco and Aruba devices.
 Single NAC Solution: We&#x27;re in need of a Network Access Control (NAC) solution that is compatible with both Cisco and Aruba devices. This NAC solution should be fully functional and comply with standards such as RADIUS and TACACS+. Specifically, we&#x27;re looking for features like MAC profiling for dynamic MAC registration, BYOD portals, and guest portals. Additionally, it should support both wired and wireless 802.1x authentication and provide administrative authentication for Aruba and Cisco devices.
  
Open to any suggestions or recommendations that can help us address these challenges. If you have faced similar situations or successfully integrated Cisco and Aruba devices in a mixed deployment, your expertise would be greatly appreciated!
 Please share your experiences, or any solutions you might know of that could help us overcome these issues. Thank you in advance.

                              <span>For the second time in about 8 years of running a pair of LTM VEs under ESXi (vsphere cluster with Dell M640s, all dual-attached 10GE ports on VDS), I had one LTM VE &quot;lose&quot; its control plane but the data plane was still forwarding packets. The peer noticed the first one wasn&#x27;t sending heartbeats, so it tried to acquire the resources and tell the first one to release resources. The first one stayed online, and the result was both were stealing each other&#x27;s TCP sessions, causing random session resets, until I forcibly rebooted the first LTM VE node.
 This could have been prevented if the TMOS supported either sending a &#x27;power off the peer&#x27; command to VCSA, or if the ESXi/LTM-VE combination was capable of having a watchdog configured, where the hypervisor would reset the VM if it failed to receive any watchdog heartbeats after some period of time.
 Are either of these possible? We&#x27;re running TMOS 15.1.x, but can upgrade to 16.x if we need to.

                              <span>(Sorry if this is not relevant to this sub-reddit). I want to simulate a network with N number of nodes, could be Ubuntu or any VM that are connected (virtually of course) and have some open-source routing daemon running on them (I am thinking FRR ?) that supports BGP. I would then like the nodes to advertise their loopback IPs to the other nodes (could be all eBGP sessions) and then, say a head VM that can monitor these BGP sessions on all nodes every hour or so to make sure the sessions are all in Established state. I wouldnt want to use simulators like NS-3 or so and wanted to create the VMs and the connections between them on my own. Any suggestions if this is possible and where I should start looking from? Since I wouldn&#x27;t need GUI for controlling these VMs, I am thinking using something like kvm to launch multiple VMs on my laptop and then take it from there? Also for the open-source routing daemon, does FRR sound good? Thanks

                              <span>What do you think about firewalls like pfSense and OPESense, now that NGFWs extist? They are way cheaper, compared to Fortigate and Cisco; which makes them quite attractive for a small business that just needs a solid firewall with VPN support- and without a lot of money for networking equipment... With that being said, the firewall will be protecting pretty much all the company &quot;value&quot;, represented in a couple of source control servers.

                              <span>Given a setup like this: snipboard.io/TrJVaH.jpg
 In the first step, let&#x27;s assume two separate DSL lines going into two separate routers (VyOS machines). Both DSL lines provide public WAN IP via DHCP. VyOS boxes are configured to use NAT. On the inside VRRP is used for router redundancy.
 Now my concern is is NAT and its connection tracking. When a router handover occurs, all the connections will slowly have to time out (I believe). Is this the best that one can do?
 Now here is VRRP connection tracking sync. But I don&#x27;t see how this would help since both boxes have a different WAN address. So even if all connection tracking is synced, responses from the internet will fail on handover because responses are sent to the old WAN address.
 ​
 The only way how I see this working if the internet somehow sees the same WAN for both routers. How can this work?
 Question 1: Let&#x27;s assume we have no own IP network but only the two dynamically assigned WAN addresses by the two ISP. Is the sketched setup (without connection-tracking sync) the best that can be done?
 ​
 Question 2: Suppose we do have a /24 that is routed by the two ISPs. Now the public IPs are, say, 192.0.2.100 and 192.168.0.2.101 respectively. How would would one build a redundant router for an internal NAT network with that config? 
 The only way I can see this working is assigning the same public IP to the VyOS machine (some sort of &quot;multicast&quot;) but that&#x27;s of course not permissible. Or add another box in front of the two VyOS routers that performs NAT. But then there&#x27;s again a single point of failure and no point in having redundant routers behind it.

                              <span>Okay, so I was always the guy who told everybody that SA Lifetimes should match on both sides of IPSec tunnel.
 That was until last week when I was troubleshooting periodic downtimes on a tunnel that I just moved from ASA to our new Palo Alto. Remote side is a Virtual Private Gateway in our contractor&#x27;s AWS VPC.
 They were occuring at random times when rekeying Phase 2 SA.
 Sometimes the tunnel was up for two days and then suddenly dropped. Sometimes it dropped after just 3 hours. (Phase 1 - 8 Hours, Phase 2 - 1 Hour)
 The worst thing was that only Phase 2 SA went down and the AWS endpoint wasn&#x27;t able to deal with that so it always meant that nothing could pass through the tunnel until the IKE SA expired or until I cleared the SAs manually.
 Finally I got some time to troubleshoot and enabled debugs on PA. I also requested logs from the guy operating the AWS infrastructure (not a networking guy).
 After I had a look at these logs, I figured out that sometimes it would occur that we started rekeying the Phase 2 SA at the same time which eventually caused the new and the old SA to get deleted on PA.
 I ended up changing the P2 SA Lifetime so it&#x27;s longer than configured lifetime on the other side and I have no problems since because only one side initiates the rekey now...
 Never stop learning...

                              <span>Some background on me. I am currently a senior network engineer with a few years of experience and have CCNA, Sec+ and JNCIA certs. Also I am in the northern Virginia/ DC Area. 
 So my question is would it be more beneficial for me to spend the next couple years continuing to work my way up to the CCIE or do a masters degree ? The program I am looking at is a Masters of Telecommunications at George Mason University. My alternate plan is to just knock out a masters degree at WGU in 6 months and then quickly return to working on certs again. 
 Any input in appreciated. Thanks in advance!

However, we found that the speed of Apple Devices(iOS/MacOS) is extremely slow, around 10 Mbps. The speed is normal in WPA3-128 and the CPU and RAM usage on AP is quite normal. Has anyone tested WPA3 on CNSA or 256? Thanks

 Hello All,
 The company that I work for has acquired a new MPLS Circuit from AT&amp;T at both our Primary and DR DCs that have been active for a few weeks now. Our Primary DC is hosted at a colocation and our DR is hosted in Azure and is connected via Netbond. Yesterday, we received a new MPLS Circuit also from AT&amp;T for one of our larger branch offices. This would now make a total of three CERs that are running on this new MPLS VPN from AT&amp;T (Primary DC CER, Azure ER, and Remote Office CER).
 Both DCs and Remote Office MPLS Circuits are l…</span>

                              <span>Hi so as the title says I&#x27;m looking for an android tablet with a stylus... as a network engineer, more and more if finding I have to make diagrams in Visio. The main problem is that I have is that i just get verbally told on what someone wants or if I&#x27;m trying to trouble shoot I like to normally draw the flow out on paper. So I&#x27;m looking to use it to make those initial diagrams I can sit with someone to get the &quot;cigarette packet&quot; drawing before making it look professional in Visio. Also I&#x27;ll be using it to take notes from meetings and learning new subjects etc... The only game I would play on it is something like RuneScape 3 (Yes I&#x27;m still a kid at heart :D)
 I was hoping the Pixel Tablet would be a good option but since I&#x27;m UK based I feel like the £599 price tag compared to the $499 US price tag is kinda a **** take... Also I dont want the stand thing.
 I am now Looking at the OnePlus Pad with the Stylo Pen which would come to £550.
 So Question is the OnePlus a good option or is there something else I should be looking at? (No Apple Please...)

 This is CAT6A F/UTP cable between the same two locations (patch panel  double outlet). A PoE switch is on one end and an AP is at the other end. 
 On the first link (333-1), the AP powers up but links at 10Mbps, on the second port it links up fine at 1Gbps.
 I know this probably means the pair 3/6,7/8 are busted, but why did it still PASS a fluke test?
 Is there any docs to learn how to interpret these results in general?

                              <span>I have 2 Servers (Domain Controllers) located on the different VLANs and Subnets but on the same site so they are basically behind the same firewall but seperated with VLANs.
 Host A pings Host B while Host B pings Host A.
 The result of Host A is Avg 0ms while the result of Host B is Avg 89ms tested with 20 pings.
 The Servers are virtualized in vsphere on 2 different hosts and the vsphere environment is connected to the bladecenter while the bladecenter is connected to vc switch which is connected to the 2 core switches. The Core switches are connected each to a firewall in active/passive mode where the VLAN of the 2 Servers terminates. The 2 physical ESX hosts are on different switch. Physical ESX Host A is connected to Core Switch 1 while physical ESX Host is connected to Core Switch 2. The Core Switches are connected with a Trunk Port of 2x 40 Gbit/s.
 The ping was executed in the same time on each host.
 Can someone explain what could be wrong here?

                              <span>VPN to which I connect to is in US and I am in EU. I connect to VM over remote desktop and connection is stable but slow. My router is connected to 4G internet and I was thinking of trying to connect a phone to USB tethering and use two internet connections for load balancing. Can load balancing router feature increase VPN speed?

                              <span>Hey folks,
 I work at Faang company as an NDE , I have been in an ops team since one year and have absolutely not liked it since day 1 , I wanted to work more on larger scale design and architecture, my manager said that it would come as we go on so I rolled up my sleeves and delivered as much as I could , I got an exceeded expectations rating and very good reputation , but I don’t like doing 90% what I do , it’s been a year now so I had a discussion with my skip and he told me he could move me to the engineering team as soon as hiring freeze is over , but that could take a year or more I have no guarantee ,I don’t want to stay in ops anymore I have the opportunity to make a lateral move to another team in the org that is a mix of networking, cloud and automation but I am afraid ( I think it’s FOMO) that if I move I would blow my chance of ever being in the engineering team, what are you guys thoughts and advice on this ?

While some schools are calling for censorship and content warnings, others are fighting the progressive notion that speech can be violence.  We speak with an education expert about the state of free speech on college campuses.

                              <span>Greetings, wizards of r/cisco! Buckle up, because we&#x27;re about to embark on an epic, slightly tongue-in-cheek journey through the wilderness of Cisco networking solutions. Brace yourselves, because it&#x27;s Traditional Cisco vs. Meraki.
 Round 1: Setup &amp; Ease of Use
 Traditional Cisco solutions are like those massive Lego sets with a gazillion pieces. They are fun (if you&#x27;re into that sort of thing), flexible, and the outcome can be magnificent. But you&#x27;ll need an entire weekend, a big table, and maybe a magnifying glass.
 On the other hand, Meraki is like your friendly IKEA furniture set. Open the box, follow the colorful, wordless instructions, and voila! You&#x27;ve got a bookcase... or was it a table? Either way, it was easy, right? That&#x27;s Meraki for you.

                              <span>Running a small operation here, with a couple of stacked Dell S4810&#x27;s as our core switches.
 To modernize things a bit, I got a quote for Arista 7280SR3-48YC8 for about $25K a pop. But it looks like I can easily get a refurb Dell S5148F-ON for a tiny fraction of the cost. I was frankly surprised that the used price has come down this low, when new units from these vendors still easily fetch in the high $10K&#x27;s and beyond, with huge lead times.
 Am I missing something here? It&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m asking to compare Arista and Netgear… :)

                              <span>Next month, I and a couple colleagues will be on a media job out of town where lots of our work (editing) will be done in our own hotel room. Our network setup usually involves a subnet which gets its internet connection through hotel rooms&#x27; wired ethernet jacks. (The subnet is for a network drive). However, this hotel we are staying in particular has no wired ethernet ports in its rooms, only (good) Wi-Fi through a seemingly well-installed Ruckus AP system. Speeds are already solid and in the hundreds of megabits. No captive portals. I know all of this because I was there a few months ago.
 I&#x27;m looking to experiment and create my own sub-network that obtains its internet uplink wirelessly from the hotel&#x27;s Wi-Fi network. The machines don&#x27;t have Wi-Fi capability, so I&#x27;d rather try first to accomplish internet uplink on the subnet level. Of course this would involve a device that can connect to the hotel&#x27;s SSID and act as a wireless-to-wired bridge. The first device that comes to mind would be a wireless repeater, but to me that sounds cheap. Would that work? Does the Unifi line support this? Or is there other hardware that can do this?
 Thank you.

                              <span>Had a lot of udld issues recently, some which only take one uplink down but others that take both links down. Results in needing to physical go around and console or reboot switches to get them back online.
 These issues occur during some distro switch upgrades or the other day when we had a switch have a bug. So no true lasting unidirectional links.
 Would like to have autorecovery of the errdisabled state but concerned about any potential impact of a udld event that lasts more than a few minutes and results in bringing a unidirectionally link online and it causing a problem before the udld timers shut it down.
 Using rpvst which usually converges in a few seconds but my understanding is that since both sides cannot detect bpdu that it would revert to basic stp timers of 30-50 seconds. Any downsides to bringing a unidrectional link back up with recovery? Would spanning tree timers prevent an actual issue?

I&#x27;m looking for old downloads of Cumulus Linux, or Switch Light Configuration examples (I assume I just have it mis-configured to not route traffic).
 Does anyone have a download location for the arm Cumulus Linux 2.x NOS or advice on getting Switch Light OS to route traffic between the ports? (Admin Interface/SSH works fine, just not the SFP+ ports)

                              <span>I need to design a flyaway rack that is going to highly remote locations to support up to 35 work stations (predominantly on wifi). I want to deploy 4 starlink dishes (we have the business dish) and combine them into one switch which has a number of APS on them.
 My main sticking point is what I use to load balance the 4 starlink networks. I have not got any experience doing this and need some advice on hardware solutions for this.
 Thanks
 Edit - I so far have:
 Starlink, Dream Machine Pro, 4 APS, Ups.
 All is configured and works well, I just need to add more network capacity and we have calculated that 3-4 Starlinks will do the trick.

 the 25G link between Core Stack C9500 and hypeflex node HX220C-M6S did not come up . The 25GBASE Cable 3 is totally working. I have checked the ports from Hyperflex and C9500 , everything is fine.
 I May have read somowhere that this issue is related to FEC config . Both ports need to be on cl74. I appreciate if you can help me. 
 Thanks

                              <span>I set up 2 CRS305 switches a few years ago and I recall testing file transfers then and I was getting 800-900MBs with large VM files.
 Not sure if it was the cause but a few weeks ago I upgraded to the newest RouterOS firmware.
 While still in the RouterOS I also upgraded the RouterBOARD fireware to 6.49.7.
 I&#x27;ve tried switching to the switch SwOS and updated the SwOS version to 2.13 but it did not help.
 Not sure if it means anything but the main switch got stuck a few times when switching to the SwOS. Power cycle did not work. I had the same IP address in both configs but ended up using the reset button after the power was back. It did the same thing when trying to update the SwOS firmware. ???
 I have a simple setup with a few workstations and a laptop. They have very fast SSDs that can copy to each other in the same workstation at around 4-5GBs and to themselves at around 1-2GBs.
 I used the /int bridge port print command and all the ports have HW hardware on.
 __________________________________
 I&#x27;ve looked at it a bit more and with workstation1, workstation2 and the laptop all on the same CRS305 switch. Both WS1 and the Laptop get 1.00-1.02GBs and the Windows file copy graph looks flat with only very small dips. Looks really good. But if I copy from the WS1 to the Laptop or the Laptop to WS1 I get around 400-500MBs and it&#x27;s all over the place.
 WS1 and the Laptop are using Ethernet ports and Ethernet SFP modules on the CRS305 switch. WS2 has Fiber SFP modules. Not sure if that matters.
 ​
 Here is a video copying first on the laptop in the RDP window from WS2, then on WS1 from WS2.
 Then from WS1 to the Laptop and then from the laptop to WS1. The last one, laptop to WS1 is always the slowest to start, it goes up slowly.
 I just don&#x27;t get how/why copying from WS2 is rock solid on both but then between WS1 and the laptop is so bad.
 All three PCs have SSDs that can read and write over 3GBs.

                              <span>I’ve been in networking for almost a decade now. I still enjoy it but what gets me is how much specialized our work is. By that I mean you’re pretty much bound to the brands your company has. You’re going to be a Cisco guy or a checkpoint guy, etc. it’s just frustrating to keep up w these things, and worse if it gets replaced and you sort of start all over again and learn how this “new” tech is implemented differently 
 I guess my question is, what would be a worthwhile networking career path that’s the most vendor agnostic? I’m thinking python/automation but I’m not really up to date w what else is out there.

 We will be using only one router/firewall, 15 switches distributed in 11 racks (a few stacked switches), 80 APs... Do we need OSPF? And as for PIM, we might be using multicast for the video surveillance system...
 No linked sites.... From another thread:
  
OSPF will make sense only if you have 2 links to and from the site. Even then I would recommend making it a totally stub site just to optimise the routing table.
  
Your thoughts?

 I have a switch (DCN S5750E-26X-SI). On one port I receive 10 vlans.
 Now, depending on MAC inside each of those vlans I need to put this MAC in vlan 3 or 4.
 From what I read, for MAC-based vlan input needs to be untagged.
 Is my only option to bridge those 10 vlans (I don&#x27;t need them separate, I just receive them like that form outside) then put this bridge on access an loop it to another port with MAC-based VLAN enabled?

                              <span>Hi,
 Looking for a direction to make a self organizing network that can handle dynamic multiple gateways.
 Imagine when a group of friends get together their phones would talk, confirm which has the best 5G service and all use that.
 or If no 5G, the next best available.
 and if one of them has run out of data for the month, can use any of their connection.
 (yes, ignoring security and all that. these would all be sharing on purpose and with full knowledge of the owners/users/etc/etc)
 I don&#x27;t imagine phones being able to do it, but is there a routing protocol that can handle dynamic gateway selection along with path selection?
 Thanks!

                              <span>As someone who passed batchelor of computer application, ive planned to take courses related to networking, courses like CCNA,CCNP,CCIE etc. During my studies ive found out that im more into technical aspects than coding. That made me chose this field. But enquring some people i know in this field told me to take some other courses related to cloud networking/computing since the field is moving more towards cloud based. The courses that they have suggested me are cyber security courses and cloud computing courses. As someone who just turned 25, i dont wish to spend another 3 years and land a job after 5 years. Really confused and scared of wasting time. What would be your suggestion? Is getting a CCIE certification would land a job? Is it future proof?

                              <span>Hey all, i&#x27;m volunteering to put together a POS system for a yearly neighborhood outdoor event and looking for advice on wifi there. The area I&#x27;m working with is about 200 feet and on the edge of it one of the businesses has volunteered their internet connection.
 Last year there were problems with connectivity, people are made of meat and water and the signal wouldn&#x27;t reach well during peak hours. Also there are just enough people that cell signals get jammed up, so it looks like a hotspot is out. We want to make sure that the square readers stay working. 
 Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m thinking: I have a Linkstar I&#x27;ve been messing around with for shit and grins. Get a cheap point to point pair of antennas to go from the building with internet to a high spot above the beer garden and into to the linkstar. From there get a few fire tablets, reflash the firmware to get rid of the ads, and boom. 
 This is all on a budget, I&#x27;ll probably go out of pocket on it since it&#x27;s a non-profit thing. Is this the right way to go about this?

                              <span>What are your thoughts on what makes a good network document? How about a good diagram? What makes you look at a document and be like &quot;damn THAT&#x27;s a good document. I want my docs to look like that.&quot;
 Any standard outline you follow? How much detail do you put in versus assume that the reader should know the information?
 I&#x27;m in a very sad situation where I am forced to use power point as a technical knowledge dissemination tool, whereas a technical white paper would be more appropriate delivery mechanism. There&#x27;s just too much information to fit into the slides, and the people reviewing these slides are not all network engineers/architects. (I normally write with markdown and asciidoc and convert to PDF)
 I&#x27;ve brought this matter up with the management, but they insist on using power point. It&#x27;s like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole.
 I&#x27;ve tried to scope the slides, by stating which slides are primarily intended for a more technical audience versus just a general one, however the problem is less-technical management loves to interject with their questions when they come across content they don&#x27;t understand.
 Others want to just take my slide deck, be able to look at some bullet points and get a basic idea, yet still be briefed on finer details of a design. It&#x27;s hard to find a balance.
 To me, power point is a visual aide for me to deliver a presentation, and a guide on where to get more detailed information. Not a zero to hero manual.

                              <span>Hey all, solo IT jack of all trades here. I&#x27;ve got a couple users who demand using a Macbook and therefore have to use Parallels if they want to be able to still access some of the applications used at our business. For some users, the only application they need from Windows is actually a RemoteApp from a third party company application that is only supported/installed on Windows. We do not own or manage this server. I don&#x27;t have admin access to the server and the remote company claims that there is no way for the RemoteApp to work on the Mac despite Microsoft having support for RemoteApps with their MacOS Remote Desktop App. In fact, I can even RDP into the server (but our accounts don&#x27;t have desktop access so they disconnect immediately), and if I setup a remote app with the info I have about their server I can see/list the RemoteApps but when I attempt to launch them I get Error code 0x104 (Unable to connect).
 ​
 I actually still have full access to an older server that we used to use RemoteApp with, so I might be able to learn something by looking at it.
 ​
 TLDR: Company claims their &#x27;custom&#x27; RemoteApp won&#x27;t work on the Mac even though it&#x27;s a glorified RDP connection. I say no but am not sure where to start. I have the RDP user credentials, server IP, and app name. I may be able to deduce the server filepath to the application as well.

                              <span>I&#x27;m at the end of my rope here and wanted to see if anyone would be willing to help me troubleshoot this very strange issue we are seeing in our environment.
 Background
 I help administer a hybrid environment with both on-prem AD and AAD. We also use GCDS to sync user profiles over to google for gmail and other google apps. Staff use MS SAML SSO for authentication with google.
 After the schooldude f* up we instructed users who had been affected to use a self-service password reset link that had been implemented years ago. This link goes to our internal ADFS server and resets their password in our local AD.
 Suspected Cause
 After the password reset some of these users have found their chromium profile broken. I say chromium because the issues persist in both Chrome and Edge despite all o…</span>

                              <span>Hi, 
 I manaeg a network of abiout 50vms (primarily an RDS farm) on a Hyper-V cluster. The network is physically isolated from our workstation netowork. My access is via RDP to management VM with RSAT installed or console login via RMM tools. Where possible all tasks are performed from the RSAT either via GUI or Powershell remoting. 
 ​
 I am trying to get my head around the best way to manage accounts when its primarly just me (and one other to help when i am away). 
 I currently just login to any machine with my DA account and dont use the web for anything. I have a non da account that i use if i need to access the RDS farm as a user and peform non DA tasks (using the software we host in the farm) 
 ​
  
Should i be logging in to servers as a local admin user only? 
 Log into RSAT as a standard user and always use &quot;runas&quot; to lauch managment tools. 
 Should i have more than one &quot;Admin&quot; account? RDS admin, Hyper-V admin, FileServer admin etc? 
  
I get on teams to only give permnission to perform the tasks required etc. I find it harder to work out thge balance of security and practicality for a single SysAdmin

Something I have always struggled with was the process of rotating the password for the service accounts that we use in IIS. 
 You may ask, why don&#x27;t you just use app-passthrough? Some apps and vdirs use a UNC path to a share for their home directories and app passthrough won&#x27;t work for not only those, but for the parents of those vdirs and apps.
 Our IIS configs have several root/parent apps and under those we have about a three dozen child apps and vdirs. About a half dozen app pools to silo worker processes for different apps and sites (balancing between performance and isolated memory space). After my efforts to script this proved futile, I searched the internet…</span>

 Call comes in from a director of a client today saying her computer “was doing funny things”. Conversation progressed and we were told paragraphs disappeared from a word document and then emails started being deleted from her inbox. 
 Our initial response was to quarantine the machine, see if there was anything odd flagged in EDR or firewall and then proceed from there. Couldn’t find anything. 
 Turns out she dropped some of her lunch in her keyboard and the delete key got stuck down.
 Happy Friday!

 User was having a problem with their dock today, so I asked them on Teams, “please send me a picture of your dick”
 Didn’t hear back for a few hours, but noticed the user is still online. Went back and looked at the message I sent…
 I’m not sure what happens now, but I think I’m either getting into a relationship, or getting fired and sued. 
 Definitely Friday.

                              <span>My company does not do remote so I am in the office daily. This is first job in 20 years that has a strict dress code. I was saving so much money before. Shirt/tie M-Th and no ties Friday. 
 You guys have any favorite brand shirt and do you guys wear short sleeve dress shirt. I find that a bit weird looking aka Dwight from the office. 
 No polo till June - august.

 Any ideas?

They insert their smart card and no certificates are pulled into the local store so nothing works. But if they go to ANY other computer and insert their smart card the certs show up and they are able to use it. 
 I&#x27;ve checked the Certificate Propagation service and its running correctly (to my knowledge). Kind of at a loss on how to continue troubleshooting this since there seems to be no errors associated with it that I&#x27;ve found. Has anyone ran into this problem?

                              <span>Hello fellow Redditors,
 I wanted to start a discussion on the topic of whether customers need Web Application Firewalls to protect their Web (SaaS) applications. We are large educational institution
 I understand with SaaS model, the responsibility for securing the underlying infrastructure and platform lies with the service provider, while the customer is responsible for securing their own data and access.
 But sometimes customer needs to put additional security measures such as WAF to prevent from threats like DDoS attacks.
 I&#x27;d love to hear your thoughts and experiences regarding this topic What do you to protect Web SaaS apps.

                              <span>Was working as a Jr. SysAdmin for two years at a small insurance firm and just started a new gig as a SysAdmin L3 at a commercial bank in my state. I’ve almost been here a month and just starting to feel comfortable for the most part.
 I was brought on to replace the current L3 as he will be leaving for a government gig, was told he wouldn’t be leaving until the Fall so we can work together to transfer knowledge and responsibilities.
 We found out yesterday he is actually leaving for the new gig in a little less than 2 WEEKS. I got 5 projects that haven’t even really been started yet dropped on me and a bunch of meetings to follow them up. I was already still getting used to the environment and now this has just put me in a very anxious spot, feeling imposter syndrome hardcore now.
 Any advice from people in this position before?

                              <span>So Adobe Acrobat Pro license cost for business jumped from around $16.99 to $23.99 USD.
 That is a $8 USD bump.
 Which is an approximate 41% price increase.
 Of course trying to pay for an annual license yields no discount either.
 To justify the increase, they said this:
 *Why is the price increasing? Adobe Acrobat Pro has improved significantly over the last few years with the addition of many new features, including:
 Liquid mode, which automatically reformats text, images, and tables for quick navigation and consumption on small screens.
 Integrations with Google Suite, Box, and Microsoft that enable customers to collaborate and make changes to PDFs directly from Microsoft Teams.
 Expansion to new surfaces that allow customers to access our PDF tools on the web and mobile.
 New e-signature features that streamline workflows and eliminate the need for in-person and “wet” signatures that can slow business down.*
 Reason 1 and 3 should not have been used as a reason. That is like saying, we changed the template on our website to HTML5 and it should look okay now on your phone.
 So at what point does the price gouging stop? It seems like were being charged for common updates.
 The e-signatures, I can understand. Fighting DocuSign. DocuSign can lick my butt. But something tells me this will be removed in the future from the Pro license and used as an add-on service. Like the way Microsoft tells you, any person can call in to your Teams meeting. But you need a conference bridge, and only after you pay for the conference license of $2.50 per user. That pools your minutes together. Which can be chewed up by just a single user who mistakenly uses the call me at this number feature.

                              <span>Hi all,
 hoping someone might be able to offer some advice....
 we are looking at standardising our Windows 10 start menu, nothing major, just certain apps pinned to start under folders. This works fine.
 If we then follow M$&#x27; guide on adding the taskbar layout to the same xml file, it breaks the startmenu layout and ignores the taskbar changes.
 if we take the taskbar section out, all works again as it should.
 using GPO, we copy the layoutmodification.xml to the default user profile, and also to a local folder (c:\scripts), without the taskbar settings it works fine, but with them in it all stops working, so new users get a startmenu with no items pinned and the default taskbar.
 ​

 the XML file with the taskbar settings, looks like this

                              <span>I just started as the local IT support for a medium-sized manufacturer. Their environment has no structure that I can see, or at least it&#x27;s very limited (a few VLANS and a domain). I&#x27;m new to running the show, and I would greatly appreciate any advice on where to begin to try to get this place in order.
 Most of the machines are on Windows 11 right now, with some of the servers on 2012 and some I&#x27;m not even sure of. We have a handful of legacy applications which require some *really* old software to run, and I&#x27;m hoping to sandbox all of that in a VM eventually.
 We have multiple different backup solutions, some of them local and some of them are cloud-based. All of that is automated already.
 I&#x27;m working on a hardware inventory, as what we had was woefully inadequate and so I&#x27;m not actually 100% certain of what&#x27;s present beyond what I can walk around and see.
 Our server room is unsecured; Anyone can just walk right in with no fob and no swipe.
 We do have a corporate help desk from the company that purchased this location, but they primarily just manage purchasing decisions and provisioning.
 So, again, in terms of where to begin, right now I have my eyes firmly on the security of our server room and the hardware inventory, followed by getting hosts on some kind of naming convention and then the same for users... I&#x27;m sure there are a hundred more important things I could and should be thinking about, so please do feel free to shout at me what you think those are.
 ​
 Thank you!

                              <span>I made a simple suggestion to a professor regarding the lack of modules that cover servers / potentially systems administration, and to my surprise it was turned into an actual third year undergraduate module at my university.
 This module will be taught over a ten week period with a one-hour lecture per week, switching to a more practical format later in the term. The professor is quite familiar with Linux and distributed computing, but is currently still outlining the module and taking suggestions;
 This is a final year module in a bachelors degree in computer science, and students should be somewhat familiar with Linux by this point. What type of content would you recommend in a module like this?

There&#x27;s also a great deal of content out there that violates our advertising/promotion rule, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos.
 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

 My list does not consider GUI changes (because they are subjective) and ignores bugs/crashes/slowness of the new Outlook.
 Here&#x27;s what I found so far...
 New features:
  
Pin/Unpin Email
 Snooze email
 Density has 3 choices instead of 2
 Can preview message text next to subject in message list
 Board
 Integrates MS Loop cloud components
  
Features removed (in no particular order):
  
Customize ribbon
 Ribbon cannot be hidden
 Choose columns to show in message list
 Separation of categories from subject in message list
 Shared categories cannot have color

                              <span>Hello,
 In advance I would like to thank anyone who has any thoughts on this.
 I&#x27;ve been pulling my hair out unable to fix it. But I&#x27;m no Azure admin, when it comes to troubleshooting. Just a guy doing his best.
 We have 6 users onboarded onto a file share in Azure files. They access it from onsite/wherever they are. The storage account itself is &quot;StorageV2 (general purpose v2)&quot; &quot;Hot Tier&quot;.
 The files stored in here are company Excel files. Some of these files are able to get into excess of 50-100MB. With lots of links, formulas, etc.
 The issue that is occurring seems primarily occur when accessing files larger then 1 or 2 MB.
 The issue being that when a larger excel file is accessed the windows file explorer (explorer.exe) will hang. Sometimes it will return to function within seconds, but it generally needs to be closed via task manager. 
 It is replicable on multiple computers, so I do not think it is a local issue, and occurs both offsite on home internet, on onsite on our guaranteed 1000/1000 link, I had begun to think it was an IOPS issue but I can&#x27;t find any reports on throttling in the azure monitoring.
 I am at a bit of a loss of where to go to from here, view the process and what it is waiting on in task manager when it is hanging gives me &quot;one or more thread of explorer.exe are waiting to finish network I/O&quot; as if explorer.exe has stopped communicating to the internet, but the file will finish downloading and launch. still.
 I am just absolutely confounded. If anyone has any ideas or could point in the right direction of some information to check out, I would be eternally grateful.

                              <span>Does anybody know labor laws in California that well when it comes to On-Call Policies?
 Recently, my company shifted to a new company, and everything has been so hectic. We&#x27;re about 3 months into the new company, and we still don&#x27;t have a defined on-call policy. My management has been making up rules on the fly as we go, and it&#x27;s really starting to get to us. We went from being restricted, to no restrictions and a loose &quot;1-2 hour response time&quot;. Instead of standby, they were doing block hours, where ticket &#x3D; 2 hour pay, but as of today they&#x27;ve taken that away. We&#x27;ve been told that our overtime for on-call is basically just &quot;whatever we worked&quot;. Except, we&#x27;ve been told that we still need to look at tickets (we get texts for urgent tickets), but we need to decide if we&#x27;ll respond or not. If…</span>

When attempting to launch the store they receive an error message stating that it has been blocked, and to check with your IT or system administrator. Code: 0x800704EC
 It&#x27;s definitely GPO related as the event viewer&gt;store&gt; operational, states that it has been blocked by policy (Event ID 4), show error page. 
 All settings in the GPO relating to the store seem correct, but i did find the following in gpresults reporting... @(Microsoft.WindowsStore11606.1001.39.0_x64_8wekyb3d8bbwe?ms-resource://Microsoft.WindowsStore/Resources/StoreTitle) This rule might contain some elements that can not be interpreted by the current version of GPMC reporting module.
 Anyone run into this recently, or have any ideas?

I&#x27;ve only been able to find an ubi while searching the registry.access.redhat.com registry. And if so has anybody had any level of success using the ubi images to sync the full RHEL 8 and 9 repositories?
 edit: The &quot;registry.access.redhat.com/rhel7/rhel&quot; image is still available, I meant the equivalent image for RHEL 8/9.

                              <span>I got laid off today due to restructuring in the company. 
 I told my staffing agency. They felt sympathetic and will do what they can to find me another job.
 I’ve been getting interviews, with startups, mid size corporations and even Amazon. Some of these manage to go past the initial phone screen and to the hiring manager. I even had one where I talked to an executive. 
 What am I doing wrong? Is it due to the market? I admit that I know Azure, AD, Office 365 and have used Windows server but don’t have advanced knowledge, especially of server backups. I have 2 years of work experience, a Business IT Management degree and am studying for Network plus (which I have failed many times before sadly)
 How can I conduct myself in interviews better? I do dress up in an office shirt with a tie.
 I am in NYC, which is very competitive, like many other cities.
 How quickly do people get rehired after layoffs? Will a staffing agency help you find another position?

I am a part of a small infra team managing around 1200 onprem servers and we are currently using Solarwinds, however, I feel like there must be many better thought solution… We need to monitor: Esxi hosts VMs (windows, linux) Physical servers Network traffic Etc.
 Edit: forgot to mention that I have worked with zabbix and I absolutely love it! However, management is against open source solutions so when I pushed for it, it got shot down faster than a Russian helicopter flying over Ukraine…

                              <span>As I force myself to start using and testing the new Outlook (preview build 1.2023.515.100) I find that I have little as far as options go for handling data or attaching another PST. This is all so new that reviews and feedback are little to none, but I found this gem on answers.microsoft.com 
 https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/outlook_com/forum/all/new-outlook-wont-open-pst-files/cfa936d7-acca-4d75-8791-bd0c253cb96f 
 &quot;The feature doesn&#x27;t exist in New Outlook.&quot; 
 I think we&#x27;re all going to have lots of fun when this is pushed to production.

                              <span>I just started as IT Manager at a new company. I spent the first month trying to get a lay of the land because I dropped in almost blind. The previous manager left before I started, so I had to feel my way through the company structure without a guide, or documentation. 
 Today, while the exec director (my supervisor) is out on vacation, she called me into her office and asked me to set her up to access the documents on his desktop. Why not. Idgaf. 
 So I opened explorer and \CompName\c$ and boom she was in. No pw authentication prompt. I checked AD and she&#x27;s a freaking domain admin. 
 I was warned she had control issues, but that&#x27;s just bonkers. To put the entire company&#x27;s security at risk just for power that you don&#x27;t know how to wield is a sign of some deep issues. Any anxiety I had is out the window. It&#x27;s like seeing someone naked.

                              <span>Just as title says. We were just notified that the company is removing the cellphone reimbursement for everyone across the board, and the expectation is that we will still use our cell phones at personal expense. Any suggestions how I deal with this? We are in California and the law seems clear on this. I&#x27;ve reached out to a law firm to discuss.

                              <span>Covered previously here. 
 In 2020 the VP of Engineering left and tried to elevate me to the lead Tech Lead on top of the other Tech Leads sitting on top of Engineering. Since he was leaving, though, as well as the IT Director, I feared they would put me in charge of all of IT if I accepted, so I suggested a peer structure for the tech leads, which is what we went with.
 Fast forward a year and the interim IT Director leaves and they don’t replace him. Fast forward another year and they ask me to be the Director of IT as discussed in that previous post. I assessed what was needed, recommended they hire a director of IT with experience in IT management and tried to move on.
 A couple of months later they asked me to take over some temporary IT responsibilities while the main IT person was on vacation. A few months later they ask me to manage him. 🤦‍♂️ I again reiterated that they should hire an IT Director and that I would prefer to stay in software development, managing engineers.
 A couple of months later they laid me off as some in the previous thread predicted.
 I suppose the lesson in there could be to just do whatever job they ask you to do and suck it up, but the lesson to me is that I had it sniffed out for 3 years earlier where this was all headed. They wanted a Director of IT on the cheap and without listening to the recommendations of their own staff.
 It&#x27;s still burning me up when I think about it. I was functionally doing the job before being laid off. I just didn&#x27;t agree to it being permanent.

 Anyone ever wonder if they sound as bad as they think they do when singing at the top of their lungs in a room of white noise hoping to never be heard… yet forget in our day in age we have audio/video recordings potentially anywhere?
 I just hope the team gets a laugh and an enjoyable serenade 😂 at least I’m working on my karaoke 🎤 🎶 skills 😆 😝

                              <span>Due to life and reasons, at 59, I&#x27;m trying to find an IT job after a long time away.
 Twenty years ago I worked in IT; my last job was VB programming and AS/400 MS-SQL integration. Since then I&#x27;ve been a stay-at-home dad, with a homelab. I&#x27;ve also developed some electronics skills and been interested in microcontrollers, etc. I&#x27;ve been into Linux since the 90s. I know I have the skills necessary to be a competent asset to an IT department.
 I&#x27;ve been applying online, and about half the time I&#x27;m told my application&#x27;s been viewed more than once, but I&#x27;ve yet to receive any responses beyond that. I&#x27;m usually only applying to system or network admin jobs, seeing as the engineering jobs usually want college; I have no degree.
 Should I be trying to find a really small, 1-2, person IT department and give up on the bigger corporate places? I live in metro Detroit. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

 Damn you Microsoft. Damn you......

                              <span>Just wondering if y&#x27;all have ever experienced this or have any courses of action to take. 
 My Org has a Microsoft Surface that we keep off of our domain - it goes to trade shows and contains no protected information. However, we pulled it out this year and the password to get into it did not work. Our sales team has locked themselves out of it entirely. There is nothing of major importance on there, but they do want to get into it to pull the stuff that is. 
 It is locked out, and I don&#x27;t have the option to switch the user to login to the local admin. It is not on our domain, so I can&#x27;t go through that. I may be explaining this poorly. 
 Is it hopeless to try to get back into it?

                              <span>It&#x27;s deeply saddening to see all of our favorite products being shifted to a subscription or pay-as-you-go model. Vendors getting greedy with licensing. Nickel and diming customers to death. 
 - Microsoft Office
 - Anti-Virus
 - Servers (cloud, etc)
 - Networking (Meraki and others)
 - Veeam (licensed per-vm now instead of socket-based)
 ​
 are there any vendors left that allow you to buy perpetual licensing? I understand the reasoning for them - continued stream of ongoing revenue. I miss the days where you could buy a product and use it until EOL without yearly subscription fees, aside from maybe warranty/support.
 ​
 What is the future for IT? Subscription workstation hardware? I guess that&#x27;s technically VDI. Good grief.

Something we have access to is the kspice kernels in Oracle Linux (rebranded RedHat). In theory this takes away much of the pain of a patch cycle but how hard is this implementation?

 ​
 My organization recently ordered two Dell PowerEdge servers, each with dual CPUs (8c/16t per CPU), and set up a vSphere environment with vCenter. I have made a template for Windows Server 2022 Datacenter and had questions regarding the WS licenses we received. The licenses are &quot;Windows Server 2022 Datacenter (16 CORE)&quot; and we received two product keys per each of the servers. Is there anything I should know if I were to assign these product keys to VMs? I read that the WS22 DC licenses are unlimited use per host compared to the Standard edition. If they are unlimited use, can I use the same product key on each of the servers running VMs? We are attempting to do failover on the servers as well, which is currently set up; we just need VMs now. Also, am I able to add the product key to the template I made and every future VM from that template will be licensed as well?
 ​
 Any insight is appreciated.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been trying to stand up a new domain controller. Cloned a VM of an existing one and started updating it. However I&#x27;ve hit a massive roadblock. Since this is for a different geographic location I figured we should update our list of time servers to include something for the west site so when the east site becomes a smouldering crater everything can still keep running. Redundancy and all that. 
 Our existing domain controllers have 4 time servers already, but they&#x27;re all in the east. So I hop into a Powershell session on the new DC and hammer out the following:
 w32tm /config /manualpeerlist:&quot;server1.domain.com,0x8 server2.domain.com,0x8 server3.domain.com,0x8 server4.domain.com,0x8 server5.domain.com,0x8&quot; /syncfromflags:manual /update 
 I get the message that the command ran successfully. All good right? I go to verify with:
 w32tm /query /peers 
 Bad news. Nothing has changed. It&#x27;s still the same four time servers that were originally there. 
 I&#x27;ve spent the better part of a week researching and attempting all permutations of the command I can think of to induce literally any change to the list and nothing. I&#x27;m throwing in the towel on this one. I need help.

                              <span>We have been experiencing some brute force login attacks against some of our sites over the past 12 hours or so. Upon further digging all of the IPs are in Sprint ranges. Upon digging further with NMap they all have 3128/tcp open squid-http. I then did a more detailed scan and came back with:
 3128/tcp open squid-http? | fingerprint-strings: | GetRequest, HTTPOptions: | HTTP/1.1 301 Moved Permanently | Date: Thu, 18 May 2023 12:46:31 GMT | Content-Type: text/html;charset&#x3D;utf-8 | Content-Length: 0 | Location: https://www.tplinkcloud.com/
 Which made me think of recent articles:
 https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-infect-tp-link-router-firmware-to-attack-eu-entities/ https://duo.com/decipher/mirai-botnet-attackers-exploit-tp-link-bug
 We are going to report this to sprint as well but is it possible we uncovered a much bigger thing here? Are sprint customer routers being compromised and no one is aware?

                              <span>In summary, we have a large organization with more than 400 clinics connected through a s2s VPN. My current project involves identifying all the X-ray machines in our clinics along with their respective models. We have a variety of brands such as ICAT, Planmeca, Vatech, Sirona, Dexis, and more. The success of this project is crucial as any inaccuracies could jeopardize my job. I aim to automate the process, but due to the diverse range of X-ray machine brands in our environment, finding a universal solution is challenging. The operating systems of the devices lack consistency and sufficient detail for a simple network scan. Additionally, not all models provide this information in the registry. The best approach I can think of is to rely on human input, albeit with the potential for human error. I plan to email each clinic manager, requesting the model and serial number of the X-ray machine, or even a picture of it, to ensure comprehensive accuracy.

                              <span>Hello, 
 I have been asked to get &quot;encryption&quot; set up on emails for users that are sending sensitive information externally and internally. 
 What I have done so far is create a rule inside of exchange that states if the subject has &quot;Encrypt&quot; in it, then apply m365 Message encryption and rights protect message with &quot;Encrypt&quot;. This works great when sending to an external email, it forces the recipient to authenticate to view, and allows them to download and view an excel or docx file attached. 
 The issues is internally, if I send a encrypted email to anyone within my domain, they can view the message but not the attachment, it tells them to request permission and that does nothing? I have tried to go into properties of the file and add the domain user but am unable to. I keep reading about IRM settings, but have so far been unable to locate where I can edit those. 
 If there is a better way to go about this whole process, please let me know. 
 Thank you for any guidance you can provide.

                              <span>Recently I started replacing monitors for some users and have had pushback from managers on why I am replacing something that works. They have no issue when we install a new computer, laptop, or keyboard/mouse and those have a shorter replacement schedule. But monitors have been getting pushback. Screens do fade over time, and the newer hardware is generally lighter, thinner, and better connected options. 
 Our schedule is Desktops/Laptops - 4 years, Monitors - 6 years, Network - 6 years, Copiers/Printers - 6 years. All of this is subject to change based on needs or growth, but this is the guide we follow. We have some gear that is a lot older and not been replaced such as monitors that are 8 years old and some printers that are the same age. 
 Curious if I am way off on this or what others have as a replacement schedule?

                              <span>I have a client that uses SharePoint Online as their file server and they map their library as a network drive by first enabling IE mode for the SharePoint site since IE no longer exists, then adding the library as a trusted website in Edge, then going to Map Network Drive and using the folder address to the library to map it as a drive letter. 
 What benefit does this have over simply adding the SharePoint folder as a shortcut to their OneDrive?
 Am I missing something?

                              <span>Hello everyone, I would like to ask for maybe stupid question, but I didn&#x27;t find any answer yet.
 I&#x27;m new as a sysadmin and we&#x27;re currently changing our ISP. My coworker told me that we need a pool of 4 public IP address for each office we&#x27;ve.
 I asked the reason and he told that we&#x27;ve to split it for security like:
 - Public IP Address for VPN
 - Public IP Address for posting content(webpages, ftp, etc.)
 - Public IP Address for Internet surfing
 Well. As I said, I tried to search for that but I din&#x27;t found any answer. So do you think guys this is a tipically practice in business ? Or it&#x27;s a foolishness ? 
 If that&#x27;s true, how can I get info about that for document myself ?
 Thanks !

 We just found around 30% of our computers does not get language pack install.
 Any idea what would be explaining language pack missing? There are no language pack install on fault computers.
 The issue seems to be random.

                              <span>I&#x27;m being asked to increase the security of a company, small/medium size (100s of clients), very high value/volume of money (many billions per year).
 obviously the network is already segmented, one aspect we are considering is client protection and isolation, I was thinking it would be nice to prevent potential lateral movements between clients, so blocking everything between clients and allowing only traffic to/from allowed servers, they even have a nomachine based browser solution for employee to go on the web on personal/non work sites, so I can really come up with a specific list of allowed traffic.
 I&#x27;m a linux guy by trade, so I don&#x27;t know much about windows/AD, has anyone done this?
 when I looked at the default windows firewall rules there&#x27;s a bunch of useless stuff there (at least in this context), I was planning to nuke the default profile and make one from scratch, what should I do for AD? is this it?

 any unforeseen consequences I should be aware of? any pointers you guys have?

                              <span>Hey all. I’m stumped and hoping you can help. 
 Our client suddenly stopped receiving mail yesterday around noon. 
 I checked Admin.Microsoft&gt;domains and found this message &quot;The name server (NS) or Start of Authority (SOA) records for your domain aren&#x27;t set up correctly. Check the NS records and the primary name server specified in the SOA record to make sure they are valid, internet-facing, name servers hosting your domain&#x27;s records.&quot;
 I also ran MX and NS lookups on whatsmydns.net. Both returned with near zero propagation. (NS is showing resolution in Mexico City, Russia, and Pakistan but nowhere else)
 DNS records are entered correctly in our registrar (domain.com) and have not been recently changed. I chatted with their support and they kept saying “wait 24 hours” and “everything looks good on our end”.
 At this point we’re ready to just switch registrars to stop the bleeding, but I would love any other ideas if y’all have them. 
 TIA

                              <span>Operation wise or update wise - in general I think everything works quite well. 
 I don&#x27;t have issues like 10 or 15 years ago where quickest solution was to reinstall system and any software that was there or restore image. 
 Hardware seems also much more reliable. Even printers... 
 Well should not be surprise because a lot of people are working to do so. 
 Wondering if it is just me being lucky with environment I work in, me being just much more experienced to properly setup stuff or don&#x27;t touch things I should not, but maybe it is just N&#x3D;1 and everyone else has different opinion?

                              <span>UK based, currently have ~3 years exp as a solo sys admin for an entirely cloud based (azure + m365) fintech adjacent startup. I quit last November for a &#x27;sabbatical&#x27;. My plan was to get the az-104 cert, both as extra evidence I know what I&#x27;m doing and so I can fill in knowledge gaps, plus it gave some justification for the sabbatical in interviews.
 Unfortunately I need a new job sooner than expected. I&#x27;ve been studying, but after taking a practice exam... It isn&#x27;t looking great. Based on my last job I&#x27;m confident in my abilities in practice, but the practice exam seemed very based on memorising minutiae instead. While the exam wasn&#x27;t great, tons of grammar and spelling errors making it hard to parse, I do believe the types of questions are representative.
 I can continue to study but I&#x27;ll end up going over budget, or I can pause this, start interviewing now without the cert, and hope for the best.
 Do you think there will be a significant difference between my offers with 3 years azure etc experience + 6 months break vs the same but with az-104 picked up in that time? Would mentioning my cert goal and studying help? I have very little interview experience :(
 Tldr: difference in ability to land a good job with or without az-104 after 3 years cloud sysadmin exp, and a break?

                              <span>I have a friend that&#x27;s making a fairly radical career change and will be starting as an entry level IT support/sysadmin with a smallish company (very modest footprint - Windows laptops, half a dozen servers, SIP phone system, a bunch of printers and some very conventional networking). 
 He will be supported by me (~25 years in IT, experienced Windows/Linux/etc engineer), but my background is pretty much all self-taught/on the job. His new employers are happy to put him through a moderate amount of training to get him up to speed and support his growth, but I have no idea what certifications currently offer the most value at this level. MCSE? Comptia? 
 Any suggestions people can offer (and any supporting info they can provide) would be very welcome.
 Thanks...

                              <span>In the days where everyone was in the office we used an on-prem web proxy from Sophos which gave us really good reporting on websites visited and ability to block categories etc. We have moved away from Sophos for our AV now and with hybrid working it wouldn&#x27;t have worked anyway so I&#x27;m interested in what people use to monitor, report on and block web sites. For a bit of background our endpoints are intune managed but most of our apps come from citrix servers which are on prem. We have a sonicwall firewall but its not doing any https inspection and would only cover people in the office anyway.

 Can i get something like a weekly report from Windows server to my email, on a dashboard or pdf document etc which shows information such as
 -how many new accounts were created in a time period and details of the accounts
 -summary of user account lock outs, password resets etc
 -summary of user account that were disabled, deleted etc
 -summary of server restarts, shutdowns etc
 -Summary of DC logins with IP addresses, user etc
 -summary of remaining free DHCP IP addresses
 -etc
 More like something that will give some information on the health of the server, activity or i can quickly glance to see anomarlies which can later be drilled into

                              <span>Hey Everyone,
 I&#x27;am a sole Sysadmin in our company with about 250+ users based in Europe. I started around about 1 Year ago there and cleaned up a lot from IT Assets, Processes and Policies short I got some structure in IT there before I was there there were almost nothing just chaos. We are a fully SaaS Company and in general I manage all SaaS tools (Google Workspace, Slack, WorkspaceONE and couple more tools we dont have an Provider like OneLogin but at the end I try to Automate everything to make it a bit easier for me) for our Hardware we are currently 50/50 one half is managed by us the other is managed by our Hardware provider but ofc. I also manage them. Little sub note: all devices that comes from our Hardware Provider are MDM managed all others are getting added by myself step by step you know its pain sometimes to get first all the Users Device Informations (Have to ask them). Since couple months it can get really busy almost max. of my cap thats why I wrote some more policies and telling the users to always using the IT Helpdesk if they have any Questions. Now I had a meeting were they ask me to write down my tasks I did last week and asked my about IT Outsourcing to Support me e.g as Backup when being Sick or on Vacation. I told them yes we can check out but I am not sure if this would be the solution In my opinion we should get another sysadmin there) I &#x27;am also a bit scared about if maybe I get replaced after they Implement the IT Outsourcing since I worked a lot in the company and did a lot changes I would be really sad If something like that would happens.
 ​
 Somehow I feel since the Meeting not quite well, I always think about it. Do you have any tips? atm. I&#x27;am on vacation for 4 Days without any Backup.
 ​
 Best regards,
 kpwde

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m setting up new WiFi network for the office using Meraki APs and want to use AD authentication. I&#x27;ve set up the NPS server (WS2019) as explained in the documentation, but I have problems with windows 10 clients. 
 I think the configuration is correct since I tried with with other devices and are connecting without problems. With W11 I can connect using computer and user account, and with iOS and Android with ad user with no problems.
 I already re-checked NPS policies, check that 802.11r is disabled on APs. W10 clients are on 22H2 so sholud be ok, right? And as I said basically all the other devices are working... 
 In the logs the only I see is error 16 - Authentication failed due to user credentials mismatch, but credentials are right.
 Did anyone face this situation? Thanks.

I&#x27;m just wondering if there is any way for me to find any machines that I&#x27;ve missed that are still authenticating through it. Google seems to just give information about the current machine you are on, and which DC that machine auth&#x27;d through.
 ​
 Any advice appreciated. Thanks

                              <span>Hello,
 I hope I explain well. english is not main language and that&#x27;s also what makes my internet searches more difficult.
 I am at my wits end here with a legacy software that we want to use through RDP on some older Datalogic Skorpio (x3 and x4) 
 The problem is when creating new users:
 the user is added to several groups, most importantly group that autoexec c:\myapp\launcher.exe
 (through the GPO &quot;Start a program on connection&quot;)
 our launcher then allows to start other apps they need, one of them doesn&#x27;t work right away tho
 it&#x27;s an old 3rd party (obsolete, but will require a couple years to phase out) that requires some cache temporary folders in c:\users\user\appdata
 this folder doesn&#x27;t exist when creating a new user and with the GPO &quot;Start a program on connection&quot; apparently is not created properly
 THE WORKAROUND: the workaround is to remove the user from the &quot;autoexec&quot; for aa few minutes, log in manually to that user so windows creates those folders upon first login, then add the user back to the &quot;autoexec&quot; GPO and now everything works
 ​
 so, when logging in manual once, %appdata% cache folders are created properly (with proper persmissions) but when the GPO &quot;Start a program on connection&quot; is enabled from the very beginning, it doesn&#x27;t work
 we don&#x27;t have remote folders or any of that.
 is there a way to solve this so we don&#x27;t have to log into the user manually without autoexec every time we make a new user?

                              <span>Hello,
 We are experiencing issues with a bunch of machines reverting their Version of Win10. It could be something else but as far as we found out, if one of our AD-Admins logs in to a computer where a normal User was logged in, the Win10 Version get&#x27;s downgraded to Win10 Pro from Enterprise. Not a big deal at the moment but in our reports we&#x27;re having like 100 Pro Versions now where there should be a solid 6k Enterprise. Funny thing is, when the User logs back in to his PC it takes ages to get it back to Enterprise by himself or the Azure Sync.
 Our Users have an MS E3 license. Admins don&#x27;t have a license as of now. 
 We already had a MS Ticket open and they provided us with the solution to just run a PS-script but we are still searching for the root cause to eliminate that. 
 If we run slmgr /dlv we can see in the script host window that it&#x27;s Win10 Pro and licensed but on the Win10 settings pane it says Win10 Enterprise, which is also strange.
 Anyone else having such issues? Or similar things? Have to be honest that the AD-Admin Accounts are just our first guess.
 Thanks

 I&#x27;ve been a Sysadmin and a CISO before in both small and large orgs, but with decisions from others able to work their way in that were let&#x27;s say, less than long term scalable.
 Would like to see people&#x27;s thoughts on &quot;getting it right from the beginning&quot;, 
 The company has a domain, investment at the start is good so we don&#x27;t need to cheap out. 
 The domain is registered and it&#x27;s time to build around it. I was thinking:
 Infra going into AWS. Manage domains in Route53. Office 365 for Exchange, DLP, etc) AzureAD for Windows Device Management, SSO, MDM, Conditional Access etc etc. Windows Devices (i7, 16Gb minimum, anything less is mea…</span>

                              <span>Hi there
 maybe you can assist me :)
 i have 1 Remote Desktop Server (Win 2022) and 10 Users. There is only 1 Workstation.
 the single Workstation will be used hourly bi other people. so my plan/wish is:
 ​
  
User 1 goes to workstation, put in his smart card (as example an yubikey)
 Remote Desktop will automatically start and require the PIN from the User 1
 Session Start....
 If the User unplug the SmartCard, RDP Session close (user still logged in)
 User 2 goes to workstation...
 ...
  
i was able to set up this scenario for the most part with yubico:
 https://support.yubico.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013707820-YubiKey-Smart-Card-Deployment-Guide
 but this is not 100% user (and admin) friendly, i&#x27;m not able to autostart rdp on plugin yubikey, sometimes i have to change from user/pw to smartcard manually. on unplug yubikey an error message (from mstsc.exe) appears...
 is there an company / tool who can handle this scenario? do you know an &quot;all in one&quot; solution for this? i believe there must be many company&#x27;s (hospitals, retirement home&#x27;s etc.) which work similarly to this...
 thanks a lot :)
 edit:
 - all on prem, azure ad is available...

 They are finding that a very small percentage of URLs look legit but redirect to NSFW sites. The datasets are large so the URLs can&#x27;t all be manually checked. Is there a service that can access a potentially large list of URLs, check where they are redirected to, and flag if the site redirected to is NSFW or hosts malware?
 Thanks!

 Must have the ability to connect without the user approving - so we can make changes while they are at lunch

                              <span>Hi all, I am looking to set up a SOHO network supporting 10GoE, which will have around 6 workstations, two NASs with dual bonded nics, printers, a WAP, and a few other network connected devices. There are times of heavy data transfers of 1TB or more and regular transfers of ~50GB+.
 I’m thinking a minimum 24-port switch, which will allow for future expansion. I’m looking for suggestions on a switch, that will probably need to be managed for possible future VLAN setup. Please let me know what you’d implement and what you’d avoid. While I will likely have the support of the IT department, this will likely be managed locally by me, with some networking (and learning more rapidly) knowledge. Thanks in advance!

Thinking of moving them to Aruba switches and wondering if I can mix in the Arubas with the existing Netgear as I make the transition. What might be the most significant issues that would likely present themselves in such an environment? Or will these switches play nicely together while I swap them out over the coming months?

                              <span>Hi I have never seen this strange problem. ASA firewall is in multicontext mode. 
 I&#x27;m trying to ping hosts on directly connected network but can&#x27;t see reply. I can see correct arp entry on the ASA. ICMP inspection is enabled in global policy. Access lists is any any on both inside outside interface. Strange. 
 Any idea what&#x27;s going on?

                              <span>Hello,
 I recently took over a new network and we have been asked to reduce cost across the board including our SDWAN. Currently we use an MSP with Velocloud devices. We pay ~$1000/month on average per branch for the Velocloud managed-service. Most of our branches are very small ~5 users, leveraging Velocloud Edge510. We have ~20 sites.
 I have a couple of questions:
  
Can Velocloud devices be customer-managed? (wondering if we can save by removing managed services)
 Does anyone have good experience with any other lower cost &quot;branch router&quot; options that have simplified/central management? It doesn&#x27;t have to be SDWAN necessarily but if it is SDWAN, we are looking for an SDWAN that can be customer-managed so that the cost is lower.
  
Thanks.
 Edit:
  
Just found the $1000/month average was skewed by mid/large sites. My apologies for the confusion!
 The correct average cost for small sites with Velocloud Edge510 (with 30Mbps throughput) is around ~$200/month per site, this includes hardware device(s), license and managed-service (it&#x27;s a bit lower for sites with a single VCE router and higher for sites with dual VCE routers).
 Based on the comments this appears to be a more reasonable cost for the small sites though it&#x27;s still good to see what others are using or recommending for lower cost alternatives. Appreciate it!
  
Thanks again!

                              <span>Ok I have taken a picture and uploaded it here for my question:
 https://ibb.co/P1dK5Zp
 On the remote logging target page of the ISE server, WHY oh WHY is the only option you can choose for the SSL certificate the ISE will present to the remote syslog server, a &quot;CA&quot; certificate. The ISE is not used as a CA, it&#x27;s a client/endpoint with its own system certificate, only. It is just a node with its own publically signed SSL cert. Yet, you can litreally only choose a certificate from the trusted source certificate page, which is a page dedicated for Root/Intermediary CA certificates. So the config doesnt make sense. It&#x27;s like the ISE is saying to the syslog server, Hi syslog server I am some upchain CA server, we good?
 If you read the Cisco ISE documentation in the link below, under the section heading &quot;Configure Secure Syslog Remote Logging Target&quot;, it states, step 12:
 &quot;Choose the CA certificate that Cisco ISE must present to the secure syslog server from the Select CA Certificate drop-down list.&quot;
 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/ise/3-1/admin_guide/b_ise_admin_3_1/b_ISE_admin_31_basic_setup.html
 So you are forced to present a CA certificate, even though we don&#x27;t use the ISE as a CA server. So how are you supposed to use a a regular system certificate to present itself to the syslog server?

                              <span>I recently started working in market intelligence for a tech company and I need some resources to understand the high level networking business. By high level I mean (eg. if we talk about WLAN, we segment the business based on enterprise access points which are further segmented to indoor and outdoor and then by generation) I want to understand the use case and the terminology used in SD-WAN, Campus Switches, Data Center Switches, SASE. 
 Any advice on how to start would really help me (a lot)

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been troubleshooting a call center getting &quot;ICE Collection timeout&quot; messages from AWS. They are using AWS connect. So far it&#x27;s just this one site that has been having these issues and I&#x27;ve been troubleshooting this for about 3 months now along with various network seniors in the company. We&#x27;ve been on calls with AWS and everyone else which brings me now to the minds here at reddit.
 This particular site hasn&#x27;t been upgraded to Cisco SDWAN yet and is currently running GETVPN. At the beginning of this month we had our ISP (AT&amp;T) Upgrade the links from 100mbps to 250mbps links with no change in ICE errors.
 People who work from home don&#x27;t see the errors but the vpns they have on the laptops use the split tunneling.
 Yesterday I chatted with the ISP (AT&amp;T) and got reports from them about their links as well as did various tests from our datacenter to the site and everything came back clean. I cleared the counters yesterday at the site as well as rebooted the entire network about a month ago. We really haven&#x27;t seen anything to indicate a network issue besides call center reporting ICE errors. 
 From the AWS side they&#x27;ve pretty much pointed back at our network.
 So, what are your alls thoughts or questions I could look into to help?
 Thanks.

                              <span>What is everyone using for DNS HA Load Balancer?
 I would like to have 2 front-end public dns ha load balancers distributing requests to 4 back-end public dns servers.
 If read that HAProxy can do HA Load Balancing but that’s only for TCP applications. Since DNS mainly runs on UDP is there something similar for it? 
 I’ve tried Nginx proxy setup for UDP and it would work for about 100-200 requests but for public resolutions of 2-5k it can’t handle the load as it doesn’t respond fast enough.

 I would like a company to come in, pick it up and get rid of it somehow.
 Any recommendations for such a company?

                              <span>Hi,
 I have a setup where I&#x27;m trying to achieve the following:
  
Juniper MX204 with JunOS 21.4R3 (AS65001) as EVPN gateways
 Mellanox SN2700 with Cumulus Linux 5.4 as spine (AS65100)
 Proxmox node with Frr 8.5.1 as hypervisor
  
All works fine, the Juniper, Cumulus and Proxmox nodes can ping eachother IPv4 and IPv6 loopback addresses just fine.
 The problem is that the EVPN MACs aren&#x27;t installed in the MAC databases of the Frr and JunOS routers.
 JunOS  JunOS works, but Frr  JunOS doesn&#x27;t,

                              <span>I&#x27;m reading through technical documents provided by a wholesale broadband provider and would appreciate assistance with understanding how this works.
 The wholesale broadband provider operates an LAC. I&#x27;m trying to understand how you would configure LNS, eBGP etc. Assuming I have only 1 tunnel end point:
  
 Domain Name Tunnel End Point Addresses (/32) 
  
 broadband.example.com 1.1.1.241/32 
 
 And here is my eBGP info:
  
 eBGP Peers (2 Per Resilient Link) 1.1.1.240/30 
  
  1.1.1.244/30 
 
 And address range to eBGP peer mappings:
  
 Address Range (LNS) Corresponding eBGP Peer 
  
 1.1.1.0/24 1.1.1.240/30 
 
 My Questions:
  
Can my tunnel end point address be the same as my eBGP peering address?
 Can my LNS be within the BGP peering range?
  
I may be completely misunderstanding this so if someone could provide a sort of summary of what all this means I&#x27;d be grateful. Thanks!

                              <span>Just checking my thought process here I have a business ISP router that&#x27;s got a 4G Failover that links to that router only. I do not want double NAT though and want the firewall to handle all this.
 So is it ok in this scenario to put the ISP router in DMZ mode to the firewall? In a way it just then acts like it&#x27;s not there and as if it&#x27;s just a WAN?
 Is my thought process correct?

                              <span>Probably very basic for y&#x27;all, but I need your inputs if there is a better way to do this.
 As the title said, we have 2 separate networks.
 Each have their own firewall/router.
 Each network have their own ISP.
 How to use the ISP of the other network as backup internet in case main internet goes down?
 (Sometimes will use the backup internet while main internet is still active, but not all the time) 
 Kindly refer to the images below.
 This is basically my question:
 The_Problem 
 This is my initial Plan:
 Is_this_a_Stupid_Idea? 
 I can&#x27;t wrap my head around this.
 ISP Modems using PPPoE so I can&#x27;t directly connect the other Network&#x27;s firewall to it.
 So I guess I have to put something in between the ISP Modem and the firewalls, to do the NAT.
 But it feels like it just adds to latency and more devices, plus more point of failures.
 I feel like there is a better way. 
 Hope somebody can suggest. Don&#x27;t flame me. :D

                              <span>A few team members regularly take notes in notepad as .txt files. These are often scratch notes that never get turned into process documentation even though they should. 
 Others use a bland looking Word document template. 
 We have a file share and a SharePoint Wiki that just acts as a second repository for our documents. Seriously, we dump .docxs and .pdfs into both places and hope someone will see them. 
 Not everything feels like it should be in a Word document. If I&#x27;m ever writing some CLI syntax, word just feels wrong. If I&#x27;m writing configurations out as part of a process of provisioning template, word feels wrong. I like Markdown a lot, but I don&#x27;t have a good way to share these files or make them collaborative. They also don&#x27;t have a lot of theming or &quot;pretty&quot; features to them, which can be seen as a upside and downside. 
 How can I, without becoming our &quot;documentation person&quot;, improve how my team documents things? Right now, people either document things poorly, or not at all because we just don&#x27;t have any good methods of documenting things. Nobody has ever seemingly taken the time to improve how we document.

                              <span>Hi. I would like to understand what the pure theoretical way to use different bands would work. 
 If I have a single large room, and at each end is an AP. I have users with PC/laptop/phone that want maximum speed (Wireless AC/AX). I have smart devices in the area, that just need a tiny message to start and stop (Wireless N). 
 In regards to best radio interference, theory. What would be the best config? 
 Can I set the N to 20Ghz. Then tell the AC/AX to use only the 40/50Ghz range, not 20? 
 Would that be the pro way to set up a simple system? Thanks for any tips. Cheers.

                              <span>My company is looking to implement RPKI. I&#x27;ve read some of the RFCs as well as plenty of blog posts. We are a very small team and do not have time to implement route origin validation using available OSS. I&#x27;m looking for a vendor to manage the implementation for us.
 Does anyone have recommendations?
 I found just one so far, has anyone worked with this company - Defensor Cloud? Looks like a startup and doesn&#x27;t even have an updated website.

                              <span>I have a spine leaf vxlan environment (Cisco 9k using nxos) using evpn for the control plane. On my border leafs I have an aggregate network in BGP to advertise network summary to edge firewalls, but want to block that summary from advertising to downstream leafs (downstream leafs have two /25 networks, I agg them to one /24 and advertise to FW). I’ve created an export route map on the vrf context on border leafs matching the aggregate prefix to block, but it is still being advertised. I am able to block the prefix on import maps at downstream leafs but want to block at source. Can I get another pair of eyes on my config? I am still fairly new to evpn so I may be missing something simple or fundamentally misunderstanding how this works.

                              <span>I want to set up a redundant infrastructure with two RADIUS and Fileservers and wanted to use Kemp Load Balancer free, though the throughput is only 20mbit.
 My question: The load balancer, as I understand, only handles the initial connection/handshake, correct? So 20 mbit should be sufficient I guess? 
 If not, I would switch to the integrated Windows Server Load Balancer.
 ​
 Appreciate any suggestions!

                              <span>We have a two Linux devices on VMware ESXi hosts, if I ping from the console of either to a internal device (Server, PC, Printer or gateway) I get the normal Ping response.
 If I ping externally to 8.8.8.8 / 8.8.4.4 /Google.com /bbc.com, second ping is a DUP!, I have done a packet capture on the LAN interface of the firewall.
 No. Time Source Destination Protocol Length Info
 1 0.000000 172.16.4.5 8.8.8.8 ICMP 98 Echo (ping) request id&#x3D;0x0002, seq&#x3D;1/256, ttl&#x3D;63 (no response found!)
 2 0.000060 172.16.4.5 8.8.8.8 ICMP 98 Echo (ping) request id&#x3D;0x0002, seq&#x3D;1/256, ttl&#x3D;63 (reply in 3)

 Then the process repeats, I&#x27;m note sure I&#x27;m reading this right but it looks to me that the fist ping does not respond in time so it sends a second then the first one responds then followed by the second and that is seen as a DUP!.
 I have built a clean raw install of Ubuntu 22.04 (i think) on a different ESXi host and date store, but it does the same after first login and is still doing it after the system is upgraded.
 There are no duplicate MAC addresses on the VMWare.
 There are no Duplicate IPs in use
 My next step is to install Ubuntu to a laptop and hardwire it to the network on the same VLAN.
 Can anyone make any other suggestions that would help diagnose this issue.
 Thanks Simon

                              <span>Hello guys!
 I have had multiple attempts on establishing a L2L IPsec tunnel using certs that I installed on both ASA firewalls using NDES SCEP from a Windows Server 2019 AD CS VM. The certs are RSA 2048 based with SHA 512 signature. I tried both IKEv1 and IKEv2, the tunnels work perfectly if I switch to PSK, but when I use certs, for example with IKEv2, it gets stuck in IKE_AUTH step. FW1 sends the fragmented cert to FW2 and FW2 sends a response and then after a few seconds they start negotiating again.
 If you guys need wireshark captures or configurations, let me know. I also tried both policy based and route based tunneling using VTI, same result.
 Thanks.

Looking at the dashboard it really doesn&#x27;t give me a lot of information to work with and it is very difficult to run a packet capture because it happens so randomly. Is there a better way to approach this issue or a proper technique to troubleshoot this. I am planning to setup a Linux DHCP server, I am thinking it might be related to Windows environment. If that doesn&#x27;t work I am planning to setup DHCP services within our core switch since all of our Meraki switches are just L2. Feel free to share any suggestions or tips how I can go about troubleshooting this.

                              <span>I work at a university and we have an newer outdoor athletics facility that has fiber ran to each corner of the facility. The boxes are built into the ground so that they&#x27;re inconspicuous. The issue is that each winter they fill up with water, it ruins the GFI switches to the power inside and the fiber that comes into a second smaller box located inside still gets filled with water and gets dirty. They were barely able to host the event this year due to this issue but it&#x27;s been a recurring problem for the 3 years the facility has been built. 
 So my understanding of the setup is: fiber from a pressbox to a subterranean enclosure, fiber goes into that box into a smaller grey box that does something I don&#x27;t understand, we then bring a switch that we keep inside a pelican case over and plug the fiber from the small grey box inside the subterranean enclosure into the switch, then all the necessary devices plug into the switch using ethernet. The water is getting into the small grey box and breaking things each winter.
 I don&#x27;t know enough about networking to hold an eduacated converstation on the topic with you all but I just got out of a meeting with some people that presented me with a solution to this issue that I didn&#x27;t like. They admitted they don&#x27;t know how other places do it so we&#x27;re all kinda hunting for solutions to this issue. They want something above ground but since it&#x27;s an athletics facility that would require a box right on the edge of a playing field which presents competitive, asthetic and safety concerns. 
 Is there a box or setup of some kind that can be left in an underground enclosure that would be able to stay dry for a number of years? I asked if there wasn&#x27;t a way to cap the fiber cable coming into the subterranean enclosure with a cap that was waterproof then just bring the boxes and switches for the events each time but they said there&#x27;s no cap that would keep it clean enough. 
 Any thoughts or solutions would be appreciated!

                              <span>I have a Cisco stack 3650 I am adding a new vlan to. This switch stack currently has multiple vlans already talking to each other just fine (10.1.2.x , 10.1.5.x) and I am trying to add a 10.1.7.x subnet with a new vlan into the switch. So far devices on the new vlan I created on 10.1.7.x are able to ping the switch and the vlan gateway, but they cannot reach any other part of the network or outside wan. I am unsure what else I need to do to make it so this new vlan is able to communicate with the rest of the network, attached is the configuration https://imgur.com/a/myL4Uxz/

                              <span>I have a Metro E circuit where the provider is blocking certain protocols so I lashed up a VxLAN configuration to get around the blocking. Essentially I built a L2 circuit over a L2 pseudowire that is built incorrectly on the carrier side. 
 I&#x27;m very familiar with SP L2 MPLS but this is my first foray into VxLAN. The need is simple at the moment and I&#x27;m curious if I can decouple EVPN. 
 I used the following guide/chapter to get the VxLAN circuit built:

 Current WiFi originally designed for visitor access, new design needs full floor production coverage. I have all the Meraki APs needed but it would be nice to visually map based on model. I could do this with Ubiquiti’s heatmap tool and try to reference an AP like the MR 53. 
 Any software or tools that will accept a floor plan to map? 
 Thank you for any info.

                              <span>We have a Ramtel R733 analog emergency phone we are trying to connect using a D-Link DWR-920V which is a cellular home &amp; business phone provided by US Cellular. The issue is that the R733 wants ~10vdc off-hook and the D-Link device only provides 8vdc(tested with multimeter). According to some research the R733 is pretty sensitive about voltage so it has to be pretty close to 10v for it to work.
 Is there any sort of solution that would provide the 10vdc off-hook that it needs without replacing either the emergency phone or the cellular device? We need to stick with US Cellular because we don&#x27;t want to open an account with another provider. If we did need to replace the emergency phone, are there options that would work with 8vdc? We have power in the location it is going so something that requires additional power is possible as well.

                              <span>I apologize if this is not the place to put this question but I am having a hard time finding a resource online. Basically I just want a basic template on how a dACL is writtein in ISE. We are doing a lot of port security / 802.1X and I am now deep diving into the world of dACLs. I don&#x27;t want to keep bugging my level 2 guy and would like a better understanding.
 I know there is source address and source ports etc and what keeps throwing me off is where all the &quot;any&quot; words go.
 So can you break down some of these examples?
 permit udp any any eq 123
 and
 permit tcp any range 4000 4006 any
 Any tips or info would be appreciated.

                              <span>Guys, a conceptual doubt... 
 I&#x27;m doing a lab on OSPF, BGP, VXLAN, IPv4 and IPv6 eve-ng.
 I have 2 geographically distant DCs connected via peer BGP with 2 ISPs.
 My idea is to configure VXLAN between the 2 DCs so that overlay customers can travel in their networks transparently, as if they were &quot;Regions&quot;, as it is in the public cloud.
 Speaking of IPv4, I don&#x27;t see a problem, because the customer&#x27;s network IPv4 is a non-routable IP on the internet, so I have 1 gateway in the customer&#x27;s network on each DC.
 My question is about IPv6, which is a routable IP...
 Well... basically I want to connect two IPv4 and IPv6 overlay networks of geographically separated DCs.
 I would like to talk about this issue, as many of you work with these technologies on a day-to-day basis, so I wanted to learn a little more about it.
 I couldn&#x27;t put the eve-ng topology image here, so the link is below:

                              <span>I am in a situation whereby i have mis-configured one of my miniature computers with the incorrect IP address, Gateway and DNS and this computer has since lost internet connectivity and i can no longer access it remotely to make changes to it anymore. I cannot reset it to factory default because it does not have such a function to do so. The device always dials back to a remote web site where i use it to make changes to it. 
 My question is, what can i do, to allow this miniature computer with the incorrect static IP addresses to regain internet access so that i can configure it online.
 ​
 Would connecting it to another computer with internet connection and bridge the ethernet port to the wireless ethernet enable the miniature computer to regain internet access?

                              <span>I haven&#x27;t used a Cisco Wireless controller in over a decade. New job just had a pair of 9800s installed in load balancing mode. I do not see anywhere that you can find the connected device statistics. On the dashboard, I see the top APs by data usage, but I can&#x27;t drill down. I went through all the menu items and I cannot see any individual device statistics. 
 Am I blind?
 Running Version 17.3.4c for reference
 Edit: to be clear, I was looking to sort clients by data usage. For example, one AP is in a remote location, but is in the top 3 APs by data usage. I would like to see what is using so much data on that AP.

                              <span>I’m looking for recommendations. I’m very new to networking and I am looking for a book that will talk about networking in a very general sense. Something that is a bit more readable, rather than a manual (I’ll get there at some point).
 Looking to read about how it works, rather than why it works, if that makes sense. Something to familiarize me with the terms and concepts. TIA.

                              <span>I stumbled upon strange issue with Dell S5212F-ON switch. I had to force a FEC mode on an interface and now I can&#x27;t reset it to the default state. For some reason the default interface command does not work as well as no fec. I need to make ethernet1/1/12 configuration the same as ethernet1/1/11 but I get an error. Any tips?
 dell1(config)# default interface ethernet 1/1/12 Proceed to cleanup the interface config? [confirm yes/no]:yes % Error: ethernet1/1/12 2-0 dell1(conf-if-eth1/1/12)# no flowcontrol transmit dell1(conf-if-eth1/1/12)# do show running-configuration interface e1/1/12 ! interface ethernet1/1/12 no shutdown channel-group 12 mode active fec CL74-FC no switchport mtu 9216 flowcontrol receive on flowcontrol transmit off 
 I need it to look like this:

                              <span>We have a few larger projects coming up that involve quite a few unfamiliar elements. I&#x27;m working on planning the processes out, but am having a hard time organizing my information. We&#x27;re an Atlassian shop, but I find Confluence a bit too unstructured for this, and using Jira would involve a lot of effort for something that might change frequently.
 Do any of you have favorite or useful tools for this type of planning? I don&#x27;t need actual project management tools as things like dates or timelines are a bit premature at this point. I feel something like a Gantt chart without the timeline would be helpful--just tracking dependencies and breaking things into subtasks.

                              <span>Currently going down a huge rabbit hole.
 I live in a town that&#x27;s between 2 other towns. It&#x27;s a weird grey area. The town to my left has a great wide cable internet connection, and the town to the right has a vast fiber connection. However, my town has basically nothing. No cable, no fiber, only 1 WISP that is just awful. Purely LOS, unstable connection, lower than 10mbps down, 0.5 up. It&#x27;s terrible. The company has been sold twice, and still zero improvement, or care to improve.
 It&#x27;s been like this forever, there&#x27;s never been a good internet company here, and there never will be (for a long time at least).
 I have to rely on cellular internet, which isn&#x27;t even viable for the others in this town because it&#x27;s not as simple as Verizon Home Internet or T-Mobile home internet, it&#x27;s not offere…</span>

So my 2 questions are: 1. How to make sure to have the most recent installer for the different tools. Can I automate this?
  
Is an USB-Stick the best solution or is a M2 SSD for external use better in this case?

                              <span>Is the ironport esa still relevant? Lately we have been seeing some pretty blatant phishing emails get through the appliance and it appears to be missing some rather malicious files. I’m wondering if the appliance is still relevant, or if others have had similar experiences? 
 Anyone have feedback when comparing the ironports to proofpoint or other options nowadays? Thanks for any feedback /insight!!!!

                              <span>Within the year I will be tasked with deciding on the brand and specs/model of workstation that we will be purchasing and deploying in our next refresh. I&#x27;m not interested in which OEM everyone loves but more so what is part of your decision making process when it comes to purchasing? I&#x27;ve always been of the opinion that today&#x27;s average desktop is WAAAAY overpowered for what an average worker needs that&#x27;s just running Office or editing an occasional PDF which is what most of our users do. How does your org decide things like minimum CPU, RAM, HD size, etc. ?

                              <span>I have a standard 19&quot; 42U server rack with EIA square holes.
 Some of my mounting rails with 10-32 threaded holes are meant to be screwed directly into the square holes. The rail sits flush on the rear face of the post and the screw goes directly into the threaded hole from the front, no cage nut, right through the square opening.
 They came with these 10-32 screws with a low profile flat head (the shape, not the socket) and a wide diameter head to cover up most of the square hole and provide a secure fit.
 The manufacture doesn&#x27;t sell any extras, and when I search for 10-32 server rack screws, I just get a bunch of regular ones with big domed heads. I need them to sit as flush as possible to the mounting posts.
 Is there a specific name for this style of screw, and are they readily available from common suppliers like CDW for example?
 Thanks in advance.
 ps. In general, just buying new mounting rails while it is the obvious solution, is not possible in this situation, I&#x27;m an academic researcher and I can&#x27;t really allocate funds for something that has already been done, especially when it still works. I just need some more screws.
 Edit: Thank you to u/St0nywall for figuring out I needed some 1421 mounting hardware by hammond. Life saver.

                              <span>No right answer I guess and obviously this isn&#x27;t the default setting.
 Most linux VMs or vendor &quot;appliance&quot; OVFs usually have open-vm-tools so I guess my question is aimed primarily at Windows VMs.
 What do you do and why?

                              <span>Basically what the title says. We have been remediating some vulnerabilities that were found by the cyber risk management platform our insurance company uses. 
 I provided some evidence to remove a vulnerability found and the support team warned us that any “HTTPS exposure” coming from the SonicWALL is on the radar of insurance carriers as a potentially uninsurable asset. The recommendation is to move to an alternative firewall solution such as Cisco, Cloudflare, etc. 
 Anybody have any insight on why this is?

                              <span>So I might have a domain example.com that I expect to send mail. I will configure an SPF record appropriate for this. Fine.
 But if I have a subdomain sub.example.com that does not send mail, is it best practice to explicitly configure an SPF record on this subdomain to state that it does not send mail?
 I can&#x27;t find any specification that explicitly recommends or states this. I can however find specs recommending to configure one for root domains that do not send mail

 ​
 I want to create a culture of &quot;don&#x27;t fuck with IT&quot; at my 90 person org. We get endless emails, texts, and teams messages with &quot;my lappy doesn&#x27;t know me anymore&quot;. Or a random badge with a sticky note on my desk &quot;dude left&quot; and laptops covered in sticky shit and crumbs with a sticky note &quot;doesn&#x27;t work&quot;.
 ​
 How do I set a new precedence? I want a strict ticket template that must be filled out before defining that IT has actually been contacted.
 ​
 Does anyone have a template or an example email memo that can help me down this path?
 ​
 Thank you.

 Even now, I still see Drobo devices still in use on occasion. I&#x27;d look at finding a replacement whenever possible, just because their BayondRAID format is not open, and if the enclosure dies, it will take sending the data to OnTrack to recover it.
 Ages ago, they were an innovative company, where RAID on the desktop was a useful thing. However, they never really made anything big after that, other than an iSCSI target, and eventually NAS models. Synology and QNAP eventually ate their lunch.
 In any case, time to decommission any Drobo storage appliances in use.
 Edited: This includes Retrospect, so if one is using Retrospect for backups, time to find a VAR and find a replacement ASAP.

It makes sense your superior doesn&#x27;t want to see you watching Youtube videos when you&#x27;re supposed to be working, but here&#x27;s the thing : to clock your time in, you have to take your time spent on a ticket and do a formula to convert it. Then we use a fucking old version of Navision to report our time, it&#x27;s slow and clunky. 
 Some days we are extremely busy so we don&#x27;t have enough time to report everything we do, then next month comes, higher-ups see the numbers and say &quot;you&#x27;ve reported nothing! You didn&#x27;t work at all this month&quot; yeah of course asshole I spent more time actually working instead of trying to show you that I do work.
 ...Couldn&#x27;t they just let us live? Is it like this where you all work?

                              <span>I have been noticing some tickets stating &quot;No tenant identifying information found&quot; and it seems to be caused by customers using the Safari browser. They are attempting to access their email and AVD. It works fine with Chrome/Edge and Firefox browsers. Has anyone else noticed this? Is it an on going issue with Safari and Apple? TIA.

                              <span>Hey all,
 Curious to how you are managing users such as devs that need local admin to do their jobs effectively?
 Read about each dev machine having their own &quot;dev vm&quot; environment where they are full admins and other similar segregation methods.
 We are doing some Cyber security certs at the moment and I need to prove people aren&#x27;t using admin accounts with access to the internet or email and I&#x27;m struggling to fathom how to manage 30 devs when there&#x27;s only me as the primary IT resource. 
 I use Intune to manage all workstations.
 Thanks

                              <span>I do not want a fucking headshot included in my email signature. It just weirds me out and it’s quite an unusual practice…
 I have raised this concern and it hasn’t been taken seriously. I think the email signatures are being centralized on Microsoft 365 and will not be in anyone’s control except for IT.
 Is there a way to get around using something like that or what? Is it just automatically applied to every email and you can’t do anything?

                              <span>Just needed to rant a bit. I have gone through 4 account managers in two years thus far. Each of them start out so enthusiastic and very prompt but, it&#x27;s like a trend for them to fall off over time. I&#x27;m dealing with one account manager now that has not responded since May 11th with any useful information. It&#x27;s like they do not want to do any work, unless they are making a sale. The hardware lately has also been bad, maybe I just get lemons. I have been using Dell more and more, shooting for Lenovo too soon. Anyone else experience this with HP?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been noticing a significant increase in computers encountering login issues recently, specifically due to either an unavailable domain or a failed trust relationship. I work at an MSP and have come across this problem across multiple clients lately, so its not just an issue with one specific domain. While it&#x27;s a relatively easy fix to log in as a local admin and redomain the machines, the fact that this error keeps cropping up more frequently makes me wonder if there&#x27;s something Microsoft might have messed up.

 I have a 2012R2 Server (not domain-joined) that I recently patched and it seems like that while the issue started shortly after, other 2012R2 Servers have those same patches and RDP continues to work.
 The Event ID 36888 &quot;The Windows SChannel error state is 1205&quot; is due to a TLS 1.2 handshake error and I&#x27;m wondering if you&#x27;ve every successfully resolved this and how?
 I confirmed that the Server&#x27;s self-signed\Remote Desktop SSL Certificate doesn&#x27;t expire until 9/8/2023.
 These were the patches I applied:
 April Update kb5025288
 March Update kb5023764
 February Update kb5022894
 KB5023790 
 Thank you for any help/suggestions you can offer

                              <span>I work for a car leasing company and they *insist* on having a dedicated mailbox for each major customer, and the appropriate customer support representative have access to it. Sounds good on paper but this process has gone unchecked for many years and now users have 20+ shared mailboxes each.
 This is causing outlook to constantly break (a man can only make so many new outlook profiles) as they are trying to use it as a CRM tool. 
 I have not got enough authority to implement a CRM so my question is this: What are some alternative solutions to this problem? 
 I have though about each team having a shared mailbox, with an alias for each of their respective customers. As well as caching only 6 months emails to help aleviate the strain on .psts.
 Another option would be adding members but disabling auto-mapping off, forwarding all emails into a team mailbox and the users then simply change who they are sending as.
 Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated, thanks in advance.

                              <span>So 12 years of dedicating oneself to a single company has come to an end. Putting up with doing first to third line, fixing a server with a full disk to someone’s teams not integrating with outlook. 
 The last company was the straw that broke the camels back, I’m all up for doing multiple things in our line of work but expecting 3 peoples jobs from one person is too much, only hearing problems from people for years has broken me. 
 Moving onto contract work now, let’s see how different that is? I like the concept of having a set job to do and when it’s done that’s it, no expecting more or anything but also what kind of shit show will you be walking into ?

 What can I show to prove that I didn’t receive an email from the Home Office? 
 The home office denied my application for indefinite leave to remain because they claim that they had earlier sent me an email requesting for information and that I hadn’t responded. I checked my email and nothing came in from the home office either on the date they say they sent the email or any other date for that matter. 
 Thank you very much

                              <span>Hi!
 ​
 While testing an update from PDF24 Creator (9.x to 11.12.0) I found out that the registry paths has changed (as written in their documentation). This leads to missing printers in PDF24 Creator although they are shown as local installed printers.
 But the printers aren&#x27;t working.
 ​
 I searched the web for a solution to keep the printers after updating but found nothing at all.
 Therefore I post this solution so anyone who didn&#x27;t do that update because of this behavior can update now without reinstalling the printers.
 ​
  
open regedit.exe as admin
 search for HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\PDFPrinter\Serviceshere are all PDF printers - each one got a folder (i.e. 1A2B34CDEZ)
 right click the folder and export it as .reg
 edit the exported .reg with notepad
 change the key pathfrom HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\PDFPrinter\Services\1A2B34CDEZto HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\PDF24\Services\1A2B34CDEZ
 install the new version (auto deploy, manually, whatever) and reboot afterwards
 open regedit.exe as admin -&gt; Data -&gt; import -&gt; import .reg files
 reboot your device
 open PDF24 creator settings -&gt; printers -&gt; printers must be shown now and working properly
  
​
 It is that easy.
 ​
 Could be working for automation as well - I didn&#x27;t try it for the few devices.
 ​
 Best wishes

                              <span>Preparing to move a customer from our Hyper-V 2019 cluster to a new Hyper-V 2022 cluster, we build a new cluster with three Hyper-V 2022 hosts. Created the port profiles, the logical switch and logical networks through SCVMM. Placed a test VM on the cluster, made it high available and when powering on it triggered a blue screen on the host. Then the 2nd host noticed host nr1 is down and took over the VM, tried to power it on and then also BSODed. Then host nr 3 took over and also BSODed, etc, etc....
 The BSOD screens al show vmswitch.sys as the cause of the BSOD. We&#x27;re using Cisco blades and firmware / drivers are all at the level requested by Cisco. Windows 2022 is a fresh install with all the latest updates applied.
 My guess is maybe the UCS policy for the nics is not correct. VMQ settings? RSS? RSC? And this causing a BSOD because a conflict in settings???? 
 Can&#x27;t find any Cisco docs about specifically Windows 2022 Server Hyper-V on UCS.
 Any tips?

 Can anyone advise, the best way to set up an internal DNS deployment without any local compute? We have an AWS account which is connected via s2s vpn to local site. 
 Is it just to run a bunch of EC2 instances with BIND installed? I’m just wondering if I can leverage private hosted zones in R53 some way as we already use this for DNS management.
 TIA!

Simple monitoring solution that can be installed on Linux
 Can be configured to monitor SNMP hosts
 Can import vendor specific MIB files (probably should go without having to say)
 Everything about the install/configure can be downloaded and installed in an air-gapped network (ie. packages, docker images, ova&#x27;s, etc)
 Email alerting
  
There&#x27;s lots of options out there for sure, Cacti, Nagios, LibreNMS, Zabbix, etc... I just need to quickly get something stood up that can start recording sensor (temp/power/fanspeed) values of some of our server hardware equipment.
 Bonus points if it can also be configured as a syslog server to be able to record and alert on activity logs.
 I know it&#x27;s a long shot but I figured I&#x27;d ask what folks are using.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;ve been offered a sysadmin job at a small company where I would be the only IT/sysadmin person. My skills are more in software engineering, but the job was offered to me and thought I&#x27;d take it. The company heavily relies on Azure and the M365 suite for most things including MDM, but even with all of that functionality, there are 30+ applications/software/systems external to the M365 suite that I have to learn how to use and offer support for. I recently found out that the person who is currently the sysadmin is leaving probably a week after I join and has to pass all this knowledge on to me in that time, which I already know isn&#x27;t going to happen. Personally , it&#x27;s an immense amount of pressure on me being the only person who would have the role of a IT Technician/Sysadmin, especially when someone comes to you with a problem and lurks over you as they expect you to fix it there and then. Any suggestions on what I can do to make my life easier when starting this role and relieve some of the pressure? This is my first sysadmin job, not a massive noob, but I do lack experience though. Thanks :D

                              <span>Hello fellow admins! 
 I have a backup file of a server that I want to perform a checkdisk on.
 Now before I do that, because it holds valuable data, I was wondering what the best practice would be for creating a backup/local copy of that backup file.
 Is it safe to just use windows copy and paste or robocopy? Or is there a better way to copy that file? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Since a couple of weeks I notice that I get more UAC messages accessing random folders on Windows Servers that never gave an issue before, even when using a domain admin account (when logged in using RDP). In the past this folders never gave this problem. Access is also no problem. Today we noticed that a couple of desktop apps that are auto starting on a Windows Server did not start due to an exception (Exception Info: System.UnauthorizedAccessException). Starting the app as Administrator solves the startup. Anybody else seen this behaviour? Ii checked the UAC and that is not causing this.

                              <span>I work for an MSP and we will be dropping Cisco in the near future.
 We use Cisco firewalls (with ASA OS, not Firepower) mainly for their excellent VPN client, AnyConnect.
 What alternative firewall has the best VPN for end users?
 In sequence of importance we care about the following in a VPN solution:
  
Stability (shouldn&#x27;t drop the connection at first sign on network trouble)
 Support for 2FA
 Ease of use for end-user
 Ease of pushing new config to client
 Ease of initial installation
  
(The reason we are dropping Cisco is primarily because they have become impossible to deal with for SMB. We spend way too much time on licensing and contract renewal.)

                              <span>Hi!
 I just took over a super old setup and started digging through it all step by step. 
 I just came across some errors in the event log stating that a couple of certificates have expired back in 2020 and haven&#x27;t been renewed automatically. In this case it is on the primary DC holding all FSMO roles etc which is also CA.
 I don&#x27;t have much experience in this particularfield, so just want to be sure that I don&#x27;t break anything by just using the certificate renewal wizard to renew it, either with a new key or using the same key? :)
 Thanks!

                              <span>How does everyone approach patch management with software that lacks auto updates?
 Such as software you have to download an installer and run it as admin to update.
 You obviously can&#x27;t trust users to be able to handle this, it&#x27;s providing an open door to the system.
 At work we&#x27;re dealing with several peices of software that lacks auto updates across about 400 users. 
 The only solutions we can think of is manually remoting in and updating the software or giving certain members of staff admin access such as managers to run the install.
 Thoughts?

 &quot;I am trying to monitor Hyper-V and its VMs. I&#x27;ve tried using this template (https://github.com/a-schild/Zabbix-HyperV-Templates) to discover the VMs and their items, and it successfully discovered the VMs. However, the discovery rule to detect CPU, RAM, services, disk, and other metrics of the VMs did not work.
 So, my question is: Is there any other template available that I can use to monitor Hyper-V and its VMs, or do I need to install the Zabbix agent in each VM?&quot;
 Thanks.

                              <span>Dear fellow sysadmins, I&#x27;ve encountered something rather strange which I haven&#x27;t yet seen before and I&#x27;m unsure on how to resolve it / find the cause. I write this in the hopes that someone can point me in a direction where I might be able to find out more about the issue.
 System is running Windows 10 22H2 build 19045.2965, browser is Firefox v113.
 To the issue itself:
 When I try and reach https://www.\[domainname\].com it gives me an error and says &quot;Access Denied&quot; &quot;You don&#x27;t have permission to access &quot;http://www.\[domainname\].com/&quot; on this server.&quot;
 Which I find highly suspicious because being redirected to an http site might pose an security risk, which is why I believe the client/DNS cache and thus the system itself might be compromised... It&#x27;s only this one specific site that yields the issue.
 Have any of you encountered something like this? I&#x27;ve disabled all the browser&#x27;s addons, but to no avail. Just ran in-depth malware check on the system, but it yielded no detection at all...
 Any ideas what to do next/what to look for?

 Domain A is managed by DFN. The web server for domain A was provided by my employer. Due to lack of staff, web server provisioning has been discontinued. We received a backup before the shutdown. The administration of domain A should remain with DFN.
 We then purchased Domain B from STRATO, including the web server. There we imported the backup and made the site available again.
 Domain A is well known by everyone and appears high up in Google. Therefore domain A should be redirected to domain B without an underlying web server. The support at DFN has entered the IP address of the web server of STRATO for domain A, which appears by a ping. However, STRATO can apparently not process this request, so that when the IP is called, simply a &quot;Not found&quot; appears.
 The support at DFN has no idea, and I do not know enough about the subject. He said that this is due to the configuration of the web server at STRATO.
 How do I get the problem solved?
 Thanks :)

                              <span>Hi, users are reporting that since this month&#x27;s update they have trouble logging in when the screen locks. IT discovered the reason is when the screen locks, the keyboard layout doesn&#x27;t default back to English like it normally did but stays at the current language being used. Users&#x27; passwords are always &quot;English&quot; since that&#x27;s what the keybord layout normally defaults on the lock screen. So they keep getting wrong password, until they mouse over to change the layout.
 I tested and it seems to be affecting Windows 10 (22H2) only. Windows 11 works as expected. Anyone else seeing this? All of our users use multiple layouts and it&#x27;s causing a lot of grief.

                              <span>Dear all,
 We have an incident with 2 RICOH SP 4510 DN printers because we can&#x27;t connect on the WEB interface of this one.
 The customer has many other RICOH models and no problem but the problem persists only with these 2 printers of the same model.
 There is no network blocking because the printer / workstations / print server is in the same subnet (We have checked anyway).
 We have updated the firmware of the 2 printers.
 We have reset both printers to factory settings.
 We have contacted RICOH support but they don&#x27;t help us much.
 We have reset the remote certificates on both printers.
 When we want to access the WEB interface, the error message is &quot;ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED&quot; as if the printer refused the connection.
 In the Ricoh firmware update software, the error message is &quot;Failed at TLS communication&quot; but there is no blocking at the network level and we can update the Firmware with no problem.
 This happens only with these 2 printers, for all other RICOH it&#x27;s ok everything works fine.
 In short, we have done everything but nothing to do unfortunately.
 Has anyone had a similar case / can anyone help us with this ?
 Best regards,

                              <span>I’m an IT manager at a small university. A user in our physics department has a Precision 3460 that was installed by my predecessor. In order to “increase security” on this box, the user decided to set both the system and admin passwords … and now has forgotten both. 
 After this machine is reformatted to its initial factory state, I’m going to have to hunt down all these machines and make sure users can’t get into the BIOS. 
 But I’ve never encountered quite this situation before. It used to be you could take out the CMOS battery for 30 seconds or so and the password(s) would be wiped. Not so, apparently, for the 3460. Googling and product manual searches yielded no help, so I’m appealing here for assistance. 
 Any ideas, folks?

                              <span>I had an on-site audit yesterday (account wasn’t old enough yet) and woke up a bit late. Heading there I wasn’t the most civil driver and when I was close to work I flicked off some slow driver that was clearly confused and wasting my time. I pulled into the parking lot and headed for the door only to see the offender pulling into out parking lot. Less than 15 minutes later we were introduced, turns out this man is our auditor. After a grueling day, I can only hope we pass. Felt like a lot of his findings were extra for some reason, no clue why… Don’t be like me, drive calm. 
 Anyone else have similar experiences? It’ll be a while before I live this down.

                              <span>Hi. Last year, I got an opportunity to work as Network security on a 1 year contract. Since I joined, my colleagues never liked me (they have been there for 15+ years and expected me to do what they tell me to do rather than working as a team). However, my manager have always been supportive of me and understood the dynamics of how my colleagues would underpin me being the new guy. Now my position became a full time but i have to reapply like all other applicants. Recently my manager hinted that someone else applied internally and he seems to be a good fit as he got along well with my current team and that guy has been referred from top management. And he suggested if I would be okay to continue working for another 1 year contract. I felt bad and hurt as I invested in couple of certs in this job hoping my hard work and my certs would make me a good candidate once the position becomes full time. My manager told me he likes how I am always calm and thoughtful and he told me to think about his plan. I didn’t express my emotions or said anything when he told me this news. Now should I tell him I was hoping to get this full time and hoping to be part of this company growing up the ladder. Or should I just stay silent and start applying elsewhere?

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious, and have no idea of best practice here. In a Windows-centric environment where there are also a couple of Linux servers (Debian mostly), do you join the Linux servers to AD and use the AD-based admin accounts to administrate the Linux servers?

                              <span>hello all, i will be doing a small business ap install soon and will need 35 ish ap&#x27;s and have done 2 unifi installs in the past that were a bit smaller but have never had an issue with unifi.
 however i did some research and seems like engenius fit is a new product and will prob come out to similar price as the unifi install.
 is there a reason for me to run engenius fit over unifi? or should i stick with unifi?
 thx

                              <span>So I am trying to understand the need to have both on our network. 
 Currently finishing up a network upgrade that included a lot of new things, but some of the main things were adding Cisco ISE for radius and tacacs. Another part is adding wireless to our network for the first time. Wireless is all Aruba and we are using clearpass to authorize wireless clients. APs are all Aruba, and also using AIRwave.
 So basically two AAA servers. One for wireless and one for wired. 
 From my understanding, you can do wireless authentication with ISE though. ISE can authorize your wired and wireless clients, all on one device. 
 Is it really necessary to have both aruba clearpass and Cisco ISE on the network? I asked my boss why have both, and his response was so we don’t have to manually enter client mac addresses, I guess they populate when the person connects to the Wi-Fi and then we can place them into the right vlan. But in my experience, ISE does the same thing with wired clients. They get placed into a dead group not associated with a vlan, and then we can assign them to a group. But usually we have them assigned before they connect. 
 My issue with having two devices for aaa is having to manually enter macs in two different devices. We are a building that hosts a lot of short term guest with lots of BYOD devices. So we are always receiving lists of MAC addresses that get approved and need added into ISE. It can be a pain especially when getting calls because of connection issues then finding out it’s because someone can’t tell the difference between their wireless mac and wired Mac, plus typos and other errors. I just feel it’s unnecessary to have two devices if it can be handled by one. So just wondering if there is a bigger reason why clearpass and ISE are needed that I may be missing?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hey Everyone,
 I&#x27;m looking for 60mmWave solution to allow me to do a point-to-point solution to connect two properties we own that are across the street from each other. Curious what everyone&#x27;s experience with Cambium has been? They seem to have a following, but I&#x27;m curious what actual users think.
