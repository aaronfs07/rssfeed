                              <span>Does anyone have a powershell (or some other language) script to sync data from BambooHR to Azure AD? I&#x27;ve been searching, but all I&#x27;ve been able to find so far is expensive paid integrations, and the instructions to the BambooHR API, which is unfortunately a little beyond my skillset. I just need a script I can run periodically to grab things like phone numbers, titles, reporting managers, and update that info in Azure.
 I find it disappointing to say the lease that this functionality isn&#x27;t built right in to the BambooHR platform.
 Any assistance is appreciated.

                              <span>Hi fellow sysadmins,
 I need your help on this one.... I have 2 digital signage installation that use 3 monitors each. So total 2 USFF computers and 6 x 43 inches monitors. The problem is that when the power is back after a power outtage, the computers boot faster than the monitors. So the multi screen settings are messed up and I have to mamually reactivate the monitors, redo the settings and reboot the conputers.
 I wanted to use a PDU02IP from Startech, but the delay function does not work on power back after an outtage.
 There no option in the BIOS to delay the power on.
 Di you have any suggestion?

                              <span>Our default domain (&amp; controller) policy gives us the error / warning, that permissions on this group policy object are not consistent with sysvol / active directory (defaultDomainPolicy_error.jpg) 
 Clicking ok won&#x27;t fix it, allthough it does remove permissions added manually to the policy-folder (was curious if it does anything at all).
 Probably my predecessors tempered with it somehow but we can&#x27;t check back on that. 
 The sysvol seems fine to me, as the inheritance is not active and permissions applied look at least somewhat reasonable (filepermission.jpg) but looking at the gpo-permission I get the feeling that it should&#x27;nt be so much. I suspect said predecessors once activated inheritance on those 2 policies, as they get all those permissions from the top level. 
 So on the one hand I&#x27;d really like to resolve this inconsistency and on the other hand ask about if the top level should really have THAT much in its permissions (gpo_permission_X.jpg). 
 As it is the default domain policy I backed off just resetting the permissions to prevent breaking something that actually works as it doesn&#x27;t seem to produce any problems currently.

 Script can be deployed via Intune. Can use the function for either local logging or via Log Analytics / Azure Monitoring / MMA or via (Proactive) Remediation.
 I think the best way to check a large group is via Remediation in Intune.Hope this helps anyone. Any feedback is greatly appreciated. :) I will incorporate it into this script.

 Troubleshooting done:-
 -Cleared Credential manager 
 -Created a new outlook profile
 -Created a new Windows profile 
 -Disabled the cached mode in Outlook
 -added one domain email to Outlook and another to Mail app 
 Issue persists. Opened a case with Microsoft a few Months ago, they provided multiple Reg fixes, that stopped the issue for some time. Came back again. 
 The Business Owner doesn&#x27;t want employees to know email passwords, they had issues in the past. This issue is hitting us hard, every morning we are logging in to their computers to enter passwords.

                              <span>Evening folks.
 This is really bugging the hell out of me. We have a bunch of DL&#x27;s here, and we would rather like to leverage our CA to give said DL&#x27;s certificates.
 I wrote a powershell script that, using the HPE powershell commandlets, will generate a CSR, acquire the PEM from said CA, and install the certificate to iLO.
 However, it&#x27;s a bit clunky and requires us to do... Well, something.
 I know there&#x27;s a bug in 2.72, which most of the DL&#x27;s are on, but I updated a couple to 2.92, and here I am still scratching my head.
 Automatic certificate enrollment seems to ask for the following information;
  
Server URL - As far as I can tell this is the FQDN for our certificate server, and the appropriate /certsrv/mscep_admin/. This is the only URL that it accepts that I&#x27;ve tried.
 
Challenge password - No problem, retrieved from that URL.
 
 *CA Certificate - Here, I start to scratch my head. The NDES page offers a thumbprint, and no certificate. I cannot find this thumbprint associated with any certificate. I have, however, tried teh CA root certificate. I have also, out of morbid curiosity, tried the PEM certificate I generated via certreq.
 It errors out, and tells me to check basically all the settings and DNS.
 I&#x27;m not a CA whizz, so I feel like I&#x27;ve missed something along the way. Someone before my time set this CA server up, and anyone I&#x27;ve asked internally has been perplexed as to why it doesn&#x27;t work too.
 Does anyone have any thoughts on what I&#x27;ve missed?

 I know there&#x27;s a bug in 2.72, which most of the DL&#x27;s are on, but I updated a couple to 2.92, and here I am still scratching my head.
 Automatic certificate enrollment seems to ask for the following information;
  
Server URL - As far as I can tell this is the FQDN for our certificate server, and the appropriate /certsrv/mscep_admin/. This is the only URL that it accepts that I&#x27;ve tried.
 
Challenge password - No problem, retrieved from that URL.
 
 *CA Certificate - Here, I start to scratch my head. The NDES page offers a thumbprint, and no certificate. I cannot find this thumbprint associated with any certificate. I have, however, tried teh CA root certificate. I have also, out of morbid curiosity, tried the PEM certificate I generated via certreq.
 It errors out, and tells me to check basically all the settings and DNS.
 I&#x27;m not a CA whizz, so I feel like I&#x27;ve missed something along the way. Someone before my time set this CA server up, and anyone I&#x27;ve asked internally has been perplexed as to why it doesn&#x27;t work too.
 Does anyone have any thoughts on what I&#x27;ve missed?

                              <span>Hi Sysadmin.
 Hope you can help.
 We have an Sr.exec who insists on using LAN when at his desk (even though we have a banging Meraki Wifi setup that everyone else is more than happy to use) - and uses Wifi when moving to meeting rooms etc.
 His issue is that browser/office365 sessions timeout as he moves from LAN to WLAN or vice versa.
 We use Forcepoint web proxy client on Windows laptops.
 He insists on using Chrome which I&#x27;m sure is the cause of his issues as it caches Proxy, DNS and Sockets via chrome://net-internals.
 ​
 He is adamant that he should be able to switch from LAN to WLAN at will and have all sessions continue seamlessly.
 Has anyone managed to implement this? 
 Any tips on how? Any products used?
 (am thinking perhaps always-on-VPN that gives the client a single fixed VPN IP regardless of connection type.....)
 ​
 Thanks for any advice!

                              <span>Starting around 12 hours or so ago, we started seeing a plethora of iOS devices appearing as non-compliant in Azure AD, causing Conditional Access in InTune to fail, and their native mail app would fail to authenticate. Android users are unaffected.
 We cannot find any relevant outages related to Microsoft services. We saw this, but it&#x27;s not a perfect match for what we&#x27;re seeing.
 It&#x27;s still little fuzzy, I&#x27;m tired and might not have the details right. A few things seem to fix it.
 - Choose Settings &#x3D;&gt; Mail Accounts &#x3D;&gt; Clark Hill and click on Re-enter Password. This doesn&#x27;t work for everyone.
 - Oddly enough, some users we can&#x27;t fix any other way are fixed simply by downloading and logging into Microsoft Authenticator. That&#x27;s it, you don&#x27;t need to actually use it for MFA.
 We think the issue might be related to the newest Company portal app version (5.2307.0) failing to pass long registration attributes. Anyone else running into anything like this? I feel like we&#x27;re actually having two different problems at the same time. This came out of the blue, and I find it hard to believe &#x27;it&#x27;s just us&#x27;.
 Example error from an iOS device attempting to register itself in the Company Portal app.

                              <span>Hi All! 
 I currently am part of a small team of 3 IT people at my company of 400+ staff. My company is currently using Google Workspace as our main identity provider however we also have M365 accounts. We are also using AzureAD for our laptop sign as well as Intune. My IT manager has tasked me with federating our M365 with our Google Workspace accounts which is all fine and well. We have tested this functionality and our staff are succesfully signing into their M365 accounts with Google. However as a result of changing our auth to federation, our test staff are unable to sign into their laptops anymore. 
 I have looked online and have not found any concrete evidence on if it is possible for staff to sign into their laptops (that are bound to Intune) with their Google accounts. Does anyone have expierence with this and know if it is possible or not? If it is, please could you share any resources you have on this. I did discover the Google Credential Provider for Windows (GCPW) during my investigation but have so far have had some strange inconsistencies with it where some of our tests users are able to use it and seeminly log into the enviroment but Intune has not behaved or they haven&#x27;t been able to login at all. 
 We may fully migrate our identity provider to AzureAD in the future however at this point in time, our small team of 3 people doesn&#x27;t have capacity for this. We&#x27;re a fully remote company so we want to make the process to signing into company machines as smooth as possible whilst also reducing security issues (2FA is mandated for our Google Accounts) by reducing the use of passwords as much as possible. 
 Thank you all for your time! I really apprecite it.

 I have some development skills but not enough expereince. I can try to fake it till I make it.
 In reality I&#x27;ll need to find free lance developers that do full stack. Is that a thing?

                              <span>Guys,
 I&#x27;m quite the novice in Azure AD (Entra ID my ass) so please, bear with me - my terminology is surely off. 
 So our org disabled the &quot;Stay Signed In&quot; checkbox some time late last year. However I have realized, that people who&#x27;ve chosen this before (in web apps for example) still do not need to re-authenticate, the tokens / cookies still seem to be valid. (Which, in a way, makes sense).
 Now I assume to revoke all sessions for all users could fix this, but is there any way to do this a little less &quot;broad&quot; (as in: find out who this &quot;affected&quot; by this and address only these users)?
 Cheers!

                              <span>Does anyone in this group have experience with recent versions of this software? I used Laplink years ago with a cable to move apps and configurations when I was upgrading a couple of computers, and the users didn&#x27;t want their setups to change. It worked great as I recall. The company continues to tout the software, but I can&#x27;t get a straight answer around server support. Does their software (or any other known software) support migrating a Windows server to a newer version on newer hardware?

                              <span>Morning,
 We have one domain and one forrest, currentlly how its setup is all FSMO roles are on one DC (I know this is not correct). I found this article on FSMO roles and how to move and distribute them to two servers.
 https://theitbros.com/fsmo-roles/#google_vignette 
 My question is for anyone whos&#x27; done this
  
Can this be done during normal business hours or should it be done in a maintenance window?
 I&#x27;m moving this off the one DC (needs to be retired) to two existing DC&#x27;s that talk to all of our other DC&#x27;s in our environment is there any gotchas i should watch out for?
  
​
 Thanks :)

 Azure Boost VMs in preview can achieve up to 200 Gbps networking throughput, marking a significant improvement with a doubling in performance over other existing Azure VMs.
 This improvement in network performance is made possible by a critical component, the Microsoft Azure Network Adapter (MANA). MANA is tailored for optimal networking performance tailored specifically for Azure&#x27;s demands, bringing improved reliability for virtual machines while providing a set of stable forward compatible device drivers for Linux and Windows operating systems. This means the Azure Boost system can expand network bandwidth to facilitate faster and more efficient data transfers and achieve higher network availability and stability.

 So, first time I&#x27;ve seen this in the 15+ years doing this. User came up to me saying that her keyboard is broken ( uh-huh ). Asked her to login. Nope. Clicked on the eye thing to reveal the password. 
 Wow!
 All kind of weird characters. So I plugged in USB keyboard. That kind of worked. Got to the desktop, opened up Notepad, just went across the keyboard. Holy crap, this thing is f**ked!
 Opened up Settings-&gt;Keyboard-&gt;Install New Language. (English UK)
 Same result.
 No water damage, hasn&#x27;t been dropped. Next step is maybe swap out the drive?
 Have any of you experienced this?
 TIA!

 Can you clarify for me why a small business should have 2 DC&#x27;s (best practice according to Microsoft) instead of 1 DC if the Domain controller virtual machine is being backed up by Veeam ?
 Is the only argument fault tolerance if the other is unavailable ?

 I want to have a custom field that shows the timestamp of when this field was answered on every Incident ticket.
 Is there a way to have this set up in such a way that I can add the timestamp of when this field was answered, in a report on Explore?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Anyone know of a free Scan-To-PDF tool that works with network MFPs? Some of our Helpdesk staff have taken it upon themselves to install some god-awful tool that hasn&#x27;t been updated since 2015 (but at least works with networked scanners).
 I&#x27;ve been searching for ages but all of the ones I&#x27;ve found expect the scanner to be attached locally.

 Personally, I see it as a must in our environment, but the price means it should be rolled out with careful training. Almost gives everyone a PA, at a fraction of the price of an extra staff member.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working in IT in various fields for nearly 15 years now, started of as a deskside engineer, moved to Wintel / infrastructure and I&#x27;m now a technical account manager.
 I work for an MSP and the load of the moment is monumental, Technical debt coming out of our eyeballs, around 4 major projects going, and many many more &quot;minor&quot; projects. Reports are maddening and the firefighting is non stop. Like a lot of people, I&#x27;m feeling really burnt out.
 I&#x27;ve been toying with the idea of getting my Prince2 and moving into project management, as my experience has taught me most PMs don&#x27;t actually seem to have any real technical knowledge, and it could give me quite an advantage.
 The idea of starting a project, working it, closing it down and just moving on to the next seems quite appealing. I&#x27;m aware of the stress of time constraints, but to be honest I&#x27;m dealing with tons of those now as the TAM anyway.
 I&#x27;m wondering if anyone here as made the move and what their experience has been of going from a tech to a PM working in the tech field?

                              <span>Hello there,
 I have heard many things about this adapter, but not only bad ones, some in my company are absolutely in love with them, so I bought one for testing. So far it is set up and FW is up to date. But I have this one problem.
 From every computer I have tested, the first connection works within seconds, but if you disconnect and reconnect, I get an &quot;error, try again&quot; on my TV. I don&#x27;t have to do anything, W10 keeps trying to connect and on its second attempt it works (ca. 15s of waiting). If I cancel when I get the error, and reconnect manually, I get the error again. It only works if i let the laptop reconnect by itself.
 As I said, this only happens if the laptop was already connected once. If I restart the laptop I can repeat the whole thing, susccessful on the first try, error on the second.
 Huh?
 Has anybody experienced this?
 PS: I don&#x27;t have the adapter on my inhouse wi-fi, it&#x27;s a direct connection.

 Just wondering if anyone knows if there is a roadmap for Microsoft deprecating OOB flows for OAuth, like those with this redirect Uri: urn:ietf:eg:oauth:2.0:oob
 We publish a desktop app using this flow, and don&#x27;t want to get caught out when it gets dropped.
 I note that Google have already stopped supporting this.
 https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/oauth2/resources/oob-migration
 I had a quick google, and couldn&#x27;t get a definitive answer.
 Thanks all

 If the GPO is configured with a network path - is the client accessing/downloading the screensaver from this location each time the screen saver is activated?
 Or is there a cache that works in the background somewhere? 
 I suspect its the first option, seen some increase in traffic recently which looks like its linked to a change in the screensaver to a much larger file.

 It&#x27;s Outlook 2019 so there is no &quot;Add online meeting to all meetings&quot; option in the settings menu.
 It&#x27;s on-prem so I cant disable to every user via powershell with the &quot;set-organizationconfig onlinemeetingsbydefaultenabled $false&quot;

                              <span>Hello,
 In the thought there are no stupid questions.... generally, as title says - I&#x27;m still having in one location good ol&#x27; IBM Blade Center H with plenty HS23 blades. It still does it&#x27;s job, but support have ended years ago, runs on ESXi 6.7 (that&#x27;s the newest supported version), some VMs where maybe 2-3 are critical (no cloud possible). My only concern is security - how can I be sure, that old virtual fabric switches are not vulnerable, the firmware is not obsolete, etc.
 What is the reason I should replace this hardware? Let&#x27;s assume you need to explain this to management.

                              <span>Hello Community,
 regarding nowadays security threats we recently had a discussion about whether clicking a link (for example in an e-mail) once can be even harmful or if there is always a follow up action needed, like providing credentials, clicking another link etc
 From my point of view i would say the clickrate on links in e-mails is very high, but not every &quot;clicker&quot; does follow the actual instructions so when it comes to user training i think it is equally important to focus on the potential scenarios after the webpage has opened, rather to only tell them not to click &quot;any&quot; link in an e-mail
 What are your thoughts about this, and which attack scenarios do exist where you already fell into the actual trap by only clicking (lets imagine, you do have an active o365 session in your webbrowser)
 Thanks

 Google suggest to set up SPF first and DKIM before waiting 48 hours, and then setup DMARC last. 
 But I didn&#x27;t know this and set up DMARC first before DKIM. 
 In the end, I set up everything. It&#x27;s just that it&#x27;s not arranged as suggested by Google.

                              <span>So historically we&#x27;ve always used mail-enabled security/distribution groups in AD for email groups. With the ongoing shift to Azure AD from AD (currently we&#x27;re still hybrid) I was wanting to decommission on-prem mail-enabled securiy/dist groups in favour of using the email addresses attached to 365 groups.
 What would be the best way to go about this? For mail-enabled security groups I was hoping to just disable the &#x27;distribution&#x27; component of the groups so that they no longer have an email address, and just add that email address as an alias to the relevant 365 group.
 Should 365 groups be used for email groups? Or should I be setting up distribution lists in Azure AD? Anything I should be concerned about in this change?

 Does anyone have any experience with how the migration works with Dropbox or Google Drive? Since it&#x27;s just really updating the existing profile, all the downloaded files for those apps would still be there. I understand that passwords do not migrate due to new user credentials in the new profile (makes sense) and will have to be re-entered. So, once that is done is Dropbox (for example) smart enough to realize allt he files are there instead of resyncing?
 ​
 On another note, how do apps like Adobe with cloud licensing migrate? OR do they have to be re-registered?
 ​
 Curious on any experience anyone has. AND, if there is a BETTER TOOL than ForensiT we&#x27;re open to suggestions!

 I’d like to thank everyone for some great advice on my last post. I’d like to give you all an update on the situation.
 TL;DR: I got another job with senior position and 13% raise and finally I am out of a shithole.
 ​
 So after my last post, I started applying for jobs while working with my previous company. I’d just do my 9-5 and that’s it. I stopped giving opinions on anything because my insecure manager would always do/plans exact opposite.
 Fast forward 3 months(a couple weeks ago), I was asked to go to the office at 10am for some silly reason on my WFH day. Normally, I’d just catch a train and go but on that day I was taking care of my 13 months kid so obviously I r…</span>

                              <span>i have an ISC2 CC exam on monday and i understand the basics of encryption, but just trying to nail down its affects on CIA &amp; AAA.
 1) so if the sender &quot;S&quot; wants to send an encrypted message to the receiver &quot;R&quot; they would encrypt the message with R&#x27;s public key, so only R can open it with R&#x27;s private key - i can only find information stating that this is purely for confidentiality (because the message is encrypted) but would it also be for Integrity because it cant be decrypted and modified by anyone else but R? 
 i ask this because the other method where S encrypts a message with S&#x27;s private key and send its to R to decrypt with S&#x27;s public key its known for authentication and Non-repudiation (because you know it only came from S) and integrity (because if it was intercepted, decrypted, modified and reencrypted by the attacker and sent to R then it wouldn&#x27;t be decryptable with S&#x27;s public key). so why isn&#x27;t the first method the same and known for its integrity? if anything isn&#x27;t the first method more accurate? 
 on a separate question i understand this second method is bad for confidentiality (because anyone can decrypt the message with S&#x27;s public key), but good for integrity - so what is the point of hashing? if S did encrypt a hash digest to the message, the message can still be intercepted, decrypted, modified, reencrypted by the attacker and sent to R but would result in a hash mismatch, the same way the second method&#x27;s wouldnt be decryptable with S&#x27;s public key.
 If hashing is just a 100% sure fire way to know the message hasn&#x27;t been modified, why is the second method also known for integrity? 
 sorry, long question. thank you for any advice

                              <span>Hi, 
 I&#x27;m working on some AV systems with heavy bandwidth usage on many multicast streams (~10gig per stream) and I&#x27;m weighing up the benefits and drawbacks of extending the fabric with either switch stacking or just LAGG uplinks in some topology or another. It is my understanding that stacked switches will flood all their multicast traffic between all stack members as they&#x27;re logically one switch which is a drawback. 
 However, my question is - will links between stack members automatically loadbalance traffic (so 3 x 10gig fibers becomes 30gig link) - or do you need to setup the stack and then put your stack links into a LAGG effectively meaning you have the same limitations of a LAGG when doing a stack i.e. same limit of number of switchports that can participate in the LAGG.
 If they loadbalance automatically, is the load balancing performed via a different method that would make one method more efficient at loadbalancing i.e. layer 2 or layer 3 hashing?
 I&#x27;m aware this will vary depending on the chip used in the switch but any info regardless of switch brand &amp; model would be useful, particularly Netgear m4300 range.
 ​
 One additional bonus question whilst I&#x27;m at it - is there any difference in the efficiency of loadbalancing when comparing a static LAGG vs dynamic (LACP)? 
 ​
 Many thanks

                              <span>When i plug my laptop into company-network using Ethernet, i dont get an IP-address. I&#x27;ve observed via Wireshark, and see that my laptop sends a DHCP-Discover packet, but never receives a DHCP-Offer packet. I&#x27;ve asked IT and they showed me that the DHCP-Server sends the DHCP-Offer packet. Also, when he plugs his laptop into the same port that i tried, DHCP works for him.
 I&#x27;ve disabled the Windows firewall, tried broadcast/unicast DHCP and also tried another switch.
 What could be causing that i dont receive DHCP-Offer packets?

                              <span>Hoping someone can help advise me on the best tool (under a couple hundred) to track a network cable to a managed switch and it&#x27;s port. These switches I do not have control of other than unplugging and plugging in cables but over the years the room has become a rats nest due to other people not knowing how to properly manage cables. Including the original installers since it&#x27;s across 2 racks and using 3-5 meter cables with zero documentation.
 I have to get new computers onto our network (as well as document current computers switch/port) but need to tell our network team which switch and port it&#x27;s plugged into for them to open the port for that MAC address. Ideally I would like to just use a command line or something simple but thinking of using the wands, however when researching which one to get I saw that some people were having issues using them on managed switches so before I go wasting money thought best to ask the experts.
 For context, I work in a building that has multiple groups all using the same infrastructure and the IT guy for my group with full permission to be in the room, however there are others who also do the IT for their group with same permissions. The network team look after the switches remotely but unless you tell them the specific switch and port they don&#x27;t want to help, even if you provide them with the MAC address to look up they still want visual confirmation.

                              <span>Hi community, I&#x27;m looking for a way to see if there&#x27;s any drop in a particular QoS queue in a P router associated to an uplink.
 The only command I&#x27;ve found is &quot;show pools network-egress  | match &quot;Queue : 6&quot; post-lines 13&quot; but unfortunately it doesn&#x27;t show the drop stats.
 In a PE the command &quot;monitor service id  sap 
 details&quot; worked but not in a P router since there&#x27;s no sap.
 Thanks

 Is there anything that Palo Alto is doing that comes close to justifying that it&#x27;s 10x more expensive?

                              <span>So we have 2 sites that are connected via dark fiber (10 Gig link) , on both sites we are using a Cisco 3850 switch. Dark fiber is being terminated on these switches in both sites.
 The routing is simple with a /30 mask being used and no ip switchport being configured on each dark fiber port on each switch. EIGRP is being used for routing.
 We use Solarwinds to monitor these devices.
 Now the problem is we are suddenly seeing issues on this dark fiber link starting today, was working fine until yesterday (last week there was a fiber cut which caused interruptions but has been working fine until yesterday since the fix). The port keeps flapping randomly every 30 minutes or so. Will go down for a few minutes say like 3 or 10 minutes at a time and will come back up.
 We opened a ticket with Comcast (dark fiber is from Comcast) and they sent someone to check the their equipment. He came checked within 15 minutes and determined it wasn&#x27;t an issue on their end then got an email from them saying that it could be an issue with sfps/bad jumpers.
 Now upon checking on solarwinds I see a bunch of receive errors today not necessarily coinciding with the flapping but I do see them. It&#x27;s about 10-18k received errors (only receive) on one of the switches (haven&#x27;t put the other 3850 switch into monitoring yet) and this was today. Until yesterday the received errors were just 198-200 or so.
 So could this be an sfp issue on this particular port? Could swapping out this 10Gig sfp fix the issue? Or could it be a different issue?
 Thank you.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve read through previous posts on the topic of traffic generators and I see iperf, ixia, cisco&#x27;s t-rex, etc mentioned a lot, but I need a little help understanding the physical component to running tests with traffic generators.
 For example, if I wanted to run a test of a rate-limit config on a given device and I decided to use iperf, I would need to physically connect a device with at least two NICs (or two different devices) to act as the client and server for the iperf test. The device I run iperf on would then generate the traffic for the test on one NIC and receive the traffic on the other NIC.
 If that&#x27;s correct, then it would logically follow that people often use servers - or any other computer with multiple NICs - to generate the traffic with their traffic generator of choice (…</span>

                              <span>So I have 1 Meraki proving internet to a switch in another department with in turn that switch feeds a third switch. When I check I get signal from the first to the second switch h and I can connect devices on the second switch no problem. Once I get to the 3rd one nothing just 169. I&#x27;ve traced the cables and they appear to have connectivity, what could be happening?
 Anything helps!
 Originally we thought we had a switch go out but now I don&#x27;t think so u wanna say it&#x27;s dhcp but when I look on firewall we don&#x27;t have that many wired devices and wireless are on a separate address range. So what could be interrupting between the second and third switch?

 Are fiber optic couplers compatible with singlemode, and multimode, OM1, and OM3? Basically are they just a physical interface that you don&#x27;t need to take those specs into account or not?

We will be throwing in a single C3850 for the time being and would like some insight on the routing setup…
  
Will A, B, and/or C work?
 
Pros/Cons of each method?
 
One of our customers will have a pair of pfsense firewalls in HA using CARP. Will it be easier to put two L2 ports into an SVI so each firewall gets an uplink directly from our router?

 Edit: some of these firewalls will be in a routed PO. If I’m setting “carrier-delay”, would I need to set it on the PO AND the interfaces associated with the PO?

One of our customers uses a web-based database that has stopped being accessible from their network. We run a Unifi firewall and are using Comcast - and the DB company is using Cloudflare for DNS and proxy. We&#x27;ve disable IDS, bounced the server/firewall/modem etc, and still get the message in the screenshot. However, there is one computer on the network that can access the site - using Chrome on the VMHost. Tried it in internet explorer on the VMHost - no joy. And no joy anywhere else. The database is generally accessible to the whole internet. DB provider swears they are not blocking our public IP. I&#x27;ve switched the DNS forwarder on the DC to use Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) I&#x27;m out of ideas, and the inter webs have no information on the source of this block message - I literally cannot find anything in google that tells me the source of it. Any ideas? Here&#x27;s a link to the screenshot: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wqn-1f57tppBIc1823tTakRjj9tv82fi/view?usp&#x3D;share\_link

I&#x27;ve troubleshot LANs where linux hosts had issues routing to their gateways, across backbones, or having issues with their TCP/IP stack. I&#x27;ve worked with project managers and apps/service/database teams to migrate/expand/shrink footprints within POPs.

                              <span>I was wondering if any of you still report IP abuse to corresponding ISPs? I have several security measures in place to circumvent botnet style forced attempts, but I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s worth my time to report abuse to the providers? 
 I don&#x27;t care to share much more information, but if you have reported to Service Providers what has been your experience?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a situation where I have a new Aruba 6000 uplinked to an HP 2610.
 The HP 2610 is a 10/100 (gross I know) and Aruba is gig.
 I added a new VLAN to the 2610 for management (VLAN 50), tagged it on the HP&#x27;s fiber uplink, then untagged it on the switchport I&#x27;m using to uplink to the Aruba 6000.
 The corresponding Aruba switchport is configured as an access port on VLAN 50. 
 As soon as I uplink them together, the HP freaks out and losses internet connectivity across the switch which is on VLAN 1.
 I also tried configuring the Aruba uplink port as a trunk with native vlan 50. 
 If I tag VLAN 50 and untag VLAN 1 on the HP, the switches work fine together. 
 I tested turning on loop-protect on the HP, which did not get triggered during my testing.
 It almost seems as though a broadcast storm is coming from the Aruba when the HP port in configured with an untagged VLAN 50 and connected to Aruba 6000. 
 I&#x27;ve also tried changing switch ports on both switches and changing auto-negotiate. 
 Any thoughts?

                              <span>Hi folks who have been in the industry for a long time and have familiarity with multiple vendors, which companies do you see increasing their market share and which ones loosing basically in the these 3 sectors? I have Cisco, Arista and Juniper in mind as these are the ones that compete mostly on the same geography):
 1. Data Center: I read Cisco is loosing big and Arista close to 50% of market share in the DC segment.
  
Enterprise
 
Service Provider: Cisco still leading?

 My work has me settings up large specialized computers which all need a connection to the network for an initial data configurations. Too often the staging area provided to me has inadequate ethernet available.

                              <span>Audio engineer looking for advice from networking engineer professionals. As the audio more and more relies on IP networks, I find myself seeking for advice from fellow network engineers. This time it is not directly connected to audio, only control of it. 
 I have this mixing console, that can be controlled via lan from iPad app. Although most of console manufacturers let us connect many iPads simultaneously, this particular manufacturer provides access from only one iPad at a time (limited via software), which is very unconventional. Is there a way to bypass this limitation using router? 
 My idea is that multiple iPads connect to router via wifi (wlan). 
 Router acts as a bridge (between wlan and eth) and routes traffic trough eth to mixing console. All outgoing eth traffic should come to console from same IP. 
 Console returns response trough eth to router.
 Router makes the response in to multicast and transmits it over bridged network to wlan for all wifi devices.
 ​
 Does this makes any sense? If so, could someone please get me on track on how to start googling it.
 Thank you!

 I have a Dell N3024 with the &quot;IP Routing&quot; option enabled. I have several VLANs, and every VLAN interface has an IP, and am wondering what happens when I don&#x27;t create an access list. Is all traffic between VLANs allowed? 
 Do I need to create ACLs per VLAN if I only want to allow outgoing traffic to WAN?

                              <span>Hi guys, i have just recently purchase a brand new ADVA FSP150-XG304 that has a network company name on. I am trying to console into it using the serial cable that came with the unit, and the settings normally used on other FSP150 (9600,8,none,none) however all i am getting back it some gibberish characters of 2 to 3 lines. When i try to press space bar, all i can see on screen is some dotted cubes appearing. Any idea how to solve this? Thanks. Daniel

                              <span>Hello everyone. I have a question related to Network and Wifi stuffs. I want to choose a pair of access point and sector antenna. The case is there are many UAVs in the air. They must send video packages to their GCS(Ground Control Station). So I want to choose a low-latency, long-range and powerful access point-sector antenna pair. Last year I used GrooveA 52 and mANTBox 19s. For Groove&#x27;s Antenna, I used FAT SHARK 5.8GHz antenna. But It didn&#x27;t work efficiently. That&#x27;s why I want to change with better one. So what do you recommend to me ?

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to get a snmp device simulator up and running to test some software. I found SNMP Agent Simulator, but I can&#x27;t get the simulated devices to be recognized by anything outside the program. They will only bind to a local host IP (127.0.0.1). I tried creating a virtual network using hyper-V, but no luck there either. Apparently not many people do this, because google is worthless (or I&#x27;m not searching the right thing since I&#x27;m new to this) I&#x27;m just trying to figure out how to simulate some SNP devices for testing network monitoring software. I&#x27;ll take any method that people have had success with.

                              <span>Hello guys,
 ​
 I&#x27;m a web / mobile developer, and on my current contract, my client ask me to prepare a quite huge setup, in a domain I&#x27;m not expert in, let me explain.
 ​
 The constraints of the app are:
 - We need 1 dedidacted server by country we implement the app, with it&#x27;s own independent database, with a lot of limitation because it&#x27;s for medical purpose (that&#x27;s why we need 1 server per country). So each server must have the same version of the back-end.
 - We need to extract some data&#x27;s from each server to make them anonymous and build worldwide stats, which needs to be accessible for any user.
 For the first point, I was thinking of simply open new VPS on a given country, and just deploy the last stable version of the backend, and link all of them across our DNS. But i&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s a good practice to have only 1 DNS server for people who want&#x27;s to access a server far from the DNS ? Don&#x27;t really know how does it works actually.
 For the 2nd point, i was thinking about a kind of proxy server, that put itself between the country server and the client, that will collect the anonymous data and store it in a separate database, and then duplicate and sync this server in the cloud to make it available all around the world ?
 ​
 My issues concern the stack i should use to make this kind of setup. My knowledge stop to NGINX, Docker &amp; Node.js to be quick, and that seems to involve more complicated stuff, so if you can point me to some docs and/or softwares that would works for my purpose ?
 ​
 Thanks guys

                              <span>Hi folks,
 I am looking for hardware for monitoring Wi-Fi.
 I know that there are professional solutions that test the Wi-Fi 24/7 with a &quot;client&quot; and record problems/latencies etc.
 I just want it to be a box that I can put in a place where I have problems. But I just can&#x27;t come up with the names and my Google searches have all gone nowhere so far.
 I also know of hobby projects or semi-professional projects with a Rasperry Pi.
 What solutions do you know?

                              <span>Hi all. Due to life changes, I decided to leave a job at a nonprofit that I’ve greatly enjoyed both the job and the purpose of the organization. I’ve been there many years and was the sole IT person for about 100 people. 
 We hired the only person who applied and he seemed underqualified but it could work. I planned my exit to work with him for a couple weeks and bring him up to speed. Something seemed off with him and I just realized today that it seems like he’s just going to use this gig to pad his resume. By itself wouldn’t be a huge concern but he’s planning some massive projects that will cost thousands of dollars that could otherwise be spent on the actual purpose of the org. Meanwhile he’s not considering some specific projects I’ve suggested that had been pushed back due to Covid and other restraints but certain outdated equipment is becoming a liability… just not a sexy project. 
 One project is upgrading the network to 10g when we barely make a dent in our 200mbps internet bandwidth. He’s done no research with staff or historical network usage to justify any of these projects. Unfortunately, no one else in the org understands IT and I’m not sure anyone will question these frivolous upgrades. 
 I’m debating whether or not I should bring this up with my former boss but I don’t want to get into a pissing match. I truly value the organization and the people there and it’s frustrating to see things going this route. 
 My thought would be to bring up my concerns and coach on what questions to ask. Basically why do we need this upgrade? What problem does it solve? And what data to look for as a justification. 
 Thoughts?

                              <span>I have a 4 foot by 2 foot closet serving as a server room. It has a 25u server rack and a 12u network rack laden with equipment. The heat really gets up there. 
 I found a youtube video where someone used a AC Infinity CLOUDLINE T6 fan to vent such a room through an intake register installed in the ceiling. The intake register connects to the fan, in the attic, and then the fan exhausts to the intake of the AC system for the property. Our local HVAC technician told me that it was a bad idea to have hot air running to the property intake when the system was not engaged, (actively cooling). I assumed he was right, but I could use a second opinion. 
 That being the case, I think I need an AC unit devoted to this room. I already have a 6&quot; intake grille installed in the ceiling and a 6&quot; vent installed in the ceiling that I can redirect to a new AC system. Is this what I really need? What AC system can I get for such a small space?

                              <span>Hello,
 I work at a SMB, our company spends a substantial amount of time and money on cyber security, however some simple things seem to be forgotten
 What are some simple things you’ve picked up or implemented along the way that contributes to an improved security posture overall?

                              <span>It looks like Microsoft is soon to launch their own backup serviece for M365 (email, sharepoint, onedrive). They put out a video today announcing the service, but details are scant.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working at a major O&amp;G company since mid-April. They originally wanted me to be FTE, but due to HR weirdness stuff on their end they switched it to contract. Pay was rather good, senior analyst position, yadda yadda.
 Been kicking some good ass since starting, getting good support in lots of areas, I was actually volunteering to significantly overhaul patching for Linux stuff (which people responded very positively to), and all sorts of other stuff.
 Fastforward to recent history. Company experienced extremely significant security breach (I can&#x27;t name names) and I was part of an unreal-huge effort to recover like... uhhh... amounts I can&#x27;t even comment on. Hell you might even have enough information in this post to semi-accurately speculate on whom, and to what extent of things..…</span>

 the process falls apart from a management standpoint of how to deal with repeat, habitual &quot;clickers&quot; . They&#x27;ve asked me to provide input, but i&#x27;m running out of options. cant really limit internet use or email flow, usb is already disabled. It appears that the managers talking to the employees isnt helping much either.
 trying to figure out what other methods you may have to used to reduce the security &quot;fail&quot; score of specific employees!

Second, to help commercial customers plan, we’re sharing that Microsoft 365 Copilot will be priced at $30 per user
  
So, for orgs using Microsoft 365 E3, to leverage Copilot you&#x27;ll be doubling your license spend per month per user who gets it. This is an awful price point.

                              <span>Hello! Long story short, the place i work for needs me to install a program called VeriAdmin from a company called bioscrypt, that manages fingerprints stores in a fingerprint scanner from the same comapny. The only issue is that Bioscrypt doesnt exist anymore, and after calling the company that absorbed them, i was told that they dont have that software anymore. Checking online, and there are no downloads of this software either (i did find one called secureadmin by the same company but its not the same software sadly)
 Anyways, we have one windows 10 computer where that software is installed and works on, but its due to be retired next week. i&#x27;ve tried to transfer over all the files, including the .dll&#x27;s and the registry keys from the working computer to a new one, but in the process of being transferred over to a flash drive, it immediatly loses some data, since the exe loses its icon and any information about it in properties. Despite this i try to run it on the new computer and it simply wont run either in compat mode, as administrator etc. 
 I ran procmonitor on the computer where it works and on the newer one to see what could be missing, and apparently, right after trying to QueryNameInfo a DLL thats stored in system32, it fails on the new computer, because on the new computer right after it starts a registry key named &quot;windows error reporting&quot;, while on the old one it just continues with opening the HKCU registry key. 
 I checked the DLL and theyre the exact same, with the same permissions, and everything else the same. Im not sure that this is the exact issue with the software, maybe something happens after it runs that DLL that doesnt show up on procmonitor, but if anyone could help me figure this out i would be very grateful. here is a screenshot of the procmonitor logs and i show where it fails (the new pc is on the left, the old one on the right): https://imgur.com/a/pVhHaQC
 again if anyone can help i would greatly appreciate it! thank you!

                              <span>Title asks the question. EVERYONE makes mistakes. The best own up to them and learn from them.
 I once deleted the entire badge reader database of whom was able to access a set of offices. That weekend I had to stay close to the office so I could help people get into the office by re-adding them to the database.
 The 2nd thing I did (LONG ago) was replacing a router and did a command similar to this:
 ip route 172.31.10.0 255.255.255.0 S0/1
 The problem - it was the wrong interface on the router. Should have been:
 ip route 172.31.10.0 255.255.255.0 S0/0
 All Internet traffic failed and while it took me only 5 minutes to realize that there was a problem and find my stupid error. How did I fix it? Swapped the cable from s0/1 to s0/0. I didn&#x27;t want to take a chance on fixing the configuration and break something else!

                              <span>So long story short we are moving 5 racks each with various equipment in them to a new data center in another area of the same building we are currently in. 
 How would you go about moving them? 
 The racks wheels are supposed to be rated to handle a full rack load and still work with no issue, so I thought just unhook everything from the other racks wrap up the loose cables lock the rack and start walking. 
 Or should we go through the hassle of undoing all cables, removing everything then reassembling at the new location?

                              <span>I have a closed space that is very particular about what is allowed to enter and exit. I have 1 DC (dell r240, 16gb ram, 1 tb m.2 C:) and 3 win 10 machines connected by a switch to a NAS. Prior to an inspection to see how we set up the server, we moved in the server and locked down group policy, doing group policy by myself for the first time was a bit of a mistake and it locked out the workstations usability with tough to find errors (couldn&#x27;t access file shares, couldn&#x27;t execute applications and domain admins couldn&#x27;t install around smart screen) after bringing in another tech who is cleared but not widely available. We agreed the DC needed to be rebuilt in the room a weekend before the inspection(dont really get a choice in inspection dates). Queue a long weekend and the DC was rebuilt …</span>

                              <span>Hi All,
 Simple task beating me down here. Moved FSMO roles to a new DC; all good. Trying to move time service and the old DC won&#x27;t let go. I have the new PDC/DC working and set the new tiem souce. Just looking around and some member servers are using the new one, some the old. I ran the command on the old dc to sync from DOMHIER and now it just wants to use the local clock. So it still seems to be advertising as a time source as well. Has anyone run in to this? The only thing I haven&#x27;t tried is a reboot but can&#x27;t right now...

                              <span>Hi all,
 I posted last night but deleted, needing a rethink of my question.
 I work for a very large government organisation, with several hundred thousand users and specifically oversee Exchange Hybrid and Exchange Online. We have a majority of our users in Exchange Online.
 We have a heap of projects lined up, with a few years worth of jobs. However, they&#x27;re all &#x27;keep the lights on&#x27; jobs - and I&#x27;d like to educate and inspire the masses to do more.
 I&#x27;d really like to start taking ideas to the business on how to innovate, whether it&#x27;s with Graph API, Flow, Power Automate, Teams or 3rd Party Addons. Even Outlook feature, or Outlook on the Web. Mobile client features? 
 I&#x27;m after some ideas of what people have done in their companies that people have found to have made a difference, or how you&#x27;ve &#x27;inspired&#x27; development of &#x27;solutions&#x27; using Exchange Online. Do you do training seminars?
 Essentially, I want to provide people with solutions to problems they didn&#x27;t know they had. I just don&#x27;t want to keep the lights on - I&#x27;d like to do more! (Even if it is with an old behemoth of a platform)
 Cheers!

                              <span>A client has a domain that has been parked for years, that they now want to use.
 They already host their own DNS for their primary domain, and want me to move the DNS on-prem.
 Thing is... I&#x27;ve never setup DNS from scratch.
 I added A records to the GoDaddy DNS.I added the server public IPs and host names in the Hostnames section of GoDaddy DNS. The configured Nameservers are still GoDaddy&#x27;s.
 At this point, the FQDN of the servers resolve to the correct IPs, but GoDaddy is still the source of the records.
 Next, I changed the Nameservers to the FQDN of the clients servers (same as already in DNS above). After an hour or so, the domain completely disappears from the internet.
 So, what am I doing wrong?

                              <span>We are currently running a single ESXi host with ~20 Linux VMs and already do have a vSphere 8 Enterprise Plus license.
 Very often we have to create VMs from scratch instead of templates which is very frustrating. Also we are missing a convenient way to backup our VMs which is why we are thinking about using vCenter.
 Would it be advisable to run vCenter on a VM inside the existing ESXi host or is this not something we should be doing? If so, why? I&#x27;m also thinking here about another hypervisor that we might want to deploy in the future.

 \ But sometimes it&#x27;s the &quot;hosts&quot;-file.*

 Remember that fellow sysadmins! It was for me today. 
 I almost forgot about the hosts-file today, but nothing else made sense except maybe a wierdly spesific firewall rule. Why is it always on the servers that vendors &quot;need&quot; access to?

                              <span>Multiple locations connected over IPSEC tunnel to HQ. All workstations Win10/11 using AD integrated DNS at HQ with second DNS 8.8.8.8. We&#x27;ve had this config for at least 10 years without issue. I know we should probably have local DNS servers at each site :( . Suddenly from remote sites we cannot ping DNS names but we can ping IP. DNS server IP is reachable but not by name. No issue at HQ, all DNS names resolve server.domain.local. DNS server logs are clean and it has been rebooted. Rebooting workstations or typing ipconfig/flushdns resolves the issue but only until the next morning when it starts again. Last week when it first started there was a single occurrence at one site. I found some old DNS records on our DNS server from a time when we had a different local subnet in a different building so DNS server had conflicting IP info and I deleted the old records which resolved the issue for 1 week. Now it&#x27;s back. Could it be a firewall issue? Not making any progress troubleshooting so far.

                              <span>I use the APCRBC123 battery with my SMT750RMI2U and it just died on me this week. I&#x27;m looking to replace it with a third party battery if possible as the APC batteries are over-priced.
 After doing some research I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people suggesting third party batteries for UPS. My model apparently uses a proprietary connector which I have from the old battery pack: https://imgur.com/a/YOWLqmC
 Will I be able to connect 7Ah 12v third party batteries to this? My UPS model supports hot-swap so I&#x27;m assuming I connect the third party batteries to the connector and plug-in as normal. I want to be 100% sure so I&#x27;m not wasting my time. I&#x27;ve never had to replace a UPS battery until now.
 If I can buy third party batteries what are the best brands (I&#x27;m in the U.K), or does this not matter?

                              <span>So one of my customer needed 1 licence Windows server 2022, and we bought him a 16 core 2 pack we checked the licensing and that part is fine
 But after I checked the VM currently installed (yes should&#x27;ve done that first) and I saw that they had 1 extra VM that &#x27;Wasn&#x27;t legit&#x27; they were licensed for 6 Windows server 2019 and they had 7, so I said well the windows server 2022 2 pack will cover the 2019 and the extra 2022, but then I wasn&#x27;t sure if it would work.
 ​
 So my questions is
 Since licences are usually downgrable
  
Am I fine audit wise with the 2 pack Windows 2022 saying that 1 will be used for the 2019 and one for the 2022
 Do I need if it&#x27;s possible to separate my 2 pack and downgrade one code to 2019?
 Do I need to upgrade one of my 2019 to 2022 to be legit
  
Thanks

 Edit : every licence is STD there is no Datacenter

                              <span>There seems to be an issue with Windows 11 and the Ricoh MP C3504ex printer. When printing from Windows 10, there are no problems, but when using laptops with Windows 11 (22H2), the connection window stays for several minutes before the printer starts printing. Printing through the server or manually adding the printer using its IP address doesn&#x27;t change anything. I&#x27;ve tried different drivers, spooler reset. I&#x27;m at my wit&#x27;s end. Please provide suggestions.

                              <span>I need to replace the aging 2 node hyper-v cluster i inherited, running 2012r2 on 2* hpe dl380 g8 and a hpe msa 2040 san with about 8tb on spinning rust. For little bit of background: Workload is about 8 vms including a 2019 windows fileserver for mainly CAD related files. We have around 35 Users, all on premise. Budget is tight...
 My plan so far would be: 2* custom build servers ( with 5 year next-day onsite support): 2HE with 8 * hotswap bays Supermicro h12ssl-i mainboard Epyc 7343 cpu with 256gb ram 2* 240 sata ssd for os 5* 3,8tb sata ssd for storage 10gbit dual-port intel nic for cluster/vsan network Those would be around 8500$ each
 Starwind vSAN to replace the MSA and replicate Storage between the nodes.
 Question is this feasible? Use hardware raid 5 ( with a broadcom megaraid 9560-8i) for the local storage or maybe storage spaces instead? Is storage space parity mode still bad ?

                              <span>Hi all,
 we just set up Windows Hello for Business with Kerberos Cloud trust in our Hybrid Environment.Our Administrators are using two accounts: One without admin privileges and one with admin privileges in EntraID.
 They are logged into their devices with the non-admin account and have setup WHfB with this account on the device and are able to log into portal.office.com with WHfB in a private browser session (for testing to prevent SSO).
 We would like to set up their EntraID admin-accounts with WHfB on the same device, to log into entra.microsoft.com with WHfB - so they can choose with which account they log into the microsoft service - does anybody if and how this is possible?
 Edit: Previously we used Yubikeys: Both accounts are present on the key and the user can choose in the windows security login screen what account should be used for the login.

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 I have a customer who has bought an ultrawide monitor to use on his gliding setup (planes without engines), however the software that is built into the monitor itself only supports splitting itself into 2 separate screens
 Does anyone know of any software that will split the screen 3 ways, but also get Windows display manager to see 3 separate screens? Would also need to be able to set custom resolutions to each section
 Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, everything I&#x27;ve found so far can split the screen however it doesn&#x27;t list them as separate screens within Windows display manager

 For a specific need, we need to run a NIVIDIA A4000 with DDA in a VM RDSH with HYPER V.
 Any feedback? We can&#x27;t get a vGPU driver, so we have to use a Quadro. The Quadro RTX 4000 and P4000 are obsolete, so we want to use an RTX A4000. 
 Server HPE ML350 Gen 10 - CPU 1X Intel XEON SILVER 4210 R
 Has anyone done this before? Does it work?
 Thanks

 I made sure we have all the prerequisites and have set Telemetry as required. We do not have a Windows Fo Business settings catalog policy but have updates rings(that work) with driver updates set to allowed but no driver updates to review after 3 weeks.

 Before I joined, it was decided to block all USB keys. When someone wants to recover files, I have to unblock them through our MSP (because I don&#x27;t have yet control of the AV but that&#x27;s another story).
 This makes sense to me because USB keys are still a large vector for viruses, however it&#x27;s taking me at least twice a week to unlock some ports after I checked the key myself on a separate isolated machine.
 I would need your input regarding this. What makes sense to you regarding USB keys : should they be completely blocked, what process do you have in place ?

                              <span>Hello,
 Our company is considering migrating our email and IT tools to Microsoft 365. Currently, we use our own servers for email, but we would like to transfer the domain to Microsoft. Additionally, for certain users, we are purchasing Microsoft 365 Apps for Business licenses, including Office apps, etc. We currently have 35 such users, but during the migration, we will need around 50 users immediately, and within a year, the number may exceed 100 as we expand into international markets (we already have open companies in Spain, Portugal, Austria, Poland, etc.).
 As the company is present in multiple markets, the plan is to have all admin.microsoft processes executed in the main company, while in foreign countries, there will be the option to only add/remove users with licenses.
 For optimal operation, we would require a plan similar to what Microsoft 365 Business Standard offers at €11.70 per license/month. I&#x27;m wondering if you have any other suggestions for optimizing the company&#x27;s operations with this number of users?
 Additional questions:
 What is the management principle for &quot;aliases&quot; on Microsoft servers? Are aliases free?
 In the case of a business relationship, do they provide training for administrators, and do they offer technical support in case of any issues?
 Thank you for your assistance and looking forward to your responses.

                              <span>So at the moment I have OneDrive for Business - On my laptop and I have folders setup to be shared to specific users in the business. All computers use 2FA login and disk encryption btw. This works great as most people are remote and it all syncs and works as it should. We used a NAS in the past, but it was slow over the VPN and just wasn&#x27;t the right solution.
 The problem I&#x27;ve got now is as users add into their shared folders, it saves a copy on my PC, which means I need to upgrade my storage. I&#x27;d rather not do that and need to look at an alternative way of doing things with OneDrive.
 One option I looked at was the plugin for our QNAP NAS called Hybrid Backup Sync. Does anyone know if this will do what I need - basically move all of the files from my OneDrive onto the NAS, and then share the folders etc that way (through OneDrive still)? Keeping my PC free of files that only I need etc.

                              <span>Unfortunately, PostgreSQL is not very well implemented in working with temporary tables. Even when a temporary table is very small and can be processed exclusively in memory, PostgreSQL creates one or more files for each such table. And this happens even at each TRUNCATE of a temporary table. 
 However, PostgreSQL allows you to create all temporary tables in a separate tablespace, which allows you to move all the files to a separate disk. As a result we have : 
  
A separate disk that has exactly one folder that holds 500K files at all times.
 Of these 500K files, 99% of the files are either empty or less than 16K in size.
 There is constant active creation and deletion of new files.
 Reliability is completely unimportant. At any time you can delete the entire contents of the disk and re-create an empty folder.
  
At the moment we use ext4 file system. Even a simple reading of the list of files in a folder can take 1-2 seconds. When analyzing with the perf utility, a lot of time is spent on ext4_lookup, ext4_create.
 Which file system is best suited for this task ?

                              <span>Found thisold 3PAR SAS SSD. What is this connector on the back and what is it used for? Looks like mini-HDMI to me.
 I failed to find anything on Google... HP part number 804170-001. More details in picture.
 Just curious about this seeming oddity.

                              <span>I have an issue where I cannot get an new Dell precision 3581 to image using SCCM. We usually have a fleet of Latitudes that we image and all of them can image without any issues. I have updated the WinPE drivers as well as got the latest drivers from Dell.
 The Machine Joins the Domain and as soon as it hits the installing application looses internet and does not have an IP. I can’t export the logs after failure because the machine doesn’t get any IP .
 We also use ACHI mode for the HD so the intel storage drivers are not the issue , this has been a predominant problem with our Latitude fleer
 Has anyone got the imaging for the precision to work ? I’m running out of ideas about what I can do

 Visual C++ 2013 dependency (why so old)
 Client installs in C:\randomdir (now I&#x27;ve got to create new Applocker rules)
  
Why? Why can&#x27;t billion dollar companies create applications that don&#x27;t suck. Sorry for the rant. I feel a little better.

                              <span>I have an old 2012R2 server network that has two servers, a 2012R2-DC and 2012R2-Application running on the old .local domain setup.
 I figure a simple migration of the DC and Application server to 2022 is easy. But am I still able to join Server 2022 standard to .local domains?
 However, my gut feeling is I should just bite the bullet and build a new ad.domain.com and rebuild the whole network.
 What do you guys recommend?

I let them know about all the troubleshooting performed, and that the fault is without a doubt, pointing to the NIC. Dell decides to set up a labor only dispatch, which threw me into a argument about how much of a waste of time that would be if/when we found out the NIC needed to be replaced. 
 But then, on another day, I get a Dell technical support engineer that gives zero push back, no nonsense, and gets the job done quick and painlessly.

 2cpu, 16GB Ram. 
 Random failures. Usually mondays of course. Found a few driver mismatches, fixed. Random fails still happening. Most drivers are type 3. Some are older drivers which I suspect to be the main issue. 
 My inclination is to build new 2022 server similar specs, all type 4 drivers if available. We already pretty heavily use universal drivers for HP, Canon, Ricoh, other big names. Still have some model specific drivers for the smaller brands. 
 Thoughts? Managed print via printer logic or azure not really an option yet.

                              <span>I just got bit by this - CrowdStrike pushed out a new update today to some of our Falcon deployments. Our security team handles these so I wasn&#x27;t privy to it.
 All I know is, half of our production MSSQL hosts and clusters started crashing at the same time today.
 I tracked it down after rebooting into safe mode and noticing that Falcon had an install date of today.
 The BSOD Error we were seeing was: DRIVER_OVERRAN_STACK_BUFFER
 I was able to work around this by removing the folder C:\Windows\System32\drivers\CrowdStrike
 Contacted CrowdStrike support and they said they were aware an update had been having issues and were rolling it back. 
 Not all of our systems were impacts but a few big ones were hit and it&#x27;s really messed up my night.

                              <span>I&#x27;m about to replace a 5 year old Windows 10 Dell Optiplex that was used as a file server for a small business. They are a design firm with 12 employees with ~1.3tb of used storage. This would be my first server replacement and would appreciate some feedback. The existing servers were installed by their previous IT vendor and i&#x27;m looking for some recommendations on how to go about this upgrade.
 Their current setup:
  
Domain Controller - Windows Server 2016 (planning to replace after the file server)
 Used for very basic AD functions and DNS. Pretty much just used for creating users and authenticating them to the domain, no complex policies or in depth configurations.
 File Server - Dell Optiplex, Windows 10, 8gb ram, single 4tb hard drive (NO raid /facepalm)
  
I am looking to replace both machines, starting with the file server. The budget is about $3,000 for each machine. Their are a design firm and use Revvit / Autocad, thus cloud solutions are not viable, they store the projects on the file server and access them in office, beyond that its a very simple setup.
 This is what i&#x27;m looking at for the file server:
 Dell PowerEdge R250 / T150 Tower
  
Windows Server Essential 2022
 Intel Xeon E-2334
 16GB / 32GB RAM
 2x 4TB enterprise SSD - Raid 1 for data
 512GB SSD for OS
 10GB network card
  
Does this look ok? Are SSDs overkill for this? I&#x27;m thinking of purchasing the basic ram/HD options from Dell and purchasing upgraded ram &amp; hard drives for the items listed above since Dells upgrade prices are pretty significant. I want to set them up for success and considering they are using a consumer Dell PC with Windows 10 for their file server, anything would be an upgrade to their current setup.
 Thanks

 Bricking printers when CC expires. WTF we need to boycott this company
 My personal experience after running into so many bricked HPs printers many years ago was to put it on a vlan with no internet access. Amazingly those HP printers did not brick themselves. This was many many years ago and they may have changed to where if it can’t phone home it might just auto brick. 
 The only good HP product I used was Nimble and that’s not even an HP product, they just bought them out.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently managing a network with around 60 machines spread across different data centers worldwide. My primary service providers are Hostwinds and DigitalOcean, along with nodes at customer sites. I&#x27;ve been using tinc VPN (https://tinc-vpn.org/) to establish connectivity between these nodes, but I believe that I may be reaching the limits of its scalability. In addition, I want to connect our office network to this cloud network, and tinc is not readily available in most commercial firewall solutions.
 I have been looking into Netmaker which seems promising with its incredible transfer speed but I’m keen to hear your opinions about this. I like ZeroTier which works well despite dynamic IPs but I’m concerned with its speed as I continue to scale up. 
 IPSec is another alternative, but to be honest, I am not sure if this is the right solution either. I suspect someone has done something similar, and if so, I would really appreciate any expertise you could share with me.

                              <span>You gotta love it when one of your guys decides to tempt fate at 4pm on a Friday.
 Did &quot;a simple RAM upgrade&quot; on a customers server
 Turns out the server was a ticking time bomb. Some other consulting company had come in there and installed a bunch of garbage on the Hyper-V host directly that was murdering the performance and preventing the VMs from starting on boot.
 I sure do love cleaning up someone else mess!
 DC booted up with a disconnected network adapter and was in safe mode, so no DNS or DHCP for the rest of the network. None of the services on the app servers or SQL would start properly.
 3 hours later the VMs finally finished booting up in a healthy state and got their evening shift able to work.
 Then we had to stay up till 2am working remotely to fix their backups, patch woefully out of date servers, upgrade the RAM of the VMs to fix a nasty paging issue, fixed underlying storage issues, etc etc
 What a mess
 Glad we got the customer in a better state now, but &quot;there&#x27;s no such thing as a quick 20 minute upgrade on a Friday&quot;

                              <span>Hi Sysadmins,
 I&#x27;m sure this is a quarterly question in this forum and I&#x27;ve been reading some other threads as well, but wanted to see if there is anything new out there.
 We are investigating options to move from our DFS servers which are nearing OS EOL and in general they need to be reworked since they were built with 15 year old best practices. We current have multiple DFS servers in different geographical offices that replicate using DFS-R and then we use a software called PeerLock to handle file locking within the replication groups. This has been pretty solid but our initiatives are to move to cloud-based services. Whether it&#x27;s SharePoint, Azure File Services, Egnyte or something else, that&#x27;s yet to be determined.
 Some other info - 100% Windows clients, having mobile app access would be a plus, but not a requirement. Whether mapped drive or sync client is fine, we will need our users to rework files since we have an Excel linking problem, sheets linking to sheets, to sheets, to sheets, back to original sheet, and more sheets. Total storage need would be 15 TB initially. We also have folder overrun so we would definitely run into length issues in a SharePoint.
 I&#x27;m wondering what folks have turned to as their next version of file services in distributed offices that is as cloud-first as possible and what issues, caveats, or reviews you have.
 Thanks!

                              <span>We are currently using AWS S3 to store long term files that we need every so often (log files, snapshots of DB&#x27;s etc). AWS is 0.023 per GB and it seems that BackBlaze is a lot cheaper. We do not need any of the big bells and whistles. We need to be able to use the AWS S3 commands to send files to aws and every so often download them as needed. Would BackBlaze be enough? Any replace their S3 storage with BB? I want to avoid minimum fee&#x27;s like Wassabi since we mostly keep files for under 30 days.

 Also, how do I go about doing this? I&#x27;m just so lost with this one and need some help.

 I&#x27;ve been trying to setup an activity alert on 365 defender for when the password of our emergency admin account either changes or has been reset, but it doesn&#x27;t seem to be working.
 I have the activities as &quot;Reset user password&quot; and &quot;Change user password&quot; and I have the user set as our emergency account. I&#x27;ve tried multiple times to both reset it and change it but I&#x27;m not getting any alerts for it. I have set up an alert for when the account logs in, so I know that it at least partially works..
 Has anyone had similar troubles with setting up alerts? Any solutions?
 Thanks !

                              <span>I work at a small company where our MSP does the more technical admin / domain management processes while I coordinate and handle long-term projects.
 They stated cleaning up the old mailboxes would be a small project, taking their techs about 4 hours. I asked for permission to do it myself and did it in 2 minutes on the exchange admin portal?
 I filtered by shared and deleted the shared mailboxes that I had confirmed staff no longer needed prior to requesting this, and literally checked down a list and deleted them all at once.
 Am I missing something? Was this a 4-hour project?
 Appreciate insight.

 I ran into a problem today that I couldn&#x27;t use my VPN with Forticlient. After much research I realised that the problem was Windows update KB2693643, which is associated with RSAT. Is there any way to have RSAT and FortiClient running on the same machine without VPN issues?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Does anyone else use Ivanti Endpoint for their patch management? For almost a month now we have not been able to download the latest windows patches from them. Their support has been very vague saying they have a few customers with the same issue but will never give us any more info or an ETA. We have tried to escalate with our rep with no help. 
 I was just curious if anyone else uses ivanti endpoint and has the same issues. We are beginning to run into a time crunch this month as we have assessed windows patches we cannot deploy on our critical assets.

                              <span>My understanding is that using SMS as your 2-factor makes you vulnerable to &quot;SIM swapping&quot; but a hacker in possession would still need both your login and your password. If you&#x27;ve been SIM swapped, you would know it immediately because your phone would stop working. This is a quick alert for you to take action.
 So, they need three (or two if you think about it) things: your SMS, and your login/password. That&#x27;s not so easy, and if you safeguard both, you should be fine............ right?????? 
 Banks nowadays also don&#x27;t make it easy for hackers.

                              <span>Hi there. We are running a Exchange 2019 on premise, Users get syncd per AD connect (Hybrid). Users are running Microsoft E3 License. In the last 1-2 months all our users lost their Calendar one by one. As of now, no one has their calendar in teams anymore. We didnt change anything in our config in the last few months. Im a bit at a loss atm and would really appreciate some new input. Things i already did: O365 Support (useless) Mircosoft paid Exchange Server Support(still ongoing, seems equally useless atm.) All the Microsoft threads regarding Teams Calendar troubleshooting. The connection test from Microsoft. Its telling me it cant reach the mailbox. Same in the Teams logs:
 &quot;userPropertiesSettings&quot;: { &quot;value&quot;: { &quot;mailboxDiscoverableStatus&quot;: &quot;Undiscoverable&quot;, &quot;autodiscoverSettings&quot;: { &quot;ews&quot;: { &quot;mailboxStatus&quot;: &quot;Undiscoverable&quot; }, &quot;rest&quot;: { &quot;mailboxStatus&quot;: &quot;Undiscoverable&quot;, &quot;mailboxDiscoverabilityError&quot;: { &quot;errorCode&quot;: &quot;CalendarEventsFetchFailed&quot;, &quot;errorMessage&quot;: &quot;Could not fetch calendar events from the user exchange mailbox endpoint retuned by AutoDV2.&quot;, &quot;exceptionMessage&quot;: &quot;Failed to execute Office365 backend request GetCalendarViewRequest_User. Request Method: GET, Response Status Code: Unauthorized, Response Error Code: , Response Error Message: &quot;, &quot;protocolType&quot;: &quot;REST&quot; } } }, &quot;exchangeRecipientType&quot;: &quot;MailUser&quot;
 I dont know how i can tell Teams how to reach the exchange on premise mailbox.
 Teams is our only affected service. Everything else works perfectly fine. My current thinking: We dont synchronise the Mailbox GUID through Azure AD Connect so Teams thinks the user does not have a mailbox and stops looking. But shouldnt the autodiscover refer the Teams Mailbox inquiry towards our exchange server?
 Would really appreciate some new directions where i can look :(

While I have numerous tasks to keep me occupied, I am eager to bring innovation and fresh ideas to the organization, specifically in the context of Exchange Online.
 Although other teams are responsible for managing various components of Office 365, we do collaborate with them. I am seeking suggestions and ideas to drive innovation within our Exchange Online environment.
 It&#x27;s an old, lumbering behemoth that doesn&#x27;t have the glammer of other products - so I&#x27;m trying to look at options for time or money saving solutions.
 Have you done or seen anything that is thinking outside the box? I&#x27;d love to hear about it.

 I&#x27;m a relatively new admin at this company after working helpdesk here for many years. I&#x27;ve been tasked with overhauling our DHCP design which has survived several OS/hardware upgrades over the years, but has kept the same overall layout. Some quick background on the company:
 This is a medium sized company based out of City 1. City 1 has two offices A and B separated by about 20 miles with a dedicated fiber line between them. There&#x27;s two other small sales offices in cities 2 and 3 with VPN connections to office A. Our setup is configured with two physical domain controllers both running split scope DHCP out of office A and B, some other physical servers are represented in both offices, but office A houses our virtual environment. In the remote sales offices there&#x27;s just a handfu…</span>

                              <span>Analyst/IT PM here. Consulting the sysadmin hive mind because I&#x27;m the village idiot when it comes to troubleshooting. I know I know, living up to the stereotype. 
 Been WFH since March 2020. I work for a huge company within the financial services industry. Having some frustrating/peculiar tech issues. 
 TL,DR: Can&#x27;t log into my work&#x27;s system, nor several other sites, like Hulu, from my (secure) WiFi network at home. However, I CAN log into my work&#x27;s system and Hulu when using my Mobile Hotspot. I had zero issues on Friday, no hiccups. When I went to try both sites yesterday, neither worked. I should (hopefully) be fine using my Hotspot for the day, but obviously I can&#x27;t/don&#x27;t want to be using my Hotspot indefinitely. There was a very brief power outage over the weekend in my house (IDK if it affected my whole town or neighborhood, or if it was just my house), but everything came back on within like ~30 seconds. I doubt that had anything to do with it, but IDK. 
 Thoughts? Ideas? Recommendations? Any DIY troubleshooting I can try? I&#x27;ve submitted a support ticket for my work-side, but IDK how much they&#x27;ll be able to help, since I&#x27;m technically still able to access their network from my HotSpot, i.e. I doubt they are the root cause of the issue. Thank you in advance for any feedback or guidance.

                              <span>We&#x27;re currently migrating from one MDM to Intune. As part of this we&#x27;ve unenrolled all of our devices from our current MDM, however quite a few are still showing as Enrolled within the old solution within Windows which then blocks Intune from registering the device.
 Does anyone have any scripts to reset the MDM assignment within Windows?
 Really want to avoid going to 140 devices to do this via the GUI.

                              <span>Hi,
 I am a junior sysadmin at a small company. At the moment, we are running on prem windows servers, and have to restart them every weekend, so theiy would make updates (i am planning with Linux and VM services). 
 Unfortunately, the windows server 2016 sometimes is not in reach with ping and other services are technically running on the server, but won&#x27;t come through to the clients. But remote access is still working.
 Any idea where this problem could come from? Should I restart the AD at another time? The AD is also on prem, in the same subnet.

                              <span>Has anyone else noticed a big uptick in GMail servers rejecting mail?
 I have senders getting messages rejected quite often now, even though we have the &quot;correct&quot; email setup (dkim/dmarc etc) and other domains that are non Gmail are fine. The issue I face is that not everyone has an email administrator at their disposal and some small companies have zero clue in how to add an accepted domain.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have externally hosted cloud application wanting to send external SMTP on my organizations behalf.
 As summary , We use an external company, who have built and also host a web portal for us, with the web portal being hosted on a Linux server. The web portal used to connect to our Exchange Onprem, through a user account we setup, to send out emails to everyone (Internal or External ) from e.g. portal@company.com email address.
 AFAIK , I will use HAT Policy (allowing sender public IP address). I don&#x27;t have any experience. How can I do that ?
 Also , I want to use SMTP Authentication. I will create new mailbox user on Exchange Server. My external app will this mailbox for relay.
 My environment : 
 Mx Records :
 smtp.company.com
 smtp2.company.com
 Cisco IronPort (Incoming and outgoing mail flow)
 Exchange Server 2013

 This domain is managed by the provider OVH. 
 Clients can’t mail to gmail etc .. but can receive

 What the fuck I need to do to delist it ?

 Currently tasked with setting a new GPO to install a set of fonts to user machines as well as setting those fonts as default for Office Applications.
 I&#x27;ve done my research and the irritating thing is I keep finding mixed information.
 I was wondering if any of you guys could share your experience with this or locate me towards a link which has worked for yourselves?
 Appreciate it!

                              <span>So, we are a small organization within a larger organization, and our MSP has filed bankruptcy, and will be shutting down their hosting environment 1st of August.
 We are a small team of 10 people, and the only thing left at the MSP is our file server with Veeam backup and a print server running (with Universal Print connector).
 I was first told that it would be shutting down later this year, so I haven&#x27;t really prepared anything.
 However, I need to find and setup a new solution within the next two weeks. But what is the best option? We are used to having network drives pinned, and I have no experience with Sharepoint. To my understanding, Sharepoint shouldn&#x27;t be treated as a file server, but I might be wrong.
 What is the best solution? A local file server with local or online backup? Sharepoint? something else?
 We all have AADJ devices and are running Intune, and we only have around 300 GB data.
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hey all, good day.
 It&#x27;s time for the annual inventory of the IT&#x27;s hardware again.
 I&#x27;m in a organization with ~200 users. Since last year more than 50% of it was upgraded into new specs and I didn&#x27;t took note every time I deployed one (yep, my bad). The previous IT guy used CPU-Z in each of the user&#x27;s unit then jotted it down then compile it which I think will take a little bit of time. I now wonder if you use any software like Advanced IP Scanner but for the hardware-side monitoring or should I prepare myself to go to each and every one of them users.
 Thank you y&#x27;all.

                              <span>I have two file servers + storage servers (all VMs running Windows Server 2022). I&#x27;ve successfully shared iSCSI vhdx from one of the storage servers to the two file servers and they&#x27;re running in a file-share cluster/failover cluster configuration.
 Now I&#x27;d like to set up the storage servers in a failover configuration as well, but I&#x27;m unable to get it working. The main problem I&#x27;m having is I can&#x27;t get any shared storage (the iSCSI vhdx) from either of the storage servers showing in the failover cluster manager, so I&#x27;m unable to create the new iSCSI Target Cluster role.
 I tried following this guide: https://www.informaticar.net/create-iscsi-target-cluster-on-windows-server-2019/ but keep running into different issues. Either the iSCSI vhdx from the second storage server doesn&#x27;t show up, or when I add the node to the cluster it says there&#x27;s no cluster group name etc. 
 Does anyone have experience with this? I find almost all resources about this online are lacking in information.

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 We are currently in the process of upgrading our 2012 servers. I am currently working on an old fileserver. 
 The issue is, there is a lot of macros coded to save files to specific folders on this server. I am not myself an expert on this subject of macros so I kindly ask for you assistance.
 When I update the server, will the macros break, or is there any way they will stay working if I can create the new server with exactly the same name? 
 I would have love to shut down this server entirely since I already moved most of it to the cloud, the only reason it&#x27;s still hanging is because of the macros.

When I checked on the shadow copies windows display, the C, D and E driver for the next run time was disable. When checking in system properties, I noticed that the system protection tag wasn’t in the system properties. I assumed that it has been disable. I have no idea what has been triggered to create the shadows copies and whether it is saved to delete the files in the folder. Need advise.

                              <span>Hi All,
 Any Riverbed Steelconnect peeps about?
 I&#x27;m currently migrating an SDWAN away from the legacy Steelconnect platform and have an Azure instance. Before I try to un-deploy I&#x27;m wanting to confirm that &quot;un-deploy&quot; will not remove my VNET it is attached to? As I believe this would result in VMs attached to the VNET needing to be re-deployed...
 My gut says no it won&#x27;t, that would be stupid, but I&#x27;ve seen enough stupid decisions in deployment wizards in my time to want confirmation... :)
 I&#x27;ve looked into the deployment doc and as far as un-deploy goes it just mentions it will kick off a confirmation, but not what the process will actually remove. As I was not the one to deploy, and it was deployed in 2020, I&#x27;m not 100% sure whether it created the vNET or not. I can confirm the Enterprise app has &quot;owner&quot; permissions on it however.

                              <span>Hi folks,
 My company is migrating from Trellix ETP to Microsoft ATP/EOP Spam Filter. I have an exchange hybrid instance and all my mailboxes are in the cloud. I&#x27;ve reviewed the documentation below and I&#x27;m stumped about what to do with the inbound connector:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/security/office-365-security/migrate-to-defender-for-office-365-setup?view&#x3D;o365-worldwide#step-4-configure-enhanced-filtering-for-connectors 
 It says to enable &quot;Enhanced Filtering&quot; on my existing inbound &quot;Partner&quot; ETP connector. That&#x27;s all well and good if I&#x27;m keeping ETP but I&#x27;m not. So the connector will stop working when I update my MX records.
 Apparently Exchange Online can just receive external emails without needing an inbound connector? Has anyone dealt with this situation before?
 I&#x27;m extremely need to Microsoft ATP/EOP Spam Filter so be gentle ;)
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hello guys,
 ​
 currently i am looking for a solution to shrink a few vhdx-files from fslogix users. i startet with the defaultsize of 30GB and now i wanted to shrink them to 2GB. i have also set the size for new fslogix containers via GPO to 2GB. FYI: I also use FolderRedirect.
 ​
 I tried to shrink the vhdx via the hyperv feature resize-vhd (i also had to shrink the used size of the vhdx via diskpart) . This works when i attach the vhdx via diskpart - i tested it with a skrink from 30GB to 10GB. But when i loged in with that user the VHDX size is still 30GB.
 I copied the vhdx to the right place and also deleted the proxy and cache folder for this user.
 ​
 I also know the solution with frx.exe, but this isn&#x27;t the best solution for me because of the broken permissions.
 ​
 Does anyone has an idea how i can shrink the vhdx with hyperv so that fslogix show the correct size?
 ​
 This would help me a lot
 Thanks

                              <span>I began my journey into getting qualified to be a System Administrator with short courses and certification. It feel like I need to know something about all aspects of ICT. 
 The courses I decided to go with are: CompTIA 1. Network+ 2. Security+ 3. Server+
 Introduction courses on Udemy for 1. Linux 2. PowerShell 3. Active Directory 4. SQL Basics
 Does going down this path make sense, I feel it&#x27;s more generalized then specialized.

                              <span>I have old Lenovo Laptops that I did fresh windows 10 installs on and they refuse to connect to the company&#x27;s WIFI network. It connects to other networks fine but this network which uses wpa2 enterprise won&#x27;t work. I want them to connect to the network so i can add them to the domain but no luck...
 It&#x27;s supposed to prompt for a User/Pass when you connect but it doesn&#x27;t prompt and just goes straight to trying to connect and then &quot;Can&#x27;t connect to this network&quot;
 I tried multiple driver versions and I tried manually adding the network with WPA2 enterprise auth and nothing seems to work.
 ​
 I don&#x27;t think the issue is from the network, it&#x27;s from the laptops and I&#x27;m not sure why

 I am a bit confused if Third Party Security Assessment (TPSA) is the same as how you guys are implementing ISO27001?
 I have been answering a lot of TPSA with my current company as their IT Manager and find it very tedious and time consuming :D But I learned a lot about the security gaps we need to improve on our security posture.
 Not sure how to implement ISO27001 in here. Can someone please guide me on how does this ISO27001 looks like when you start implementing?

                              <span>I have several wireless captures taken with my Aircheck G3 that gives me access to capture all of the frames being sent on a channel, including management and control frames.
 I am intending to determine the amount of airtime that beacons are consuming. From the captures, I already know that about 40% of the frames captured are beacons, but I want to determine how much actual airtime this corresponds to.
 I know beacons are transmitted at the slowest mandatory data rate, and I know the frame size. But I don&#x27;t think the airtime calculation is as simple as the frame size divided by the data rate (with the appropriate unit conversions between bytes and Mbps, of course), because I know the bits can be packed into higher MCS indexes / QAM encodings. (Or, am I thinking about this backwards, whereas a 24 Mbps data rate is the what you get at a fixed MCS / QAM?)
 So, in summary - with access to the PHY and MAC layers from an 802.11 capture, can I calculate airtime consumed for each frame? Or is there not enough info in a frame?
 This is in an 802.11ax network, btw, and I know it can get even more tricky with OFDMA&#x27;s resource unit allocations, which I don&#x27;t see any evidence of in the frame dumps.

 Is the RTG concept just a Juniper thing? I tried to look it up quickly and see if there was anything out there for the term in Cisco land or otherwise and didn&#x27;t find a whole lot. I have never heard of it before today. 
 Does anyone actually use that over STP? I&#x27;m trying to figure out why anyone ever actually would do so. If you are using RTG instead of STP, can you tell me why please?

                              <span>In the Nokia 7750 SR12 (SROS 21.x), is the bridge-domain feature the correct option to bind multiple L2 interfaces to a single L3 interface (we need to bind multiple VLANs to a subscriber L3 interface). We have tested this with a 7750 w/ older line cards running 14.x, but the commands don’t seem to work on the newer one, and we don’t have a lot of experience with Nokia (we’ve run Ericsson SEOS routers for years). I can’t even figure out how to install a license in 21.x. TYIA, I hope this makes sense.

                              <span>I have 10 switchs connected and all users on the same network.
 I´&#x27;m working on the new config and at this moment I´´&#x27;m stuck on how to provision all switchs without get kicked on the first one of them.
 Here are some questions I have to solve before start this process because all switchs are far away between them:
  
Is there a best way to start configuring ? from the last switch or start from the first switch connected to my router ?
 Best practices for avoid get kicked and need to be in the place connected over rs232 ?
 I will be configuring the switch over the same port whose will be the trunk port. I need to change the port to trunk and put the new management vlan. Can i do this without being disconnected ? or it&#x27;s better to stay with mgmt vlan on 1 and then make the change ? 
  
​
 Thanks for your time!

                              <span>Hi!
 Looking at two options for new network hardware for a customer. Want to add a bit of possibilites on top of just getting internet access. Multiple (tens) of branch offices.
 Solution option 1 is FortiGate on each branch office, and also on HQ. They can then connect them with tunnels and whatnot as use-cases appear. It&#x27;s a desentralized solution which I do like. Nothing needing user-licensing is also just nice. Possibilites are quite grand.
 Solution option 2 is Cisco Secure Access SASE with Meraki gear. It&#x27;s a centralized solution, which means all branch traffic is piped through there. I read there&#x27;s some 250 Mbps limits pr connection, which scares me, and it&#x27;s a lot &quot;younger&quot; solution (but does that mean it&#x27;s still immature?). Licensing is ofc worse, being Cisco. It does however bring a very centralized management as it&#x27;s all centralized.
 Does anybody have good (or bad) experience with this Cisco, Meraki, Umbrella mash-up? Would love to hear your 2 cents. I&#x27;m very familiar with Forti, no experience on Meraki.
 The use-case is first and foremost internet connectivity, then adding on some security (web filter etc), and then possibly adding some centralized service from HQ (interconnecting to a partner or publishing a private app or server for instance).

 Whatcha all use? We would benefit from split tunneling, and also the ability to bring up client VPN before Windows logon.

                              <span>All,
 So we have a quite old machine that runs on our factory floor that has been there for about 30 years. Within the past two months, I have been replacing Cisco 1142APs with 2802Es to great effect. However, this machine, even though it is wired with Cat 5 ethernet is reporting errors between the differing modules. The techs have been replacing the ethernet cables, but still seem to think that the newly placed APs are the cause of this interference/collisions, as these cables tend to be home runs in the ceiling. I currently have the closest 2802E AP set to power level 1 - would turning this down potentially help?

                              <span>Hi,
 We are currently using the Cisco ASR920 -12CZ for our edge routers with BGP, we just peer with default routes and they&#x27;ve been fine, but end of security support.
 According to Cisco the Catalyst 8200 or 8300 is the successor to this product. We just got a quote for the C8300-1N1S-4T2X as this has 10G ports for future upgrades. It&#x27;s wildy more expensive then I imagined, 6k euro a piece with 5k support per device (8x5 nbd on-site).
 The 8200(L) series is much more afordable, but no redundant power and the NM supports a single 10G port which seems awkward. Might just go for the cheapest single-gig model and budget for the 10G model when we get there.
 Are there decently priced alternatives without going into UBNT Edgerouter territory with full support?

                              <span>I read this post, and I think the same about what most of the commentators said... You have to get your hands dirty to really get/improve your skills.. And i believe this cz I&#x27;ve been there and only studying and getting certificates doesn&#x27;t do that well and doesn&#x27;t introduce you to real world problems. And for me, I&#x27;m going to retake the networking courses to get some information back, but this time I&#x27;m looking for some sort of virtual environment or a website where I can solve problems related to networking( same like cybersecurity websites where they challenge to sort off to hack and find vulnerablities), because where I live there isn&#x27;t many internship opportunities for students to get hands onn experience... do you guys have any suggestions or advice? Or do you know any good websites that provides this service?

                              <span>I work as a systems and networks admin at a university. Over the last couple of years cyber has become hot topic, and recently it&#x27;s become pretty much most of our job. But not just issues or tickets relating to cyber security - it&#x27;s full on projects to improve our posture in alignment with several initiatives - it&#x27;s a lot of work.
 A lot of the operational work has been neglected because we&#x27;re cyber security is all that upper management seems to know or care about.
 How does this work at other orgs? Do you have dedicated cyber security staff/a staff member?

                              <span>I don&#x27;t often run into this problem as most of the time I have a cart or kvm 1u but is there something out there that is a thin light durable like 6-8&quot; screen with a keyboard mouse setup that I can just jam in my backpack... Obviously it needs to support VGA but I imagine I can probably get a adapter to HDMI or something and then one of the wireless keyboard and touchpads out there... But I can&#x27;t be the only one wanting something like this and was hoping for a good solution.

Stress level, salary, work life balance are a few things I’m trying to compare. So for those with experience in tech and have been in the business for some time now, do you love your job or would you do something else in the field if you could? If so why?

                              <span>I&#x27;m network consultant and was just working on a deal where a client was spending over $300k on server hardware. I quoted them out some nexus switches for like 30-40k and they were so offended by the price. Asked if they could just run cheap Ubiquiti switches instead. And they are planning on running ISCSI through these switches....
 Like for some reason systems engineers just don&#x27;t understand how important switches are. I&#x27;ve seen people running low budget switches in data centers and it blows my mind how puzzled they are about the performance issues of their server stack. Like these switches have Like 1MB buffers... good luck dealing with burst flows ..
 Anyways people don&#x27;t neglect your switches !

                              <span>I am looking for a smart way to consistently track configuration changes on Linux systems. UseCases where I would find this incredibly helpful are when there are multiple admins in need to change configurations on a regular basis. This e.g. results in issues when a file was changed to a typo without copying it to a backup location first.
 I’ve thought about using Git but couldn’t really sympathize with the idea because of its complexity.
 How are you tackling the challenge? I figured for 90% of the use cases it would probably be sufficient to only track changes to certain files like .conf,.yml,.rules etc. Maybe there’s even a solution combining this into a linter for YAML, XML etc?

                              <span>So long story short. I work at an msp and I worry our only really intelligent engineer/sysadmin may be leaving within a year, as I&#x27;m noticing a change in attitude and he really doesn&#x27;t even need the job.
 The problem is we won&#x27;t really have someone to take over that position and my company won&#x27;t likely hire someone with the same experience due to cost.. 
 I love to learn but getting certs is not really applicable for me as I can&#x27;t really retain knowledge without LOTS of practice,BUT studying them still helps.
 My company treats us VERY well and I want to be able to help if this happends. 
 When anything really serious goes down (clients drive gets deleted by an idiot(me and another tech when I was new 2 years ago) tech he worked all weekend to restore the whole server (veeam). Things like that we don&#x27;t really have a good replacement for tech wise. 
 Where would be a good place to start, to start learning things like this so I could at least be able to help troubleshoot ideas to fix possible large issues? As long as I have basic understanding I can google and get it figured out, but as it stands I don&#x27;t even have that. 
 Unfortunately this person beyond doesn&#x27;t have time to train anyone and doesn&#x27;t do well with dealing with less knowledgeable people as they don&#x27;t have the nessisary social skills/patients for that, so asking them isn&#x27;t really an option. 
 Any help will be much appreciated.

Do you guys have some sort of User Self Service Portal where the user can change those informations, A Connection to HR, get the info via Ticket or via a different route?
 Thanks in advance for your insight.

                              <span>As title says.
 I have begun working in an IT environment using SCCM and it&#x27;S super slow. Before I used clonezilla and ansible to clone machines (Basic sysprep image with a few apps then push the others apps as needed).
 With SSDs it was straightforward and fast. A big 100 GB image would take about 20 min to clone, 5 to 10 for sysprep to do it&#x27;s thing and about 30 min to push the other software we needed (The image had dev environment installed with 40+ programs).
 Out setup was one server directly on the same switch/VLAN to bypass cisco godawful security. We could make our deployment even faster with 10GB Ethernet PCiCards and switch (deployment would then reach 10 min).
 Fast forward to now and I use SCCM in my new job and that thing is a slower than an morbidly obese man doing a maratho…</span>

                              <span>I am a junior sysadmin. In the past I have repackaged some software using the WixToolset.
 A couple of months ago, the maker of ghostscript decided to remove their silent install switch which fucked up our SCCM packages. We can&#x27;t get rid of ghostscript as it is integrated in a lot of our homemade software and management don&#x27;t wanna pay for a corporate license.
 From what I can see, ghostscript is just a drop of files. It works flawlessly just compiling the source code and launching it from any location as long as the files and in the good directory.
 So I figured I could use the Wix Toolset to do just that but when I use the heat component which register my components together it just run for days without completing. 
 I am lost. I am NOT a programmer and programming is not my strenght...at all. I can script but thats it. Main sysadmin is pretty desperate to ask me and I might need some help. My approach is probably wrong. I tried but uncompress files (opening the exe with 7zip) and the binaries created from the source code but both do the same thing.
 There is about 600 files and directory combined for Wix to process. It&#x27;s way more than what I am used to. Maybe thats the problem?
 For now, I used a repackager like Emco and it...kinda works but it&#x27;s clunky and I don&#x27;t trust it at all. I had a lot of issues in the past with it but when it works, it works. 
 I borrowed a licence from an a friend but its a one time deal.
 Anyone have an idea how to do this cleanly?

                              <span>I hope this is allowed here and the right platform
 -i want to create a linux .sh script that checks inside a given folder if there is a folder inside was created today
 -if the folder is present then copy it together with its contents to a given destination
 ​
 My use case:
 I&#x27;m manually copying backup folders with databases to a storage every morning after the backups run around 4 am, so i want to automate it with a script
 ​
 The code: (NB: the paths are trials on a virtual linux machine before i use the code on real paths and real server)
 #!/bin/bash
 ​
 # Set the source and destination directories
 source_dir&#x3D;&quot;/home/graffius/Desktop/Hana/Sei/NT_DB&quot;&quot;dest_dir&#x3D;&quot;/home/graffius/Desktop/Rvnas2/schemas/NT_DB&quot;
 ​
 # Get the current date
 today&#x3D;$(date +&quot;%Y-%m-%d&quot;)
 ​
 # Search for subdirectories created today in the source directory
 new_dirs&#x3D;$(find &quot;$source_dir&quot; -type d -newerct &quot;$today 00:00:00&quot; ! -newerct &quot;$today 23:59:59&quot;)
 ​
 # Copy the new directories to the destination directory
 for dir in $new_dirs; do
 cp -R &quot;$dir&quot; &quot;$dest_dir&quot;
 done
 ​
 The error message in Terminal
 graffius@graffiuslinux:~$ ./try.sh
 ./try.sh: line 14: unexpected EOF while looking for matching \&quot;&#x27;&#x60;
 ./try.sh: line 16: syntax error: unexpected end of file

                              <span>Hey, I&#x27;m new to SQL Server setups and testing a SQL Express setup in a lab and trying to work out the best practise for installing it. My query is around storage locations, I&#x27;m guessing its best to have the Databases on a separate D drive. However at which stage should this be setup? Reading online theres mixed views if to chnage during install or install all to C then chnage data, temp, logs, etc to D after install?
 Which is the best way to do it in your opinions?
 TIA

                              <span>Hello fellow sysadmins,
 I’m currently managing a large number of cloud and on-premisses servers and am looking for an efficient and secure way to streamline my workflow. I’m particularly interested in a web-accessible system where I can visualize server states (resources, alerts, services, containers, etc.), access them via the web interface using SSH, and add new servers either directly or by installing an agent on the server.
 Moreover, considering security is paramount in our field, I’d highly value any tools that offer two-factor authentication (2FA).
 I’ve explored solutions like Cockpit Project, Webmin/Virtualmin, Rancher,.. but none have all features. While these tools offer several of the features I mentioned, I’d love to hear what you all are using and if there’s something out there that might better align with my needs.
 Could you kindly share your recommendations, experiences, or even potential custom solutions you might have developed? I appreciate any guidance.
 Thanks in advance!

 The situation as it stands I have two file servers. One for operations and one for C-level people. Each server has a drive on it for &quot;IT documentation&quot; since we have some IT that only services operations and some that only service C-Level. But there is a small group that has access to both so there is a security group that gives access to both drives. I am a member of this group and we are promoting a person so I added them to the security group (same group membership as I have). When they login on their PC they have access to the C-Level IT drive, but not the Ops IT drive. When trying to access it they receive the notice that they do…</span>

 Regarding DNS, I guess that is set well. The domain A record is set to the IP in Cloudflare. Also, when I change that A record to another server that I have, it works.I would love to know how to approach the problem if I don&#x27;t even see logs.

                              <span>Hi, I was told by a senior network engineer it is not an issue, but I am not convinced and hope to get a second opinion. The issue is we have intermittent very slow connection between a client and a server. It traverses a Palo Alto and a Checkpoint firewall. My layman eyes naturally focussed on the frequent 2-3 RSTs sent in quick succession. What&#x27;s more, 2 of the RSTs have the same sequence number, and that sequence number was also seen in a FIN/ACK packet just sent, as well as Acked&#x27; in another FIN ACK... ie
 ​
 443 -&gt; 696969 [FIN, ACK] Seq&#x3D;5202 Ack&#x3D;6666
 696969 -&gt; 443 [FIN, ACK] Seq&#x3D;6666 Ack&#x3D;5171
 443 -&gt; 696969 [ACK] Seq&#x3D;5203 Ack&#x3D;6667
 696969 -&gt; 443 [RST] Seq&#x3D;6666
 696969 -&gt; 443 [RST] Seq&#x3D;6667
 696969 -&gt; 443 [RST] Seq&#x3D;6666
 ​
 Do you think I am on to something, as in this is clear indication the firewall is messing and/or dropping packets? Even then, I dont understand why the sequence number is reused for both FIN and RST. Any insight is greatly appreciated.
 ​
 EDIT: Forgot to mention, there&#x27;s load balancers as well.

                              <span>Hello,
 I have kind of a strange issue:
 I have setup a few site to site IKEv2 IPSec tunnels with a few Cisco router. 
 Settings: SHA512/AES256/DH-group20 for both P1 and P2.
 The tunnel establishes just fine, and everything works as expected (HTTPS/ICMP/TCP etc). Until the timeout is reached and its prepared for a rekey.
 Now with it being an IKEv2 tunnel PFS is only enabled upon the first re-key of the tunnel. Once this rekey happens, TCP traffic seems to stop working. Ping/Traceroute all seem to work fine. 
 I don&#x27;t understand why PFS is adding that much overhead to the Packet. As if I set the DF bit to clear, the packets are fragmented and TCP connections work fine again. So this is leading me to some kind of MTU/MSS issue.
 I tested a ping from R1--&gt;R2 (without fragmentation) and the most I can get through before PFS is enabled is 1280 bytes, after PFS is enabled the max I can go is 1150 (alot of overhead being added to the pack which is strange). Which is an extremely small size (in my opinion) to set the max TCP-mss to.
 Now im waiting for someone to give me a PCAP of the trouble router to find the optimal MSS/MTU size, hopefully the issue will be more present there. 
 I have a few sites working just fine with just ISAKMP/GRE/IPSEC setup. 
 Sorry I have been troubleshooting this for some time now. Just looking for any advice you can give. Or if anyone has had any similar experiences with IKEv2 and PFS (in p2)? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>I am studying for a networking certification and am curious about the two standardization systems used for ethernet.
 On the one hand I have studied the speeds and max distances of Cat5/Cat5e/Cat6... but then I have also had to to do the same for 10BASE-T/100BASE-T/100BASE-FX.
 What is the difference between these two standardizations and what are they called? In terms of the SAT, &quot;Cat5 is to ____ as 10BASE-T is to ___&quot;?

                              <span>Gentlemen,
 Not sure if this is the right place post this. As the title states, I have a interview soon with a fantastic company. I really want this job and I don&#x27;t want to shit the bed. I am looking for some advice as far as prep work is concerned. I consider myself well spoken and think of my ability to interview not be an issue. I am worried about the technical aspect. Any help on what to brush up on or look out for would be greatly appreciated. Obviously I am aware that this is a very broad question and the interviewer can ask anything.
 Background: Years of IT support with some network admin experience thrown in. I currently have my CCNA, A+, Security + although it has been over a year since the exam.
 To give a little bit about the job posting without revealing too much. They are asking for on preferred qualifications, (experience in that niche field) which I have. CCNA which I have.
 Here is some of the technical listed.
 experience managing data networks with Cisco routers and switches
 experience configuring Cisco network equipment
 Palo Alto firewalls, F5 load balancing, Cisco 9000 series, and Cisco Nexus Platform
 I have been studying all week and brushing up on my CCNA material. But I wanted to come to my fellow reddit goers for any shared network engineer interview experiences that may guide me.
 If I am in the wrong place, Please let me know and I will promptly remove.
 God speed gentlemen.
 ​
 ​
 Edit: ** Wow! I was not expecting all the comments and support. 
 Thanks a lot guys! 
 This certainly has helped me feel better about the interview and the process moving forward. I will take all these ideas into consideration and apply them. 
 Much appreciated!

                              <span>I’ll skip the long back story, but I’m thinking about putting 4 access points on a unmanaged / dumb Poe switch. The access points tag vlan traffic based on ssid.
 What happens to the tagged frame when it enters and leaves an unmanaged switch? 
 The unmanaged switch would then connect to a managed switch before it goes to the router. 
 From an operational standpoint, would this work or does your unmanaged switch trash vlan tags ?

 So i understand that ASA is speaking STP, how it is possible?

 I was updating the IP config to some PLCs (Logix 1769) when I accidentally set one of the PLCs to 0.0.0.X/24
 The only way except pulling it apart to go the serial route is to force a new IP through RsLogix
 Curiously we do have access to an Allen Bradley display where it would read modbus data if set to read from 0.0.0.X
 BootP is unfortunately disabled
 Question: is it possible to force a NIC in windows to 0.0.0.X/24 in any way, ignoring the reserved subnets?

                              <span>Hey fellow network admins!
 I&#x27;m currently trying to figure out the best way to configure the following setup, and I could really use your expertise. I&#x27;m in charge of administering two Cisco routers, each equipped with 2 WAN ports and 4 LAN ports. One of the routers serves as the main router in an MPLS network, connected to the corporate network. The backup router connects the corporate network via DMVPN.
 Currently, the LAN is directly connected to both WAN routers, ensuring redundancy through HSRP and IP SLAs. However, we now want to introduce a firewall cluster between the LAN and the WAN, so that the LAN side is protected by the firewalls and the default gateways for the LAN networks reside on the firewall. To achieve this, we plan to establish a transit network between the Cisco routers and the firewall cluster.
 The customer&#x27;s network are isolated from other customers using VRFs. We are currently utilizing MPBGP with iBGP for the LAN customer networks and OSPF for overlay purposes.
 Here&#x27;s what we have implemented in the past so far: redundancy through OSPF with corresponding costs and a distribute list to only learn specific networks.
 I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or insights on how to achieve redundancy for the firewall cluster in the most straightforward manner. Are there any other methods or best practices you could recommend?
 Thanks in advance for your help!

                              <span>Hi guys, I got one question that maybe someone can answer here. 
 I was upgradeing 2960x switch that was master in a stack. It had two members, and one of the member upgraded successfully but the other one did not. Now when I type in “show switch” it says that one member is in stack but the other is not because of mismatch version. 
 I want to know what can I do to upgrade that switch that has mismatch version? Also, I want to know how can I found out IP address of that switch since the “show switch” only displays MAC address? Can I upgrade that switch just by connecting to it or is it possible to upgrade it only through the master in a stack?
 I dont have much experience in networking so this question may seem like a joke to someone, but I could really use some help.

                              <span>Pardon the long post. Asking for recommendations. We’re currently setting up a wireless CCTV network for our small poultry farm that is off-grid. Has around 18 or so buildings for minimizing staff theft and slacking off. It’s a management nightmare, really.
 We would be using starlink as a main line of internet. Now, would it be adviceable to use AP or P2P to extend the wifi range to reach the wireless CCTVs? Each building cluster is like 30-50m apart from the main building where Starlink will be installed. The main building should also have a big screen to see all cctv feed. And should also have night vision. And accessible thru the internet casually
 Hope this gets some attention thank you

                              <span>Hi all, I’m fairly new to fiber connections and I’m trying to figure out the right polarity when it comes to chaining multiple fiber connections. Basically I am connecting one switch to multiple patch panels and then to another switch. 
 Both switches will have LC to SC connections (LC at the switch). So basically it goes like this:
 LC (Switch) -&gt; SC (Patch Panel) -&gt; SC (Patch Panel) -&gt; SC (Patch Panel) -&gt; SC (Patch Panel) -&gt; LC (Switch)
 I know its typically A to B connections for transferring and receiving but does it stay the same for the patch panel portion? Or does it repeatedly rotate? So would it be:
 A is left for LC -&gt; A(top of SC) -&gt; Same as previous SC -&gt; Same as previous SC -&gt; Same as previous SC -&gt; B is left of LC.
 OR
 A is left for LC -&gt; B(top of SC) -&gt; A is top of SC -&gt; B is top of SC -&gt; A is top of SC -&gt; B is left for LC

                              <span>Sorry if this is against post guidelines but there isn’t really a good Visio related sub on Reddit so this might be my next best option.
 I’m working on an “interactive” office layout that will show employee information based on the office selected by the user. I also had a thought to have a visual representation of departments by area. I’m able to get the individual offices to work as intended but once I create a bigger shape that will encompass all the smaller offices to represent the entire area of the department and then link that “department” shape to data I’m no longer able to select any of the office shapes nested within it.
 I can provide an image that might explain better if needed but essentially think of it as having a network switch diagram. You have each individual port linked to a dataset. However, when you then create the shape for the entire switch and link that to something you can no longer select the port links when published.

 Some but not all of the clients are making 1 DHCP request every second. Also most of these same clients are roaming to far less optimal APs than they should (5GHz only and load balancing disabled) every 15 to 20 seconds. I’m mainly focusing on the DHCP issue at the moment because the roaming issue comes and goes by the DHCP issue is in every trace. The server that responds is the correct server. Is this possibly a setting on the clients? Has anybody seen anything like this?

 Please I need advise on the below 
 Experiencing a strange issue in my network environment. I have an x2 9500-16x switch in a VSS running as the core switch- Version 16.9.5. So the IP gateways of services are configured on SVIs on this switch. Lately, I started noticing heavy packet loss on pings destined for the SVIs on the switch. Below are my observation so far;
 Packet loss to the switch when running a ping test SSH traffic to the switch is very slow There are no CRC errors on the uplink. Traffic flowing through the switch has no issues. No packet loss to switches connecting to this core switch. No issue with data plane traffic yet. Now, i have looked at the system cpp policy and even increased the cpp-police-data rate to 800pps but didn&#x27;t help. Am i looking at the right thing here has anyone experienced this issue and how did you manage to resolve it. Please advise

Only the pay-per-minute sim I had, would work and that didn&#x27;t work for me.
 I was told by a few people that Cisco doesn&#x27;t actually load balance.
  
Active-active dual router SD-WAN topology
  
https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/routers/sd-wan-vendor-comparison.html#~chart
 Cisco appears to claim it can handle it better than the other guy so I don&#x27;t know. Typically I have found Cisco to be more configurable than most other units. Popular opinion is that I am dead wrong on this one.
 So, Pepwave is out. Cisco might be out. What other quality unit might be able to handle a dual cellular (load balanced) Mexico configuration?
 I can&#x27;t find a product list for silver-peak, to see which units would have dual cellular.

 To provide further context and to start clarifying what my approach is here is the lab design and requirement:
  
two branch DCs: DC1 and DC3
 central hub HUB
 DC1 connects to HUB, HUB connectd to DC3 - to get from DC1 to DC3 you have to go via HUB
 DC1 and DC3 have the DCx_SW (L3 switch), DCx_FW (firewall), DCx_Edge (WAN router)
 DC1 and DC3 have 3 zones LAN, DMZ, PROD
 DC1 LAN is 172.16.1.0/24, DMZ is 10.1.0.0/24, PROD is 192.168.1.0/24
 DC3 LAN is 172.16.3.0/24, DMZ is 10.1.0.0/24, PROD is 192.168.3.0/24 and 192.168.33.0/24
 each zone is a separate VRF on DCx_SW
 each zone network is an interface on the DCx_SW (i.e. port1,2,3)
 Intra-Zone (i.e. DC1_LAN to DC3_LAN or DC3_PROD to DC3_PROD) traffic does not traverse the firewall

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 I am aware that this may be a controversial topic that has been discussed before, but some of the existing threads include arguments probably not of relevance any more (e.g., power consumption of first generation NICs) or do not apply in my specific scenario (e.g., no plans to change to 10Gbit/s switching). So here goes:
 We have a NAS (Synology DS1821+) which is used for central data storage via 1Gbit/s LAN to a multitude of users - there is no intent to change this. However, one of our servers needs access to a lot of data being stored on this server, which is why we thought to upgrade to 10Gbit for this single connection (going up to 25Gbit does not seem warranted since we use SATA drives in the NAS). The distance between server and NAS are just a few meters, so we would not need the benefits fiber provides in this area. Costs should be kept as low as reasonable.
 - Would you suggest copper or fiber in this context? 
 - We initially planned to use Mellanox ConnectX-4 on the server, but even off-brand copper SFP+ modules are way more expensive than I thought - on the contrary, the fiber version of synology&#x27;s NICs are more expensive :D
 - We could also purchase a 10Gbit NIC for the server with RJ45: Do you recommend an Intel version? I have heard that Intel is leaving the networking market (but that may have been just for switches), so I am a little worried about long-term support. There are also versions of Intel NICs from different manufacturers (HP, DELL, etc.)...are these 100% compatible in any server (running Windows Server 2022) or just in servers of that manufacturer?
 Just let me know what you think :).

What do people recommend to filter out the less savoury aspects of internet?? Is a specific dns server or something a good idea so I can only use it on specific devices?

                              <span>Hello r/networking 
 For the past 2 years I&#x27;ve been working as a B2B contractor. I have 7 years overall experience and the certs to go for it (CCNA, CCNP + some Juniper ones too). 
 I&#x27;m curious how the B2B market for network engineers looks in the EU looks for you guys. Because to me, this market looks really weird. 
 On the one hand, there seem to be plenty of new positions open. On the other hand, even though I have the &quot;open to work&quot; tag on LinkedIn, I have one or two recruiters reaching out to me. Back during the Covid days, I got between 3-5 offers per week and I didn&#x27;t even have the &quot;open to work&quot; tag. Even if I apply to positions (EU wide, looking for a digital nomad lifestyle), only 1-in-10 even comeback with an offer and their meaning of hybrid is relocation to their country. 
 What are your thoughts on this ? Bear market ? Is it getting better ? Is this the new normal ?

                              <span>Our IT department is severely understaffed and overworked. Our CIO keeps suggesting hiring vendors/consultants instead of hiring staff. I’m all for vendors to do a project from A to Z and done. I’m against, however, utilizing consultants as an answer to understaffing issues and bandwidth. Our outage windows are late at night so even paying a consultant is 3 to 4 times the amount it costs to pay a full time employee. Often times you have to hand hold the vendor and teach them the environment. Half the time you end up doing a majority of the work or stranded in meetings with these people sucking up hours. I recently suggested getting two Junior Admins one for networking and one for Systems. The CIO didn’t even want to have a dialog, I got upset and said “There’s a reason we keep telling you …</span>

                              <span>The title says it well. I’m 19yo, currently in college at a STEM university for Computer Networking and Sys Admin, and while I am enjoying learning, I am also realizing that I would be headed into a career filled with burnout. I have been working as a Helpdesk Tech at my City Municipality for almost 2 years now. I got into IT by going through my local career center and doing on the job training at the place I am working currently (they hired my on full time over summers while I’m home from college). The work is fun, but I also struggle with my mental health (bipolar 2, and I am receiving treatment now) and it is usually only a week or two that I am feeling well before I become burnt out an enter a breakdown. It doesn’t help that I see how tired my coworkers are, especially our net/sys admi…</span>

                              <span>Have heard a few blogs and posts regurgitating the same statement that Windows 12 (rumored to be released Fall 2024) will require SSDs to upgrade. Every time I hear it, I can&#x27;t find the source of that statement. Has anyone heard otherwise or is the internet just making shit up like usual? Trying to stay as far ahead of the shit storm as possible.

                              <span>As a sysadmin, I&#x27;ve grown to both love and hate bug trackers and &quot;project management&quot; software, but I reckon a lightweight bug tracker, when properly setup, can help one keep track of projects and tasks.
 I like Redmine, I&#x27;ve used it in a few jobs and I feel that it&#x27;s alright for my daily use (small teams in small orgs).
 So I&#x27;m wondering if it would be a good tool to manage my personal projects (either sysadmin related or other stuff). I&#x27;ve always been disorganized for personal stuff, I know it&#x27;s caused partly by executive dysfunction (ADD), I looked up thinks like the GTD method and other methods, they look good but I can&#x27;t seem to apply them.
 Here are two examples of &quot;projects&quot; I&#x27;ve been working on for some time, but not completed :

 As the title says, I need to perform a drill on control system where a simulated attack will be witnessed by one of the users, it will be communicated according the Cyber Incident Response plan and so on, to ensure the procedure works fine and users are aware about how to handle such situations.
 Currently, I am thinking about scheduling a task to bring up an Image on the screen that would look like a Ransomware Attack or something similar.
 Can anyone please give some advice and tips on doing the same in a better way?
 Thank you for your time.

 Thank you to everyone who shared their wisdom and reassured me that using GPOs to manage workstations is acceptable. Currently, we do have some GPOs in place, such as password complexity and security policies. The disagreement lies in whether the domain GPO should govern workstation settings. I manually configure certain settings on the images, like disabling unnecessary programs and features, to minimize user errors. Some machines require specific configurations, such as setting Edge&#x27;s homepage to our intranet. Ideally, I would like to rely on the domain to automate these configurations.

 How many do you have? Has anyone gone beyond 3?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve only been managing the network in our organization for a few years now, but a phrase I&#x27;m very quickly getting tired of is &quot;it&#x27;s the network/Wi-Fi.&quot; Whenever I hear a vendor, colleague, or end user utter this, the odds are about 8/10 that it&#x27;s never the case. I can appreciate how end users or even technicians without a good bit of knowledge in this area might reach that conclusion, but what baffles me is when knowledgable IT people come to this conclusion with absolutely no evidence or reason.
 A case in point would be a vendor I recently dealt with, they&#x27;re very knowledgable in their area and probably have more years IT experience than I&#x27;ve been alive, but then it pivoted to that dreaded phrase. Through the course of troubleshooting, it became clear they had no idea how DHCP worked. Again, I understand how people can have specialized areas of knowledge, but how the fuck can you spend 3 decades supporting networked devices and have no idea how they receive IP addresses!?
 Even beyond that, so many trash apps immediately throw errors like &quot;There&#x27;s a problem with your Wi-Fi&quot; when in reality, they are experiencing an outage. Sure, that might sound better to the end user, but it&#x27;s completely wrong and sending them in the direction of troubleshooting something that&#x27;s working perfectly fine. Are the devs really that lazy and incompetent that they can&#x27;t try to ping some common external resources to determine that the network is functional? Or shit, at the very least add the word &quot;might&quot; in front of that rather than convey with absolute certainty that your shit app expertly diagnosed that your Wi-Fi is indeed broken.

                              <span>Working for a small/medium sized business that is growing. And with each bit of growth the needs of the business expand. Often into areas that involve technology. But really, doesn&#x27;t almost EVERYTHING involve technology now?
 So we&#x27;ve been having a lot of conversations about how and who should take on some of this stuff. I&#x27;m doing what I consider traditional IT stuff for them. Business wide systems. Laptops, servers, 365 and similar cloud services, basic support, etc. and I find myself saying this a lot... That isn&#x27;t &quot;IT.&quot; Things like data analysis, or application development, or trainings, or web design.
 And it occurred to me this really depends on how you define IT. I&#x27;ve worked at places where IT is one giant department that handles everything even tangentially related to technology. They are usually bureaucratic behemoths that everyone hates to deal with, but to each their own. And I&#x27;ve worked at places that decentralize this more. The communications department might handle websites, the analytics staff would handle data work, app development department builds apps, and an internal IT department does what I basically do.
 Curious how ya&#x27;ll personally think about this and what your experience at different jobs has been. Is your IT department the kitchen sink department? Or are there specialized departments that handle different things, and if so, what is the department called that consists of admins and business wide support?

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m having an issue with a shortcut I deploy via group policy. Its a shortcut to an exe on a mapped network drive. When the shortcut is executed, the program starts and a login window comes up. Problem is: the login window should be filled out (server address, user, password, database) but is empty. When I double click the exe its working as intended. When I create the shortcut manually (right click on exe &gt; Send to &gt; Desktop (create shortcut)), its working too.
 The software engineer told me the login window stays empty when it has no access to the ini file, which is located in the same folder as the exe. I could verify that, when I rename the ini file and execute the exe, the login window is empty.
 Anyone has an idea why and how to fix this?
 The program was made by a local software engineer, it doesnt need to be installed, but the exe needs Gupta Team Developer installed on the client, its a framework like .NET (I was told).
 Thanks!
 ​

 Looking at Ventoy&#x27;s ability to boot virtual disk images and ISO&#x27;s is very appealing.

                              <span>Following up on my earlier post now that the Evocative EWR1 fire is out. How do other data centers deal with such events? Electrical fires are common so I assume not every data center shuts down for days every time there is one. Sounds like they had the redundancy, but the Fire Marshall turned off the power to the entire Colo.

                              <span>Hi,
 I have externally hosted cloud application wanting to send external SMTP on my organizations behalf.
 As summary , We use an external company, who have built and also host a web portal for us, with the web portal being hosted on a Linux server. The web portal used to connect to our Exchange Onprem, through a user account we setup, to send out emails to everyone (Internal or External ) from e.g. portal@company.com email address.
 AFAIK , I will use HAT Policy (allowing sender public IP address). I don&#x27;t have any experience. How can I do that ?
 Also , I want to use SMTP Authentication. I will create new mailbox user on Exchange Server. My external app will this mailbox for relay.
 My environment : 
 Mx Records :
 smtp.company.com
 smtp2.company.com
 Cisco IronPort (Incoming and outgoing mail flow)
 Exchange Server 2013

                              <span>Hello, this may not be the best sub for this, but I am looking for a remote desktop program for a friend to use over the following couple of weeks. He has a main desktop that he works off of, and a laptop, but all his files are on the desktop. While hes away, he needs a way to access everything on the desktop so he can continue working as he normally does. He mainly works with Word and Excel.
 I&#x27;m pretty alright with tech, so I&#x27;m not worried about figuring out how to utilize whatever you all recommend, but the last time I used a remote desktop software was about 10 years ago with teamviewer, and have no clue what people are using these days. I also don&#x27;t know if that would work if no one is able to use the source computer, which is the case here. He needs full access to his main pc without anyone else&#x27;s help.
 I also considered just literally downloading his entire harddrive onto a portable drive, and plugging into his laptop so he has all his files, but I&#x27;m not sure how big it is, or if this is even the best solution, so I come here asking you all. 
 Please lmk if you have any more questions and any recommendations as to what we should do. Thanks

                              <span>What is the recommended method for managing AV config for servers? A requirement to manage servers via MDE is to Hybrid Join the servers. As it&#x27;s not possible to Hybrid Join DCs I assume we have to use GPO to configure Defender AV settings for DCs.
 Seems a bit annoying to use MDE to manage all other servers and GPO for DCs only. Would rather have a single platform to manage settings accross the board, so leaning towards GPO only.
 Thoughts?

 Is it anything better out there?

                              <span>For reasons, in the org I&#x27;m at right now, there are approximately 7 domains with 6 being used regularly. Some domains have one way some have two way transitive one has forest relationships. Others have no direct as trust relationships but use a 3rd party tool to effect the trust. 
 It&#x27;s a 12000 seat org and the domains can loosely described as corp-dev-uat &amp; special-dev-uat
 The members of the &#x27;special&#x27; domain include potentially nefarious individuals. Can&#x27;t elaborate further on that.
 Somehow in a fever dream I imagined it as a resource domain cascading out with appropriate trust relationships so the the nefarious individuals couldn&#x27;t swim upstream permission or authentication wise. 
 I know it&#x27;s possible, but it&#x27;s likely a massive undertaking to do without tying something in knots and breaking it permission wise 
 Off the top of your conical heads what would I find lurking in Pandora&#x27;s box should this go fwd?
 General issues, I know that you can&#x27;t speak specifically to this scenarios details

                              <span>I mainly use the Busines Premium licenses since it includes Intune and Azure AD P1 and some other bits. However I have a client who&#x27;s just wanting Business Standard to start and I am trying to work out what&#x27;s missing so can note it down for them before going ahead.
 I&#x27;ve setup a Bus Standard license on a dummy tenant and it appears that the Defender for 365 is enabled since I can set Anti Spam and Anti Phising policies and safe links etc setup. I thought this wasn&#x27;t able to be done in business standard as required Defender for 365 P1 license?
 Can anyone explain? Do they let you setup but not work?

                              <span>Hello everyone, I am trying to setup chef workstation on my new company Mac laptop according to https://docs.chef.io/workstation/getting\_started/. Under the &quot;Configure Ruby Environment&quot; header near the top, I followed the instructions, but when I do the last step of &quot;which ruby&quot;, it gives me /usr/bin/ruby, instead of the correct path /opt/chef-workstation/embedded/bin/ruby.I also exited the shell session and opened a new one, but it is still showind /usr/bin/ruby (edited)
 This guide walks you through the four parts to set up Chef Workstation on your computer.
 Configure Ruby Environment Set up your chef-repo for storing your cookbooks Set up Chef Credentials Verify Client-to-Server Communication Prerequisites Download and install Chef Workstation A running instance of Chef Infra Server or Hosted Chef Server.
 Also not sure if this is relevant, but when it says to
 echo &#x27;eval &quot;$(chef shell-init bash)&quot;&#x27; &gt;&gt; ~/.bashrc
 I did that, but I noticed my .bashrc is only has eval &quot;$(chef shell-init bash)&quot;. Does that mean I did not have a .bashrc file before that command, or at the very least it was an empty file?

                              <span>Hello everyone, I am just getting a decent understanding of Microsoft Kiosk Mode with Edge, and I have a questions. I have it set to point to a certain URL, but that URL needs an account signed into it to access it, I&#x27;ve noticed that rebooting will cause it to sign out of that account. Is there a way to have it maintain the account that is logged in even through reboots? Or is it possible to write a PowerShell script that will perform the few clicks, and entering the username/password and signing in. Again I am extremely new to Microsoft kiosk and the support page is awful.

 What is the worst experience you&#x27;ve had using/administering server core? Would you recommend it to your friends or family?

                              <span>So I&#x27;m a sysadmin/network engineer and I recently made a game studio startup and we&#x27;re big enough now that I feel like it&#x27;s actually smart to do proper auth and where better to get info for that than here?
 What I&#x27;m thinking I want for the flow is this:
 1. Make Google Workspace email
 2. Assign it a permission level
 3. Have it able to SSO to everything in the toolset via Keycloak and Caddy depending on permission level without needing to invite manually
 This should all be accessible via private VPN and for that I&#x27;m eyeballing Netmaker because wireguard go brrrr. 
 As far as I can tell I can use a mix of Workspace, LDAP, Keycloak, and Caddy to achieve a setup like this that allows provisioning permissions easily and SSO and that&#x27;s what I&#x27;m sitting on right now. 
 Anyone got advice? Better practice or setup? Free knowledge?
 My first time having to do this and I&#x27;m learning on the fly, give it to be straight if I&#x27;m doing stupid shit.
 Thanks. :D

                              <span>Today my &quot;Security Admin&quot; got a notification that one of our users laptops was infected with a virus. Proceeded to lock the user out of all systems (didn&#x27;t disable the laptop just the user). 
 Eventually the user brings the laptop into the office to get scanned. The SA then goes to our Senior Network Admin and asks what to do with the laptop. Not knowing that there&#x27;s an antivirus or what antivirus even is. After being informed to log into the computer and start the virus scan he brings the laptop closed back to the SNA again and says &quot;The scan is going to take 6.5 hours it&#x27;s 1pm, but we leave at 5&quot;.
 SNA replies &quot;ok then just check it in the morning&quot; 
 SA &quot;So leave the computer unlocked overnight?!?!?&quot; 
 SNA explains that it&#x27;ll keep running while it&#x27;s locked.
 Laptop starts to ring from a teams/zoom call and the SA looks absolutely baffled that the laptop is making noise when it&#x27;s &quot;off&quot;
 SNA then has to explain that just because a lid is closed doesn&#x27;t mean the computer is turned all the way off. 
 The SA has a BA in Cyber Security and doesn&#x27;t know his ass from his head. How someone like this has managed to continue his position is baffling at this point.
 This is really only the tip of the iceberg as he stated he doesn&#x27;t know what a zip file even does or why we block them just that &quot;they&#x27;re bad&quot;
 We&#x27;ve attempted to train him, but absolutely nothing has stuck with him. Our manager refuses to get rid of him for the sheer fact that he doesn&#x27;t want a vacancy in the role.

                              <span>Simple request comes in a day ago: 
 Please add Department H Distro list to the Survey List for Region S.
 Done. Informed both parties, both are happy. Ticket closed.
 Ticket gets reopened with a new note: Hi Randall, it does not look like my (head of that dept Department H got a Survey that happened this morning. I have attached the survey email that should have been received. Please fix this ASAP as we can not miss these emails in our work flow and are needed for the weekly reports to the C Suite.
 Sounding kinda serious. Let me stop my youtube watching for a few minutes and look into. Message trace shows a consistent stream of surveys going to both sets of lists and being expanded out. All the titles are the same (Limit of the survey system supposedly, not my department to address). Well that sucks for looking for the email. Pull the message ID from the attached email. Update the search for just the message ID. There we go, much better details... and it shows as delivered to Dept H list and shows that the Dept Head also received the email. Grab the time stamp, ask the end user to confirm if they do or do not have the email from said time in their Outlook. 
 Head of Dept H: NO. You need to FIX THIS NOW!
 Me: Alright, maybe it got accidentally deleted, let me do a discovery search for this email. (The email is right in the inbox as it should be) Alright, I am showing it in your inbox at the time it should have been.
 Head of Dept: You are lying to me. I am going to the VP of IT
 Me: Feel free, but it is there (messaged VP and gave the heads up)
 10 minutes later...
 Head of Dept: ... I found it in my inbox at the time you said while on the phone with your VP. Please close this request.
 VP of IT: Yeah, that was a FAFO moment for them.
 Reminder, your IT department will have the receipts

 I wanted to check in with more sysadmins online to determine if Turnkey has a good reputation in 2023 and if anyone is using their images.
 Any opinions, guidance or recommendations are welcome.

                              <span>So our organizations clocks have been off on every workstation by 2 minutes. It wasn’t affecting any systems so I mostly just left it alone since I couldn’t find the answer easily at the time. 
 Then I got a request from the CEO to get the clocks synced, so I made it a priority. Finding the solution took some work but I fixed it and I feel proud of it. My boss is happy, my coworkers were happy, I’m happy. 
 I know it’s something you guys deal with all the time and the fix was super simple in the end…but sometimes it’s the little things that are worth celebrating.
 Just thought I’d share.

                              <span>I don&#x27;t understand these IT Sales people....if we say we are not interested multiple times they would continue emailing non-stop it&#x27;s not even funny anymore. What they don&#x27;t realize is that they are trying to piss off the same person who could literally block every single email coming from their domain. I actually had done this on a couple companies already. There was one I mildly entertained because I was interested on what they are offering but then I found a better one...told them I am no longer interested in the most kindest possible way. Few days later started sending multiple emails to my CxOs asking us to reconsider them and that they are emailing me and I&#x27;m not replying back? Like...really? Good thing my CxOs informed me right away so I took care of it the best way possible - blocked that Company&#x27;s domain completely without remorse. 
 What do you guys think? Did you have any similar experience?

                              <span>Hey! 
 I work in the hospital IT and our staff is using iPads. They carry the iPads with them at all times because they are traveling between patients. 
 I have an issue of people forgetting the passcode of the iPad or locking themselves out, even they are the ones who set it up initially. 
 Very often MDM can’t clear the passcode because the iPad requires Internet connection and they can’t connect to the internet because it’s locked which leads me to have iPad replaced. 
 I tried to configure the iPad as “Shared”, but it doesn’t work for us since Apple requires a shared iPad passcode after authentication via Azure AD lol. 
 The only solution I’m thinking of right now is to set up a passcode for the iPad which is the last 4 or 6 digits for the SN. What you guys think? Any other solutions?

The contents describe a user reporting that they dialed our main number and were redirected to a phishing attempt. I called our main number from my cell to verify, and was greeted by our receptionist, just as normal. A quick chat confirmed that nobody reported any problems and it&#x27;s been a normal day so far.
 Check with the reporting user, who had mentioned one of their customers seeing the problem. I get the contact info for the customer, talk to them and after two minutes ascertain that they had dialed the wrong number and apologized for the mix up. No problem, I assure them.

 What do you Reddit wizards think is going to become of Active Directory in the coming years? For many organizations, moving fully cloud is a massive overhaul so I do not think that is viable at this time. Thoughts?

I am a student who wanted to be a system administrator, I want to learn things to becoming system administrator, i know some stuff about computer system servicing but haven&#x27;t practiced or used it actually. I want to learn and be certified system administrator, i am willing to learn again and put in the work. The thing is I don&#x27;t know where to start or what to learn, i am wandering everywhere in order to learn how to become sys admin. Anything that you guys will suggest me to do or a roadmap also where to access modules and lessons would be a great help for me, thanks!

                              <span>So we had a domain admin account get locked out today. We did our research and found out the cause. We informed the owner of the account why it happened. The owner said OK I&#x27;ll unlock it. We figured he would just get another team member to unlock the account. Our tool showed a few minutes later that the locked out account unlocked the same locked out account. I asked him how did you unlock the account. He said I already had my ADUC already open with my domain admin account. WTF? Locked out account can unlock accounts? Is there something I&#x27;m missing here? Delay? It was a good hour before we told him the cause and before the account was approved to be unlocked. Also, please no &quot;should not be using domain admins blah blah.&quot; We&#x27;re a work in progress right now :)

 A question for anyone who may know:
 A client installs PDF software through Dell Digital Delivery. One of their users has a Surface and wants the software installed.
 Can you install software through DDD on a Microsoft Surface?

                              <span>Way back in 1995, our company hired PwC to set up its first internal domain (NT servers &amp; Win98!), who gave it a friendly domain name but no one thought to purchase/register the name for ourselves. It&#x27;s a 3-letter domain name, and by the time I took over IT in 2005, it was of course taken and they wanted some exorbitant amount of money for it so we didn&#x27;t purchase it. Because it was so entrenched and I didn&#x27;t have the expertise to rename our domain nor the money to get help to do that, we&#x27;ve kept it in place so all our devices are in that &quot;abc.com&quot; domain. I&#x27;ve had to do DNS direct entries and manage firewall and routing rules to prevent domain devices from trying to resolve this at Linode-hosted servers where the current domain owner has it pointed to.

 I&#x27;ve been in or adjacent to the IT/Sysadmin role for almost 20 years (I&#x27;m 39 btw) and since covid WFH started on March 16th, 2020, I&#x27;ve been working towards/wanting to leave the industry.
 Why? ... Corporate culture / drama / etc.
 The work itself has always been something that comes easy to me. What I mean is, the ability to quickly learn new tech, troubleshoot and understand things I&#x27;ve never used before, and all that related stuff. This last job I had was one where most of the role involved VOIP systems and I came from a mostly VM and infra background. In the last 6 years I&#x27;ve become the &quot;product owner&quot; for almost 14 different PBX systems. I HATE PBX stuff... That&#x27;s been the my biggest takeaway...

                              <span>Hey Everyone,
 Apologies if this is not the right place for this question. I’ve been tasked with finding a way for our floor users to login to shared accounts on the computer with either fingerprint scanners or badge scanners. 
 So in a nutshell, we have many floor PCs in different areas and want to create shared accounts for those areas that only the users designated in that area can login to. We want to use a badge reader or fingerprint scanner to tie the user to a specific shared account which will then login to that shared account when scanned. 
 Does anyone have any input on this, whether it’s possible or not? 
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi,
 The company I work for finally decided we should step away from Outlook for request handling and we get a say (not the final one) in which ticketsystem we will be using. And to use a translated version of a Dutch saying: I can&#x27;t see the forest through all the trees. (There are too much of them to lose overview).
 The one we choose mustn&#x27;t break the bank to much, but other than that we are allowed to suggest any ticketing system we feel would suit our needs. However, from what I can tell, most of them offer the same services with the same quality and for comparable prices. So my question to you all is: Which ticketing system do you use and why should or shouldn&#x27;t we go for that one? One requirement though, it must use/support AzureAD SSO.
 I&#x27;d love to go for a big one like Service-Now or Jira, but I think those options will be shot down due to pricing. For reference, we are ±200 employee commercial company with 5 people in IT (not all 5 do support, but they will get an operator account).
 Can&#x27;t wait to read what you all are using.
 Cheers!

                              <span>Hi r/sysadmin
 I recently started a new job and have been tasked with providing my office with a scan to OneDrive solution. Here’s my issue, my coworker implemented brother’s with web scan in a different office but the issue is that after 10-15 users, each user needs to kick the other off to use it. I don’t think that’s scalable unless you plan on buying multiple MFPs for departments. In the past I was using PinPoint Scan with Kyoceras which I really liked.
 The way I see it is I either implement the solution already in place, or make the call to be different with hopefully the other offices following suit.
 Now, I’m no printer guru so I would love to hear what you all use for printing/scanning to the cloud (OneDrive preferred). I’ve spent a few days doing research on just Brother but I’m not finding much besides the web scan feature.
 Thank you!!

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m trying to achieve a SSO experience for my users and I can&#x27;t make heads nor tails of the setup and where to look for additional information.
  
All devices are AADJ
 RDS servers is cloud based and runs it&#x27;s own AD environment
 AD and AAD are synced- Username and passwords are synced ([username@companyname.root](mailto:username@companyname.root) for M365 and login into the RDS server)
 We currently have Cisco Duo Deployed for all users as an MFA solution on the RDS server and it&#x27;s also de MFA provider for M365.
  
​
 The IT director want&#x27;s to be able to click on a remote desktop icon and be immediately logged into the RDS server, because he feels that there is currently enough security in place that it&#x27;s making it hard for users to login to the server. (yep, he said it)
 ​
 I&#x27;ve checked and found the following guide:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-integrate-with-remote-desktop-services
 Which asked the pre-install de Azure proxy, which can be found here:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application
 I&#x27;ve gone through both these guides, but when I then go to the RDWeb page, we still get the login prompt for that user.When trying to login to the server using an .RDP file.
 So maybe I&#x27;ve done something wrong, has anyone deployed this before and had succes?
 So I&#x27;m currently a bit lost in the SSO Sauce.
 In short:We have a hybrid environment with an RDS server and alle devices AADJ and we would like to achieve SSO to the RDS using MSTSC from the AADJ devices.
 Can someone point me in te right direction?
 ​
  
edit: added some clarification
 Edit again: formatting (I&#x27;m an idiot)

 Come now and I see very few posts, or for that matter, hear anything at all about it. 
 Is it forgotten or is it just a product that Microsoft produced that no one wants?

                              <span>There is a great deal of user-generated content out there, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos, but we&#x27;ve generally tried to keep that off of the front page due to the volume and as a result of community feedback. There&#x27;s also a great deal of content out there that violates our advertising/promotion rule, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos.
 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

                              <span>Hey, there&#x27;s a lot of tutorials out there that show how to block a specific app from installing 
 Does anyone have a tutorial that outlines how to deny all apps from installing?
 We don&#x27;t want our users to be able to install software at all unless it&#x27;s from company portal. 
 Thanks in advance and any help would be much appreciated.

                              <span>Hi all, since a couple of days our Microsoft 365 Defender portal is reporting MS Teams vulnerability CVE-2023-24881 for all computers. We&#x27;re running the latest Teams version, version 1.6.00.18681, which should no longer have this vulnerability. Has anyone seen this vulnerability listed in their Defender portal as well? 
 BTW, I&#x27;m new to Reddit, why can&#x27;t I upload/add a picture to the post. The Image &amp; Video option is greyed out.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, I’m looking into building my first backup server for a Hyper-V host running Veeam and I have some questions regarding the hardware.
 The host currently uses 1.5Tb of data over 3 VMs but that will increase in the near future to approximately 3Tb over 7 VMs. The backup server will be connected over 10G SFP+ to a Meraki Switch and from there to the Hyper-V host.
 1.) How much disk space does the backup server need?
 2.) Should I use SSDs or HDDs?
 3.) I’m thinking of buying a Synology NAS for this and I’m eyeing the RS1221RP+ 8-bay NAS. Is this a good buy or should I consider something else?
 4.) Is RAID 5 with 4 drives (with space for potential expansion) enough?
 Thank you!

 We had a breakdown and decided to purchase a replacement Dell PowerEdge R430.
 We want to take all the drives out of the old server and install them into the replacement server. Can someone please advise what changes we need to make in order to configure RAID correctly and get the server up and running in production?
 I appreciate all the assistance!

                              <span>Hi there,
 Setup:
 Computer A needs to use Computer B to access a network share, login with credentials.
 However our systems change the logins (local admin -&gt; that is used to login to the networkshare) every week. 
 If the credentials are used to connect to the share, will the share asks for credentials later on when the localadmin password is changed?
 If yes we fucked. 
 Kind regards.

                              <span>Hey all. Apologies if this is the wrong place to post, but you guys seem to be a wealth of information. I&#x27;m trying to sync a perforce project with a team in NZ and I&#x27;m based in the UK and no matter what connection I try I&#x27;m getting a hard sync limit of 2mbps up and down. I&#x27;ve tried two different PC&#x27;s and two completely seperate internet connections with different providers.
 The port 1666 is forwarded. All firewall rules are set to allow P4V to access. I&#x27;m not recieving any network or connection errors, it&#x27;s just insanely slow. Our sys admin gave me an IP for the US server and this has the same issue, hard limit of 2mbps. I&#x27;ve tried VPNs.
 My p4 info readout is instantaneous implying theres no issue with connecting to the server. Someone has tried using my account in NZ and it was fine so not an account issue.
 Unfortunately Perforce support still haven&#x27;t replied after a week and our network admin based in NZ isn&#x27;t too familiar with it but can&#x27;t see what the issue could be on his side of things. So reaching out to alternative means. Will happily ping someone a tip if they help me fix this as it&#x27;s really pushing my progress back on the project.
 Cheers!
 Edit: Running Windows 11. Workplace Ethernet connection and two different mobile hotspots have been tried. All yeild a hard sync cap of 2mbps. Zero issues with pulling file lists or connecting to the project in perforce. It&#x27;s purely file transfer that is experiencing the latency. No Kaspersky

                              <span>Hi, just looking for a bit of advice, we have a couple of surface devices In the business, I need to get warranty support on them but they haven’t been registered with Microsoft. 
 I’m hoping somebody on here can let me know what the accepted method of gaining support for them would be in a business setting. 
 We have a m365 tenant, we also have a single outlook account that has a few licences o. It and is used for some legacy bits and bobs.
 Should I register them on the consumer account or the m365 account? Having never used Microsoft’s warranty support before I’m reticent to wing it , just looking for some advice from people with experience.

                              <span>Looking at buying a used HP MSL4048. They&#x27;re a fair bit old now, but not got much choice as despite having a HP 1000mm rack, the latest gen MSL3040 is 870mm deep so whilst will fit in the rack there&#x27;s no room for the cables.
 My question is, on the MSL4048 I&#x27;m looking at getting it has an odometer showing 8304. I&#x27;ve tried to find online what this means but no luck - any ideas? Is it the hours that the robot has been in use, or the hours the library has been doing backups (e.g. reading/writing to tape). It does have a power on counter, so it won&#x27;t be related to that.
 Also has anyone got experience with these libraries - anything to look out for? Well be using it with 2x LTO6 SAS drives. The library is replacing a si gle drive DELL TL1000 which has an LTO6 drive (hence why I&#x27;m going with the LTO6 in the MSL4048 so we can continue using all the tapes.
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi all,
 ​
 Weird issue here. The monthly Windows CUs frequently trigger Bitlocker to demand a recovery key on boot. Obviously it thinks something has changed, but nothing has changed other than installing the updates. It only happens on our Dell Precision machines, and it doesn&#x27;t happen to every one of them, or every time.
 Anyone experienced anything like this?

                              <span>I&#x27;m part of a small company, less than a hundred employees. (Probably around 600-700 assets) We want to get into Asset Management. 
 We plan to order metal aluminum tags from MyAssetTag or Marverick, but how do we start? 
 Since we want use barcodes/QR codes, do we have to create a database first before ordering the labels? Or do we order the labels and just have whatever software we have to cater to the sequences they end up having? 
 Also what software would be a good fit for us? It&#x27;ll just be physical electronics for now. 
 Thank you

Being a solo show myself I know the difficulties, and I’ll admit it’s been especially challenging for me lately. I have no mentor, no higher up guiding me, no community of IT guys to jive with. Anyone with me on this or am I truly the only sole sysadmin left?

                              <span>I noticed that some of the departments where I work were raging war against one another. There’s been a lot of tension. I came home and started thinking of when every Friday we had a catering order of bagels and spread delivered. I missed that and thought, “Hell, everyone’s having a hard time and fighting against each other. Let’s remember bagel day!”
 So I placed a catering order on my own dime. Bagels aren’t that expensive lol. I had it placed to be delivered before I start but when a majority of the people are there.
 I came in and people were super suspicious about the bagels and created their own private detective agency to find the man that ordered these bagels.
 Shows how good the people I work with are since my name was on the boxes lol. Once they figured out we had a good laugh. 
 The only thing that bothered me was, they kept asking “Why?” Why ask? I was just trying to be nice lol. 
 I’m just trying to look out for my users…

                              <span>Hi I currently have one of my interfaces for wireless set to 10.1.1.1/25 and will be changing to 10.1.1.1/24. I have three systems that are static that I will login to and change the subnet mask to /24 will this cause any issues to my network clients as the rest are DHCP so as it renews it will get the new subnet masks. Currently at /25 my gateway is to 10.1.1.1 and don&#x27;t have anything beyond 10.1.1.20 
 Thoughts?

I never thought about it being a career until a year ago. As I did more research, I met some people who work in Networking, came to a decision I’d like to get into the networking realm of IT. Present day I am studying for my CCNA while I work my warehouse job that pays well and will give me the schedule I need to study. Now to my question, can anyone assist me in telling me what an entry level networking IT job would look like? I’m familiar with the roles of a Network engineer but that’s far away from where I’m at clearly. Just looking for the peoples word on what an Entry level Networking job would consist of or look like. Thanks to anyone willing to give me insight or tips🤷🏼‍♂️

 Not about learning specific tool or specific programming language, but on the procedure, process and workflow design aspects.

I&#x27;m having difficulty identifying the specific IP address or user responsible for consuming excessive bandwidth. Despite checking the Wi-Fi controller, there doesn&#x27;t seem to be significant usage there. There are a few servers that have undergone DNAT (Destination Network Address Translation), but I&#x27;m uncertain if any of the publicly accessible IP addresses subjected to DNAT are consuming an excessive amount of bandwidth. Could you recommend the most effective monitoring tool to help me identify the source of this issue?

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I have some servers out in the field for work that are up and running and I need to schedule some firmware updates on them. I&#x27;d like to just use the Lifecycle Controller since it&#x27;s more automated, but I&#x27;m wondering if there&#x27;s a way to access it without having to reboot the server? Obviously I&#x27;ll have to reboot once the updates are happening, but I wanted to hop into the LCC first to see what updates are available. I was even thinking if I could see there wasn&#x27;t any major updates required I could just do some of them manually through iDRAC.
 Hopefully that all makes sense....
 Thanks!

 I had a bit of a weird interaction today at work, I&#x27;m a developer and do a lot of DevOps. We have a guy from another team setting up some hardware for us that a load of docker containers will be hosted on. 
 I got chatting to him and he mentioned he had configured several IPs to the MAC address (he called them aliases but I think they&#x27;re ARP cache settings?). As a more software oriented person, I asked what the advantages were compared to using a reverse proxy and didn&#x27;t really have an answer. 
 From a configuration basis, are either inherently more secure/stable/expandable? 
 My initial instinct was it was going to create more work than setting up Nginx to handle the routing and ssl rather than doing it on every service, but that&#x27;s just how I&#x27;ve seen it done before.

The job market has been kinda bad lately. When I’m on LinkedIn I see sooooo many posts for network engineers but very few for network admins or just jobs that fit my level of networking experience. I’ve been thinking about getting a new cert to boost my ability to be hired. Do you think it’s too early to get my CCNP? Or maybe I should go for a Palo cert or cloud? Any advice? Thanks!

                              <span>After working with a few of the older engineers, they just always come across as pissed off. Does anyone have a quick and dirty answer for this behavior? Was that just how everyone acted back then in the industry and that isn&#x27;t true for all of them? It seems to be a common trend among network engineers.
 ​
 Thanks,

 EDIT: 
 I did not expect this amount of attention, and this issue seems to be very poliarzed based on reading the answers provided. It&#x27;s a rough generalization to make, but I wanted to find out if others were in the same boat as far as being younger and working in telecom.

What are the best programs out there that y’all can recommend to help me gain only the knowledge I need to obtain the cert before September 15th?

                              <span>So, recently I deployed a new location. one of many I&#x27;ve done in the last few years. in this specific location when a user places a call out the user can hear other users talking through their device as if the other users were conferenced together or something; but they&#x27;re not.I just talked to a user who specifically said that no one else was even on the phone yet when they went to place a call in the period before the call is actually being placed but but after the number is dialed they can hear typing and people talking as if they were on a conference call.I made the assumption that this was crosstalk caused by crossed lines as these PSTN lines come in over FXO ports. but the carrier came in and said this is not the issue. I verified all of my locations all have the same settings on their gateways so I&#x27;m at a loss. anyone else experience this issue?
 ​
 i should mention this is using Cisco IRS4431 gateway, and connected to CUCM.

                              <span>We are going from traditional cisco wifi with 3 on-prem controllers, and enterprise RADIUS (user and certificate auth) to a fresh new meraki deployment.
 The 3 controllers are at 3 different sites, mostly for redundancy and licensing (only 25 licenses per controller).
 Each site is on their own subnet (10.150.1.x, 10.170.1.x, 10.180.1.x, etc) for the secure SSID, and a separate vlan for the guest wifi at each site.
 Going into the meraki deployment with no on site controllers...what is the simplest deployment for performance, security, and management?
 I assume we wouldnt want to do the &quot;Meraki AP assigned&quot; mode, where all clients get a 10.0.0.0/8 address.
 And do you make your wifi network one network? Assume theres no point in making each site its own network.

                              <span>Are there any know issues with using static routes with BFD or any known failure modes that I should take into account before implementing?
 Assume a switch which supports static routing with BFD directly connected to two routers. The routers also support static routing with BFD and the routers talk to each other via OSPF or iBGP.
 Compared to an scenario where the switch supports OSPF, are there any major differences that one should account for?

 I&#x27;m looking at these two, do you have other recommendations or tips?
  
HPE Aruba Instant On 1960 48G PoE
 MikroTik CRS354-48P-4S+2Q+RM
  
I&#x27;ve also looked at the Cisco Business 350 series, but I&#x27;m not sure of their licensing/cloud requirement.
 Any help is appreciated!!

                              <span>Hi,
 I am after some guidance/advise on implementing OSPF for one of our customers and I&#x27;m getting a little confused with the design implementation options. To give some background, we have a customer which has 1 main site and 4 branch sites (5 sites total). Each of those sites has their own VLANs that site on their core switches, and then there is a static default route (0.0.0.0/0) pointing to the firewall. On each firewall there is a VPN to the central site for accessing services etc. The drawback to this implementation is that there is no &#x27;inter-site&#x27; routing at the minute and to access another site you need to go out from the central site. 
 With this in mind, I&#x27;m looking to implement OSPF but just not sure on how to design this, would all 5 sites sit in area 0, or would the main site be area 0 and the other 4 sites be their own respective areas? As I say, each site has their own core switches which the VLAN interfaces reside on so there are technically 2 x L3 devices (core switches and firewalls) at each site. I plan to use IPsec VPNs for the interconnectivity and utilise VTIs on the tunnel ends. I&#x27;ve tried to read up on this and view example topologies and although I understand the fundamentals of OSPF, I seem to be missing the very basics of a real world deployment!
 Any guidance on this would be greatly appreciated.
 Thank you.

Bandwidth is getting used up to much, so we decided to put the 3 switches and their devices in a multicast group. IGMP is enabled on all 3 Switches. Whats the next step?

                              <span>Hi,
 With all big vendors primary focusing on cloud or expensive onprem management (Cisco DNAC, Aruba Central etc), how does government and public agencies handle that? Do you still use old management (Cisco Prime, Aruba Airwave)? How do you see on the future of this?

                              <span>Layoff in the forecast and not sure what to focus on. Recently, I let my CCNP expire as i thought my job was safe, and was focusing on Cloud and SRE. 
 What do you think will sail me long. I have been in Networking for almost 20 years and had several CCNAs and CCNP(Routing and Switching, Security, DevNet and Wireless). I am gearing up resources for CCDE or SRE or CISSP, as there are few job openings for Sr. Network Engineer in my area (The Bay Area)
 Through work, I have PluralSight and CBT Nuggets, and I personally got Cloud Academy&#x27;s subscription. I couldn&#x27;t decide what to start on. What do you think will last loner and have decent life balance. I am a technologist and loves new way of addressing networking problems and love slick solutions, but getting tired of fire drills as i age
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;m hoping to be pointed in the right direction for good documentation or design for redundant data center active-active internet edge that meets the following criteria:
  
Large dark fiber WAN with dozens of interconnected branch offices, no direct-to-internet
 All traffic to internet flows through the two (or more) data centers
 Data centers are geographically separated by 20 miles, but are connected by redundant dark fiber
 Active-active design is desired where outbound traffic can be load balanced, but also fail over to support one another
  
Currently the second data center is mostly failover only, with redundant equipment setup as standby or not existing at all in some cases. Capability for stretched layer2 is there via VXLAN/Cisco ACI. The second DC does have its own separate ISP circuits that are using the dark fiber to stretch layer-2 to the first DC in order to utilize it on the internet load balancer.

 The discovery worked with netconf...however.
 None of the AP&#x27;s show up and Inventory shows the WLC but show &quot;internal error&quot; under Manageability.
 Working with TAC, we have tried the following.
 Rediscover the WLC
 Correct any odd or additional odd characters in the WLC name under AP properties.

                              <span>I&#x27;m just starting to familiarize myself with SONiC and I&#x27;m wondering how those of you who are using it interface with it. From the documentation it seems like it has some sort of REST API (maybe RESTCONF?) and also gNMI support, but there is a surprising lack of focus on programatic interfaces in the documentation.
 How do you guys do it?

 A bit about us to set the context (feel free to skip): We have ~5k users, with a large campus (roughly 80-90% of employees are here), and about a dozen small(er) remote offices globally (mostly EU &amp; US). Work from home is embraced widely. On the server/app side we have a mix of on-prem DC (at the main campus), private cloud environments and SaaS - so all over the place :-). The on-prem DC will remain critical for the foreseeable future, although there is a cloud first strategy so SaaS will increase. We are currently a Palo Alto shop, but have no investment in SD-WAN yet. We have a strong relationship with Mic…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to understand the behavior of how the baystack/nortel/avaya/extreme system works for vlanning in the following config:
 vlan configcontrol flexible
 vlan port 1 tagging unTagAll
 vlan members 2,3,4,5 1
 vlan ports 1 pvid 2
 This would make port 1 an access port, with vlans 2,3,4,5 on it, and a PVID of 2. But an access port shouldn&#x27;t really have multiple vlans on it. I&#x27;ve seen configs where this is used as an alternative to untagPVID for VoIP or an inverse of the pvid with tagPVIDOnly.
 It seems like the device on the port would be able to communicate on its PVID vlan, but only be able to receive broadcast from the other vlans. untagall should strip all the 802.1q tags, so i&#x27;m not sure what vlan it&#x27;s supposed to be communicating on. My best assumption is the PVID.
 Does anyone have experience with this?

                              <span>Hey all,
 Has anyone switched from Palo Alto to Fortinet? We&#x27;re in the EDU sector so pricing is a significant factor. I love the Palo and have had no issues for 6 years. But, we&#x27;re coming up to our next refresh. For those who have migrated how did that go? Were there hiccups or roadblocks you ran into? How is support vs. Palo? How is just general day-to-day management? Anything else that I should be thinking of or insight you can provide would be appreciated!

                              <span>Hey everyone, I&#x27;m working on some lab stuff with the Cat9KV image from CML. It&#x27;s beta code and not officially or unofficially supported by Cisco so they won&#x27;t even answer questions about it.
 One of the published restrictions is you can&#x27;t change the burned in serial number...but I also know some engineers at Cisco who say they use it in their labs with different serials, so there&#x27;s got to be some way to modify it very unofficially.
 Has anyone here done that, or know how I would potentially go about it?

                              <span>I work in a pretty simple break fix role and my understanding of networking stops at the physical layer. About the most I do beyond that is assign statics and ping addresses.
 For the last couple months when a device is offline it doesn&#x27;t return request timed out but instead gives me a reply from an IP that is way different than the scheme we are using. Its not a massive issue as I can quickly recognize an incorrect IP for our network. But it has me very curious as to why this is happening and if its fixable? Nobody in my dept seems to have any idea what I&#x27;m talking about. I&#x27;m hoping maybe someone here could provide insight. 
 edit: after looking at rule 4 I wanted to also mention that I have tried clearing dns and that his happens whether I&#x27;m on site or VPN.

                              <span>Trying to help an overseas office troubleshoot an issue. Unfortunately I have very limited information about their environment, and at this point I don&#x27;t even know where to start. Any thoughts or direction would be so appreciated. 
 Office is located in India. When a users laptop is connected to the wired LAN, no issues. When the same laptop is connected to the wireless network the Network Connection indicator shows no internet, but users can connect and browse, although its slow and Outlook drops connection intermittently. Wireless and Wired are on different subnets. 
 Doing an nslookup on the wired network to msftconnecttest.com gets a reply address based in India. Same nslookup on the wireless network gets a reply address based in Singapore. 
 If we update the host file on the laptop with the local address for msftconnecttest.com, the wireless network shows connected with no browsing issues, so this has to be DNS related, right??
 Again, any thoughts, direction, have you seen this before, even commiserating on this would be so appreciated!

                              <span>Some of my co workers are convinced that newer model media converters we are using are storing mac addresses like a switch would. Reason for this assumption is we have noticed that if we unplug the device on the media converter and then plug in a second device, the second device will not authenticate, because the switch is still seeing the first mac. The fix for this seems to be power cycling the media converter. Shutting and no shutting the switch interface does not seem to fix it, only power cycling the media converter.
 We actually had a device that was connected and failing mab authentication, but even when the device was removed, we still saw logs populating on the switch saying the device was failing. Personally, I was thinking this could be something with DHCP snooping still holding the mac in the database, or maybe some kind of AAA thing. But I really dont see how a media converter could be holding a mac, unless im wrong. 
 Does this make any sense at all? I was always under the assumption that all media converters are layer 1 devices, and they in no way store any information at all.

 I have a conundrum I can&#x27;t wrap my head around and I&#x27;m not finding too much on the ol&#x27; Google that is really helpful. I think what I need isn&#x27;t going to work, but was hoping someone in here could confirm for me or point me to a guide. 
 I need to extend a VLAN from my data centre to a remote site while keeping the same subnet over VPN. I have a Cisco 5545 ASA at the DC and a FirePower 1010 at the remote office. 
 From some reading, this does not sound possible over an ASA. I have seen others using some routers with L2TPv3 to make this work, even from behind an ASA in some cases. 
 Anyone have any suggestions or ideas or any reading material I can review? Thanks.

 I have an Edgerouter ER-X and U6 mesh AP. 
 I want to set up the router for use with digital mixing consoles (sound engineering) such as Yamaha QL etc. and control via the iPad app. 
 I&#x27;ve watched a few videos on the ER-X setup, but most are for creating a home wifi network that is connected to the internet. 
 I am currently connecting to my MBP over Ethernet to port Eth1, I have access to the router on 192.168.1.1 
 I&#x27;m not understanding how to setup a WLAN and the U6 as an AP and have the router act as a DHCP server when I plug it in to the console so it is discoverable by the iPad.
 Any help is greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Hello, I am currently doing some self study on a pair on Cisco 2911 routers and trying to get more familiar with establishing a secure VPN between them. As this is mostly covering open standards I am hoping that this is the more appropriate place to ask these questions.
 I am struggling to find answers from Google and have reached out to another network engineer who isn&#x27;t sure either.
 Once I have configured a secure ISAKMP connection between devices, I am aware that the device then negotiates an appropriate IPsec policy to follow. However going through the system help and exploring available commands, I have noticed that you can define an IPsec transform set without specifying most of the IPsec framework.
 As an example, I have made an IPsec transform set with the following command.
  
crypto ipsec transform-set TEST-TUNNEL esp-3des
  
The only things that have been defined from the IPsec framework from this command is the protocol type (esp) and the confidentiality (3des). I have not defined integrity, authenticity or the diffie-hellman group. Yet the iOS has accepted my command regardless and has created the transform set.
 How does the system make up for half the framework being unconfigured? Does it take it from the existing ISAKMP policy? A system default policy? Just create a tunnel without any of those policies applied or would it be unsuccessful?
 In addition i&#x27;ve seen the command comp-lzs as an option, though iOS does not allow me to create a map exclusively with this alone. From Googling I have seen that it has something to do with compression and should not be used alongside voice or video, though are there any good resources that can explain the lzs algorithm and its application in laymans terms?

 For example, we have the following VLANs setup : 
 Teacher: Vlan 5 Office Staff: Vlan 6 Smartboard: Vlan 7
 Teacher and Office staff shall have the capability to discover and connect to the smartboard.
 However, under our current configuration, unless their device is also on Vlan 7, the smartboard is not discoverable. 
 Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 Has anyone had experience configuring BFD on Nexus switches via Nexus Dashboard (NDFC/DCNM). Is it necessary to create new policies/templates for these purposes?

                              <span>Some background: The company I work for is fairly small, around 700 people. My job title is technically IT Support Specialist | Mac Admin (I do more sysadmin stuff than I do help desk or T1) Most of the environment is Azure, though we are a Hybrid deployment for reasons that don’t make sense to me. We have 25 ish Macs in the environment mostly Apple Silicon. Our current MDM is Intune and it sucks. We just went through the process of evaluating some MDM solutions for Mac and decided on Jamf. 
 Now, I’m not the most savvy person when it comes to Macs, but I have the most knowledge on the team. Which only makes sense that my boss asked me to do the full integration of Jamf and Apple Business Manager. I’ve started the process, but since we’re hybrid, I’m concerned about certificate pushing and a few other things that are mainly handled by our On-Prem Certificate issuing server. For those who have experience with this, how hard is it to integrate Jamf with a Hybrid environment be Azure only? I want to get this right the first time around.

                              <span>Hi Sysadmin team, 
 I am going into a meeting shortly with a Security firm and they are pushing quite a lot of new tech onto our relatively small company. I am all for further tightening our security but I just want to know from some long term experts if they are pushing enterprise grade solutions onto a small family company. 
  
Less than 100 users
 On-prem AD + Azure AD
 Web based apps utilized, not self hosted
 Sophos EDR + firewall currently used
 By next financial we will retire all servers and push everything cloud based
  
They are pushing:
  
SIEM solution (not against this, but who&#x27;s going to monitor?) (AT&amp;T’s USM)
 MVS - Managed Vulnerability Scanning (Is this covered with an MDR or not?) (They will provide this)
 Netskope SASE (is this overkill?)
 MDR (SentinelOne) (I would prefer to stick with Sophos solution MDR)
  
Would love some advice here

 I&#x27;m curious if this is becoming part of a new norm in hiring. Am I wrong for being offended by this? I understand companies have hundreds of applications to sift through, but I feel it&#x27;s a bit degrading.

                              <span>Just curious. Do many of you ever get interviews from applying to jobs online? My experience is that I only get interviews from recruiters contacting me first, usually from LinkedIn.

                              <span>We&#x27;re a smaller company (200 endpoints, 20 servers), and are looking to move to InTune/365 for workstation management (and MDM). Seems to make total sense, and we don&#x27;t have complex management requirements, and we&#x27;re already licensed for it.
 Our current environment is pretty simple and &#x27;traditional&#x27; - machines joined to a domain, a couple simple GPOs, and some third party patching and inventory apps. All Win10, but looking to move to Win11 later this year and next:
 I have a bunch of questions that I&#x27;m having a bit of a hard time nailing down and getting conflicting answers:
  
If we enroll a PC, it looks like it still stays on the domain... At that point I guess we just... disable GPOs (and move them into InTune)? I presume InTune should become the single source of truth for management/policies? 
 User Profiles - If we enroll a device and they&#x27;re still joined to the domain - I presume they keep the existing user profile?
 A user gets a new PC (Win10 or 11) - Should it even be joined to the domain at that point? Is there any value add anymore?
 Virtually all of our apps are web apps - except for a traditional file share (Z: drive) - I know a non-domain machine can still connect to a file share (they would need to manually put in their creds)... Anything to be aware of here? (We want to get rid of this file share, most of our stuff is in sharepoint, but we still have a legacy LOB app requiring it for now - looking to get away from that next year).
 Servers - Can stay on the domain (and probably need to), but what are you all doing for management of servers (eg. patching)? I know Azure has autopatch and a few things, but that seems very... limited in behavior.
  
Anything else we should be aware of? Seems simple from a certain standpoint, but also completely different than what we&#x27;ve been used to doing for 25 years.

                              <span>Hi guys
 I am trying to find a website which is posting all microsoft news which is attempting to sysadmins.
 I found something simular for developers (its in german: https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/techwiese/default.aspx), but not for sysadmins.
 I found the newsletters (https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/techwiese/newsletter/default.aspx), which are for IT Pros. Thats a start, but I think there have to be a news site for sysadmins from microsoft, or not?
 The goal is to be up to date as a windows sysadmin. The most other news sites are full with unnecessary news, like gaming and other stuff, just to produce content (with no sense).
 Best regards
 ​

 Any scripts which have to do with rebooting, such as weekly reboot, nightly are just firing off over and over.
 Almost every server and workstations at all of our clients is affected.
 Anyone else in the same boat?

                              <span>Afternoon all,
 When I started in my current role there were next to no protections in place on basically anything to do with IT. I&#x27;m going to list the major things I have implemented, could you wonderful people let me know if there&#x27;s anything missing?
  
Conditional access policy to only allow access from the UK (all our staff are remote working, but UK only)
 Sophos AV on every machine
 Sophos spam filter on every inbox 
 Rebuilt SharePoint environment to manage permissions 
 Only allow use of Microsoft Edge
 Whitelist of which Edge extensions are permitted 
 Web filter to block malicious sites
 Block USB storage devices 
 SSO on everything where possible (and within budget) else 2FA implemented 
 Sophos Firewall in all office sites 
  
I think that about sums it up. 
 What industry standard protections am I missing?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello fellow sysadmins! I’m reaching out to see if anyone has implemented the cloud Kerberos trust model for hybrid azure ad joined devices? I’m managing from Intune and got workstation logins working. I also completed early testing of Remote Credential Guard to get RDP access working. But I’m stuck at on-prem auth prompting with Windows Integrated Security. It prompts for PIN, I enter, and it prompts again. One example in my enviromemt is with Windows Admin Center Gateway. I’m think something is amiss, but I can’t put my finger on it. It’s worth mentioning I have 1 Windows Server 2022 DC promoted and the rest are 2012 (to be replaced). 
 Any insight would be appreciated! 
 Thanks, JB

 My question is how often should we backup the HSM.

 so the problem is, as I wrote in the title, when I recieve an email with an attachment and then try to forward that email, when you get prompted to the next window, all of the text is blank, just dissapears, so there&#x27;s basically nothing to forward. Anyone else had this issue? This is happening just on the Outlook mobile application.

 At the moment I browse my logs from the server manually. I&#x27;m thinking about a dedicated open-source app for it, like Logwatch. I want access to a panel or email report with basic information, such as who is trying to connect to my server on which port, attempts to DDOS, etc.
 Which app is best for it, or maybe it would be better to write a bash script for it?
 I want a simple solution configuration, like Grafana plus Prometheus, which is too complicated for me at the moment.

 No need to post your vendor here if your contract prevents that disclosure, but if there is a vendor that’s not mentioned below, I’ll edit this post to include them in the list. 
 SD-WAN providers I know of.

                              <span>We are going to force a group of users to re-register their MFA and push them to use MS Authenticator. Right now my strategy is to do so as below:
 1.) In Azure AD user account, select require re-register multifactor authentication and revoke multifactor authentication sessions. 
 2.) In O365 Admin Portal, sign out of all sessions. (We find we need to do this as the requirement to login and see the MFA registration is taking to long and need the change to be immediate. 
 ​
 Does this make sense? I&#x27;m contemplating not doing the revoke multifactor authentication steps as it may be redundant, but I think it makes sense to cover all bases as we want them to re-register MFA completely and authenticate again.

                              <span>Warning Small Rant Inbound, ignore if this kind of post isn’t you’re thing:
 Ah, the common question that we all get asked the second we have a small moment of downtime. Oh, finally have a moment to catch up on previous projects? Or have a few hours to train a new employee? Or simply having time to catch a breather after putting out fires all week? Fuck you, doesn’t matter because you’re not a boastful, loud-about-his-work schmuck and simply prefer to fix computer issues and keep it pushing to the next. 
 This is exactly my (and a lot of other admins’) gripe when it comes to more customer facing roles. In previous years, my position has been held by 3 people, then 2, then finally just me being the solo admin when i got onboarded. I guess now they’re wondering “hmm why even have an sysadmin at this point?”
 I got my experience that I wanted with this company and it’s about that time I start looking for another job anyways. When I go, they will finally get what they want and have no admin in office. Maybe they’ll see exactly what we “do” then lol.
 Hopefully I can break into a cyber/less customer facing role for this next one.

                              <span>This one is a first for me. A user stated that their computer (Windows 10 22H2) is showing a blue screen that says &quot;Select account&quot;. In that list of accounts, it is showing a domain admin account that has never been used to log into that computer with. I also checked, it&#x27;s not a local account either. They selected &quot;Restart&quot; and it went into a disk repair and booted fine. They restarted again and the blue screen came back up.
 Since I can&#x27;t get into the office today, I had them unplug the computer and disconnect it from the network because I&#x27;m paranoid.
 But, I&#x27;m not quite understanding how it can reference a domain admin account that 1. has never been used to log into that computer with and 2. while the computer is not connected to the network.
 Thoughts?

                              <span>Hi SysAdmins,
 We have 2000+ laptops with the employees, the most complaints I get from my team when employees reach out to IT desk are 1, How dirty they keep the laptops, not sure if they travel while work or work from Kitchen or use laptop as food plate, 2, saving the files on the desktop, not even a place to save new file or right click.
 So I am thinking of pushing wallpaper to keep the laptops clean (physically) and clean desktop (For security reason as they also save confidential files and passwords).
 I need help with the wallpaper suggestion, like did you guys ever sent something like that or any suggestion with the content I need to keep.
 Any help is fine. Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all,
 Our current domain Maximum Password Age is set to 365 days via Group Policy. I&#x27;m trying to find out if there&#x27;s anything to consider when changing this setting to 0 days so passwords never expire (we implement MFA), namely if this will force a password change. I can&#x27;t seem to find a definitive answer on this, wondering if anyone else has done it.
 Cheers

                              <span>Nowadays most of the software tends to have web-interface (which I admit is much better than having crappy client software) but this makes it a burden to keep track of and update certs needed to access these web interfaces.
 Examples of such software - various controllers (unifi, aruba), printers and/or printing software (for example I have YSoft SafeQ). Some of them are on various distributions of linux, some of them are on windows by are ported from linux (i.e. they do not utilize windows certificate manager and it&#x27;s autorenewal capabilities but rather use a traditional linux way - say tomcat config file that references cert file and key in a folder).
 Over years this becomes especially more important task to solve with the tendency to reduce maximum certificate validity period.
 What are you guys doing there?
  
Do you write custom scripts for each specific service?
 
Do you update these certs manually (once every X month/years or when your monitoring tells you to)
 
Do you completely ignore the need to use certificates and instead use no cert or provided by service self-signed certs?
 
 And if you do automate the renewal (especially interested for the case with onprem Windows CA to linux webservers) - then how are you doing it?

                              <span>Hey all,
 Looking for a good remote access solutions to PC all within the same LAN. Here&#x27;s the catch though... none of them can get out to the internet. We have servers that can get out, and the hope is that we can deploy a remote access solution that we would be able to access the machines across the network jumping through the server. Essentially we&#x27;d use a solution like TeamViewer to instigate a session to the server, and would want to jump to the deployed machines from there. 
 We have been using Windows remote desktop connection in the interim, however, this isn&#x27;t a good solution for this use case as the machine gets logged out when disconnecting from the session, making things more difficult on the user. 
 Anyone have any experience in deploying a remote access solution that works just across the LAN? Like I said, opening up the network to allow these machines out to the internet is NOT something we can do in this instance. 
 Thanks sysadmins!

                              <span>Venting here because my KPI for the year was absolutely fucked by a mistake made by our SDWAN provider.
 I called them up yesterday to get a new SSID added to all of our manufacturing sites. This is a real simple thing that didn&#x27;t require any complex routing or anything, it&#x27;s basically a secondary guest Wi-Fi, right? No big deal.
 Some fuckknuckle logged into the centralized manager for all the firewalls and apparently clicked push to two of our primary manufacturing sites without paying any attention to what he was doing. This pushed two old configuration files to those sites which overwrote half of the SSIDs that were already in place and vital to our 24/7 manufacturing. You&#x27;d think this was easily fixable by rolling back to the previous nights stored config, right?

                              <span>Hi All,
 We have a customer running a product called Autodesk Vault on an AWS instance (Windows Server 2019). Recently they have been experiencing really poor performance on the software and we&#x27;ve been trying to get to the bottom of it. 
 The software is file storage / BLOB vault with clients connecting to it via a IIS web application layer. The customer has about 3 users on the system so it&#x27;s not a huge deployment and the vault database is about 150gb (140gb of BLOB and 10gb of database spread across ~ 15 MDF) 
  
The instance is idling most of the time on CPU ( &lt;10% usage)
 It&#x27;s using less than 40% available memory. I&#x27;ve checked SQL server and it&#x27;s using about 1/4 of the available 1.4gb shared memory pool
 Network speed tests are very good (as you would expect from AWS)
 Disk activity doesn&#x27;t appear very high but...
  
Having checked everything with the developers, the problems seemed to be stemming from the database. We&#x27;ve upgraded the storage from &quot;gp2&quot; tier to gp3 and doubled the IOPS and throughput from 900 IOPS / ~250MB/s to 5000 IOPS / 500MB/s.
 Having done all this its running a bit better but not dramatically better. It&#x27;s not clear though if it is the storage which is the bottleneck or if something else is going on.
 The server currently runs MS SQL Express 2019 but we&#x27;re nowhere near hitting the memory pool limit and it doesn&#x27;t appear like its getting thrashed. I just wondered though if there are any other limits/issues which could be causing this version of SQL Server to be causing problems? 
 Does anyone know if upgrading to MS SQL Server Standard 2019 offers any performance benefits over Express for general SQL work loads?

 I&#x27;ve got two Windows VMs at two different sites on separate internet connections that need to communicate securely for a PowerBI solution we have. Both VMs are also accessible by their respective networks.
 My understanding is I can set up an OpenVPN server at site A and install the client on the VM at site B. Providing we configure the firewall correctly, that should do it?
 Is this a suitable solution or should I be looking for something else to accomplish it?

                              <span>Hello!
 I have a batch pool that gets created from a python function inside function app - and I need some advice, as I am newbie and I feel like I cant find this information, or I don&#x27;t know where to look.
 My batch account is inside a vnet, and initially my batch pool was created with no network configuration. The nodes ended up in an unusable state everytime because &quot;the batch agent extension provisioning has failed on compute node&quot;. I also didnt see the vms being allocated inside any of my subnets, so then I explicitly created it in one of my snets. I did see them allocated in that subnet, but the &#x27;unusable&#x27; result was the same. I have no private endpoint for the vms, and the policy of my organization does not allow opening the RDP port publicly, so I cant use RDP to test anything in the vnet. But before configuring the batch to be created in the subnet, I connected to the vm and it seemed like nslookup did find the DNS of the storage account for the batch. However, the resource files are not being downloaded to the VMs from the storage account. The NSGs are already configured and the ports should be fine. Can anyone please give a helping hand?

                              <span>Hello, I am new to the sub, I have a PowerEdge r510 server, which does not start correctly, the BIOS logo is stuck, I already tried resetting the ram and flash memory and half cleaning a little hahaha and the power supplies are fine, the leds They are green, but it keeps giving me the same error, it does not boot, I have not tried removing the battery from the BIOS and see if I am successful, I already tried to do a power cycle to try to make it start, follow the following steps:
  
Shut down the server.
 
Disconnect the power cables and everything connected externally (mouse, keyboard, floppy drive...).
 
Press the power button for 30 seconds.
 
Leave the server powered off for 5 minutes.
 
Reconnect the power cables and turn on the server. I already tried to reset the NVRAM_CLR with this post https://www.dell.com/support/kbdoc/es-mx/000128677/c%C3%B3mo-reestablisher-el-bios-de-un-servidor-dell- poweredge and I didn&#x27;t succeed :( or I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m doing it wrong but according to me yes, it follows the BIOS logo loop, and the back LED blinking in orange color has an &quot;i&quot; icon and I also noticed that on the card where the flash memory is, a green LED flashes that says SYS HB/ERROR and it stays like that all the time, I don&#x27;t know what it means, I searched the net and nothing :(I ended up stressing myself for a while and I no longer care I continued, I had other jobs to do, well I hope someone has had the same thing happen to them and can help me, sorry for my English, I don&#x27;t write natively, I&#x27;m using a translator: s

                              <span>Hey folks several of my users are reporting problems with repeating keys and other keyboard weirdness after the most recent patch Tuesday. The common thread I&#x27;m seeing is that all are using Logitech wireless keyboards- some via the USB wireless dongle, and others connected via bluetooth. The problem seems to occur most frequently right after booting- after a bit, it appears to go away (possibly associated with logging in).
 Is anyone else seeing similar weird behavior with wireless keyboards after patch Tuesday?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 So currently using bittitan to do a tenant to tenant migration (SharePoint, OneDrive and Email).
 It seems really slow to me.
 With current estimates migrating 800GB of Sharepoint data of 1 to 1.3GB / hour it will take until somewhere in August, is this normal?

 I&#x27;m trying to get Hyper-V up and running, though I can&#x27;t seem to find the correct credentials for &quot;XRDP&quot; when trying to launch Ubuntu.
 I&#x27;ve looked into where I obviously thought they would be, in the Credential Manager. However they don&#x27;t seem to be working? I&#x27;ve tried every combination, networks set to private, turned off Hello sign in.
 Thing is it says &quot;No Windows Credentials&quot; in the manager? though I&#x27;m signed in with a Microsoft account. My user, and pass should work right? Or am I missing something? can I just add my own credentials?
 Any way to bypass if all else fails? This is stumping me so hard.

                              <span>Hey fellow friends.
 I&#x27;m currently facing a dilemma and could use some guidance from our sysadmin and fellow Redditors. 
 Our organization business is healthcare. We have a diverse workforce comprising employees, contractors, and a third-party outsourced team of developers who need access to our resources hosted at on-prem data centers. Compromised of mix devices BYOD and Corporate managed. Typically, contractors and 3rd Party outsourcing companies will use their own company-provided devices. However, I&#x27;m having trouble deciding on the best solution for secure remote access.
 Legacy VPN and direct IT resources are a definite &quot;hell no&quot; for me, as they seem outdated and potentially risky. I&#x27;ve been researching alternatives solution, namely, Cloud hosted VDIs and ZTNA, but I&#x27;m still confused about which option would be the right fit for our organization. when it is appropriate to use each of these solutions.
 I would greatly appreciate your insights.

                              <span>As the title says, I am looking at a way to notify sysadmins when service accounts are used to RDP/Log into servers etc, without having the false alerts of when the service accounts are used for their daily operations.
 Any starting points?

                              <span>Hello redditors,
 I hope this post finds you all in good spirits. Today, I come before you as a recent graduate from the esteemed Clark University, where I completed my Master of Science in Business Analytics in May 2023. As an international student who set foot on American soil with boundless ambitions, I possess a deep-rooted passion for problem-solving and critical thinking.
 ​
 However, I find myself facing a daunting challenge as I aspire to carve out a career path in Cloud Engineering. Regrettably, my background lacks the necessary experience and exposure in this particular field. The current market landscape exacerbates my anxiety day by day, as I encounter the disheartening reality of not receiving even a call for the positions I seek as a Business Analyst.

Our IT department is brand new and they moved away from an external IT company a year ago and My current president/CEO states he used an external company to determine what the industry rate for our IT positions are for a Non Profit. They are pretty low compared to other locations.

                              <span>Can I just say that I hate Printers with a passion? Especially HP ones? Hewlett Packard really needs to do some quality control on all of their products. I recently had to unbox and install an HP Printer/Scanner in a controlled environment for work without an internet connection and you would think I was disarming a bomb. I unboxed the Printer, added paper to the tray, closed it and plugged it in. And immediately the printer began printing NONSTOP. Eh you know 5 years in IT and nothing really surprises me like this… it’s definitely the first time I’ve seen something like this. I read the entire manual included. The first issue: the “manual” is only three pages all basically telling you to download the app on your device. Uh oh. No internet. What now? I go to the website. Problem number two…</span>

                              <span>I’m about two months into running a manufacturing plant with roughly 150 critical endpoints and some odd 200+ which run either on our guest network or a VLAN that’s segmented from everything else.
 I’ve put out the vast majority of the fires that needed immediate addressing and conducted a thorough audit of our hardware, and most of it is at least six years old. A couple of weeks ago I retired a server that had software that was installed in 2012.
 Based on quick and dirty math, we have 33x machines in particular that cost us about $104 an hour of downtime and the machines themselves ship with a LTSC version of Windows 7… 
 This leads to my question. How do I pitch a costly hardware upgrade to the company in such a way that it’s obviously the correct business decision? Potential damage the brand, lost revenue from downtime and bringing us up to code with regards to TPM are already on the list, any suggestions?

                              <span>Lumen is reporting a major fiber cut for Miami to Tampa by a construction crew saying 2000ft has to be replaced and goes over a canal or under i guess. Everything is being rerouted but has secondaries overloaded. 
 I don&#x27;t see much news on this yet but this is from a ticket we opened with our provider as it&#x27;s impacting several of our sites in Florida.
 If you have a bunch of latency or weird problems today it might be related.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m a system admin for a growing company, when I started the job 2 years ago I was told I would take care of and maintain about 30-40 VDIs. This quickly evolved into drowning in roughly 200 systems. I was barely keeping these things on the network as the cyber security office is constantly trying to kick off machines that have any vulnerabilities. I finally got my boss to give me another technician and they doubled the amount of machines so no I&#x27;m up to 400 machines and have a new technician who&#x27;s fairly experienced but it doesn&#x27;t match the workload. The systems run across multiple platforms like Citrix, AWS, and Azure, not to mention they each have their own flavor of windows 10. Just feel like.im drowning and no matter what I do I can&#x27;t fix them all.

                              <span>I recently started at a new job as IT admin. The IT manager wants me to setup WSUS, it has not been working for some time. It was setup previously but was not troubleshot when it stopped. When I log onto the WSUS server and open the Windows Server Update Services I get &quot;Database error an error occurred when trying to perform a database operation&quot; the only option is copy error or reset server node. Not knowing much about WSUS where do I even start?
 I&#x27;ve found a few related event logs,
 12022 - The Client Web Service is not working
 10022 - The last catalog synchronization attempt was unsuccessful.
 13032 - Many client computers have not reported back to the server in the 
 last 30 days. 39 have been detected so far.
 I&#x27;ve tried restarting services related to WSUS, and I have also followed a few quick fixes that involved restarting the wsus application pool in IIS. 
 Before I get way too deep down this rabbit hole, is there a better solution being used to maintain updates? Preferably free or included software? I am trying to keep this a low cost or free patch management solution.
 Please let me know what other details I can provide. Any help in the right direction would be most appreciated

                              <span>I work from home. Lately I’ve become really frustrated with how much I’ve been slacking off and procrastinating during work hours.
 I’ve noticed that, whenever I have to solve an issue, especially those that take hours or days to solve, I can work nonstop. I&#x27;ll skip my afternoon snacks, I’ll voluntarily work overtime without pay, etc. The issue occupies my mind 24/7 and I only stop once I’m able to solve it.
 Other times, though, I need to work on planning, documentation and ‘research’ tasks. I know those tasks are important but I keep procrastinating on them. I take much longer to finish than I should. Instead of working on them, I’ll just read books or stare at the screen or browse the Internet. I don’t really know why but I find those kinds of tasks really daunting.
 I did engage in busy work at my former company (in person) but much less often and only when I really had nothing to do. Going to the office is not an option for me because my company is from a different country. I’m considering going to a coworking space but it’s extra money I’d have to pay, plus I would lose a lot of conveniences from WFH.

                              <span>Looks like there&#x27;s a new Windows/Office CVE in the wild that is already being exploited.
 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/07/11/storm-0978-attacks-reveal-financial-and-espionage-motives/
 https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-36884
 There&#x27;s currently no patch available, but a few mitigations:
  
Customers who use Microsoft Defender for Office are protected from attachments that attempt to exploit this vulnerability.
 
In current attack chains, the use of the Block all Office applications from creating child processes Attack Surface Reduction Rule will prevent the vulnerability from being exploited.
 
Organizations who cannot take advantage of these protections can set the FEATURE_BLOCK_CROSS_PROTOCOL_FILE_NAVIGATION registry key to avoid exploitation. Please note that while these registry settings would mitigate exploitation of this issue, it could affect regular functionality for certain use cases related to these applications. Add the following application names to this registry key as values of type REG_DWORD with data 1.:
 
  
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BLOCK_CROSS_PROTOCOL_FILE_NAVIGATION
  
 Excel.exe
 Graph.exe
 MSAccess.exe
 MSPub.exe
 PowerPoint.exe
 Visio.exe
 WinProj.exe
 WinWord.exe
 Wordpad.exe
  
The question is what &quot;certain use cases&quot; the registry entries above could actually affect. Anyone got any insights on this?

 About a year ago I became a manager over the entire Infrastructure team. I asked one of my Network Admins to take me around to all the network closets and ran into this room where we have been experiencing years of mildew problems. I had no clue about this and am shocked that this was the first I was learning about it.
 I spoke to Facilities and they replaced the AC unit last year to try and fix this issue. I have learned that in the past we have experienced outages that were linked back to damage in the patch panel so they had to replace the ports. 
 I would like to clean up this mildew but how? Do I scrubbing with a brush or is it just better to just replace the patch panels? I was thinking this was just a contact issue with the cable but could the cabled be damaged in anyway?

                              <span>I work as an IT manager in this place for 2 years now.
 It&#x27;s a private group of companies, not all of them managed by us, dealing with big data.
 They grouped us IT and Dev together under one company that supports the whole group.
 My direct manager(who is the group CTO and CEO of our &quot;internal company&quot;) is the former Head dev.
 It&#x27;s an old company that made the transit from papers to digital. Most of our services are done by internal apps that support the whole eco system.
 Work is satisfying, with a lot of new things to learn and expand my knowledge and no one has knowledge of IT so I basically do as I want, setting standard for systems, making the budget and such.
 Pretty much my own boss.
 My issue is trying to get things done that involves the dev.
 I try to keep everything in order, …</span>

                              <span>Hi guys. I have the following scenario.
 I have a forest, contoso.com &amp; child.contoso.com. I need to deploy a GPO setting in Computer Configuration\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Policies\User Rights Assignment, to all domain controllers but exclude all read-only domain controllers from the policy.
 I thought of doing it this way: Create a universal security group in child.contoso.com and make all target domain controllers members of this group. Create the GPO in child.contoso.com and apply security group filtering to said group.
 Would this work or is there a better way?

                              <span>We&#x27;ve been using windows file servers with failover clustering for a bit, and have had pretty great uptime on some shares because of this.
 I&#x27;ve been tasked with find a way to expand this setup to be redundant with another physical office/data center, or using VMs in azure, to potentially include both.
 Does anyone have advice on the best route to go?
 Azure files seems like it would work to fulfill the azure requirement, but wouldn&#x27;t help cross-site to the other location.
 Is storage replica the only other alternative or am I missing something?

                              <span>The release of Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK V2 by Microsoft has introduced a new challenge for Microsoft 365 admins - the need to migrate existing scripts once again. Unlike before, the familiar &quot;select-MgProfile&quot; option for switching to the beta profile is no longer available with SDK V2. Instead, admins must install the beta module separately. Furthermore, the v1.0 and beta modules differ in their cmdlet prefixes.
 One reason administrators have heavily relied on the beta profile is its ability to retrieve all the necessary properties, unlike v1.0 which only retrieves limited properties when executing cmdlets. Consequently, previously migrated scripts from Azure AD now require yet another migration effort. The cycle seems never-ending as we navigate these continuous updates and adapt their scripts accordingly.

 Starting that many many many IT professionals don&#x27;t understand DNS. It&#x27;s not a router, it&#x27;s not a loadbalancer (it can perform the dumbest form of round robin, but zero health checks), it&#x27;s not firewall, not a NATs, it&#x27;s not a webserver.... It&#x27;s just a &quot;phone book&quot; that translates names to IPs addresses.... however many professionals don&#x27;t get it.
 Creating a DNS A record, does not magically create the firewall ACLs, router NATs, webserver settings...

 I was wondering if anyone has any recommended hot desk booking software? I&#x27;ve looked into a few but the market is saturated with them it seems. So far I&#x27;ve demoed Envoy, Deskbird and Desknow.. Deskbird is the front runner at the moment.

 One person had everyone show up fine except when they saw a chat with me it said &quot;Unknown User&quot;. They reverted back to the old client and everything started working again.
 I reverted back to the old client for the users I mentioned in the beginning and everyone is showing as Unknown User.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>We&#x27;re in the process of adding our privileged accounts to the Protected Users AD group for security hardening and came across a what if...
 Say a Windows Server is sick and/or has an issue with network connectivity. From my understanding, the Protected Users group prevents credential caching. If the administrator accounts we use to manage the servers are in the group and the server is sick, would we be prevented from logging into said server? Are there any other gotchas similar to this we should be aware of? Thanks!

                              <span>I have been enjoying mobaxterm for several years as I&#x27;m a lite user.
 However, I&#x27;d like to bookmark, more than 10 servers finally and the price is $70 USD, not a small fee. I&#x27;d get about $20 of that back in tax if I was lucky. (No, work won&#x27;t pay for it and I use it for both personal and home)
 ​
 What are people using? I regularly pay for software if I think the price is reasonable, $70 for my basic use just is simply too steep.
 Note, I&#x27;m primarily a windows user unfortunately.

                              <span>Our preferred method of patching is to use Qualys&#x27; Patch Management module due to their cloud agent being present across all the workstations we issue.
 However, we seem to continuously have this battle with trying to disable or at least prevent the native windows update mechanism from downloading and installing the updates/patches each month.
 We run Windows 10 21H2, our desktop team has attempted to push various GPO settings but with little to no affect.
 Does anyone have any first hand experience of this issue, as well as any suggestions or controls/GPOs we are likely missing to allow us to manage updates and patching predominantly using Qualys scheduled patch jobs?
 Thanks in advance!

I&#x27;d like to standardize on a model, dont really care what brand it is. The ERP software company says they support PCL6 but already ran into issues with a brother, so they seem to be out.

                              <span>Did the world of networking on Windows change? For 25 years the network name resolution order has been hosts file first, yesterday we were testing a host file to block tiktok and its not working on 2 of the 5 test machines. The hosts file was pushed via Intune in a PS script to all 5 machines. I looked for stray characters. I looked for spaces ate the begin of lines. The permissions are correct. We can not ping the urls in question after the host file is in place so whats that tell me? It is working but Edge/Chrome/Firefox is doing something different? I thought maybe secure dns, but the 2 machines that done work have SDNS enabled. What am I missing?

                              <span>Hey y&#x27;all, I&#x27;ve tried everything that I could think of so I&#x27;m hoping that someone here can help. I just recently moved over people from a hosting company to 365 for their email. Everything is working great minus trying to send a scan to someone&#x27;s email through SMTP through their multifunction printer. I got the SMTP info and plugged it in and nothing happens. There&#x27;s not even a error. Just to let you know they&#x27;re using two third party apps. One is called office protect and the other is called proof point which I believe may be the issue but I&#x27;m not too sure. Just wanted to put it in there.
 Things that I have done and checked 1. I have made sure that the account that I&#x27;m using to send out of has a business basic license and that SMTP is turned on 2. I make sure that I&#x27;m using TLS not SSL that&#x27;s according to Microsoft&#x27;s official documentation 3. I made the proper connector to allow from partner organization to internal and using their static IP
 If anyone has any information that could help me or at least lead me in the right direction I would be much appreciated.

 The latest update of Cortex to version 8.1.0 fucks around with the printspooler and Xerox drivers on Windows. The printers will vanish from your printerlist and if you want to add them back, an error occurs, saying that the print processor was not found. 
 Our solution was to exclude the spoolsv.exe

I was thinking about using Proxmox-Pfsense-Zentyal-Ubiquiti controller. What do you think? is there a better (free/open source) solution than Zentyal as a server? Any advice on the configuration?
 Server specs:
 HPE ProLiant ML350 Gen10
 Intel Xeon Gold 5218R / 2.1 GHz (4 GHz) (20 core)
 96GB RAM
 4 ethernet ports

                              <span>Hey guys,
 I can&#x27;t find a fix for this problem. In our MDT/WDS Environment, the unattend.xml logs in as the prebuilt &quot;Administrator&quot; account so that the task sequence runs. However, due to our Domain-Administrator account having the same name, after every deployment the Domain-Admin gets locked in AD. The autologon still goes through and everything works, it&#x27;s just the locking of the Domain-Admin that confuses me. This is my current autologon config:

 I&#x27;ve tried leaving it empty, using &quot;.\&quot;, nothing worked.
 Thanks for your help!

                              <span>Hi,
 in september i will start a new job, i will have to create the managed services division for a small consultancy firm.
 My group will manage both the servers and the clienst sides, and i&#x27;m thinking about the tool stack we&#x27;ll need, and i would like to begin studying and using Ansible, that&#x27;s not really used in small companies here in Italy.
 Anyone has real hand-on experience on it? in particular i would like to know if:
 - The reporting features are good or on-par with other tools, e.g. N-able RMM
 - Can be created complex tasks like &quot;initiate a snapshot of the vserver on vmware, only if it&#x27;s ok then start patching it with preapproved patches&quot;
 - It can reimage a remote pc
 ​
 I know the question can be confused, but i would like to have your insights and general tips and tricks, thank you :)

                              <span>I have a fully patched 2019 Windows server standard server running a SQL database application.
 The NIC has a static IP address and DNS set to use the two Domain Controllers.
 IP6 is disabled. Looking at the properties of IP4 shows a DNS server entry of it own IP address as well as the 2 DC&#x27;s. The DNS server role is not enabled on this server. If I delete the erroneous entry it comes back in 20 minutes or after a reboot.
 I have never seen this before and at a loss on how to stop the behavior? 
 All I have been able to do is push down the erroneous DNS server entry down in the list of IP4 DNS servers. 
 Any suggestions?

We&#x27;re upgrading or ERP software so that users now can access this software via a browser and no longer need to RDP onto the server.

How can I also ensure that their login info from websites they use daily will also move over? We use M365(except for on the servers) so how can I get their pst files to work with outlook web?

 Got a user who is trying to access their 365 Outlook via browser, issue is whenever they try they get stuck on a loading screen and the page seems to crash (Goes full white)
 Tried this on multiple different browsers, computers and on different networks but the error persists. 
 Also tried disabling and renabling MFA but the issue is still occuring - anyone got any idea what the fault could be? Tried on Edge, Chrome, Chrome Incognito and my own machine on a different network (I&#x27;m WFH user is office based)

 I read the post and comments to OP&#x27;s question about &quot;what exactly do you automate&quot;.
 Automation is something I&#x27;ve wanted to do for a few weeks but wouldn&#x27;t sit down long enough to understand it. 
 After reading through comments, and a resource someone mentioned, I went to work. I&#x27;ve already begun learning and applying today and the time saved is insane. I&#x27;m still in uni and working at a startup, so you can imagine that I am a bit thrilled. I&#x27;m looking forward to optimizing more of my time. 
 I&#x27;ll be taking two Python courses this year; one being informal by an incredible leader in their field who opted to teach give us a day class on the basics and a formal advanced course in the fall.

 i would just like to put a little disclaimer of sorts here, i&#x27;m not really seeking advice or anything, i just want to know that i&#x27;m not the only one who feels frustrated about this. if you think i&#x27;m wrong please tell me.
 (i posted this as a comment in a post here a little bit ago)
 in switzerland we have the option of pursuing a career in IT by doing an apprenticeship. Usually gets split between 3 days of work and 2 days of vocational school a week, with periodic courses that last 2 weeks and replace work while they take place. in school we learn the theory behind IT concepts, and the courses are mostly practical (sometimes they teach you something that will only come up in school later, like SQL for example, my SQL grade was superb thanks to the course).

                              <span>Hey everyone, former K12 SysAdmin (tier 1 wearing numerous hats) going into IT for a hospital. What are some things that can be expected or would be different than a traditional corporate environment or government ran domain? I assume it&#x27;ll be faster paced than K12 and more Windows intensive rather than MacOS/iPadOS/ChromeOS dependent. Thanks in advance :)

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 What do you guys use for HA with IIS?
 Currently a firewall policy that routes requests to 2 servers.
 But obviously when 1 server reaches 100% load and is no longer processing requests normally the firewall does not pick this up.
 Would like to know what you guys use

                              <span>I own and manage multiple Google Workspaces, and I need help adding one as a secondary to the other. Google support is unwilling to help since AWS is the domain registrar. 
 While attempting to add one as the secondary to the other in Google Workspace, I ran into the issue: “The domain name has already been used as an alias or domain.” Obviously, the message makes sense. 
 The Goal: Example, I have ham.com and egg.com. Both are hosted in AWS. I want Ham to be primary and Egg to be secondary in Google Workspace.
 Can someone provide any guidance on how to get this done?

 I am using Proxmox with SSH tunneling. I have disabled all outside ports and connections, except for access via SSH tunneling.
 In this way, what is my strategy for server hardening?
 My setup:
 - disabled root login
 - use ssh keys instead password
 - do not change the default SSH port, because I do not accept connections apart from tunneling.
 - use fail2ban
 What should I add?

                              <span>I&#x27;m an IT support tech and not a network expert by any stretch, but I know a little more than the basics.
 We have a long building that we essentially consider three buildings in one (A, B, and C) since they are all connected. At the far end of the building is our network closet and throughout the buildings UAPs were installed (2 per building). The two in bldg C went out and I have to trace the cables but I can&#x27;t figure out where they go and all of the connections on the 8-port switch show the link lights are active (I don&#x27;t have any network tools yet). I also ran nslookup on the network and it was able to find the IP addresses and names of all the UAPs, so I was at least able to obtain that information for the two UAPs that are down.
 Whoever installed the network left no documentation and the person I replaced passed away. I don&#x27;t have the login for the Unifi gateway, the router, no cables are labeled, nothing is organized. Anyway, I think the UAPs might run to another switch before going to the switch in the network closet but no one knows where that is located or if that&#x27;s even how it was done. My other thought is that I think the UAP cables might be punched down on the patch panel.
 Is it normal or common practice to run cables between 200 to 500 ft directly from the UAPs and punch them down on the patch panel as opposed to using network drops? I&#x27;ve never seen a setup like this before.

                              <span>It&#x27;s been a long time since I was a network guy and while I&#x27;m 99% I&#x27;m sure of the answer here in the interest of security I wanted to run it by some network experts to ensure this is 100% right. The gear is Unifi USW switches and a non-Unifi third party firewall.
 I have a microserver with single physical ethernet port. The parent interface is defined in the 192.168.200.0/24 network. It has a subinterface in the 192.168.220.0/24 network, and that is tagged on VLAN 220. My firewall has VLANs defined to restrict traffic, so I need the parent interface to be assigned to VLAN 200, but I can&#x27;t do that in the GUI on this server and I am trying not to make changes I may forget about via CLI.
 To manage this, the Unifi switch port has a native network on VLAN 200 assigned, and it is tagged for VLAN 220. That should leave the subinterface traffic unaltered and on VLAN 220, but will add VLAN 200 to the traffic on the parent interface only, correct?
 Put most simply, the switch will pass the physical/parent traffic to the firewall with VLAN 200, but it won&#x27;t modify the VLAN 220 tagged traffic from the subinterface because that traffic is already tagged. Correct?

 Could someone clarify how a company with ASN AS61317 is able to have netblocks from different RIRs (AFRINIC, ARIN, RIPE) on the same ASN?
 https://ipinfo.io/AS61317
 I ask because we&#x27;d like to accomplish something similar, but when we made a /22 subnet request to AFRINIC, we were told that we need separate ASNs and netblocks for AFRINIC and RIPE. Is it possible we misunderstood something?

                              <span>I work for a FTTH ISP and we are currently using a Cisco Nexus as our Edge. We are just taking default routes from our upstreams and we have two upstream providers (one 100G and one 40G). Traffic flows out one and back in over both. It works but we are looking to take full BGP tables from both and possible a third.
 We don&#x27;t really use any advanced router features, just the typical BGP, OSPF, a few static routes, and route maps. We are struggling to find a solution that offers the port speeds we use, can handle the BGP tables, and is cost effective.
 We are primarily a Cisco shop, mostly using secondhand gear. I realize our needs may push us to purchasing something new and that&#x27;s fine if it is the case.
 I stumbled across the Cisco NCS line and it looks like it might be up our alley. I was mostly interested in something like the 5504 or 5508 so we could grow it as we grow. The licensing has me tripped up a little bit though. I see them secondhand but I&#x27;m not so sure I can just buy one and it would work. I guess my main question is do these things require ongoing licensing and if so can I buy one used and purchase a license for it? Or do I need to go through a reseller and purchase one new.
 I&#x27;m also open to alternative solutions. Our current Edge router is using 2 100G ports and 4 40G ports. We have quite a few 10G ports on it as well. I&#x27;ve been looking at Juniper&#x27;s stuff and also considered looking at a whitebox solution such as Edge-Core. If we go with something else I prefer something as close to Cisco CLI as possible. Money is always an issue... we have it but I have to beg to get it. The worst part is going through all of the sales calls with each vendor just to get pricing information so I was hoping to get some solid ideas before I go through all of that.

                              <span>So i have a 2960 that i wanna set up for remote management but i dont want to use the management port. I created an interface called Vlan10 and assigned it an ip address. Since this is an interface, i cannot assign a port to it so what i wanna know is how can i connect to this interface remotely through any port on the switch?

                              <span>hello everyone
 already posted in r/fortinet
 we are a msp who offer an all inclusive cloud platform. within this we also deploy and support the on prem stuff from notebooks, switches, access points to firewalls. the endcustomer never touches the networking device (for this post important - the firewall) nor does config changes to it. at the moment we are transfereing from sophos utm to fortinet firewalls. as background info, with sophos we had 0 automation. every firewall was setup completely by hand (a lot of pain and very time consuming). we decided to manage our new fortis with fortianalyzer and fortimanager. all config changes are made on the manager and are pushed from there on to the device.
 we are expecting to migrato over 400 firewalls in the next years, as the sophos utm is going eol in 2026.
 now i wondered how other msps or multi tenant orgs deploy, patch and manage their forti firewalls. we looked into the fortimanager built in template features, but find them to be very limiting. we want to work with meta variables for all customer specific things and built all the other stuff as a standard. about 70% of our firewalls in the field do more or less the same config (some have a few special cases, more or fewer networks etc).
 is the best way to go cli scripts over fortimanager with variables or build an IaC etc…?
 i hope, that i have stated our situation well enough and hope to hear some interesting suggestions.

                              <span>I currently work for a company that uses Orion for our network monitoring platform. As a directive from about, we&#x27;re now looking at another SaaS type network monitoring solution. The solution seems to be far from mainstream (not going to mention by name, but HPE just bought them). There seems to be little information about anybody experience using it, but someone one of our VPs used to work with use it, and so it comes recommended and seems to be what we&#x27;re going to be using soon. 
 We are a very heavy Grafana shop. The vast majority of our application stack and business process flow monitored with Grafana. It&#x27;s seemingly the Go To solution for most of our monitoring....except for infrastructure (network/servers). 
 The primary driver to the proposed migration is cost. New vendor says they can save us tons, and we can eliminate Orion and PagerDuty. I&#x27;m questioning since we are so heavily using Grafana why we aren&#x27;t at least considering it for infrastructure, I suggested we at least explore a small POC to see how it would work for what we need. 
 Is there anyone out there using Grafana for their infrastructure monitoring? Horror or success stories? I&#x27;m starting to do a bit of research to see if this is a good use case, I see some articles on the topic, but not much from the aspect of &#x27;it&#x27;s what we use, here&#x27;s how it works for us&#x27;.

                              <span>Recently our remote support network team was assigned to setup redundant network connectivity for the organization. We have the static ip address and the gateway for the ISP&#x60;s modem that is on site. they say that it is not possible to setup redundant internet for our company as they dont have the ISP&#x60;s vlan details so they aren&#x27;t able setup the redundant connection. my solution was to create a static route to the second gateway and then add a route cost so that is higher than the other but i was told that it was not possible could someone please explain this to me.
 Edit For more information: Our current setup is 2 Cisco asa 5525X running in high availability They are two different ISPs They are setup to forward all traffic to the gateway if it doesnt match and a Nat rule

                              <span>Hello!
 We&#x27;re making a transition from a Cisco to an Aruba switch in our core. Just learned that NetFlow is proprietary to Cisco. The Aruba switch supports sFlow but we don&#x27;t want to just sample packets, we want to log every connection--source and destination, ports, time and number of packets / amount of data transferred. We don&#x27;t need to keep and store all the data that was transferred, just the connection/header info mentioned above.
 Does anyone know of a good (maybe open-source/free) platform that could provide similar analysis/logging as compared to NetFlow, but based only on gathering mirrored network traffic? We aren&#x27;t looking for something inline, just need to be able to go back in time and see what traffic flows are associated with a particular IP/host. For reference, we are currently exporting NetFlow data to SolarWinds which provides a webGUI for analysis of the exported data. I was wondering if an IPS like Snort might be able to do this.
 Thanks and best regards!

                              <span>Hi All,
 I have a rather strange issue.
 We have an internet service managed by Luminet. It&#x27;s a ISP managed HSRP via two of their CISCO routers. So two different circuits and they handle the IP failover.
 The two CISCOs are directly connected to each other.
 I have this connected into 2 x HP 2530 Switches on a dedicated VLAN for the WAN connection.
 So CISCO1 ETH0 goes to Switch 1 port 48 and CISCO2 ETH0 goes to Switch 2 port 48
 There is a fibre connection between the two HP switches just carrying the VLAN for the WAN connections. This is done via a HP LACP trunk and STP.
 Each of the HP Switches then has a connection to two internal fibre switches on an LACP Trunk carrying just the Management VLAN only. To allow access for managing the switches etc.
 We then have a port configured on each switch to uplink to our Watchguard HA Firewalls for WAN VLAN
 Basically the issue is when the two ISP WAN connections are connected to the required HP switch port 48 our end it creates a loop and kills the network. If I leave loop protect enabled it will block the port, then unblock, then block and cause issues.
 So essentially it&#x27;s blocking the link to one of the ISP routers ports that&#x27;s dedicated for the WAN uplink.
 I have tried putting the WAN ports on a HP Trunk as untagged and still it kills the network ports and then connectivity.
 ​
 I&#x27;m running out of ideas currently. Anyone seen this before?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 It maybe a stupid question, but I really want some advice on it
 ​
 Question: If I mirror traffic from a vlan, will all traffic cross different switchs with same vlan can be monitor?
 ​
 consider
  
there are multi switchs and have multi vlans
 truck port connect different switchs (not stacking)
 e.g. 192.168.65.1 send traffic to 192.168.66.1, if I mirror vlan66, can traffic be monitor?
 ​
  
- switch1 have 3 device connected and have different vlan (device1a,2a,3a) (vlan1 device a, vlan2 device a, vlan3 device c)
 - switch2 have 3 device connected and have different vlan (device1b,2b,3c)
 - switch3 have connect switch 1 and 2 with truck port (switch 3 contain the vlan gateway)
 if device 1a communicate with 2a, will mirror port contain related traffic on switch 2 or 3?

 How true is that? What percentage of revenue is typically cloud/subscription (recurring in nature)?

                              <span>I recently did a job interview, I was not successful. The feedback I got was that I gave single line answers to questions. But I find that unreasonable, like if the interviewer needed more information they would ask follow up questions I think.
 If you ask me, &quot;what color is the car&quot; and I tell you, &quot;it is blue&quot;, I think that is a fair answer. How would I know you&#x27;d expected me to say, &quot;the car is blue, it has tinted windows, it is a GM car, it has custom plates and I think it is a 1992 model&quot;. If I were to give an answer like that without specific questions asked I could go on forever describing that car, ultimately giving information that may be unnecessary.
 Am I the only one confused with this feedback or I could be overlooking something. Does it make sense to you folks?

 Presumably I&#x27;d need to access the PC&#x27;s hardware inside a script but I&#x27;m a bit unsure of even where to start in terms of what hardware I&#x27;d need to access specifically etc.
 Could anyone point me in the right direction?

                              <span>Hi, I have a couple of services hosted on a single machine running IIS and I can&#x27;t figure how to properly set up ssl certificates. 
 I currently use a self signed certificate since the network is isolated from the web, but almost all modern browsers trigger a warning when accessing the server. I found a solution that involves trusting the certificate but it is problematic since many different devices would access this server when connected to the network.
 Another solution was to create a private certificate authority but I want to minimize the changes I would need to do to the network. I haven&#x27;t found anything else so I&#x27;m asking here in case I missed something.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 Stuck in a sticky situation. Can we use MPO-16 for 100G-SR which uses MPO-12! My understanding is no as that uses MPO-12 and MPO-16 is for qsfp-dd (8x 50g channels). Also different connectors. 
 Thanks NS

                              <span>I just discovered this, and although I haven’t ordered any yet, it looks like these have a great potential. Imagine being able to bring gigabit ethernet to all of the rooms of a hotel or college dormitory or anywhere else where there is only coax cabling using nothing more than a switch and these modules.

                              <span>Hi!
 I have a quick question. We had a special solution made for an apartment building due to lack of ports, so we took 1 port (port 13) from our layer 3 switch, configured it with 11 vlans and then sent it to a layer 2 switch in the basement of that buildning and distributed the ports to each apartment, 11 in total. Worked fine but now that layer 2 switch died, and we have no good sized replacement for it unless we want to set up an entire layer 3 24 port switch which would be quite expensive. 
 The question is, can I configure 2 (6port) + WAN + Fibre CPEs. Where the first CPE takes Vlans 330,331,332,333,334 on the first 5 ports, then connect the second CPE to port 6, carry over the last 6 vlans, and put them on the 6 ports of the second CPE, in order to chain them, given correct configuration on the CPEs ofc. 
 Hopefully this was explained somewhat comprehensible.

                              <span>This happened a while ago.
 Prime company hired a new IT guy to support the test team.
 We are on separate teams, he supports one client I support the other.
 Before he was hired I spent months developing both environments. It wasn&#x27;t complicated. Vm environment with windows 10 vms that have commerical and government software. About 10 vms, some physical, all windows 10.
 I was psyched for his hire, he boasted that he was a VMware sme. He didn&#x27;t need an instruction on any of the hardware or software. He was a genius... That&#x27;s fine I consider myself an idiot so of he is smarter than me great it&#x27;s needed. 
 I tell them all I am taking my wife to lunch and taking the first true lunch since I started. I was working 12 hour shifts before he came. 
 I go to lunch and before our food arrives I get a phone call.
 Gov boss: GET BACK HERE ASAP WE HAVE AN ISSUE Me (calm and collected): okay what&#x27;s up? Gov: WE NEED TO DROP A FILE ON A VMS DESKTOP Me (annoyed): dude, new guy said he is the smartest vm guy of them all, can&#x27;t he do it? Gov: HE CANT, HE TRIED, I DONT THINK HE KNOWS ANYTHING!!!
 I am a sub to the prime so I got super nervous, I mean if I don&#x27;t rush back we could all be in trouble. 
 They are attempting to plug the hardrive with the file into a monitor that is not even attached to the system and can&#x27;t understand why it&#x27;s not popping up. I angerly grabbed the hd plugged it into the server attached it to the vm and asked what file they needed.... It was a text file with 1 line of code... They could have fucking hand jammed it... No apologies... That dude was a waste of a hire and this day was just the building block.
 Gov IT tho amiright?

                              <span>I know the remote domain option exists, but I tried to create an exception to allow forwarding to a specific domain and it didn&#x27;t work during testing. Maybe 365 was taking a bit for it to kick in? I then enabled external forwarding and used anti-spam policies and was able to create the exception I wanted.
 Im going to read docs now so I understand better, but figured Id ask.

 I try to be the best I can be every day, but rough ones just totally demoralize me.

                              <span>Anybody know what&#x27;s going on with Dallas county IT or their payroll vendor? Supposedly their Oracle systems keeps crashing. 
 According to the elected officials and county managers there&#x27;s no problem or they didn&#x27;t know about it. It&#x27;s a non-issue but some employees say they haven&#x27;t been correctly paid in months. 
 From DMN
 : Dallas County employees go to Labor Department following weeks of pay issues Some Dallas County employees have not been fully compensated for their work and time off in months after the county upgraded its computer payroll system. Now, these employees are lodging federal complaints. 
 Is this related to previous hacks or their own internal people causing outages.

We have decided to stop direct investment in the Next Unit of Compute (NUC) Business and pivot our strategy to enable our ecosystem partners to continue NUC innovation and growth. This decision will not impact the remainder of Intel’s Client Computing Group (CCG) or Network and Edge Computing (NEX) businesses. Furthermore, we are working with our partners and customers to ensure a smooth transition and fulfillment of all our current commitments – including ongoing support for NUC products currently in market.

                              <span>Something I learned recently, Cisco IOS routers and switches can act as an mDNS (Bonjour in Apple lingo) gateway. If you&#x27;ve ever had to shuffle mDNS traffic (discovery of printers, chromecast, airplay devices, ...) between VLANs, this is for you. The go to solution on the internet is installing Avahi on a linux VM somewhere and turn on &quot;enable-reflector&quot; to make it rebroadcast mDNS traffic received on one interface to other interfaces. But it&#x27;s a kludge, you need a linux VM to start with and then for every VLAN you need an interface inside that VM...
 But Cisco routers &amp; switches can do this on their own, here&#x27;s a simple configuration with 3 VLANs:
 ! service-list mdns-sd PERMIT-ALL permit 10 match message-type any ! service-routing mdns-sd ! interface Vlan3 ip address 10.1.3.1 255.255.255…</span>

                              <span>I haven’t really looked at previous posts so I’m not sure if it’s been done but I’m curious what sysadmins are making. I know this varies on region, experience, etc. so maybe include your title, state/country, years of experience and anything else you might want to include.
 The reason I ask is because I’m anticipating a discussion this year on moving into a salaried position and I sort of want to gauge what others are making.
 As it stands right now I made $70k last year (lots of OT, base salary is really ~$58k), I’ve been in the field for 2.5 years and I’m based in Michigan.

                              <span>I work at a small company where the owner was previously the entire IT team. Our HR/Accounting people are concerned about giving me Domain Admin rights because I would then technically have access to all the secure employee private information and company financials and they aren’t sure how to handle the legality.
 How do other companies handle this? Do Admins have to sign NDAs or something? I worked at my previous job for 10+ years and don’t remember what I may have signed when I started.
 EDIT: everyone had their related and justified comments but no one has really answered the question. What does your company do? Did HR have an NDA for you to sign? The people in HR in my company have never encountered this before and are unsure how to handle it. It’s not that they are trying to prevent me from accessing it, they just don’t know how other companies do it.
 EDIT2: I work in the US.

                              <span>The other week our rep told us that standalone MIM licenses are no longer available for purchase - but some parts of MIM might be able to be bought as it’s included in Azure P1/2. Maybe. They sounded very exasperated and said they couldn’t really find a straight answer anywhere.
 After a couple of days, neither can I.
 MIM EoL is 2029’ish so yeah that makes sense. Cloud is the future anyway. Yada yada.
 What the hell do you do when you’re building an air gapped environment? I’m not against using something like Entrust Identity Enterprise but prefer to stay as native as possible. 
 Does it make sense taking out new Azure P subscriptions just for MIM? How would that even work for an environment with no outside connection other than a single bastion host? Would you still be buying the “full” MIM16 product or would it be a gimped package?
 What would your approach be for a “ground up” engagement like this?

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month&#x27;s updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft&#x27;s Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft&#x27;s updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn&#x27;t work.
 Test, test, and test!

 ​
 I have a question for fellow EU admins. Can you setup automatic forwarding from one personal email address to another. This is blank rule where all emails are forwarded. Let&#x27;s assume that both parties have agreed to this.
 ​
 Bonus question: If we assume that we can, what happens after one of the parties leaves the company, can the forwarding rule be kept ?
 ​
 I know this is question for lawyer more than sysadmins, but I was wondering if anyone had experience with such requests.

                              <span>Our company acquired a Chinese company a while back, and I recently stumbled across some incorrect conditional forwarders for their domain. For reference, we have:
  
Olddomain.com - points to three correct forwarders
 Olddomaintest.com - points to three correct forwarders
 Newdomain.cn - points to four incorrect forwarders
  
Of those four forwarders, two point to DCs that were decommissioned over a year ago, and the other two are IP addresses that neither I nor the lead engineer have any clue about, as they&#x27;re not even on a Windows subnet.
 I&#x27;ve tried deleting them and replacing them with the correct forwarders, but am consistently running into an error message &quot;The data on the conditional forwarder failed to set. Access was denied.&quot;
 This is what I&#x27;ve tried so far:
  
Domain admin account, through DNS
 Added the DA account to DNSAdmins
 Tried dsacls &quot;\\servername\CN&#x3D;MicrosoftDNS, CN&#x3D;System, DC&#x3D;domain, dc&#x3D;com&quot; /G DNSADMINS:GA /I:T, to confirm the DNSAdmins group had full access
 Verified that Domain Admins have full control to DNS via DNS
 Verified that Domain Admins have full control to DNS via ADSI Edit
 Tried adding myself to Enterprise Admins
 Looked in Event Log (can&#x27;t find anything at all)
  
​
 Does anyone have any suggestions?

 I&#x27;m based in the UK and I&#x27;ve recently taken on my first IT manager role and there are a number of projects that we&#x27;re looking to get underway including a CCTV and video conferencing project. 
 As far as I understand I need to obtain three seperate quotes to ensure they&#x27;re competitive but I&#x27;ve been asked to present a proposal. 
 Could anyone offer any advice on how to present my proposal once I&#x27;ve obtained the nessecary quotes?

 Currently testing out the new LAPS with Azure AD Joined devices and I find myself unable to keep the password for longer than the default/max 24h after the first use. Does anyone know how to prevent this Post Authentication Action?
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/laps/laps-management-policy-settings#postauthenticationactions
 With legacy LAPS we were able to provide the password for longer periods of time to some software engineers. The 24h limit is really not practical in our case. :/

I&#x27;m doing research and trying to schedule a demo, but wanted to see if anybody here uses/has used TOPdesk and what your experience was. Thanks in advance for any insight you&#x27;re able to give!

                              <span>I recently migrated an RDP server from an old ESXi to Hyper-V.
 Since then AD users cannot RDP using the hostname. I have taken the following troubleshooting steps.
  
confirmed DNS resolutions to and from RDP, client and AD servers.
 I can RDP to hostname using non-ad accounts.
 I can RDP to IP using AD accounts.
  
The Domain controllers are 2008 and 2022.
 ​
 Edit: I was too fast IT IS DNS.
 The reverse lookup record was missing, not sure why I migration would suddenly break it.
 Thanks all

I’m used to using the AD PowerShell module but what’s the difference between these methods? Is ADSI simply an older method like using a batch file over PowerShell that may be a little clunky but gets the job done?

                              <span>Printer: Toshiba e-STUDIO338CS
 When a scan is attempted, the scan log is printed; email server response: 530-5.7.0 Authentication Required. We have a printer on which smtp.gmail.com works and it was set up the same way on this one. I have read every possible solution to the problem and none of it worked. The mail we are using is set to access less secure applications but generating the app password did not help. The problem seems to be that the server can&#x27;t recognize the device for some reason.
 So I tried using smtp2go where the only way it works is that the user has to manually type in the smtp server authentication credentials each time they scan, because there is no way to enter them in the printer? Is there any way to solve this so that it is not necessary to enter those details every time I print? 
 Is this a problem of the model or me? Is there a more advanced approach to this problem that could help?
 ​
 Politely asking for help because I&#x27;ve spent a lot of time on this.

                              <span>Hi All, 
 I have a situation which I&#x27;m trying to get my head around. 
 We have a company which traded under one name, then started to trade under another. We went all in with AAD Joining these devices as per the below, but now we need to swap them. 
 User details:
  
Primary UPN: [name@oldcompany.co.uk](mailto:name@oldcompany.co.uk)
 Licences: Microsoft 365 Business Premium, Teams Business Voice
 Laptop: Signs in with [name@oldcompany.co.uk](mailto:name@oldcompany.co.uk) - AAD Joined
 Shared Mailbox: [name@company.co.uk](mailto:name@company.co.uk) (using some magic around the SMTP address so that it matches the primary (so john@ is both from a receiving perspective)
  
They now want to shift everything so that newcompany.co.uk is the UPN, with the old company becoming their shared mailbox. 
 I would like to achieve this with the most minimal amount of disruption but have no idea where to start without breaking things. 
 They use SPO and OD also, so this will be a consideration. 
 Thanks,

After some research i tried to copy a file (2MB) from joined domain computer to the non joined domain backup server and it took 3 minutes to copy!! That was a shock
 So I’m wondering if the domain situation is the issue and the backup server should be joined domain to get full speed?
 I want it off domain in case of ransomware or any virus attack? Can you help me?

                              <span>Hey guys, so we are primarily windows shop. I was a linux sysadmin turned dev, we asked for docker and now I&#x27;m working with our IT team to make sure it appropriately setup. Most of our docker concerns are fixed but not WSL or HyperV. Just want to set it up in way that in compliant with everyone.
 So the very first question WSL vs HyperV,
 As far I know WSL2 uses HyperV now to run its VM. So kind of a moot question but maybe I&#x27;m missing something.
 Second is WSL2 permissions,
 As far I know WSL VM inherits windows permissions and user, with enhanced container isolation we fix our other issues. Network is bridge so same rules should apply.
 Anything else Im missing? I don&#x27;t us to be a pain for the actual sysadmin. We will responsible for maintaining our container and VMs.

 ​
 I am working for a ~100 users business and I&#x27;m the sole IT there. 
 We currently have a timesheet software that is running on PostGRE SQL (not web-based) that is causing some issue that I can&#x27;t understand.
 Since I have taken over about one year and a half, I started cleaning up the network, segregating servers and clients into different subnet. Previously most servers and even some critical management appliances (such as the vCenter, ESXi Management interface, etc) were on the same VLAN and subnet as the clients.
 I have now created a few more subnets with printers, clients, servers, etc, and moving everything out of the old subnet which was on 192.168.0.0/24.
 The timesheet software&#x27;s server is still on that subnet, as well as most clients, since I am moving the clients only w…</span>

I have the impression that they just open tickets, but after meetings, there are no solutions, and they just close them. It seems like they have a system of scheduling meetings, having a chat, and quickly closing the ticket. Every ticket means money, but they are not solving issues. Pointless.

 Whole point is to have 1 web access point for both KVMs.

 What kind of background trace/logging do you put in place to try to get some useful info on what the process is that&#x27;s causing it when you get this situation please?

 They press the OneDrive icon and are prompted for email. When entering their email, the program just flashes in the taskbar and then seems to restart. We are never prompted for the password, and the sign-in doesn&#x27;t work.
 This is running on an AVD, and we have tried disabling MFA, resetting Internet Explorer settings, disabling all GPOs, disabling Windows Firewall, updating OneDrive, and reinstalling OneDrive.
 This issue comes and goes for all users on the machines. Has anyone experienced anything like this before?

 I&#x27;ve tried contacting Level3 but without luck.
 So if you were using 4.2.2.4 for verifying your uptime or like in my case as a failover criteria to switch to the backup wan, you might need to make some adjustments.

                              <span>I have a program that&#x27;s written in python and its sending its logs to the local rsyslog. And my local rsyslog is configured to connect in a tcp fashion to a remote rsyslog. Now the thing is that I want to know when my local rsyslog is connected to the external rsyslog so that I can show it in my python program. I know that rsyslog has this property for imtcp called &#x27;NotifyOnConnectionOpen&#x27; but this will log its connection on the remote rsyslog. And I don&#x27;t have access to the logs on the remote rsyslog. Is there a way to get it on my side? 
 I know that I can find if it&#x27;s connected or not with ss -tunp but that seems like a lot of trouble to go through just to automate the process of finding out if the tcp connection is up. And it&#x27;s very hard to scale up when I have multiple remote rsyslogs.
 I don&#x27;t know if this is the correct place to ask this question but hey, a shot in the dark.

                              <span>So our the Problem is as it follows:
 Our Cert on our vSphere server (win 2016) run out the other day. We cant login with our domain users because we always get the error &quot;please input your crendetials&quot; even after inputing them.
 So i tryed changing the cert which the server already got from the ca and ran into a even bigger problem.
 With the the &quot;C:\Program Files\VMware\vCenter Server\vmcad\certificate-manager&quot; manager. Not a big problem i thought as i run the setup i came across another BIG problem. After selecting 1 for changing the cert the setup asks you to put into your pw for &quot;administrator@vsphere.local&quot; and yea we lost that somehow.
 Okay next step trying to reset the &quot;administrator@vsphere.local&quot; user acc. I used the &quot;vdcadmintool&quot; tool tot reset the pw. Which worked BUT when i try to log into the acc via the webinterface i always get &quot;wrong username or pw&quot; so as it now stands i cant login with my user due to the cert problem and when i try to change the cert i cant login into the local admin.
 Have any of you ever experienced such problem? Which pisses me of the most is that resetting the &quot;administrator@vsphere.local&quot; account gives me a pw but that just doesnt work.
 Oh we are using vSphere 6.7
 So googeling a few yours brought me nothing so now my hope is with you guys.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve owned this PC for quite some time now and have recently discovered that certain settings are locked by my &quot;organization.&quot; It&#x27;s strange because this computer is strictly for personal use and I&#x27;ve never used it for anything outside of school. It has always been situated in my home. I&#x27;m not very familiar with registry editors or policy updates, but I&#x27;m hoping to be able to access the Microsoft Store, which is currently blocked. Do you have any suggestions?

                              <span>Hello fellow Redditors,
 I find myself at a crossroads in my career and would greatly appreciate your opinions and advice. 
 Currently, I have been working as a Big Data SysAdmin for the same company in Europe for 6 years. While I enjoy what I do, I am beginning to question whether I should continue with my current job (Senior Tech Lead - Infrastruture - Delivery) or explore new opportunities. Here are some factors that are weighing on my mind:
 Job Security: I currently have a permanent contract, which provides some level of wage security. This is particularly important to me as I have a 1-year-old child and a house to support.
  
Skill Set: Although I have a solid understanding of various open-source applications and systems, I don&#x27;t consider myself an expert in any specific area. Howeve…</span>

                              <span>I have been tasked with upgrading our 2012r2 servers to 2019 and they are 2014 SQL servers as well. 
 I have read some google articles on the upgrade. But most are either just in the server OS or SQL. Not them together. I know SQL has to be upgraded too. All servers are VM’s and I am obviously going to take snapshots. 
 I have never upgraded a SQL server and I am a bit nervous and I am definitely not a DBA. 
 I according to what I read it sounds like I upgrade the server OS first (2012r2 straight to 2019) and then the SQL (2017?)? Is this the proper path? What should I look out for? Any gotcha’s? 
 It sounds relatively simple and it’s either going to work or it’s not and I have to revert and do a migration which I REALLY don’t want to do. 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>One of our clients has a fully licensed 365 account that they plan on using with a site chatbot, and the problem is that MFA is keeping the account from working properly on the side of the chatbot provider. 
 In the past we&#x27;d have made an App Pass and it&#x27;d all work swimmingly but that&#x27;s no longer an option. So my next idea was turn off MFA on the account and just make a conditional access policy to keep it secure, but no dice, even when I disable MFA on the account it still prompts for it both on that account and any other account I disable it for/bran new test account so I&#x27;m getting the impression that:
 A. You cannot disable MFA per user any more
 B. There&#x27;s a policy enforcing this from outside 365 as currently no conditional access policy is enforcing this on everyone
 I know that they have manage engine and supposedly this may also be enforcing it somehow, never touched ME before, and frustratingly the person at the client who set it up left with no documentation so now I&#x27;m trying to work it out with 1 IT guy they have left.
 Literally anything to point me in the right direction would be helpful

                              <span>to get access to the legacy administration console, I&#x27;ve found that I can simply add a lower-case &quot;L&quot; after the # in the URL, so for me:
 https://login-au.mimecast.com/administration/app/#**/l**/administration-dashboard 
 you may need to change the login-au to something else relevant to your region.
 works a treat.

 I came across a post that suggested modifying a registry value to achieve this, but unfortunately, it didn&#x27;t work for me. How can I tell Windows to overwrite a system file on the next reboot?
 I am solely focused on finding a solution within the current parameters and do not wish to explore alternative methods at the moment.

                              <span>I spent the better half of the evening setting up a proof of concept using python and langchain to make an AI junior sysadmin. Call me lazy, but I am not a very deep sysadmin. I use linux on my main, but sometimes find myself having to do things like setting up a node stack on an AWS EC2 instance, with a specific flavor of linux. I love command line, but I&#x27;ve always dreamed of not having to spend half my time looking up the commands to run for the same thing on different systems.
 This brings me to my script. I have already found a ton of use cases and usefulness out of it and it has only been an evening! I am sharing here the github as I have made it open source, and a friend of mine has also made a windows port of the script called wombat.
 Please let me know what you guys think as sysadmins. I know that using AI is basically cheating, but for someone who&#x27;s not really so much sysadmin it is good. I also made it so that it saves the generated scripts in the scripts folder so it is easy to use as a reference/cheat sheet for commands in any OS/shell.

                              <span>Applied for a first line IT Support role and while I was in my notice period, my so-called new manager got fired. Started my first day with the news that my teammate was fired as well. Handover was a joke (not his fault). So here I am, 8 months in and the only one managing IT. Nobody else. I&#x27;m doing on/offboardings, deploying devices, managing AAD/M365, negotiating contracts &amp; licenses, trying to keep everything secure for 200 users which are scattered across multiple offices in the EU and even a manufacturing plant. And no, I&#x27;m not traveling (yet). There&#x27;s shadow IT everywhere and I&#x27;m starting to feel... overwhelmed.
 I have a new manager which luckily supports me but there&#x27;s no way I&#x27;m going to get help or a second FTE due to budget. The way I see it, I&#x27;m the IT manager/sysadmin without the title/pay and skills. I don&#x27;t think I can hold out much longer or am I being dramatic? I can&#x27;t imagine there are many companies working like this.

 Is there a way to get these two UPS&#x27;s back up and running again?

                              <span>Hello all!
 I have been tasked with putting together a package for an AV company that puts on events. They want to do an ad-hoc network that will support up to 300 wireless clients at a time. The use case is simply to provide public wifi to check emails, browse, social media, etc. The AP/switching/routing portion is pretty easily accomplished. We plan on implementing client isolation, of course, and bandwidth limiting each client to about 2 Mbps. So total throughput really would only need to be 600Mbps if all devices were running full tilt.
 They want to use cellular to connect to WAN, and so my first thought was Cradlepoint. Specifically looking at this one https://cradlepoint.com/product/endpoints/w1850-series/ . The data sheet states that it can do 2 Gbps passthrough... so im assuming this is factoring in download AND upload. But for anyone that actually uses these things.... are you getting ANYWHERE near that speed? I understand that not all devices are created equal... but I have a 5g modem for traveling and it gets around 20Mbps... my cell phone gets around 2.
 This would be in the seattle metro area so coverage from all carriers is excellent in most places. What are your real life experiences with speeds on these things?

                              <span>I&#x27;m horrendously pissed at DYMO for killing off my beloved XTL 300 and its supplies. I use it religiously in our datacenters the past 5 years for hundreds of HPC chassis labeling, power cable and fiber optic labling, especially 1/4&#x27;&#x27; or 6mm sizes and that it automatically adjusts text link depending on length and the color LCD made it easy to see in a variety of lightining conditions
 Now i&#x27;m having to start all over and I&#x27;m really not wanting to support DYMO crap business practices with their DRM labels, so should I get a Brady or a Brother handheld that can do my dymo did? Budget isn&#x27;t of a concern thankfully after talking to my director of DevOps

                              <span>Am I the only one who has issues resolving PTR records of Amazon AWS IP space at the moment?
 When requesting for 54.240.62.30 (IP belonging to Amazon SES), my Bind recursor responds with SERVFAIL and logs the lines at the end of the post. Otherwise the resolver is working fine, that&#x27;s why I assume it&#x27;s more a thing with Amazon - but resolvers like Cloudflare or Google DNS are resolving fine. So I&#x27;m a bit irritated if it&#x27;s a problem with my Bind or with Amazon. Has anyone else seen problems like this?
 My Bind is running in Germany, near Düsseldorf (&quot;DUS&quot;).

                              <span>Have a good amount of experience in Networking by now. I resigned from my last position due to an awful boss. 
 Having a little more trouble than usual finding another gig. Usually I get hit up pretty quick on Linkedin and chose a company to interview with and I&#x27;m off and running.

                              <span>Until recently, I could reliably capture CDP packets using pktmon. Suddenly it stopped working for some unknown reason. Maybe the admins changed something. I&#x27;ve since turned to netsh, however I haven&#x27;t gotten this one to work just yet.
 I&#x27;m running these commands from a computer that gets its network through a Cisco VoIP phone (7831).
 ​
 For pktmon:
 pktmon filter add -m 01-00-0C-CC-CC-CC
 pktmon start -c --comp  --pkt-size 0 -f C:\capture.etl
 pktmon counters --live
 Again, this was working. I was able to use this, along with some parsing in powershell, to get the phone number, MAC address, and IP address of the phone. But as I said, it no longer does.
 ​
 For netsh:
 netsh trace start capture&#x3D;yes Ethernet.DestinationAddress&#x3D;01-00-0C-CC-CC-CC tracefile&#x3D;C:\trace.etl maxsize&#x3D;1 report&#x3D;disabled
 From what I&#x27;ve gathered, it can take up to 2 minutes to see the packet, but I&#x27;ve run both for much longer with nothing to show. What am I missing?

Budget is always a factor so I prefer a non subscription cloud or software managed access point. 5000 Square ft coverage, MU MIMO, WiFi 6 and POE+ are important features. What do you guys recommend?

                              <span>I joined a company this month that instead of using Trunk ports, they use Access ports between switches and the firewall with with VLAN 1 Native, and VLAN 1-4094 tagged as Allowed. Does this have any performance issues or is this just another way to create a trunk port? The site only uses VLAN 10, 20 and 30 at sites.

                              <span>Hey all.
 I can&#x27;t seem to find info on this. I came across what I assume may be a legacy jinja statement
 {% raise(&quot;More than &quot; + agg_limit | string + .......bunch more text string 
 This is all embedded within an if conditional. I ASSUME it&#x27;s to raise an exception but I can&#x27;t seem to find anything online for it, or at least my key searches are producing nothing.
 Also, what does the PIPE do within a jinja2 conditional?
 Thanks everyone

                              <span>Hey y&#x27;all. New to the networking world, dropped my previous career of logistics and recently got hired onto a network engineer position. Currently I travel about 9 months out of the year, with a new site each week/2 weeks. Nothing too extreme, mostly dealing with Fortinet transitions from Cisco hardware, not too many new installs, mostly small refreshes. I currently carry a Swiss Gear bag, and it holds my two laptops, the chargers, and my Nintendo Switch case (necessity, ofcourse). In my duffel I carry an Ekahau Sidekick 2, 2 tablets, and about 4 patch cables, a coupler with each (for both laptops), andd a plethora of adapters and different console/serial cables. I have a sense that I&#x27;m too cluttered or may not be carrying as efficiently, if anyone has any recommendations for the full time travel gig bag, or what works best for them, I&#x27;d love to hear.
 TLDR: Need backpack recs for new network engineer, feel as if carrying too much for these trips.

 I&#x27;m looking for a shippable hard case to ship Meraki or equivalent gear (right how a MS120 switch, 3 Meraki APs, and a MX68). Something with a carry handle and wheels is preferred that we can deploy for &#x27;flash sale&#x27; or &#x27;store within a store&#x27;. 
 Also, I wonder if there is something similar that we could rackmount larger gear.

                              <span>So I have a project that requires me to run some fiber to a remote site but then I am out of SFP and can&#x27;t fit more in the space I&#x27;m at, but I need to go from the remote site to an other spot to power a WiFi AP.
 The AP can only do 2.5 but hooked to a 1gbit link. I&#x27;ve done 105M runs and was able to do 5Gbit, 10gb was unstable, although I didn&#x27;t ground the connectors for that run.. 
 Curious on your thoughts, or should I try a different approach? I have 120 but very very little space at the destination (light posts with mini enclosures). 
 Thanks!
 Edit: Media converter it is. It is what it is. I found some nice compact weatherproof converters that should do the trick. Power it from a small 48VDC PSU. Expensive but fits the enclosure.
 Thank you all for your help. Pretty cut and dry.

                              <span>Hi everyone. I work in IT at a small local school district, and a few weeks ago, our ISP upgraded us from 1Gbps to 10. Our small Meraki network consists of three schools pretty close together, one more Elementary school the next town over, and one more Elementary even further away. The network originates in the Middle School and runs to all the others before getting routed back through the middle school. I want to make sure each schools&#x27; network is getting the max amount of bandwidth. I am seeing on our main MX switch that both the nearby elementary school and the high school only have one fiber cable going to each, it just looks like one strand and the other socket next to it is empty. Should I be looking to get another fiber strand going to each? And beyond that, should I look into upgrading the fiber cables that go between all the MS225 switches in our schools? Thanks for any insight.

                              <span>Hello! I know, I know... Unifi, bleh... But still, does anyone know how Unifi&#x27;s IP conflict detection works under the hood?
 ​
 The scenarios are that Unifi switches and access points are being used. In no case is a Unifi gateway being used and so some other DHCP server is being used, either firewall of a different vendor or Windows Server.
 ​
 The reason I ask is because, while the feature of IP conflict detection is certainly useful and certainly sometimes correct, it also seems to be sometimes erroneous. 
 ​
 For example, sometimes there will be an alert for an IP conflict, and thorough checking is done and through manual checking there does not appear to be an actual conflict. 
 ​
 In another example, sometimes it will alert that there is an IP conflict on X subnet, but not specify which IP it detected in conflict. In what scenario would a Unifi switch or AP be able to detect &quot;a&quot; conflict but not a specific IP that is in conflict? 
 ​
 Anyway, I could guess what mechanisms and logic are being used for IP conflict detection, but it would be helpful to know actual fact as to what&#x27;s triggering the alerts, to help identify if it is an erroneous detection or to help track down the offending device(s). In many cases the networks are far away and being managed remotely, so just going onsite and tracking things down physically is not always an option.
 ​
 I&#x27;ve searched online but was not able to find much of any information at all about the internal workings of this feature. If anyone knows some details about it, I&#x27;d be grateful.

                              <span>Hello Team,
 I am not a networking expert and am a bit out of my element. So, I&#x27;m looking for a bit of high-level guidance and appreciate your time. 
 We have a networking partner we&#x27;ve been working with to upgrade our infrastructure to Meraki appliances. We have MX68CWs (spokes) at each branch and an MX105 (hub) at our HQ with site-to-site VPN setup. 
 Our networking partner is telling us that Cisco AnyConnect cannot be used with these appliances and that we must use native VPN clients built into Windows and other supported operating systems. Yet, this documentation states that all these models are supported for use with AnyConnect. Note that we also use Duo Security and SAML for MFA-protected SSO logon to AnyConnect. 
 Is our networking partner correct?
 EDIT: Thanks so much to everyone for your detailed responses. I appreciate the help. I will now push back on my networking partner.

                              <span>Hi Experts,
 I want to setup a linux/ubuntu IPv4 firewall in for UDP connections to port :7777 with the following rules:
  
By default block all connections to UDP Port :7777.
 Allow only whitelisted IPs connections to UDP Port :7777.
 If an IP has made a connection trigger to port :8888 then add it to the whitelist for X time (2 days).
  
How can I archive this? 
 Can this be all done using IPTables, UFW or does it requires some other applications?

In June 2023, a Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agency identified suspicious activity in their Microsoft 365 (M365) cloud environment. The agency reported the activity to Microsoft and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and Microsoft determined that advanced persistent threat (APT) actors accessed and exfiltrated unclassified Exchange Online Outlook data.
CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to provide guidance to critical infrastructure organizations on enhancing monitoring of Microsoft Exchange Online environments. Organizations can enhance their cyber posture and position themselves to detect similar malicious activity by implementing logging recommendations in this advisory. Organiz…</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m Studying for the CCNP-Service Provider and I&#x27;m trying out H-vpls / e-tree n-pe redundancy design. I&#x27;m following along with Cisco docs but I&#x27;m stuck. I&#x27;ve been troubleshooting for the whole day with no success.
 Here&#x27;s where I am.
 My bridge-domains have a Mac stored from their cpe but I can&#x27;t see them being forwarded to their xconnect peers the NPEs. The x-connect is showing up up and the NPEs vfi are showing up as well. It seems all vfis and x-connects peers are up but I&#x27;m not seeing the upes exchanging their mac&#x27;s or mac&#x27;s in the bridge-domain of the NPEs. I&#x27;ve tried pinging end to end to watch / capture icmp debugs and wireshark analyze the traffic but once the traffic from the CPE enters the UPE I don&#x27;t see any icmp traffic. I&#x27;ve also tried debugging the ingress and egress node with no luck with the various combinations.
 At this point I have no clue what to try next or if the virtual nodes in my cml lab (ios17.03) support H-vpls redundancy. I know that virtual images may have some difficulty imitating l2 traffic. Also the documentation for this topic is sparse so even knowing what to troubleshoot or debug is a nightmare.
 I&#x27;m open to suggestions and even recommendations for books about l2vpn Cisco support.
 Here&#x27;s the doc I am trying to following along with (https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/asr920/configuration/guide/mpls/17-1-1/b-mp-l2-vpns-xe-17-1-asr920/m_mp-hvpls-npe-red-mpls-access_asr920.html)

 Unfortunately, I have the problem that only one BGP peer IP can be configured per redundant VPN tunnel on the Azure side. Does anyone have a solution/configuration guide

 Would anyone be able to tell me why this is? What is the reasoning behind it?
 Thank you!

                              <span>I&#x27;m relatively new to IT (&lt;2 years), but in that time I&#x27;ve leaned heavily into network automation, becoming my team&#x27;s de-facto automation &quot;engineer&quot;. Up until recently most of my work has been in Python with Nornir, and I&#x27;ve really enjoyed doing that, but recently my team wanted me to start automating against some network appliances (FMC, DNAC, SW). This is where the trouble first started.
 The first issue occurred when I automated a per-interface change in the FMC, something that when configured manually was completely innocuous, and appeared to be the same when automating, but ultimately ended up breaking NAT across the company. Luckily we have very limited use of NAT, but it still caused some minor blips before I was able to remediate. Ultimately it was just seen as a near-miss and a on…</span>

                              <span>My impression that a lot of network tools (automation, monitoring, etc.) runs atop CentOS Linux, but given RedHat&#x27;s recent moves (killing CentOS back in 2021, and now going after the Rocky/Alma) I&#x27;m wondering if that&#x27;s going to change. 
 I&#x27;m wondering what this network community thinks of this, as well as what distros are you using? 
  
What distro do you use for your network automation and/or NMS systems (or do you use something other than Linux)
 Do you (network department) have control over the OS used? Or is it prescribed to you by overall management? 
 Are you aware of the RedHat controversy? 
 If you are, and are affected, what are your plans?

                              <span>I was looking at a redesign of the network where I work. I work in the Energy sector and we have multiple methods of communication across a large regional area of states in the USA. We currently have a mixture of BGP and OSPF routing protocols with route redist at several places in the network. The more the network grows and the more &quot;routing rules&quot; we put in place, the more I think that just going BGP full stack all through the network is a good idea. The issue I have with going forward is that not EVERYBODY on the network staff is fully proficient in BGP routing, and its easy to just slap OSPF on interfaces for them. My issue is that if prefix lists for redistribution are not followed and updated properly, then it still causes issues routing from BGP to OSPF or vice versa anyway. We might as well just BGP it all and attach route preferences using BGP attributes such as weight, path prepending and local preference. 
 ​
 I also think I could make things a bit easier to roll traffic using community values that would be propagated through the entire BGP environment, and use some of those values for path selections and ease of rolling traffic when I get it all scripted for those who may not be as proficient with BGP. My thought was that it would be easier for those folks just to maybe change a community value in one edge router to roll internet traffic, and have all other routers in the environment follow the rules attached to that community value. Hopefully that makes sense. I don&#x27;t want to over complicate things, but honestly, things are getting more complicated just in the redistribution of routes that are happening today anyhow. It just keeps getting worse the more we grow.

 Thanks,

                              <span>Please can you help me? Please. I&#x27;ve gone to delete an interface on Checkpoint Smart Console and I have stupidly deleted the wrong one from both units in the ClusterXL pair. Clustering was disabled at the time. I re-added it, re-started clustering, which did start again on the standby unit, but now the unit that was active has gone down, and the formerly standby unit is now Active, and I cannot restart clustering on the former active unit. When I do try it gives me this message: 
 [Expert@firewallb:0]# clusterXL_admin up
 This command does not survive reboot. To make the change permanent, run either the &#x27;set cluster member admin {down|up} permanent&#x27; command in Gaia Clish, or the &#x27;clusterXL_admin {down|up} -p&#x27; command in Expert mode

 Any idea how to fix this? I am now really worried about the state of the firewall pair.

                              <span>Hello All,
 I am currently working on hosting TFTP to provide config files to a phone system. I am currently planning to use solar winds TFTP as the server for the requests from the phone. I&#x27;m currently in the testing phase and when I run the command &quot;tftp -i XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX get 1.txt&quot; I get a fairly diverse set of messages from my multiple sources. I&#x27;ll share them bellow
 From the terminal I am putting the request into I get the following message: &quot;Connect request failed&quot;
 From the Solarwinds TFTP interface I get &quot;Dropped because the peer didn&#x27;t respond.&quot;
 From Wireshark I get a few alternating messages: &#x27;Data packet, block 1 (last)&#x27;,&#x27; read request: File 1.txt, transfer type: Octet&#x27;, &#x27;error code, code: Not defined, Message: Connection timeout&#x27;, and &#x27;Error Code, code: Unknown Transfer ID, message: Connection isn&#x27;t established.&#x27; 
 I&#x27;ve turned off windows firewall so nothing should be stopping anything from communicating to the server. I&#x27;ve tried downloaded from 2 different sources, with the exact same issue. Both are on the same subnet, with one being from a computer in a different building and the other being from a computer plugged into the same switch. 
 I will answer any further questions in the comments bellow. Thank you for your help!

I statically assign an IP address, burn it, reset it, even power cycle it, and no problem. I can accessthe GUI via my assigned address. But a day or two later I go to access the GUI and get a time out error from the browser. I can&#x27;t even ping it anymore. But when I console in to it, it says it&#x27;s still has the IP I assigned to it. DHCP is disabled. It is running the latest and greatest SW. This has happened in four different locations/ network (3 production and 1 lab). Even when directly connected with my PC. So, I reset it back to defaults and access the GUI via its default IP address and assign an IP address just for it to happen again. What am I doing wrong?

                              <span>Hello,
 I encountered a problem with VOIP network that I&#x27;m unable to track down and solve. The problem I have seems kinda weird and I don&#x27;t really know what else to try.
 Firstly, the equipment:
 - Router MikroTik RB201 rb2011uias-2hnd-in (Managed by ISP)
 - Switch D-Link DGS 1210 (4x)
 - Phones Grandstream GXP1615 (30x)
 - PBX MIZU running on up to date hardware (16 GB RAM, 8 core CPU)
 Config of network (done by provider):
 - Two VLANS
 - 1 is for PC traffic [tagged]
 - 9 is for VOIP [untagged]
 - Phones are able to passthrough the traffic from PC
 What works:
 - Calling outside from any VOIP phone
 - Calling inside between any VOIP phone (except one, dunno why, every phone and port is configured the same)
 - Transferring calls inside the network
 - According to VOIP provider the call is…</span>

 Can I find a Cisco documentation that says that it is/isn&#x27;t compatible?
 I have tried googling but couldn&#x27;t find anything.
 Thanks in advance.

 I have to make an AP join a WLC on a different subnet. I can SSH into the core and access switch that the AP is connected to but I don&#x27;t know whether I can reach a DHCP/DNS server in that subnet. What is the easiest way to go about this?

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;ve a new home and the current network installation is almost in-existent. What it currently has is just an ONT in an electrical box on the main hallway.
 Picture of the electrical box:
 ​
 electrical box
 I need to move the ONT to the garage because my rackstation / firewall / switches are there. Good news is that the main electrical box has some corrugated tubes connected to different rooms, including the garage. But these corrugated tubes are narrow and have some complicated corners (I&#x27;ve already checked with fishing cable). I need 10gbe all arround and I&#x27;m afraid that passing cat6a or cat7 could be a problem, so I am also considering changing ethernet cables to fiber.
 ​
 This rough diagram shows the current config and my initial proposal:
 First propossal
 The required equipment is clear to me, but if I move all to fiber I have no equipment to finish the connections and I do not know if it could be a good idea. Using the fishing cable I measured about 130 feet (40 meters) between the 2nd floor (our office) and the electrical box. If I use copper I guess unshielded cables are not realistic for 10g, but all cat6a/cat7 cables I&#x27;ve been researching are too wide/flexible for the corrugated tube path.

                              <span>Hi everyone! In a PIM sparse scenario with a router acting at the rendezvous point, must all multicast traffic flow through the router? Or will the RP dictate the best path if there is a closer/shorter path? Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi everyone. We are trying to configure a GRE tunnel to pass through ERSPAN traffic. In our environment, we have Cisco FTD that is managed by FDM. In this article as provided by Cisco support, only FMC is capable of creating a pre-filter to allow traffic in a non-compliant GRE tunnel.
 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/70/fdm/fptd-fdm-config-guide-700/fptd-fdm-access.html?bookSearch&#x3D;true
  
How do we conclusively know our GRE tunnel violates the RFC?
 Is the reason why FMC is currently able to create pre-filter based on the fact its a more premium management tool compared to a FDM?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been working in IT for about a year now (not long I know), but I feel like I&#x27;m completely plateauing in my current role. I&#x27;m working as a tier 1 technician for an MSP, but no longer feel that I&#x27;m really learning anything. I&#x27;ve been taking time outside of work to learn what I can and do some certifications, most recently being the AZ-104. They like me and are promising a promotion to a tier 2 position once I get one last cert. It seems to me from looking at some other tier 2 technicians that my current responsibilities won&#x27;t change much at all, just a small pay bump. 
 I&#x27;d really like to build up into some cloud engineering or DevOps eventually as I&#x27;ve found the cloud very interesting and I&#x27;ve always loved to code. It doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ll ever get there by just doing what my company tells me to do, but when I look at other job posting I feel so inadequate. Are there certain projects I could do or anything to help build my skills further? I take every chance I can to create PowerShell scripts and automate things and advance my career past helpdesk, but it feels like 90% of my job is &quot;WhAT iS MFa?! i DoNt WANT tHaT!!&quot;. How am I supposed to differentiate myself from other helpdesk?

 I have a friend who&#x27;s been both a Network Admin and System Admin for about a decade. Currently, working towards Cloud Infrastructure Engineer certifications. I would argue this person is more competent than most experienced and high level admins I&#x27;ve met in my career. This person is driven and basically lives and breathes tech on their own free time second only to sports and pets (Dogs).
 They have worked for MSPs, individual companies, contract to hire, and on their own family run IT company who supports official City projects. They have single handedly migrated businesses from on-prem to cloud. They have worked for law firms, space engineering companies, medical/dental field, and more. Aside from numerous certs, they also have a Double Major including Computer Science, and a …</span>

 Today I told my boss and 2 co-workers I will be retired by late Sept or early Oct.
 Retiring and obtaining/preserving maximum benefits will be the hardest project of my entire life.
 I was cruising along, making good money/benefits, WFH easy peasy. But was tasked to &quot;upgrade&quot; an app that was written over 20 years ago (I have been with the org 16 years). I have been trying to wash my hands of that app for a decade. Looking at the git repo, I last made a change 5 years ago (simple link in HTML).
 That just broke me. I am done, I hope my retirement opens up an opportunity for someone younger. I work for a great team within an great org.
 Peace out.

                              <span>how is this even possible? granted, I&#x27;ve done the RHCSA before which took about 6 months of study for me. 
 ex-colleague, has certifications from Microsoft, AWS, Google, Hashicorp... at the Architect level! it&#x27;s insane. not surprisedly, he is a Director now.
 and it looks like, all gotten within a few months of each other. how the heck is this even possible?
 the RHCSA was draining enough for me and I didn&#x27;t even renew it/do the RHCE (which was my intention before I decided to focus more on my other passions).
 i feel like i am really underachieving.

 Being vague because I don&#x27;t want to out myself.
 Get into work, crisis ongoing, getting worse. Lower tier techs and management not communicating particularly effectively. Poke around the environment and find a thing that can&#x27;t be right. Fix it, 30 second job. All systems normal in about 5 minutes. Management loosing their minds over how what I fixed came to be and coming up with outlandish scenarios for it. I point out that the most logical explanation is the tech trying to fix the first issue tried something and forgot to put it back or bumped something. Get told far and away by all parties there&#x27;s no way that could have happened. I move on because I&#x27;ve got other stuff to do rather then snipe hunt and I wasn&#x27;t out to crucify someone trying (and mostly succeeding) to make…</span>

I am thinking of semi-retiring, but I don&#x27;t really want to do gig or contract work. I&#x27;m going to see if I can talk my employer into reducing my hours, but if that doesn&#x27;t work, have any of you been able to successfully transition out of I.T., and if so, where did you land? I don&#x27;t have any side gigs, either, which probably complicates things a little.

 He is a drain on a department where skillsets are already stagnating. Management just shrugs and says &quot;train them&quot;, then asks why your projects aren&#x27;t being completed when you&#x27;ve spent weeks handholding the most basic tasks. I&#x27;ve counted six users out of our few hundred who seem to have a more solid grasp of computers than the helpdesk employee. 
 Government IT, amirite?

 I get that building a new system is fun but you cant withhold experience from your employees.

 We are using SAML with Azure AD as the authentication source for our Google Workspace users. In Google Workspace Admin there is a setting for Chrome devices that will pass users google username through to Microsoft so the users can then just enter their password without re-entering their username. We have this enabled and it is working properly on Chromebooks (which some of users use.)
 I can not find any way to have this functionality for users on Windows devices using a Chrome browser. In Google Admin panel there is no setting I can find that would enable this type of pass of username to the Microsoft login screen.

                              <span>So my org using Confluence KB for both internal and external documentation. Confluence is hella expensive and I am wondering if anyone has found an easy-to-manage, cloud based or on prem, and cheap software that does this. I have found document360, docuwiki, and sharepoint (which my org already has a license for). There isn&#x27;t anything wrong with Confluence other than we do not use all its features and that it is priced like an Atlassian product. Really, I am just looking for something that can store a combination of text, screenshots, and maybe the occasional video.
 Does anyone have a product they use for a KB that they like? Any recommendations?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 So we use Exchange (hybrid env), PhishER, and Mimecast to control email phishing spam. I&#x27;m now on my second run of a Monday morning where I walk in with 6 phishing tickets that people have reported because 1 spam GMAIL user managed to send some crap to the office, and I already know that more of these will trickle in all day as people see them. We have 400+ users, so it would be a lot.
 Question I have is, as a domain/exchange/o365 admin, is there a tool I *should* have readily available to me that can find and yank emails before these guys have to pop in and find them? I&#x27;ve never needed it before now, so I&#x27;m just hopeful.
 Thanks!!

                              <span>Hi, I work in IT for a small school system. We&#x27;re trying to find some workarounds/alternate methods to issues since it&#x27;s summer and the kids are out. We have a small Meraki network and have a student SSID as well as a teacher SSID, the SSIDs are the same, but the passwords differ by school building. Teachers have been prone to writing their SSID password down on whiteboards and pieces of paper and leaving it where kids are able to see it and make use of it. 
 We&#x27;re looking to find a way to prevent them from being able to do that, and an early idea is trying to bake the password into the SSID so they never get their hands on it. I was thinking of a splash page for teachers that would require them to sign in with their full credentials once and then be all set, but I think I might need all their credentials in advance which would be likely fraught with potential issues. Can anyone recommend an easier/more effective way of saving teachers from themselves? Thank you!

                              <span>We&#x27;re setting up a new EAP-TLS secured WIFI network leveraging NPS and issuing certs to laptops that are largely used off premise via SCEP and NDES. Devices are currently HAADJ (I know!) so in theory could obtain certs directly from a CA but looking to futureproof as ultimately we want to utilise AADJ. In testing we&#x27;re falling foul of the Strong Cert Mapping without manually/scripting populating the AltSecurityAttribute in AD.
 Nothing I&#x27;ve seen from MS yet as to how they&#x27;re going to address this shortcoming and I see the final enforcement has delayed until Nov 23. Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong but I&#x27;m guessing the only viable solution at the moment is to run a scheduled task that looks for certs that have been issued using the specific template and auto populate the AD attributes. If anyone has a fully fledged solution a link would be appreciated or have any insight as to how to work around this?
 Also how do people in their environment work around an issue where a device certificate has expired due to the workstation being offline and it not renewing their cert? Do you have an open WIFI network on premise with only enough access to pull down a new cert via SCEP or GPO?
 This has been asked previously but this thread has been archived so can&#x27;t bump it: https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/yrb7bu/strong_certificate_mapping_w_scep_how_do_you_do_it/

 Due to the 802.11 NPS issue , I want to disable Credential guard. But its not disabling because of Defender AV. How can I disable it ?

I have a 50&quot; TV I can use but IDK if that would be good or not. Also if anyone else has done this, what other configs can you use when splitting a TV? I&#x27;ve seen people do Ultrawide on the bottom then two normal monitors on to and was wondering if that could work too.

                              <span>Running our work mails through a privately hosted exchange, but any email you delete through OWA refuses to delete. It shows it is deleted, but if you sign out and back in, the mail is right back there in the deleted items. Empty folder doesn&#x27;t work either. 
 Only thing I&#x27;ve found online is to remove litigation, but we don&#x27;t have litigation on for any user. 
 It seems to only happen to users who&#x27;s mailboxes had hit their limit before being increased.

                              <span>I have a unit that needs to be domain joined, but regardless of user I would like it to have no access to network shares. I tried locking down the firewall to block SMB through a GPO as part of a newly created security group listing only the piece of hardware. I’ve also made the adjustments manually on the unit itself. I’ve put GPOs in place to block the units access to the server, but as it acts as a domain controller as well, this did not go well.
 I’m sure there is someone out there that regularly does this. Making this user based rather than machine based isn’t an option as the unit is in an open area and while users know not to login with their own credentials it has already happened more than once.
 Any help or ideas would be greatly appreciated.
 Thanks

                              <span>I’ve been in my Sys admin role for a year now, and since day one it’s been pretty chill (coming from an MSP). I’ve gotten to implement new things and fix broken things. No real KPI, and nothing is really ever that urgent. I definitely haven’t conquered the environment, but it’s mostly pretty simple. I get a lot of time to study, focus on strategy, project planning, etc. 
 I now have the opportunity to increase my income 30-40% at an MSP doing infrastructure work. I know for sure it would be more stressful, but I’d learn a lot. 
 The issue I run into is the typical fear of a new environment and new stress, even though I know it would grow me. Anyone else run into this mindset? I find that I was way more ambitious about IT before starting this role. I’m still only 4 years into my career, but I spent the first three really grinding and studying hard. Now I’m more concerned with just enjoying my life, even if it’s on a lower income. 
 This isn’t really a question. More of an open discussion.

 Just got a permanent job from qa and now trying to make my master thesis ready before it starts and need to make a study. I decided to write my thesis on information system modeling and would be very grateful if you are working on IT and could answer this survey which takes 2 minutes. It has questions that study do people use IS modeling and do they think it’s important. It’s completely anonymous. Would hugely gratitude if you have time to answer so I can graduate from school!

My iPhone is set to backup only on trusted WiFi networks to avoid being throttled by my cell company. Assuming my work’s network is trusted since I spend more time there than I do at home, I’m sure a lot of backups to iCloud happen when I’m at work. Is there any way someone in IT who has access could see what’s contained in those backups? Like contacts, conversations (let’s be honest - photos)? Or does the encryption Apple uses prevent this?

 Minimum password age is set to 0. There was a bad update last year I believe on Server 2019, but our DCs are 2022 and are fully patched.
 There is nothing that seems to fix this, except a simple reboot. And it&#x27;s random, does not affect everyone when theirs expires. Also, the systems are hardwired LAN, they are not roaming devices that are off the network/domain like roaming laptops.

                              <span>Hello Everyone, i&#x27;m a fresh Sysadmin and just started my first real job at a company. 
 We got a big TV in our Entryhall and my boss got the idea that he wants this to be a great display of our company. He wants it to play our Company presentation video and wants things like a live weather map, UV map and Windinformation to be displayed next to the video. Of course everything automated so it can run forever without anyone having to turn it on or off or open anything.
 I&#x27;ve thought about things like a custom HTML Page with the video playing and webhooks to get the Weatherinformation integrated into the page. The Problem is i have never done something like that and don&#x27;t really know where to start. i got a Mini PC i could use and connect to the Monitor but i don&#x27;t know what to configure.
 I would be interested if you know some other/simpler ways i could accomplish that goal or maybe just give me some pointers in the right direction.

 I want to enable the Exchange Attribute &quot;msExchHideFromAddressLists&quot; on my DC and push the settings to my Azure AD.
 I did the following tasks:
  
Push Exchange Attribute Schema to DC via Exchange 2019 ISO - worked without issues and I see the attributes in the attributes editor
 Add a value to the MailNickname field in the Attributes Editor
 Pushed a delta and initial sync
  
​
 I followed this manual to enable the HideFromAddressList feature on the Azure AD Connect side via the Synchronization Rules Editor but it doesn&#x27;t show me the attribute at all.
 Manual: https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/en-US/8ef659e8-da58-4c5e-acad-2799f4b864c2/msexchhidefromaddresslists-attribute-isnt-syncing-across-to-azure?forum&#x3D;WindowsAzureAD
 My values: https://imgur.com/a/IX577hV
 What am I doing wrong? Could it be that AzureAD Connect did not properly sync with the DC to pull the new attributes?
 Any help is greatly appreciated, thank you very much!

                              <span>So, over the years at this company we&#x27;ve tried to do NTFS Permissions properly but what really confuses me every time is the following:
 We have a folder called DATA
 In that we have all the company folders that don&#x27;t have inheritance 
 One folder is called FINANCE and in that we have FOLDER A
 I need to get a new user to the FINANCE folder and ONLY to FOLDER A inside of finance. The only, messy way I know to do this is to give the user LIST FOLDER CONTENTS to FINANCE folder, then turn off inheritance on FOLDER A and give that user specific permissions to that folder.
 I&#x27;m thinking this is the wrong way of doing it but can&#x27;t think of the better way.

                              <span>I&#x27;m in my second year in service desk and feel like I have a fair amount of knowledge considering my age and time in this field. I am looking to upskill and have been studying towards a AWS certification but I really struggle to find the motivation or the time to study. How do you wizards put in the effort to study for certifications? Any tips to pass on to the next generation?

                              <span>Can anybody tell me how to disable this nuisance feature in Windows 10 please? 
 I know how to disable it in the notifications section and in the registry for a single user profile but I&#x27;d like to know how to disable it for all users.
 I successfully logged on as a local admin but when I try to log on with my domain admin account I&#x27;m stuck in a never ending cycle of BS. It&#x27;s not moving past the Account setup step - I see from other pages that there used to be a &quot; Remind me in 3 days&quot; option but that&#x27;s no longer available.

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to install ADFS in my homelab. The idea is to try and learn how to use on-prem AD accounts to login on cloud apps using Azure AD without syncing on-prem accounts to the cloud - intro ADFS.
 I have my own domain (foo.bar) registred on Cloudflare and I&#x27;m runing a Windows Server 2019 VM with installed AD using the same DC domain foo.bar.
 I issued a certificate request using IIS and created a signed SSL certificate out of Cloudflare while being cautious to use the right CN and SAN&#x27;s as stated here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/set-up-an-ad-fs-lab-environment#install-a-server-ssl-certificate
 I have the root certificate installed and Cloudflare issued certificates are trusted. When I install the Cloudflare certificate, I can use it on my machine for websites and such, but when I try to add the certificate in the ADFS installation process it&#x27;s simply not visible. Even importing .pfx file doesn&#x27;t work.
 Any idea what I&#x27;m doing wrong?

 I may found a problem, my CN is &#x27;CN &#x3D; CloudFlare Origin Certificate&#x27; while the tutorial states it should be adfs1.foo.bar https://imgur.com/a/RPRkdHQ Any idea how to fix this?

                              <span>Morning!
 At my work, we have 2 pc’s that are used for confidential document scanning. The pc’s only need access to an internal system to upload the documents. The devices have been autopiloted and are hybrid AD joined. 
 We use meraki for our networks, and defender for endpoint. I need to find a solution for these pc’s to block all access to any website except the one mentioned above. The devices still need to be able to update via windows update, and link back to defender. Another application that need network access is our remote support application. So the team can assist users on the PC’s where needed. The PC’s cannot allow the users to login to office.com. 
 I have looked at blocking all network access and whitelisting the ip/web addresses through the firewall, but the list is huge. Is there another solution for this?

                              <span>My company runs critical industrial hardware, and pays maintenance on it. 
 In order to reduce downtime, maintainers can get access to their machines, using our Forti SSL portal.
 Authentication is done with an AD account, that we create for every person allowed to access our hardware, typically with a random password, to be changed at first connection.
 The issue is that hardware is pretty reliable these days, and maintainers only connect a few times a year, at most, and every single time cannot remember the password they set.
 Since things break down in the middle of the night or the weekend, as they always do, it’s always a call to the on-call person to reset the password, which is silly.
 Do you have similar issues? How do you handle that?
 (On the maintainer side, all of them have the same answer - they don’t understand why TeamViewer is not used like everywhere else, but my security colleagues think it is not a good idea at all to allow that on mission critical hardware, and I tend to agree)

                              <span>We have recently deployed a U6 Pro AP within our infrastructure, which is the sole Unifi device in operation within the organisation.
 One of our main goals with this is to enable the support of a Guest Wi-Fi SSID which supports client isolation to ensure that guests have restricted access on the network.
 I have enabled the hotspot portal to achieve this and configured the settings as needed in the portal.
 Within the Pre-Authorisation Allowances, I have added the IP addresses of the internal DNS servers, the default gateways, along with 8.8.8. However, when clients are connected, they are unable to resolve any hostnames. They can ping via IP.
 Our anti-virus does put its own DNS into the IP configuration of clients. I added this IP as a pre-auth, but I had no luck. 
 As a test, I had amended the AV policy on my laptop to use the static DNS servers within the organisation (also added as allowed pre-auth IPs) and flushed the DNS cache.
 However, I am still unable resolve hostnames across devices.
 Due to the above, the captive portal never displays on the devices connected to the Guest network.
 I can&#x27;t get access into Unifi support to be able to query this. Just cannot get DNS working for the life of me. I can see DNS queries going back and forth between my laptop and the DNS server via Wireshark.

                              <span>Using AD. We have our external domain &quot;domain.com&quot; as our on prem domain as well. This predated me so I know this isn&#x27;t best practice.
 ​
 We&#x27;ve had a request that &quot;domain.com&quot; in a web browser goes to their externally hosted website. This seems to be an issue for obvious reason. 
 ​
 Is there any solution to this outside of renaming the on-prem domain or setting up IIS on each DC to redirect to the external website? Yes I know this is also bad practice.
 ​
 I already believe this isn&#x27;t possible. At least not without making a mess so I&#x27;m happy to push back and say it can&#x27;t be done providing I&#x27;ve not missed an obvious solution!

 we get a lot of Dell Devices with Windows 10/11 which dont get added to a Domain. All of the devices have several language versions of Office 365, which all need to be uninstalled in order to Uninstall our version of Office 2019. Is there a way to simplify the uninstall process ? The Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant does that but is not portable and needs a Internet connection, also I did not have any luck creating a batch file for it.

 Since a few days, Bginfo display Default Gateway as 0.0.0.0
 when i check in my local network card, gateway is still correct. 
 in bginfo, when i make a custom field to get DefautlIPGateway, i have lots of (null) and then my real gateway IP.
 how can i make BGinfo to display Ip disregarding the (null) fields ?
 or is there somewhere in registry some cleanup to make ?
 thanks for your help.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I am looking to deploy an online print server on Azure. It should connect to my local HP LaserJet M15w when it goes online and then start to print the queue. The queue will be primarily filled with files from an Azure function/ LogicApp.
 What would you recommend as a free, open source printserver? It should be as simple and low maintenance as possible. I looked into CUPS, but this seems to be build to run locally?

                              <span>Hi,
 Environment: Active directory with DHCP and DNS active, DNS dynamic updates: secure only.
 I have a problem with the dynamic updates of dns records. I notice that when i change the network card(aka vlan) of a virtual machine on Vmware, the dns record of the machine it&#x27;s not updated on the DC. I saw that the problem is present only when a previous A record exists.. So it almost seems that the old dns records are not deleted. 
 Any suggestions to resolve the problem?
 Thanks in advance.

Does anyone have the golden tip?

                              <span>Hi Guys
 I have a requirement for a copy which I don‘t think Robocopy can address, but would love to be proved wrong.
 The scenario is that our admin screwed up a server migration so we have a bunch of OLD files/folders on our target (that do not exist on our source). However as the server has been used, we also have new files folders that have been created from say “today”
 Is there a way for robocopy (or any other CLI tool) to:
 Remove all files on the target that do NOT exist int the source BUT ignores any files that were created today/ 1 day old / newer than a certain date (Like today’s date)
 I know things like /mir or /purge will delete orphan files on the target, but that will include any files created today
 I also know we can use /xo or /xn but that only applies to the source I believe.
 I don’t think Robocopy can do this…as it’s an unusual request, but hoping i’m wrong.

                              <span>Hi All,
 I have taken over our Gmail admin account, and is tasked with making the usernames better. People have been running wild and the former admin gave them whatever they wanted.
 Just to give you an idea, we have a person in management with the e-mail [TheDragon@domian.com](mailto:TheDragon@domian.com) and we also have one called [TheCount@domain.com](mailto:TheCount@domain.com)
 I have the following I want to do/need help with:
  
Owners want [firstname@domain.com](mailto:firstname@domain.com) for their e-mail addresses and so be it
 For employees I want to do [firstname.lastname@domain.com](mailto:firstname.lastname@domain.com)
  
My big issue is:
  
We have point of sales pc&#x27;s with shared e-mails for each store, those are a mess.
 Some are name after what the store sells like [teddybears@domain.com](mailto:teddybears@domain.com) and others are named what the employees think sound logic or cool like [teddybarstoreInCityname@domain.com](mailto:teddybarstoreInCityname@domain.com)
 What is a good naming practice for this?
 Many of our users don&#x27;t have their own e-mail, since they just use the store e-mail.
 I want every user to have their own e-mail, is this wrong?
 There are no mailing groups, so if you want to mail all the store owners then you have to know who they are, should I setup some groups?
  
Thanks in advance for any help :)

                              <span>Networking noob here.
 Clients in my company have problems accessing an internal homepage during certain hours of the day.
 WinMTR shows a foreign IP (198.19.250.2) as first node on the way to the application server. It is not a known IP of our network.
 The problems started around the same time we upgraded to ESET Protect Complete and someone else fiddled around with our Sophos to configure an IPSec VPN tunnel to a different site.
 All clients are Windows 10, the application server in question is Ubuntu Server.
 How can I figure out why the first node is not the specified gateway?
 I blocked all traffic to the foreign IP for now because it seems like an attack to me.
 Hosts file is correct, network settings on the clients are correct, outside of a certain time of the day (~7:30 to 8:30) WinMTR shows the correct gateway and there are no performance problems. I also haven&#x27;t found the IP in our Sophos UTM config anywhere.Deleting DNS cache or ARP cache does not solve the problem. 2 different AV scanner haven&#x27;t found anything.
 Any help is appreciated greatly!

 If accessing a smb share via Hostname, it works without issue.
 If accessing same smb share via ip, it will instantly cause the account to get locked out.

                              <span>Hi All. 
 So I&#x27;ve recently implemented Protected Users for a customer&#x27;s domain. We&#x27;ve added only users with Domain Admin to the group. Aware of NTLM and CredSSP being disabled in these circumstances.
 So far so good.
 Got a bit of a curveball that I didn&#x27;t realise would be an issue. User reports being unable to RDP onto a server. It turns out the hostname is actually a SQL Failover Cluster. They can log into both nodes individually with no issue, but trying to use the cluster hostname, that should then always forward the user to the active node, will fail.
 It looks like it&#x27;s throwing an error about the connecting computer not supporting NLA, which I suspect is also caused by Protected Users disabling a bunch of protocols for the included users.
 ​
 Does anyone know if there&#x27;s something I can configure to get around this, or will users in the Protected Users group have to connect using the hostname of the specific nodes and not able to use the cluster name?

                              <span>An email is sent from one domain using Microsoft Exchange Online (entity 1). It is addressed to a recipient who as it turns out also has Microsoft Exchange Online (entity 2).
 Entity 1&#x27;s tenant is configured with Mimecast Email Protection and uses an Outbound Connector to send ALL email via Mimecast. Entity 2&#x27;s email protection is unknown.
 Normal emails from entity 1 to external parties (inc. Gmail and Outlook) deliver OK and are received OK. Email headers show the email sender IP is 103.96.23.103 - which is Mimecast. SPF passes, DKIM shows as dkim:entity1server:mimecast20181211 and DMARC is aligned. All green ticks when run through MX Toolbox&#x27;s header analyzer.
 Emails from the entity 1 to entity 2 however... these are delivered to entity 2&#x27;s spam/junk folder (this was confirmed by calling entity 2 and asking if they&#x27;ve received the email). 
 Checking Mimecast message tracing, and even getting the headers of the email that entity 2 received (by way of them forwarding back as an attachment) show in the MX Toolbox header analyzer that the sender IP is 104.47.71.239 - which is Microsoft. SPF fails, DKIM shows as dkim:entity1server.onmicrosoft.com:selector2-entity1server-onmicrosoft-com, and DMARC alignment fails. Even though the email appears in the Mimecast outbound logs when a message trace is run.
 It&#x27;s like the email is being handed directly from Exchange to Exchange even though it&#x27;s going through the outbound connector and subject to the Mimecast outbound policies.
 How and why is this happening?
 Is the solution to simply add inlclude:spf.protection.outlook.com to the domain&#x27;s DNS TXT SPF record or is there more required to deal with the DKIM? 
 FWIW - Entity 1&#x27;s Mimecast and Exchange tenant configuration is as per Mimecast recommendation.

                              <span>I have a domain I created on a test server. I&#x27;ll call it public.mydomain.net.
 My work domain is public.workdomain.net.
 I have GPOs set up the way I want them for mydomain. I want to export the GPOs from them, then import them to WorkDomain.
 Questions:
 Will this work as intended? What could go wrong? What would happen if there are templates that I had installed on my test machine but are not installed on WorkDomain? For instance, I know for a fact that Google policies are not installed on WorkDomain, but I&#x27;d installed them and had set some Google Policies up.
 I really would like to avoid tedious work of having to Copy/Paste policy settings from one PC to another.
 I do know that there are Backup/Restore options and Import options for each GPO. If Powershell is involved, I&#x27;m comfortable with that as well.

                              <span>Hey guys, 
 I have been in help desk since 2017. I have been at my current job/company for a year and a half and they have been telling me for a while now they are going to move me to an admin spot. I have been doing a lot of the system admin duties/ job already. But we have had 2 admin spots come open in the last 6 months (1 was a brand new spot) and they didn’t even give me an interview….
 The director is the one wanting to hire me as an admin, but the VP of technology is the one that hired the last 2 guys even thought the director is the hiring manager and supervisor of the spots. VP didn’t even let him in on the interviews that were given.
 I am making decent money but I am really starting to get discouraged and seeing no end to my help desk spots. Every job that comes available say they want 7+ years experience but I can’t get experience with getting hired lol..
 I am wanting some thoughts on what y’all think I can do.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Has anyone had issues connecting to a Microsoft Display Adaptor from HP laptops running Intel Wireless? We&#x27;ve had numerous issues with people connecting to these adaptors after recent Windows and intel driver updates. Other users with older driver versions have no issues. This is on both Windows 10 and 11.

                              <span>Recently I&#x27;ve been looking for certifications other than purely technical focused and I came across the ITIL exams. I had never heard of them and from what I can gather they are a kind of gold standard for IT operations and IT project management. Since a lot of the information I found comes from &quot;Best IT cert &quot; lists on random sites I was wondering do you all feel like it&#x27;s a journey worth exploring? Mind you the cost for taking a training/foundation exam is roughly $800 to $1000
 ​
 Context about me: I work as a junior sysadmin of shorts in a midsized company. I hope to grow in the company I&#x27;m at but where that will take me is fairly opened. I would like to become a network engineer/architect down the line and that is why the ITIL cert piqued my interest

                              <span>as per title
 My CEO is wanting to celebrate every milestone we hit this year and wants to know how to make the computers for all users &#x27;explode&#x27; with confetti and celebration when we reach a milestone.
 I told him we could use teams, but he said he doesnt want users to use an app! it shoudl just explode on their screen.....
 ​
 ​
 so.... Im asking for help haha
 ​
 But thinking as a Manager - and someone whose CEO gave him direct instructions I thought, this could be a cool concept....
 We reach a milestone, maybe a user posts praise on teams about making some money and bam, all users get a pop up, some confetti graphics rain overlay over the desktop screen and so the whole company can know at once and celebrate....
 But nonetheless I have never heard of anything like this whatsoever! kind of sounds more like a virus...
 So Whilst I setup a demonstration of Cheers/Praise within Teams for him tomorrow, I thought I would ask the world if they have heard of anything like this?
 Environment is all windows 10. We use Teams. Moving to AAD.
 TL;DR:
 Is there a way for computers to rain confetti and inform all computer users that we have reached a milestone! (literal graphics overlay on the PC - when we manually select it to)

                              <span>Hey Guys,
 ​
 My old DC is 2012 so I created a new 2022 server, promoted it and copied all the dhcp/nps etc config over and then transferred the fusmo roles. Everything seems to be working so after a few days I turned my old DC off to see how it would go before demoting.
 ​
 It seems to be perfectly fine, but I have noticed if I run dcdiag I get the below error.
 ​
 [Replications Check,NEWDC] A recent replication attempt failed:
 From OLDDC to NEWDC
 Naming Context: DC&#x3D;DomainDnsZones,DC&#x3D;domain,DC&#x3D;wa,DC&#x3D;edu,DC&#x3D;au
 The replication generated an error (1256):

 ​
 Is this just because I have the old DC turned off and will fix itself when I turn it back on and demote it?
 I also have a second DC running 2016 that has essentially the same error. I am also planning on creating a new 2022 DC to replace that server.
 ​
 Am I safe to demote the old DC and create another DC to replace the 2016 DC and then demote the old 2016DC as well?

Coming from a MSP background, I&#x27;ve handled my fair share of complex networks and IT projects. However, this is my first foray into an internal IT role, and I could really use some guidance from those who&#x27;ve been in my shoes.
 Let&#x27;s start with the glaring issues. All computers in the company are currently using local accounts, with each user having local administrator access. This is a significant security and management concern that I am eager to address immediately.
 My first instinct is to migrate to Active Directory. Azure AD seems to be a good solution to allow me to manage everything from the cloud. However, I am concerned about migrating the existing local profiles. Is there a pain-free…</span>

 I&#x27;ve been working on learning powershell and python, and maybe I&#x27;m just not creative, but what do you guys actually automate? Really the only thing I&#x27;ve come up with is automating /scheduling the clock in process for employees (I&#x27;m salary, this was just to prove to a buddy in hr that our clock in process is easily faked). 
 I can totally see the use of it in bigger environments but for the small guys, what can we do?

                              <span>Hello Everyone,
 I&#x27;ve been working in my first job as an applications engineer for Windows server apps for the last couple of years. Now I got an offer to work as a Citrix and general infrastructure admin. More Infrastructure experience is certainly good for my CV but am I setting myself up for a dead technology here? I&#x27;m worried about the future importance of RDS/Citrix, etc. as more and more client server apps are becoming web-only.
 Any thoughts appreciated, Thanks in advance!

                              <span>So I recently there was a decision in my company, that we&#x27;ll be switching from CentOS to Ubuntu Server. Okay, management &quot;found&quot; this &quot;new&quot; packaging format, called Snaps, and asked me to investigate, if it would be good for our company to use.
 I never was a huge fan of Ubuntu and Snaps in general, but now, when I dug deeper into it, I&#x27;m stunned. Really, it looks like Ubuntu doesn&#x27;t give a single F about Snaps, allowing them to rot and become unusable.
 Two quick examples, that are ESSENTIAL in app development:
  
Docker - published by Canonical, latest version in snaps is 20.10.24, released April 4th, in Docker APT repo we have 24.0 already, two versions ahead
 Jenkins - published by Snapcrafters (star developer, responsible for example for Gimp, Discord, Android Studio, Sublime), in Snaps latest stable version is 2.290, released IN APRIL OF 2021!
  
Weren&#x27;t Snaps supposed to be a way for developers to publish official packages, up to date and self-contained? A way to install latest version of software even on older distro release? 
 In my humble opinion, it&#x27;s just harmful. If Canonical is going to push Snaps down our throats, delete APT versions in favour of Snaps, shouldn&#x27;t they make absolutely sure, we are getting up-to-date and supported versions of software? Especially, since they advertise Snaps as a great way to install production-ready, stable and up-to-date packages in enterprise environment?

                              <span>I am new to an office and there is an existing setup using Avaya Phones.
 The phones have this weird deal where it will receive a &quot;phantom&quot; phone call. It will ring twice, then stopped. If one answers the phone, there is nothing, there is a beeping (not a fax sound, just a beeping Beep-Boop back and forth). The Caller ID contains a broken string (see picture). When called back, the phone plays the busy tone.
 I have tried looking through Comcasts call logs, no sign of inbound calls. They appear to happen on every line. (we have 9 lines that enter through an Avaya hub.
 I have no idea how to get into the hub (I can&#x27;t seem to find the IP address) and the calls are getting worse. today they&#x27;ve rung 50 times since the office opened. 
 Does anyone have any suggestions?

                              <span>I was doing a market analysis to make sure my sysadmins are getting paid fairly, and found that job title (Sysadmin I, II, III) seems to have fallen out of use in the last year or two. What is your job title now... especially at a bigger company? (We&#x27;re 2k, not huge, but I don&#x27;t want my team poached over pay at larger companies.) 
 And before people ask, yes, market analysis is a starting point. The ones that perform the best earn more.

                              <span>I&#x27;m scheduled to have a 3rd round interview for mid-level Sysadmin position (I already got through a great 2nd round interview with the Senior Sysadmin/Hiring Manager)
 The 3rd interview will be with the Jr. Sysadmin and the &quot;Director of Quality&quot;.
 I&#x27;m assuming the Jr. Sysadmin will be there mostly to see how they like me on a personal level. But I&#x27;m wondering what sorts of things the Director of Quality will be asking me (I&#x27;ve never heard of this job title before), and what sorts of questions should I be asking this person?
 Based on the LinkedIn profile of the Director of Quality, they handle a lot of compliance related issues (it’s for a biotech company). But the job listing did not emphasize deep knowledge of regulations (only briefly mentioned knowledge of HIPAA as a “plus”)
 Seems curious that the hiring manager/Senior Sysadmin would send me to an additional interview with both the Junior Syasadmin AND the Director of Quality in the same interview, so I’m kinda confused as to what I should expect from this interview, and what sorts of questions I should ask?

 However, I&#x27;m finding myself increasingly unhappy with the bugs, their support and the painfully slow speed of their web interface.
 We are currently paying $5.50/device for around 100 devices. I&#x27;m wondering if any other admins have an alternative service to recommend that is either the same price or cheaper and offers some benefit compared to Mosyle.
 There&#x27;s a fair amount of threads on here about MDM in general but it would need to be one that supports education specifically - so that the Education-specific profiles for Classroom and Shared iPad continue to work.

 Due to rebranding , I will migrate all new DNS records to new DNS Zone.
 Old DNS Zone : company.co.uk
 New DNS Zone : newcompany.co.uk
 I am working on old DNS zone cleanup. How to check each DNS Record usage and where it is getting used in AD infrastructure.

                              <span>Hey everyone, i wanted to show you what i created since the last year. I created my own Platform named &#x27;Honeyweb&#x27; using C# for the client application and php and mysql for the backend. Honeyweb is a lightweight communication client that got many features over the last updates.
 Current features:
 - Watchparty Mode (Watch Youtube-Videos synchronized)
 - Gaming Companion (Meet new people: Tinder-Like feature)
 - Universal Launcher (Add every application to one launcher)
 - Profiles (Custom Profile Background, Badges)
 and the basics like adding friends to your friendslist, send messages and more!
 Trailer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v&#x3D;JPXrFFGspm8
 i only want to show my work :)

                              <span>Hey!
 You know how we keep bumping into companies where SSH keys and passwords are all over the place? And every user and their dog are using the same key? Revoking access in this scenario is almost impossible.
 When I talk to IT teams, they&#x27;re like, &quot;Oh, we need some pricey &#x27;zero trust&#x27; solution to fix this. And guess what, it&#x27;s not in the budget.&quot; But when I tell them there&#x27;s a free open-source way to do it, they look at me like I&#x27;ve grown a second head.
 So, to prove them wrong, I wrote this nifty script. It uses PAM, SSSD, and the Google Authenticator PAM module. What it does is, it lets your Linux machines authenticate with Google Workspace, AD, or other IdPs. And the cherry on top? It can even set up 2FA for you.
 Here&#x27;s the link to my script: https://github.com/smulikHakipod/idm-ssh-configurator
 I&#x27;m hoping some of you find this useful. Or at least, I hope it gets you thinking that maybe managing SSH keys doesn&#x27;t need to be such a mess.
 Cheers!

                              <span>We are a small MSP, and we have been using Hyper-V as our hypervisors for the past many years. Always using local storage, no clustering at all. We tried S2D at some point, but had major problems with it, so since then we&#x27;ve been sticking with local storage and it works really well for what we need.
 Hardware has been replaced/upgraded multiple times over the years, and we have gone from Datacenter 2016, to 2019, and recently to 2022. Every time we upgraded (software or hardware), we just migrated VM&#x27;s on to a new host, always worked like a charm.
 We have different generations of hardware running in different environments (2-3 hypervisor hosts per environment), most of the older hypervisors are running Intel Xeon, with the more recent servers running AMD EPYC.

                              <span>Hi,
 We have a couple of laptops that were given out during lockdown. Some are joined to the domain, some are workstations but user logged in with their Azure AD account and some are logging in with a local user account but accessing Office 365 with their credentials
 They are all going to be Azure joined laptops now. Is the best plan:
 1) Domain joined - wipe and reset and log in at OOBE
 2) local login - same, wipe and reset? Or can they login in with Azure AD credentials and enroll?
 3) logged in with Azure AD credentials. Can I &quot;just&quot; try enroll this to Intune to make them a corporate laptop?
 I&#x27;m looking for the cleanest way, even if it will cause more work in the short term.

IT Support job has an IT Team with someone to supervise the line work but the IT Admin job has no such guidance so i would he completely on my own. Although, the work lifestyle in the IT Administrator job looks very laid back while the IT Support role looks pretty daunting. I suppose that would be due to how big the business is. Overall my skills in IT is on par with IT Support level 3 and my IT Administrator skill set is rather lacking but the person who wanted to hire in me in the IT Admin role told me he feels that i will be able to do good things and learn in the company. Im just looking for a sign as to which to go for or a bit of convincing. Kindly help me

 I&#x27;m curious about large companies, I&#x27;m talking like fortune 500, how do they keep their laptops up to date? 
 The place I work at (a bank), uses BMC CM for patching desktops as well as laptops and while the desktops are easy, laptops are a huge pain. They always seem to be behind and take a long time being patched. 
 I&#x27;m interested in how you professionals do it. Windows update? Deferred updates? Another patch management software maybe? Or maybe even organizational policies enforcing users to keep their devices updated? 
 Would love to hear your ideas/opinions/experience with this!

                              <span>Hey,
 So recently we purchased 3 laptops - hp elite book g9. We have the e5 license for all devices. 
 Tried both windows 10 enterprise iso and pro iso 22h2 and even windows 11 22h2 pro,with the same issue. 
 It&#x27;s having a weird behaviour every time i reinstall/and enroll it to the domain.
 Most often there is a process called vmemm taking up upwards of 1.5 gb of memory.
 Another is when Microsoft application guard goes upto 90% and fails and loops edge opening. On some resets this is fixed.
 This issue happens on all domain join after reset. after awhile the whole desktop freezes up, like not being able to click on the taskbar or desktop icons, but if I press the win key it fixes this desktop and task bar. But issue appears again.
 Our usual laptop enrollment goes like: * reset * change name, restart * create admin account * run a basic Ps script that disables few functions) * enroll to domain using user account * switch user 
 Keep resetting it because I can&#x27;t seem to leave the domain either. When I try to leave and provide the password it says its incorrect.
 The laptops work fine before domain join. I tried enrolling another old lenovo laptop, it&#x27;s able to join, leave and reset with no issues whatsoever.
 On Monday I&#x27;m gonna try an older iso like 20h2 and update it to the latest version instead.
 Any thoughts will be much appreciated.

                              <span>Hey All 
 What&#x27;s the best way to set up an SLA tracker / Wan failover on a FortiGate without the SDWAN License? Currently, we have 2 ISP and source based ECMP enabled on two 10gb circuits. In a recent outage, the primary wan default gateway was still responding to ping but the carrier had an issue that led reachability failing beyond the default gateway. This inability to reach the internet prevented the route from being removed from the routing table leading to connectivity issues. How do I how make the FortiGate remove a default route if it can&#x27;t ping Google but the link is still up and the next hop is still responding? Fortigates are running 7.2.5.

                              <span>When assigning the FTD&#x27;s local IPv4 address-pools to a tunnel-group for AnyConnect VPN client IP assignment, what does the ASA do when you have multiple pools assigned to the same tunnel-group?
 IE: A business grows and requires more IPs for RAVPN users. /24 is in place, but we will need to double this and add another /24. Expanding the pool isn&#x27;t an option because the IP space is not contiguous.
 TAC says the FTD will exhaust the first pool of addresses before assigning any from the second pool. I am assuming this is probably true but it&#x27;d be nice to see it in a document or hear from someone else that this is how it works.

                              <span>I do a lot of music festivals where I have machines surrounded by tens of thousands of mobile devices that clog up the cellular network and create havoc with wifi.
 I need to communicate with my machines wirelessly, as running cable is not an option.
 Can you suggest a way to cover a km or so with multiple points in a crowded environment? A solution that avoids GSM/2.4/5gHz perhaps?
 Has anyone tried using point to multipoint devices (like the tp-link cpe210) in crowded areas?
 Prefer not to use point to point devices like the Ubiquiti Nano Beam where you have to have visual line of sight between pairs of devices.

 What is a current BCP for L3VPN from ISP perspective? What customer is allowed to advertise into? And is there any filtering on ISP site?
 I mean when its multi-site l3vpn(vrf from ISP perspective) with multiple BGP session on edge. 
 Is there any BCP or ISP os fine with PERMIT-ANY

                              <span>Hi,
 I am trying to setup some resilience in our WAN. We currently have a 100Gb link between two data centres and will soon have 2x 1Gb links to a third site, we currently only have the one. So we will end up with a triangle with the base of that triangle being 100Gb between the two DCs. This 100Gb must stay up at all times and not be affected by spanning tree. Am I correct in thinking that if I make the ports for this Admin Adge this we be the case. I can then enable spanning tree over the 1Gb links and one of those will be blocked and this wont affect the other link?
 ​
 Thanks

 Data Collector &#x3D; 192.168.0.33
 Data Server (Database and Webserver) &#x3D; 0.32
 PC Etherner Adapter &#x3D; 0.8 
 PC Wifi &#x3D; 0.9
 Access Point Router &#x3D; 0.1 
 The PC is is connected to a network of 12 machines with IP address from 0.35 to 0.46 with the help of 4 WAGO hubs in between. The router is connected to machine 0.35 and 0.43 (in two LAN ports). When I ping from my PC (0.8) to router (0.1) , it is successful. But when I connect PC to the same router network within same IP range, it does connect, but it cannot load the webserver at 0.32 address in browser, unlike with ethernet (0.8) which easily load the website.
 Please help me figure out what could be the problem.

I&#x27;d like to get more involved in infrastructure as code, network automation, etc. At this point I can write basic python scripts but have no formal CS training. A CCIE on the other hand might be more sought after in the networking world, and would allow me to really drill down on protocols. I&#x27;m currently a CCNP with 6 years experience. I&#x27;m just worried the newest iteration of the CCIE is very Cisco-proprietary and I work in a Arista/Juniper shop. Which do you think will be more useful for the next 3 decades of my career?

                              <span>I’m not the one in charge of networking, I handle MDM, Microsoft stuff (Intune, endpoint, azure, entra or whatever they’re calling everything this week) and accounts. I was setting up co-management to use the SCCM client for unattended remote access on AzureAD only devices but I noticed that they weren’t showing up in DNS forward lookup. They’re all in reverse lookup, they’re in DHCP, DHCP successfully registers non Windows devices in forward lookup but non local AD Windows devices were not showing up. I tried to allow secure and insecure updates in our office to check but that didn’t fix it. The only way I’ve been able to get them in forward lookup is disabling name protection on DHCP. I could get it if only the domain joined Windows devices we imaged to AD didn’t show up but over half our devices are AzureAD already and none of them are in forward lookup. Like I said, I’m not the networking guy and I’ve just been trying to look through all the settings and see what I could find. Anyone have an idea?

                              <span>Let&#x27;s say I buy a BGAN terminal and prepaid card from one country and travel to a neighboring country. Will the BGAN internet still work if I am within the satelite coverage, or will the service provider intentionally block internet access because my access location doesn&#x27;t match the country the prepayed card was ordered from?

                              <span>So right now I am trying to set up some bonded 10G interfaces for a Ceph cluster.
 Switch is a Arista 7124SX running EOS 4.8.6
 I have 3 nodes, each with 2x 10G interfaces. I configured them for LACP and connected them to the switch. 
 It looks like this: https://imgur.com/a/XPEHkhA
 I then configured the port channels on the switches, and they negotiated properly, as far as I can tell. 
 However, I can&#x27;t ping the servers from each other. None of the ARP requests are getting answered.
 Here&#x27;s the kicker, I disabled the bond and port channel for one of the nodes, and then was able to ping the other one just fine! So the port channel wasn&#x27;t messed up, AFAIK.
 I tried it the other way, flip-flopping who had the bonded interfaces, same result.
 So the question is:
 Is it not possible to traverse between two port channels on the same switch? Or am I missing something here?
 I can provide configs if needed, but I think this is mostly a higher level (my brain) thing that&#x27;s going on.

                              <span>Hey ya all, looking to get some guidance to advance my career and make more money. So I have been doing IT support/Helpdesk for about 5 years now ever since I started college. I have a bachelor’s in IT which I just finished focused on networking which I completed last December and have Comptia A+ and net+. I want to get out of Helpdesk/IT support role and go towards Sysadmin or cloud engineering role and possibly eventually go to cyber security track. Right now I am making 61k and Helpdesk does seem to eventually would top off at 70k possibly. 
 I want to break into 6 figures (eventually maybe make my own business in IT)
 So what can I do? What else should I learn? What certs I should get? What should I learn more while still working in IT support role? Also whatever I have to learn, how much can I avoid coding especially advance coding (not really big fan coding on a computer a whole day and practice leetcode all the time like some of my coder friends do)

                              <span>As the title says I need some advise on changing my career or forming a new path. 
 My current title is a Application Administrator. My responsibilities currently involve rolling out any new software purchased within IT or by any of the other departments in the organization. This requires working the data center team to get a new virtual server setup, the network or security teams to allow clients to access the application if necessary. After rollout of the application we try to be first point of contact for troubleshooting any issues and scheduling patches/upgrades. As of right now me and my team handle about 60 or so applications and list doesn&#x27;t seem stop growing. 
 The reason I want to make a career change is that I feel that I am not learning anything I can transfer anywhere else and the tasks and daily work are generally not very fulfilling. I have other things I do outside of work with my homelab I think are more interesting to me, specifically all the stuff I can do with my proxmox server.
 I was considering maybe getting a vmware cert but I am not sure where to start or what the job market for a entry level vmware engineer/admin looks like. If anyone with experience in that field can let me know what is involved in the getting the cert and what day-to-day of the job would like, it would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>I’m a senior systems engineer right now with 12 years experience. Everything feels really easy and not at all challenging at this point. Where can I realistically go after being a senior systems engineer? Management comes to mind but I don’t have a bachelors degree. I’m making ~90k right now and want to move up the ladder a bit. 
 Has anyone else here specialized in a certain field and found it easier to make more?

                              <span>I managed to boot Windows 11 Pro (Preview Build 25381.1) on a ReFS drive. I heard about it and the most available guides out there they used a VM, I installed it on a bare metal and booting windows from it, using just as NTFS formatted drive. https://imgur.com/TJpFu4n
 Since this is a the future of Windows File system, I thought I&#x27;d give it a go. It&#x27;s has been 2 days and so far so good but with some interesting trade-off. 
 It&#x27;s either psychological or just the some executions (mainly read/write tasks) are slow compared to NTFS. Some apps on MS store aren&#x27;t installing such as snipping tool, but the rest are OK; only a few hickups.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a &#x27;IT Project Engineer&#x27; who is applying to sysadmin-esque jobs. I really want to be in a sysadmin role within the next year..
 I&#x27;ve passed the comptia trifecta - did some AWS and Azure certs (architect/administrator)
 I made a github and have been filling it with scripts and things I write/homelab configurationsI&#x27;ve only failed 2 exams - CCNA and RHCSA. Both of which I only blew by like 30 points..
 Would it be a red flag to have an RHCSA if you have no &#x27;professional&#x27; experience with linux?
 I would like to maybe retake one of these - does anyone have advice on all-around useful certifications / things to know before you are a sysadmin ?
 ​
 I have heavy experience with windows but the only real professional experience I have with linux systems is my labbing experience.
 ​
 It doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to be either of these exams.. but I just am a little lost on what to be working on? Most of the stuff I&#x27;ve been applying to is like Jr Sysadmin / tier 2 helpdesk

Is there an application that works with 0366 that we can install on their PC to authenticate instead? We looked at Authy but we can&#x27;t find a way for it to work with 0365. 
 Any suggestions, fire away!

Bit of a noob question here: it seems like a lot of people here are actively applying and seeing what&#x27;s out there while happily employed at their current job. What do you do about the reference check/awkward situation where a potential employer might contact your current employer during the process? Does this happen?
 Edit: this is my first industry relevant position out of school

 Couldn’t i just say if it is coming from lap-001 then do not ask for mfa.
 I figured mfa really shines if a password is stolen and used elsewhere.
 I don’t anticipate a password being stolen and a user’s physical laptop also being stolen.
 Edit: remember when trying to balance usability with security to always mind your organizations risk tolerance!

 Apologize if this isn&#x27;t the best suitable subreddit, but its the first and best one I can think of.
 I recently bought a used laptop (Thinkpad) and it came with Windows 11 Pro. I pick language, keyboard layout, wait for a while and a welcome/login screen appears. I wasn&#x27;t gonna use Win11 anyways so I just booted up Ventoy and a fresh Win10 image straight from Microsoft.com (via their tool to make bootable USB/download ISO).
 I delete all the old system partitions with that iso and pick that internal NVMe disk to install Windows 10 on, it reboots, I pick language and keyboard layout, and it then configures for a while before it shows a different (more blue&#x27;er than Win11) login screen with the name of the same company (at this point I hadn&#x27;t even realized that the company name was a com…</span>

                              <span>Hey guys, I had a debate with my cybersecurity expert recently about updating one of our software. 
 We use GLPI (ITSM software) and it recently got an update with some security fix, while I&#x27;m aware we do need to do it at some point. My CS colleague and I were arguing about when to do it. I would much better prefer to wait until all our 10 used add-on are tested then updated (that may or may not take a while) while he would test and get rid of the un-updated add-on or if not possible use another soft which have the feature we need without needing to use third party add-on which are prone to not get updated as often. We are pretty early in our deployment so it still make more or less sense to change software. 
 I get his point which is that it&#x27;s absolutely terrible not to correct a known cybersecurity risk for some feature but these feature are all needed for our use case and I know that updating when using multiples add-on can get messy quickly. We didn&#x27;t setup a test environment yet, we plan to set it up as fast as possible to see if these feature do break. What seems clear to me is that the same issue will arise for each of our app later down the road. 
 How do you guys tackle updating software in your company especially when certains third party features might break, do you simply get rid of it ? Do you develop yourself these features so that maintaining it is less an issue ? Would you use a software that would support theses features natively (if it exist) ?

 Anyone know of a good IT asset inventory / asset management tool that might work for us? We are looking to gather info such as make, model, software installed incl. versions.
 Including mobile devices / BYOD.
 We already use InTune, so thinking maybe we could utilize that inventory &amp;/or pipe into the asset inventory tool.
 We want to utilize the asset inventory to improve our IT and Security functions (mainly to streamline processes such as vuln. management, patching, software licensing oversight)
 Any guidance would be appreciated ! Thank you.

                              <span>I FINALLY have an opportunity to be fast tracked and interviewed for a Google sysadmin for the DOD. I have two interviews set up next week with the HM meeting sometime shortly thereafter. 
 I am from the government sector but on the county level onsite. This position would be remote and they would sponsor a top secret clearance YAY! I heard it could take some time to get everything in order, so what should I expect? When should I tell me other job? When should I expect my equipment? When should I expect my first paycheck? 
 I heard the work life balance is great and in general it looks like the sysadmins I know that work for my county do the bare minimum of their contract in order to satisfy the requirements of butts in the seat. They don&#x27;t get micro managed and if something doesn&#x27;t work, they don&#x27;t know how to fix they generally just sit on their hands until it can get fixed. 
 I also would like to move up from sysadmin to cybersecurity at one point maybe working with the same company. Any other insights or tips would be greatly appreciated :)

                              <span>Hello Experts -
 A leased line connects my Branch office and my DC. The branch office needs to connect to a Web server in my DC.
 Design Question: Do I still need to set up a DMZ and put my Web server there to protect my infrastructure?

                              <span>Hi Fellow sys admins, 
 I was curious to see what type of recommendations you have for securitywhile setting up a new Microsoft 365 enviorment for a Enterprise ( arroud 20 office staff, and about 100ish remote / site based employees ). The I.T show is mainly a one man show, with a a couple L1 Helpdesk employees. 
 FYI : I have approval for Microsoft E3 plans for every user which includes Azure P1
 What security defaults would you reccoment to tweak to maximize security and accesibility in the transition, from local stoarge, imap for email, and 3cx for calling and a local DC to 100% cloud based ( sharepoint, teams, exhchange, intune etc ). 
 I have previous experience in low level managment of these systems but not really sure about how to lock down these systems for security and a smooth transition/rollout.
 Thanks in Advance!

                              <span>Anyone using Azure Arc and new update management center to patch server VMs? Looks like a great tool. I seen this discussion about the implementation. But, I don&#x27;t want to manage/rely on WSUS (it is a mess).
  
How do you add newly added Arc enabled servers to periodic assessment automatically. Using policy definitions? Trying to implement automation here. I know you can manually select each machines and enable periodic assessment.
 How to patch servers in batch to avoid outage? Create a dynamic group using tags or resource group and attach a maintenance schedule to this group? (Say for example group servers as three batches and tag them based on their groups. servers will be added to groups based on tags and each group have it&#x27;s own maintenance schedule. Maybe fist batch get update on week 1 and second batch get update on week 2 and third batch of mission critical servers get patched quarterly).

                              <span>My wife is in the process of setting up a small business with 3 staff. Herself plus 2 volunteers and has asked me to recommend a platform for email, communication and file storage / sharing. They all work remotely and use a mix of Windows laptops and Macs and will have around 50GB of data that will need to accessed by all 3. Besides the 3 email accounts they will need 1 shared calendar to begin and a shared notes section. My wife would also like to be able to restrict access to files and folders if needed particularly when the business grows. 
 I’ve never recommended a solution to anyone before - I’ve administered both though. So I’m at a bit of a loss as to which one to recommend.

                              <span>I install systems for old people, so I make everything as streamlined and non-intrusive as possible.
 It already is annoying enough to make everything shut up so I don&#x27;t get called 50 times to ask what button they have to press now, I disable everything that can give pop-ups or notifications.
 And now there&#x27;s this. A Bing popup in Windows, to ask for integration in fucking Chrome, with everything turned off both in browsers and windows itself... 
 1) how fucking desperate are they?
 2) how do I kill this in the registry or with CMD so I can add it to my ”stop windows bitching&quot; script?
 The source is &quot;bgaupsell.exe&quot; in the temp folder.
 Thanks in advance!

When ever we assign a user a laptop we first update a google sheet with the laptop ID and then log into Active directory to manually add the user to the appropriate domain for network access and add the laptop ID to user account. Is there a way to automate these steps ?? Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I have been working with a specific person at a vendor for 4 years. We have spent a decent amount well over 200k. When our latest server upgrade came into play we did the usual and got multiple quotes and went with a new reseller because they gave us a steep discount for us using other services of theirs. When I informed the rep we were using a different vendor for this purchase I was told that I would be reassigned to a new account manager because of this. Anyone else have anything odd like this??

                              <span>But it&#x27;s installed on Win 11 Home and while a migration to a Win 11 Pro machine is possible, it&#x27;d a bit of an effort. Before I go Pro, is it worth it? Are alternatives like a free AnyViewer license not better anyway? My reqs:
  
The app specs says it can&#x27;t be run as an remote app, whatever that means
 I need to access the app over the Internet ofc; I&#x27;ve heard that RDP can be insecure and needs extra config like a VPN and/or some gateway thing
 I&#x27;d like to keep administrating that access to a minimum since I don&#x27;t know anything about Win server admin (but Linux)

                              <span>For Windows Server 2016 RDS Session hosts, is there any way to visually show the encryption type the client connected using? It will either be TLS or &quot;native&quot; RDP. I&#x27;m aware of the various ways to enumerate the active sessions (e.g. Qwinsta), but not with this piece of information.

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m looking for suggestions on a dual sim vehicle modem. I have Verizon and AT&amp;T hotspot plans. Currently, I use my Verizon in a cradlepoint in my truck and the AT&amp;T in its OG Franklin A50 configuration. I&#x27;d like to have both sims in one device in my truck...using the best signal as what gets served to the WIFI network. Does anyone have any good suggestions for hardware for this setup? Thank you!

                              <span>So we are moving to the office of our parent company soon and I got the opportunity to redo the entire network stack there since the current setup has a lot of issues and I am looking into what kind of hardware I should be getting. 
 Currently their network consists out of 9 Unifi switches, a unifi security gateway and 12 Ubiquiti UAP-AC-Pro access points for roughly 100-150 clients and they are having wifi drops constantly. I am guessing that the current APs simply can&#x27;t handle the density and having all settings set to auto won&#x27;t help either. 
 The office doesn&#x27;t need much in terms of complexity, there will be 2 different networks, one whi h does basic internet access and the other connects to a more restricted network. For now they&#x27;ll get seperate SSIDs, but eventually we&#x27;ll be moving it to a RADIUS assigned VLAN setup. 
 So currently I am looking into another Ubiquiti unifi setup since it has served me well personally, and I do like the centralized management interface. But I want to make sure I am making the best choice here. Preferably I like to keep the single pane of glass interface for switches and wifi, but it&#x27;s not required. I do need switches which do POE+ and can aggregate to a central 10g switch for distribution since we have a high bandwidth backup server. 
 What kind of setup would you guys go with? Any recommendations?

                              <span>We have some equipment such as a time clock, laser, printers, NAS, etc with web pages that are useful for viewing the machine&#x27;s job statuses and starting/pausing/stopping them. However, IP addresses tend to change with DHCP (especially for machines that get turned off when not in use) so it makes it a pain to find and access them. Fixed IP addresses may be possible but would be difficult. Is it possible to open a webpage by mac address instead of IP? It would be awesome to just be able to bookmark a specially formatted URL or something that won&#x27;t change with DHCP. It gets more complicated as we add more machinery.

                              <span>Hi all,
 We need to test an 80KM length of dark fiber, and I had a couple of questions about accurate testing. We need to make sure our length test is within 1KM as we need this data to choose what dispersion compensation module we need.
 We have an OTDR but really the main question I have - which seems to have very fuzzy answers out there - is what length launch cable I need for testing an 80KM span. I get answers like “1000M, 2000M or maybe 4000M” - but no good way to calculate it, except by using pulse width, but even that isn’t clear on what the best pulse width should be.
 Any tips on the following would be appreciated:
 launch cable length? do I really need a receive cable, and if so, what length? pulse width settings? We have an auto-mode but would like some discussion of the best settings here Thanks in advance for any help!
 T.

                              <span>I started using a UniFi 16 lite switch on a network run by a Synology router. Per Synology’s Threat Prevention Software, my switch is getting 99% of potential attacks/threat from the internet- roughly 9000 events with about 15 High-Severity ones. These are mostly targeting ET Exploit Realtek SDK with attempting to gain admin privileges. 
 How normal are these? Is this something to worry about? Also why is basically only this switch getting so many attempts and not any other device? The Switch firmware is up to date.

                              <span>I&#x27;m looking to hear from anyone who is either part of an organization or knows someone in an organization(likely an ISP or a utility cooperative) that will be receiving grant money from programs like RDOF, ARPA or BEAD. To drill down into what I&#x27;m really looking to see is if IT teams will use this windfall of funding to change the architecture of their network from the known &quot;big box&quot; players to a more nimble and economically viable approach such as Disaggregated White Box Networking. 
 I&#x27;ve had more conversations with Network Managers or equivilent over the past 15 years and the one thing I&#x27;ve probably heard the most was they will drop Cisco the moment they are able. This is obviously easier said than done. For networking professionals I&#x27;ve spoken to in the service provider space I&#x27;ve heard the same sentiment with Juniper often replacing Cisco as the big bad.
 I don&#x27;t want to know the name of your company, just curious if there is any talk of either going Whitebox for the additonal buildout of the network or even a plan to completely rip out Cisco or Juniper in a lattered approach over the next 3-5 years as an example.

 thanks!

 Hoping someone here can shed some light on this for me! At work we use a Sky Fibre (FTTC) and we have their AudioCodes box which hasn&#x27;t worked for over 6 months.
 After tonnes of messages with Sky they&#x27;ve finally told me the reason it&#x27;s not working is because our CCTV system is using IPV6 (mesh connection) which is interfering with the connection between the Sky Hub and the Audio Codes box.
 The CCTV system we use is a Annke CCTV which is plugged in via ethernet and the cameras are hard wired, i&#x27;ve checked the settings and it does show a IPV6 address (as well as IPV4).
 Could I simply remove the IPV6 settings and save the settings and then this should only use the IPV4 address? Or would anyone else reccomend any alterantive ways of doing this? (Link to settings screenshot: https…</span>

                              <span>I’ve posted about this before, but I’m back with more answers but still no resolution. Long story short, Apple devices spoof their MAC by default. Each time the client roams from one WAP to the next (even under the same SSID) the mac address changes. In theory, this sounds great! 
 Here’s my problem, each time the MAC address changes a new DHCP request is sent. At smaller facilities this typically doesn’t cause much issue. However, at our larger facilities this is causing our DHCP pool to run out of IPs. 
 In an attempt to free up IP space, I’ve turned the DHCP lease time down to 1 minute and increased that network to a /22. On average, this network has around 150 users, at its busiest around 200. My attempt to relieve the issue worked for about 2 hours, then the DHCP pool was full again. 
 Think about it this way, if 1 person walks across the facility and passes 10 WAPs with their phone in their pocket, they’ve just leased 10 different IPs. Now imagine 150 people constantly running around a hospital. 
 I’ve been racking my brain over this for months, and without implementing an MDM I don’t think there’s much we can do. Thoughts? Suggestions? Anybody else ever run into this issue?

                              <span>Hi guys,
 I&#x27;m trying to find a way to filter out specific RADIUS attribute in authentication and accounting messages from NAD (IOS XE) to RADIUS Server (ISE).
 I&#x27;d like to reduce the unnecessary overhead caused by Framed IPv6 address attribute which is getting snooped from client devices.
 I don&#x27;t want to disable IPv6 on the client devices but after integrating ISE API with 3rd party firewalls, I&#x27;m seeing v6 Link Local addresses there which are not useful in our enviroment.
 I&#x27;ve managed to sort this out on switches by tweaking Device Tracking policy but I also want to get rid of these addresses on our Catalyst WLC (IOS XE).
 The WLC is centrally authenticating clients to RADIUS server.
 I read a bit about RADIUS attribute lists and I thought I could use that but I didn&#x27;t succeed.
 Did anyone of you try to deal with it this way?

 Happens for about 5-6 minutes and then usually clears up. What&#x27;s also weird is that explorer tends to take up just a portion of the screen until it clears up where it expands back to full size.

                              <span>So, I was laid off 3 weeks ago or so. After a slow start to the process, finally had a few interviews today.
 I was....taken aback at a job requirement, not in the job description, that was dropped in the interview. Now, in the job requirements, it DID says, &quot;Has to be OK working PST hours&quot;. I am on the east coast. I mentioned it to the recruiter, he said as long as it mostly overlapped it wouldn&#x27;t be a big deal. 
 After rapid firing me through....7 or 8 different tech stacks, the interviewer (my potential future boss), asked about how I did standup previously. 
 I told him we had a standup, typically in the morning. 
 He said &quot;Well, we have a daily standup, but since 4 of our members are in India, it&#x27;s at 9 AM India time and its required every day, would this be a problem?&quot;
 (I originally thought it was 9:30 EST, i was mistaken, it&#x27;s 11:30 PM EST). I said I&#x27;d have to think about it. I mentioned I have no issue doing an asynchronous standup and he was adamant that it was a requirement. I repeated that I would have to think about it. 
 This isn&#x27;t something common right? I certainly get with distributed work force there can be some odd hours, but requiring a daily standup EITHER part of the world where one has to be up at 11 PM local time is unreasonable. has anyone seen this or had to do this as part of their job? I&#x27;m withdrawing my name from consideration for the role, I am just curious if others have seen this.

Even when I go out camping for the weekend I come back to messages of horror form my co workers. It&#x27;s also coincidence that someone else is also out sick at the same time. RIP weekend plans.

                              <span>How do you not overspend on licenses? I’m debating what metrics to suggest to my director since we’re deciding for the new license year Oct 1. Me: 40k employees with a mix of retail, home office, distro center, etc. 
 I’m thinking :
 1)employee hasn’t logged in in 6 months and we have a 90day retention policy, then they don’t need an E5 license, or if they’re not issued a computer (truck driver, welder, etc a person that at most sends an email but doesn’t touch excel) then F license. 
 2) Employee has both an E5 &amp; and E3, then something is wrong and they don’t need both.
 3) Service accounts not sign in’ing in 6 months, needs a review. 
 4) Conference room, licensed for Teams Premium or another license type that costs, if not used, in 3 months, needs a review .

                              <span>Just curious as to which operating system you use on your main rig and why? 
 Personally I run Linux and have been very happy with the experience. I made the switch because Windows was starting to feel like a big, heavy piece of adware and privacy was becoming a concern of mine. I like that Linux also runs like butter on lower end systems that Windows just doesn’t support anymore (less e-waste).

                              <span>Whenever I log into a Windows machine I get the message &quot;could not reconnect all network drives&quot; and I am tearing my hair out trying to work out where this is coming from, i.e. what drives are not able to be mapped and where that mapping is coming from.
 When this happens and I go into explorer there are no drives with the little x on them to indicate that they are not reconnected, and all the mapped drives (2 of them, from a login script) are mapped fine.
 I just went through all of my GPOs to see if I can find some indication in there as to what is going on, but there are no drive mapping settings anywhere in my GPOs.
 I searched the Windows logs to see if I could find more details on this, but I cannot find anything.
 And lastly, I do have the &quot;wait for network connection&quot; option set in my GPOs, so it&#x27;s not that.
 Since this happens on every windows machine I log into, the mappings have to be coming from somewhere in AD, but I cannot find it.
 Any suggestions on how I can work out what drives are being mapped so I can kill this message?
 EDIT: Thanks to /u/bigtime618 who was spot on in identifying the issue. My login script maps a share with different credentials from that of my user account, and this is what caused the issue. To fix it I just needed to add /persistent:no to my net use command in my login script.

 How were you able to do that and did you lose functionality?
 Does using Windows Admin Center help with this or not?

                              <span>I manage a company with about 150 users. My server room had a window mount A/C unit until last year when I finally made the call to replace it with a mini-split. I use Cisco Small business switches because I&#x27;m not paying more than $700 for an access layer switch. I had to fight to get us moved over to M365, instead of just letting everyone use their personal Gmail address for company email. Every laptop across the whole company is refurbished.
 I&#x27;m my own boss. The only person I report to is the CEO, and he lets me run things. I feel great about what I do. My SMB makes things that people need, and I help make that possible. I am well respected by everyone I work with. I&#x27;m paid enough to live comfortably, and I get to go to all my kid&#x27;s school events. My work-related-stress is easily manageable. I have very little interest in working for a large entity, though admittedly I don&#x27;t know what it&#x27;s like to be part of a large enterprise team. I suspect that in some ways it&#x27;s different and some ways the same. There are probably great enterprises to work for just like there are great SMBs, and terrible ones. I think my setup is preferable, but I can understand why someone would want a more sophisticated environment.
 I&#x27;m really tired of seeing derision and disrespect lobbed from one side of this divide towards the other here on /r/sysadmin. I have been guilty of it myself, but no more. I promise from now on to stop and think before I fire off an angry reply. The sysadmin on the other end of the comment may have a totally different perspective on the issue, but they are still my brother or sister in arms.
 Thanks for reading.
 TLDR: Be nice, your department&#x27;s budget doesn&#x27;t define your worth as a SysAdmin.

 We are running EXO o365 for our business email and have been getting nailed repeatedly with a phishing email that we are struggling to block.
 Everything about it is dynamic
 Sender name changes everytime
 Sender email changes everytime
 Subject changes everytime
 The entire content of the email is an image which has a malicious hyperlink. No text in he body
 The sending IP changes everytime
 There is not much to create a rule to block this on…

                              <span>My wife read me an email she was sending and as I was thinking about it and offering her advice on her phrasing I realized that, likely due to working in IT, when I construct an email or I’m speaking to someone outside of my IT circle I often use passive voice to soften the blow of what I’m saying. 
 Since I’m often dealing with problems, most of the time committed by users, to prevent sounding overly critical and not making the individual feel stupid I structure my sentences to add emphasis on the object and what happened to the object rather than the user (subject) or just omit the subject entirely. 
 Example: The keyboard wasn’t plugged in. 
 I could easily blame the user for not plugging in the keyboard by adding them to the sentence, but I don’t. 
 I’m curious if anyone else speaks like this.

 We have a hundred support boxes but usually the reps adjust the from field to be the main customer support box, I am being asked to come up witha solution to this other than having the customers just email the main support box instead of the hundred different ones.
 I really don&#x27;t know how to solve it on the 365 end via spoofing or what not.

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m working up DR/BC plans, and wondering how to approach this scenario. I&#x27;ve heard of a company&#x27;s entire Azure tenant getting corrupted, or somehow becoming inaccessible for a long time. We&#x27;ve got a hybrid AD, in an Azure VM-Windows Server. We keep files in a server share, as well as in like 50 different Teams/SP libraries. 
 I back up our server shares externally to an AWS bucket, in addition to Azure&#x27;s built-in backup. I run test file restores once a month. We use Afi to backup mailboxes, Onedrives and Teams/Libraries. But the only backups of our AD are stored in Azure&#x27;s backup; I&#x27;ve never tried to restore it. 
 Should we consider what happens if our whole Azure/MS365 tenant goes sour? Do companies keep an alternate domain? Testing the viability of restoring AD and Teams to it? Should we have a plan in case Microsoft goes south altogether? 
 Also, we&#x27;re supposed to do vulnerability scans and network penetration testing, for our insurance policy. Should I be outsourcing DR planning and testing, along with scanning and pen testing? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Not too worried about the loss of redundancy, it&#x27;s a backup server, if it ever went live, it wouldn&#x27;t be for long, just need more storage on it, for now. I can actually, via OpenManage, reconfigure from RAID5 to RAID0, and increase the size of the RAID array by almost a couple TBs, but it doesn&#x27;t say anything if the data in the RAID array will be lost. The RAID array contains the current backup files.
 TLDR; does anyone know if running the &quot;reconfigure&quot; RAID array wizard using OpenManage on a T620, PERC H310 going from RAID5 to RAID0 would cause data loss on the array, or keep the data intact?

                              <span>Happy Friday
 Where are you folks buying S/MIME Certificates for your employees? I&#x27;m currently using Sectigo.com but each employee is having to create their own account to order it &amp; we&#x27;re having to put the company credit card on each employees account. There doesn&#x27;t seem to be a way to centrally manage it. Is there a better service where we can order certificates for employees while being able to centrally manage them, see expiration dates, etc? 
 Muchas Gracias

                              <span>Hi all. Throwaway. The organization I work for is trying to restructure IT so that work is escalated more appropriately. Right now it&#x27;s pretty devil may care but they want/need a more corporate and policy based support structure. We have about 1000 users, about 300 admin.
 Currently, Service Desk kind of handles everything that isn&#x27;t on a server (and a good bit of server stuff too). My boss and I have talked about a new &quot;T2/3&quot; position that I could take on. The idea here is that Service Desk would be responsible for being T1 and then anything they couldn&#x27;t figure out or the refining of processes would be escalated to T2. That team would be me and then possibly 2 contractors below me.
 On top of T2 support, the stuff I&#x27;d be doing day to day would include:
 PBX System Support/admin

 Shopping around for a new RMM. We currently use Action1 because the 100 count free, but I do feel it&#x27;s somewhat lacking.
 Curious what some of you would recommend for a very small IT team that manages about 65 workstations and 20 servers/devices.
 Ive looked into ninjaOne but I&#x27;m scared that price tag is going to be nuts.

Thanks to you all, whenever I feel those ways your posts keep me motivated. I’m still not sure what I want to do and doubt myself daily but just having a community where I can get helpful insights and feel like I can relate helps me so much.
 Please continue to posts and comment, I don’t comment munch or like but I read a lot of comments and posts. I hope to be as technical as you all.
 You guys have saved my life truly.
 Thank you

 I’m thinking of starting with the AZ900 to get the fundamentals down and then look at AZ104. 
 What books do you recommend? I know Microsoft has their study guide online, but I prefer something physical.

 The script would have to be able to determine which group the user is currently in is the department security group , remove them from it, then add them to their new department security group.
 Ideally the script/tool is easy enough that a non IT person can use that way I can eventually push this task onto HR since they&#x27;re the ones generating these movement lists.

                              <span>I learned that the hardware requirements for Windows 11 can effectively be skipped using the Rufus tool. Is this something we only do at home in a pinch, or would you be ok doing it in the workplace as well if, for example, we have a bunch of systems in deployment with useful life left on them? 
 Assume the benefits of TPM 2.0 aren’t critical to us.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a really weird issue popping up with a user&#x27;s Adobe Acrobat 2020. When he works remotely, it opens their large PDF&#x27;s without any issue and does not go non responsive and isn&#x27;t slow.
 When working locally? the program goes non responsive every 2-3 pages, opens slow, generally unusable.
 I&#x27;ve followed a few different forums about this but honestly it seems like a pretty unique problem, has anyone encountered this? If not what should I do, wipe and reload the machine? I&#x27;m kinda stuck here

                              <span>Hi everyone. I am trying to backup data from a clients PC and he has hunderds of files with file path name that is too long for 256 character limit.
 I tried backing it all up with total commander, but it gives me the same message, saying that the file name path is too long.
 I think there is an option for it, but I haven&#x27;t found it after one hour.
 Could someone kindly assist me with this issue?
 Is there an option in total commander that enables copying files that are over limit?
 Is there any other software that you would reccomend me?
 ​
 I heard that Robocop is good for that, I found some GUI version and will try to back it up that way. I am still not sure if there are some parameters that need to be configured in order to copy long files. I thought that it is integrated by default in Total Commander?

Today when I try, the centos image boots over the network and stops halfway saying network unreachable. I am unable to ping the pc from teh dhcp server either.
 I do not understand how this could happen. I tried changing the hardware, connections etc. There is no firewall running on the dhcp server either. Would any of you have any idea why this could be?

There&#x27;s also a great deal of content out there that violates our advertising/promotion rule, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos.
 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

 Use case: When others send you a URL (on Slack or promotion emails)
 The old way to check the safety of the URL you received is: click it, or copy &amp; paste it to the checker
 The new way: you can see if it&#x27;s safe right after you received it.
 Really need your feedback on it, thanks a ton!

                              <span>Sys Admins, 
 Looking for the best system or method for employees to state they are working remotely of in the office. We are currently reviewing or fire safety proceures and one major item is determining who is in the building and being able to produce an employee checklist. 
 We have a door system, however 
  
it does not track outoging staff
 Tailgating is a big issue. 
  
We are a heavy office 365 enviornment, so it would be beneficial to integrate for ease into 365. 
 ​
 Was initially thinking an office 365 clock in system that simply requests are you remote working or office working. Allowing staff to switch to remote if they leaving for meetings during the day. currently the line of thinking is a simple power app that will produce a 30 day log. 
 ​
 Note; we are not looking to track employee productivity, soley if they are in the physical building or not.

                              <span>We just upgraded from 2012 to 2019. We&#x27;re not allowed to run TLS1.0 due to security concerns.
 So when we set up remote desktop without it, we get the old familiar problem from 2012 &amp; 2016 that when we try to start the RDMS, it immediately stops again, just like with https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/remote/rds-connection-broker-or-rdms-fails-caused-by-disabled-tls-10 - only that article says the fix is to upgrade to 2019 like we did.
 If we try to run without connection broker, we get &quot;cannot connect to any of the specified RD Connection Broker servers. Ensure that at least one server is available...&quot;
 Anyone have this issue?

                              <span>We have a shared mailbox which, when it receives an email from a user, delivers an auto response... to itself and not the user? 
 The mailbox is used for company suggestions from staff, so the reply is as you&#x27;d expect, &#x27;thanks for your idea blah blah&#x27;, but it appears as an email/notification from &quot;Microsoft Outlook postmaster@company.onmicrosoft.com&quot;, and as I said, in its own inbox.
 The problem isn&#x27;t necessarily that the user isn&#x27;t getting the message, because we want to change it anyway; the problem is that I have no idea where this message is coming from. As it&#x27;s a shared mailbox you cannot log into it so auto replies weren&#x27;t set up this way. Using the Exchange Admin Center also shows that there is no auto-reply set up, and I&#x27;ve tried using the Exchange PowerShell module to Get-InboxRules, of which there are none. 
 Is there anything I&#x27;m missing, as I can&#x27;t think of anywhere else to check where this reply is stored and why it&#x27;s being sent?
 ​
 Thanks for your help!

 Anyone tried applying the Secure Boot DBX update for UEFI using the SplitDbxContent.ps1 script?

                              <span>So in my company we started enabling BitLocker. Now when that is set up, how exactly does it work? Please help me understand. Every user has a windows log in password. So, if that user wants to use their laptop, they just have to enter their windows log in password. Where does bit locker come in handy then? (ofcourse if they &quot;guess&quot; your windows log in password correctly, they are in your laptop and there&#x27;s nothing you can do about it?) In the case if someone steals your laptop, they will need your windows login password which they won&#x27;t have right? So you&#x27;re covered there. After that, if they take the disk out and plug it in anywhere else, they will need a recovery key that you extracted to an external disk when setting up bitlocker?
 ​
 Is that all there is to it?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello,
 iam searching a solution for the following workflow.
 Our Monitoring-System is sending an alert via E-Mail.
 Jira is creating a Ticket for the alert and is sending a notification/invitation to the worker who has shift - jira should getting the information, who has the shift, from a calander.
 If the shift does not respond to the Ticket/Alert in a specific time the next person in shift is getting the information. 
 Is there a free or self-hosted solution?
 I think GoAlert is going into this direction. 
 Our Monitoring-System is Intermapper and our E-Mail-Server Kerio with CAL-Dev.
 ​
 Thank you for your support.

 Both connectors have spf+ modules, but operate in different fixed modes, as configured from the switch, server network adapter themselves.
 According to my understanding the possible damage extent is from SFP module to SFP module and the switch and network adapter will not be damaged, however a clarification is needed.

                              <span>Hi having issues with shared inboxes in office 365 using outlook
 We&#x27;ve got multiple shared inboxes and usually 6 or 7 people using it
 The users normal inbox is working fine the issue is the shared inboxes are slow and freezing in outlook for multiple users The shared inboxes aren&#x27;t that large usually 2-3GB 
 32 or 64 bit office doesn&#x27;t seem to make a difference one thing that helped for a while was turning off download shared folders and turning off shared calendar improvements 
 Only thing that works well is using OWA the shared mailbox is responsive
 Has anyone had this issue and know a fix that improved the performance of it?

 It will be used for a remote agro business with 4G cell &amp; satellite, and they are trying to bond the links together.
 Are there any F/OSS software that provides link aggregation on generic intel hw? We started exploring VyOS, and so far it is promising.
 Thank you.

                              <span>Hi!
 I am on the beginning on my network journey and would appreciate some advice regarding VLANs.
 I am mostly surrounded by TP-Link, Unifi, and other low end devices, and often time they are geared towards SOHO use, but hey... it is what it is. 
 I plan the VLANs, what endpoint goes where, but my mind stops working when I am given a SOHO switch which can separate VLANS,i can set wich port is trunk, wich port is a member of a specific VLAN... 
 However when it comes to setting it&#x27;s own management IP address, I can not set a VLAN. So that device is reachable from all VLANs knowing it&#x27;s IP address, or you have to allow untagged packets on the entirity of the network and call the untagged network the management network?
 ​
 What is the best practice for dealing with low-end switches if you want to separate the production traffic from the management traffic?

                              <span>So we introduced a new core stack at our HQ, which was necessary at the time because our new storage needed 10gb networking. 
  
Current core sw IP is 10.177.1.10 on the &quot;switch mgmnt vlan&quot;, the new stack is 10.177.1.40 on the &quot;switch mgmnt vlan&quot;.
 The new stack has a etherchannel trunk to the current core.
 The new stack&#x27;s default route is ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.177.1.10
 At that time we were not ready to retire the old sw that is the current core, and it handles all the routing. 
 We now want to retire the old core sw, and do all the routing on this new stack.
  
I know I need to create the svi&#x27;s on the new core stack (leaving them shutdown till cutover) and any ACL&#x27;s and ip routes and vlans. And move the last remaining cables plugged into it to the new cores.
 All other switches in the building (about 35 of them) have 10.177.1.10 as their default route currently.
 What&#x27;s the best practice to get all those sw&#x27;s pointing at the new core sw stack instead of the old?
 Or is it as simple as changing the new core stack mngmnt IP to 10.177.1.10?

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on an assignment for my Distributed Systems class as part of my CS undergrad, and I need to generate a simulation that demonstrates the differences in efficiency between cloud computing vs edge computing.
 I want this sim to give evidence of the reduction in latency and overall bandwidth that the edge approach provides for one specific context, however I don&#x27;t really know the best context is to demonstrate this (online information about edge networks seems to bring up self driving cars a lot).
 Another problem is I have absolutely no idea what software I should use, I found a resource with links to a bunch of simulators specifically focused on edge computing networks, but they seem quite obtuse (especially to someone who has a quite basic understanding of networking).
 Is there some kind of &quot;network simulator for dummies&quot; that lets you put together a topology graphically?
 I will admit I am painfully naive to the complexity of this task, and the resources provided to me by my University aren&#x27;t helpful. Any advice you can give as to what software to use, and where to learn how to use it is much appreciated.

 I&#x27;m not a common redditor so if I do anything here thats not cool please correct me immediately.
 I have a CCNA and a CASP. CCNA expires end of this month so I&#x27;m starting the CE work. Does anyone have any advice for what to use? Last time I used a 60 hour course for the CCNP but I can&#x27;t remember where it was from. I&#x27;m hoping to find one that will cover both the CASP and CCNA CE so I can optimize my time.
 I work for the DOD and have 10 years in the game. Bachelors in theatre and bartender for 10 years before that. I just like to subnet I guess.
 Thanks in advance!

 Right now we just use a customized HTML page uploaded to our Cisco WLC where users accept a disclaimer and they are on. Business wants to move to a portal that requires various login options such as socials, SMS code, form with email validation, or a voucher code.

                              <span>A few years ago I saw a great youtube discussion between David Bombal and Hank Preston about this Cisco live devnet presentation (pdf-link) on network automation. (I didn&#x27;t see the actual cisco live presentation, but I found out about it later through Bombal)
 I find the concept of the toolbox with different drawers (use-cases) really useful. There are so many tools out there that can be used for network automation at various points in the network life-cycle that it&#x27;s a bit overwhelming when you&#x27;re trying to evaluate possible solutions.
 The problem is that this presentation is several years old now and I was wondering if anyone has something similar that&#x27;s more up-to-date? Has anyone recently gone through the effort of categorizing some of the tools that are now out there and their various applications? If so, anyone willing to share their notes?
 I&#x27;m trying to evaluate what automation tools I could bring to my environment and which ones might be good candidates for various use-cases.

                              <span>Hi Everyone! I am Equity analyst doing a project on the public networking companies. I have been trying to understand why Arista has been so successful in gaining market share in 400G DC switches. Everyone prescribes it to their software, ie EOS? Would you agree?
 How would you characterise their advantage to the man on the street?
 Looking forward to hear your opinion and if you agree!

                              <span>For some years we&#x27;ve been using a well-known web filtering provider, but are considering alternatives due to poor support, design decisions they&#x27;ve made with their latest platform and decreasing product quality in the platform we&#x27;re using.
 Currently we use an endpoint-based filtering solution where traffic is either:
  
Steered to a proxy server running on the endpoint itself (via PAC file)
 Transparently intercepted by a Windows Filtering Platform driver
  
The endpoint makes policy decisions and the traffic is sent to its destination directly. Our requirements (at a very high level) have been to:
  
Block inappropriate categories
 Block security risks based on category
 Provide real-time assessment for potential security risks (e.g. compromised sites hosting phishing pages)
  
We&#x27;ve spoken vendors with varying offerings:
  
Baracuda
 Censornet
 Cloudflare
 Menlo
 Netskope
 Skyhigh
 ZScaler
  
The majority of these vendors take a different approach, where traffic is routed through a transparent proxy via ipsec/gre tunnel. I&#x27;m a little wary of this approach from a performance perspective. I understand the various vendors arguments in terms of better peering etc, but wary of further complexity in troubleshooting performance issues for our service desk team (which we don&#x27;t really have with the incumbent).
 We have a decent remote-access VPN solution and no immediate desire to do anything with it.
 Does anyone have any vendors they can recommend that offer endpoint-based solutions, or vendors to avoid if we do go down the tunnel route? TIA.

 My question is why use wildcard opposed to subnet mask.

                              <span>Is there any CISCO ISE experts in here ? 
 I with Intune deploy a Device certificate to an Android device for a 802.1x wifi. The certificate is on the device and also the wifi profile. Everytime I try to connect it just write &quot;authentication error&quot; 
 But if checking the device mac address in Ise, there is nothing (and yes mac Randomisation is disabled), so there is no loggin information on what goes wrong. I have exacts same policies setup for IOS devices in Intune where it works well. If having the device mac address, shouldn´t it be possible somehow in ISE to look up what is going on ?

                              <span>Currently in my company, we&#x27;re using VPN-&gt;Then RDP. And inside RDP, we access remote server. While some servers/databases are directly accessible, some are not. We need to do tunneling for it. I&#x27;m failing to understand the point of tunneling. I&#x27;ve read articles after articles like this(https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/virtualpg/wiki?name&#x3D;port-forwarding), but it&#x27;s not entering my head. Can&#x27;t anyone who knows the server IP and has company VPN; tunnel and get access to that server? I know they can, but what&#x27;s the point of that tunnel? They could&#x27;ve just filtered by requests coming via a particular IP say xx.xx.xx.xx to be allowed and reject everything else. What&#x27;s the point of tunneling?
 What&#x27;s the problem that tunneling is trying to solve?

                              <span>Hi guys.I have the following problem to solve:&gt; in my office the PC are connected only via ethernet to a private network; no other connection to the global Internet.&gt; some employees from the headquarters, who come to our office once/twice a week, want a wifi connection (instead of using their phone). They can use the private network or the global internet.&gt; My office is a very long building, with stone walls.&gt; I was asked to find an inexpensive solution.I had two ideas:OPTION 1) use a 4G/4G+ router with a SIM, to give connection to the 1 or 2 rooms (stone walls) that have decent 4G signal and ask the employees to move there for connection;OPTION 2) use some USB 4G Modem Dongle. I would buy 2 or 3 and give them to the users that are in the building.I excluded creating a wifi with WAPs; it seems expensive and there&#x27;s the security server to manage (here we don&#x27;t even have a Windows Domain).Give me your opinions/suggestions please. thx

                              <span>Hey guys, dont kill me for asking this if it sounds too basic but my gut is telling me one thing and I&#x27;m getting a lot of pushback.
 I&#x27;m not far into my career, but I&#x27;m contracting for a client and they have an environment that is public cloud based, and I&#x27;m evaluating the need for engineers to VPN in to utilize the features, like decryption and content filtering, on our enterprise firewall to harden our security stance while working on public cloud resources. Unfortunately we use a firewall which requires licenses for VPN connections.
 Is my thinking wrong here? Is there really no need for remote users to use any kind of VPN when performing their job function?
 The first thing my mind goes to is a MOTM attack on some shitty insecure coffee shop wifi, or poor browsing habits leading to someone&#x27;s device being compromised. No one seems to be considering this. Is there really no need to have any kind of VPN if defender is installed? They may be using an Azure client VPN, but no mention has been made of this.
 Thanks very much

                              <span>Is there a simple usb-powered 3-port gigabit switch, or a USB network adapter with integrated 2-port switch?
 Background…
 In my work, I visit multiple sites with my laptop, and connect into our corporate network. Unfortunately some of the sites I visit don’t have a spare network port in the office for me to connect to. 
 My current solution is to carry a 5-port Ethernet switch, and jump-in between one of the existing computers - connecting the switch to the wall outlet, and the existing computer and my laptop to the switch. It works well. However, a 5-port switch is bulky, it also has a wall-wart, which I need to plug in, many sites don’t have a spare power port either, so I carry a power-board which I put between the existing power and one of their devices… yes everything works, but it is a lot of equipment to carry around, and since I will usually only be at the site for a day, it is a pain unpacking and packing up etc.
 If there was a USB-powered switch it would reduce the need to carry a wall-wart and power board (my laptop easily lasts the day on battery, so power for it isn’t a concern), or even better, a USB Ethernet adapter with integrated switch, since I need to carry a USB Ethernet adapter anyway. Then I could just piggy-back in between an existing computer and the wall outlet.
 Anyone know of such a beast? I have googled, and not found anything, but maybe my search terms are wrong.
 Edit. Since many are saying to refer to Corp IT, our corporate IT are aware of the situation, and their recommended solution is “go to a computer store and buy a cheap switch”. They are happy for us to do it, because it is cheaper for the few mobile staff to do that, than for them to get extra outlets wired in at each site that has hit capacity. This is about getting a switch that is smaller and more portable than the typical budget 5 port switch.

I managed to get exceptions implemented for most things, but one thing that I can&#x27;t seem to find a solution for is VS Code extension upgrades. It seems like this has been an issue for a long time now, and I was wondering if there are any URLs, EDLs, or applications to consider that would let relevant traffic be bypassed.

                              <span>So...stupid question but if I were to turn on &#x27;strong global encryption&#x27; at the firewall and disable weak algorithms then as long as everything communicating across the network accepted the remaining strong methods then we&#x27;d be alright, right? I mean, of course I&#x27;d want to follow up later on the switches (and GPO for Windows boxes) to make sure I disabled weak algorithms in all the places as well as setting AES strength. 
 I&#x27;m mostly concerned about all of the unforeseen consequences though. What will this do to our VMWare setup, will our linux boxes have any issues, printer communication and the like. You never know until it&#x27;s too late what might break when making major changes like this so any advice/thoughts on the matter are greatly appriciated.

                              <span>Hey there,
 one of the customers came lately with the idea to use a cloud-based firewall (FWaaS), e.g., as offered by Fortinet or PaloAlto, instead of a common hardware appliance, e.g., from Sophos.
 I have no experience using FWaaS from arbitrary providers (Fortinet, PaloAlto, uNameIt) but how is such a firewall actually operated? In most shiny white papers, they discuss the removal of the classical &quot;internal  perimeter  external&quot; architecture, but how is this actually done? Does each internal client simply use some kind of (VPN) tunnel to the FWaaS before routing to the internet or is a site-to-site VPN configured? Is a hardware firewall still in use on the customer network or is it just the clients + router?
 Hope you have some input for me for this issue, most white papers focus more on the marketing than on the technology.

 I am in Ashburn Virginia USA area and in dire need for LC/LC single mode fiber cables. Anyone know where I can buy some in this area? If someone is closeby and has free 10 cables, I would appreciate.
 EDIT:
 Thanks for your help. I was able to grab the cables from the two stores recommended in the comments. You&#x27;re all truly amazing.

                              <span>I recently built a lab for testing a redundant edge router deployment for a service provider environment. Initially, I used EVPN ESI LAG with virtual gateway address but also have a lab using VRRP instead. I have found a major roadblock in deploying IPv6 in these environments: there is no state redundancy for DHCPv6-PD. The routers I am using serve as DHCPv6 relays and my CPE uses DHCPv6-PD to request prefixes. The relays snoop the DHCPv6 process and dynamically build routing information to the requestor CPE’s WAN address for the delegated prefix. However, this state is only ever built on one edge router or the other, meaning if one of the routers fails, all routing state for the prefixes delegated via DHCPv6-PD is lost. Even though I have a redundant PE, the redundancy is useless.
 This blew my mind that there was no mechanism for hot-standby of the DHCPv6 relay state. I found an article that Huawei switches apparently have such a mechanism, but looks proprietary.
 I found an ipSpace blog post from over 10 years ago on this topic: https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/03/do-we-need-dhcpv6-relay-redundancy.html
 Anyone found a solution to this problem?

                              <span>I am looking at potentially integrating the networks that are open peering with Equinix IX&#x27;s into our internet routing tables. 
 I am curious for anyone that has integrated into an IX, did you see benefit from a connectivity/latency standpoint? I like the control aspect of this vs sending it through an internet carrier - I just don&#x27;t really know if there are &quot;true&quot; measurable benefits from doing so.

 Issue- When our controls get into the PLC/NAT they are kicked off the network (Due to connecting to the OT VPN) and they are unable to access any online note/email. Is there any way to setup another way to secure our OT network like a zero trust, VM, or any other options. Thank you!

                              <span>Hi, I come from a Cisco background and I&#x27;m getting confused about tagged ports.. the goal here is that all ports on my switch are VLAN17 for ports 1-46. Then port 47 &amp; port 48 need to talk to all the VLANS I have, which is 17,19,20&amp;50.
 Port 47 is connected to a WiFi AP that utilizes VLAN 19 for WiFi access, it uses VLAN 20 for Guest WiFi &amp; it uses VLAN 50 for its management IP. So I need port 47 to behave like a trunk and allow all my vlan traffic through.
 Port 48 is the uplink for the switch, connecting it to the rest of the network, so it also needs to be &quot;trunk&quot;-like and accept all the VLANs on my network.
 Does this config look correct to you guys, for an HP switch?
 vlan 17
 name &quot;NEW_VLAN&quot;

 exit
 vlan 20

 tagged 47-48

                              <span>Hello
 I work as an HPC engineer on our infiniband networks. For those familiar with infiniband I&#x27;m sure you know documentation and and resources in general are thin. I&#x27;m looking to setup a pretty complex lab environment at work to do some testing, but I was curious... Does anyone know of a utility like gns3 or packet tracer that is compatible with infiniband architecture? I need to do some testing with routing across multiple networks using the new Nvidia Skyway Gateway&#x27;s and want a bit of a virtual proof of concept before I rack and cable a bunch of things. 
 Kind of a long shot and a bit of a niche thing, but figured I&#x27;d put it out there and see if anyone has any info. Thanks in advance!

                              <span>I don&#x27;t know about you, but network mapping is fun to me.
 When I have some slow time at work, network mapping is one of my favourite activities. It is not stressful and I can take my time doing it.
 And it is useful as a part of documentation and monitoring.
 For me at least automated tools and protocols usually leave some gaps in the mapping, so manual intervention is always needed.
 And if you have a network of any notable size, it is cool to see once you are done. 
 What do you think?

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 I&#x27;m not that experienced with MPO-12 and am needing to buy some cables to connect at 100G. I wanted to check my understanding before i hit the order button. The transcievers are 100G-SR specification and needs OM4 duplex fibre according to cisco docs.
 To the questions... The trunk cable between the patch panels I&#x27;ve been told is &#x27;crossover&#x27; which i assume is reverse type B therefore.
 My understanding is then the patch leads could be polarity A (straight through) or Polarity B (reversed).
 For devices that are DIRECTLY connecting in the cabinet (not through patch panel) they would need to use polarity B (reverse) however.
 Am i being stupid or misunderstanding this! I only know it&#x27;s crossover trunk and it&#x27;s male. The Polarity C is confusing me slightly in honesty!
 Any pointers at all would be helpful from someone with experience in this area - thank you in advanced.

                              <span>I have a question about NAT networks.
 I understand the basics of how NAT networks work, but I&#x27;m interested in whether it is possible to check which private address connected to a given page on a given port.
 Example:
 We have a public address of 195.200.x.x
 We have 3 hosts:
 192.168.1.10
 192.168.1.11
 192.168.1.12
 And one of them connected to facebook on x port via NAT.
 Is there any way to check which user has connected to this page?

 From a practical standpoint, is it valid to filter on the P flag in Wireshark if I want to only see packets with payload?

 I&#x27;ve found pinging their remote IP is only so effective. I&#x27;m looking for something a little more robust.. that can actually show a visual graph we can show the user and say &quot;look, its your home wifi/ISP...&quot; (if it is in fact that.)

                              <span>Hi, as you all know many businesses use shared Android devices to provide their employees with access to corporate resources. However, managing these devices can be challenging, as they are often used by multiple people and may be exposed to a variety of security risks.
 Problem that businesses face:
 The following are some of the problems that businesses face when managing shared Android devices:
  
Security: Shared Android devices are at risk of being lost, stolen, or tampered with. This can lead to the unauthorized access of corporate data or the installation of malware.
 Compliance: Businesses must comply with a variety of regulations, such as data protection laws and industry standards. Managing shared Android devices can be difficult to do in a way that meets all of these compliance requirements.
 Cost: Managing shared Android devices can be expensive, as businesses need to purchase and maintain the devices, as well as the software and services needed to manage them.
  
Solution to their problem:
 There are a number of solutions that businesses can use to manage shared Android devices. These solutions include:
  
Mobile device management (MDM) software: MDM software can be used to remotely manage shared Android devices. This includes features such as remote wipe, password policies, and app management..
 Containerization: Containerization is a technique that can be used to isolate corporate data from personal data on shared Android devices. This helps to protect corporate data from unauthorized access.
 Bring your own device (BYOD): BYOD allows employees to use their own personal devices for work. This can help to reduce the cost of managing shared Android devices.

 I seem to be having a hard time finding a stand-alone router/AP to accomplish this in lieu of Omada or UniFi. Is there an option I’m overlooking?

                              <span>Does anyone out there know about CML? I want to get it for my CCNP labs. I asked my manager and he said to research it because he would like to make a vm that everyone in our network team could log in with when they want to do a lab. After googling I found out the VIRL is now CML. We are a university 
 They have different versions of CML and I have questions because I don&#x27;t know how to interpret their site perfectly. This is the website I&#x27;m reading from: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/cloud-systems-management/modeling-labs/index.html#~licensing 
 Personal - Single use only. Does this mean only 1 person can be logged in at once and others must wait until they are done, or does it mean only 1 person can be logged in and it always the same person logging in?
 Enterprise:
 - Multi user - Maybe this is what I really need.
 - What does TAC support mean? Will I be able to call someone and they can help me if I get stuck in a lab? I doubt it. Maybe it means they support in the setting up of the VM and installing the software?
 Higher Education:
 - I work at a university. Would this mean I can use this type of CML? Why would I choose this over enterprise? The site says it licenses for concurrent users instead of nodes. This makes me think enterprise works like this: you have license for 20 nodes. User 1 logs in and uses 5 nodes. User 2 logs in and uses 15 nodes. User 3 logs in and has no nodes to use until the other 2 users shut their labs down.

                              <span>Hey r/sysadmin,
 I wanted to share an issue we recently encountered with our Dell N3200 series switches we are deploying and how we managed to solve it. It might be helpful for anyone facing similar challenges in their network setup.
 The Problem: We were experiencing difficulties accessing the web interfaces of certain devices on our LAN. After some troubleshooting, we discovered that the root cause was related to the Dell N3200 series switches and their handling of packet fragmentation during inter-VLAN routing affecting mostly clients on the WiFi but also just across Data/Security/Voice VLANs.
 The Solution: Thankfully, we were able to resolve the issue by specifying the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of all the switches in our network. By setting the MTU to 1532 using the command #sys…</span>

 I got a pack of 32 GB USB&#x27;s and wanted to make a few Utility USB&#x27;s that I can use for alot of stuff such as an OS boot drive, maybe a Redkey, and also a Toolkit. I&#x27;ve been looking through to find the best option but most of the articles and post I find are 3 or more years old. Also if there are other USB Utilities to make LMK. 
 (I currently have a Windows PC, Raspberry Pi 4 with Linux, and I&#x27;m looking into getting a Mac so I&#x27;m open to any OS specific USB if that matters)

We will have some users that work at both sites/companies and some will be strictly company A and some B. I am the sole administrator so I want to make things easy on myself but my manager has asked if we can separate data and billing so if the sister company were sold in the future that it would be easier to transition data to the new owner.
 Is that something I should even concern myself with right now and just put them both under the same tenant?

                              <span>I just started as a junior sysadmin at a new company where they have a dedicated senior security engineer. After deploying a couple of VMs, I noticed that on all pre-existing servers the Windows Firewall is disabled, while I leave it enabled and only open the minimum required ports/protocols. When I asked about the reasoning behind this I got an answer which basically comes down to:
 - It can easily be bypassed by hackers so it&#x27;s not that useful
 - In a full Windows environment you need so many ports open that you might as well disable it
 - We have a good datacenter firewall (servers are segregated and firewalled in different vlans: mgmt, web, SAP, etc)
 - We don&#x27;t have the time/staff to figure out the required ports for all servers, and even for new servers it needs to be configured, documented, etc. 
 It felt a bit awkward to react to because I don&#x27;t want to come across as an asshole-know-it-all right from the start, but I tried to explain my opinion that I don&#x27;t see it as a magic solution for everything but just an additional layer in the entire security picture. In the end the conclusion was that we keep it disabled to keep it consistent with all the existing servers. Which is fine I guess, it&#x27;s not what I would do, but it&#x27;s not my call. To me it just seems weird and contradictory for a security engineer to have this kind of opinion, but at the same time the guy does have a lot of experience, so... Am I crazy? Is this a waste of time and better to just disable?

                              <span>Admittedly I&#x27;m not experienced with SQL server. Just wondering what everyone recommends for SQL server best practice with performance as a primary consideration?
 We have an application that uses SQL server as the backend database, and performance has been pretty crummy since implementation. 
 We&#x27;re replatforming the environment and I want to take best practices into consideration during the environment refresh. From what I&#x27;ve gathered here are some of the changes we&#x27;ll be making:
  
Separate application server and SQL server to be two separate VMs so SQL server is not fighting the application services for resources
 Create seperate virtual disks for C drive, DB drive, and logs drive (currently everything is just installed under C drive)
 Configure memory allocation settings to equal or greater value of the sum of all of your DB files if possible (it is doable in our env) -- From my understanding with manipulates the SQL server to favor logical reads vs. physical reads?
  
Any other recommendations? Any that I&#x27;ve listed above that are unnecessary/outdated? When setting memory do you set a minimum memory value or leave it at default? Right now our SQL instance max memory is set to 2147483647, should I leave that or set it explicitly to &gt;&#x3D; to the sum of DB files or does it not matter? When considering storage, we have an all flash Nimble SAN, should I be specifying any settings on the LUN for optimal performance or are those recommendations obsolete with the use of NVMe flash? Any maintenance tasks that can help optimize performance? And lastly, how do I validate that these changes have improved anything? Or rather, what is your method for validating and pinpointing the cause of performance issues in SQL server?

                              <span>SFP modules convert electrical data from the equipment to optical signals. There is no incoming power surging from an optical port to damage the equipment according to my undarstanding of fibre optics. SFP draws voltage/power from the equipment itself. So can wrong or incompatible SFP modules or cables damage the equipment itself, such as switches or network adapters or is the possible damage exetent is from the SFP module to the SFP module and the network equipment is safe from harm ?

                              <span>Hey there, 
 I just need to get something off my chest and have a little rant. I&#x27;m not even sure what I hope to achieve by posting this, but sometimes you just need to vent.
 I pride myself on being a self-motivated individual who actively seeks out opportunities to learn new things. I even go the extra mile by taking classes outside of work hours. When it comes to PowerShell, I&#x27;m absolutely passionate about it. Most of my projects revolve around automation, utilizing PowerShell, APIs, and Power Automate.
 But here&#x27;s where things take a frustrating turn. Our company got acquired by another company last year, and unfortunately, they don&#x27;t have many people with skills like mine. So, naturally, they&#x27;re quite pleased with my abilities, and I&#x27;ve been automating a significant portion of their processes.
 However, recently, something has been happening that I&#x27;m not comfortable with at all. Every time I update my manager on my progress, she insists on having two other individuals join the meeting. It&#x27;s as if she wants me to showcase everything I do to them. It feels like I can&#x27;t even perform a simple right-click on my computer without those two people hovering over me.
 Now, don&#x27;t get me wrong—I&#x27;m all for knowledge sharing. But here&#x27;s the issue: the focus should be on &quot;sharing.&quot; These individuals have their own projects, and I&#x27;m not included in any of them. 
 I think I&#x27;m the only person in the entire team who has to do something like this. It feels entirely one-sided. They seem to only want my knowledge without any interest in reciprocating or fostering my growth.
 It&#x27;s frustrating.

 Over the last 12 years of career, my philosophy is, settings in the DDP are settings that are any settings that are universally true and should not ever be overwritten under any circumstances regardless of what those settings are. 
 General Wisdom
 &quot;As a best practice, you should configure the Default Domain Policy GPO only to manage the default Account Policies settings, Password Policy, Account Lockout Policy, and Kerberos Policy. &quot; 
 Supporting Evidence (My Stance)
 - Settings such as &quot;Network Security: Force logoff&quot; are required to be in DDP contradicting their own guidance.
 - AD Engineers I have worked with at previous job specifically stated that guidance was not relevant post Windows Server 2003/ 
 My Argument:
 I deem the setting set in the DDP as universally true under any/all circumstances. Settings that no matter the user or computer, must have as part of the mandatory configuration baseline. These are almost all security-relevant settings. Any settings that would deviate from this &quot;universal truth&quot; is broken into a separate user/computer policy and applied as/where needed. My goal at the end of the day is K.I.S.S. and to me this the easiest way to achieve that.

 tldr; a security test that checks if a host is vulnerable to CVE-2023-34362 and attempts to execute techniques associated with Cl0p Ransomware Gang: https://www.preludesecurity.com/advisories/aa23-158a
 Longer Version
 I dropped in here a few weeks ago to better understand how CISA advisories flow through your organization.
 I&#x27;m back with something you can use. Basically, I&#x27;m curating (for now) CISA advisories and adding a security test (scale-ready TTP) to validate that you&#x27;re devices, if relevant, are protected.
 The first publicly promoted one (there are others avail) is for #CL0p Ransomware + exploitation of MOVEit Vulnerability CVE-2023-34362.
 This tests whether a host is vulnerable to CVE-2023-34362 and attempts to execute techniques associated with Cl0p Ransomware Gang, which is actively exploiting this vulnerability. There is a .go source code file available if you decide you want to see whats running on the endpoint. 
 Note: this test utilizes basic port and version verification scanning to identify if an endpoint is vulnerable and does not modify the endpoint in any way. Command execution does not attempt to modify the system in any harmful way.
 Here are the actual steps of the test:
  
Get the external IP of the endpoint.
 Exit PROTECTED if unable to determine external IP and continue if not.
 Execute a version check for the applicable MOVEit Transfer version.
 Exit PROTECTED if applicable MOVEit Transfer version is not found and continue if not.
 Execute ingress tool transfer by dropping a pseudo malicious DLL containing Cl0p artifacts to disk.
 Execute a file write containing Cl0p-specific ransom note verbiage to disk.
 Exit PROTECTED if the test is stopped. UNPROTECTED if not.
  
Give it a shot. Let me know what you think: https://www.preludesecurity.com/advisories/aa23-158a

                              <span>This server reboots itself every 15 minutes for no apparent reason. I investigated the logs, and there is no indication of anything out of the ordinary happening. I have metrics set up for it in the RMM tool, and it is running at 20% CPU and 15% RAM before shutting down. The thermals are within the normal range of 40-65.
 There have been no changes to the server since it began, and the updates have been running on the machines without difficulty for weeks.
 I&#x27;m attempting to figure out what&#x27;s going on because the problem is on our main DC; this is a tiny office with only one employee.
 What I&#x27;ve been up to since acquiring access to the machine.
 - Removed the updates - Verified the GPOs
 - Removed unnecessary apps - Examined the internals (everything fine)
 - Verified that the Windows Server Key was activated.
 - Examined the hard drive (it was fine).
 - Dism and Sfc scans
 I am thinking of reinstalling the OS and seeing if that may help. It makes it a little more complex as this is their only DC and only available machine.
 Any suggestions to move forward with this?

                              <span>Hi all. So ive hit a bit of wall with this issue we have been having at our office which I could really use some guidance on. Our office is surrounded on most sides by another training provider who seems to think that any and every room they move into needs around 2/3 AP&#x27;s. We are having issues where their AP&#x27;s seem to do a channel scan every 30 minutes or so and change their channels around which causes all our AP&#x27;s to hit 100% interference and connections drop off (We are using Unifi AP&#x27;s and Controller). On a normal day 2.4Ghz is 100% taken over with their 4 SSID&#x27;s overlapping themselves and the 5Ghz band is around 80% used up. We have tried to speak to them however they have said that it isn&#x27;t their problem and suggested we just boost the signal of ours (we tried that for the sake of it but it just ended in more interference) or move all our devices over to 5Ghz which we currently have set to do if the device supports it. We have plenty of AP signal strength to cover the office for both 2.4 and 5Ghz.
 We&#x27;ve wired everyone we can in but the top dogs at the company come in and demand that their teams calls must not drop for even a second while on wifi. Have any of you guys had this kind of issue and how was it resolved/dealt with as me telling and showing them the graphs and stats seem to fall on deaf ears. To add to all this we have also had the students and staff from the other company complain to us because every 30 minutes they all lose connection (which when i suggested they might want to check that setting they ignored).

 1.Can a specific group in our org be set to record? (ex. our CSR group for taking payment information)
 2.Does the &quot;record&quot; function need to be on all the time or can it be turned off and on by the user when need be?
 3.is it a cost per minute that&#x27;s recorded or by data size?
 4.How long is that data (conversation) retained for?
 5.Can we log our texts and import that into salesforce?
 Thank you!

 We would like to automatically set an initial 16 digit startup PIN for users and then the users can change it to a shorter and easier PIN themselves since changing the existing PIN doesn’t need admin rights.

                              <span>Hi,
 For context I&#x27;m a new student in sys/network admin (1y) and currently in internship. I&#x27;m not really &quot;new&quot; in info, I did 2y in dev web/app and I&#x27;m truly passionate in info in general, and more specifically now in sys/network admin. I love to fully understand how the things I use works and you problably saw the problem coming, sys/network admin is an ocean and I think I&#x27;m drowning.
 One solution will be to just take time but I don&#x27;t have much choice, I&#x27;ve to do a thesis for my school, and it have to be about a projet in my entreprise (RADIUS implementation + 802.1X). Big problem is, in my entreprise I don&#x27;t really have a &quot;mentor&quot;, honestly I don&#x27;t need someone who know everything but just explain me what do we have in the entreprise and how things connect each other. All I have is a lot of doc scattered.
 Balance between learn the basics, search what I&#x27;ve in my entreprise and understand how it works is really diffucult. I don&#x27;t want to complain about how life is difficult lmao, I&#x27;ve no choice but keep going however do you guys have advice to manage everything ? I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;m there, but how to reconize when you&#x27;re near to burn out ?
 Have a nice day

                              <span>TLDR: How does Windows identify known networks?
 ​
 I use Microsoft Always-On VPN, and it uses trusted network detection to determine if it&#x27;s on or off-prem. Sounds good. It&#x27;s supposed to use the DNS suffix issued by the DHCP to determine that. Except, it doesn&#x27;t... It seems to actually use the &quot;friendly name&quot; of the network, and therein lies the problem.
 ​
 My internal dns suffix is ad.company.com. I also have wireless for corp-owned devices, which hands out the same suffix. So, random users&#x27; laptops may create new known networks with names like &quot;Corp Wifi 2&quot; or &quot;ad.company.com 5&quot; and can use them interchangeably regardless of whether the device is hardwired or on wireless. Since AOVPN seems to want to use the friendly names instead of the dns suffix like the MS docs say it uses, clients will randomly decide that they&#x27;re off-prem and connect to the VPN server when they&#x27;re on-prem breaking any access to internal resources. My temporary workaround has been to blackhole any connections to the VPN server from within the network, but that&#x27;s causing other weird issues and delays in accessing network resources, though it ultimately does work.
 ​
 But you say, &quot;just use GPO to create a network profile so the name doesn&#x27;t change!&quot; I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;re absolutely correct, but when I&#x27;m creating the GPO, it appears to only let me select existing known networks on my computer, and it seems that I too have had those weird incremented network names in the past.
 ​
 Ultimately, my question is, how in the world is Windows fingerprinting the network, and why is it thinking the exact same network is a different one? Looking in the Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList\Profiles\ registry hive where that info seems to live, I don&#x27;t see anything like DNS suffixes, subnets, or anything other information that would be used to uniquely identify my corporate network.

                              <span>Hi! Hope you are doing great!
 The scenario is this: I have the ISP modem to a Fortigate 90D.
 As it is outdated my client decided to replace it and buy 2 Fortigates 60F and put them in HA. Thit is already configured and tested. 
 I understand that between the ISP modem and both Fortis, I must put a switch.
 My question is, do I have to configure something on the switch? Or the default configuration is enough for everything to work?

 When I disable the GPO &quot;Allow users to login with Biometrics&quot; it does disable the fingerprint sign in on the lock screen, but it reverts it to a PIN and the Finger Print option is totally disabled inside windows.
 Can we use Windows Hello inside Windows only and not on the lock screen?
 Thanks for any help!

                              <span>I am in the process of installing a new WiFi system (Meraki). In the past I have had an open system (no password) This is my reasoning - any password I create will ultimately be shared with everyone. If I ( and a select few ) only know the password, I am going to be only typing in the password all day long and nothing else gets done. I have a filter (Securly) so who ever gets on will be controlled as to where they surf. I am at a small rural school where the pavement literally ends at the school. 
 Am I wrong to not have a more secure system or even a guest network. I believe that my servers are buttoned down pretty tight and there is not critical info stored there (my SIS is hosted else where)
 I would like to understand pro&#x27;s and Con&#x27;s of how I am doing this or what I should change to.
 thanks in advance.

 Or maybe security shouldn&#x27;t have a backup, as in, either it works, or either they have to contact IT if it doesn&#x27;t work.?

 Any advice appreciated.. Thanks

                              <span>Hey all,
 I got a message this morning from one of our reps that an email from their client is being bounced back with the error &quot;remote server returned 554 5.0.0 the account xxxxx@domain.com is disabled&quot;
 The email this person is trying to contact on our end is a google group, which is receiving emails from others with no issue. It is also receiving email from others on that email chain without problem. 
 I used mxtoolbox to take a look at the sender domain, and nothing is blacklisted. The email is coming from a Microsoft exchange server from what I can tell. 
 There is no block of the domain in our Workspace admin console. 
 I did a bit of searching and found this post - https://forum.bestpractical.com/t/inbound-emails-bounce-for-a-specific-active-user/32256 
 But I do not believe the sender is sending from a google account in the first place, and their email account is clearly active. 
 The above linked post also points to this google article here, but as the sender does not appear to be using a google account, and our google group is not disabled and is actively sending emails, I am at a loss.
 Any idea how to proceed from here? I appreciate any and all advice!

                              <span>So got the printers added to the server with IP address, shared them, added in to the AD, set up the deployment for User profile, test it, that works, but when I go to check the printer ports on the target machine it&#x27;s set them up with IPs instead of going through the \\server\Brotherxxx share name, which obviously isn&#x27;t how we wanted it, should go PC-Server-printer.
 Any ideas?

                              <span>Hello Community,
 we use Cisco Meraki &amp; NPS for WiFi Authentication (Device Certificate based).
 The device is a hybrid joined Windows device that obtains its certificate through intune. (on prem PKI,NDES Connector). For Fallback purposes we defined multiple RADIUS Servers (NPS Servers) on meraki.
 Here comes the problem:
 As long as the NPS Server resides inside in the same domain as the AD Computer object there is no problem with authentication, but if the NPS Server is located in different domain (Domain Trust established ofc) authentication fails with &quot;NULL SID&quot;. We did have this setup working in the past (with an orphaned domain we wanted to get rid off)
 Any idea what can cause that problem?

                              <span>Hi all, I have a question that I am trying to troubleshoot with users and I am really struggling so I thought I would reach out to see if anyone has seen similar.
 When a user who uses Windows 11 tries to RDP to a server there is a delay between clicking &#x27;Connect&#x27; and the password prompt appearing. This delay is about 5 minutes from our testing but once it has happened and the password box appears then all is fine from then on, no other slowdowns at all. This happens to servers both on the same site and remotely.
 While the delay is happening, there is a screen in the background that you cannot interact with or click to have appear, only if you hover over it from the taskbar do you see it. A screenshot of which is linked here: https://imgur.com/a/9XDdwDH.
 If we delete the cache for RDP (as noted here: https://www.tachytelic.net/2019/01/clear-rdp-cache/) then it works once as normal but the delay occurs again on subsequent connections until the cache is cleared again. I can&#x27;t see anything in the cache that would cause a delay like this, its only impacting Windows 11 machines and it only started this week.
 Has anyone seen anything like this before?

                              <span>I have a series of background tasks written in Python such as checking for today&#x27;s date, monitoring my inbox for specific emails, triggering some reminders etc.
 At the moment, I have managed to schedule those tasks to start at a specific date and time, or at specific events using the windows task scheduler (WTS). However, I have come up with several issues:
 1. For some of these tasks, like the inbox monitoring script, I need them to run continuously in the background, and for some of them I need specific time scheduling (run between this and this date)
 2. 1. For some of these tasks, I need to implement some stopping clauses (ie. events that terminate these tasks external to the list of events provided by WTS). An example of such, is when some specific file was saving into a folder (the background tasks keeps checking the existence of that folder continuously/periodically) or when an environment variable is modified following another user manipulation.
 3. It is easy for the user to shut the task by mistake, and I have little to no traceability of these tasks in WTS
 My question is: Do I need to consider a virtual machine or setting up a container (using Windows containers or Docker) to achieve a better orchestration of these tasks? The goal is to have a clearer overview of all the tasks that are running, their state (terminated, failed or running) as well as ensure that I can implement some stopping clauses for these tasks.
 Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you.

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I was just wondering if anyone had any advice of how to switch my career from infrastructure engineer to Devops/cloud engineer. Bit of context. I have been working 4 years now with experience on prem and in cloud. This contains VMware suite, racking and stacking of network,storage and compute ,windows server, win10, AD, azure console, AWS console. I’m noticing in my company the ‘Devops’ team are automating a lot of existing processes and would love to hear of anyone who’s made the jump!
 Thanks :)

Seems like another honey-trap from the Oracle licensing team.

                              <span>Hi,
 I wanted to ask how others do it. I am an IT admin in a it-system house for various customers and for the IT-system house itself. During my day the following work comes up: • new orders from customers - install hardware and replace it with existing one, software installations and setups - come via email from our ERP system • incidents and less time-consuming changes in the existing system - come in via our ticket system • Projects, some of which last one or more weeks, sometimes involving several colleagues from other departments Fixed appointments, which are entered in the Outlook calendar My problem is that there are so many things, and there is a mess in my head the whole workday. I look in the Outlook calendar, in the ticket system, in OneNote in my to-do list and, as I said before, I always have this feeling that I might forget something. How do you do that to get an order in your tasks?

                              <span>Hi there,
 Do your companies need to scan documents in a web app?
 I just went through an SDK called Dynamic Web TWAIN which provides such a function. It runs a service which works as a bridge between scanners and web pages.

 ​
 On my Windows 2022 terminalservers, I am getting error messages, which I do not really understand:
 ​
 EventID: 36861, Schannel
 A fatal error occurred while creating a TLS client credential. The internal error state is 10013.
 The SSPI client process is smartscreen (PID: 10252). 
 ​
 I found some posts about problems with other services, but nothing about smartscreen.
 Do you have any idea, why this happens and how I can solve this?
 ​
 I did already disable Defender and &quot;sending examples to the cloud&quot; on the systems, but the events are still logged.
 ​
 Thank you for your help

                              <span>Hey guys, i have i few developers in my company use virtualbox,hyper-v, etc. to test their software or use some tools that are only available on linux. Those vms are not in any way managed by IT, so no av or other hardening that is usually enforced via policy.
 We have different vlans for prod and dev but i can&#x27;t think of way to enforce that the vm is only allowed into dev vlan as the employeen could just change the interface in virtualbox, hyper-v etc. 
 The end result should be that employee device and the vm&#x27;s should be in different vlans. Maybe someone here went through something similiar like this and has some input?
 Well, thanks in advance.

                              <span>Good day to you all,
 ​
 I am currently struggling with implementing Intune for our devices. Long story short its related to blocking USB Devices, BUT allow certain ones.
 ​
 We are running a hybrid AD to make things even more fun. Company has never used Intune further than to test it for Mobile devices, but now wants to use it just for the USB issue. We are also running a inventory program that is doing all the heavy lifting, which should stay that way. Does Intune screw with inventory programs?
 I have looked on a few microsoft resources already, but non have been able to solve the issue.
 ​
 I did try to join a device via corperate portal but since the device is already AD joined it wont let me past the domain join page. Besides that I did also try autoenrollment, but that was also unfruitful.
 ​
 Any ideas?
 ​

Wondering how many of you have had similar experiences?

 I enabled the shadow copies in a C drive last 04/07/2023, but I realized that it only saves the copy of the day.
 It seems that the copies are overwritten every day, and I have only the copy of the day, but not the old copies:

 How could I do to solve this issue and have more copies?
 Thank so
 much.

 ​
 I&#x27;m facing an issue I can&#x27;t find anything about by googling but as a long time lurker in this forum I&#x27;m sure someone here can help me ;-)
 ​
 I&#x27;m installing clients with Opsi via PXE-boot. After the installation of Windows 11 I can enable bitlocker with PIN but it&#x27;s not the familiar blue screen. It&#x27;s like bitlocker is in some legacy mode: https://imgur.com/a/EmNk5Ht
 I can install Windows 10 just fine the same way and bitlocker looks normal.
 So far I&#x27;ve tried to install the os manually from the same image (normal bitlocker), installing the os via opsi without any follow up packages (legacy bitlocker), creating a new winpe for Windows 11 (legacy bitlocker) and different settings in BIOS (legacy bitlocker).
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>Hi everyone! I am a System Admin for the place I work at and we&#x27;re in the process of buying a GPU Server for AI workloads. We already have a normal server with Proxmox as the OS, while this new server would be configured with Windows Server 2022, since we don&#x27;t need to create VMs on it and installing Nvidia drivers on Windows is less of an headache.
 Is there any platform we can use to manage both servers at the same time, without having different panels for each of them? I&#x27;ve already considered installing Proxmox on the second server and creating a cluster with both of them, but it would be necessary to configure PCI passthrough for the GPU to work with the VMs, and as for all I&#x27;ve read it is not really stable, so I would really like to avoid it, if there are any other ways. 
 Thanks! And sorry if I did any mistakes, it&#x27;s one of my first posts on Reddit.

                              <span>Some things to keep in mind when it comes to secrets management:
 - Secrets management is a major challenge for organizations and can lead to leaks and breaches.
 - Stolen credentials are frequently used to gain access to an organization&#x27;s systems.
 - Revoking credentials is more important than rotating them in the event of a leak.
 - A well-oiled credential management system should have closed loops to maintain a desired state.
 - Detective controls and logging are important for detecting credential usage and leaks.
 - Expiry times for credentials should be carefully considered to balance security and practicality.
 - Store credentials only where they are needed to avoid single points of failure.
 - Secure enclaves provide the highest level of security for storing credentials.
 - Utilize reliable authentication mechanisms rather than implementing your own.
 - Regularly check for weak secrets by comparing hashes.

                              <span>Hi guys,
 this morning, the vCLS VMs on all 3 ESXi nodes were automatically shutdown, changed and started up again. Never seen this before. No VCSA or ESXi updates have been performanced.
 Initiator: vpxd-extension-Changed: config.tools.pendingCustomization: ...ANDconfig.extraConfig(&quot;tools.guest.desktop.autolock&quot;).value: &quot;true&quot; -&gt; &quot;TRUE&quot;
 Added: config.extraConfig(&quot;tools.deployPkg.fileName&quot;): (key &#x3D; &quot;tools.deployPkg.fileName&quot;, value &#x3D; &quot;hdcs.cab&quot;)
 Any advice or addtional info is much appreciated.Is this expected behavior, or should i initate panic sequence?
 regards
 ​

                              <span>This is more of a theoretical situation, but I&#x27;m really curious.
 Let&#x27;s say that I had a laptop get stolen, and it was enrolled into Autopilot. So as I understand it; if the machine gets wiped in any capacity, it will contact MS and do it&#x27;s configuration again.
 But what would happen if someone unauthorized tries loads a version of Windows Home on the machine? Would it still &quot;enroll&quot; into Autopilot and prevent the device from being used?

                              <span>Is it necessary to use the same brand of firewall for access points in order to ensure compatibility? Currently, we have both Sophos and Unifi. When applying traffic shaping, it does not seem to affect the Wi-Fi. What would be the appropriate solution for this issue?

                              <span>Hey Reddit community,
 I&#x27;m facing an issue with IP address translation using NAT, and I could really use some assistance. Here&#x27;s the situation:
 I have a packet coming from a client within my subnet (let&#x27;s call it Subnet A), but it&#x27;s intended for a server with a public IP address outside Subnet A. I want to translate the destination address of the packet, so that my router directs it to a private IP address within Subnet A instead.
 I&#x27;ve been trying to figure out how to accomplish this, but I&#x27;m not quite sure which NAT feature or configuration would be suitable for my case. I&#x27;ve explored options like &quot;Virtual Server&quot; and &quot;Port Forwarding,&quot; but they seem to be geared towards incoming packets from outside the subnet.
 I&#x27;ve read about Destination NAT but I checked the 5 different routers I have available at the office and none of them support DNAT. I&#x27;ve seen on the internet that some people use routers that work with line commands instead of an HMI interface, but I also don&#x27;t have one of those.
 Can anyone guide me on how to achieve this translation within my network? Are there any specific NAT settings or techniques I should be looking into? Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>2 sites have a dark fibre link between them (not yet connected). Each has a watchguard and their own broadband connections which will remain in place.
 Am I right in thinking the best solution to get each site communicating with one another is to connect fibre directly to firewalls, give the interfaces an IP and then create a static route on either side? Both sites have their own single /24 lan.
 Then I will add a firewall policy allowing specified traffic over the route.
 I feel like I&#x27;ve been overthinking this and I&#x27;m also not fully familiar with watchguards just yet but will be working with them a lot over the coming months.

                              <span>I know I’m going to get the obvious answer to this one, but why is this technology called EFM? I.e. what is after the first mile. With Ethernet being a protocol rather than a physical material, I don’t fully understand the meaning of this name.
 I maybe thought Fibre Ethernet but EFM by design is a copper service.
 Edit: It seems like the First Mile is actually just referring to the entire length of the connection between you and the exchange. And Ethernet is jsut referring to copper over Ethernet. Right?

 ​
 Helping a friend out who is renovating a music venue. It is a 3000 capacity venue, somewhat of an open ballroom style space - I’m helping delegate where cameras, AP’s, etc are going to go as this was overlooked previously. Edit - I am not necessarily doing anything end to end on this project, just trying to help a group who is trying to delegate to contractors. 
 Is ubiquiti sufficient to just use across the board for this kind of thing? Every phone won’t be on the network as far as I know unless they opt for a public network, so likely an artist and staff network. 
 Any suggestions as to what to use for ap&#x27;s and or just some back end tips and advice to help me talk and walk through some things to help figure out cable pulls?

 Does anyone else use Ekinops, and have RADIUS working correctly. Obviously, we&#x27;re stuck configuring them all with Local, but hotswaps, require RDP into the techs laptops, etc etc.
 Any help would be awesome.
 BTW, this was my first project to handle coming into Transport.

 I have a Cisco 350 series managed switch but its in a locked rack and the cables between the presentation panel and the switch have been tidily bundled up so you cannot visually trace them from ppanel to switch through the glass door. 
 I have been shown in the past a helpful Web based GUI where you can plug a laptop into a socket in the office and (providing its patched) go to this GUI and it will show you various bits of information like the switch name, the port you&#x27;re connected to and the VLAN etc etc. 
 Can someone please fill in the big blank space in my head for this webbish GUI?
 I don&#x27;t have access to the switch so I can&#x27;t CLI or use any internal facing interface.

                              <span>Synopsis: I have 2 VPCs with different CIDRS, each with a public and private subnet. There is an Ubuntu in each public subnet with an WG setup, which connects the two VPCs.
 Goal: My goal is to be able to connect to a machine in the private subnet of one of the VPCs from a machine in the private subnet of the other VPC over the WG connection, without setting up additional WG instances on the machines in the privates subnets. 
 Detailed Setup:
 1. VPC_cloud:
 - CIDR: 172.16.0.0/21 - public_subnet CIDR: 172.16.0.0/24 - private_subnet CIDR: 172.16.1.0/24 - WG ip address: 192.168.0.1/24
  
VPC_edge:
 CIDR: 10.0.0.0/24
 public_subnet CIDR: 10.0.0.0/26
 private_subnet CIDR: 10.0.0.64/26
 WG ip address: 192.168.0.2/24
  
In my current setup I am able to ping 192.168.0.1 from the WG Machine in VPC_edge and vice versa. I&#x27;m also able to ping the none WG ip of the WG machine in VPC_cloud from the WG machine in VPC_edge and vice versa. Like:ubuntu@10.0.0.10 ping 172.16.0.4 (and vice versa) works. But any other instance (except for the WG instance itself) on the same VPC can&#x27;t be reached. IP forwarding is also enabled on both machines, BTW.
 As I understand the problem is with my routing, since WG setup works as expected, but I&#x27;m not sure what do do. Any help/advise is appreciated. Thanks! BTW, this is no homelab. It&#x27;s a PoC that will be used in production. I&#x27;m sorry if this isn&#x27;t the right place to ask.

                              <span>Researching, it seems that a local multiplexing in VDSL2 style with vectoring may be the best, I found devices such as this: https://www.planet.com.tw/en/product/vc-231g?c1&#x3D;media-conversion&amp;c2&#x3D;ethernet-extender&amp;c3&#x3D;ethernet-over-phone-wire-extender
 Where they claim 150 Mbit synchronous transferrates.
 Is there any other/better way? How would you as a specialist or expert approach the task?

                              <span>I have an eem script that auto-detecs when an interface has got a specific mac address vendor device connected to it, and changes it to the appropriate vlan. The problem is that, these specific devices, when they are initially connected to the switch, they bounce the interface a few times. usually 3 or 4 beforfe they actually stabilize (i think its part of their boot process). As a result, my eem script is being triggered several times for the same port, which is resulting in, not only waste of resources, but also, when my switch reboots and all the devices are detected at once, i run out of tty lines and the script fails. 
 Here is a snippet of my script:

 Does anyone know any reliable electronics/automation products distributor in Chicago/Illinois? Or does everyone just buy stuff from Amazon/Newegg nowadays ?
 We&#x27;re starting small in the US, catering to system integrators at first with our MIT Industrial Ethernet Switch.
 It would be great if you guys can offer some insights!
 Thank you in advance!

Since know is summer vocations time most of the staff are on vocations or working from home and it is a little difficult to understand DOCSIS since i dont have a mentor to work with me all the time. Where can i read, or watch videos so i can get the base concepts of DOCSIS until the staff is back to work on regular basis.

                              <span>So I know this isn’t a technical question, but I figure we all have similar struggles. 
 How the hell do you get in steps or exercise? 
 How much time a day or week do you dedicate to physical activity?
 How much water do you consume?
 There’s days I get in at 7:30 and realize I haven’t gotten up to even piss and it’s noon already. By the time I get home I’ve walked about 1500 steps for the day and am tired. 
 It’s a vicious circle.

Do I give Palo a try or buy Fortinets and have money left over to buy tenable.io and some other defense in depth solution like a patch management system? Thoughts from others that have been down this road are appreciated.

                              <span>Greetings folks.
 The HR department at my current place of employ is pushing us to deploy a product called &quot;Indie&quot; by a Pioneera
 This thing is basically an AI plugin to teams which listens to everything (calls. Chats. Channels. Mentions. Everything), and &quot;nudges&quot; you to be more production/healthier/various other things - all things HR wants to push.
 The trouble is, it has some requirements which wave massive red flags at me from a security perspective - quite ignoring the &quot;listens to everything&quot; aspect, which is way, way too big brother for my liking.
 Some include
  
Uses OATH to access Azure for AD mappings, and wants access to everything - the entire AD detail of every user in Azure - names, phones, group memberships o- you name it.
 ridiculously high security permissions in Microsoft365 - including, but not limited to, reading the user profile, reading and writing all chat messages, reading all mail in all mailboxes the user has access to, and other levels which simply boggle my mind.
 No indication of where data is stored (we are a multinational company with staff all over the world, including in GDPR covered locations)
 Infinite time data storage unless specifically instructed by the company to delete it
  
There&#x27;s a lot more issues jumping out, but those are the biggies.
 So - has anyone here actually implemented this thing anywhere? Have any experiences - good or bad - from a security/administration perspective to relate? I can&#x27;t find any genuine reviews online from any source I actually trust to be objective - I&#x27;ll take anything anyone knows onboard.
 I realise this may be a little obtuse for anyone here to have actually come across it, and if it gets me nothing, at least I tried.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hey everyone,
 I&#x27;m facing a challenge and I&#x27;m hoping to get some help from this community. 
 This one is pretty basic, so I’ll lay it out there. 
 We have an offshore team member who urgently needs VPN access with Remote Desktop to sign in from their laptop to a machine hosted in the United States. It&#x27;s crucial for them to work with EMRs and maintain secure access for auditing data.
 Currently, I&#x27;m stuck because the RDP is configured by Microsoft for in-network access only. Therefore, I&#x27;m looking for a VPN solution that I can quickly download and configure to enable immediate access for our team member. I apologize for the broad question, as I&#x27;m currently on my way home and seeking a timely solution. 
 It&#x27;s worth noting that we have a Watchguard Firebox firewall with VPN capabilities, but I&#x27;m hoping to provide access as quickly as possible. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Been feeling boomer-ish and not using the new features that browsers have been pushing out. Finally decided to just try it out and it solved my issue of having a billion tabs open for different services.
 Now I can have azure, defender, intune with 20+ tabs or whatever and just minimize the groups/tabs not being used.
 You can also name the groups.

Is somebody telling newbs that all the jobs are in cybersec? Do you think the average org has a 2:1 ratio of security to ops?

It is working as users get the prompt to login but once logged in they get a prompt to &#x27;Make teams the default chat app for Office&#x27; and then requires admin credentials. 
 These PC&#x27;s don&#x27;t have office installed for one. I&#x27;ve tried setting the DefaultIMAPP to &#x27;Teams&#x27;, which didn&#x27;t work. MS support have been little help so far, suggesting I set OPTIONS&#x3D;&quot;noAutoStart&#x3D;true&quot; when installing but that doesn&#x27;t change anything from what I&#x27;ve seen. 
 ChatGPT suggested setting Software\Microsoft\Office\Outlook\Addins\TeamsAddin.FastConnect &#x27;LoadBehaviour&#x27; to 3, but that also did not work. 
 Has anyone else encountered this issue? I have feeling I&#x27;m just not googling the right things to get the solution I need.

                              <span>Hi all, 
 Trying to get my head around how SSO works with NetSuite. Once setup I was expecting to be redirected to my IDP for authentication and then given access to the roles within NS however I&#x27;m still logging in via NS and then selecting the role with no interaction with Azure. 
 ​
 I&#x27;ve created the SSO role as per documentation and test from azure is successful however we have many roles for different aspects of NS. When I&#x27;ve setup for other applications in the past its been more of a blanket SSO if that makes sense. 
 Appreciate any help and apologies if I&#x27;m not clear in my post.

                              <span>So the short story is we are an independent reseller. The company we sell for used lotus notes for a long time which enabled us to share company address books with all the other independent reps.
 They decided to go to Salesforce and everyone had to move to o365. Which breaks the address book sharing. Are they any way to recreate that feature with the other reps?

 I haven&#x27;t done a Google Workspace to Microsoft 365 Mail migration before so I&#x27;m unsure on what to expect.They currently have an Microsoft 365 tenancy and are using the onmicrosoft.com domain to grant them access to the Office 365 desktop suite via Business Basic. 
 We are going to be purchasing Microsoft Business Premium for the current users but unsure of the implications of per-exisiting users on the 365 tenancy.
 I&#x27;ve read through dozen of Microsoft articles and resources on the internet and I&#x27;m starting to plan out the steps involved in getting the mail data across to the Microsoft 365 tenancy. The steps I&#x27;m thinking of following are:

                              <span>Hei all,
 I‘m trying to benchmark (and ultimately convince my manager that we need additonal head counts) how many FTEs, IT organizations in a similar size to us have.
 We are approx. 130x Users across three sites (Three different countries) with 1.5 FTEs. 
 We mainly leverage Microsoft 365 and some legacy On-Prem Systems and manage the network Infra (centralized) for all sites.
 We have an MSP for our Firewalls and one doing 1st Level (basically routes all tickets to me) but thats it.
 Thanks for your inputs :)

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 we migrated our print server and deployed a policy that simply remove tha installed printers on pcs and recreate them with the new network path.
 Everything works but we have a printer that keeps spawning with the old configuration. There&#x27;s no trace on the policy of it and i have no idea on how it creates itself after a login (and before of the printer policy).
 Do you guys have an idea on how i could investigate what is creating that printer? I looked on event viewer without luck.
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi all,
 Been having an issue with this for awhile now, and just wondering what the general accepted procedure would be.
 Our setup: Multiple O365 tenants using Veeam for Office 365 backup Onprem AD sync to Azure AD/O365 
 When a user leaves, I believe the other techs are manually removing their account in O365 and disabling their AD account, however we then get a large list of warnings on our Veeam job report that it can no longer find the users. The way I&#x27;ve been dealing with that is manually excluding those users from further backups.
 I know this is not a good practice, just not too sure of what would be considered good practice? Our Veeam provider has suggested we create essentially an &#x27;All Users&#x27; group and only backup that group, however that relies on multiple people actually adding new users to this group at creation. 
 Any help/suggestions would be amazing

 Any ideas on why this message would be marked as failing DMARC?

                              <span>Hello,
 I´m in academic Institution and so far we are striving to get lost of as many as possible standardPoolPCs. I guess the times changed , and we were a classic computer pool for long time..
 For like 20 years we bought like everytime Dell Optiplex SFF (SmallFormfactor) with midrange Dell Monitors. We buy stuff on like 5 year rollation every half oft , so this year we gonna find a followup configuration to really 10 year old PCs (Optiplex 3020 , sff, Celeron, 4gb RAM , 400 GBHDD)
 So far we are like to about buy a Optiplex 3050 ssf, I3-12100 as standard with 8GB and 256 nvme, which is enough. Monitorwise a 24 Inch Dell is intented.
 But since Corona the students put money in their equipment and so there are many more laptops which have thunderbolt or USB-C PD
 so we are planning to buy decent and good monitors/screens with integrated KVM / LAN (LAN is important because in the rooms there is no sufficient WIFI, we will use eduroam 802.1X for connections)
 recently i tried those Configurations* Dell P2723QE mit USB-C Hub (fi this review : https://www.pcworld.com/article/630195/630195.html)* Fujitsu Fujitsu P2711 TS QHD mit USB-C (https://www.fujitsu.com/de/products/computing/peripheral/displays/p2711-ts-qhd/)
 with both USB-C PD (Powerdelievery works fine)with both Screen is connected properly
 ... we tried like 5 Devices on it, just to get a feelingt..
 no Problems so far, unless sometimes there seems to be some freezes in LAN , one Windows 11 Device connected to usb-C also lost totally the LAN connection. Strange but it seems like Realtek Network 8153 related Problems which occur sometimes on specific situations.
 ​
 Questions to you:
 Do you guys have any suggestions on good other KVM Integrated Screens? Which is your favorite?
 Do you guys have other Ideas towards my plan. First I tended to buy USB-C Docks, but now I think integrated is way better!

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m currently an IT intern and one project I&#x27;m looking into is creating a script or app that automates the deprovisioning process for our end users across all the different platforms we use (365, azure, google, slack, etc.). I have more of a coding background than I do an IT background so I definitely think it&#x27;s doable, just wondering if anyone who&#x27;s delved into this before has any good tips or a solid starting point? Thanks!

 We had hardware failure on the machine hosting our DC VM. This is NOT the primary DC and has no FSMO roles assigned. The server OS is Server 2012R2 (Host is running the same).
 After restoring a backup and re-creating the VM, I see that I am not able to log in with a domain username. I tried demoting the DC but got an error. Local admin account is working of course but thats about it. I have spent 2 days looking through forums but so far nothing has helped.
 I would appreciate any help with this. Thank you so much in advance!

                              <span>Hello, 
 In our current situation we have a large portion of our infrastructure being managed by the IT department of our parent company. Everything down to the ESXI hosts are their responsibility, while the virtual servers of our factories are our own responsibility. This works reasonably well, although I wouldn&#x27;t mind having my own team doing the managing like I am used to at other jobs (lets just say we have had our issues with the IT department, like them running WEP SSID&#x27;s till end 2022). 
 Anyway, when we run a project we request a new virtual server, they deploy one via a template and we get on our way. We use their KMS server to activate our Windows products and occasionally when there is Office on the server installed to activate that too. 
 Now we run into the situation that we are most likely being sold. The IT manager of our parent company informed us today that they do not want to assist with creating new servers (requested 10 more) because when moving to the new owner they expect us to create new servers with them and moving the application and data over, and not move the virtual servers itself. 
 The servers run in our own domain separate from the parent company, meaning they have no cached administrative credentials or anything like that saved on our VMs that could potentially leak. Their reasoning for migrating applications + data rather than the VM itself is because of Windows licensing. But from my limited experience with KMS a Windows server will contact the KMS to renew their activation every X months. Surely we could simply release the current licenses being assigned to our servers via KMS, switch over to the KMS of the new owner and bobs your uncle? 
 Or does KMS licensing work differently? 
 Any insight would be appreciated!

 We want to set up a KMS Server for offline activation (are completely disconnected from the Internet and partially not in the domain) of Windows 10/11 Client as well as for Windows Server 2019+2022. 
 But how do we get the KMS host key now? We can&#x27;t find it in M365 portal. I have read that the old Volume Licensing Center is no longer supported. I can only see the different Keys for example Windows server 2019 0/120 available in the M365 Portal.
 Is this still a viable way with KMS? Can someone help me? Thanks a lot.

 Azure - Networking - West Europe - Investigating
 Starting at 07:22 UTC on 05 Jul 2023, a subset of Azure customers in West Europe may experience packet drops, timeouts and increased latencies in responses. We determined a number of fiber links between datacenters have become unavailable due to a fiber cut. Automated systems are balancing load and rerouting traffic, but customers may still experience degradation.
 Current Status: Our investigations are showing that service-to-customer communications over Internet/Express route are not experiencing impact currently, with impact predominantly to internal service-to-service communications from one datacenter to another datacenter in the West Europe region.
 We continue exploring multiple mitigation options. The next update will be provided in 60 minutes, or as events warrant.

                              <span>Hi All, 
 This is driving my around the twist, so thanks for any help. 
 I have a specific scenario that would normally be prevented but has been allowed through under special request from the higher ups. 
 The context is this - 
 A user wishes to connect via the standard RDP client from a off domain device to their work laptop. This would not normally be allowed, but hey ho. 
 The mitigation i am putting in place are these : 
 Firewall rule to only allow a connection from the static local IP of his device on the RDP port
 Preventing drive mapping.
 Preventing Clipboard. 
 To achieve this it appears a local group policy can be created. This policy then changes the following keys: 
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server - DisableDriveRedirection &#x3D; 1
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services - fDisableCdm &#x3D;1
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server - DisableClipboardRedirection &#x3D; 1
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services - fDisableClip &#x3D; 1 
 I have enabled all of these however I&#x27;m still able to connect with local drives mounted from the off domain device to the on domain device, aswell as access the data on them. 
 The goal is to prevent file transfer and copy + paste. 
 I may be missing something really obvious. I&#x27;m deploying the reg keys via intune, I&#x27;m aiming to avoid local GP so that if the user changes device or moves to a new one the settings are deployed down. 
 Thanks all in advice, Sorry if this is a really obvious solution, It may be a case of getting in too deep and not being able to see the trees from the woods.

 Would you recommend Meraki for a company without a dedicated network engineer?

                              <span>I work for a small company and we use a Zebra ZDesigner GK420D for our shipping labels. When printing labels, the right-most-side either has just a few spots of ink or is completely blank.
 This means that part of the barcode is not printed and it is not scannable by the courier. We temporarily have to print all labels on normal paper and secure them with tape.
 We suspect that the printing head may be failing, but the replacement part is very expensive. Do you know what may be causing this issue a part from a failing printing head?
 I have already been through multiple resets and calibration protocols, but nothing seems to be working.
 Hope you can help - thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi Reddit,
 Probably a simple query but not something I have come across before.
 We operate one of our tenants on Microsoft 365, in which we have 3 domains.
 There has always been a main/default domain to which users are set when created, however last week a handful of users has their default domain changed, seemingly randomly.
 Some users received a pop-up in outlook asking to restart as the exchange admin has made a change.
 Is there a best way to check why this happened?
 I was looking through the audit page however non of the parameters seemed correct in this scenario.
 Cheers, all!

                              <span>Hello,
 i just set up 2 new Samsung 27&quot; monitors for a bit older PC which only has 1 HDMI, 1 VGA and 1 DVI output. Only the Monitor connected to the HDMI output works. When i hook the second one up with either DVI or VGA Windows detects the monitor but it doesn&#x27;t display anything unfortunately.
 So my question is, can I connect one monitor to the PC via HDMI and then run a DP cable from 1st to 2nd monitor? The PC is located a bit far away so i can&#x27;t test it right now, that&#x27;s why i ask here..
 Or does anyone have another idea why the 2nd monitor gets detected but won&#x27;t display anything?
 Best regards,
 Fernando.

 I&#x27;m currently doing a file server migration using Robocopy. 
 I used the following commands to copy the folder to new server WITHOUT security permissions. 
 I want to copy only folder &amp; files / subdirectories.
 When attempting to open folder on destination file server then it says &quot;Unable to display current owner.&quot;
 is it normal ? 
 NEW FILE SERVER: (it says &quot;Unable to display current owner.&quot;)

                              <span>Hi All,
 I’ve been tasked with conducting a research into the possibilities to configure Azure Active Directory programmatically and monitor for configuration drift afterwards. The first seems to be covered by the Graph API, well at least for a large part, but I can’t find any information about monitoring configuration drift for Azure AD. I had hoped that Azure policy could be used for that, but apparently AAD seems to be out-of-scope for Azure Policy. 
 Does anyone have some information or pointers I can use to cover these questions.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all,
 If I apply this patch, my 2 DCs have broken KDC service. I think it&#x27;s the evolution of Netlogon that does it but I can&#x27;t seem to fix it.
 The registry key &quot;KrbtgtFullPacSignature&quot; is 2 and I can&#x27;t change it to 0 because I have to upgrade a NetApp NAS.
 If anyone has a lead, I take it.
 Thx

                              <span>Hi everyone, just a frendly reminder that DNS is always the culprit. 
 This morning when I arrived at the office, I couldn&#x27;t do anything. I started troubleshoot the problem, trying to see if one of our links to the outside had fallen, but no, it wasn&#x27;t there.
 After a few nslookup and other command, started to see some failure.
 The problem ? Our head office had migrated it&#x27;s DNS servers to AWS and apparently had forgotten to move one or more VMs (Or other things).
 The result ? All the company&#x27;s national MPLS had no connection to the internal service and beyond.
 Have a coffee everyone, today is going to be a long journey.

                              <span>I&#x27;m spinning up an RDS arm with FSLogix containers. Strange thing is occurring though - on first login (before FSLogix VHD creation) the user&#x27;s fine, start menu functions as you&#x27;d expect. Log off and back on, Start menu opens, but completely devoid of any tiles, applications, or anything - aside from &#x27;Settings&#x27; &amp; &#x27;Windows Security&#x27;.
 Killing the explorer.exe process as the user, then respawning it brings everything back to as it should be. Can&#x27;t see anything in the FSLogix logs pointing to this.
 The stranger thing is, the exact same policies on our Citrix shared desktop OU works perfectly fine.
 In both cases (RDS farm &amp; Citrix shared desktops) we&#x27;re running server 2022.
 Anyone have any ideas?

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 Having a bit of trouble with printer sharing on around 15 of our desktops running Win10.
 They have specialist USB thermal printers plugged into them and all working fine as local printers. However I need to be able to print to those from other desktops. I have shared the printers from each PC but something is still stopping them from being visible to the network. Are there any other places in Windows 10 that printer or network visibility could be turned off other than Control Panel -&gt; Network and Sharing -&gt; Advanced Sharing Settings ?
 Many Thanks!!!!

                              <span>We have a problem where email being sent from our smarthost is being caught as spam/junk in the recipient&#x27;s Gmail. We&#x27;ve put an exception on the transport rule so if the recipient is gmail.com then to route outside of the connector as outside of organization. This won&#x27;t work for Workspace users as their domain could be anything. Is there anyway you can think of that could do some type of bypass - maybe some type of IP range?
 Our email filtering provider is aware and are working towards this but we don&#x27;t want to drop the send connector entirely as we then lose tracking of our outbound messages in the portal they provide us with.

We would only be doing 500-1000 seals a year. I have approached two certificate companies and I have been quoted £5000 to set up a certificate and I think this is a lot of money, and I&#x27;m not sure if the certificate companies understand the requirements.
 I&#x27;m just wondering if anyone has set up a seal and how they set up the the certificate etc. Any help appreciated

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m trying to implement LAPS, following the steps in this website
 When I try to set the Set-AdmPwdResetPasswordPermission, I&#x27;m getting a:
  
Set-AdmPwdResetPasswordPermission : No such object foundAt line:1 char:1+ Set-AdmPwdResetPasswordPermission -OrgUnit &quot;Laptops&quot; -AllowedPrincipa ...+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+ CategoryInfo : NotSpecified: (:) [Set-AdmPwdResetPasswordPermission], DirectoryOperationException+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : System.DirectoryServices.Protocols.DirectoryOperationException,AdmPwd.PS.DelegateResetPasswordPermission
  
I did some searching and it looks like the OU, or the security group cannot be found.
 To make sure that I&#x27;m using an OU and a security group that actually do exist, I created a little script:
 $ouName &#x3D; &quot;Laptops&quot; $ou &#x3D; Get-ADOrganizationalUnit -Filter {Name -eq $ouName} $ouDN &#x3D; $ou.DistinguishedName $ouDN $groupName &#x3D; &quot;*supportdesk*&quot; $group &#x3D; Get-ADGroup -Filter {Name -like $groupName} -Properties CN $groupCN &#x3D; $group.CN $groupCN #Set permissions with Set-AdmPwdResetPasswordPermission Set-AdmPwdResetPasswordPermission -OrgUnit $ouDN -AllowedPrincipals $groupCN 
 The output of the variables is as expected, but I&#x27;m still getting the error
 What could this be?
 Edit: Formatting

                              <span>Hi team. Just wondering how IT departments control network documentation? I&#x27;m run a team of 3 and we have documentation all over the place. I&#x27;ve looked at IT glue but it seems expensive and more directed towards a MSP rather than a singe IT department. What other option/solutions to administer use?

 I did not tick the &quot;Read only&quot; option.

 The problem is I am not well-versed with Linux. 
 And almost all are Linux based servers.

 &quot;this is the Proxy Server.&quot; 
 &quot;This is the authentication server.&quot;

 &quot;This is a DB server for tests, etc&quot; 
 &quot;This is our monitoring server&quot;

 Actually helps a lot that I got the admin accounts of all these servers so I can freely see what&#x27;s inside in each server.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), and the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) in response to cyber threat actors leveraging newly identified Truebot malware variants against organizations in the United States and Canada. As recently as May 31, 2023, the authoring organizations have observed an increase in cyber threat actors using new malware variants of Truebot (also known as Silence.Downloader). Truebot is a botnet that has been used by malicious cyber groups like CL0P Ransomware Gang to collect and exfiltrate information from its target victims.

                              <span>Got a call from the support team that someone couldn’t print in China from our US based ERP system. I looked, and there are no errors, and the system says it printed fine. User complains that nothing showed up. They confirmed the IP of the printer, and said it was printing other stuff fine. First thing I do is ping it. No response. Then I find out they shut all the equipment down at night, including all the printers. Ok, I can’t diagnose what I can’t connect to. They leave the printer up, and I take the time to send a printout and trace it through the output server and watch it route to China with no error. The next day they say there is no output.
 I logged into the HP print server page, and there is nothing showing an error, except the toner is at 5%. I type up a ‘hello world’ in notepad, hook up my window desktop to it, and print. No errors. I follow it immediately with another server print.
 Just heard from them that nothing showed up. Neither document. At this point, I’m going all Det. Murtaugh and saying “I’m too old for this shit.” Dumping it back on the support team. If windows won’t print to it, let desktop support take it. I’ m out. Let them prove to me the printer they are looking at is the one they told me. There’s probably a pile of output sitting on someone’s printer 3 buildings over.

 I told him to ask her what she does with her mobile phone every time it runs out of charge, does she replace a new phone every day?
 ​
 I&#x27;m so glad I&#x27;m not in support anymore.

                              <span>Recently we were faced with a renewal issue with Citrix. Short version is a rep from Citrix said we had to renew through a var. We received quote directly from Citrix through the portal. The var we use contacted the Citrix rep and passed down a quote to us around 8k more than direct quote from Citrix. After weeks of back and forth, the citrix rep gave a cryptic answer and ghosted both the var and us. I went ahead and process through the portal with PO#. Citrix sent renewal confirmation with renewed certificates and keys that expire 2024. Invoice is now sent as well. Just for anyone that may run into this, challenge it and see if you can keep costs down. What a sketchy company this has turned into. The end is near I am afraid administering Citrix for over 20 years now.

                              <span>I&#x27;m currently working on deploying web applications in an environment that has a mix of docker containers and Apache Virtual Hosts with using Nginx as a proxy for the docker containers (currently). I&#x27;ve been trying to do research on which is the best option for deploying at an organization.
 What is the industry standard/common approach for hosting web applications? Is there a best approach? Or is it dependent on use case? What would be the use cast for each approach?
 Similar with web applications, what is a better approach with databases? Having multiple docker containers for hosting databases for redundancy or deploying database replication (MySQL master-slave replication)?

                              <span>Woke up today to “We had a power outage and one of the servers didn’t come back online.”
 Remoted in and TrueNAS server is down. This is critical to their operations and gets the highest priority. Customer said “When I press the power button, the server doesn’t turn on like everything else”
 I built this server personally using a Dell Poweredge R710, Perc H310 in HBA mode. 
 Fortunately I have spares, I took the staging server were were going to use to deploy an exchange upgrade and brought it with me.
 Went on-site, the power supply LED’s were on, pressed the power button and, nothing, pressed the blue light indicator and nothing, must be a bad motherboard. Since it would be much easier and faster to move the HBA and hard drives to the other server then it would be to replace the motherboard, that’s what I did.
 I didn’t move the processors or the RAM. The replacement server has 32GB of RAM and faster processors, so that’s fine (more than overkill) for a NAS.
 After the swap I reconfigured the BIOS, and the server came right up, added the Static IP and bingo, everything is back online, total time from initial call to completed server replacement 3 hours. 
 I’m feeling pretty great right now. Customer was off today, the end users won’t even know what happened.
 This is how smooth a “disaster” should be. When you’re prepared, even a server failure is piece of cake.
 Now it’s only 1:00 PM and I can enjoy the rest of the holiday.

                              <span>Hi,
 Just going through a network refresh and I&#x27;m currently at slight impasse as to whether to hardwire or go for high density wireless for our user devices. (Exclusively laptops and phones)
 As it stands today we&#x27;re a pretty heady mix of 30% wireless and 70% wired spread across 10 locations and 400 users. As of today all laptop docks have a CAT5 to them and everything else is wireless.
 Is there any good reason why we shouldn&#x27;t go 100% wireless if it is designed properly?

 I&#x27;m going to have to do a small report and just want to make sure what I say is correct. Without the TPM or recovery key, the data on the drive will be unreadable to whoever stole it correct?

 We didn&#x27;t implement this change, it was done by the HR and marketing department. However, the careers subdomain (careers.dantasticscompany.com) is not accessible when on the internal network.
 Off-site, the website works fine.
 If I run nslookup, I get &quot;DC can&#x27;t find careers.dantasticscompany.com: Non-existent domain&quot;.
 I have multiple sites running this same format (careers.*.com) and none of them are having the same issue.
 Any ideas where I can go with this moving forward?
 Is it DNS? It&#x27;s always DNS!

                              <span>TL/DR - what do you think people without tech/IT/etc knowledge think you do for work?
 As the 4th of July holiday in the US brings people and families together I always run into the “so what do you actually do” type questions but I never feel people really get it even from a high level. 
 My basic spiel as a network engineer is “when you use the internet your phone is connecting to something like Netflix for instance, Netflix uses tons of servers so everyone can watch at the same time, these servers are in data centers which are huge buildings filled with servers. These servers need to connect to the internet so you can use them, I make sure these connections all work fast and for 1000s of devices”
 Really the launching point of this question is someone in my family equated data center with warehouse which made them think I was basically moving around boxes. This prompted them to ask if I was a manager or warehouse manager and when I said no they said that our other relative could put a good word in at the candy factory they work at that I should consider it. 
 I understand not knowing the ins and outs of a job because most people don’t know that for most jobs but to not even have a high level concept of it was a bit mind boggling especially since they equated it to something very random. 
 So how does everyone else explain what they do to non-tech/IT/etc folks and more importantly do people actually understand at all?

                              <span>Everywhere I read that using Bitlocker with a TPM + PIN/PASSWORD is supposed more secure than using it with a password with no TPM. Why exactly is that?
 If we assume that Bitlocker itself has no vulnerabilities and is properly implemented, I don&#x27;t see any way to crack it, assuming a secure password was used, which to my knowledge is not the case with the TPM. The way I see it, the TPM gives an additional attack vector, since the keys are stored in the TPM and someone might find a way to extract them.
 I would very much like to hear your opinion on this.

                              <span>We have some Surface Laptop SEs deployed out and for whatever reason when they’re left turned off for a week or so they lose the time. I’ve done some testing and found that when they’re shut down and turned back on again they always come back with the time when you shut them down as the UEFI clock seems to go off. But they never seem to attempt to sync the time and if they do it’s sporadic at best. Has anyone else had any similar issues with these Surfaces or with Intune only devices?

                              <span>I&#x27;m new to being a System Administrator and I&#x27;m practically the lone IT personnel at my company.
 Our ISP currently emails their bills to me as It was my email that was used during the application, because of that it falls under me to print and forward the billing statements in-person to the accounting team.
 My email is the admin email of their Google Workspace (on the way to migrating to Office 365 in about a few months), I&#x27;m currently thinking of a way to make my life easier by having the billing statements just pop into the accounting team&#x27;s inboxes instead of relying on me to hand it to them (also means I don&#x27;t have to worry about giving it late due to being busy).
 I&#x27;m kinda back and forthing with how I&#x27;m suppose to be approaching this. I would assume that the ISP (or any company that offers subscription based billing) would only take in 1 email as their main point of contact for the company. So I&#x27;m having a hard time figuring out a way to delegate those billing emails through distribution lists or shared mailboxes.
 I would like to be enlightened on how stuff like these usually goes for other companies. I get that my email was used because I am the SysAd and will be the ISP&#x27;s point of contact but I&#x27;m pretty sure the billing shouldn&#x27;t be put into my inboxes no?
 In addition how should emails be setup if there would be another SysAd personnel added, how would that work out?

                              <span>Hi, Tech Wizards of Reddit!
 Probably a simple query but not something I have come across before.
 We operate one of our tenants on Microsoft 365, in which we have 3 domains.
 There has always been a main/default domain to which users are set when created, however last week a handful of users has their default domain changed, seemingly randomly.
 Some users received a pop-up in outlook asking to restart as the exchange admin has made a change.
 Is there a best way to check why this happened?
 I was looking through the audit page however non of the parameters seemed correct in this scenario.
 Cheers, all!

 Do you have such a system implemented in your company? Is it a software or what?
 I was wondering: can it be done using O365?

 We have a third party with which we integrate that sent us a CSR. From what I understand the CSR on their side is created with their private key?
 We then receive the CSR and we sign it with our CA certificate (i assume this means with the public key of this certificate), this creates a certificate that we send back to them and then they use to connect to us. Is this the correct way to do mTLS?

                              <span>We are beginning to slowly roll out Windows 11 to users, and I mean slowly. Basically, we have only a few IT staff, myself included, that have them. The IT staff all have secondary admin accounts that have admin access to their laptops, these are also active directory accounts. 
 Now for the issue, we all WFH at least three days a week which is great. However, there seems to be an issue with Windows 11 caching the credentials for our standard accounts. Let&#x27;s say I work from the office on Monday, on Tuesday morning I can turn on my laptop at home and log in with my standard account just fine and connect to the VPN and work the entire day without issue. At the end of the day, I disconnect from the VPN and shut down my laptop or maybe I just lock it after disconnecting as I will be using it the next day (this is the most common). The next morning when I attempt to log on I receive the message that I cannot be logged in because my domain cannot be reached. The following is the process I have to go through to get logged in with my standard account.
 Log in with my admin account (for some reason this works just fine off the network, most likely due to being a local admin account)
 Connect to the VPN while logged in with my admin account
 Switch user and log in with my standard account
 Once logged in with my standard account, reboot the laptop, log back in with my standard account, reconnect to the VPN, and begin my day.
 This was not an issue on previous Windows 10 and 7 laptops so I am not sure what is causing this on 11, and it seems like it has gotten worse with recent updates. Has anyone else seen this and found a fix?

                              <span>I raised a case with Mimecast support querying whether there was some kind of wider DDoS against Mimecast going on between 14th May and 9th June, but they neither confirmed nor denied anything so thought I&#x27;d ask the community.
 We received our Monthly Account Assessment over the weekend and noticed an abnormally high number of inbound rejections towards the beginning of the month. Looking back at the same report for May we can see these started on 14th May. Normal daily inbound email values for us are around 10,000 and we can see these hitting 100,000+ through this period.
 Having dug into the rejections deeper using the info within Reporting -&gt; CSV in the Mimecast portal it reads like a DDoS attack with multiple source IP addresses and randomised FROM addresses. The TO addresses are also randomised, so it doesn’t seem like a targeted attack from that point of view.
 Our main concern is that the TO domains extend to all our domains within both our Mimecast and 365 tenant, some of which are not in the wild as such and would normally see very few inbound emails. It’s as though someone had a complete list of our domains and sent high amounts of email to randomised addresses in a DoS attempt. Mimecast did its thing as these were rejected due to the sending IPs being in RBLs.
 We’re trying to determine whether this was unique to our organisation or whether Mimecast customers as a whole were targeted.
 Did anyone else experience this at all?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hi folks! I&#x27;ve been using hexnode UEM to manage our endpoints for quite some time. Any thoughts on this would be appreciated. 
 To detect whether a hexnode device is viewing a web app we can use URL parameter wildcards which inject device variables like so:https://www.hexnode.com/mobile-device-management/help/pass-device-information-from-hexnode-to-the-web-apps-added-in-the-device-through-wildcards-faqs/
 For example, we could use the wildcard to check against the UDID of a device to determine if a client is a hexnode device and its location. But what if the UDID was to be leaked, anyone could just enter the UDID string and access the web app as that device. 
 My question is how can we implement secure authentication for devices accessing web apps to prevent unauthorized access?

I believe this has been set up incorrectly as users can&#x27;t sign in from sister tenant, but before I start trying to work out what is wrong I want to know if I&#x27;m chasing herrings. 
 So, does Kallidus support SSO for external users in AZAD?

                              <span>Hello, r/sysadmin community! 
 I&#x27;m currently working on a research paper titled &quot;A Payload-Based Malicious HTTP Traffic Detection Method Using Transfer Semi-Supervised Learning.&quot; However, I&#x27;m encountering difficulties in finding a suitable dataset for my study. I was wondering if any of you could lend me a hand or provide some guidance.
 Specifically, I&#x27;m looking for a dataset that consists of payload-based HTTP traffic, classified as either malicious or not malicious. While I have come across datasets that focus on URL-based data, my research specifically requires payload data. If anyone knows of any existing datasets that fit this criterion, I would greatly appreciate any information or links you can provide.
 Alternatively, if there isn&#x27;t a readily available dataset, I would be more than willing to create my own dataset by classifying payload data myself. If any of you have access to a collection of payload data or any logs or know of any resources where I could find such data, I would be extremely grateful. I couldn&#x27;t find it on Kaggle.
 Thank you in advance for your time and support. I look forward to hearing from this knowledgeable community!

 1: Configure the home page URL - string - [(&quot;website.name.here&quot;)]
 2: Block access to a list of URLs - string - [(&quot;*&quot;)]
 3: Allow access to a list of URLs - string - [(&quot;website.name.here&quot;)]
 It&#x27;s assigned to the correct group and shows a successful install status. All other configuration policies are working correctly, including Managed Home, WiFi restrictions, exit kiosk, etc..
 It just seems to be the Chrome restrictions.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Hi All,
 We are looking at changing legacy HDDs on our campus systems for above 1,000 Windows systems to an SSD or NVMe drive as their primary drive. The systems currently have individual data of each of our organization members&#x27; company user profiles along with maybe secondary HDDs of sizes varying from 500GB-2TB. We would only expect to move the primary drive which is usually no more than 1TB in size, average is 500GB.
 As this will be a large task for our small team to migrate the data from the existing drive to a new drive-through normal (home user) imaging tools the work is expected to take a few weeks or months to complete for all 1000 systems. 
 A few considerations we are still uncertain on:
  
If any suggestions on professional imaging tools are there for moving the content from the old (HDD) physical drive to the new (SSD) drive that can give us a rollout of maybe 100 systems per day over network backup/restore imaging methods then we can consider this. Have any approached something like this procedure before?
 If we are buying the SSDs in bulk as all the same model and capacity, we should not expect much fuss from Windows OS in the hardware imaging process as no other components (like motherboard, GPU, etc.) are being changed right?
 Should we expect potential data loss from bad sectors in existing HDDs being cloned to SSDs, maybe OS blue screen errors as the data might not be perfect in the old HDD?
 Any other precautions we should expect if we plan to do this in-house?
  
We are considering outsourcing this task to a vendor for fixed SLAs and agreements and having our users up and running in a known timeline with the least amount of downtime. I am not sure whether they will have data loss in their contract.
 Let me know what you think is the best approach here.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;ve got a little problem with NM.
 I wrote a script and putted to /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/ folder. I&#x27;ve added chmod +x and restarted the NM service.
 The script is for testing purpose because i want to add a little more after that will work.
 #!/bin/bash echo &quot;TEST | iface $1 state is $2&quot; &gt;&gt; /var/log/iface.log 
 And now, the NM reacts only when i deactivated device using for example a nmtui tool, then i&#x27;ve got in logs down and up state. But it doesnt react when i unplug the cable or put that interface manually down using ifconfig iface down. The NetworkManager-dispatcher should invoke for a while when something happend with ifaces but nothing really happend and serivce says it&#x27;s dead. But when i deactivate interface using nmtui it&#x27;s works fine and Active state for a while.
 Could someone could help me with that? I&#x27;ve read a lot of website and even ask chat gpt but response was &#x27;check the script, check the status of NM, restart NM&#x27; which doesnt helped at all.
 Edit: Oh, i forgot to mention that i use Redhat.

                              <span>Does anyone have advice on how to handle ... difficult customers. Especailly when that particular customer is top of the food chain?
 I have one of the directors complaining at me regularly about how things just dont work and how it used to be better (before I showed up and &#x27;changed everything&#x27;)
 The things he like to complain about is MS Teams for starters, sharepoint, onedrive etc. He also has trouble with different headsets/speakers/devices any time theres a meeting and its somehow my fault too. A website I have nothing to do with was &#x27;hanging&#x27; today and thats also my problem or the fualt of the brand new high spec laptop that was issued to him a month or so ago. Even things like searching for email being a pain in the outlook client (doesnt seem to search archived items) but working fine in OWA. 
 I think he just likes to complain, and im happy to stand and fight my corner, the other 100+ employees have no trouble, but this guy is impatient and unwilling to learn. Its frustrating to deal with, as much as its frustrating for him to feel like hes being held up by these technologies.
 I guess i dont know what im asking and am venting as much as anything else... does anyone else deal with this? Im lucky in that I dont repot to this guy, I think id have left pretty sharpish if that was the case.

 Something strange happened just now.
 About 100 user accounts was locked out by our on-prem Exchange 2013 server. I check the eventlog 4740 on our primary DC and found around 100 entries from the exact same time, down to the second. All different users but with the Exchange 2013 server as &quot;Caller Computer Name&quot;.
 It&#x27;s a hybrid setup with Exchange Online. External mail flows through the on-prem Exchange to and from ExO.
 I don&#x27;t even know where to start looking?! Help!

                              <span>Hi,
 We have been managing multiple domains. There is no any trust relationship between domains. 
 - Not Enabled DNS Publish
 - Already activated 2022 KMS Key on 2019 OS Server (installed latest patch)
 - Joined KMS machine into domainA.local
 Already opened TCP 1688 port.
 I am using use the (Key Management Service (KMS)). NOT Active-Directory based activation.
 My question is : 
 1 - For testing purposes, I have installed fresh 2022 OS machine (WORKGROUP). Later I have ran those command like below.
 slmgr /skms KMS_Server_IP_Address:1688
 slmgr /ato
 As you can see attachment , I am getting a output for SLMGR /XPR is it normal ? it writing expiry time : 12/31/2023. 
 Will it cause any problems with activation?
 ​
 Screenshot : https://imgur.com/a/F5FhHOx 
 2 - I have been using VM machines. sometimes I am changing hardware for VMs such as CPU and/or RAM increase. Will it cause any problems with activation?
 3 - Also , I can&#x27;t see my test 2022 machine inside VAMT Tool. How can I get report?
 thanks,

                              <span>Due to compliance reasons we need to have separate accounts for managing our Domains \ DNS for our technical and accounts users. I&#x27;m finding it really hard to find any decent enterprise grade registrars that will actually allow you to have multiple accounts with different levels of permissions.
 ​
 Does anyone have any recommendations? We had been recommended to use hostinger but this does not do what we need it to because you can set up multiple users but you can&#x27;t actually view billing \ account info separately from the main account which doesn&#x27;t fit our needs.
 ​
 Any suggestions?

 Is there a way to have the printer spooler service restart when print jobs fail and are not removed from the printing que? I&#x27;ve found some scripts to restart the spooler service on a time interval, but I&#x27;m afraid restarting it might interrupt a current print job, which would be unfortunate. 
 I was thinking, can I trigger a batch file with task planner on an event ID that is a failed print job or something? Also if anyone has any good suggestions I&#x27;m all ears!
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Hey guys,
 ​
 One of our customers asked us the question to export his &#x27;Projects&#x27; Public Folders from Exchange Online. I thought it should be peanuts to do, but of course he couldn&#x27;t make it too easy.
 Underneath the Projects folder we have 276 seperate folders, one for each project.
 What the customer wants is that we export each direct subfolder into a separate PST file. To make it more clear let&#x27;s say we have &#x27;Project A&#x27;, &#x27;Project B&#x27;, &#x27;Project C&#x27; folders. They sit directly under the &#x27;Projects&#x27; PF. What the customer doesn&#x27;t want is to have a &#x27;ProjectS.pst&#x27; file from which he could scroll through the folder hierarchy, no. What he wants is to have a pst-file for &#x27;Project A.pst&#x27;, &#x27;Project B.pst&#x27;, which only opens the folder structure he needs at that moment.
 Do you guys have any ideas? I came up to a lot of shady-looking tools and tested some of them, but most of them are unable to export the public folders the way I want it.
 ​
 Thanks in advance for any advices.

                              <span>Hello everyone!
 Long time lurker of this subreddit, finally got a job offer for a sysadmin role, yay!
 After working in HelpDesk for 3 years, I wanted to get more techy and start managing the stuff by myself.
 From those who went from HelpDesk to Sysadmin, how was the step? Was it a difficult one? I’m really excited for this because I’ll be the only IT there (there’s one other guy who has been managing their stuff there, but always with external support). 
 They want to start doing things the proper way, deploying a decent infrastructure and I also have to do a bit of user support, but that’s not an issue.
 Any tips are appreciated!
 Sorry for the format but I’m on mobile :(

                              <span>Hello, I&#x27;m having a wired issue where one of my colleagues cannot send emails to one domain. We are using Office365 and SPF record is valid (checked on mxtoolbox.com) and has the &quot;include:spf.protection.outlook.com&quot;
 All other mails are working so i don&#x27;t think is on our end. 
 Any clue on how to debug?

                              <span>Hi,
 we are starting to create some security monitoring and starting with analyzing the windows eventlogs. We see a very large sice of logs with &quot;login type 3&quot;, the network login events. 
 Does anybody know if i can filter this event that is does not create a windows eventlog entry? Otherweise how do you mange this problem in your security monitoring?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi All
 We haven&#x27;t made any big changes to our spam policies, however, now emails that are being classed as &#x27;spam&#x27; by Exchange online, are being delivered to people&#x27;s inboxes.
 Message trace states that its been delivered to the junk folder, but we know otherwise that its not the case
 Does anyone with the same issue even know where to BEGIN looking? Unsure if its Microsoft having an oopsie..
 Thanks

 Is there a way to do this in Azure AD?

                              <span>Hey friends, just finished building a PC for a client and installed Windows 11. I wanted to join it to Azure AD by default. However, even though the PC was freshly installed with unused hardware, it&#x27;s telling me that it&#x27;s already registered, which it&#x27;s not according to the Azure Admin Center, by the way. I&#x27;ve encountered this issue before and was able to solve it by deleting reg keys. Unfortunately, that didn&#x27;t work this time. Any of you have any ideas?

 This is on a Win 11 enterprise device.
 Any ideas?

 Hope remains, barely. Brand new company has their Operations Director handling new employee equipment purchases. We don&#x27;t have any IT resources. CEO wants to buy Apple machines from Costco and roll with the punches. I know enough to know that&#x27;s not the greatest idea considering our industry. Attempt to setup equipment bundle + MDM services through crappy CSP. Too late... Pick between having the (2, just 2 macOS) assets in hand by new employee start date or pre-configured and late. I choose the former.
 New employees start Wednesday. Assets in hand today. Great, I&#x27;ve got one whole day one workday and one holiday to figure this out. I used to help Mom re-image school laptops. I can do this.
 My plan: Setup MDM through Intune + Autopilot, which can handle both Window…</span>

                              <span>When it comes to network automation, how do you handle what kinds of accounts run a given but if automation?
 For example, say I want to use some automation to push a config update with netmiko to 10 devices. I could use my individual credentials to runn that and connect to the devices. However, what if I want to run some other automation like grabbing config backups or collecting the status of various network devices at regular intervals?
 There comes this debate of always using individual credentials vs having a non-user/master account. A master account can be very useful, but I get the feeling some people get turned off by this and view it as a security risk.
 How do you navigate this in your automation? Is every bit if automation run individually by each employee, or do you have non-user specific accounts that are used to connect and authenticate to things? (If the later, how is security handled)

 eno1 is the WAN and also the default gateway for my ubuntu server. Wireguard clients could connect to eno1&#x27;s public ip, no problems there. enx001e101f0000 is an LTE modem, all wireguard client should use this as their default gateway. I&#x27;ve added the following to my wg0.conf PostUp &#x3D; iptables -A FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o enx001e101f0000 -j MASQUERADE PostDown &#x3D; iptables -D FORWARD -i wg0 -j ACCEPT; iptables -t nat -D POSTROUTING -o enx001e101f0000 -j MASQUERADE My clients can ping the LTE modems ip, but can&#x27;t ping 8.8.8.8. Error: No route to host. I think that ubuntu is somehow still trying to push traffic out of eno0.

                              <span>Hi all. I’m a beginner sysadmin . Hope you can give me some good hint. My company asked me evaluate the feasibility of a wifi network with a landing page that asks for auth with email and password.
 I want the employees to log in with user and psw using a simple webpage and then, if ok, start using the network.
 If I understand well, to implement all of this you can use Captive Portal authentication (that includes WAPs and a WLC with a RADIUS server for authentication).I searched for WAPs/WLCs and read some manual but can’t decide what to use. I don&#x27;t have Active Directory. Can you please suggest me:
  
some WAP/WLC that is all-in-one with a RADIUS server and is good, affordable in your experience;
 or some good, trusted, affordable WAP that can use RADIUS installed on a PC, that is not too complicated to configure (in this case the server is acting as WLC I think)?Thank you very much and sry for the confusion.

 I&#x27;ll provide more detail as required however currently we&#x27;ve got got two tenants running on this SBC. The default tenant uses the inbound public IP:Port 88.88.88.88:5061 and the 2nd Tenant uses 88.88.88.88:5062 (the public ip is made up obs :) )
 For 5061- Tenant 1:
 When making a call from teams the Teams SIP proxy with souce FQDN sip.pstnhub.microsoft.com sends an INVITE packet to the SBC and advertises the IP it wants you to connect voice data on. The SBC does it&#x27;s magic with the local PSTN trunk and eventually replies with a 183 Session progress packet to the Microsoft SIP proxy telling it to send voice packets to the public IP:Port 88.88.88.88:5061. Microsft acknowledges this and then sends another invite packet to start the call. The call works
 For 5062 Tenant 2:

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been on the hunt for a cellular modem/media converter for use with an existing firewall as a backup circuit. So far, for just a modem/media converter-type device, I&#x27;ve only been finding devices with USB ports, but I need an ethernet port. Ideally, it would be 5G compatible, but I don&#x27;t need mmwave since this is for a more rural site. That said, I won&#x27;t turn down mmwave-compatible devices.
 Normally, for a small/mobile site, I&#x27;d grab a Cradlepoint or maybe a Pepwave and be done, but I need to integrate with an existing firewall that only has ethernet wan interfaces. I&#x27;m hoping for the existing firewall to get the public IP from the cellular network so I don&#x27;t have to worry about extra routing or double-NATting. Any suggestions?

I&#x27;m trying to get a single Palo Alto VM Series running in Azure, and I know Palo&#x27;s pretty well but my Azure skills come and go as I don&#x27;t use it all the time so I&#x27;m trying to get past the cloud specific nuances to be able to hit the mgmt IP via HTTPS and get to the normal firewall config stuff. I do understand azure basics like VNET&#x27;s related to Subnet&#x27;s which associate to Route tables and how UDR&#x27;s are needed often times or inter-vnet connections, etc.
 My main issue is when I went to deploy the NGFW this time in Azure, I only have public subnet, Private subnet, and public IP. I remember and see in older documentation there was a management subnet to configure as well but I don&#x27;t see that currently when configuring one.
 So my question is.... given the context that I just want to get a basic Palo up and running and reach it via mgmt.... not even worried about the nat stuff or data plane route tables and whatnot in azure yet..... what is the easiest method to do this? I can&#x27;t seem to find a good guide or video on it... and I know it shouldn&#x27;t be a process that technically needs one anyway, simple concept but I&#x27;m just not sure what to do next. Any help is appreciated and will be gifted with all the upvotes I have to gift. No gold because I&#x27;m mad about the API changes killing my RIF app though.
 ​
 Edit: and for the record if the public IP is what I&#x27;m supposed to be hitting, no dice currently, and there&#x27;s no NSG associated with it.... if that public IP is the answer..... maybe I need to figure out how it relates to a route table and make a 0.0.0.0/0 to internet or something. but anyway, point still stands... I M Noob today.

                              <span>One of our buildings on campus is going to be part of an arts event with projections going onto the building, synchronised with music coming from speaker stacks etc.
 This is a longstanding event happening every couple of years, but new this year, is a live element, rather than everything being pre-recorded, so they need an internet connection delivering to their (temporary) control location.
 Logically, I think we&#x27;re sorted, chuck them in the guest VRF, new VLAN, and some basic firewall rules, but physically it&#x27;s going to be an area we don&#x27;t have much experience in, and I&#x27;m looking for any advice from anyone who&#x27;s done similar?
 It&#x27;s temporary, so any changes to building fabric are ruled out (e.g. nobody&#x27;s going to be getting Estates dept. out with a drill.)
 Their kit doesn&#x27;t support WiFi, but would do 4/5G. We&#x27;re ruling that out due to signal strength being poor in the location at the best of times, and once you add in a significant audience, we wouldn&#x27;t want to rely on it.
 They&#x27;re approx. 50m from a nearby building, so we&#x27;re probably within spec to just run a long piece of Cat6A through the window from an existing data point, but this cable will need to share containment with mains power (240V/50Hz), and so I think there may be both technical and regulatory issues with this? I don&#x27;t want this to fail an electrical inspection just before the event and lead us to have to frantically replan.
 My two main thoughts are fibre from an existing switch in a ground floor room, or P2P Wireless, with a preference for fibre (for cost reasons as we&#x27;ll always re-use SFP modules and switches, but P2P kit is less likely to find any future use for us.)
 Has anyone done anything similar?
 If fibre is the answer, what level of armouring/ruggedising is necessary? This will be in a publicly accessible area with kids running around etc.
 Event isn&#x27;t until much later in the year, but I&#x27;d rather have everything planned, purchased and tested well ahead of time.

 I&#x27;m aware of the above security features on access switches; however, if I spoof my mac-address and use the matching IP on the ARP table, I cannot see how these features can prevent any attack since they only look to the mac-address and IP.

 Am I wrong? Please comment.

                              <span>Need some tips from my RF pals.
 I have a few customers in a rural location that are experiencing issues with downstream errors and lost syncs but I can&#x27;t figure out why. Each node is an 8x4 DOCSIS 3.0 setup.
 One customer in particular reports issues with lag spikes and disconnects throughout the day. I did some troubleshooting, their modem is receiving about -2dB on the DS and TX is about +35dB. Return SNR on the node is ~30dB. I did a constellation on each of the DS channels from the customer modem and I didn&#x27;t see any obvious issues. No blurring or DC offset etc. The modem itself is consistently reporting ~ 0.05% error rate across all of the downstream channels, and has logged a bunch of timeouts and lost syncs over the past few days. 
 My techs did a sweep of the area and didn&#x27;t find any obvious issues. No damaged lines, taps, etc. This customer&#x27;s tap and drop are brand new. No splits or any other devices in the home, just the cable modem. We&#x27;ve finally had some steady temperatures over the past few weeks so levels have been well within the AGC window overnight. 
 Any ideas? My next step is to try a different cable port or line card on my CMTS, but not everyone on that node is having the same issue.

                              <span>Hello fellow Redditors,
 I noticed that there is no dedicated Barracuda subreddit to post this in, but there seems a to be an aweful lot of people having experiences with this glorified linux boxes.
 I come from a Fortinet background, but have used Barracuda to prepare for my exams in previous years. Currently i have the task to take a json file from the interweb, extract a certain portion of ip addresses and get them into one of Barracuda&#x27;s 4 CustomExternalObjects.
 Technicalities:
  
Hardware: Barracuda F82 Annex-B Revision A
 Firmware: 9.0.0-0511
 License status: Unlicensed, DEMO mode
  
Achievements so far:
  
Writing a python3 script that downloads a json file with ip addresses from the web (script can be provided if someone finds it useful)
 Parsing the json and getting rid of duplicates
 Writing the final IP list to a file with one CIDR entry in each line
  
Where i fail:
  
Using /var/phion/bin/CustomExternalAddrImport to import those CIDR IPs into the CustomExternalObject
 The command runs without errors (no message in linux is usually a good message)
 The address file disappears, but the Firewall Admin shows me an empty list
  
Questions:
  
Has anyone done this successfully on a newer firmware build?
 Are there any logs i could plow through? A quick check showed me no signs of command execution logging.
  
Thank you in advance

 (General Kenobi!)
 I&#x27;m preparing to install around 20 Cisco C9130AXI APs in a branch office. The objective is to replace an old 2504 WLC with the Embedded WLC solution. In this case, the WLC is located locally, but since it resides on one of the APs, I&#x27;m wondering if utilizing the FlexConnect mode will result in greater throughput compared to running the APs in Local mode. In Local mode, the connection to the Embedded WLC-AP becomes the bottleneck, is that correct?
 Thanks for your help!

 ​
 I have a pair of Nexus 5596 that are EoL but we have extended support on them through a 3rd party.
 Recently I have needed to run BGP on them so I enabled the trial to get us going and it seems that we will be needing this feature indefinitely. 
 My problem is, after contacting Cisco about purchasing the LAN enterprise license, I was told that I&#x27;m SOL because it&#x27;s EoL and told to buy a new switches. 
 What are my options here? The grace period ends in about 20 days and I would like to continue using BGP on these cores as the other end only supports BGP. After looking it doesn&#x27;t appear you can reactivate the trail (worth a look eh?).
 Thanks!

 We know the fibre links are working (we can shine a torch through and get light at the other end). We can swap connections and the fibre / transceivers go live. But I cant get both operational at the same time.
 Going show spanning-tree blockedports doesnt show any ports held down. Doing show int breif shows the links are down, doing a no shut doesnt fix it.
 Configs * The configuration is the same for all the switches, except the STP priority &amp; the associated physical ports for the links * Switch A to B works * Switch A to C w…</span>

                              <span>Question: When pinging to devices via ping from the switch, there is no request time out at all, but when ping from the source computer, there will be periodic request time out. I try to trace to the destination network both from switch and pc, there will be packets. The packet is lost during the destination network, but I wonder why the switch doesn&#x27;t have request time out intermittently like a PC.

                              <span>Hi all! 
 I originally made a post in ITCQ, but someone DM&#x27;d me and told me to post it here for more traction.
 At the moment, I am currently looking for new opportunities and I was connected with one of the head guys for a Hotel chain that is currently looking for an IT Manager (for five of their hotels) to join in with the small team they have established. The position itself is mainly remote (WFH) as they have one or two other IT guys that are mainly onsite. The only time I have to check in/on the properties and deal with any updates/changes are for extra assistance.
 Those of you who worked in the Hotel IT, or any of the &#x27;travel niche&#x27; side of the business, what are your general thoughts on the industry as a whole? 
 Thank you for your comments in advance!

                              <span>A few weeks ago we started getting reports of certain computers not waking up properly. Upon investigating, my techs found that the computers (Optiplex 7090 micros) would be normal sleep mode, and moving the mouse caused the power light to go solid and the fan to spin up, then... nothing. We got about 10 reports of this, out of a fleet of at least 50 of that model among our branch offices.
 There had been a recent BIOS update, so we tried rolling it back. That seemed to help for one or two boots, then back to the original problem. We pulled one of the computers, gave the employee a loaner, and started a deeper investigation. 
 So many tests. Every power setting in Windows and BIOS. Windows 10 vs Windows 11, M.2 Drives vs SATA, RST vs AHCI, rolling back recent updates... The whiteboard filled up with things we tried. Certain things would seem to work, then the computer would adapt like Borg to a phaser and the wake issue would recur.
 After a clean Windows install, one of my techs noticed that it seemed to only happened when the computer was joined to the domain. We checked into that, and sure enough, that was the case. Ok, a weird policy issue, finally getting somewhere. There was only one policy dealing with power, so we disabled that. No change.
 Finally, we created an Isolation Ward OU, and started adding GPOs one by one. Finally one seemed to be causing the wake issue... but it made no sense. It was a policy that ran a script on shutdown, that logged information to the Description field in Windows- Computer name, serial number, things like that. No power policies, it didn&#x27;t even run on wake.
 We tested it thoroughly, and it seems definitive: A shutdown policy, that runs a script to log a few lines of system information, was causing a wake from sleep issue, but only on a subset of a specific model of a computer.
 My head hurts.

 My company is beginning to look at moving from on-prem exchange to 365. We have just over 500 mail accounts with a 220gb database. I was looking at the migration types available and felt that we would be suitable for a cutover migration. From your experience is this a good route to go? Or should we opt for a hybrid migration.
 Thank you for your time and energy.

 I am looking quite a while for the best Corporate Intranet Solution. Currently we don&#x27;t have one. I wonder if you would go with Sharepoint or is there any way to use Confluence? 
 What I want to implement:
  
Section with links to other online software websites (Xero, Stripe, Marketing Portal)
 Storage with documentation (Company logo, print materials, operating manuals)
 Forum/Group to connect with other Employees (alternative Facebook group)
 Ticketing system for helpdesk
 Task-system to send tasks to the Employees
 Forms (where Employees puts in his monthly KPIs)
  
Open to all ideas in all areas! Any other competitor?

                              <span>We have a process. Tickets come in through support, they get prioritized and picked up by the first available engineer from the correct team. We have projects and planning and all that other stuff that we do. But noooo, along comes some “VIP VP of Customer Success and Handjobs” who ignores the whole thing and ensures no visibility by messaging individual engineers directly with their random low priority but HIGH priority “the customer has been on holiday for five months but wants this work done ASAP” crap. 
 Screw those guys

                              <span>I’m looking for software that can monitor bandwidth between hosts, monitor uptime, networking issues, even down to nfs mounts being unresponsive. 
 I used to use whatsup but that was a long time ago so I’m looking for something more modern. 
 Wanted to know what everyone was using that was popular. Having a cost is okay as long as it works. 
 Thanks

                              <span>I work at a small shop, there are less than 10 of us, and I have sort of become the impromptu desktop engineer, I guess? My main function is desktop support. My predecessor would keep images of each desktop by model and processor. Right now we are using Dell desktops, and HP laptops. I was thinking we really just need to keep maybe 2 images? One for desktop, one for laptops. The desktops are 8th and 9th gen Intel CPUs, where the laptops are 8th to 11th gen Intel CPUs. I am using DISM to apply and capture images, and I sysprep the images. These are all &quot;thin&quot; images, just Windows 10 that was installed on them and decrapified/customized to our liking to get rid of OEM bloatware and keep the image size down. We will add to domain and install SCCM, etc later. Any reason to keep more than one image for each type of hardware/manufacturer? I know sysprep generalizes the image, removing hardware identifiers and such, and Windows 10 is pretty forgiving when it comes to different hardware. I just need to run Updates on the hardware after imaging, which I am already doing, correct? I tried googling this, but maybe not phrasing it correctly and just would like some advice from veterans. TIA!

                              <span>We use one of the big (third-party) email gateways for our O365 environment, so all email coming into our environment has already been checked/filtered before it touches O365. The gateway provider gave us an IP range, and we created an Exchange mail transport rule (priority 0) to set the spam confidence level (SCL) to -1 for anything arriving from that IP range. This works great... except for one user. And this user is complaining quite loudly, all the way up to C-level.
 I just joined this company (SMB), it&#x27;s a small team and everyone but the director has turned over in the past year. Seems a lot of things in this environment are held together with (figurative) glue &amp; duct tape. I&#x27;m trying to approach this problem with a detective mindset as I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s been done before me. What are some things I should check?

 I created an AD group for exemptions to the policy, added that group to the Delegations tab and set the permissions to DENY.
 Users added to the exemptions group are still required to encrypt if they want to write to removable media.
 Is there more required?
 Do I have to apply another policy to overwrite the global GPO?

 I foolishly thought this would be a simple case of asking MS to move it to another region but apparently that&#x27;s not a thing.
 Moving absolutely everything (email, sp, teams) etc with Azad joined computers, apps and who know what else to a brand new tenant, and with the domain to move over too is a massive arse ache of a job, is there a better way?

                              <span>Hi everyone, 
 Is it me or is Intune&#x27;s &quot;Discovered Apps&quot; under Monitor in Endpoint not showing the correct number of PCs that has some specific softwares installed? 
 For example, I know prior that I had approximately 1600 installs for a 2 different softwares and today it is showing only 700 for both. 
 I checked PCs that were not showing on this list manually and they all still have the software.

I don’t see any way to cancel this - do I need to contact the system administrator? I’m not sure what mimecast does except for scan links, but I don’t like the idea that my phone is now enrolled in it.

                              <span>Hi,
 We have activated the previous versions for a share on a server some time ago.
 -Logon is done directly on the server (Windows 2019).
 The previous versions are displayed for me and my college (local admins) until today. (31 versions/snaps)
 For another user (local admin on the server), the previous versions are displayed only until 20.6. (15 versions/snaps)
 Does anyone know this problem?
 Any ideas?
 ​
 Thanks.

                              <span>Is the role of Windows System engineers becoming obsolete? As someone who has been working as a Windows administrator for almost two decades, I can&#x27;t help but feel that the profession is gradually fading away. It seems that the new generation of tech enthusiasts are more drawn to DevOps, leaving traditional system administration behind. While I possess some coding skills and can handle infrastructure management, I have never officially held the title of a DevOps engineer. This raises concerns about the future of infrastructure management using Windows/VMware. Will on-premises solutions eventually become obsolete? Are DevOps professionals simply the new version of system administrators? I apologize for my scattered thoughts, but I am genuinely worried about my relevance in this evolving landscape.

                              <span>Hi, 
 I&#x27;m looking for some recommendation to setting up some security cameras on an UK allotment site, I said I&#x27;d help them out.
 Being an allotment they don&#x27;t have much money budget is 2k max but hoping to do this around 1k if possible. They do not have internet and due to no postcode can not get anything installed, the only power is at the &quot;Office/Shed/Shop&quot;.
 I am famililarwith homelab software and IP cameras but wondering if this is the right solution? It needs to be simple to manage as well as the site managers are mostly retired and not tec savy. It would need to have decent storage 3-7 days rolling recording I think, and mutliple cameras, first thoughts are one on each corner and one inside. Should I use IP cameras and install a wireless router and POE setup or maybe look to use a coaxle setup instead?

 How to do it?

 DESTINATION_DIR&#x3D;&quot;/etc/dhcp-backup&quot;

                              <span>Hey all,
 I am running into issues with WSUS on a new environment. I can&#x27;t go into details, but it is an environment without internet connection.
 There is a WSUS server (Server 2022) with imported updates from an upstream server. The updates including metadata are imported successfully.
 The clients are also reporting to the WSUS server and the status of the clients in WSUS is 99%.
 The updates that are pulled from the WSUS server on the clients are stuck at downloading 0%.
 I&#x27;ve confirmed that I can reach the WSUS server IIS on port 8530 but the updates are stuck on all my clients.
 Disabling Windows Update service and deleting the files in SoftwareDistribution folder was not the trick. Windows defender firewall service is running.
 Would appreciate any tips about this one!

                              <span>So we are going to be rolling out windows 11 across all laptops soon but one really annoying issue keeps appearing .
 When joined to the domain and ran windows updates, after the first 2/3 reboots of the device we seem to loose the ability to log into windows 11. There is no username or password options on the page, just the blurry acrylic look.
 I&#x27;m struggling to find out the root cause of this issue or a permanent solution to prevent this happening. These are brand new out the box hp laptops. 
 I am going to reimage one with a windows bootable usb (created within windows and no other 3rd party apps) but this is becoming increasingly common and frustrating.

                              <span>First post...
 We are re-cabling the data center from copper to fiber. We need about 200 patch om4 LC patch cables to connect switch and servers. Some are &quot;standard&quot; lenghts, some must be ordered (2 months delivery time).
 We have a company that helps us to install patch panels/cassettes and has the tool to join the fibers. We&#x27;d like to ask them to buy/expand their equipment to create patch cords, so that we may have them in a short time and with correct lenght (as they already do for copper).
 Does anybody make its own patch cords this way? Possible problems to be aware?
 Thanks

 My boss has a website on WordPress. He wants to install a free uptime monitor to fit their needs (1 min checks, email notifs for down time). I found that PHPServerMonitor is one of the simplest according to reddit?
 I have zero knowledge on this. How do I install it? I tried reading the documentation but I do not understand even the first step. 
 It says to upload the files to my webserver? Does that mean wordpress?
 Kindly help me out.

                              <span>Hyia, we&#x27;re currently moving to a new school site and this will be the occasion to rearrange configuration and settings.
 We currently have these VLANs:
  
Core: Servers and on premise trusted workstations
 Staff: BYOD and mobile phones
 Guest: Students and guests
 Printers: to allow selected VLANs to print
 PBX: as it says
  
Now, apart from adding a videosurveillance system, which will use its own VLAN, we&#x27;re wondering if it makes sense to separate servers (Active Directory) from on premise trusted workstations. 
 What we would achieve: 
  
Security: By segregating servers and workstations, you create a logical separation between them. This helps in implementing stricter security policies and access controls. Even if the server firewall is compromised, an attacker would still need to bypass additional security measures to gain access to the workstations&#x27; network.
 Reduced Attack Surface: Placing servers and workstations on separate VLANs limits the exposure of critical server resources to potential threats originating from workstations. It minimizes the attack surface, reducing the chances of unauthorized access, data breaches, or lateral movement within the network.
 Performance Optimization: Servers often require more bandwidth and have different traffic patterns compared to workstations. By segregating them on separate VLANs, you can prioritize and optimize network resources for server traffic, ensuring efficient communication and reducing the risk of congestion caused by workstation-related traffic.
  
Now thinking of the extra complexity layer added by the above setup. Implementing Inter-VLAN Routing, to allow for controlled communication between VLANs. By selectively permitting specific traffic between VLANs, you can ensure that essential services, such as DNS, DHCP, domain authentication, print queues, and file shares, remain accessible to workstations but this might be a long trial and error process
 Your thoughts?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m seeking advice on choosing an UPS to protect and power a NAS, a router, and a PC during blackouts, allowing me to safely shut them down.
 I&#x27;ve familiarized myself with different types of UPS (online, offline, line interactive) and waveform characteristics.
 I have the opportunity to purchase an APC Back-UPS Pro 1500 or an APC Smart-UPS. The main difference I&#x27;ve noticed between the two is that the Smart-UPS offers a pure sine wave.
 In addition, both UPS models are available at a highly competitive price of 150€.
 What other factors should I consider in my decision? And which of the two models would you recommend?
 Thank you for your assistance.

                              <span>Hi here&#x27;s the problem - when you get a certificate drop-down selection prompt in Edge or Chrome, how do I prevent it from showing certificates belonging to previous users?
 https://textplain.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/image-7.png?w&#x3D;1024
 Background - I&#x27;m in charge of a unusual project to create a kiosk mode Windows 10 account for a multi-user government computer. Most of the users rely on their government issued &quot;PIV&quot; cards for authentication to log into various websites. Even though this is a multi-user computer, the users are handling sensitive HR forms and privacy is important. I&#x27;ve configured the kiosk mode as such. But the certificate prompt they see where they see former users&#x27; cards and names is a disaster and a privacy violation.
 Right now I have a script running in the task scheduler that clears the certificate cache every 24 hours. But it&#x27;s not a solution, just a workaround. Any ideas?

                              <span>Hey,
 I have 2 different GPOs in this example, one is directly under the Domain - Global GPO - and one is burried down in an User OU - Custom GPO.
 In my Global GPO I have set the Setting &quot;Local Area Network (LAN) settings&quot; to yes. This Setting is located unter User Configuration - Preferences - Control Panel Settings - Internet Settings - Internet Explorer 10: Internet Explorer 10 - Connections.
 This Setting works just fine.
 Now in my Custom GPO I have set the Setting &quot;Local Area Network (LAN) settings&quot; to no, and it does not override my Global GPO. I even tried to set it to forced and it didn&#x27;t change anything.
 When I enter gpresult on an User affected by Custom GPO, it shows that the GPO is applied however, it shows Global GPO as the winning GPO.
 Am I missing something?
 edit: Global GPO is not set as enforced

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m new to whole sysadmin stuff. So the issue is nearly 10 servers of my institution went &quot;dead&quot; and not booting up at all. I have checked the GPUs and atleast one of them work, so its safe to assume that I can salvage the GPUs, but the technician said there is an issue with the Motherboard and that&#x27;s why it isn&#x27;t booting up anymore, no BIOS flash screen.
 I&#x27;m genuinely interested in re-using the hardware, there are atleast 40 GTX 1080Tis in there (each server has 4 GPUs in it.)
 The server racks were bought in 2016 when 1080Tis were a big deal. All of them are SuperMicro or Fujitsu systems.
 Any ideas what to do in order to reuse the compute power? The technician said the power supply is not manufactured of this model anymore, and the motherboards are hard to get, basically he is quoting for new purchase order altogether.
 Any ideas on how to proceed further?

                              <span>Hi,
 I was wondering how everyone else in here are managing their certs. Currently we have a wildcard cert and a few other certs as well as some self-signed certs internally.
  
 But lately we have considered getting a seperate certificate for each of our public facing services instead of using the same wildcard cert for services.
  
 I&#x27;m curious if this will be a pain to manage or if there is a nice tool for this. We are using Azure quite heavily and i see they have an SSL store, but i would idealy like something that could potentially autorenew the certificates.
  
 It seems like Keymanager Plus from ManageEngine can do something like that.
  
 How is everyone else managing it? Any software recommendations?

                              <span>Come tomorrow morning all managers will be made aware that staff must submit tickets to the help desk if they want IT help. No more banging on my door or &quot;paging&quot; me. I used to put in the tickets for the staff to record my time, but I&#x27;m not doing it anymore, because of the abuse. Friday I got pulled in all different directions all because a staff member didn&#x27;t realize a power adapter and outlet was not working and they had to keep their laptop charged. They literally didn&#x27;t understand the concept of charging a laptop. :D It was two hours of fighting with managers about getting up and &quot;fixing the problem,&quot; while I was in an unrelated meeting with my bosses.
 My two main questions are should I deactivate my personal extension? I don&#x27;t see the need for it really. I&#x27;m not really ever going to be answering it again. My team has my cell phone number and our slack channel. It will get in the way of the enforcement and the users will have the help desk main line that they can call. The only people who may need to call me is an outside vendor but I do have another number they can use.
 Also another question is, how does a user submit a ticket if they have no internet at their workstation? I am assuming that they tell their supervisor and they put in the ticket? How does it work for you guys?

 What does this mean? Does it mean that:
  
the TCP connection between my laptop and Server Y is being copied by App X; or 
 App X has copied the TCP connection between my laptop and other servers, and is now sending it to Server Y?

                              <span>Hello! I&#x27;m building racks for an install in which the general contractor has used Cat7 (cough) S/FTP throughout. I&#x27;d like to use Cat6a patch in the racks, however I can only seem to find the nice neat lengths I want in F/FTP. Is there an issue running S/FTP into a (shielded 6a) keystone patch panel and F/FTP out of it?
 My thinking is that the grounding issues introduced by using UTP patch wouldn&#x27;t be present, and I&#x27;d just be sacrificing some negligible level of interference protection within the racks, but I&#x27;d like the sense check from someone more knowledgeable.
 Somebody is going to tell me to make my own in the lengths I want... But it&#x27;s hundreds of patch cables and I don&#x27;t have the time to do it myself!

                              <span>I&#x27;m working with a client on a setting up IPSec VPN with BGP and wasn&#x27;t sure if the existing routing BGP/EIGRP redistribution design would have any issues. Here are the details of the setup and topology
 https://imgur.com/a/WHVlUf0
 ​
  
Physical connectivity: HQ Campus, datacenter Silicon Valley, and datacenter Seattle are connected via dark fiber on Nexus 9K switches.
 EIGRP: The Nexus 9K switches in each location (SE-SW, SV-SW, HQ-SW) are running EIGRP to exchange routes internally.
 BGP: BGP is configured on the Nexus 9K switches for external routing. In Seattle, the Nexus switch (SE-SW) has a BGP peering with a Fortigate Firewall (SE-FGT) on AS 65010. In Silicon Valley, the Nexus switch (SV-SW) has a BGP peering with a Fortigate Firewall (SV-FGT) on AS 65011.
 Redistribution: The firewalls (SE-FGT and SV-FGT) are learning the 172.22.1.0/24 network from their respective Nexus switches (SE-SW and SV-SW) through EIGRP redistribution.
 Partner1: Both Fortigate Firewalls (SE-FGT and SV-FGT) have a BGP peering with Partner1, which advertises the 10.0.0.0/24 network.
  
Now, here are my questions:
  
Do I need to configure iBGP between SE-SW and SV-SW? Both Nexus switches are already exchanging routes via EIGRP redistribution, so is iBGP necessary in this case?
 Is it necessary to configure BGP peering between SE-FGT and SV-FGT? Since both firewalls are connected to their respective Nexus switches and are already learning routes from Partner1 through BGP, is direct BGP peering between the firewalls necessary?

                              <span>I have two ISP connections available. With one of the ISPs, I use public IPs and apply Destination NATTING for the internal sites accessible on the internet. However, if this particular ISP link fails, the public IPs and consequently the sites will also go down. Is there a solution to keep the sites operational even if one of the ISP connections fails, assuming I have two ISP connections?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve extremely little experience with multicast, any assistance is gratefully received!
 We have 9200 access switches that are hitting tcam limits on multicast, this is causing issues for unicast traffic as well somehow.
 Config wise we just have ip pim smarse dense mode enabled on uplinks and ip multicast enabled so super simple..
 We only really need mcast on voice subnets, is there anyway of stopping other subnets/blame from participating and reducing the load on the TCAM table
 Many thanks

                              <span>I have very good understanding of networking with some good solid hands-on experience. But most of what I do I learned by the book.
 I have always been curious how actually networks interface with the physical boxes. For a company to make a switch, how do they add things like TCP/IP suite. How do they do they mac address learnings? How do they keep encrypted packet encrypted etc?
 I want to understand network from a very low level. Anyone ever had this sort of curiosity?

                              <span>Hi,
 I got hundreds of clients with their own, separate vlans. All currently going from datacenter A to datacenter B by path:
 ZTE ZXR10 5960 (A)  (B) Cisco Nexus 3064. Of course on both devices we got jumbo enabled.
 Currently we added Cisco Nexus 93180 to our set. It looks like this:
 ZTE ZXR  Nexus 93180  Nexus93180  Nexus3064.
 After we switch to new 100g FO link some of the vlans in where clients put their vlans (qinq) stop working. Nexus 93180 all totally in switchport mode, no routing interfaces, on every interface I added: # mtu 9216, and so it shows on both devices in both datacenters to every direction. I am almost sure that this is somehow to inproper jumbo handling. Communities say - set „system mtu jumbo” but I have no such command, and after reading through manual - I can set up on interfaces manually (like I did).
 May I have any thoughts on this? Thanks in advance.

 Our 9606 continuously is giving us this error in the logs.....
 &quot;%PLATFORM-3-ELEMENT_CRITICAL:Switch 1 R0/0: smand: 1/RP/0: Used Memory value 98% exceeds critical level 95%&quot; 
 From what I read online, atleast with other cisco switches, this is a software bug in other IOSXE versions. We are currently running 17.9.2 on this switch, and 17.9.3 is the newest software.
 Is this most likely another software bug, or is there something else I should check to fix this issue?
 I ran &quot;show processes memory&quot; and got this output....

 Just curious if there is a quick fix for this error that will solve the issue immediately? Or is it definetly a software bug? I cannot do an update right away as I need to schedule an out*** with upper management, and that will take some time.

 I know you can do a ping -f -l 1500 to test for MTU, but I&#x27;d like to check if a particular protocol (SSH in this case) is having issues due to MSS issues.
 Long version: I&#x27;m having issues with Ruckus AP  Controller communication where the controller is at the other end of a VPN link, so I want to see if the APController SSH tunnel is experiencing issues with MSS and is causing packets to drop. I can get full shell access to the AP if needed, but I&#x27;m not sure what commands I would need to run - what would you do?

                              <span>I was reading some things and came across a problem. It mentions that there is Packet duplication or loss during failover of redundant egress links/traffic. Issue is related to time synchronisation and due to the queuing delays? Can anyone tell me what does these companies do to tackle this situation?

 I&#x27;m in the process of renewing my core networking. 
 Actually I&#x27;m evaluating 2x Juniper EX4400 or DELL S4148T .
 I can find a lot of information on the Juniper but I cannot find on reddit opinions on the DELL powerswitch 4100 series. 
 Does anyone have experience with these switches? What are your opinions about them?

                              <span>I found this recently to be causing lag failures in a number of locations and I can&#x27;t imagine why one would want to force 2 links if the lag contains 2 interfaces to begin with? It&#x27;s just a fatter SPOF at this point no? Isn&#x27;t the whole point of a lag redundancy + bandwidth? You&#x27;re chopping off the other purpose entirely and it&#x27;s preventing the lags from coming up anyway.
 These Junipers connect over to Cisco PE routers - is there some obscure compatibility issue I don&#x27;t know about?
 In writing this it seems settings them to a lower count and then back at least let&#x27;s them come up, still totally confused though.

                              <span>Newbie here. So i&#x27;ve got an opportunity to work &amp; impliment a network design for a small plant. Their existing design is that they are terminating all their ISPs in the Fortigate &amp; from there they are getting a LAN network (10.3.70.0/23 - Gateway:- 10.3.70.1) to an unmanaged switch. They have few servers on that switch &amp; from that switch they are giving uplink to other unmanaged access switches. My work here is to configure a Core switch(9300L) which will have VLANs for Data &amp; Voice &amp; will handle all the inter-vlan routing &amp; DHCP request as well as default route to the Gateway (FW). Easy, but the catch is that i can not touch the Fortigate firewall or change anything there. 
  
If i divide the /23 network into two /24 network, will there be any issue in the FW?
 
Is there any way that can i put the servers on Data vlan(10.3.70.0/24) without changing their subnet mask?
 
Can i terminate the LAN from the FW to Core in the Data vlan as an access port or is there a better way.
 
 If you have any good suggestions than feel free to let me know. 
 *Sorry for the lengthy post. Thank you.

The firmware file I received worked fine on the first three, but the last two are saying that the calculated md5 hash doesn&#x27;t match the embedded md5 hash, and so they won&#x27;t use it. I&#x27;ve tried with both 17.6.5 and 17.9.3. (I tried the 17.9.3 first, because it was what I was given, and after that didn&#x27;t work, I thought to ask for the 17.6.5 as an intermediate step.) I&#x27;ve tried multiple downloads of each, but keep getting the same error.
 Now, not being a habitual Cisco person, I&#x27;ve been using the web gui to do these updates. I am well aware more netadmins prefer to use the cli, but I am just not good at the Cisco cli, so I avoid it. If there is something in the cli that I can use rather than the web gui, I&#x27;m willing to try it. I just don&#x27;t know enough about the cli to know what to try right now. 
 As for going to my corporate net admins, they are overloaded, and don&#x27;t respond to tickets for months, so I can&#x27;t really do much there. I&#x27;d rather not uselessly add to their workload, with them in that situation. So, any help for me would be helping them.

                              <span>Purpose, trying to backup about 14TB of data from a server to 2 NAS&#x27;s. Server seems to max out @ 1Gbps.
 Recently, I added a 10Gbit SFP+ NIC into our Dell T430 server. Purchased 2 SFP+ MM Fiber 10Gbit fiber modules along with a 10Gbit MM fiber cable. Running a Unifi US-48-500W switch (Flow control/Jumbo Frames enabled). SFP+ Modules &amp; MM fiber cable go directly from server SPF+ Port to SFP+ Port on switch.
 Windows shows full 10Gbit connection (Verified in Device Management that &quot;Speed and Duplex&quot; are set to &quot;10Gbps Full Duplex&quot;) and Unifi Shows a 10Gbit connection in the console.
 We have 2 main NAS&#x27;s configured in 802.3ad LACP (One Synology DS416 and one WD EX4100 both with RAID 5 4x 8TB drives) Both show 2000Mbps connections.
 T430 has 8x 8TB Drives and when copying a file (Not through network) from RAID to SSD boot drive, achieves ~360MBytes. So I know the RAID is at least capable of those speeds.
 Copying files from RAID to either single NAS averages around 110MBytes. I understand that LAG does not increase transfer speeds for single client as it will just use one connection technically.
 However, when trying to transfer data from the server to both NAS&#x27;s, the Server NIC pegs out at 1GBit. Both NAS&#x27;s should be able to take at least 1Gbit each and the server should be putting out 2GBits total.
 Also tried copying one file from Server to NAS and copying another file from Server to Desktop PC at the same time. Originally transfers around 100MBps and as soon as the 2nd file transfer starts, the server file transfer speeds are split between the two to about 50MBps each.
 Thoughts/Idea&#x27;s anyone?

                              <span>Looking at perimeter firewalls for a small enterprise environment (600ish users). I know the Palo is gonna win on support, their UI looks a little cleaner, Wildfire seems like a great feature. Cost wise the Fortinet is miles cheaper and the throughput / total feature set is similar between the two. Looking at SD-WAN, a few IPsec tunnels, and will be peering to Azure and AWS.
 What would you recommend and why?

                              <span>yo,
 I&#x27;ve been looking into labels, specifically the bluetooth one, such as - niimbot, phomemo, brother cube,etc. And have just realised that most of them are shown to be printing black on white, and never the other way around. Are these thermal bluetooth label makers able to do it - print white on black, or does the printer have to have some special technology?
 Whichever it may be, please give me recommendations for good label printer/makers (that are able to print white on black ofc xd).

                              <span>Hi. I have been replacing some of our switches with Catalyst 9300 series. Overall, they are great. Today, I had 2 switches to configure. One of them doesn&#x27;t seem to support eem script. I fact, the &quot;event&quot; command doesn&#x27;t even exist in config terminal mode. The other works just fine. Both are running IOS-XE v17. Is there a special command to enable such feature? I know in NX-OS you have to explicitly enable some features via &quot;feature&quot; commands. Is it license dependent?! Google hasn&#x27;t been able to help me...

                              <span>I have 4 buildings each has there own subnet based off their school id.
 HS 10.2.x.x MS 10.3.x.x Elem 1 10.3.x.x Elem 2 10.4.x.x
 The previous director shared the vlans across each building. And on each core switch at the buildings is a vlan 128 interface with an IP helper. All core switches in each building are connected via a trunk port with all vlans passing. 
 Example vlan below:
 VLAN 128 - Employee WiFi Clients
 Interface vlan 128 on each core with a submet mask of 255.255.224.0 
 HS 10.1.128.1 MS 10.2.128.1 Elem 1 10.3.128.1 Elem 2 10.4.128.1
 I&#x27;m not sure if this is best practice but reading up on things seems it isn&#x27;t. I dunno, it works for us.
 Should I be doing things differently?

                              <span>Hi people,
 For a project I want to extend routing from the host into the VM. VMs run in KVM. So basically VM-&gt;Vm-Host-&gt;Leaf-&gt;Spine, and so on. 
 My first idea was to create a bridge, add the VMs interface and a dummy interface on the host to it and have a routing daemon run on both “sides”. On the host have routing between the dummy interface and physical interface setup. Repeat for each VM that runs on the host. But this doesnt sound like a very good design and is cumbersome, bc extra bridge for each VM. 
 Would that even work? What would be a better idea? 
 Cheers and thanks!

 Hi everyone! Has anyone tried using OMADA and tp link products for SCHOOL WIFI ZONE CAMPUS WIDE use? About 5000 concurrent users.
 Here&#x27;s the Plan: There will be 5 buildings and Im planning to use PTP to bridge the connection from Server room at the main building to the other 4 buildings. (Its a big campus and they do not allow cables to cross on each buildings). Then setup a wired AP (EAP610) per floor. Other APs will be configured as MESH per floor with the wired AP as their main AP. 
 Can you give me advice, feedback or recommendations with this setup? Thank you.

                              <span>What do you guys use to monitor routers, specifically Mikrotik activities? In my workplace they use PRTG which in my opinion is a bit ineffective. Like sure we can see the cpu usage and how much traffics are going in and out. But that&#x27;s it. There&#x27;s no logging whatsoever. I&#x27;m no expert in that field but ideally shouldn&#x27;t we have some logs about all the configurations in the router? Like when a user added an IP Address, a change in interface configuration, etc etc. Also details each traffics from each IP and VLAN should be logged to a certain extent no? The thing is, let&#x27;s say that there&#x27;s a 1 second spike in the traffic, but no one was paying attention at the time and only realized it few minutes later. Then we wouldn&#x27;t know what happened and from which IP or VLAN that spike came from. In Mikrotik there&#x27;s the &quot;Torch&quot; function to monitor real time traffic only for selected interface. But no logging at all which i think is really necessary.

 I have a small question, I would like to know if I will be able to change the Serial on a Huawei GPON SFP Module by accessing the GUI or through TELNET?
 These are the 2 GPON Modules.

 Also considering just setting up the policies via local group policy since the user will not have admin.

 I am put on a new project/product that has been acquired and the people who worked on it has just left with no documentation. I am now asked to figure out the bare bones of the infrastructure so it can be moved over to the main company. They are thinking of potentially recreating it, which is weird but they want the option in case. 
 They want me to get an inventory of what is in there and how much it costs.
 The infrastructure as I see it is in Azure.

                              <span>The below email was received from an outside organization. We are wanting to set this up for our company. Specifically in relation to guest accounts that are automatically created when documents from sharepoint are shared externally with guest users. However I am not clear on how this was setup within 365 and I can&#x27;t find documentation related to this specifically.
 I did locate Sharepoint setting: &quot;Guest access to a site or OneDrive will expire automatically after this many days&quot; - However based on what I read in the documentation, this is not the setting that has generated the below email notification.
 ​
 Are any of you aware on how to set this up? 
  
This is an automated email from &quot;Organization&quot; - your &quot;Organization&quot; guest account is about to expire.
  
This email address is registered as having &#x27;guest&#x27; access to some shared information or services with &quot;Organization&quot; systems. As this guest account access has not been used recently (almost 90 days) your account access is about to expire and be deleted.
 &quot;Organization&quot; Guest accounts must be used every 90 days to retain their active status. To renew your access - simply log into the &quot;Organization&quot; system to which this account was invited; or contact your &quot;Organization&quot; contact person.

 When playing around with the Hyper-V, I noticed that some Group Policies were accessed from the local computer. To be clear, we&#x27;re talking about GPMC, not GPEdit (or Local Policies). What I did on my Hyper-V, not on the DC but the PC which accesses GP on it, I installed some templates on it.
 Do the templates NEED to be installed on the DC or only the PC used to access the Group Policy Management Console? Would these policies, when abled, have any effect on the client PCs where the GP applies?

                              <span>It&#x27;s been impossible to buy a house in Vancouver (Canada) on a single income for a long time now, but now our condos have fallen into the same category.
 Can any sysadmins working in Texas speak to the quality of life down there? I&#x27;m thinking of relocating.
 The average rent for a 1 br apartment in Vancouver increased to $2,850 this year, and it just feels like we&#x27;re working hard for nothing, with no prospect of home ownership at the end of it.
 If I ever want to buy a 2 br home in Vancouver, this is what the market&#x27;s like. (And remember: all this in a city where the average income is $61,000. A lot of IT jobs here don&#x27;t pay significantly more than that.)

                              <span>I want to get into the world of a sys admin but i know starting at a help desk is the proper first step.
 What home labs can I do at home in order to help me reach my goal as a help desk and then level up over time to a sysadmin
 I know windows server is a great thing to learn but I want to know how to break it so that I can fix it
 I know that Azure is also a good thing to learn
 I found an opensource program that I can use for my own help desk and I can make a bash script that generates me random tickets for me to practice helping
 Any other tips or tricks. I am also still going for my A+

                              <span>Hi all, there were two domain controllers, DC1 and DC2. They are VMs. I found out that the previous system admin shut it down and remove DC2 without demoting it first. Then he built DC3 and left the company. DC2 is still in ADUC and not in DNS I am not able to remove it in ADUC. How do I completely remove DC2 in ADUC ??? Thank you.

                              <span>I have been using Windows10 and 11 Pro build USB sticks with Autounattend.xml file for a few years. Love it, works great. Nice and easy to get through the install with as little clicks as possible.
 However, new model of laptop came through, and it fails due to it not having drivers for the Intel Rapid Storage Driver. 
 So I had to rename the autounattend file (essentially deleting it), so I receive the prompt to install the drivers, insert additional usb with them on, and then get to installing - with all the damn clicks...
 Of course, now its not using the xml file at all...
 Is there a painless way to do this without rebuilding the world?

Update - As unlikely as it seems, I think I suffered from multi SSD failure at the same time. Somehow it was hidden until the reboot, maybe windows was caching stuff in ram? Everything that died was on 3 different ssds. All the vms that still work are on different drives. 
 what are the chances of that?
 I&#x27;ve purchased new enterprise grade ssds, and have fixed the backup system. Now its time to recover the bits of the VMS that died and rebuild.
  
Update2 - I found some cool software and was able to recover everything except about 1.4G of data. That I have approx. 4 VHD files that wont boot, but with some work I can probably fix that. The rest are kind of working, but probably need some looking at. I&#x27;m not sure how 3 SSDs fail…</span>

I still that removed site in DNS under _msdcs. (along with the two other remaining sites). The decom&#x27;d site shows up under &#x27;dc&#x27; and &#x27;gc&#x27; (under _sites). Looking at the _tcp folder for the removed site, I see an _ldap record that points to our FSMO DC that lives in our primary site. Is this typical behavior for removing a site? Did I miss a step? Do I just simply delete that _ldap record, and then delete the _sites folders under &#x27;dc&#x27; and &#x27;gc&#x27;? Or do I need to go back to &quot;AD Sites and Services&quot; and do something there to get it to update DNS correctly?

                              <span>Hi all,
 Just after a bit of insight into how the company you work for offers training to its IT staff?
 I work for a large company in a 3rd Line role and have been with them for around 5 years. In that time I cannot remember any meaningful training that&#x27;s been offered to me either individually or as a team and its incredibly frustrating. We get the standard corporate crap like heavy lifting, gdpr, modern slavery, etc etc but no training for our roles.
 As an example, we&#x27;ve recently moved over to azure and although I have quite a lot of access within it, I have received zero training on it from the business. The access for the team gets less as you go down the levels e.g. 1st line and 2nd line have restricted access and can only do certain things like add someone to a group.
 We have a knowledge base but I wouldn&#x27;t say it&#x27;s the best - we do try to keep it up to date though as much as possible. 
 What does your company offer you? If anything? Or do you just learn in your own time? 
 I&#x27;m interested to find out if anybody has time set aside for them to train e.g. Comptia courses, azure fundamentals - stuff like that. 
 I find I have to use my own time to train which I don&#x27;t think I should be doing.

                              <span>Context: I&#x27;m a junior in the sysadmin/cloud engineer space. Been working with Linux, mostly system maintainance,monitoring, performance tuning, docker for the past 2 years.
 I am thinking of delving into linux FreeBSD* and focusing on Linux and FreeBSD for my core skillsets. I&#x27;ve heard that freebsd is more secure, like for example jails are a better isolation implementation than docker
 How true are these claims today in 2023, and Is it a good idea to get into FreeBSD putting the effort.
 If so what are some things to keep in mind.

                              <span>I have been dissecting pretty much every step of THIS MS Learn guide to build a custom and automated Windows 10 image to deploy on company laptops (they are HAADJ and manage with Intune)
 The one thing that I can&#x27;t get to work is adding Windows Updates to my image. I have tried:
  
apply updates offline (.msu from Windows Catalog) with DISM /Add-Packages
 offline install of same .msu updates in Audit Mode + sysprep + DISM image capture 
 run online Windows Update in Audit Mode + sysprep + DISM image capture 
  
In all these cases, after deploying the image on a real laptop, Cumulative Updates are not present in the list of installed updates and as soon as PC has Internet, Windows Update begins the download &amp; install process of both 06-2023 and 04-2023 Cumulative Updates. This slows the whole setup down and is driving me crazy. 
 Appreciate any idea on what I might be doing wrong here, thanks.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve always been either solo-IT, or in a very small IT team, where I did a little bit of everything. 
 Does anyone have any experiences going from a small IT team at a small/mid-size company to a huge company with like hundreds of IT staff, and in-house development, etc? How hard of an adjustment was it for you? What did you like most about going to a huge company? What did you dislike the most moving to a huge company? What about the interview process at a huge company vs a small company? 
 or maybe share an experience going in the opposite direction from a huge company to a very small company?

                              <span>Hi,
 I had this idea to secure more my server and wanted your advice:
 Imagine for example if:
 1- I configure Restricted ssh access to my server by IP Address
 /etc/hosts.allow 
 sshd,sshdfwd-X11: 192.168.2.111 192.168.2.101 
 /etc/hosts.deny 
 sshd,sshdfwd-X11:ALL
 2- I configure restricted wp-admin access in nginx conf
  
 location ~ ^/(wp-admin|wp-login\.php) {
 allow 1.2.3.4;
 deny all;
 } 
 If now there is a wordpress vunerability that allow the attacker to upload a shell backdoor to my website. will he still be able to modify files in website directories, gain access, ect... ? How usefull are restrictions like this ?

As a non-expert in this field, I&#x27;m not entirely sure if this is something I should be concerned about. Could anyone provide some insights?

 I bought a wireless display adapter but needed type-c for power. The problem is my monitor doesn&#x27;t have any usb port. May I ask if it is possible to buy a display port to type-c adapter to connect the monitor and wireless display adapter for power?
 Thank you very much!

The issue is I have another drive which would’ve had the same password set at the beginning, but I don’t have a recovery key for it. Is there any way to view the password of the drive I have the recovery key for so that I can us it to access the other drive?

                              <span>Applied to a tier 2/sysadmin position at a small, local company on Tuesday. The staffing agency called me on Thursday, said the company was moving fast and scheduled me for yesterday morning. The initial interviewer liked my experience so much (despite fumbling some technical questions) that he asked the agency to schedule me for a second round interview in the afternoon with the president and CEO. They liked my experience and said how they wanted to hire quickly and asked me when I could start. It even turned slightly casual when they asked me about my hobbies.
 Is this a good sign? They&#x27;ll tell the agency after the 4th of July weekend.,

 I have followed this blog for a while, I love the fact we have a successful business resource saying what the technical teams already knew, the cloud isn&#x27;t cheap!
 From my point of view I am at the other end of the process with management coming along every 6 months or so saying why don&#x27;t we &quot;use the cloud&quot; - the general first response is why should we.
 When I run the numbers again and show it increasing our infrastructure costs by 250% they go away again for a few months. The one quantifiable I don&#x27;t include in figures is staffing to run the physical hardware, mainly because from experience outside of replacing hardware, our team going to server room is probably a once a month event. Running a VM in VMware doesn&#x27;t need more manpower than running on Aws. The fact the move back to on prem required no extra staff is a confirmation of this.

                              <span>Hi
 I was wondering if someone could help me with this. I am seeing a lot of alerts for the event ID 4625 - Account Failed To Log On. 
 Below is a example:
 An account failed to log on.
 Subject:
 Security ID: S-1-0-0 Account Name: - Account Domain: - Logon ID: 0x0 
 Logon Type: 3
 Account For Which Logon Failed:
 Security ID: S-1-0-0 Account Name: TomJones Account Domain: mydomain 
 Failure Information:
 Failure Reason: An Error occured during Logon. Status: 0xC00002EE Sub Status: 0x0 
 Process Information:
 Caller Process ID: 0x0 Caller Process Name: - 
 Network Information:
 Workstation Name: - Source Network Address: - Source Port: - 
 Detailed Authentication Information:
 Logon Process: Kerberos Authentication Package: Kerberos Transited Services: - Package Name (NTLM only): - Key Length: 0 
 We are seeing a large number of these events within our monitoring systems, which I believe may also be the cause of our current where multiple users are getting locked out randomly. 
 I have cleared cached passwords on the users machine ( credential manager), purged their KLIST, removed invalid passwords from their Edge browser which uses SSO, but still no change.
 I spoke to one user when the alert came through and they stated they had not been near their laptop. These events are network related as the logon type is 3.
 The status code indicates - STATUS_UNFINISHED_CONTEXT_DELETED
 A security context was deleted before the context was completed. This is considered a logon failure. 
 I am not sure what this means exactly.
 Has anyone come across something like this similar?
 Thanks

                              <span>Ladies and gents,
 I&#x27;m at somewhat of a cross road, I&#x27;m making as much as a generalist would make, or so I think. I&#x27;m looking for a career change for a few reasons, 1) moar money, duh. 2) WFH FTW!. 3)More options in the future.
 We&#x27;re all familiar with the dead end tech support, customer support positions so I&#x27;m not gonna go into that rant/vent here. As I&#x27;ve always learn by doing, I hardly have certificate/certifcations under my belt to show for what I can do.
 What I can do: recently got CCNA, CCNP is well within reason. LPIC-1 is probably low hanging fruit too, might strive for LPIC-2. Most recent dabbling with python &amp; powershell. Not a front end guy, but back end, bring it on.
 So, I&#x27;m going to hunker down and get certs to try and get myself another position. The way I see it, I can either go into product customer support, which would somewhat limit myself to my employer&#x27;s products, but that can be lucrative. Or go into DevOps/SRE/Data Analyst.
 Any advice on which to focus on, or something else I&#x27;m not aware of, and the path to it, that&#x27;ll be great. WFH is definitely a must for me, as I planned to WFH and move some place with lower cost of living before my current job which doesn&#x27;t allow WFH. If I can manage to double employ down the road, even better.
 So lay it on me, guys.

                              <span>We have over 20 TB of shared Drive storage, so I&#x27;m not worried about us running out any time soon, but he&#x27;s clearly just using it for the sake of it and it&#x27;s stupid.
 I heard from another student this guy was bored, so he uploaded a Windows ISO file (~4 GB) multiple times. We&#x27;re no way near our shared storage limit but it&#x27;s just annoying af.
 How would you handle this? Could go the formal reprimand route and tell him to stop wasting storage space but just wondering what would happen if I applied a storage quota once someone&#x27;s already over the limit?
 I had a look in the log files but it only seems to show the names and times uploads occur, rather than sizes of files.

                              <span>I&#x27;m about to colo my first server. It&#x27;s a Supermicro Superstorage 6028R-e1CR16T. Looking at the specs for the server, I have a concern about width.
 Width 17.2&quot; (437mm)
 Height
 3.5&quot; (89mm)
 Depth
 25.5&quot; (647mm)
 My colo facility says their racks are 48 U tall starting at 1 and have the industry standard 19” mounting width. Unless there is something I don&#x27;t understand, my servers 17.2 will not fit in side 19&quot; with rails right?

                              <span>I have recently been put in charge of an expanding project for my manufacturing company. We are adding a bunch of operation technology to the manufacturing floor and the problem I am running into is that the machines on the floor are using a standard IP scheme that is apparently not able to change at mass scale and the problem is, each manufacturing line uses around 40-50 &quot;IPs&quot; locally which I am not sure what they are but for example sake lets say they are 192.168.1.0/24 network. Now the IT Network is 10.5.1.0/25 per manufacturing area. Only one or two of the devices within the 40-50 devices in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet need to be able to export its data to the 10.5.1.0/25 subnet that contains a server collecting the data. How we have been currently doing that is one to one NAT&#x27;s with port level NAT&#x27;s using industrial DINN network switches. The problem I am trying to solve with this, is that this requires a switch per device since these switches we are using only have 2 or 4 ports on. One port for the 192.168.1.0 IP and one for the IT Routable subnet. What I am wanting is either a fix to this without re-IPing the machines but a more central device that can handle the NAT&#x27;s. I am thinking a 48 port switch that I can basically NAT the machine IP&#x27;s in mass? Anyone got Ideas? If I am completely missing an easy solution please no hate.
 ​
 EDIT:: So the IE-2000, Could I implement that back at the Network cabinet and terminate all of the devices needing connected to it then have one uplink port to the OT Network and configure L2NAT instances for each interface?

                              <span>Earlier post asking about V6 adoption. Dinosaur here, recollecting that the big issue for adoption late-90s early 2000s was that the design/policy was that enterprise V6 allocations were only from an ISP, there would be no Provider-Independent allocations. (I think this was because v4 routing tables were outpacing router memory at the time. Having ISP allocation allowed greater summarization) Naturally there was a storm every time this policy was brought up on NANOG. If one wanted to have more than one upstream for resiliency, there would be two entirely separate V6 address spaces. So a complex protocol came out of the Network Working Group: RFC 5533, Shim-6: Multi-homing Shim Protocol. When the policy was inevitably changed to PI allocations I felt so sorry for the folks who must have spent many meetings working out the Shim Protocol. PI address space allocation was the beginning of the long adoption process.

 I&#x27;m working for a company that has oil wells spread across several thousand acres of land. We are looking into the feasibility of a multiyear effort to fit all of the wells with various kinds of sensors and detectors, which will give us maintenance data a lot faster.
 I&#x27;m just posting here to get a general sense of the options that are out there. We will hire a network consultant at some point down the line, but for now I&#x27;m just putting together a presentation for the higher ups about this potential project, and I wanted to be able to add additional details about the technologies we would use and perhaps a very rough budget.

 Couple questions, im new in my first line tech job so i might not be able to answer all your questions.
 When it starts up the switch sounds like its taking off to space for like 15 seconds then chills. thats normal right? 
 im trying to reset the thing. thats it. Putty isnt working. I have the correct settings. the cable im using is a RJ45 to usb . its in the correct port in the back (i think) IoIoI port. and it boots to a black screen. Would be a massive help if someone could send me over advice and ill look at this tomorrow as i have been swearing at this switch for about a hour and looking things up and i NEED SLEEP xD 
 Thank you guys so much in advance.

 Im in my late 20s, I intend to work in/around networking for the rest of my career, so that leaves me with around 30 more years in this industry. From a selfish point of view, I hope we just keep using IPv4.
 But if I’m not wrong, Asia is using more and more IPv6 so that leaves me wondering if I’m 5/10 years, IPv6 will overtake IPv4.

                              <span>Hello we will be upgrading our DC access layer switches running cumulus 3.7 to 4.1 . They are in an mlag configuration with servers dual connected to both switches. The switches have l3 links up to the spines. We want to guarantee the upgrades go as smooth as possible with no traffic loss. 
 Wondering if someone that has done this has any tips they would like to share
 What we are planning to execute is the following 
 Drain l3 traffic ( bgp as path prepend advertisement the spines)
 Shutdown all host facing ports and uplink s
 Stop / disable clagd
 Shutdown peer link 
 Perform upgrade
 Bring up peer link 
 Enable / start clagd 
 Remove as path prepend 
 Bring up ports ( at this point nvidia said ports will only be single connected because they switches will be running different version) 
 Switch roles make primary secondary 
 Then do the same steps.

 When I use ldapsearch via terminal i&#x27;m getting a base64 encoded string from the query for &quot;usercertificate;binary&quot; which I can convert to binary to toss up into my own AD. When I run it through by python though i&#x27;m getting a byte string b&#x27;0\x84\x939\usercert info\x393\&#x27;etc etc.
 with ldap3.Connection(server, auto_bind&#x3D;True) as conn:
 conn.search(&quot;base&quot;, &quot;(uid&#x3D;$username)&quot;, attributes&#x3D;&#x27;*&#x27;)
 Then I can just do a test &#x3D; conn.entries[0] and call test.usercertificate to get the data.
 if I do a type against it I get 
 I&#x27;m trying to either:
 1) Download usercertificate;binary and be able to reupload it into my internal AD
 2) convert what I&#x27;m getting into something you can import up into AD, such as a straight binary value or something else.
 I&#x27;ve only dabbled in python with other projects so getting into the deepend with this. I suppose I could also just do a sys call against ldapsearch to get the value I want but figured there has to be a way to do this in python itself.

                              <span>Hey guys! First time posting here, I hope it’s not a duplicate.
 I’ve been desperately trying to figure out a solution to this issue that was assigned to me by my senior team member, thus leading me here.
 We have two Synology NAS (DS920+), each loaded with 14TBx4 disks. The first one is used as main storage, we got the same one to expand our storage, and I figured it’s easier from a client’s pov to have both NASes joined together as a whole storage.
 What i came up with was mount both nfs shares on a VM, unify them with mergerfs and then re-export from VM. It worked but as my senior team member said it’s a single point of failure, therefore I duplicated the VM then spawned another one as a load balancer (HAProxy), but in the end it did not work as NFS refused to mount the LB IP.
 I want to know if it’s possible to unify them under a shared volume or one NFS export.
 I heard about Ganesha and gluster fs but I did not find anything or anyone using it for a similar use case of mine.
 Does anyone have an idea how to scale out nas synology? I’m somewhat desperate and any help is highly appreciated

                              <span>We had a bad switch that started spewing malformed broadcasts onto the subnet at a satellite office. No big deal. It was older, so we replaced it. I configured it based on the configuration of the switch that went bad. I could have swore it was a /23 network.
 This, of course, was a weekend, and come Monday we had endpoints with “stuck” IP addresses that refused to renew, and weird SIP problems where calls went through without problem, but conversations were suddenly muted. I suspected a NAT problem so I went on the hunt. Two days later I still found nothing and felt defeated.
 So, there are a number of issues that lead to this, many of which “existed before me”, but I’m here now and the bottom line is it was my fault. The big boss figured it out and all I could do was slap myself on the forehead. It was originally a /24 network. We reconfigured the PBX and all downstream appliances to use a /23 space. Within 10 minutes all was well.
 Lesson learned was always verify the IP space you are working in. I could have saved myself a lot of time, frustration and embarrassment.
 BTW: I know this is more netadmin stuff. Like many of us my sysadmin duties really run the gamut. So I thought I’d share the lesson here.

                              <span>I have seen the earlier posts regarding DCU but they stop short of some detailed info that would be helpful. 
 What I am thinking is:
  
Use TDM (Tech Direct Dell) to create driver packages, BIOS, tools, etc. That allows me to download a Zip file
 Put the unzipped BIOS files (for example) on the source directory of the SCCM MP. 
 Replicate these folders/files to the DP&#x27;s (using Package\Program)
 Run a command which copies these folders to the local machine (say, C:\Source)
 run the DCU-CLI with appropriate switches to install the updates from the Source folder
 Setup the ADMX Template to turn off Dell.com as a source
  
​
 When thinking a bit further, these drivers, etc are many Gigs of data and will fill things up if I do this repetitively without deleting them periodically.
 This model may not make the best sense, and alternatively I could have the computers run the DCU-CLI and point it to the DP&#x27;s to get the updates. 
 Ideas? Suggestions?
 I&#x27;ve been playing with the switches to try this using just a \\server\share and have not been able to use the UNC path appropriately (not certain which switch specifies the \\server\share), but more problematic is how to have computers in a remote site point to the local DP to scan and apply. 
 Has anyone done it this way? thanks!

 I think we are hitting the 10 year mark soon of our R630s, we hae 4 hour onsite support that expired two years ago but have never needed a call out, one server has a single 16gb ram stick fail but thats it.
 is there any benefit to replacing soon or should i replace when one fails?
 Dell R630
 2x Intel Xeon E5-2630 V3 8 cores
 256GB Ram

 Would like to know your guys infrastructure and plans on when you replace!

 My question is, on the office sign in page, they can still select &quot;enter password instead&quot;. Can that be removed? They don&#x27;t have a password so it&#x27;s pointless and just complicates things.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m trying to make a career change into IT and am currently learning about Active Directory and creating my own. With VirtualBox I created a virtual machine and installed Windows Server 2019 to use as my domain controller. I promoted it to a domain controller and added the AD tools and everything seems fine. 
 With another virtual machine I installed Windows 10 to connect to the domain controller. Everytime I try to connect to the domain I get the error: An Active Directory Domain Controller for the domain could not be contacted. 
  
The domain name is correct and being spelled correctly. 
 I&#x27;ve made sure to change the Windows 10 computer DNS to the IP address of the DC. 
 Both computers are able to ping each other successfully with both IP Addresses and computer names.
 I&#x27;ve disabled the firewall on each computer to ensure certain traffic isn&#x27;t being blocked.
  
After all of this I&#x27;m still getting the same error. Can someone point me in the right direction to what I may be missing?

                              <span>I am in the process of upgrading our current 2012r2 wsus to 2019 along with a bunch of other servers. In the past if a wsus client was not reporting the same status as the wsus server I would run wuauclt/reportnow to trigger the client to report in. 
 I see the command is now deprecated. Is there a new way to update the client status in wsus. Actions taken: reboot check for updates. The client pulls updates and is up to date just not syncing with status in wsus. 
 Any help is appreciated

                              <span>So, our engineers have been tasked with setting up a 12 server (Windows 2019 Server) environment to run software for a manufacturing plant. These were likely member servers that were dis-joined from their domain and placed within their own domain. One of the tasks I was given was to harden the security via GPOs. 
 The second I popped into Group Policy Editor, I was greated with a warning that was something to the effect that it couldn&#x27;t sync (I forgot exactly what it was when I looked at it yesterday). It does appear that it retained some of the previous policies from the previous domain. I created some of the policies like not allowing anonoymous logins and basic objects of that sort, but some of them lost out on the winning GPO that was in place. I deleted a few of them, but they are sticking on the other servers creating issues with service accounts that the software needs to run. I even tried writing new policies to reverse them, but am still having issues with them sticking. 
 I know the proper thing to do would be to rebuild the entire domain, but we don&#x27;t have the time frame given to us to complete. I&#x27;m probably just overthinking this, but is there a way to rip everything out and redo all of the policies? TIA!!!

                              <span>Our environment has 5 hosts, two of which are out of support, a Dell R620 and two R630&#x27;s along with two R740xd&#x27;s that are still supported until late 2025. Our storage arrays are a Dell VNXe 3200 which is long out of support and a Unity 300 and HPE Nimble that are going up next year. My original thought was to replace all of it with a new HCI cluster but there is a fear that it&#x27;s &quot;too much&quot; for our environment of about 40 VMs. As a result, I&#x27;ve been asked to look into a traditional SAN solution to replace it instead. 
 Considering what we have, the most cost-effective option would seem to replacing all 3 storage arrays with 2 new storage arrays, keeping the R740xd&#x27;s while dropping the 3 other hosts, and adding in one new host. It would be the minimum amount of hardware to replace and while it kicks the can down the road on our remaining hosts, we&#x27;d have over two years before they need to be replaced.
 Any thoughts or other suggestions that I may be overlooking?

                              <span>This week i&#x27;ve had a very long argument with our sysadmin over devops (and fundamentally how computers work). Everyone I know in my life is not in IT, so I thought I would talk here as I really need some feedback on this. 
 Put your seatbelts on cause we are boarding the shitshow-express.
 I (fullstack web dev) have proposed to develop an in-house tool using a Flask API and Vue.js frontend as our SAP tools weren&#x27;t cut out for the job (company never did development, but they recognize the utility in a developer so they hired me to improve UI development). My sysadmin has insisted on me deploying it on a Windows machine because &quot;that&#x27;s what we are comfortable with&quot;. Begrudgingly I agreed and asked him if I will be given SSH access. Then following occurred:
  
Syso: &quot;It&#x27;s not secure. You can&#x27;…</span>

I initially thought that it was 192.168.1.31. He showed me the log..it showed 1.168.1.31. Did anyone have similar issue before? Thank you.

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 We&#x27;re all familiar with the warning message we receive when accessing a new server via SSH, indicating that the server&#x27;s hash isn&#x27;t in our known_hosts file. We&#x27;re prompted to type &quot;yes&quot; to confirm access, and once we do, the warning doesn&#x27;t show up again for that server.
 I&#x27;m curious to know if anyone has ever found this warning to be genuinely helpful in their sysadmin career. Has it ever prevented you from connecting to a fake server? In my experience, I always end up typing &quot;yes&quot; when I see this message, even when a server has been rebuilt and its hash has changed. This makes me wonder if the warning is as useful as it&#x27;s intended to be.
 Please share your thoughts and experiences on this topic. Thanks!

                              <span>I am acting as a consultant for a company that is starting from scratch (again). They currently have a large number of physical door keys, key cards, and radios that get checked out to employees for daily operations. Which asset tracking/management software would you recommend so that they can move away from tracking everything with paper and pen?
 Appreciate your time.

                              <span>So our remote users(VPN) have been plagued with strange VOIP problems like loss of audio or choppy audio caused by packet drops for over a month now(The issue is affecting more than just VOIP but VOIP is the most noticeable). We had our providers on calls all day long doing traces to find the issue with no success so far ... Until we came across a comment way low in a BleepingComputer article.
 The comment mentions that enabling the Windows service &quot;Routing and remote access&quot; helped them fix a similar issue.
 We were skeptical as this is usually used on a server and not on workstations, but we tried it anyway and... Well damn... It actually works. All packet drops stopped.
 We are currently working with Microsoft and our VPN provider to identify what the service changes in Windows that affect this issue.
 If you are having strange stability and packet drops on VPN, give that a try maybe.
 Disclamer: I do not know all consequences of enabling this service yet. Use at your own discretion and risk.

 I&#x27;m just having a think just now but this sub is way better than anywhere else for getting a diverse set of opinions.
 Its likely to be 6-10 users needing central user administration and file share management. They are a non profit startup so on a shoestring. As ever I do it stuff so got asked even though been years since I looked at AD. I&#x27;ll likely ask one of my network with recent experience to volunteer here but would be good to know what&#x27;s out there.

                              <span>I mean seriously! I&#x27;ve worked with so many guys that refuse to log support calls unless I badger them for weeks about it.
 Have an issue you can&#x27;t fix straight away?Log the bloody call! You can still work on the issue but if it&#x27;s a bug or a known issue the vendor will know and get it fixed faster.
 Supports costs $10,000s / year &amp; yet some sysadmins take it as a personal insult. Even issues that are urgent and they&#x27;re still working on a week later while users are screaming......oh we&#x27;re still looking into it........LOG THE FUCKING CALL!!! 
 Or even if I want a design answer.....what&#x27;s the packet flow of this software, how does it work and where do the packets go? Oh I&#x27;ll Google that.....weeks later...oh yeah I couldn&#x27;t find anything.....log a fucking call with the vendor!!!!!

                              <span>Hi,
 I was wondering what everyones offboarding procedure is. We are running on-prem AD synced to Azure with AD connect. Moving towards making the on-prem ad redundant. But it takes time and it&#x27;s still used for servers and a bunch of legacy stuff. Either way our offboarding procedure is just weird to me. It works, bjt we have a tonne of disabled users and the number only grows. 
 Currently our procedure is as follows:
  
 Right away:
  
User is disabled disabled
 
Password is reset reset
 
user is removed from all groups (effectivly removing licences as this is applied using groups)
 
user is added to a single group that gives them an exchange online plan 1 license license
 
user is converted to a shared mailbox
 
 -1 other user gets access to their mailbox and 1 forward is made. To the same user or another user( chosen by the manager)
  
 After 2 months:
  
add old_ prefix to users mail address and UPN UPN
 
remove delegation and forward
 
  
 Now i guess my question is, at what point do we just delete the user account? Security are worried that deleting a user will also remove them from our sentinel and other logs. Or at least make it harder to trace the logs. But at some point i think that this is irrelevant. Nobody investigates 12months + old logs?
 How do ylu habdle offboarding?

                              <span>Hi there, I&#x27;m a syadmin at a manufacturing company of about 900 workers and I deal with different types of tasks which go from diagnosing simple support issues up to migrating on prem telephony to teams telephony. I feel like I am technically pretty good but I find myself having tasks or tickets being open for weeks because I can&#x27;t distribute my time on them efficiently. I often spent several days focused on a task and the others get procrastinated on. I feel I could work straight for weeks and never run out of work and I can never shake off the feeling that I&#x27;m not being efficient. My question is, how do you guys manage your time so that there is a healthy balance between your tasks and avoid constantly pushing the &quot;smaller stuff&quot; for later? Should I get into some project managing courses or something?

                              <span>I&#x27;m the sole IT support at a small private school with &lt;50 staff. I deployed a Debian CUPS server for the teachers&#x27; printers so they can print wirelessly instead of the old-fashioned way of bringing over their laptops to plug the USB printers in, and has worked mostly fine.
 New teacher comes in with only an iPad, and any attempt to get AirPrint in CUPS to work has been naught, always returning &quot;You do not have permission to use this printer&quot;. Already spent a couple of days poring through articles online to setting up AirPrint/Bonjour through Avahi, no dice. Avahi is not listening on port 5353 either, and any attempt to print through the iPad or macOS has run into the same authentication error.
 Any ideas on what I&#x27;m missing?

                              <span>I&#x27;m making my first attempt at setting up FOG Server to deploy images for 4 different Windows 11 buildouts that will need to go onto mix of desktops and laptops. I&#x27;ve been able to get all the way through registering an image, but I&#x27;m stuck at deployment. I&#x27;m still trying to figure this thing out, and I feel like I&#x27;m missing something simple.
 I&#x27;m using VirtualBox to create the VMs for the FOG host, FOG server, and the Windows 11 golden image. The FOG host is Ubuntu Server 22.04, FOG Server is version 1.5.10. DHCP is set to the FOG Server IP in 066, and I have 067 set to snponly.efi. On the golden image, I have generic apps (Chrome, Everything, VLC Player, Office365,) as well as larger installs for SolidEdge and AutoCAD Viewer. I went through sysprep and created an answer file for unattended installation for UEFI, and have a volume license key as well, so I&#x27;m covered there. I then was able to successfully register and then capture the image in FOG.
 ​
 Where I&#x27;m stuck: I&#x27;ve tried deploying this on a physical desktop as well as a VM, and this is as far as I get:
 Filename: snponly.efi
 thtp://10.xx.xx.xx/snponly.efi... ok
 snponly.efi : 274944 bytes [PXE-NBP (may be EFI?)]
 Nothing happens beyond that point. I&#x27;ve tried using ipxe.efi as the boot file, and I get the error could not boot image: exec format error. I feel like this is something simple that I&#x27;m overlooking. 
 Any help and/or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>I do pro bono work for a nonprofit organization. They called me on Wednesday morning and informed me that some websites were not working for all users. Additionally, Outlook had issues. Upon investigation, I discovered that major websites like YouTube and Facebook were displaying SSL certificate errors. In the Chrome web console, I noticed recurring reconnection errors. The organization mentioned that they had recently upgraded their Comcast connection and were told that their modem was outdated. Consequently, I advised them to contact Comcast and request a replacement. A technician replaced the modem, tested it, and confirmed that all sites were functioning properly on his PC.
 However, when I reevaluated the situation tonight, I discovered that connecting a PC directly to the modem resulted in the same issue. Changing the DNS settings did not resolve the problem. After spending two hours troubleshooting, I found a temporary fix by enabling DNS over HTTPS, which resolved the issue for everything except Outlook.
 I am aware that this is not a long-term solution. Based on my best guess, this appears to be an issue with Comcast. However, persuading them to acknowledge and address the problem may prove challenging since they rely on the Comcast modem for DNS and DHCP services. Since not all devices support DNS over HTTPS, I need to find an alternative solution.

                              <span>I setup a Ubuntu 22 mail server with Postfix to replace a legacy RHEL server. Everything on the SMTP side works as expected. However, needing help with granting SSH access to clients with signed keys.
 The CA authority signs SSH keys. ssh-rsa and ssh-dss signed keys receive the following error on logs
 &#x27;userauth_pubkey: certificate signature algorithm ssh-rsa: signature algorithm not supported [preauth]&#x27;

 I added the following two lines to the /etc/ssh/sshd_config but did not resolve the issue

 I am not in a position to convert all keys to sha2 at this time, so please help me identify what needs to be changed on the server to temporarily authenticate via ssh-rsa and ssh-dss
 I appreciate any help you can provide.

                              <span>Hi All
 I have been in corporate world in same company for over decade. It was my first corp job and it took few years to establish the 3rd (corp face) when dealing with users and co-workers. 
 Normally I can shrug things off like duck in water but lately we had some close to home lay offs affecting my team and more responsibilities added on. I am feeling distressed due to that fact and can not be emotionless drone with fake feelings about anything anymore. 
 I am asking for the best way to realign my mood and stop caring about the job more then needed. It is hard for me to stop caring or have go to attitude. 
 If I should post this somewhere else please let me know. Thank you and enjoy your 4th

                              <span>Hi All Not really a rant not sure how to say it correctly. My manager is always eager to say where I need to improve on but whenever something good happens I only know via 3rd party. Meaning my manager will praise me to others and upper management but not directly to me. 
 So most of the time I only hear criticism directly but success via another department manager or co-worker. 
 Am i whining or is there miscommunication of some sort?
 We have good working relationship other then that. 
 Any suggestions on how to improve wood be appreciated. Thanks and happy 4th.

I knew they did that to the consumer grade products but was not prepared for enterprise. What is everyone using now? 60 DWPD makes it perfect for the ZIL on a large ZFS NAS or any other abusive/critical services or applications.

 OK, I just got a job, they paid my moving expenses and I started 3 weeks ago.
 In those 3 weeks, 2 weeks of time entries have been changed from around 52 hrs down to 32 &amp; 40 since we are on 9/80 work weeks with every other Friday off. Looks like they missed a week.
 US law applies, so my understanding is that you must submit accurate timesheets regardless of whether you are in a salaried position or not. This has not affected my 2 paychecks so far, but I am concerned about my future reviews and promotions since my work is not being accurately shown.
 I&#x27;m coming to you guys for advice on how to proceed, I am a very direct and confrontational individual and do not want to start off on a bad foot, but feel this is very wrong. I have checked with my immediate supervisor who got a BS answer from HR about payroll only being used to bill vendors. And I have checked with 2 others on my team and their timesheets are correct and accurately reflect their 50 hour weeks, so I am at a loss.
 Thanks guys, I know some great advice is coming my way..
 EDIT: Some of you just really don&#x27;t understand..
 I am being told to lie about the number of hours I work. This is not acceptable period. Not to mention against the law and probably in violation of SOX. 
 With no official record of my time, if something were to happen I have no recourse.
 NM state law is very clear on this matter:
 50-4-9. Records, subpoenas, etc.
 A. Every employer shall keep a true and accurate record of hours worked and wages paid to each employee. The employer shall keep such records on file for at least one year after the entry of the record.

                              <span>I worked 2nd line support for 3 years at my current company. Left for a consultancy gig but one year in an opening appeared for an MS 365 engineer at my precious company. I thought &#x27;hey fuck it, I&#x27;ll just apply to see where I&#x27;m at and learn what I am lacking.&#x27;
 To my surprise I got the job. I&#x27;m now part of the team that I used to escalate things to and ask for help. Awesome. But my teammates all have decades of experience more than me and it shows in meetings. When we go over stuff that we did the past week and have in the agenda, I always feel like it&#x27;s the equivalent of them saying &#x27;I&#x27;ve updated VMware tools, migrated x from our data center to y, configured our Cisco Firepower to do this and that&#x27; and then there&#x27;s me saying &#x27;I deployed my first Autopilot pc.&#x27;
 They knew about my experience, they know what I&#x27;m capable of but I feel like a massive loser in my team. I&#x27;m trying my hardest to gain experience by shadowing them, doing self study about Intune and our whole cloud environment but fuck me, I feel like a junior first line guy all over again.
 I know I&#x27;m not technically a sysadmin but I feel like/hope that some people in here know what I&#x27;m talking about and how to cope.
 Sorry about the rant, I learned so much from you guys on a technical level. Maybe I can get some mental advice too.

 I&#x27;ll start by saying that I work for an MSP that supported our local airport for some specific parts of their infrastructure (we don&#x27;t anymore, thankfully) and one thing I can say is that their servers used for baggage sorting is running on super old citrix machines running Server 2003 OS, and there was no sign that they would upgrade anytime soon. But hey, at least their corporative servers were on Server 2019.
 I&#x27;m interested in some of your stories about just how outdated is infrastructure that we&#x27;re all so reliant on.

                              <span>This is an old vulnerability in exchange online mailboxes. I have noticed that it has been pretty constant with how often we are targeted at my work. I have &quot;User impersonation protection&quot; turned on, which is catching everything that I am aware of. It is a little worrying that this is the only feature holding these messages back. Does anyone have any good recommendations to mitigate this?

                              <span>If you look at the CQURE Hacks 39 video on YouTube, it shows a quick demo of how easy it is to use pass-the-PRT to steal Azure PRT tokens even on a fully patched Windows system with Credential Guard enabled and TPM protections.
 The attack requires local admin access, but that isn&#x27;t an insurmountable obstacle.
 Even if the local user doesn&#x27;t have admin privileges, there are constantly application flaws, driver flaws and OS flaws that can be exploited to allow privilege escalation that would give the attacker local admin rights. Then there is just plain malware and zero day flaws between updates to do this if the attacker gets on a perfectly patched system. Users can be tricked into clicking on malicious links and opening files with malware and there is even occasional malware that requires no user interaction (Malvertisements and Outlook flaws that allow malware to run without even opening the message).
 You can have A/V and EDR to detect and block tools like Mimikatz, but Mimikatz does not need to run locally on the system. In the video, the data is copied to a different system with Mimikatz installed. No hacking tools need to be installed on the system being attacked.
 Besides all that can be done with the local user&#x27;s Azure credentials to send spam and phishing emails and exfiltrate data, if any device admins had entered their credentials into the system (UAC prompt etc.) to assist the user within the last 14 days, their active PRT will also be on the machine and that would give the attacker access to everything the device admin has access to in the tenant.
 This type of attack gets around credential guard and TPM protections and then bypasses all forms of MFA and passwordless authentication (FIDO2 security keys etc.). So, what protection exists to prevent this?

 Looking for insight - does using SSLVPN with RSATokens as the MFA method more or less secure than TOTP via any of the major Authenticator apps?

                              <span>Hey folks! Bit of an odd question/thought exercise, but figured I&#x27;d ask and see if you all have any thoughts/ideas.
 In Linux, you can use PAM (more specifically, pam_ssh_agent_auth) to authenticate to a machine through the use of an SSH agent, thus bypassing the need for a password. Is there anything like it for Windows, i.e. something which would allow you to authenticate/log-in to a computer upon startup - either bypassing or being used in conjunction with a password or other Windows Hello auth method? 
 Without going into too much detail, I&#x27;ve got a working agent, and USB device which stores/generates a pub/priv key pair. Furthermore, I&#x27;ve managed to make an SSH connection to my machine, from my machine. 
 Thanks!

Troubleshooting at startup : after I click troubleshoot/advanced options, all the available options such as boot in safe mode or command prompt are unavailable and I get the message: &quot;You need to sign in as an Administrator to continue, but there aren&#x27;t any administrator accounts on this PC.&quot;
 
Open an elevated command prompt: when I try to run cmd as admin, it prompts me to sign in as admin. In &quot;other options&quot; here it is, my old admin account appears. I enter the pin but it says invalid credentials and prompts me to try again. 
 
 The account still exists in C:/Users.
 I would be immensely grateful for any help on the matter.
 Cheers,

                              <span>Here is the scenario. My wife is a school teacher at a new school. To visualize her new classroom, imagine a square with the white board and smart projector installed on the front wall. 
 The back wall is cabinets and counter tops from one side to the other. Also on the back wall and above the countertops, is the ethernet port for her computer, printer, and the phone line for her classroom phone. The pervious teacher was clearly using the countertop as her desk, which kept her back to the kids, forced her to sit on a stool, and block some cabinets with her desk. 
 Ideally, my wife would like to have her computer/desk at the front of the room, so that she can face her students while at her desk. This would require 30 foot of cords to cross the room. Is there some way to have her computer at the front of the room, without cords, and still be plugged in to the ethernet? 
 Any help or advice would be appreciated.

                              <span>I’m a junior sysadmin in charge of a small network that services 300+ users. The network/domain infrastructure was built by a contracting company and I swear it was designed to be broken from day one. There are 50+ virtualized servers to manage and I barely know anything about them because I came here two years after the installation and the previous sysadmins were hotshots that only applied bandaid fixes so they couldn’t tell me anything of value. The only people that saw how it ran as intended are long gone and I’m stuck piecing together whatever I can with my limited experience. Getting information out of the contracting company is next to impossible because I have to fight my way through their help desk that of course only answer to emails. And even then they are intentionally vague in order to bait my company to pay extra to go fly over to fix whatever’s wrong. I might as well not even be here. The contractors were supposed to build the network then hire junior techs to maintain it but how am I supposed to maintain anything when it’s all hidden behind a contract. I have full access to the network. Im not just a user with limited access. Yet I feel like im running into a new major issue every week and nothing is ever a quick fix or even something I’ve dealt with before. It almost feels like it was engineered to be complicated and they convinced their clients to hire under qualified techs so they can get more money to fly out and be the “subject matter experts”. I’m so sick and tired of this, it’s actually killed my desire to continue working in this field because I’m being set up left and right by these greedy fucks.

The server metrics are fine. Just the commands are slow to respond. I confirmed that it&#x27;s not my server problem by ssh into my cloud server on my another PC which just works like a charm. Why I am I experiencing this and how to resolve this?

                              <span>Basically the title.
 I&#x27;m an IT manager/sysadmin, in charge of a small team for a company of over 200. When it comes to &quot;IT&quot; people, I&#x27;m the top of the organization. My boss is a person who is sort of a catchall for departments that don&#x27;t have a home. They lead a bunch of random &quot;teams&quot; and have no real knowledge or interest in IT at all.
 In previous roles I&#x27;ve had at minimum an IT Director above me who could advocate for IT in the strategy of the organization, even if they weren&#x27;t assisting or super knowledgeable about the tech itself. I&#x27;ve found that without that, IT is very much pushed off to the side and viewed as a bother. Even when we&#x27;re doing projects that are genuinely to assist the staff, no one is taking that up the chain to get buy in from the higher ups.
 Anyone else in a position like this?

                              <span>I have a Dell T630 w/ the redundant SD cards for VMWare. The SD1 card has failed and I need to rebuild the array. In researching this I found these instructions which have a blurb stating &quot;NOTE The rebuild is always sourced from the primary SD card to the secondary SD card.&quot; I have also read on blogs/etc that you just put a new card in the old cards slot and let it rebuild on boot. 
 For anyone that has rebuilt an IDSDM array on an older Dell server running iDRAC 8. Do I need to move the good SD2 card to the SD1 slot, put a replacement card in SD2 and then rebuild -or- can I simply replace SD1 and rebuild?
 ​
 Also, this is my homelab, I know that VMWare on SDCard is not best practice I don&#x27;t need this to devolve into that. I just need to rebuild the array correctly.

                              <span>Filling in netbox for documentation, I do not know what value to put in this field. My understanding from my 5 minutes of research is every building run should have a circuit id associate with it and with comcast, it probably has CBCL somewhere in its name. I know nothing beyond that, and customer service doesn&#x27;t know what a circuit ID is trying to tell me its the wifi SSID when I bring up the CBCL in their format.
 Just trying to document it and fill out everything I can. We would have one right, even if we are just a small business with 1 location, 6 employees on a standard 50mb line.

                              <span>Hello, I am trying to set up failover on an isc dhcp server running on debian 11. DHCP can communicate with each other, but failover does not work.

                              <span>Hello
 I need to prevent a remote desktop session from going into idle. The setting to not logout/disconnect user was already made, but still if I let the window, minimize and work on something else, it shows as idle:
 in cmd: query user /server: MY_SERVER, shows idle after 1 minute of inactivity
 I need to have this active all the time, as a user makes some activity, since I have some scheduled tasks that will run some GUI actions/applications. Also the remote connection will at some point start by itself, if the server gets rebooted or so.
 What I have tried:
 - mouse jiggler
 - caffeine
 - autohotkey scripts (click and pressing keys)
 - powertoys - awake
 -vbs, powershell scripts
 None of them worked. The cmd query still showed idle after one 1 minute
 Am I missing something? Does this have to do with windows being opened (not minimized), or having focus or something else? Is there any tricky thing regarding how windows detects inactivity
 If I have the window not minimized, and something is running (like a mouse jiggler or something) then, the connection is not being shown as idle at all
 Thank you
 ​
 P.S. Hopefully I did not put this into the wrong category. But I did not found one for the remote desktop connection

                              <span>I have been relaxing and taking it super slow for the past few months because I&#x27;ve been under a lot of stress and anxiety. I haven&#x27;t stopped working, nor have I quit doing tickets, deployments, etc but I have taken a much more relaxed and hands-off approach; only doing what needs to be done, not trying to do a million things a day that aren&#x27;t essential.
 But I&#x27;ve realized I&#x27;m taking it a bit to far and not pulling my weight, upholding my obligations. My team isn&#x27;t to bothered by this because they know I do my work when I&#x27;m asked but I don&#x27;t want to become a lazy lard and let it become an issue (could be thinking to much into it).
 Like I said, I&#x27;m not coming back cold turkey. I&#x27;ve been working, but not up to my own standards. (I&#x27;m grateful my team let me do this because I was under stress but I want to get back to help them on more complicated matters like deploying VDI, and a new virtualization stack at another office).
 ​
 Any advice for someone who wants to get back into the saddle and start being more productive?
 [sorry if this isn&#x27;t the right flair, I can fix it if someone tells me what this actually belongs under]

                              <span>was thinking about Cloudflare unfortunately prices are too high. all these sites are getting small traffic. (less than 20GB daily for all sites). many sites are installed Let&#x27;s encrypt SSL certificates. so the solution should capable of SSL offloading + scan (IDS, IPS, anti-virus) PFSense seems does Let&#x27;s encrypt offloading using HAproxy very well. but security is not satisfied like commercial firewalls.

 what do you suggest?

There&#x27;s also a great deal of content out there that violates our advertising/promotion rule, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos.
 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!

                              <span>We are in the process of renewing our RDP deployment in Azure. The current servers are all Server 2012 and since this OS will be end of support by October 2023, we have created a new deployment with all Server 2022 VM&#x27;s.
 We provide our applications within the RDP deployment as RemoteApp. Users can acces the RDWeb page through URL cloud.example.com where they have to login and then see the icon(s) of the applications they can use. 
 When the new environment is fully functional, we will point the DNS server to the IP address of the new RDWeb server, but we are not yet fully ready for that. When we open the RDWeb from within the server, we can login and start an application, but when we try to do that from outside the environment (by IP address, ie https://123.12.3.4/rdweb/pages/en-US/default.aspx) we still can login to the server but applications won&#x27;t open. Instead, an error message is shown:
  
RemoteApp Disconnected 
 Remote Desktop can&#x27;t connect to the remote computer &quot;cb.cloud.example.com&quot; for one of these reasons: 
 1) Your user account is not authorized to access the RD Gateway &quot;cloud.example.com&quot;
 2) Your computer is not authorized to access the RD Gateway &quot;cloud.example.com&quot;
 3) You are using an incompatible authentication method (for example, the RD Gateway might be expecting a smart card but you provided a password) 
 Contact your network administrator for assistance.
  
​
 We are not sure why this is happening. Could this be because we are not accessing the environment by the domain cloud.example.com but by IP address? Any suggestions on where to look at are welcome. 
 Of course, I would prefer to test accessing the RemoteApp over the domain name, but unfortunately this requires help from external parties that are not available to me at the moment.

 I&#x27;ve now changed NPS to these settings:

                              <span>So, this is a bit of a strange one.
 I have a few users who have told me that some e-mails from specific other users are missing. I can find them in my backup and restore them, but the users are 100% sure they don&#x27;t delete them (I know, I know.. ) they just don&#x27;t show up anymore when they search for them in Outlook. 
 Does any of you have any suggestions where to start? I&#x27;ve told the users that Outlook shouldn&#x27;t be used as an archive for important mails, but still, what could cause this? It seems random and has nothing to do with specific dates or mail older than xx, it&#x27;s just completely random &quot;missing&quot; mail in their inbox. 
 Thanks in advance!

 Figured I&#x27;d post this here. It came across my feeds. Good recommendations to keep secure, lots of good practices.
  
This document explains how to integrate security best practices into typical software development and operations (DevOps) Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) environments, without regard for the specific tools being adapted, and leverages several forms of government guidance to collect and present proper security and privacy controls to harden CI/CD cloud deployments

 TLDR: Where to learn
 ​
 I apologise in advance for the broken english.
 I have been helping around at work (small factory) with the IT system and the ways to improve it.
 Since we obtained good results my boss asked me if I wanted to take on the role full time, since the factory is growing and the old IT systems (all LAN cabled, nothing online, no Active Directory, all devices on microsoft HOME 10 and server with no backup as basically a dump-in archive of documents).
 At this point, improving would mean having a site hosted on our server, dividing it in different virtual machines and setting up a DNS to be able to reach it from outside and inside without displaying the Public IP.
 Now, I have learned by myself 3 quarters of the things I&#x27;ll need to do, the only doubt is the DNS part (and everything correlated as HTTP, Certificates ecc..), since I can&#x27;t really understand where to read online.
 In your experience i need to go the old way and spend some nights on youtube/reddit/forums or there is a book/course you can recommend me?
 ​
 Thanks to everyone for reading all this wall text!

                              <span>Hi,
 so basic premise: We are trying to get intune (we probably only need Plan 1) for the Deployment of Laptops and MDM for our iPhones and iPads, together with it being a good tool for inventory and patch management.
 We are a 250 people company at the end of the year with 4 offices in 1 EU Country, that runs Hybrid with a AD Connector and we will have DC in every office. 
  
Are there relevant benefits for us in intune plan 2? 
 
Regarding safety. Expect the conditional access and some nice to have things like Self service password reset. Any opinions on Azure AD P1/P2? We do use the default MFA functions that come with default o365 
 
Some higher ups want to use Windows Hello For business, is this only in M365 E3 and higher? Currently we run on Win-Licenses for the Device not the user

 For a demo I would like to make a fictional printer that has an IP and MAC adress, so I can add it to a centralised tird party print cloud provider. 
 Do you think this is possible? 
 Kind regards

                              <span>Hey i know this isnt exactly the right subreddit but thought i would ask anyway. I recently started a production support engineer position which has me watching for tickets on jira but right now I am only to watch the test q which gets very few tickets. Even fewer are ones I am confident doing right now. For context, I am 2 months into the job. Alot of the days I might do 1 or 2 tickets and somedays I literally get no tickets. Is this normal for a new employee learning the ropes?

                              <span>We are a small team of developers and growing fast. Atm. everyone does a little bit sysadmin work (Microsoft Intune etc.), but more people beeing hired leads to more work. Its a bit chaotic atm. we have some email issues etc. 
 We decided its time to hire a sysadmin. 
 Now with developers the rule is to give them minimal access, which is required to do their tasks. 
 This rule does not translate well for a sysadmin. He will need full access to our microsoft environment and he will need access to our mail domain account, so he can tweak DNS settings etc. Thats a lot of access.
 I am curious how other companies handle that? Do you give so much access on day 1 or do you give him smaller projects to build trust first?
 Currently I am planing to give him full access to the microsoft environment, but not to DNS settings. Here he has to work with us.

 S1 support just asks us to exclude the file. What.

                              <span>Hey all,
 we are about to pull the trigger on SentinelOne. 
 We have some doubts on our reseller (EU based). 
 Are there different SKUs for S1 for server and clients? Our reseller insists that there are and they are charging double for those. Apparently the modules are not different in those descriptions. 
 I do not have any access to distributor or other resellers. Could you please just confirm that there are or not those different SKUs.
 ​
 Thank you all in advance.

                              <span>Hello sysadmins,
 We are having an issue in our environment with update KB5014754 (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5014754-certificate-based-authentication-changes-on-windows-domain-controllers-ad2c23b0-15d8-4340-a468-4d4f3b188f16).
 All our DCs have the security patch installed and when our users try to login with their certificate (using a SmartCard), event 39 is being logged on the event log. We are trying to create a strong certificate binding with the AD attribute altSecurityIdentities (issuer + serial number) but it&#x27;s not working, the event 39 keeps showing after updating the attribute:
 - altSecurityIdentities &#x3D; &#x27;X509:C&#x3D;ES,O&#x3D;(redacted),OU&#x3D;(redacted),OID.2.5.4.97&#x3D;(redacted),CN&#x3D;(redacted)(inverted SN)&#x27;
 We have tried to configure the altSecurityIdentities in several different ways, we have added the certificate to the user on AD and a we have done a lot of different tests, but event 39 keeps appearing, so we are a little bit lost. Do you know where could we investigate further or what could be the cause for event 39 still being logged?
 Thank you!

                              <span>Hi, mainly speaking for NA, a customer is asking their server room to be re-managed/rebuilt.
 ​
 All the system, cables everything is about 20 years old and all of the things inside is out. The room has no cabinet, old pc cases etc. 
 ​
 What I have to do is take the shelves to outside of the room to make up space, build 42U Cabinet, build 2x48 Port switch, couple patch panels, build some rack servers or a workstation. And then move the ups, file server and rest pc&#x27;s to the cabinet, reconnect them. Remake about 20-30 cable connectors, label each of them. 
 ​
 In total cables are about 50 and they only said not to replace the whole cable. Only I can move and make a new connector.
 ​
 The thing is I said to them I would check the parts and prices for them, will not get a commission. 
 It is roughly 5-day job and I am not familiar with the market. New in the country(US-CA) so I would have some opinions if you could just guide me.
 ​
 Thanks a lot!

                              <span>Like when a user or even a fellow IT employee says something that is just way off base, like suggesting a bad solution to a problem. I always just say &quot;nah that doesn&#x27;t really make sense&quot; in what I feel is a polite/chill and non-condescending tone, but there&#x27;s the nagging feeling in the back of my mind that I&#x27;m putting them down or being rude unintentionally. Am I overthinking, or is there a more professional way to phrase this?

If I map it as a drive letter in Windows File Explorer - everything works fine.
 If I type it into the address bar of Windows File Explorer - it doesn&#x27;t resolve.
  
This doesn&#x27;t apply to all our DFSNs, just the ones in the &quot;share1&quot; folder.
 Any ideas?

 TLTR: Used SFC and it fixed an Outlook XLSX attachments and shared files issue.
 I spent 2 days troubleshooting what appeared to be a minor problem: MS Excel would not show who was editing a file (any file) if this specific user tried to open it while it was being edited by somebody else. Files are stored on a Windows Shares. This went on for a few weeks as the user didn&#x27;t really inform IT until this next problem:
 A couple days ago, the user got tired of Excel telling her there were files recovered and answered &quot;No&quot; to not keeping them. The problem above turned to &quot;File is corrupted&quot; when she tried to open any file that was opene…</span>

 My typical branch office networks are a single closet with an ISR4k router with one or two 48port access switches behind it. The ISR has a DIA circuit, a private WAN circuit, and the 3rd interface connects to the switch fabric.
 I&#x27;ve got one site that has a crap ton of access ports. The current setup has 5 switches daisy chained using the 10Gb uplink ports. It has been working well enough, but the hardware is up for a refresh, and I&#x27;m curious if &quot;there&#x27;s a better way&quot;.
 The traffic is relatively low, maybe 30~ computers, and about the same or a few more VoIP phones and printers.

 My question is, can I use my Simplex-Singlemode LC/UPC to LC/APC I currently own, or do I need to buy this specific cable? In a lot of websites I can&#x27;t filter for this specific cable, so I am not sure whether it&#x27;s any different as images of these 2 cable seems to be exactly the same.

                              <span>I’m just trying to confirm that on XR the MTU includes the Ethernet headers etc. So to get a payload of 1500 bytes we would need to set the MTU to 1514 correct?
 Also, from what I understand adding a subinterface will automatically add another 4 bytes making the MTU 1518.
 Is this correct?

                              <span>Got a performance review back today and apparently got maximum points everywhere but customer service. Issue is it is claimed I am too fast to say &quot;not the network.&quot; Crazy thing is I cannot remember one time I said &quot;not the network&quot; and was wrong. Someone says, &quot;it&#x27;s a routing issue&quot; and I am like, &quot;um there are 600 other endpoints in that subnet... if it was a routing problem, none of them would work.&quot; OR I send the ticket back... &quot;What have you done to troubleshoot? Sounds like an authentication issue ... the network isn&#x27;t broken just because the supplicant on the device isn&#x27;t doing 802.1x properly, or it isn&#x27;t joined to the domain OR it isn&#x27;t getting the group policy. All those things aren&#x27;t the network.
 Ultimately, I deployed ISE securing the network and now everything on my side is working but others blame the network each time a device cannot authenticate. It&#x27;s like I secure the network and do my part then when it doesn&#x27;t work, they are mad at me when I don&#x27;t&#x27; manage devices and pass it back to the useless teams that do nothing whatsoever but pass every damned ticket to our NOC. I cannot single handedly deal with every individual devise that acts up out of 50,000 total each time a devices cannot connect to the network.
 Am I wrong for not wanting to do a bunch of handholding for IT people?

                              <span>Hello Cisco Experts,
 I bought the following part numbers thinking I would get two sup (for redundancy) in the switch. When the equiopment arrived, I only received 1 Sup, the chassis, and two line cards. I&#x27;ve opened a case my vendor and awaiting a response.
 C9410R-96U-BNDL-A
 c9400-sup-1xl-b
 Unfortunatley, Cisco&#x27;s website does not provide information regarding this.

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m preparing for a computer communication exam and want to make sure I am calculating subnets correctly.
 Let&#x27;s say I have the IP 129.19.40.0/25. I am told to subnet it into three subnets: A, B, and C, where:
  
A has 11 hosts
 B has 12 hosts
 C has 45 hosts
  
Is the following approach correct?
  
Take log₂(#hosts + 2) -- adding 2 for network ID and broadcast addresses. So for instance in the case of subnet A I get: log₂(13) &#x3D; 3.7 --&gt; and rounding up I find that I need 4 bits.
 Then I take the number of bits and adjust the subnet mask accordingly, so again in the case of subnet A instead of using /25 I would use /28 (because the 4 LSB are 0)
 Now I want to find the range of IPs for the subnet, so for subnet A I will start from 129.19.40.1 (since .0 is reserved) and go til 129.19.40.14. The addresses ---.1 and ---.14 here will be the network ID and broadcast addresses, respectively.
 Repeat this process for the remaining subnets, resulting in:
  
 Subnet B: Range &#x3D; 129.19.40.15 - 129.19.40.29, subnet mask \28
 Subnet C: Range &#x3D; 129.19.40.30 - 129.19.40.77, subnet mask \26
  
Thank you in advance to anyone willing to either confirm or correct the above :)

                              <span>So i am operating 3 data halls worth of equipment and need to connect to the power busway in all three data halls. There are 
 DH1- 48 connections
 DH2 - 48 connections
 DH3 - 96 connections
 I am figuring on 4 Cisco Meraki MS120-48 connected to Cisco Meraki MS410-16 for aggregation and connection to our existing network. 
 Networking isn&#x27;t my strongest suit, we currently use Cisco Meraki for all our other switches. That is why they were selected, but i need very little management, and the traffic requirement is pretty low, based on it just being modbus data. If i can do it much cheaper with &quot;dumber/cheaper&quot; devices, is it worth it?

 MSTP is running on all switches. If I turn it off on switch (a), my SIP packet from my phone to 224.0.1.75 makes it to the server. If I turn it back on, it blocks it.
 When MSTP is on, the port state does not change from forwarding. There are no loops.
 Some part of MSTP blocking multicast. Any ideas?

To compensate for shoddy internet access in some of the places we visit, I have Verizon hotspot (no Ethernet port), and Tmobile hotspot (with Ethernet port). I also have Starlink (with Ethernet port). I’m looking for a small router that has a wireless WAN port and two wired WAN ports, that can decide based on link quality, which WAN port to use. I have both 12v and 120V in the rig. I also have a WeBoost RV system to boost cellular signal. Appreciate any ideas.

 I have a portchannel with two 10Gig ports. There are two VLANs in trunk in this portchannel and I would like to limit the bandwidth for the vlan as follows:
 VLAN1990 - Allocated 1Gbit
 VLAN1991 - Allocated 19Gbit
 VLAN1990 is vlan with multicast TV service, when the other VLANs traffic is more than 19Gbit, it causes the disruption of TV service.
 I tried to create the class-map with &quot;match vlan 1990&quot; but this command is apparently not available on C4900M, we are running:

 Is there any way to have the bandwidth allocated?

                              <span>Currently, our team is heavily invested in the process of having field cabling installed. Our approach looks something like this:
  
Ticket arrives requesting additional cabling/outlets from our Service Desk
 
If required, we will visit the site and determine the exact location and placement of the outlets based on the requirements of the customer
 
We take those requirements and feed them to an external cabler for a quotation (Cablers are vetted and know our Standard)
 
Once the quotation is provided we pass this to the end customer and let them review it and decide if they want to proceed
 
If the customer ends up proceeding with the quotation, we will work with our Facilities Maintenance to organize Fire isolation
 
Once the cabling is installed, we will visit the site and patch in outlets, and provide patch leads for the work area
 
 During this process, we are documenting and recording details and keeping a register of all information collected (Quote, Request details, Cable test results etc.). We&#x27;re doing this about 2-3 times a week. I find this is somewhat &quot;low value&quot; work I&#x27;m wondering if others push this to their facilities team and only interface in this work as a point of escalation?
 Some of the drawbacks to doing this:
  
Staff are fickle, things change and a single site visit can turn into multiple
 
Stuff changes, cabling can be installed as requested, and then a project changes its mind and the desks are now on the other side of the room
 
Sometimes with this work, you become a defacto project manager because the cabling is in the critical path
 
There are only so many hours in the day while doing this work... you&#x27;re not deploying new kit or working on audits and cleanups
 
This process is followed by our Junior and Senior Engineers alike

                              <span>Hey guys：
 We have some standalone ESXi hosts in our company. Recently we encountered a werid issue where the mac address of the ESXi host flapping.
 Issue description:
 I found that the IP of some esxi hosts will occasionally be unable to ping, but the vm network on the host will not be interrupted. At this time, if you ping the IP of the ESXi host on a server in the same VLAN, the ESXi host network will be restored.
 At first, I thought it was due to the EEE function of the NIC. So I upgraded ESXi version(ESXi 6.5 -6.7-7.0), disabled the igbn driver and enabled the ign driver, disabled EEE function but these did not work.
 I finally found that when the issue occurred, ESXi host MAC would flap to G2/1 port. G2/1 port is connected to Sangfor Access Control Device and AC device is connected…</span>

                              <span>I have bought ISR 4331 and 8Gb flash. ISR boots normally without additional flash, but an error occurs after flash installation: “Invalid License Detected”. Has anyone encountered this problem?

                              <span>Hi everyone, I have an unorthodox situation I&#x27;m trying to figure out. I&#x27;m going to give a very simplified version of the problem I am trying to solve, for simplicity purposes.
 I hope that the smart people here can help me out so that I don&#x27;t need to buy and install additional copper NICs.
 We are in the midst of a network re-design so I am trying to make do with what we have at this current time to try to make my new server function. In a nutshell, I want to combine what used to be two copper access ports from two physically separate networks to a single SFP connection which my new server has, and assign them to my VMs by VLAN. 
 Old scenario:
 I have an old server that had 2 copper NICs each connected to respectively 2 physically separate networks. The access ports come from Cisco 2960X without VLANs configured. At this time, it is not possible to have these reconfigured.
 On the server, NIC1/Network 1 was attached to VM1, and NIC2/Network 2 was attached to VM2.
 This has worked fine for years.
 New scenario:
 I have a new server that only has 1 SFP port.
 Is there a way I can combine or (reverse) trunk these two networks so that my new server can see either network depending on what VLAN I assign to each VM?
 I tried to create two access ports, Port1 on VLAN10 for Network 1, and Port 2 on VLAN 20 for Network 2. I then connected Port 24 (SFP Trunk) to my new server. This didn&#x27;t seem to work.
 I have been toying with the scenario and it doesn&#x27;t work. I know I must be doing something silly, but I feel like there should be a way to make it functional.
 I have a diagram drawn up of my test design but I can&#x27;t seem to upload it yet as I might be too new.
 Hope someone can help!
 Thank you!

                              <span>I&#x27;m working for a company that has oil wells spread across several thousand acres of land. There are thousands of wells, which encompass miles of land. 
 We&#x27;re installing devices on the wells that will provide measurements for what is going on. However, we need some kind of network to get the data to our offices. 
 We have a separate electrical grid that supplies power to all of the wells, so that is not an issue. 
 What is the best solution here? Is there way to have a giant mesh network with thousands of nodes all connected to each other over this giant acreage? What are some possibilities for creating such a network?

                              <span>I have a S3400-48T4SP switch and mainly bought it for the POE side for a project I am working on. That being said, I see it has what appears to be a DHCP server on board. Has anyone ever used their DHCP server in general?The config seems straightforward but when trying to actually obtain an address on a port, the clients are not succesful. Haven&#x27;t done any fancy packet captures and so on yet, just trying to see if there are obvious things to look out for as the documentation is a bit sparse.
 THIS IS A BUSINESS TOPIC.

 This agrees with &#x27;netsh dhcp server scope ...&#x27;
 But, since 0% is available now new clients are being thrown to APIPA. 
 No changes recently on this scope - and this isn&#x27;t the only scope that has this. Not many are showing this, but a couple.
 Any suggestions on threads to pull on?
 EDIT: Reboot didn&#x27;t help. About half of scopes on this server are in this state, but a whole lot of the main and important scopes are not. Which is nice. Any device attempting to receive an address from this scope just doesn&#x27;t receive an offer. They&#x27;re shouting into the wind and no one listens. Change that VLAN to a working one and it works just fine. 
 Apparently the only difference is that one of my coworkers is working with split scope and a failover server (this is currently only the up and coming DHCP server that&#x27;s going to replace an RHEL server that&#x27;s still shouldering most of the load right now).

 Good day folks, Need some help related to a networking issue. I’m in no way an expert or even half decent in these things, so bear with me if some things I say makes no sense. 
 For reference, Im onboard a Cargo ship in the Pacific and we’re facing internet issues, specifically with WiFi onboard. I’ve posted a picture ( link at start) trying to explain as best as I can. 
 We have Starlink internet installed onboard, and the internet goes through a Data centre ( In picture). The main internet cable from starlink goes in to the ZWANA firewall ( red box). 
 From Zwana, the cable goes to the back of HPE Officeconnect 1920S Series switch ( Idk what this box is, but as shown in the pic all other equipment’s that need internet onboard are connected here).
 From here ( HPE …</span>

                              <span>I&#x27;m using netmiko so do work on remote devices in other countries. Some of them have very large configs on them and when I do a show run on these devices, it&#x27;s timing out. I can see in the logging that it&#x27;s doing the show run, but eventually it just times out the netmiko connection.
 I have tried a few iterations of running the command but no luck:
 sh_run &#x3D; net_connect.send_command_expect(&#x27;show running-config&#x27;, expect_string&#x3D;r&#x27;#&#x27;, delay_factor&#x3D;2, max_loops&#x3D;600) sh_run &#x3D; net_connect.send_command_expect(&#x27;show running-config&#x27;, expect_string&#x3D;r&#x27;#&#x27;) 
 Update:
 I forgot to mention, I have also tried having a really long timeout with: &#x27;global_delay_factor&#x27;: in the connect handler settings but that doesn&#x27;t help either.
 ​
 This is the error:
 raise ReadTimeout(msg)
 netmiko.exceptions.ReadTimeout:
 Pattern not detected: &#x27;tz\\-core\\-rtr\\-1\\#&#x27; in output.
 It looks like it&#x27;s timing out because it doesn&#x27;t see the router prompt quick enough and times out.
 Anybody had similar issues and were able to work around this?
 ​
 Thanks

 I&#x27;ve heard that the London market pays significantly less than other cities.
 Does anyone have any info?

                              <span>We&#x27;re looking at doing a refresh for our firewalls. For budget reasons our two main contenders seem to be Fortigate and Checkpoint.
 General office setup: no fancy routing so the edge devices will connect directly to the ISP over 10 Gig. Probably won&#x27;t need BGP, but if we do in the future, it won&#x27;t be any fancy (one ASN, one block of IPv4/6). Some SSL VPN will be used, but not heavily.
 Currently there will be only one fibre, but we&#x27;ll probably get a second unit as a warm stand-by, so if the primary goes sides ways we could perhaps just move the fibre over. We may go with a second uplink later.
 Any preferences for Fortigate and Checkpoint? Palo Alto is often recommended, but that&#x27;s a bit too much for us; Fortigate generally is also mentioned, but I&#x27;m curious about Checkpoint.
 Our co-lo DC will also probably need a refresh soon-ish, so we may go with the same vendor there as well. It&#x27;s also currently 10Gig without HA. There we may stay with 10 Gig with the refresh, or perhaps go with a 100 Gig optic: not so much for the extra bandwidth, but for easier work with regards to provisioning and port availability: any difference with Fortigate and Checkpoint for 100G?
 Thanks for any info.
 (Internally the office gear will be access-layer PoE switches, APs, and a small server room. More familiar with switching gear, so have a good feel for the options.)

I notice they have run it in some of our cable trays and am concerned it may cause crosstalk. This is replacing an older leaky install that was not run in cable trays so that gives me another reason to question the new install. The contractor says no, but we want a second opinion. Thanks!

 I&#x27;m not sure where to turn to but, since this is about my network rack, I&#x27;d thought I&#x27;d ask here. If there is a more appropriate place to ask, please let me know.
 I need to install an Eaton 5P 3000 UPS in a two post rack. The posts are 6.5 inches on the side. I&#x27;m not having luck finding rails/mounting hardware for that. The searches turn up rails for server racks and I can&#x27;t use those here. I got something from my Eaton vendor, PN 103007018-5591, but they are only 3.5 inch so too small. He wasn&#x27;t much help beyond that. Does anyone have any suggestions here?

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;ve been labbing VMware sdwan in eve-ng and for some reason I can&#x27;t run diagnostic from orchestrator gui. Gateway is up, velocloud edge is up, edge has internet access, I could push config successfully but diagnostics just doesn&#x27;t work. I&#x27;m running version 5.1.0
 When I try to run remote diagnostics I get message
 Connection to the Edge for running diagnostics is closed. Try reconnecting.. 
 Diagnostic from cli is working ok
 ​
 edge:site1-vce1:~# debug.py --gateways [ { &quot;CDE Enabled&quot;: false, &quot;Controller&quot;: false, &quot;IPSec gateway IP Addr&quot;: &quot;N/A&quot;, &quot;Local Gateway&quot;: true, &quot;LogicalId&quot;: &quot;df5509bd-45c7-4e90-9a1f-aab030d0d898&quot;, &quot;Name&quot;: &quot;dc1-vpg1&quot;, &quot;Peer State&quot;: &quot;ALIVE&quot;, &quot;Primary Global GW&quot;: true, &quot;Private IP Address&quot;: &quot;N/A&quot;, &quot;Private IPv6 Address&quot;: &quot;::&quot;, &quot;Public IP Address&quot;: &quot;82.14.0.3&quot;, &quot;Public IPv6 Address&quot;: &quot;::&quot;, &quot;State&quot;: &quot;ACTIVE&quot;, &quot;Type&quot;: &quot;Public&quot;, &quot;cws capable&quot;: false, &quot;cws primary gateway&quot;: false, &quot;epType&quot;: 16, &quot;mtgre capable&quot;: false, &quot;mtgre primary gateway&quot;: false, &quot;onPremise&quot;: &quot;No&quot;, &quot;private_network_id&quot;: 0, &quot;super_alt_gw&quot;: false, &quot;super_gw&quot;: true } ] 
 Any help or opinion is more than appreciated

                              <span>I am trying to write a script using python to automatically generating a diagram for our network, but I haven’t find any good tutorials or sample scripts online using python (netmiko). Though I am beginner in scripting. 
 Because we have entire SA network sites. It’s awful and time consuming for me to manually draw the network diagram using MS VISIO. 
 I want to pull the info via LLDP, so output of the diagram could include the following: all devices mainly switches with their names, IP address of each switch, trunk links, ports numbers. 
 Any suggestions/recommendations/sample scripts. 
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi all,
 I posted here a while back and it took me in some interesting research directions. Today, though, I come with a different issue. Say I have a nice SNMP v3 all set up, properly running queries and receiving info. I am working from the command line and I&#x27;m sending stuff like snmpget -u username -l authPriv -a bla -A bla and so on.
 I read in the docs that I should be able to store all the credentials in the snmp.conf file and just run the command like snmpget host:port mib::oid, but this is not working - it just times out with no response from the host. Meanwhile, when providing everything in the command line and cleaning my snmp.conf everything works as expected. Any thoughts on where I&#x27;m screwing up, or how I can actually use the credentials from a file instead of the command line?
 Thank you!

                              <span>I&#x27;ve been tasked with creating the most simple file share possible. Basically we&#x27;re looking for a solution that a quick link and login where people can drop files to be shared with the rest of the group. I&#x27;ve also been asked to included a calendar.
 My first thought was to enable quick connect on our synology NAS and only allow these users access to a specific folder and calendar. However, I&#x27;m a little leery exposing our NAS to the internet like this. 
 Any suggestions?

                              <span>I&#x27;m willing to purchase Xiaomi Mi Router 4C (White), 300 Mbps router but have something to clarify before purchasing it.
 So, I have a fibre internet connection and a WiFi router which gives me around 200Mbps - 300Mbps of speed with Ethernet connected. But it drops to 15Mbps - 60 Mbps with WiFi while I&#x27;m just 1m away from the router. To be specific, it is a ZTE ZXFHN F660 Fibre router which I think has a crappy WiFi connection.
 By purchasing this Xiaomi Mi Router 4C (White), 300 Mbps router I&#x27;m willing to get a better internet speed with WiFi. At least more than 100Mbps.
 Do you guys it will be able to do that?

                              <span>Hi, I am new here but I know basic networking stuffs. Please excuse me if my question sounds very noob-like or stupid.
 Our offices are situated inside basement. 1 is an elevated office, 1 is on the basement level. Both offices are about 300 meters away. Cabling cannot be done due to structural restrictions however I can see the other office in sight from the elevated office. We&#x27;re getting business wireless internet installed in the elevated office. I was hoping if anyone can suggest what would be the best wireless router that can reach the other office easily. I heard mesh WiFi works best here but between 2 offices, there is an empty space where you cannot connect any mesh router in between to keep the signal strong. Or there has to be a long range 1 directional router that has like 500m to 1km range like a radar but should not be too expensive.
 Please help. Thank you!

                              <span>A little context on the situation:
 Our ISP service is fiber, and is delivered via an ONT aka modem. 
 ​
 The service is VLAN trunked to deliver:
 - Internet VLAN 10
 - IPTV VLAN20
 - Voice VLAN30
 - Management VLAN40
 It is supposed to be delivered to a ISP provided gateway.
 ​
 So to break this apart, we put in a managed L2 switch a SG200-08 in between to run our firewall(s)
 For management and security:
 - Management VLAN1 (Port 8 - yes i know but its a small mom and pop business - please ignore)
 - ISP Untagged (nothing delivered on this) - VLAN9 (only port1)
 - ISP tagged VLAN10/20/30/40 (trunked on port 1)
 - Port 2-3 (untagged VLAN10)
 ​
 For some weird reason I&#x27;m trying to comprehend, it had worked fine over the months/years.
 Recently, I get complaints of Whatsapp calls not going through / not connecting.
 I&#x27;ve since:
 - changed to another router Ubiquiti Edgerouter (on the same setup above) plugged to both port 2 or 3
 Same result.
 ​
 Removing the SG200, and going back with the ISP router - issue resolved.
 ​
 Here comes the kicker, putting in a Mikrotik RB260GS - the issue vanishes - with both Edgerouter and exisitng firewall. 
 ​
 The minute the SG200 is in the picture, the setup fails.
 ​
 Any ideas?

 Currently using Alcatel AP but I want to change some to cisco AP. Is roaming between different vendor APs smooth under the following conditions? If roaming is possible but not perfect conditions are also welcome. I look forward to hearing from you:)

 Lots of high rise buildings do eco cooling on the weekends but unlike office space, machine rooms don’t take a day off. Have you had luck tying into dedicated cooling loops?

                              <span>I had to move my test lab to a new location, and with it I had to setup a new VPN to remotly access it. Only thing I have available currently is an ASA. I simply have a public IP given and that&#x27;s all. I have a single /24 network for my internal net, and my WAN setup. My internet net stuff needs to be able to reach the internet, and I need to be able to reach it over the VPN.
 ​
 I setup a remote access ssl vpn to connect to with anyconnect. However, it fails to connect to anything internally because the internal network uses PAT to go out the WAN. So I setup another NAT rule to exempt translation when going from outside to inside (i&#x27;m not sure why this is default) and this works to access everything behind the firewall, I just can&#x27;t directly manage the firewall from the VPN, it tells me routing failed to locate the next hop.
 ​
 Is this the best way to apporach this? It feels a little wonky.

                              <span>I’ve got a bit of a unique deployment that I’m hoping to get some advice on. For context, I work for an event production company. We provide audio, video, lighting, etc. for large corporate events. I work primarily with our audio stuff, but also handle a lot of networking since that’s what I went to school for and did in a previous life.
 We’re expanding the kits we send to do temporary production network deployments on show sites. These networks provide audio transport, audio/video/lighting control, intercom, internet, wireless printing, etc. It’s all VLAN’d out and there’s a good bit going on. We’re getting all new switches and finally adding Wi-Fi access points. The APs are what have me wracking my brain.

                              <span>Hi,
 I recently got hired as the sole IT guy in a very tiny company with 8 employees.
 The situation looks as follows:
  
Each employee uses THEIR OWN PC (except for myself) for all of the work that they do. Those PCs are all MacBook pros. There are no onsite PCs at the office (besides the one I use).
 The company uses OneDrive as its storage of ALL company files, except for some confidential documents such as employee contracts. Those are stored on the boss&#x27; own PC, and that&#x27;s it...
 All of the employees at the company are tech-illiterate, including the boss.
 Each user has the OneDrive application installed on their PC so it can sync the OneDrive files with their PCs file manager.
 None of the OneDrive directories are compartmentalized. Despite the employees being responsible for differe…</span>

                              <span>Maybe this is just my own personal trigger, but i just don&#x27;t understand why a good portion of our employees (even some on our own IT team) feel like everything they click on must be done with a double click? i can understand users getting confused because certain things like navigating file shares and what not do require double clicks, but you&#x27;d think if you use a computer at your job for 6-8 hours a day you&#x27;d grasp the concept that not all things on computers need a double click.
 I&#x27;ve seen it all too often in my years of support tickets where someone will get angry because they always end up opening 2 of everything in their taskbar and can&#x27;t fathom the thought that its because they are double clicking on pinned icons because &quot;double clicking works for most things&quot;. makes ya just wanna scream right?
 Went over the edge today because I was training up one of our members of the service desk on usage of one of our web apps. a good friend of mine and we&#x27;ve been working together for years. he double clicks on EVERYTHING! and It just so happens that in this web app ... when you double click on a particular menu, it opens another window in browser ... which for this dude he was opening 2 windows every time. i keep telling him for years to stop double clicking on anything in a web browser because you dont need to, but y&#x27;know ... he still does and jokes about the web app just being crappy....which to an extent i get, but still maybe start with kicking the impulse to stop double clicking on everything your mouse is on??
 Am i alone here or is anyone else quietly dealing with this for their user base?

 &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about that, whatever we save in on prem, we can use for upgrade&quot;
 &quot;Shouldn&#x27;t we upgrade first?&quot;
 &quot;Let&#x27;s just see how it goes&quot;
 &quot;Okay..., if you insist...&quot;

 &quot;All done, clouded and automateded&quot;
 &quot;But why is everything so slow?&quot;
 &quot;Because we&#x27;re saturating our bandwidth&quot;
 &quot;Can&#x27;t we move some stuff out of hours?&quot;
 &quot;Everything is already out of hours where possible&quot;
 &quot;Compression? &quot;
 &quot;We do that already, we need to increase bandwidth&quot;
 &quot;What about...&quot;
 &quot;We&#x27;re doing everything we can. Including blocking high bandwidth application profiles on the Firewall. Yes there&#x27;s been complaints about YouTube.&quot;
 &quot;Aah. Perhaps I&#x27;ll get a consultant...&quot;
 ...
 ...
 &quot;The consultant asks if we&#x27;ve considered moving some stuff on prem...&quot;
 Just do that damn traffic analysis...

                              <span>Currently looking for a new backup solution and narrowed down to Rubrik and Cohesity. 
 What do you all recommend? We understand they both support vSphere the same but we also use Nutanix AHV. I have heard Cohesity isn&#x27;t as &#x27;fully featured&#x27; in the AHV side of things, is this true? If so, what can&#x27;t you do in Cohesity that you can do in Rubrik?

                              <span>This is very multi disciplinary - but say one had an enterprise data centre using about 300kW steady-state, could one feasibly divert the heat output via water cooling to a swimming pool 180 metres down the road?
 I mean - anything is possible, but is this practical? Say you had to replace all of the servers anyway over the next 5 years, buying in water-cooled servers is doable. The work would be, in my head:
 compatible cabinets
 add a cooling loop
 dig a trench between the DC and the pool
 &quot;hook it up&quot; at either end
 make sure there&#x27;s some cooling via traditional coolers for when the pool is the right temp
 Am I missing something that&#x27;s really obvious? Is the carbon effort of the road/pavement digging never going to be recouped for example? Does anyone know how to work this kind of thing out?

                              <span>Working with a larger org right now and the network is laid out as a hub and spoke topology where the spokes can&#x27;t talk to each other. There was a plan to put a DC at each site so users can authenticate to machines in the event of a link failure back to the hub. The AD team is saying this network topology doesnt work because all DCs need to be able to talk to each other for replication. I&#x27;m not an AD guru by any means, but isn&#x27;t this the purpose of having different AD sites?

                              <span>Hello. I ran a Nessus can against our machines and had the Sweet32 vulnerability. I found an article that explained how to fix the issue by adding registry keys to disable the RC4 and 3DES, which I did for one of our domain controllers. My colleague then tells me that no new devices can be added to the domain (works when the domain controller is shut down and the other DC is used).
 I don&#x27;t know if this is a coincidence or whether it had actually broken the server. Has anyone had issues after doing this fix?

                              <span>Personally I used TeamViewer for my home computers and family that I would assist. Recently they dropped the max clients to 3, which doesn&#x27;t work. Looking around I found DWS Remote Control. Web based control. Installed it on a VM, seems to work really really well. And it&#x27;s 100% no matter what (they just limit the bandwidth). You can pay for subs to support them and you get higher bandwidth.
 My question is this: Has anyone heard of them? Heard bad things (security and that fun stuff)? I had never heard of them until this week and for a free product that works this well, too good to be true kind of thing.
 We pay for Dameware MRCC now and it &quot;works&quot;, has little issues now and then but I was thinking of talking to my team about switching. Just want to make sure it&#x27;s not known for being insecure and all that stuff we are paid to worry about.
 Thanks for any input!

 I ask because I&#x27;d really like to be able to just give a YubiKey to a user and off they go. After testing out the self-enrollment process.....this is going to be frustrating for a lot of my users.
 EDIT: Sorry...this is for Azure AD multi-factor authentication.

 The documentation really sucks and doesn&#x27;t inform you well what&#x27;s needed to enter all requirements successfully.

 I fully recognize that every environment needs its policies tailored to its business needs, but does anyone have a good resource for a starting point?

                              <span>Hi,
 We’re decommissioning exchange 2013. All mailboxes and routing to and from have stopped. Server been offline for7 days now (we wanted to see the impacts once it was removed). What’s our next step? We have ADSync which can create new users from AD (or just go cloud). We have power shell scrips ready to maintain what we have (e.g. global address list). I’m hesitant to just uninstall exchange server all as there’s no undo for that. Note: I am more of a jr sys admin so anything will help.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello everyone. I have an issue with a Macbook that we have set up through Apple Business Manager/Intune. The problem is that the person cannot download any applications from the App Store. All the &quot;get&quot; buttons are grayed out.
 Now, one would naturally expect that this is a permissions-related issue. However, the other Macbooks that were set up in the same way do not have this problem!
 The Macbook is already running the latest version of macOS, and everything else is up to date. Any ideas?

                              <span>I have a client that has a .ws domain that they bought years ago with Registrar.com, but wanted to try to migrate as I wasn&#x27;t fond of their UI and most feedback on them is not great. I was trying to find a decent registrar that I could transfer their domain to, but not having much luck. Cloudflare that I normally use for domains doesn&#x27;t support that TLD. A couple of registrars I was searching either didn&#x27;t support the TLD or wanted a decent chunk to make an offer, which seems odd as you would think that you could transfer it once you unlocked it like any offer TLD. Any suggestions for a worthwhile registrar for this?

                              <span>I’m receiving a constant supply of “genuine emails” but not for things intended for me.
 A handful of folks seemingly across the globe, are using the address of my gmail account for things like car hire, hotel stays, travel tickets…
 I fail to believe this is a genuine typo, based on the constant and multiple usage…
 My account is protected with 2FA with Yubikey and there’s no bizarre location/device history in my account settings.
 In most cases I am able to sign in to the sites/services in question and in doing so I can identify contact info, update details and occasionally cancel and/or even purchase additional things.
 I’m confused as to how and why this is occurring. My assumption is fake credit cards and the users aren’t bothered by the receipt of the emails… but then you wouldn’t use genuine information such as home addresses and phone numbers…

 Been working in IT for 8 years as of this July. Just wondering if anyone else uses their expertise and knowledge for a side hustle? I work full time so it would only be in my spare time. So, how has that gone for people doing it? I&#x27;m just after some spare cash. I&#x27;m not looking to set up a proper business or grow it or anything. 
 The only thing that puts me off is I don&#x27;t live near a big city its mostly rural towns where I live but I was thinking of setting up a consumer IT support service in my local area for home users.

 Shot in the dark here, does anyone know of any automated way I can DBAN my workstations then install Windows over the top?
 I&#x27;ve got 100&#x27;s of PC&#x27;s to wipe and I&#x27;d like to not have to manually run DBAN on each and then MDT them all after, if its possible to do both in 1 shot.
 Cheers!

 Let&#x27;s say I were using OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) to record a video on my laptop. How could I have that video directly streamed to my Google Drive account?
 Here&#x27;s my use case: let&#x27;s say I had been using OBS to record a video for 27 minutes. If, something were to go awry on my end, let&#x27;s say, I inadvertently quit out of OBS or OBS were to crash, I still want those 27 minutes to be stored on my Google Drive account.

 I&#x27;ve spent some time today trying to ascertain if the Microsoft Store applications are actually safe/verified. I&#x27;m aware there is an application checking process but the description doesn&#x27;t give me full confidence. I&#x27;m having trouble finding if only Mozilla can add Firefox, only Fortinet can add Forticlient (etc), and that those publishers are verified so we don&#x27;t end up deploying a fake application to anyone.
 Does anyone do this? Are the MS Store apps available via Intune considered safe to deploy?

 When users login can they login with either domain on a computer? Will it create a new profile in Windows or does it recognize it as the same user? Any other things I should watch for?

 When we make a series of meetings that spans over 6 months and &#x27;invite&#x27; a meetingroom the room will reject all meetings if theres 1 single conflict.
 Meetings are done through Outlook calendar. Would it be possible to get some sort of notification that ex. 5 out of 6 meetings are accepted but 1 meeting has an conflict?
 Some values of current calendarprocessing:
 &gt; &gt; &gt; Get-CalendarProcessing &quot;Meetingroom A&quot; | select ConflictPercentageAllowed,allowconflicts,MaximumConflictInstances: &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ConflictPercentageAllowed AllowConflicts MaximumConflictInstances &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------- -------------- ------------------------ &gt; &gt; &gt; 0 False 5

                              <span>myself moved from helpdesk to sysadmin role within the company for 1.5 years. I would say, i can take care a lot of the daily operation tasks as sysadmin. but deeper like troubleshooting why suddenly all DHCP clients&#x27; lease time is 1 hours, instead 3 days or 7 days in a DHCP failover servers. We have like 2 guys in manger position with at lease 20 years of experience know lot more that me. 
 Each time we have issue in that level, i asked got blame for not doing much from the top level manger. Got asked, something like, how many servers you take care, how much do you know each severs.

                              <span>How do I ask for a raise after changing role/job responsibilities? 
 I am being moved to another team which no longer matches what my current responsibilities are and I want to avoid and set a precedent for myself being buried with work and being underpaid. What are things I can ask for and bring up. Is this even a valid case for a raise, as the role is much more demanding than what I was previously doing.

                              <span>Hi everyone, I&#x27;ve been in the IT side of things for a couple of decades but surprisingly somehow never grasped Kerberos all that well and combing through different literature never gave me what I wanted to know in one place regarding what actually happens in Active Directory networks. As part of the (re)learning process I ended up creating a diagram that I feel breaks it down a bit more thoroughly end-to-end.
 https://digitalredshirts.com/diagrams/kerberos/
 The fonts used in the original Visio didn&#x27;t make it into the export so some text alignment may be off depending on browser (rendering may be better in Chrome).
 This workflow is probably not 100% accurate and I could use feedback on any corrections or glaring ommissions. I&#x27;ve had to consult a number of books, online blogs, YouTube videos, my own lab packet captures, etc. to figure this out. It&#x27;s a bit of a visual mess due to the number of moving parts involved but maybe this may be useful to some people and/or they can provide suggestions for improvements. Making these diagrams is sort of a side hobby for me.

                              <span>I found another post about this happening almost a year ago here on reddit, but I&#x27;m not seeing one from today. C-Level email was hacked about 4 hours ago. I locked the O365 account to boot the hacker. I still see emails going out through barracuda, I&#x27;m not sure if the email going out now are coming from a cue or if somehow emails are still being sent.
 I&#x27;ve logged into AZURE and I can see the malicious login. It says there was a login attempt with DEVMAIL the first one says interrupted, then the next one says success.
 User did not get a 2FA text. He hasn&#x27;t used his computer today which I would think would rule out an infection on his machine. His current active device would be his iphone.
 Anyone else get and Office 365 (2FA protected) account hacked today? Any direction would be appreciated. Thanks all.

                              <span>So have this issue also when upgrading win10 to win11 22h2 where after the upgrade Office 365 32bit and Adobe acrobat XI or 2017 will not open. Now we have an issue in out test group with the June patches where some office 365 and/or Adobe products will not open this is on windows 10 machines. Most are running 32bit office 365 that broke but had some 64bit office also break after patching. Seems to happen on about 7-8% of our test group. Heard from a couple other IT groups that the June patches they are experiencing office and adobe product breaks. Anybody seen this?

                              <span>Hey y&#x27;all,
 I recently had a conversation with my 14-year-old nephew, and he expressed a strong interest in pursuing a career in IT/Information Security. As someone who works in IT myself but doesn&#x27;t honestly know all that much (especially career/education advice), I thought it might be advantageous to seek advice from this wonderful community on how to guide him in the right direction. He currently holds the CompTIA Security+ (which he took in April), and I advised him to go for CCNA or another Cisco cert next. What other bits of advice should I pass along to him when I see him next?

I&#x27;m used to working with an IT director that work along side other department heads. Just was wondering if anyone else has a similar arrangement?
 Edit: To add, did the department manage operations, like how they wanted the department to be run?

                              <span>They are letting go their lone IT guy, who is leaving very hostile and has all passwords in his head with no documentation or handoff. He has indicated that he may give domain password but that is it, no further communications. How do you proceed? There is literally hundreds of bits of information that will be lost just off the top of my head, let alone all of the security concerns.
 ​
  
Immediate steps? 
 Change all passwords everywhere, on everything right down to the toaster - including all end users, since no idea whose passwords he may know 
 have to hunt down all online services and portals, as well
 
 manually review all firewall rules
  Review all users in AD to see if any stand out- also audit against current employee list
 
 What to do for learning the environment? 
 Do the old eye test - physically walk and crawl around
 any good discovery or scanning tools?
 
 Things to do or think about moving forward 
 implement a password manager and official documentation
 love the idea of engaging a 3rd party for security audit of some kind to catch issues I may not be aware of
 review his email history to identify vendors, contracts, licenses, etc. 
 engage with all existing vendors to try to get a handle on things
 
 
 Far off things to think about 
 domain registration expiration
 certificates
 contracts

                              <span>Hi,
 We are finally moving away from McAfee Enterprise and are uninstalling it from our servers.
 For some reason not all of the services are being removed.
 McAfee Service Controller,
 McAfee Firewall Core Service and
 McAfee Validation Trust Protection Service are still there.
 I cannot get them removed. From the services console, I get an access denied. When I try it through the registry (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services) I get an access denied as well.
 It is not possible (as far as I have tried) to change the permissions on the services and program files or gain ownership. I tried running the commandline as SYSTEM (psexec -i -s cmd.exe), still access denied.
 I tried some consumer tools to remove it. From McAfee: MCPR.exe, did not work because it&#x27;s for consumer products only. I tried ESET AV remover, did not work.
 For now, the only thing that does work is to start the server in save mode and remove the registry keys manually. I truly hope that there is a better way to accomplish this and hope that someone knows that way and is willing to share it with me.
 Thanks! (a lot!)

                              <span>I recently inherited an intern and I&#x27;m not thrilled about it. I respect the fact that everyone has to start somewhere but teaching an intern is going to be a major work multiplier. It&#x27;s one thing to onboard a new employee that you know will be staying in the organization. Having an intern come 4 hours a day for 4 weeks is different. I often multitask and sometimes I just research problem resolutions. I feel like the sink or swim approach is what made me good in my field. I have for the most part taught myself everything that I know. I&#x27;m curious to know others thoughts on interns. We are a small organization &lt;60 employees, 2 servers, 4 network closets. It is not a complicated environment.

 List EOL dates for several products.
 maybe it helps someone if the maintainers of the website keep it up for long.
 PS: interesting there are flairs for discussions and rants, but not for resources.

                              <span>I have been in IT/Security for about 4 years now. 1 year at helpdesk, and 3 years in cyber security. My helpdesk role was more of a systems admin role than a helpdesk role. I was able to make the leap into security because I was manning the IDS/IPS and Defender alerts as helpdesk.
 I started a role at a new company about 1.5 years ago, and everyday I have the worst anxiety of my life before I clock in. Feels like I have 1,000 butterfly&#x27;s going crazy in my gut. I am paid an ungodly amount of money to do this job, and I feel like I am absolutely horrible at this.
 Whenever I report a vulnerability, the IT manager ALWAYS comes back at me saying that he doesnt believe the risk is there and that the system doesnt need to be patched. I was taught to go by zero trust, and understand that things like lateral movements exist. Pwning a UPS or some other IoT device can lead to lateral movement, especially when we have no XDR solution and rely only on EDR. I believe some of the issue can come from him being 40 years older than me. He says I go off buzz words too much. Its quite clear he does not like me, and honestly I am ok with that. It just makes my job harder when they dont want to patch internal systems because the risk is not there.
 This makes me feel like I dont know what I am doing. How do I get inside this guys head to understand what he wants? how do I evaluate risk from his perspective when I&#x27;ve had zero trust ingrained in my brain for years prior and certifications.

                              <span>Desperately need help debuging the following bug.... i just stend 2 weeks smashing my head on my desk not understanding what&#x27;s going on.
 So i have this application that need to connect to my server on port tcp/XXXX . Nothing special, just a TCP connexion, no TLS, No nothing. Just TCP push. On the server i have a service listening on this specific port. It IS listening we have verified.
 But When users are on-site the connection is dropped by the server ! 
 -Connection as ALLOWED by Firewall
 - Network capture mark the connexion cut by my server at the 4th packet of the TCP handshack 
 (client-&gt;server) SYN
 (server-&gt;client) SYN ACK
 (client-&gt;server)ACK 
 (server-&gt;client) ACK-FIN .
 -Activating WFP logs in windows even viewer on the server i saw that the connexion was Stealth-Drop by windows :
 Event ID : 5152
 The Windows Filtering Platform has blocked a packet.
 Application Information:
 Process ID: 0 Application Name: - 
 Network Information:
 Direction: Inbound Source Address: IP Source Port: sourceport Destination Address: IP Destination Port: Myport-listening Protocol: 6 
 Filter Information:
 Filter Origin: Stealth Filter Run-Time ID: netsh wfp show state tell me it&#x27;s &quot;Port Scanning Prevention Filter&quot; Layer Name: Transport Layer Run-Time ID: 13 
 ​
 Now , if this was all this could be easy. BUT NO. 
 Because it DOES work when the users are connected from their home (ipsec tunnel i think ?)
 but NOT when they are on-site, closer to the server.
 ​
 The port is open, we checked 4 times on our firewalls. The paquets are not modified by the networking equipement. No they really are dropped by windows to &quot;prevent port Scanning&quot; but it shouldn&#x27;t be considered port scanning when the service is listening ???? And why would it WORK or not work depending on client user IP ?
 We even checked with windows defender, firewall and local antivirus disabled but it still behave the same...
 Any idea or i am going mad ? 
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>I have a delicate situation with an employee who is also a global admin on our Office 365 account. Because of the situation I created an alert for anytime mailbox permissions were changed. The alert has been triggering a lot but it&#x27;s not very useful. I can&#x27;t tell who was given access to which mailbox. Is there any audit trail I can look at? TIA!

 I didn&#x27;t know if anyone else had this issue or if I&#x27;m just being dumb. I would love some suggestions as well. Here are a few that I can&#x27;t get the points for:
 Ensure that mobile devices require complex passwords (Type &#x3D; Alphanumeric)
 Ensure that mobile device password reuse is prohibited
 Ensure that mobile devices require complex passwords (Simple Passwords &#x3D; Blocked)
 Ensure mobile devices require the use of a password

                              <span>So I&#x27;m trudging through our catalog of older tech that we no longer need or use. We have a ton of it like keyboards, mice, older monitors and even a few older KVM switches. How do you go about contacting local orgs like schools and what not to see if we can&#x27;t donate? We were thinking of doing an employee giveaway but we have so much stuff that we can&#x27;t possibly give it all away to them.

                              <span>Just started doing some work for a customer who has a Windows Storage Server 2016 machine purchased from Dell.
 They would like to upgrade. They purchased Server 2019, licenses and cals (several years ago and its been sitting around collecting dust which is why they brought me on board as a consultant to do the upgrade, previous employee who managed their machines retired to florida during covid lockdowns), but it appears it is not possible to upgrade from Storage Server 2016 to 2019. Only a fresh installation is available on the setup screen.
 This makes sense I guess, since it would be like upgrading DataCenter 2016 to Standard 2019.
 However, the machine is not using any special features of Storage Server. Its just the version that came with the machine because I guess it had a MD1200 array attached to it.
 A fresh install really isn&#x27;t an option either since there are a few other pieces of software on here (a SQL Server 2019 instance and some CRM software supplied by a 3rd party vendor which runs through IIS and uses the SQL database to store data).
 I am guessing when they got the CRM software w/ SQL 2019, they got the Windows Server 2019 disk to upgrade and ran into this problem so &quot;if it ain&#x27;t broke don&#x27;t fix it&quot;. Bringing the CRM vendor on-site to do a re-install would be expensive and they&#x27;d like to avoid it. This customer does not have internet access for their network so remote vpn isn&#x27;t an option there. Someone has to fly in.
 So, is there any way to get server 2019 installed on this box w/o a format, e.g.
 a) can I somehow change the product key on the existing Windows Storage Server 2016 install to a Windows Server Standard 2016 product key and then do the &quot;upgrade&quot; (I did try this but it says my windows server 2016 product key is invalid, which I know it isn&#x27;t, since its in use on a real 2016 server at the moment (e.g. &quot;downgrade&quot; the server), or
 b) can I somehow &#x27;trick&#x27; the installation process to ignore the version?

                              <span>Hello, 
 I’ve found the ability in GPO to list the ciphers that we want used in the environment. However this seems it would exclude the use of newer ciphers unless the list is updated. I don’t want that. 
 I simply want to remove the ability to use deprecated ciphers across hundreds of servers. As I understand it these are usually turned off and added via windows updates, but that’s the catch isn’t it. 
 Is there a better way to limit old ciphers but allow new ones to be added? The GPO seems like it’s not the solution.

                              <span>We have very few servers in our environment, and one of them is a DC.
 I would like an external support dept to monitor and patch our servers (they offer 24/7), but I have a dilemma.
 I have to give them domain admin accounts so they can patch the DC - how do i know, they only focus on patching/updating and don&#x27;t access our AD or other stuff? Is that auditable, or is it possible to put alarms or restrictions in place?
 Perhaps you have an even better recommendation?

                              <span>Hi Wizards,
 I&#x27;m Junior guy taking care of some of our systems in our company as well as user support, lately I&#x27;m noticing more and more users are asking me about theirs mailbox sizes are getting full (like 90gb of 100gb), and I&#x27;m not really sure what to do about it ?
 For now I&#x27;m sending them to this guide https://support.microsoft.com/en-gb/office/manage-my-mailbox-size-792b521c-3f4e-404e-b436-9c197bad6f45 as I don&#x27;t find better solution than basically archive old mails which they don&#x27;t access frequently, but to be honest I don&#x27;t know how that works completely as well. 
 Sorry if this is basic trash question above everyone and I&#x27;m wasting your time.
 That fat IT guy.

 I really dislike the new settings panel and would prefer to have print management be used.
 Anyone have any ideas why this would be?

                              <span>For decades, I have used Windows Task Scheduler to run small processing jobs nightly. Currently, these are Server 2019 systems in question. Sometime in the last month, some of the jobs which rely heavily on the &quot;run as user&quot; context to gain access to specific resources started failing. When taking a closer look at these failing jobs, it appears that they are no longer &quot;running as&quot; the user which they are assigned. They are failing in different ways, too -- for instance, one job uses SQL Server Integrated security to login and retrieve data from a SQL Server, others move files around to different servers and need to have specific access to access these shares. It&#x27;s all failing now.
 These aren&#x27;t new jobs, they&#x27;re ones which have been running successfully daily for years. I&#x27;ve done all the obvious things like tried to re-create the jobs with no avail. The jobs run fine if I run them manually under the context of the users they&#x27;re expected to run as, like starting powershell as the user, or logging into the system as the user. They just no longer run through Task Scheduler.
 My environment IS a subset of a larger Active Directory with AD Admins for the environment that do have management abilities like applying group policies and the such. When asking these admins if they&#x27;ve applied any security settings over the last month, I&#x27;ve been met with a lot of shrugs and &quot;I don&#x27;t think anything has changed&quot;. Of course, I can see the applied policies but have no idea which, if any, have been added or modified in the last 30 days or so.
 So, I&#x27;m reaching out here and asking if perhaps any of you folks might have an inkling on what could be going on, or if there might be a GPO setting you can think of that could have been turned on or modified that my effect the Task Scheduler in this way. I would be open to any thoughts to suggestions, as I feel like the ability to run a job as another user is a key feature in Task Scheduler and without it, it&#x27;s relatively useless.

                              <span>Hello all.
 I have the unfortunate task of trying to get a water damaged iPhone SE gen2 back up and running. Now the user has tried turning it on after letting it &quot;dry&quot; (not sure how long they left it) and my theory is that it wasn&#x27;t completely dry and it&#x27;s shorted something on the board. My question is does anyone know of places in the UK where they do full repairs of water damaged phones, I see places online but I am unsure of what they&#x27;re like. I don&#x27;t think my local repair shop will deal with water damaged phones but if anyone has dealt with this kind of thing before your insights would be useful! 
 Any help appreciated!

 I can access to the site on standard port 443 through https://0.0.0.0/ but https://0.0.0.0:10210/.
 I checked the log and it shows as below after timeout.
 60203 10.0.10.201 NONE_NONE/503 0 CONNECT 0.0.0.0:10210
 My conf is as below.
 acl SSL_ports port 443 10210
 http_access deny CONNECT !SSL_ports
 ## When I just specify SSL_ports to only 443, I see logging
 ## 0 10.0.10.201 TCP_DENIED/403 2014 CONNECT 0.0.0.0:10210
 Can someone please help me to resolve the issue?
 Thanks

                              <span>As an IT responsible for maintaining and repairing various devices and travelling arround, i am using BUFFALO NAS LS-WXL/R1 with Web Access, I have noticed that the firmware on the device is 1.75 (pretty old in my opinion). My concern is regarding the security implications of using outdated firmware. Is it still safe to continue using this NAS with the outdated firmware? Because it seems it&#x27;s not updated anymore.

                              <span>hey
 for the longest time we used the office365 app to view office documents in our android workspaces as it didn&#x27;t neet a microsoft account - for some time, an account is required, though
 since then i&#x27;m looking for alternatives but have reached a point where i say that i can&#x27;t solve it on my own
 do you have recommendtions for a gdrpr compliant office viewer app that is ideally open source or free?
 i&#x27;ve used google docs etc in the past, but the app requires an account, too, as it seems.
 editing office documents would be a plus, but i&#x27;m primarily looking for a viewer
 thank you for every advice

 ​
 &quot;Its historical grown!&quot; - no its not. Its poorly documentend, planned and used for anything but the orginal intend
 &quot;We always did it this way&quot; + &quot;Why doesnt it work better?&quot; - because you always did it that way and if you finally migrate systems, you know the thing you actually employed me for we could actually be efficient
 &quot;Are we really needing that?&quot; - Im perfectly content with putting a typewriter up your desk instead if you want to
 &quot;Why is it so expensive?&quot; - because the last 5 years you invested 0 cents into any system now resulted in all systems beeing a dumpster fire instead of one at a time
 &quot;Could i get that fancy new Laptop for xyz person&quot; - Sure, but you know its not gonna work with the things you need to work because the system is so old that that new shiney System will cause it to have a stroke
 &quot;Why is my video quality sooo bad?&quot; - because i didnt get your approval to upgrade the system, funny how that turned out,right?
 &quot;So how quick can you learn to adminstrate at perfect level that 15 year old system your prior Admin supported and that is gone for 6 months and did it for the last 15 years?&quot; - How about ... never?

                              <span>So, heres a small story i experienced just 3 hours ago:
 Internet went down site-wide, checked everything from firewall to clients - everything working as intended. Router (in Bridge mode, Huawei Router issued by ISP) showing connected, but not passing through traffic.
 Calling them resulted from &quot;We don&#x27;t know what happened&quot; to &quot;We don&#x27;t care if you are a business customer&quot;. No word on how this will be fixed or when.
 Restored internet connectivity by integrating a fallback connection with same router but another provider (thankfully had everything physically set up, but planned configuring in a few days), but i am still so incredibly angry at all this. I pay them. They should respond according to SLA. At least i know it is an &quot;issue&quot; with them, not me - only thing they admitted after 7 calls. 
 What are your dumb vendor/ISP/contractor stories and how did you resolve it?

                              <span>Hi,
 I have been working at my current company for 2 years. Same time as one of my colleagues. This particular colleague is a “senior”. 
 Anyway this particular colleague is asking me for help with their tasks multiple times a day. I have tried my best to help them where I can without giving them direct instructions or answers, for example providing documentation or asking them questions to guide them to the answers in the hope that they will learn better that way. 
 However just lately I have felt drained by this, they continue to push and push till I’m basically at a point where I have to give them the answer else i won’t get any of my own work done.
 This week for example, they have taken a simple task in AWS which would take about 2/3 hour if you want to automate it with terraform (I don’t want to give too many specifics in case they are lurking). This job has now been going on for over a week still not completed it with almost daily questions about very basic things or asking to fix errors they are getting. To be clear this person has been working with terraform for almost 2 years at this point and was employed as a senior cloud engineer so it’s not like this person has just been dropped into something they shouldn’t or don’t understand.
 How is the best way of approaching this situation, I would like to get my time back and stop supporting this colleague so much. However, at the same time I don’t want to be considered unreasonable by refusing to help?
 Maybe I made this situation worse by helping in the first place I don’t know. I would appreciate other peoples thoughts on the matter and how to progress this situation.

                              <span>Hi!
 I have some issues with users coming from Windows 2012 R2, that they do not find the &quot;logoff/sign-out&quot; option.
 ​
 On Windows 2012, there is directly a &quot;logoff&quot;-button as standard for users.
 ​
 Do you have any idea on how to bring this back?
 ​
 Idea 1: Change default setting of &quot;on/off-button&quot; in start-menu to &quot;sign-out&quot;
 I tried this GPO, but without success: https://admx.help/?Category&#x3D;Windows_10_2016&amp;Policy&#x3D;Microsoft.Policies.StartMenu::PowerButtonAction
 ​
 Thank you for your thoughts

                              <span>Part of this cyber security initiative we&#x27;re undertaking involves removing unneeded privileges from users. Our helpdesk members had been given Global admin rights, which allowed them to reset user MFA when necessary.
 Now that they&#x27;ve lost the Global admin role, they don&#x27;t have this ability anymore.
 How is this done in other organizations? I feel like resetting MFA is something helpdesk should do, but I don&#x27;t think helpdesk should be M365 Global admins.

                              <span>Oh the things I love about working in IT. Two firewalls with hardware failure in less than a week&#x27;s time. One of those which the replacement arrive failed from the manufacturer. A sales rep that pushes to reschedule a meeting I had to move to work on the failed firewalls ASAP when I tell them I can&#x27;t promise timelines because I&#x27;m at the mercy of UPS so everything is tentative right now. Another sales rep that get&#x27;s upset because I hadn&#x27;t responded to an email he sent me saturday morning. I do sound a lighting as a side gig and had a show that loaded in at 10:30 am Saturday and I finally got home and in bed at 3 am Sunday. Woke up Sunday morning to monitoring alerts about the second failed firewall. Granted he didn&#x27;t know of that when he called today, but I also shouldn&#x27;t have had to explain to him multiple times I&#x27;d address that stuff once I finished working our firewall failures. So yea, I really love working in IT, the people and vendors make this profession so much fun.

                              <span>Why is MTU mismatch a problem in OSPF, I know we want matching MTU so that we can limit the size of LSU packets to an appropriate value to match the interfaces MTU but I’m thinking since LSUs are just IP packets cant the receiving router with lower MTU just fragment the packet if it receives a bigger LSU packet than it’s MTU?

                              <span>I&#x27;m at around 5 years of networking (7.5 years in IT) and my resume is like 1.2 pages long. This includes certifications, skills and technologies I work with, and education. It looks kind of busy and outdated though because it&#x27;s meant to be read properly by automated tracking systems. I have a fancy version that I think is much more aesthetically pleasing, but the text conversions on application sites aren&#x27;t super clean. I&#x27;m being told that I should be able to make mine one page long and very simple and short.
 I looked through this subreddit and some guy with 20+ years commented that his resume is 1 page long, and I also learned that Elon Musk&#x27;s resume is 1 page long. How does a network guy that needs to showcase experience with different protocols/projects even do that?
 My struggles come with trying to showcase a &quot;strong&quot; bullet that shows what you did, how you did it, what the impact was, and what the numbers are (people, costs, percentages, etc.) without making it more than 2 lines long.
 I&#x27;m also not sure if I should list prior IT helpdesk experience at other jobs to showcase my growth to try and make it shorter. Any advice would be appreciated.

                              <span>Hello all, the company I am working at is attempting to redo our configuration for the front of our network. Currently we just have two ISPs that get routed into our firewall and the firewall itself does the load balancing and fail over. We are looking to move towards BGP and get a more seamless solution going. But I wanted to know is it worth doing high-availability on the BGP portion of the routing? Could this be done with MLAG on the isp and our new layer 3 switches? We currently have two Palo Alto‘s for redundancy at the head of our network. I was thinking of setting something up like the image attached below, but wanted to know how it really would work with having two different ASN‘scans what ones would be hosting the actual /24’s themselves. Thank you all so much in advance!

                              <span>I have a family restaraunt I do network work for, and they&#x27;re are switching POS systems. And they want a really redundant system. Would it be a good idea to have a sub router under the main router just in case the main one goes down? Or just get 1 very good router and run everything off of that? 
 The POS is able to process orders locally without internet, but if I had a single router setup, it wouldn&#x27;t be able to do that if it went down. 
 Or should I look at it as more failure points for 2 routers?

                              <span>So like the title says, I am going to be in charge of building out some new infrastructure and it will need to be all 10GB.
 I have been having a surprisingly hard time finding good options for switches, they are either too small/consumer/Chinese or cisco + license requirements.
 Is there any middle ground? If not what are some good options? Ideally would like to keep it under $10k but if there is a good reason to spend more I am open to hearing it.
 We will need ~200 10GB rj45 ports eventually but starting off with a single 48 port should be good enough with at least a 40gb uplink, 100gb would be better.
 ​
 EDIT: More details.
 They will be connecting directly to servers via cat6/7 10gb connections. The actual networking setup will be really basic/simple.
 router &gt; 10gb switches via trunk lines &gt; servers
 The servers will only need to access the internet. In fact they will be fire walled and port isolated to ensure that is all they have access to on this network. Vlans will also be used.
 Thanks for any suggestions! Little out of my depth, first time swimming in this end of the pool.

                              <span>Hello all.
 I&#x27;m a network engineer looking to get my hands dirty in the cloud space, as it pertains to networking solely (if that&#x27;s even a thing).
 I know absolutely nothing about cloud engineering so I was curious what some of you may recommend would be a good starting point to start learning. Do I go AWS, Azure, some other vendor? I learn best via videos so if there are any good beginner courses someone can recommend, i&#x27;d appreciate it.
 Thank you.

                              <span>I have a few sites connected via MPLS, with our address scheme being 10.1.0.0/26 for Site A, 10.2.0.0/16 for Site B and 10.3.0.0/16 for Site C. We use OSPF for our routing protocol.
 Recently I have noticed when I do a &quot;sh ip route&quot; on my core switches at any of the sites, there is some odd routes that appear there and I am wondering if anyone knows why these would be learned?
 Should I contact my ISP and inquire with them?
 Here is some excerpts of the weird routes in the routing table from Site A&#x27;s perspective:
 1.0.0.0/32 is subnetted, 2 subnets
 O E2 1.2.3.4 [110/1] via 10.1.254.1, 2w3d, Vlan254
 O E2 1.2.3.5 [110/1] via 10.1.254.1, 2w3d, Vlan254
 20.0.0.0/24 is subnetted, 1 subnets
 O E2 20.20.20.0 [110/1] via 10.1.254.1, 2w3d, Vlan254
 172.25.0.0/22 is subnetted, 2 subnets
 O E2 172.25.8.0 [110/1] via 10.1.254.1, 2w3d, Vlan254

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got a 2540 as a core switch. It does L3 vlan routing.
 It&#x27;s connected to another 2540, and a bunch of 2530s.
 On the logs of the 2540 core, I&#x27;m seeing loads of 
  IPv4: Duplicate IPv4 address 192.168.2.254 is detected on port 1 in VLAN 30 with a MAC address of 104f58-e81420 (18 times in 60 seconds) 
 That mac address is the mac address of the core 2540, the 2.254 IP is part of a /30 subnet that connects to a firewall. (Port 10)
 The core 2540 is connected on port 1 to the other 2540. The other 2540 is just acting as a switch, routing is off. It has an IP on the management subnet.
 All switches have GVRP enabled. If I turn off GVRP on the non-core 2540, it fixes the problem. Why might this be? STP is off, there are no loops.
 What I typically see if pinging anything connected to the other 2540, is everything is fine for a while, 2-5 minutes, then pings drop for 5 seconds, and repeat.
 All the VLANS on the other 2540 are all statically configured, apart from two (vlan 100,200) which aren&#x27;t actually used for anything at all. They&#x27;re just configured VLANs.
 I must be not understanding how GVRP works, so any advice is welcome
 thanks

Not sure if it&#x27;s only Ubiquiti behind on upgrading all their hardware to the 48v standard or if other vendors mix their product lines as well.
 Setting up some Ubiquiti equipment and I wish they would settle on a single PoE voltage...
 I need 3 switches:
  
LAN + 1x 48v + 2x 24v
 LAN + 1x 24v + 1x 48v (Two of them)
  
I got their USW-Flex-Utility with the switch, but it&#x27;s 48v only. These setups are going outdoors and the only thing I found are a variation of this one, with a single LAN and 24v/48v out. Max wattage used would be around 30w.
 Tks in advance.

                              <span>After replacing Cisco ASA&#x27;s with Fortigate&#x27;s I&#x27;m reluctant to change anything in the AD environment, since this worked just fine before on the ASAs.
 I can ping and resolve DNS hostnames to these SMB file shares on VPN, only thing that doesn&#x27;t work is SMB access. Fortigate logs show correct policy being applied and traffic being approved.
 No success with run commands to full UNC path or IP address. I&#x27;ve tried mapping directly through explorer and prompting for login to try other domain accounts with no success.
 Min version of SMB on Fortigate is set to v1 and max ver is set to v3.
 I&#x27;ve allocated DNS servers for VPN clients to use same as domain.

                              <span>I am looking to buy this DIN rail mounted switch, https://www.fs.com/products/138511.html
 It does not ship with a power supply, I&#x27;ve confirmed with my rep. They don&#x27;t sell power supplies, also confirmed by my rep.
 The input voltage is 48-57VDC. Nothing is built out yet, but I plan on having this switch and power supply (along with fiber and copper) installed outside in a weatherproof enclosure. The copper/fiber will be ran separate from power, but I&#x27;m also having a 120v power outlet installed in this box. A DIN rail switch isn&#x27;t needed, but it would make the install cleaner. In a proper cabinet with all DIN rail mounted equipment there would also be an existing power source, but this is an isolated install.
 I think I can buy this and cut off the connector and wire the leads right into the green power plug on the switch.

 I&#x27;m starting in this sub making an assumption that there are network guys that have dealt with these types of installs.

                              <span>Hello,
 ​
 I am facing the issue when devices do not accept DHCP offers in this scenario:
  
Client connects to wifi network. IP is assigned via DHCP. Lease time 30min
 User puts PC to sleep, walks to another floor.
 After some time (probbably when lease time is over) user wakes up PC from sleep
 PC sends DHCP discover requesting its previous IP
 DHCP server sends DHCP offer with different IP.
 PC discards offer provided from server with event viewer log message: Offer is discarded on the interface 42. Error code is 0x0
 PC sends another discover requesting the old IP.
  
...
 ​
 5,6,7 repeats all the time.
 This is not a single PC issue.
 ​
 I did a packet capture on PC and there are no DHCP reject packets or something more. Only discovers and offers.
 ​
 Does anyone have an idea where to look at?
 ​
 ​
 ​
 Edit:
 Windows10 PC
 Fortigate acting as DHCP server

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 My company uses EIGRP for its core network routing and wants me to change it to OSPF.
 See below a diagram of our core network :
 https://prnt.sc/aZdl9T\_ae3qq
 We have 3 offices (BLUE / ORANGE / GREEN) which are interconnected and connected to the same ISP (RED).
 The core network of every office consists of one router and one MLS. We use 3 different EIGRP AS so that the router of each office gets its default route by the ISP and redistributes it in the other EIGRP AS with a higher cost to have redundancy if the link between one office and the ISP is down.
 I wanted to take advantage of this change to simplify my architecture by using one signle OSPF area. But I don&#x27;t know the best way to configure it. And that&#x27;s mainly because all the routers &amp; MLS are in the same VLAN meaning the OSPF cost from any core device to another is the same.
 Using multiple OSPF areas would probably work but I was wondering if you had better ideas.
 I&#x27;ve heard of the &quot;per-neighbor cost&quot; feature in OSPF but it isn&#x27;t 100% clear to me if it&#x27;s made for this kind of situations. Unfortunately I couldn&#x27;t try in because it isn&#x27;t supported in my &quot;simulation&quot; software.
 Thanks :)

 I have 2 new HPE ProLiant DL380 Gen10 servers. Both of these servers came with Broadcom BCM57414 network cards.
 Can any recommend a compatible third-party SFP 1Gb modules for these servers? HPE SFP modules are somewhat expensive.
 Note: these SFP 1Gb modules will connect to my Cisco 24-port 1GB unmanaged switch. I did recently purchase an HPE Aruba 6300M managed switch, but it hasn&#x27;t come in yet.

                              <span>So I have a Draytek Vigor 2866 device in my office that I want to connect to over the internet (using a 5G router from Three Network in the UK) and have setup two different types of VPN - SSL &amp; L2TP/IPSec.
 L2TP/IPSec works mostly without any issues but rarely have issues trying to connect as it gets stuck trying to dial into that VPN. I know it is old tech and would be more secure and stable to use SSL.
 SSL connects okay but gives me issues when I try to load anything, from a webpage to RDP connections are incredibly slow (does not even load most of the time). I&#x27;m not sure if it is an MTU issue but I&#x27;ve tried to set the MTU as low as 1000 and it still didn&#x27;t fix it for me.
 Earlier in the year when I switched to this ISP&#x27;s 5G internet connection, I had incompatibility issues with IPSec/ESP VPN connections for my wife so we got her to change to SSL VPN which worked just fine for her. I have a few other SSL VPN connections from the same laptop that work fine through this network so I&#x27;m not sure where to start with the debugging on this one. Appreciate any advice.
 P.S: I&#x27;m using Smart VPN Client from Draytek on my laptop to connect to the router.

                              <span>Hello, I try to configure a new aruba 6100 switch. (Lets call it Switch A)
 I configured an IP on the Vlan 1 and connected the switch A to another switch (Switch B) that outputs that Vlan 1 untagged. When I do so, every device connected to switch b cant communicate at all, get an apipa and so on. 
 Needless to say, I can&#x27;t reach the new Switch A via IP either. (Unless I connect the Lan directly to the switch and configure the gateway address to the switch managment IP)
 When I disconnect Switch A from Switch B, everything is fine again.
 Configuration Switch A:
 Current configuration:
 !

 Does anyone have any ideas what I am doing wrong?

I&#x27;m scared I won&#x27;t be able to handle the physical constraints of being a network Technician as I don&#x27;t fully know all the duties a Network technician goes through. should I look into other careers with less typing?

                              <span>After migrating the Enterprise CA to a new datacenter, I cannot reissue the certificates. The only certificates showing are from the list of default built-in certificates. I do see all the certificate templates when I go to the Manage view to see all certificates, but I just don’t see them listed as an option to issue.
 The CA has connectivity with the domain controllers at the new site. Is there any reason it also needs connectivity with the DCs at the old site or would this be a different issue?

 Are there specific requirements for running ethernet outside a wall or ceiling? I&#x27;m running ethernet under tables that are perpendicular to the wall.
 FWIW, there&#x27;s no POE: they&#x27;re just going from an access switch to desktop clients.

After it is restarted the password can only be changed once then it will say it doesn’t meet the complexity requirements no matter how complex it is. Anyone know what’s happening? I have tried changing the password policies and confirmed it has changed but it’s still not working.

 This person is an expert at getting out of work by using excuses like these.
 Is there a proper term for this person, other than lazy POS?

                              <span>Had a run-in today with a coworker that was under stress and it went south. I was late on a deadline that required setting up network, some specific hardware as well as a UPS (this was not a priority of mine as I had already a lot on my plate) so I was ready for some pissed off user/coworker, which is understandable even though the situation was not critical and work could still be done.
 Well they were much more than pissed off. They made degrading remarks about my work (or according to them lack-there-of) and basically shoo-ed me like a 5 y.o. I standed there baffled for a minute then proceeded to tell them that this was no way to talk to a coworker and that I had actually some work to do that needed their input.

                              <span>Past several months we have seen, heard or experienced outages from major vendors. Yet, it&#x27;s not in the news or even publicly acknowledged. While most would point fingers at state actors but it could also be a BSOD, patch etc 
 Whatever the case, it&#x27;s becoming extremely critical to have a proper plan B and not rely on these massive clouds. Imagine if Microsoft goes down for a couple of days.. no emails no banking etc etc 
 What&#x27;s your plan B?

 So this facility recently fell in my lap because I was placed on leave without pay from my day job. I&#x27;m lucky that this will pay my bills. The place is a mess. I&#x27;m doing my best though. My first order of business was installing remote access software, uBlock Origin, and Virus scans.
 We have a NEC 5800 server onsite that is only running the DHCP role and Server 2012 R2. Upgrading the OS is on my list first. That being said, it has 16 GB of RAM and 2 TB of storage, but there is room to expand although this server is running out of time, imo. This site has literally nothing hosted on pre…</span>

 The account has a good password (reset recently) and MFA set correctly.
 We have Azure AD identity protection enabled too.
 Any way to stop this from happening? Other than changing the UPN?

 Is something like &quot;Sign in with Google&quot; enough of a representation or should there more? 
 I&#x27;m aware of the standard definition of SSO - but while $currentJob is still growing - I&#x27;m looking for more information on what I should look out for before reviewing sign ups to expensive enterprise plans.

                              <span>Hi all,
 About to ugprade our vcenter from 6.7 to 8.0u1b (latest release) but was wondering if it is compatible with our hosts running esxi 6.7 (to be upgraded to 8.0 after upgrading vcenter...)
 I checked the interoperability matrix chart on vmware site and they seem to be compatible but just want a sanity check before upgrading.
 ​
 Anyone ran vcenter 8 with their hosts still being on 6.7?
 Thanks.

                              <span>Hi,
 We&#x27;re configuring a new proxy server for BYOD traffic. Windows clients detect the proxy settings by using DHCP option 252 to get the WPAD file, but neither Android or IOS support this.
 Anyone know what the options are? Outbound traffic is blocked on ports 80 and 443, and when the proxy is entered manually on Android and IOS it all works correctly. We&#x27;re just missing the auto detection piece.
 Any advice gratefully received!

 Does anyone know if there is a registry key that I can set to force Outlook to use the default browser?

                              <span>Morning / Afternoon all,
 Anyone know why my Azure AD Joined devices can suddenly no longer print to our printers installed on a print server?
 We went through all this crap during the Print Nightmare fiasco, but in the last few weeks my users have been getting the generic error of: Windows cannot connect to the printer: Error 0x0000011b.
 Our domain joined devices have no issue.
 All users who are using an Azure AD joined device have AD / O365 synced accounts, so are using &#x27;SSO&#x27; with on prem resources. Never had issues before.
 The only fix I have found at the moment is creating the following key on the print server: Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\RpcAuthnLevelPrivacyEnabled and setting it to 0 - but I am almost certain that this then introduces the print nightmare vulnerability again.
 What gives? Anyone else had the same issues? None of the recently installed patches seem to be causing this, I&#x27;ve uninstalled them all from a users device and the print server...

                              <span>A couple months ago I figured out my company was doing some miscalculations when we sold our software. We service a non-technical industry, so for certain customers we will essentially set them up a VM in an isolated Vnet, install their apps, and let them connect in to use the software and do their order processing, accounting, or whatever. A &quot;We handle it all&quot; type of sales package.
 This week I dug in more and unfortunately, they were licensing these based on CAL model (per employee of our customer) even though there is also an external website component (Public facing store for order entry). This means you need core-based licensing as I understand it.
 Even though there&#x27;s only a few non-compliant systems, 24 cores at ~3K each is going to be a pretty big problem when I bring it up. And I don&#x27;t think the company plans to change their business model. Well this sucks.

                              <span>I singed up for a trial for P2 licensing. I then signed up to P1 as well just to see some differences. So far I haven&#x27;t seen any differences when both licenses are assigned to different users in our tenant. Does this mean that if I have a mix of P1 and P2 licenses, I will reap the benefits of the P2 license at least in the management portion (devices discover, inventory, etc)? Or am I missing something?

                              <span>We use Phoenix Druva to back-up our VM infrastructure. This application offers different restore scenarios: file/folder restore, full vm restore, restore using sandbox. See: https://docs.druva.com/Phoenix/030_Configure_Phoenix_for_Backup/010_Backup_and_Restore_VMware/040_Restore_Virtual_Machines/080_File_Level_Restore
 We want to do monthly restore testing, how would you organize the tests? Would you rather restore a single file, or restore the complete VM? Or restore in a sandbox scenario? In an ideal world, I would like to automate this as much as possible. Their API doesn&#x27;t seem to offer any restore capabilities. You can only restore to original location, but I don&#x27;t want to interrupt the live VM. See: https://developer.druva.com/reference/restoreoriginalrequest-1
 So I guess this will be a monthly manual action. Looking for your opinions how you would approach this.

 My 3rd party patch management solution refuses to patch it because it requires a license. Intune with chocolatey/winget doesn&#x27;t seem to work for me. Perhaps I am doing it wrong. How do you guys handle it?

                              <span>It&#x27;s very late, and I&#x27;ve hit a roadblock in my plans to decommission an old Domain Controller as I&#x27;ve found the old admin has installed an Enterprise Root CA on it as well... Essentially, I still need to update this machine to Server 2022, but I also need to keep the CA in place, at least for now.
 I think the easiest path forward is as follows, but wanted to seek advice incase I&#x27;m missing something obvious as I&#x27;ve never dealt with a CA before.
 Prep so far:I have moved FSMO roles to a new DC, I have also spun up an extra DC to replace this one and put them in place as new DNS servers.
 Planned steps:
  
Take a CA backup, including the root certificate, Private Key etc.
 Remove AD CS from old DC
 Demote old DC
 Remove the old server from the domain
 Install Windows Server 2022 fresh with the same name as the old server; join it to the domain. 6. Install AD CS using existing root certificate and CA settings. 7. Restore the CA backup on the new server.
  
Am I missing anything critical? Seems like the CA is only issuing some certs for Directory Services, LDAPS and some intranet sites, so I&#x27;m not sure how essential it is but that&#x27;s a problem for after I get rid of all the other 2012R2 VMs.
 Thanks in advance for any tips!

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 We have around 15 workstations and 2 printers on the second floor. We recently bought two (2) new workstations and noticed that neither of them were getting any signal from the ethernet/switch (computer said no ethernet cable connected). I troubleshooted it for a while and noticed that every time I disabled the ethernet adapter, the lights on the ethernet port starting to show some data. To me, this seem like a driver or Windows issue so I updated the drivers using the latest one from the MB&#x27;s website with no success. I also clean installed Windows and no success.
 One thing I did notice is that they would get internet if the connection was bridged. For example, our VoIP phones have a PC port. When bringing a cable from the VoIP port, the computer would get internet. I also tried with a 5 port switch and it actually worked too. It seems that the issue is when connected directly to the wall.
 When I noticed that everything worked when not plugged directly to the wall, I started to mess around the connection on the switch and no matter what I did the issue was always there. What seems strange to me is that no other workstation that are already there present similar issue. I even connected the computer to one port that was already working for someone else and the PC will not recognize the ethernet cable.
 I grab the computers and brought them to a different floor and they work fine when connected directly to the wall. This makes me think that it could be a switch related issue. This is the first time I come across something like this in my work experience. I have called a couple of friends who were also clueless on what could be the issue.
 Any advise will be greatly appreciated!!

I feel that much of the anger from our recent decision around the downstream sources comes from either those who do not want to pay for the time, effort and resources going into RHEL or those who want to repackage it for their own profit. This demand for RHEL code is disingenuous. 
  
I mean, fair enough. We &#x27;bought in&#x27; to the RHEL ecosystem, running Centos in prod, and now were moving to Alma. We had a few RHEL support contracts for &quot;key&quot; servers, but mostly stuck with the open source options, and found that having an easy &#x27;move-to-prod&#x27; road was of some value. 
 Shooting down Alma, Rocky, Oracle Linux and Centos all at once though? Well, I guess that&#x27;s a pretty solid &#x27;F you&#x27; and we&#x27;ll now have to review our options. I guess this might drive some license fees out of us, but it might as easily push us to &#x27;never RedHat&#x27;. Going to have to have some internal discussions about that.

                              <span>How does everyone force updates on users devices?
 We use IBM MaaS 360 for mobile devices and InTune for Windows/IOS devices, problem is we have what we believe to be forced updates turned on but during our Cybersecurity internal audits we are finding people are still not on the current OS&#x27;s?
 Could it be something within a policy that is allowing them to not update/not pushing out the updates? 
 We have changed the window for updating from 9 days to instant and have auto updates on for IOS but we&#x27;ve had to manually call users and walk them through updating.
 Any extra add-ons/management tools people use to ensure devices are updated as soon as possible?
 Thankyou for any suggestions/help!!

We use your timesheets to track the progress of the project. Then fucking don&#x27;t. Pay for purpose-built tools (that you use the free tier of) you cheap shits and track the project there.
 
You should keep your timesheets as correct as possible, we encourage sticking to 30 minute intervals or less. Wait untill you see 3 hours a week for &quot;time teacking&quot;, we&#x27;ll see how your tone will change.
 
We want to understand any painpoints you may have with time tracking. Really? How about allowing any kind of extension that would let me import my meetings? Oh, you have to pay for the premium tier of the software? Fuck me then.
 
These are our company policies and we do ask you to follow them. Yeah, well, not for long now. I have my resignation ready, just need to fill in a date.
 Bonus one: wait untill those dipshits hear that I know they broke the labour laws where I&#x27;m at. Oh, what a fun &quot;exit interview&quot; that&#x27;s going to be.
 
 And again, FUCK YOU. 
 For anyone that read my previous rant about this hellhole - yes, they are still very proud of the $20 they give us each month for pizza

 The workaround right now is to downgrade the client to version 2.2159.179.0.

                              <span>Hi, 
 ​
 I am having some issues at the minute where when users start outlook for the first time it is using the local domain instead of our email domain. For exmaple, harry.local instead of harry.co.uk
 ​
 I don&#x27;t think we can use autodiscover as I wouldn&#x27;t be able to setup the DNS entries. Is there any other way I can do this via a script or GPO? 
 ​
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hi Gurus, 
 My boss wanted me to implement OneDrive to all users and he&#x27;s asking me if the following is possible. 
 - Prevent File Deletion In the Folders(Desktop,Documents,Pictures) that are being backed up by OneDrive 
 - Prohibit Any Files Transfer from the Above mentioned 3 Folders to any other locations of the User&#x27;s PC which is not being backed Up by OneDrive 
 - For IT Admins to Receive notifications when User&#x27;s Storage Quota is going to be full. 
 For me it seems weird for the first two requirement... but yeah if anyone can enlighten me, will be excellent :) 
 PS: MS Support said that GPO is possible for the first two criteria and MS Flow for the last.

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve inherited a domain where I guess lots of different sysadmins have built their own servers over the years and now we have this crazy mishmash of naming conventions.
 Something simple like a Domain Controller I can just rebuild, but something like WSUS, MDT or our door system takes a lot more effort so I&#x27;m thinking... could I just get away with just renaming them on DNS? Or is that what you would consider to be &quot;bad practice&quot;?
 Or can Windows and Linux (Ubuntu) servers generally survive a rename these days without causing a ruckus on the network/domain?

                              <span>I look after the computers of a company that has 80 staff. The company has experienced a lot of growth and have effectively doubled in size in 2/3 years. They have high staff retention, and there are people there who have been there since the late 90&#x27;s/early 00&#x27;s. 
 IT today is different to what it was then, and a lot of the time the battles I face are with these more established members of staff who moan every single change we make to the IT. The most recent IT change was establishing Intune and a few changes in regards to desktop backgrounds and windows updates. A lot of them hit the roof when we set a default desktop background, demanding it be changed back on &quot;their computer&quot;. A polite reminder that the computer&#x27;s belong to the company and aren&#x27;t personal devices stopped that.

 I&#x27;m currently working on automating a task and I could really use your help with the task planner. Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m trying to achieve: I want to set up a trigger that activates whenever a file is received via SFTP on a server.
 Basically, I&#x27;m looking for a way to create a trigger or find a workaround that can detect when a file arrives via SFTP. This trigger will be used to initiate a specific action or process.
 Do any of you have experience with this or know of any tools or methods that could help me accomplish this? I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or insights you can provide.
 TL;DR: Need assistance with setting up a trigger for my task planner that activates when a file is received via SFTP on a server. Looking for suggestions or workarounds.
 Thank you in advance for your help!

 ​
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/performance/office-slow-or-stop-responding
 ​
 I can only Imagine that it&#x27;s Caching an offline version of the file temporarily until it can reconnect to their SP sites.
 Has anyone who&#x27;s tried this ever experienced any Syncing issues?
 Or if there&#x27;s anyone that could shed some light on how applying this registry change works and what it does, that would be amazing.
 It seemed to fix the issue for the one user I could run the workaround on, but I&#x27;m skeptical that it can be applied as a blanket fix for the whole site without causing issues with Sync, especially if multiple users are working on the document at once.

                              <span>can someone, ffs, please explain this difference? it seems like import will grab all objects and put them into the metaverse for export. sync does the same thing but compares these objects and performs this export process automatically?

 We already got network address 1.1.1.0/8 for some swiches.
 Will it be properly connected to the internet? Or will name resolution be performed within the LAN?

                              <span>I am in search for a muti-vendor networking monitoring and mapping solution. Based on reading LLDP, CDP, STP, ARP tables, and other useful information from SNMP, the goal would be that the platform would map out a multi-vendor network. Then based on the mapping and links, the monitoring rules would create device dependencies and alarm rollups automatically
 Example, if 24 PoE access points are connected to a poe switch, and the the switch becomes unreachable, I would only want to see 1 alarm showing because the switch is down all 24 APs are also down. I wouldn&#x27;t want to see 25 separate alarms.
 I know this is a function of many nms platforms, but which does it the best in a multi-vendor network? I know Meraki or even Ubiquiti does it well when it&#x27;s all one brand of equipment, but most networks are multi vendor environments that seem to break things horribly. Looking for suggestions other then draw visio diagrams and create the dependencies yourself scenarios!

                              <span>Hey all, I’ve come across a request where we are attempting to create a test shelf where a number of devices would be plugged in at the same time to be diagnosed and troubleshot/repaired. Once the machine is done it would be replaced with another machine and so on. The ask is that each slot on the shelf correlate to an ip address so that there is no confusing which machine is which. After doing some thinking and research the most plausible solution I could come up with was creating a different vlans for each network port with short lease times on a dhcp scope of 1 IP. Was looking here to see if anyone else has done something similar or if there is another way. 
 Thanks in advance

                              <span>Hello Reddit, 
 I am looking for some advice from individuals who definitely know more then me. 
 I work for a small business and I am trying to help improve the network for security purposes. Currently we run the Meraki Go system in our 4 locations. It leaves a lot to be desired. The other day the firewall in one location had a port failure and their app never showed us that was the issue. We discovered it when we switched the ethernet cable from one port to the other. I find that defeats the purpose. It should clearly have shown me this was happening, but still it does not tell me there is a port failure. In the end, I just feel this system is not developed enough and I want to move on. 
 I considered Barracuda, Palo Alto and Fortinet, but honestly, their price point, the business owner will not go for it. Not even close. 
 Then I discovered Firewalla, its a lot closer to what I want, especially with the VPN system and MSP they have, but their yearly subscription really makes a reasonably priced product and decently expensive product. 
 I thought I would pose this question to the /reddit world. Any alternative solutions I should look at, that may provide a solution that is better than meraki go, but more reasonable then firewalla. Or if Firewalla really is the real deal and I should sell my boss. Or, alternative solutions. 
 Thanks for your time guys. 
 Colin

                              <span>Hi everyone. I&#x27;m in a bit of a dead-end and was wondering if anyone here has any ideas. I know this is EOL hardware, but unfortunately that&#x27;s what we have...
 Here is my saga: I have a Cisco 3750X-24P-L which I want to stack with a 3750-48P-S
 The reason I need to stack these is, apart from port density, the fact that the 3750X has PoE+ and a 10G uplink.
 The challenges:
 The 3750-48P-S can only run IOS 12, since it only has 16mb of internal flash, and IOS15 doesn&#x27;t fit.
 The 3750X-24P-L is originally licensed with lanbase, which doesn&#x27;t allow it to stack with non-lanbase switches. If I upgrade it to IOS15, I&#x27;m able to activate the RTU license and have it boot ipservice or ipbase, which would allow me to stack, but you can&#x27;t stack IOS12 with IOS15.
 In IOS 12, I don&#x27;t seem to be able to activate a RTU license, even with a &quot;universal&quot; image.
 In IOS12 it seems you can activate a 90day trial license of ipservices, I&#x27;ve tried that, but it seems my 90 days were already used. (These switches are old, before I worked here, and someone might have activated the trial in the past).
 I have tried formating the flash to see if the trial resets, or even changing the date, but no luck.
 Considering these switches are EOL and EOS, is there any other alternative? The famous website where Cisco would allow you to generate keys seems to have been long gone.

 I know what a VLAN is and how to configure it on a switch. ie put ports into vlans etc.
 How does one associate and entire network range to a vlan ie lets say 172.17.18.xxx belong to vlan 1718? where does that get configure. I am new to networking and sorry for this silly question. Any help you are able to provide is greatly appreciated.
 ​
 Thank you

 When testing with flask, I try to ping any address. but I get the following error:
 router1 is an invalid location
 I have tested the username and password and they work.
 Here is my anonymized devices.yaml:
 routers:
 - name: router1
 address: 1.5.2.1
 network:
 name: PRODUCTION
 display_name: AS65004
 username: hyperglass
 password: correct
 port: 22
 nos: cisco_xr
 vrfs:
 - name: global
 default: true
 ipv4:
 source_address: 1.5.3.1
 ipv6:
 source_address: ::fffe::1
 Surprisingly when I change name to name: New York City, NY , I don&#x27;t get an invalid location but I get an authentication error(even though IP address and credentials are valid.

                              <span>I hope someone has some information on this, or can point me in the right direction 
 I have tons of multimode fiber strand between two rooms on different floors (100+) via a LC OM4 patchpanel
 I have a switch in each room I want to link up with 100GbE optics. My gut is: 1) take a qsfp28 2) put a MTP breakout on it 3)Plug it into the patch panels 4) reverse it on the other end.
 It seems too simple though, I know polarity can be a thing the trunk lines are setup such that port 1 goes to port 1, 2 to 2 ...etc
 But then would i get away with an 8 strand breakout? Or would I need a 12 strand breakout?
 I created a little.diagram, I&#x27;ve attached if it helps anyone visualize this.....

 The ability to run new cables (MTP or realistically SMF) is not really an availability at this time, especially when the cabling exists already and is under utilized.
 If any

 Forgot to mention switches

 Could you provide me with some comments? I&#x27;ve been working as a network engineer for five years, specializing in routing and switching. I also have some experience with SDWAN. I&#x27;m contemplating a transition into the security field, specifically focusing on Firewalls/NetSec. Do you believe it&#x27;s still a worthwhile endeavor to pursue? Am I potentially late to the game? Alternatively, should I redirect my attention towards other areas such as cloud or automation? Thank you in advance for your insights!

 {Azure VM}
  
   
  
 [HQ]&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;&#x3D;[BR1]
 BR1 is connected to HQ with its own Fibre connection and on top a IPSEC Connection to encrypt the Data.
 BR1 Clients are using RDP to connect to a Azure VM which is only reachable through HQ.
 ​
 We do have connection Issues with Clients tho. If we set Clients MTU to 1432 everything works. But ofc we do experience overall Performance Issues with that MTU.
 ​
 Why is that the case and how do I approach this the right way ?

                              <span>Hello fellow networkers,
 I am running two Cisco XRv9000 virtual machines in a VMware host environment. They were both instantiated from the same existing virtual machine template.
 The whole environment is multivendor and is running LLDP for neighbor discovery. Now when i look at LLDP neighbors on a machine connected to both XRv9000 VMs, i can see them overwriting each others entry, because they both have the same Chassis ID.
 Can the Chassis ID be changed on a XRv9000 virtual machines so i would avoid this behaviour with LLDP ?

 If I just connect the server to both I of course can&#x27;t control on which network from which interface I&#x27;ll reach a specific ip, so I need to translate the way my server sees one of the 10.0.0.0/24 networks to 10.0.1.0/24.
 What would be the best way to do it? I thought of putting a pfsense machine betweek the server and one network, set up 250 subinterfaces on it, then set those as 1:1 nats. That sounds a bit overkill and I&#x27;m sure there&#x27;s a better way out there to solve this &quot;simple&quot; case of &quot;i want this network part of the ip to become that, leave the host octet as it is&quot;
 Any help greatly appreciated!!
 Also the way we have it now is with an internal vswitch that has no uplinks, and another vm connected to it- we remote into it and then access the network in a regular way

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 We are currently facing a design issue with our Azure Expressroute setup, specifically with BGP between Microsoft (MS) and our Fortinet solution. Our setup involves two connections (two VLANs) from the firewall to Azure, and we have decided against using ECMP for various reasons. Therefore, we require an Active-Passive setup.
 For normal operation, we have successfully configured the Active-Passive setup using path prepending and local preference to determine the appropriate connection. When one of the peers goes down, failover occurs without any issues.
 However, we have encountered a problem during maintenance activities. If Azure initiates maintenance on the primary link, the BGP neighborship remains active, but traffic cannot flow through the connection. Before starting maintenance, MS pre-pends the primary connection. Unfortunately, since we rely on local preference, this pre-pending does not resolve the issue, as the local preference takes precedence over the prepending value.
 We have been attempting to collaborate with the Azure side (another IT supplier) to consistently pre-pend the secondary connection. This would allow us to eliminate the dependency on local preference. However, it seems that Azure does not support this configuration.
 Are there others who have experienced similar issues? We would greatly appreciate any insights or suggestions on how to resolve this challenge. Unfortunately, we have limited options since MS does not terminate the BGP neighborship during maintenance.
 Thank you for your assistance.

 Should I just clean install and restore?
 I have a pair of 3395 on 2.7 patch 7 and need to get to 3.1 asap

Dell says each node on the power store should have the two ports configured as LACP. There&#x27;s two VLANs for the data traffic for redundancy, so how do I need to configure the port group that is connected to each node? Do I need to have the port group set for trunking with both VLANs used for the data network? Sorry if this is a dumb question, I&#x27;m not a full time network engineer.

 They all show up as non juniper on our gear. But work. 
 I recently got some qsfp cables coded for Juniper only, and bam, no ugly hardware messages. 
 These folks only make direct attach cables though.
 So will fs com stuff show up not ugly if used on juniper?
 Bonus question: do they have ones that are compatible with Dell/EMC/Compellant?

                              <span>Situation: Hey all, i&#x27;ve spent way too much time on this and need some help. I am entry/Jr level in terms of networking so please forgive me if I get something wrong or make a bad assumption.
 I&#x27;m using a network emulator to emulate data traffic for load testing in the near future. It&#x27;s connected to a L3 switch that I&#x27;m sending the data TO and the goal (for now) is to simply be able to route the data back to the switch.
 The emulator and the switch are in an isolated environment where only the management ports/console are connected to the network. I have an ethernet cable going from port 2 on the emulator to port 1 on the switch.
 ultimate goal right now is sending a simple ICMP ping. The pcap is port captured data from the eth interface in the emulator. It shows:

                              <span>Hey there, I put this as design since Layer 3 switching is basically routing and I&#x27;m speaking in theories here so nothing to troubleshoot yet. I hope I chose right. 
 Here&#x27;s my scenario: I was provisioned /30 (Comcast calls this the Layer 3 IP Information) and a /29 (Customer Usable IP Information) provided by Comcast for fiber circuit and I need to install a switch at my headquarters. Their Juniper Switch is the last devices within their responsibility and has one port configured to give my switch .102 in the /30.
 I&#x27;m getting a Layer 3 switch eventually but I&#x27;d like to bring this circuit up sooner (back order).
 Here are some questions:
  
Do I need to use a Layer 3 switch or can I just use an unmanaged switch and configure the adapters on the things I plug in like my voice appliance and my firewall? 
 I have a layer 3 switch available with some open ports. Can I segment those ports into a different VLAN? I&#x27;m not totally sure how to do this but I think it can be done.
  
Thanks!

                              <span>It&#x27;s the same old story. I&#x27;m overworked and bored with traditional networking. I would love to learn and implement newer more exciting tech, but I&#x27;m too busy with boring projects and putting out fires. It feels like a new job will be the same as the old job. I feel like to need to start my own business or get out of tech completely. Any thoughts are appreciated.

                              <span>Hi, so I&#x27;m at the start of migrating traffic over to an entirely new outbound pair of Palo Alto 3220&#x27;s. Tonight I migrated over one of our lower end environments across to them, all went fine, security rules worked great etc.. the main issue was around a NAT rule I wanted to use for each environment, basically, we have a public address ranges that our WAN external firewalls sit on and an entirely different /27 public routed range that isn&#x27;t on the same subnet etc.. this range is used on the current t ASA solution for certain environments, I wanted to use the free ones and migrate the ones in use across to the PA&#x27;s in the end. To begin with I was using a free public address in this routed range to put on this environment along with a catch-all PAT to the outside interface as an alternative. Currently during my testing on one of my test vm&#x27;s, the outside PAT works fine, however, when I turned on the source NAT to this free public address tonight, traffic dropped and stopped on my test VM! I have no clue why. The rule itself is setup like this:
 Scr zone : inside Dst zone : Internet Scr add : lower end environment range Dst add : any Scr translation : dynamic-ip-and-port to the public ip address object which is a /32 Dst translation: none
 Can someone tell me if I&#x27;m missing something here on the PA&#x27;s? The NAT rule, security rule where both being hit on the counter and I could see the NAT sessions being natted to the routed public address as well on the CLI. Could it just be something the other end with our PE router providers?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi, so I&#x27;m in the middle of putting together an options paper for 3 lots of firewalls, one of which will be the one selected for the job. 
 First being Palo Alto (my preferred choice), they just WORK, is the best way I can sum it up, experience with them and don&#x27;t need to upskill on them when time is an issue too
 Firepower (more of management preference because its Cisco), I have more experience with Firepower which is precisely why I won&#x27;t be going for them, but they&#x27;re something to put down on the paper, so...🤷🏻‍♂️
 Third and final option to fill the last option will be Ciscos SD-WAN ISR router application/layer 7 firewall features. We use the SD-WAN side of things, but I wouldn&#x27;t know where to start with the firewall features of them. I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s a non starter, purely because of time that is available to me, how do they perform under stress or normal load using an SSL proxy, and normal firewall rule processing? It&#x27;s a router first and foremost and shouldn&#x27;t be used as a firewall if we don&#x27;t have to, simple as essentially. But I&#x27;m curious to know if others have used them for this purpose and what their experiences have been?
 The Palo I&#x27;ll end up getting in probably won&#x27;t need more than 1Gb interfaces as well to be honest, if that helps in terms of bandwidth

 I know this has to be possible because if you do a write erase and delete this file on the flash: and then put the USB back in, it will do something with the nvram_config and bring back the configuration. But I am wondering if it is possible to do an inlace restore. 
 Is there a place I can find this information?

                              <span>Hi everyone.
 Recently I have been playing with python in an attempt to automate some things in our heterogenous and rather large network.
 So far I&#x27;ve been running all scripts locally on my machine, but I would like to share these with my team and also schedule some tasks overnight, when my laptop is asleep.
 So I was thinking of setting up a dedicated linux VM to host and run all the scripts. I would also like to integrate this with some git repository, so I can code on my machine and then push the revised scripts to this server while keeping track of any changes.
 How do you run python automation in your organization? What are some best practices you would recommend? 
 Thank you!

 For example I can describe relationship between IGP and iBGP as such that iBGP depends on reachability information provided by IGP in order to form BGP sessions where BGP speakers can then exchange their own NLRI. In the same ligh what does RSVP/OSPF provide to each other?

                              <span>I have a list of over 1,000 switches, routers, and FWs from multiple vendors (Cisco (ios, iosxe, nxos, asa), Palo alto, arista)
 And I want iterate throu them to gather their model and software version.
 Problem is I don&#x27;t have the device_type info, just their hostnames/IPs
 I tried using the netmiko SSHDetect module but it looks like it only detects when it&#x27;s a Cisco device.
 I ended up writing a convoluted script that... Basically if a connection fails due to wrong device type, I have it try another device type. It works but it&#x27;s messy.
 I was wondering if there&#x27;s a better way to get the device type info from a list of network devices with just their IPs/hostnames

                              <span>Hey,
 If specific routes have unkown and IGP origin codes, then what will be the origin code of aggregate address (as-set is appended on aggregated router).
 I did some lab work and I can see only unknown(?) Origin code is inherited from individual routes.
 I know we can change attributes of summarized address with attribute-map I am just wondering why unknown origin code is inherited by default any reasons for this?

                              <span>We are doing cloud backups to Wasabi using Veeam.
 Since the backups are big I want to use our 1Gbps ISP line to send the data to Wasabi.
 So wasbi is using our Veeam server as its gateway so I set a route in our sonicwall to let the Veeam server use the 1gbps ISP as its gateway out to the internet.
 After doing this I am not seeing much of a speed increase in Download but I do see a difference in the upload. 70Mbps Down 200Mbps Up. Compared to the 40Mbps Down 44Mbps Up on our normal ISP line.
 If I do a speed test directly from our WAN switch I get close to 1Gbps.
 The speed is causing 2 issues, the backups don’t complete during the backup window we give it if we let the backups run after the backup window we get reports from users that the VPN is slow. After stopping the backups the VPN speed is much better.
 A bit green here and hoping for some guidance on optimizing this.
 Thank you in advance for any input

 Im trying to set up lag on the TP-SG3452XP.
 I have connected Port 50 and 51 together using the switch setup page, Each port was tested and connected on there own before I connected them together without issue.
 Now they have connected and the adapters in the windows network setting have been connected together as a bridge.
 My issue is that the switch seems to not like what I have done.

 Any hints on what I might have missed?
 Or anything else you need to understand what I am trying to do?

 Edit;
 PC has a 4 port NIC (X710-T4)

                              <span>Hi,
 i have few folders on my laptop (mostly arduino code) that i would want to keep safe from fire/being stolen. I have second pc in basement that is used almost daily, so buying nas seems non worth investing.
 I want to automatically copy selected folders from one pc to selected folder in other pc, whenever something was changed and both pc are currently in the same network. Is there way to do this? 
 One pc is using win7 and second one win10. 
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sorry for such easy question, but i can only find information how to share folders or how to build real nas from pc.

                              <span>Hello,
 I&#x27;m dealing with a very weird setup at the moment and I&#x27;m not even sure if it&#x27;s possible so I thought I&#x27;d ask here.
 I have an old phone system working off of PSTN, it has 2 line ports which ordinarly go to phone line ports.
 The customers want to go onto VOIP so we&#x27;ve got a Cisco ATA 191 registered to Voiceflex, my question was would there be a way of using this Cisco ATA 191 phone ports for the Line 1 &amp; 2 ports on the PBX?
 I know its a weird ask but I thought i&#x27;d check here, in theory (and in my head) it should work straight away, I have tried it and the Cisco ATA 191 thinks the phone ports (plugged into the line ports) are &quot;off the hook&quot;.
 Has anyone ever dealt with anything like this before / know if its possible even?

 However, I have never seen these M12 connectors anywhere; and I have been working in IT for over 20 years.
 Are they relatively new or are they only used for veeeery specific special applications?
 I know it says they are mainly used in industrial applications, but I have never seen them there either...
 Thank you for any enlightenment.

You can see the live speeds in the results page but it only records errors in the log. TIA.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve worked on this two days now and can&#x27;t make any progress on what is going on.
 I have an outbuilding linked by an Aerohive wireless bridge. The outbuilding bridge AP is linked to a switch, which has two APs (also Aerohive) broadcasting the access SSIDs. All VLAN 1. If I connect to any of the access SSIDs, I get DHCP, pings, internet access, all good. But if I connect to the switch, nothing. No DHCP. No pings to gateway or other devices even when I have a valid manual IP address on the subnet. 
 So maybe the switch is being weird? Nope, put in a new switch, exact same behavior.
 So I thought, maybe the APs are meshed into the bridge AP, or maybe into the main building APs directly? Nope, if I isolate the APs on their own VLANs, they lose their DHCP and connectivity on the wireless networks. 
 So what else could it be? Can Aerohive bridges somehow share a link that only Aerohive APs can pick up? Some sort of tunnel? Is there anything I can do to get the wired connections on the switch live?
 To be clear, everything works fine in the main building, e.g., wired and wireless client connect without issue, plenty of available DHCP addresses, no MAC filtering.
 Any help will be greatly appreciated. I don&#x27;t want to have to scrap the whole wing just to get a couple wired devices on the network.

                              <span>Greetings,
 Up until last week, I had two in-wall LG dual inverter AC units running side by side, doing a fine job of cooling my 10 x 10 x 8 server room. We&#x27;re in a heat wave right now with temperatures above 100 F and these coolers all of a sudden just stopped cooling. I have about ten 2U servers in there plus three 2U UPS units.
 I bought these coolers about 1.5 years ago and they ran through last year&#x27;s heatwave just fine, but now it seems like they just can&#x27;t get rid of the heat anymore, I&#x27;ve got some backups in there right now, but I&#x27;m hesitant to just buy more coolers without knowing what went wrong.
 Any expert opinions on this matter?

                              <span>We are a hybrid environment. We have &quot;security defaults&quot; disabled because we need the ability to selectively disable MFA on a per user basis. You lose this ability when security defaults is turned on.
 In a best case scenario, I&#x27;d like to achieve the following. When we create a new user on-prem and after AAD connect runs and syncs the user up into O365 we want to make sure that MFA is enabled by default for that new user. I don&#x27;t want to have to wait up to 30 minutes after we have created the account for the sync to finish, then login to the O365 portal and then manually enable MFA for the new user. We want this to be automatic.
 How would I achieve this? We could set up a conditional access policy, but I don&#x27;t know exactly what to configure to make that a reality. The Microsoft support rep we spoke with says even if we did a conditional access policy, we would still have to manually enable MFA for the new user, which is what we&#x27;re trying to avoid.

                              <span>I used to love IT, networking specifically. Now I&#x27;m basically an IT contractor. I used to love configuring network devices with the CLI, planning out networks, I eventually want to get into cybersecurity. I normally love problem solving and I used to be thrilled to learn about technologies. Now I just hate it. I hate working with 365, project planning/managing, doing file migrations, email, cutovers, working with software vendors, and working with our customers. I&#x27;m starting to resent my coworkers and company as whole. I&#x27;m not sure how to remedy the situation because this was my only career choice. This is my 3rd IT job and I don&#x27;t remember hating my old ones like this. The work was similar, albeit less moving parts. I&#x27;m not sure if IT is not the career for me, or if my current job is just killing the passion. I have my N+, A+, and I&#x27;m working toward Sec+. I am so disinteresed/frustrated with work I don&#x27;t have the motivation to read my CompTIA books anymore, but the thought of abandoning something I used to be so passionate about breaks my heart. Any advice is appreciated, thanks.
 EDIT: this got way more responses than i anticipated! i dont have time today to reapond to everyone, but i have lots to consider now. I feel a lot better about the situation after reading so many perspectives. thank you guys so much for the insightful advice.

                              <span>I&#x27;ve dealt with plenty of user termination tickets in my 21 year career, but today was for a fallen comrade. On a team of just a few dozen, I had to disable the account of a teammate after his unexpected passing over the weekend. Nothing quite prepares you for processing a sudden loss of a colleague you interact with daily and then having to also continue operating the business and deal with the logistics of the circumstances. To my fellow sysadmin, you will be deeply missed.
 EDIT: Greatly appreciate all the support and stories! I hope this has allowed some of you who&#x27;ve experienced the same thing to reflect on those who have passed like I have done today.

                              <span>I remember a good conversation some time ago about if an IT role reports to finance it is a big red flag. While currently job hunting i&#x27;m regularly encountering IT Manager and IT Director roles reporting to CFO. 
 Thoughts? Good, Bad, indifferent?

 Not only costs but things not working, latency issues etc 
 Do you guys have experiences of this
 Edit: cheers all for the replies. Much appreciated. Every one a good and interesting read.
 I&#x27;m now off to shout at MS support because my email is down 😂😭😭😭

                              <span>This is a sanity check before I start drafting my H1 performance reviews. I’m at a big healthcare company and the company as a whole has actually done pretty well and is expanding. 
 The problem is that all the major system improvements (can’t be too specific because I don’t want to identify myself) I wanted to do are nowhere near where they should be. 
 Looking back, my team has been just trying to keep our heads above water in terms of system uptime, tickets closed, and other unplanned work. 
 I need to come up with a presentation to our CTO and CEO outlining the progress so far this year and plans for the last half of 2023. 
 Any advice on how to position this and outlining how not to repeat from July on?

 Tragically, our PS script that we had been using previously that accomplished this broke with the Azure API updates. And if anyone is interested in taking a crack at identifying/fixing the broken script, I can send it to you to take a look at. But I&#x27;ve been beating my head against a wall trying to fix the syntax all last week but just keep getting more errors.
 Regardless, we are happy to start fresh with a modern audit AD + Azure AD user audit script that any of you are currently using if you&#x27;re willing to share it.

                              <span>If you allow it, self-service recovery could be abused by rogue employees to bypass USB write restrictions and DLP restrictions to exfiltrate data. They can remove the drive, mount it to another PC and use the recovery key to unlock it so they can copy any data they want to their own device prior to leaving the company.
 If you don’t allow it, an attacker could social engineer the help desk to provide them with the recovery key to a stolen laptop over the phone or email. This bypasses any user MFA process that could have been applied if they always referred the users to use self-service recovery.
 What’s the better option?

                              <span>Having a weird problem that I can&#x27;t figure out. We did an in place upgrade on a 2016 server to 2022. Since that every once in a while the server will freeze up for 20 seconds, you can click on the windows on the taskbar but you can&#x27;t do anything with the windows. Looking into the event log I cannot find anything useful. I was on the server after hours without anyone else logged into it and the event log showed nothing at the time it happened. All I have been able to find online was the firewall rule fix and the microsoft ink fix. Neither one worked, and after those two things the entire server lost the ability to print, gives an error saying &quot;cannot create print job&quot;. I&#x27;ve tried SFC, DISM, check disk. If anyone has any other ideas I am all ears.

 Have any of you gone down the route of just using a single remote access software and how did that work out? Our management is &quot;debating&quot; removal of TeamViewer. Is there a product that could replace it for a significantly better cost but similar in terms of ease of use?

                              <span>Yeah, this development is not something to be messed around with. Yet, this is Google&#x27;s retort:
  
I think this is the time to tell you that I already reported this to Google, and they say this is not a security vulnerability (probably because this secret browser is not very popular), and that the parental control bypass is the “Intended Behavior”
  
We know that not only that browser extensions can be malicious, but so can Google&#x27;s own shortsightedness.

 Wed like to connect AzureAD where Bob Smith (BSmith) already has an account in cloud, with BSmith locally on the DC so that they can use the single account/password.
 I was hoping there was a solution that didn&#x27;t involve manually editing attributes...and didn&#x27;t involve new local profiles.

                              <span>Hey there!
 I work in the cybersecurity sphere and, recently, I prepared reviews on the most needed cybersecurity tools and software for my business clients.
 A month ago, I added a comparison table of the best business password managers. There’re prices, feature lists, scores, explanations, and some other details on each manager.
 https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yE9Va9s8FmFltAyAGxpNlK7hTrUFMDkAwIgsPSfeLNg/edit?usp&#x3D;sharing 
 You can find there 1Password, NordPass, LastPass, Keeper, DashLane, BitWarden, and a bunch of other solutions.
 ​
 A quick overview of the research I made:
  
Only around 50% of all password managers went through any external cybersecurity audits.
 All password managers have a high-level encryption algorithm, but I, personally, think that the best is XChaCha20.…</span>

                              <span>Hey guys,
 i have to create a guideline for my company regarding erasing disks from all data before they go back into storage or before they go to another user.
 For this i bought a version of &quot;parted magic&quot; because i had good experiences with it in the past.
 Now for my question: What exactly is the difference between Secure Erase and Sanitize?
 I thought, that secure erase only deletes the mapping table or did so in the past. But according to the tooltip in &quot;parted magic&quot; Secure Erase ALSO overwrites everything with 0 or resets the NAND to 0 via a volt spike.
 So why is sanitize better than secure erase if in the end you still have only zeros everywhere.
 I read that sanitize also has stuff like crpyto scramble. But does that really matter if the data was overwritten anyway?
 Thank you for your help!
 Greetings from Germany :)

                              <span>Ever since we started to work with and support M365 and other &quot;Cloud&quot;-Services, just waiting and drinking tea until it magically works again, has been more viable than changing options that worked perfectly fine before and possibly messing up five other things in the process.
 Like seriously, we are spending hours troubleshooting some ExO issues until the customer calls and suddenly all is fine again without anything being changed or done.
 Just me or anyone else experiencing the same phenomenon?

                              <span>Apologies but asking here as /r/linuxquestions is still locked.
 I work for a private ISP, we sell managed networks to customers with various services. I have a VMware ESXi server, and to simplify things let&#x27;s say it currently has 10 VMs, each VM having a management NIC, and a customer VLAN NIC. Currently I can use a service like NRPE to execute commands on each VM, and NRPE runs a networking command (like a cURL, ping, or similar) over the customer network NIC. The NRPE agent listens on the management NIC, but executes the commands over the customer VLAN NIC.
 Customer wise, for simplicity we&#x27;ll say customers are called Customer1, Customer2, Customer3, and so on. Their VLANs correspond like 10, 20, 30, and so on. Each customer network has an identical IP space of 10.0.0.0/8, and the IP of this VM will be identical in each of the networks.
 I&#x27;m building a new VM which has a single management NIC, and a single trunk NIC (VLAN 4095 in VMware parlance). I&#x27;ve tested configuring the secondary NIC on the VM as Customer1 with VLAN 10 tagged, and that works fine (so the port is all good), but I&#x27;m having trouble with network namespaces. My end goal is to be able to run commands like ip netns exec customer1 ping 8.8.8.8 and get the results (quick crap example, but you get the idea).
 I tried to borrow the principles from [this article] but it wouldn&#x27;t work for me. 
 Is what I&#x27;m trying to do possible?

 we have some virtual Windows servers (mainly 2012 R2) with MBR partitions used to store files, the problem is the 2tb limit that we need to remove.
 What&#x27;s the best strategy to migrate to GPT minimizing the downtime ?

                              <span>Hi,
 I got a weird issue that has been going on couple of months now and I decided to get to the bottom of it once an for all.
 We all use lenovo laptops which are connected to a docking station, and the DS is connected to two monitors.
 In our Group Policy Settings we have our default power plan which manages couple of settings, one of which is Display-&gt;Turn off display after: on battery 15min, plugged in 15min.
 When this is active, my and every other monitor in the company goes off/ to sleep mode after 30 seconds, but only on LOCK SCREEN! No matter how many minutes i select in GPO and apply it I always see the same result. If the Windows are not locked then it works like expected.
 Only if I set the display to never turn off (so 0 in GPO) and never on energy settings in Windows does the monitor stay awake - but this is not something that we want. After you are not around for 15-20 minutes there is no reason to keep the monitors turned on.
 Hybrid sleep is off. The monitor settings have been checked multiple times, there is no any power saving mode active. The same thing happens if the laptop is on its own, the display will turn off in a matter of seconds. I did not check the bios settings, but this should not cause the problem?
 ​
 Cheers!

                              <span>Hi,
 question for my fellow gerrit hosting admins. We&#x27;ve recently migrated to a Google Workspace and started using their &quot;secure ldap&quot; as the LDAP provider.
 Because of slow and long responses we&#x27;ve started caching some of the data such as 
 [cache &quot;accounts&quot;]
 maxAge &#x3D; 1 hour
 [cache &quot;ldap_groups&quot;]
 maxAge &#x3D; 1 hour
 [cache &quot;ldap_groups_byinclude&quot;]
 maxAge &#x3D; 1 hour
 [cache &quot;ldap_usernames&quot;]
 maxAge &#x3D; 1 hour
 But according to our employees, listing/suggest reviewers is still very slow, I&#x27;ve searched through documentation and forums, but I couldn&#x27;t find what data could I cash to speed it up. 
 Also, another question, any others tips for using gerrit and a cloud ldap provider (besides don&#x27;t do it, because that was my response as well)

 Current setup:
 All singins are transferred to a log analytics workspace. There I&#x27;ve set up an alert with the following query: 
 SigninLogs | where Status.errorCode !&#x3D; 0 // Filter all successful logins | extend City&#x3D;LocationDetails.city, State&#x3D;LocationDetails.state, Country&#x3D;LocationDetails.countryOrRegion, Error_Code&#x3D;Status.errorCode, Failure_Reason&#x3D;Status.failureReason | project TimeGenerated, UserDisplayName, AppDisplayName, IPAddress, City, State, Country, AuthenticationRequirement, Failure_Reason, ConditionalAccessStatus, ConditionalAccessPolicies, Error_Code 
 On success (currently 10 lines in 3 hours) it sends an email. But this is triggering a lot of false positives. Looking for help slimming this down to more useful results...

 I&#x27;ve been looking for a solution about this that I could deploy through GPO but the only thing I could find was people being pissed, but no clear GPO setting to turn off that shit.
 Anyone got a tip for me ? 
 Also, F*** Microsoft for this. It&#x27;s always unwarranted changes like that that make my job more difficult.

 We have a client and the users do not have administration rights, they have an app installed that needs an update almost everyday.
 I wonder if they are able to without administration rights.
 Any tips if not?

                              <span>I&#x27;m designing a new infrastructure to host a web application with some security requirements, because it will hold sensitive data. The application can work with SQL Server or MySQL, It will run one database per each user and the goal is to minimize the impact of a potential penetration, and our team is discussing two scenarios, 1) One SQL Server with hardening techniques applied 2) run each database on a dockerized instance of MySQL, we know that this last option also requires hardening at docker layer. Any opinion will be useful.

                              <span>Hi all,
 I&#x27;m in the process of deploying WDAC in a customer environment. One of the things I&#x27;ve started to notice is how long the WDAC Wizard takes to both merge and update XML policies, the larger they get (20 minutes to 45 minutes). Does anyone know if it&#x27;s possible to speed this process up or is this simply as long as it takes? The base XML file for this policy is ~18 MB.
 Thanks so much in advance.

                              <span>Hello.
 Only starting with networks, so apologies if this is a stupid question.
 I have been put in (de facto) charge of a smallish AV network and I&#x27;m learning as I go along. We have four Netgear switches addressed 172.16.0.250-253 on a 255.255.0.0 subnet. All four keep sending out an ARP request to discover who 172.16.0.255 is every second. This address is unallocated. Why do they do this and is it suboptimal?
 Almost everything (~150 devices) is on static IP address, but I believe that the devices are inconsistent in their subnet configuration; that is to say some have been configured 255.255.255.0 and some have been configured 255.255.0.0. Is this the cause for the ARP?
 Thanks for any assistance!

                              <span>Small enterprise organization is getting 500/500 from ISP, but the only devices getting this speed are the on-site servers. All other devices are usually getting 150-200 download speeds and 300-400 upload speeds. Even when I bypass the firewall and connect directly to the ISP&#x27;s Adva FSP 150, none of the devices I&#x27;m trying (mix of Dell Latitudes and Lenovo Thinkpads) are getting the correct speed.
 ISP verified duplex speed was set to 1000Mbps Auto (Fortinet firewall was set manually to 1000Full and auto-negotiate, no change). There don&#x27;t seem to be any packets being dropped. I&#x27;ve tried setting the DNS manually (the server itself, google, cloudfare) on the end devices to see if that changes anything, but no change there. Bandwidth usage is normal. Tried troubleshooting during active hours and also after hours, no change in speed. Tried adjusting TCP Window Scaling Settings on end-devices, updating drivers, verifying cables were un-damaged CAT5e or CAT6 cables, trying different network profile settings on end-devices, manually setting IP information, checked for malware...
 Can anyone offer me any advice or tips as to what I should be looking for here? I&#x27;ve been searching for answers online for a couple of weeks and nothing that has come up is helping.

                              <span>Hi Folks
 I run a small home automation/control business and i need to provide better documentation to onsite engineers.
 Im trying to find some software that will allow me to assign hardware to rooms/areas and assign IP ranges, then export a CSV or document of some type.
 It would be great to be able to provide engineers with this that they could then populate with MAC and Serial numbers for example.
 Is there any software that would help with this?

                              <span>Hey guys!
 I&#x27;m trying to setup a LACP/LAGG connection.
 I have a few questions and was hoping folks around here might have some clue:
  
Do individual interfaces on a LAG have different IP addresses?
 If I had to setup a mac-binding - if the interfaces show up as a single ip, what mac address will it have?
 If the interfaces have separate IPs, does that mean eventually the TCP/IP ports are also effectively doubled?
  
I have so much confusion here, hoping someone would clear it for me 😅

 I have been bashing my head against a wall over an issue and I&#x27;m hoping that posting about it could hopefully lead to someone who has had a similar issue point me in the right direction.
 Some background:
 Until very recently we were using Comcast Business VoiceEdge as my VoIP provider. Initially this was chosen because it came with it&#x27;s own internet connection, and at the time we were pretty bandwidth starved.
 Fast forward five years later, and we are no longer bandwidth starved, and I decided to get rid of Comcast (finally!) and switch to Vonage as our VoIP provider as it ended up being cheaper and came with a LOT more features and didn&#x27;t have a backend interface that feels like it was written by students in a 5th grade intro to website design class.
 The voiceedge system, if yo…</span>

                              <span>Versa headend hosted in aws and trying to deploy branch using cms. (Tried bare metal as well and same result)
 When deployed, from the director, branch is reachable via public IPs and vice versa. Also confirmed the ports are open to get them on board.
 When deployed, IPsec connects and disconnects multiple time and eventually it disconnects and shows ptvi down, not sure what is the issue here.
 Does branch needs to reach any of OOB IPs of headend? (Mgmt, controller, analytic) 
 I see the branch is registered on the Director. It seems like it&#x27;s not establishing ipsec tunnel.

I see cool projects like SONiC, FRR, Quagga, Cumulus Linux, OpenvSwitch etc. Learning is not the problem but I ask myself where will I apply these? I have applied all my networking in an enterprise setup where open networking is non existant. 
 Anyone with similar interests, how is your journey towards learning and applying this.

From a few google searches I found that it stands for AutoStore Status Monitoring Protocol. I am new to networking and am not sure what exactly this service does, and I can’t find any information on google other than the port that it typically runs on. Anyone able to provide some info on this? Thanks

                              <span>Lately I’ve been looking to see if there are any native options there that support cloud file share as well as a similar fashion of ACLs and locking down folder permissions likely your typical NTFS shares. 
 Our environment has a presence of AADDS (Azure AD domain services), however, this isn’t on-prem and it’s soely used for virtual machines, only. 
 Our machines are AAD Cloud joined, and our user identities are also cloud sourced. From looking, the only native option for file share in Azure is Azure Files, and it doesn’t support NTFS permissions, plus only works with storage account keys. You can only truly use Kerberos and ACL permissions if your identities are hybrid, (the devices can still be AAD joined in this case) 
 Given the fact that, if we were to have our identities hybrid, we’d be able to receive Kerberos tickets on an AAD joined machine, in result this opens a few doors for us, without even having the need to hybrid join machines. 
 The other option would be to dump 10+ TB into sharepoint, however, to me, that makes absolutely no sense as Sharepoint Online is not meant to replace a file system. 
 Thoughts? Would it better a better option to ditch the managed domain in AADDS and move to ADDS? Users would be hybrid, devices would still be cloud joined. So it wouldn’t necessarily be completely moving to “on-prem”, plus if we already have and utilize Azure AD domain services, I don’t really see a point in it, being that Azure AD domain services is extremely limited and probably better for a mom &amp; pop shop type of environment.

 Do ya&#x27;ll folks use git for your orchestration files. I usually have a separate S3 bucket to back up and track my yaml files for docker compose and expansible playbooks. We are moving to adopt k8s in the near future. We are using terraform as well and was thinking about just throwing this over to our git. The problem is that a lot of our products are micro services and we are already filling up our git with a lot of repos. Are any of ya&#x27;ll just using git or are you segmenting your infra code from your app code?

                              <span>We have recently noticed an unusual issue impacting several clients where Google Chrome is seemingly hanging on SSL handshake when connecting to new websites.
 The issue appears to cause the SSL to hang when the website is loading, usually taking 10-20 seconds before the &quot;Initial Connection&quot; completes. Once the website loads the issue goes away until you start a new browser session.

 Troubleshooting
 First, we suspected a server-side issue, but this occurs on MANY different unrelated websites, in-fact nearly any website has the same issue if it is using HTTPS.
 Secondly, we have tested using different Internet connections, ISPs, mobile hotspot, DNS servers and Proxy servers, all which did not resolve the issue, this leans me to believe this is purely a device-level issue.
 We have tested different browsers, Edge (Chromium) and Firefox do NOT experience this issue, only Google Chrome. Furthermore, we have not had any reports from MacOS users yet, only windows users. All windows machines running the latest OS updates.
 Updating to the latest version of chrome does not resolve the issue. Older versions, beta, etc also experience the issue.
 My suspicion is that there is an issue relating to both windows/chrome interacting together that is causing the SSL/Initial Connection to hang for a long period of time when loading pages. But I cannot isolate any particular cause.
 Im at a loss for where to look next at this point, the issue seems to be disconnected from any specific client, software, policy, etc. 
 Would like to hear if any other Techs out there have seen anything like this? Let me know if you have any tips for what we can try next....

                              <span>Recently, me and a few friends discussed how we all work in ”IT” and to our friends and family we probably all do the same stuff as each other. Despite sharing similar job titles, it became evident that our daily work experiences were incredibly diverse, highlighting the vast range of responsibilities each of us held. 
 So there for I&#x27;m genuinely curious to hear about the workdays of you guys/gals/pals and how they differ. It would be cool to hear what your job title is, what kind of company you work for, size of the company, and most importantly please share how a typical day in the life looks for you?
 I fully acknowledge that this topic has likely been covered before, but I&#x27;ve always enjoyed reading such posts, so here we are! 
 Hope u have a great day!

                              <span>I need to convert some physical Windows Servers to Virtual Machines. I&#x27;m presently using VMware vCenter Converter to do this. However, I am running into some potential issues.
 There are two physical DC&#x27;s. The primary appears to be a core. The secondary is standard. I can convert the second, but the primary fails.
 The DC that I have successfully converted, has a storage space of 400+ GB. Not all of it is used, but all of it appears in the conversion. Is there any way to cut this down and only use what is necessary? I don&#x27;t have a ton of spare space presently.
 Edit: I&#x27;ve responded to a few of you, but it&#x27;s clear that I just need to rebuild into a new VM. 
 I just need to review the process first. Will hopefully get this done this week.
 Thank you all for the help. If you have additional advice regarding the process to do this...let me know. 
 I have several spare 2019 licenses. 2022 licenses would need to be acquired (extremely slow process). I don&#x27;t want to remain on 2012.

 Part of the system involves an in-house application responsible for orchestration of the whole mess. From GUI&#x27;s, shared memory, data acquisition and distribution across hardware IO and several networks, starting and stopping .exe&#x27;s etc etc. you get the idea. 
 As you might imagine, there&#x27;s a good deal of co-ordination necessary to ensure each compute node has the right config.
 Today, the team has the application architecture so that each relevant node connects to multiple SMB shares on PC login. And pretty much everything runs directly from the network shares (yay) including writ…</span>

 Sometimes there is a problem and they open up a ticket on their end, and add a bunch of people on my team to the ticket.
 I&#x27;d really prefer they opened a ticket with us, but I then had to stop and think about how that would work. I suppose they could email our ticketing email address and open one that way.
 Curious how others handle this.
 They do not have access to any of our systems nor accounts in our domain and they never will.

 Im curious how other teams of a similar size (~6) manage re-occurring tasks / obligations eg
  
Tickets - Daily
 Monitoring checks - Daily
 Vulnerability Checks - Weekly
 ​
  
At $OLDWORK$ i wrote a checklist system that would populate each day with new tasks / or on a schedule. I could rebuild it here, but im sure there is either an O/S equivalent, or a better way of doing things
 Ideally I&#x27;d like something that could send reminders if tasks havnt been completed. Bonus points for supporting multiple task schedules / across multiple teams.
 We do have access to existing tools like ServiceNow, Confluence/Jira etc, O365 etc.

                              <span>Hi,
 I work at a primarily Windows focused company and 90% of our servers are Windows Servers and we utilize all the usual Windows Server roles. Nothing special there.
 We do have a few Linux servers running as well, since we have some solutions that either require Linux or just &quot;belongs&quot; on Linux. Right now we just have non-managed admin accounts for each admin on these servers, but that really doesn&#x27;t comply with best practices and our own policies. It&#x27;s mostly Ubuntu Server 20.04 and 22.04, so is there an easy way to either join them to Active Directory for managing these admin accounts, or create an alternative user directory just for these servers? I guess that Active Directory would be the best solution.
 We don&#x27;t need much in term of functionality, &quot;just&quot; a simple but stable way to manage admin accounts. What are our options?

 Bit of background, our current environment consists of:
 1 Primary Site Server CB2111 with all roles in one box including WSUS
 1 CMG Server (currently in process of updating to vm Scale Set so we can update SCCM Version)
 15 Distribution Servers
 ~15k devices
 I&#x27;ll try my best to explain the scenarios but it gets confusing thinking about it.
 We are already in the process of expanding our configuration into an HA setup and would like some clarrification/advice as to best cause of action

 1 DR Passive Site Server
 Site Servers will connect to SQLAG using CNAME
 WSUS/Reporting Where?
 Can the SUP roles still exist on both site server and passive server, but only the DB offloaded?

 Would it make sense to merge the other MS365 tenant into ours or leave it separate in case he ever sells it off in the future?
 I know IT management would be a lot easier bringing in their AD environment, syncing with one MS365 tenant, etc.. We could just create aliases for email and so forth.
 I&#x27;m just not sure how painful it would be to separate the companies in the future since we&#x27;d have to work with whoever they bring in as the IT folks and if they are going to be easy to work with or not.

 For some companies i have 10 VLANs, and still could need more. But I am wondering what is &quot;normal&quot; to have.

                              <span>Hi all,
 We’ve recently found out that our ldap and m365 accounts aren’t alligned when it comes to password expiry. Writeback is turned on, users can reset their pw on 365 and will sync with ldap and vice versa if we reset it in AD.
 Issue is, if the expiry policy for ldap kicks in (90 days) and M365 keeps going. I found an article about EnforceCloudPasswordPolicyForPasswordSyncedUsers is disabled by default.
 Before sending in a change request, if I enable this setting on, will this just replicate our ldap pw expiry policy?
 We’re a K-12 and student passwords aren’t set to expire while staff are set to 90 days.
 Has anyone turned on this feature and can share their experience? Will greatly appreciate.
 Thanks

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been a sysadmin for about 10 years with my company, slowly pushing them away from vendors and towards all internally managed systems.
 I learned what I needed to on the networking side of things, but never went too deep, until now.
 Our current Cisco core/users stacks went EOL last year, so I took on the project of upgrading them all to Meraki. I planned everything out and we had the cutover yesterday. We had a few little easily solvable issues, but only one persistent one that I can&#x27;t seem to figure out.
 We have two mitel5000 phone systems. The original configuration had both uplinks to those system set as access, so I just mirrored that on the Meraki. both phone systems have two IP addresses and on both phone systems only one of the two is showing online. In the office, its sporadic, but some phones are online and some are stuck on contacting server.
 We just use VLAN1 for voip, and the VLAN DHCP Relays are working fine with everything else. I can ping both phone system gateways from the 192.168.1.1 subnet on the meraki, but every other subnet fails.
 Networking is far from my forte, so this may well be something stupid easy, but it&#x27;s got me stumped so any help is appreciated!

                              <span>Hey all,
 ​
 Just wanted to check in for a brief update after my last big post.
 First and foremost, thankyou. 
 I had a large number of helpful responses in the last post, as well as some people reaching out to me via direct messages, offering anything from advice to work opportunities. 
 Apologies to those who DM&#x27;ed me since I never responded - I wanted to more sort my head out before responding to them, but appreciated the thought regardless.
 ​
 I ended up talking to the boss about my workload, where things are at, where I&#x27;m going, pay, stuff like that.
 Unfortunately, the discussion didn&#x27;t really go anywhere - he has no input on pay, and he pushed the management of my workload to me. Told me to start saying no to things and manage things better and a few other fairly unhelpful ideas.

 ​
 i am in charge of a hotel, which is going to open soon. 4 Servers, 25 PCs, as of know. Since its a family business, im the &quot;only&quot; sysadmin and in charge of the full 4 floors, and the nearby restaurant when its finished.
 ​
 I&#x27;ll keep it short: Would you deploy Windows 10 or Windows 11 Enterprise right now? I tend to 10, but looking at 2025, i think 11 would be better.
 ​
 Please help me out, what do you think? :D

                              <span>Hi,
 I&#x27;m looking for ways to secure our backups even more and thought about the idea of controlling access to our NAS, that contains the Veeam Copy backups. I thought it would be nice to have a powerswitch that can be controlled by Veeam, by using a pre/ post backup script. When the backup copy starts, the controlled powerswitch turns on a simple (unmanaged) networkswitch that connects the NAS to the backup VLAN. When the copyjob is done, the network switch is turned off again. Do you guys know of network connected powerswitches that can be controlled by a script, or command?
 Thanks in advance!

 We’re looking to improve our security posture and standards. I came across Perview templates but couldn’t understand how they are licensed. Can anyone provide insite? We have business premium licenses.

 We have some strange behavior from google DNS when I interogate .net domains.
 dig .net @8.8.8.8 - no response
 but 
 dig +trace .net @8.8.8.8 - I get full respose
 Also I get error when I use https://dns.google/
 { &quot;Status&quot;: 2 /* SERVFAIL /, &quot;TC&quot;: false, &quot;RD&quot;: true, &quot;RA&quot;: true, &quot;AD&quot;: false, &quot;CD&quot;: false, &quot;Question&quot;: [ { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;avimag.net.&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: 1 / A */ } ] }
 I only on my side?
 Thanks

 Do I wait? Or could anyone give me insights?

 Suppose you have vlan 10 and with that an SVI of 192.168.10.1/24 that lives on Switch A. 
 If you had a trunk between switch A and switch B, there&#x27;s NO reason to have an SVI also on vlan 10 on switch B, right?

 I&#x27;m a bit stuck in terms of how to go about this in the best way, what is the most realistic and scalable way of doing it.
 I have a &quot;catch-all block-all-url security profile&quot; at the bottom that blocks everything that isn&#x27;t matched and i have made custom URL category lists for different websites that servers will need access to. I&#x27;m in the mindset that i won&#x27;t need to know EVERY background URL on a website, since servers won&#x27;t actaully be accessing the webpages, more than likely pull things down from the sites or making API calls etc..

                              <span>I work in install and repair and I occasionally do bigger residential houses with multiple lines. I normally will go around with all my tools and terminate all the lines at once. Once that is done I will use my tone box and one by one find out which lines are which at the modem. Terminate and label them. Then I do a lap with my laptop to test all the wire runs and patch cords. Is there a tool like my tone box/wand that can tone multiple lines? It would also be nice if that tool could also pair test too.

                              <span>I have a router (MX80 18.2R3-S1.7) with VPLS. Two local interfaces are connected to this VPLS (xe-0/0/3.600, ge-1/1/8.600). Two switches are connected to these interfaces (with identical uplink configurations). The problem is that I see different MAC addresses on the two different interfaces (most of them match, but there are also unique ones). Why could this be happening? In the &quot;show vpls mac-table&quot; output, I can see all MAC addresses, but the individual MAC addresses are missing on the switches connected

                              <span>Let&#x27;s say i have 2 router edges (Router A and Router B) that&#x27;s connected through BGP peering to different internet exchanges. Router A is connected to IX1 and Router B is connected to IX2. For some reason, i want to use GRE Tunnel on Router A to an upstream that&#x27;s only available on IX2. Do i only need to connect Router A and Router B, like with VLAN, and that&#x27;s it?
 NB: I&#x27;m a new NOC hire in a small datacenter and i&#x27;m trying to get to know things, so bear with me if i ask dumb questions lol.

                              <span>If you had a basic Layer 2 leading up to an Aggregate Switch that would then pass the traffic to a FW. Should you set up the Aggregate SW to be Layer 2 or 3? DHCP and services would be running on FW as well. I can see benefits for both but was curious what others opinions were.

 What I am trying to understand is:
  
Client initiates a SSH connection but does the client use server&#x27;s credentials to login?
 If so, is the server&#x27;s credential supposed to be hardcoded on the client and where so? some config XML file?

                              <span>Hi, I work for an ISP and I&#x27;m facing an issue which could be easily solved by implementing bgp between my customer cpe and my bras. 
 To give HA to my customers tho, I&#x27;m using an anycast ip address to terminate customers pppoe, with cisco load balancing method and without bgp peering all is working fairly good (aside from this crappy issue I&#x27;m facing, which is a particular specific scenario, and won&#x27;t bother you with details, those doesn&#x27;t matter for the sake of this thread)
 I&#x27;d like to give via radius some attributes to my bras so it establish a dynamic bgp peering with cpe, do any of you have ever used something like this? What I&#x27;m scared of is which ip address to use on bras side to establish the bgp peering
 Thanks in advance and have a nice weekend!

 I need to connect to a 10Gb Arista switch. I&#x27;m going to buy a NIC and I need a low latency NIC. I&#x27;ll buy the card from Supermicro AOC-A25G-m2SM . I couldn&#x27;t find any information regarding that NIC can work with SFP+ or not.
 I saw that generally SFP28 NIC can be used with SFP+ but I want to make sure about that before ordering the NIC.
 Can I use Mellanox ConnectX-6 Lx with SFP+?
 Thanks in advance.

 Is only having a L3 switch simplify the deployment complexity? Or having a firewall in front of all equipment more secure/safe?

 Just looking for some video resources on Windows Sysinternals Tools! Specifically providing a summary on all the tools available within the suite, along with a tutorial on how to use them in Production. I’m mainly looking to use this suite to aid me in conducting Malware Analysis.
 Anything you can share would be much appreciated!

                              <span>I have been following discussions on whether organizations should use cloud storage/compute or run their services locally. There seems to NOT be a clear winner between these two solutions, in terms of costs, reliability, uptime, security, management, scalability, capex vs opex, time savings, use cases etc.
 What’s your take on this? Are there specific business use cases that CANNOT be moved to cloud compute?

 What it is like for someone who say has 20+ years of experience, is local and not looking for 100% remote, has a BSCS, grinds LeetCode Medium/Hards daily, and has been continuously employed with the same company for more than 5 years?

                              <span>When I left my previous job they were sad. The manager said &quot;Hey the door is always open.&quot; But I figure that is just something they say to be nice.
 This was only two months ago. In two months at this new place I&#x27;ve gotten paid much better but I&#x27;m just like... drowning in old technology. The company is literally 15 years behind in tech and I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;ll go anywhere. I&#x27;m way more stressed. Management brings up my &quot;Time tracker&quot; at least 3 times a week (I&#x27;m salary). Not to mention the people are much less fun.
 I saw my old company posted a job similar to what I was doing... How pathetic would it be for me to reach out to my old manager and ask about it? Feels like crawling back after failing. I feel like I&#x27;m job hopping almost now.

                              <span>Like many people currently, I just moved a handful of domains away from Google Domains. As expected, all domain transfers added one year to the expiration, except one.
 This one domain was &quot;auto renewed&quot; at Google domains just over a week before being transferred. The transfer did not add a year to the expiration. I asked the new registrar what happened and they said the domain was in the auto-renewal grace period, which occurs after a domain has expired. I thought there&#x27;s no way, Google auto renewed the domain, how could it have expired?
 So I started looking at my Google domain transactions. If the transaction dates are anything to go by, the domain was originally purchased at X time. The &quot;auto renew&quot; transaction happened one year later on the same date, but at X + just under two hours. So it appears Google domains let this domain expire for almost two hours before the &quot;auto renew&quot; took place. This put the domain into the grace period which means when I transferred it, no additional year was added.
 Again, this is what appears to have happened. Going off of transaction times and the fact that the transfer didn&#x27;t add a year to the expiration. Google domains says the auto renew feature is supposed to renew a domain within a month before expiration. It seems like they didn&#x27;t and cost me a year&#x27;s worth of registration. Not a lot of money, but what bothers me more is thinking my domain may not have been working, which I use mainly for email, for almost two hours before the auto renew happened. And I probably wouldn&#x27;t have noticed if I didn&#x27;t transfer it.
 If anyone from Google domains is here, you owe me $12.

                              <span>Hi guys, 
 I have a client with a very strange issue with a local HP Laserjet Pro M404n printer. The prints do not come out even though the printer is redirected from the local PC to the AVD session. 
 However, if I were to redirect the printer back to the local desktop, the prints come through just fine. 
 Notes: 1. Both the local desktop and AVD recognize the printer. 2. The printer is plugged in through USB-A, so no wireless or networking is configured. 3. I checked the RDP settings in the host pool and printer redirection is enabled. 4. Tried doing a restart of the AVD and reinstalling the AVD client. 5. There&#x27;s no error messages that appear on the AVD 6. Printer can print just fine on the local desktop with no issues and HP Smart is installed 7. Tried installing the HP Print drivers in the AVD but it says the OS isn&#x27;t compatible even though it&#x27;s Windows 10 64 bit but I&#x27;m guessing it&#x27;s because it&#x27;s shared computer license.
 What else can I try or look for?

 If Intune, MBAM or third-party tools are not available, what methods are available to rotate the key? Decrypt and re-encrypt?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve seen throughout this sub many people reference Defender for Endpoint, and as someone who is currently using Sophos, our subscription is up in November and I want to evaluate DFE MDE.
 I have a dev tenant already set up, I imaged a spare laptop and joined it to my Azure AD and enrolled it in Intune. 
 I started a trial for DFE MDE and I tried setting up a configuration profile via Intune to enroll my client in DFE MDE. The configuration profile marks as successful, but in the security admin center under device inventory I don&#x27;t currently see any devices listed in there. I have created some AV policies but AFAIK they are not working (for example I tried to disable the user from being able to open defender settings, and currently I can still override my AV settings just by going through the Windows Defender security settings).
 I downloaded and ran some well known malware (mimikatz) and was able to launch and run commands in mimikatz. About 5 mins of the computer sitting idle, I heard a few notifications come in saying &quot;Enterprise unwanted application found&quot; and indicates it deleted the threats. 
 I&#x27;m fairly confused, clearly that doesn&#x27;t seem right. I re-enrolled the device a second time using the local script .cmd approach however I still don&#x27;t see any devices listed in the M365 Defender/security admin portal. There is no indicator on the client that DFE MDE has been installed (does it need to be &quot;installed&quot; per se or just enrolled?)
 Obviously being able to launch and run commands in mimikatz was only possible because I disabled the real time protection and clicked past many warnings, but still something doesn&#x27;t seem right there. Is DFE MDE just a centralized location for admins to manipulate built in Windows Defender settings? I&#x27;m a little confused currently.
 Sorry if these are stupid questions.

                              <span>I wanted to see if anyone had any experience tracking assets in a large building with RFID. I have a little experience with active RFID but the ones I used were rather large. 
 Does anyone have any thoughts on a small RFID tag that could be placed on computers or thin clients. 
 Are there any USB powered active RFID tags out there?

                              <span>So I&#x27;ve been looking at site24x7 as a possible contender for a network and infrastructure monitoring solution for our organization. I did a demo with their engineer and the product looks pretty good. Pricing isn&#x27;t terrible but the one big issue I have is the snmp polling interval.
 All of their product information talks about 1 minute polling, but apparently their on premise poller for snmp monitoring only does 5 minute polling? They keep side stepping the issue saying they still do up/down monitoring every minute, but statistics like in/out bandwidth is only collected once every 5 minutes.
 Is this correct? If so, for anyone else that uses site24x7 and has their on premise poller, have you had issues with the granularity only being 5 minutes?

                              <span>Some Background, I do some volunteer work for a church I used to go to and they have an old bare metal Windows 2016 server running AD, Quickbooks, and a file share. I&#x27;ve been trying to think through options for when this thing either dies or goes EOL and I remembered clients at my previous MSP job running AAD with no on-prem DC and was wondering what drawbacks exist for this configuration? Some notes:
 -The church has E3 365 licenses already.
 -The only apps they use are the Quickbooks installed on the server and 365 apps locally.
 -Ideally they would get an MSP to help them but the church has very little money.
 I want to make the environment as maintenance free as possible, as going onsite is a full day trip. Any suggestions or ideas are greatly appreciated!
 EDIT: Thanks for all the reply’s and advice. At the end of the day there’s only about 5 users and only 2 of them are full time so any solution will likely work well enough. Setting up AD was probably overkill but it was setup years ago and I don’t want to reinvent the entire network if I don’t have to. My biggest goal is just to get them following as many best practices as they can.

                              <span>This company i started working like 15 days ago have a cobol software for all their operations with windows xp, with win server 03 and we are starting to migrate to windows 11 and win server 22, the monday and i try to recover the &quot;deleted&quot; files except for two missing ones in recuva shows that the 2 missing files are not to be found on disk and they were moved managed to restore all but those files was i sabotaged ? the previous it guy the tuesday shows to save the day but i cant recover those files. and he never make a backup of the files but i taking all the blame in this situation what i should do? keep going with the migration or just step aside.
 the files that were deleted holds inventory information and the vat book. that is recoverable but would take like one month to recover. Edit 1: the cobol software isnt running on a mainframe its just an emulator on windows xp 7 and some windows 10 it was develop circa 2001. The previous IT guy did some backups and are dated from 2022. Yes is two &quot;servers&quot; one for each company in the same building for the same owners the server room has a network rack no ac no ups. They have in a server the running the same software for two divisions of the company and one more for avoiding vat this is one of the biggest hardware store and construccion in the state. Yes is a shame that such a big company doing shady stuff but third world country an hpe dl380 gen10+ cost for us 8000 usd
 Also english is not my mother languaje but i do me best to write as clear as i can
 Edit 2: we have serious suspects that the previous IT in revenge delete all the database because they didnt renew his contract and we re the new ones

                              <span>Currently we are using Endpoint Central as our Endpoint Management Tool it works fine for patch management but the some features sometimes not working as expected. I am tasked to look for an alternative solution for Endpoint Central. I have experienced with SCCM of Microsoft but my boss want me to have a matrix comparison of Microsoft, IBM and VMWare.
 Do IBM and VMWare has this kind of Endpoint Managrment tool as well? just hoping maybe some sysadmin are using this kind of tools from IBM and VMWare as im not sure if they have.

                              <span>Hello everyone, I am trying to understand what would put my company and me at risk, and what I can and cannot do. I probably cannot just ask them, as the company is old-school and they&#x27;d prefer me just sitting idlely for an hour even though I have nothing to do.
 Our setup is as follows, Azure Active Directory, every machine is a Windows, all connected on the same internal network that you have to 2FA into your machine. All of the network is monitored and goes through a proxy. We also have laptop window machines that work on the same active directory account and if you want to access your work station inside the office from home, you have to use their VPN and then Remote Desktop into it. This all works great, and while I am not a Windows user myself, I am really pleased as to how nice the experience is, considering the heavy emphasis on safety.
 Now to my question, to what extent can my employer track me? My main questions are about the laptop, when it&#x27;s not connected to their network/ VPN, is there anything inside the laptop/ windows that is tracking what I am doing? Do I have to cover my camera? I am mostly asking because after finishing my work for the day and I am at the office, I usually have an hour or so to kill before I can go home, and I would like to Remote Desktop/ SSH into my home machine and continue working on my own stuff, but I am not sure if these can be tracked and if I would alert someone like I am doing something shady. 
 Basically I would like to access my own machine from the work laptop without causing problems for anyone.

If I had known I would need to pay extra for more cores I would have gone with a lower core count CPU. I have a 2.8 Ghz Xeon Platinum 8362 with 32 cores. I Initially wanted a Server Standard 2022 License but I am researching that I would need to get more licensing for cores? How does this work. I have used the various core calculators but my pricing is running to 10K for just the Standard edition. What is going on here

I have searched several MDM solutions and while having great functionality (perhaps more than needed) and all of them that I have found forces me to buy a minimum of 10/25 licenses. I only need one. Does any one know of a solution, either in 3rd party apps, or native android or Samsung? Up to 30$/year would be reasonable.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi, I&#x27;m starting my own business but honestly I don&#x27;t know if it will work at all and if my product will sell well. That&#x27;s why my resources are limited.
 I wanted to buy Intel nuc 13 pro with i7-1360P processor + 64GB ram. When I compare the specs, this computer has really great specs even compared to older large rack servers. But this computer defaults to home use and not as a server.
 Does it make sense to buy this computer as a 24/7 server to host my online store? In fact, it will be just one Ubuntu system or virtualization with two systems. The website will be made mainly in PHP + mysql. My main concerns are the inability to use ecc memory and the processor, although its parameters are impressive 12-cores 16-threads maybe it&#x27;s not a processor that can handle the load generated by hundreds of users on a website so well?
 Unfortunately I don&#x27;t have room for a bigger server at home - rack servers are very noisy and smaller ones like the proliant micorserver are still quite big. An additional advantage of nuc is practically zero power consumption during idle

                              <span>I was frustrated last week with various tickets along the lines of &quot;Microphone doesn&#x27;t work&quot; and no more information. 
 This morning it occurred to me I could use Bing AI to help, so I thought about adding a field in our ticketing system that concatenates &quot;You are an IT support engineer. Please compose an answer that is sympathetic, friendly, helpful and concise to the following problem reported to you by a user:&quot; along with the complaint from the ticket.
 The idea is if the incoming ticket is too vague, the technician can just copy and paste the contents of that field in Bing chat to get the basis for their reply, making minor customizations to personalize the reply depending on the circumstances. 
 Thoughts? Suggestions for how I can improve this?

                              <span>I honestly don&#x27;t care the effectiveness of SmartScreen.
 I just want to let the warning sign on Windows Security icon in system tray gone forever, so my users will not bother me with &quot;what has happened with Windows Security&quot; tickets.
 https://i.imgur.com/sjhc0NY.png
 ​
 This is what I have tried:
 First, turn on &quot;Smart SmartScreen for Microsoft Edge&quot;. This can be made possible by enable two GPO entries:
 Computer Confirguations &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Windows Defender SmartScreen &gt; Microsoft Edge &gt; Configure Windows Defender SmartScreen
 Computer Confirguations &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Microsoft Edge &gt; SmartScreen settings &gt; Configure Microsoft Defender SmartScreen (need Microsoft Edge policy templates file to work, or use Registry)
 Next, try to turn on &quot;Potentially unwanted app blocking&quot;.
 I only find what enables &quot;Block downloads&quot;:
 Computer Confirguations &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Microsoft Edge &gt; SmartScreen settings &gt; Configure Microsoft Defender SmartScreen to block potentially unwanted apps
 I also have tried to enable this:
 Computer Confirguations &gt; Administrative Templates &gt; Windows Components &gt; Microsoft Defender Antivirus &gt; Configure detection for potentially unwanted applications , but this alone can&#x27;t turn &quot;block apps&quot; on.
 ​
 So this is what the Windows Security looks like after I done all of things above:
 https://i.imgur.com/pfYIrLN.png
 ​
 I saw others turned &quot;block apps&quot; on but struggle to figure out turing &quot;Block downloads&quot; on:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/Intune/comments/o0a65w/enable_potentially_unwanted_apps/
 But this guy did not say anything about how they turn &quot;block apps&quot; on.
 ​
 So has anyone ever tried to fix the system tray icon of Windows Security, and successfully turn the PUA completely on? Typing admin passwords on 100+ PCs at my location does not seems to be a sane solution that a sysadmin will pick.

                              <span>My gosh, our sales manager approached IT to ask if we could get a new iphone for one of the three new hires, as the two other new hires received new ones and he received a used device. We explained him that the process is to issue devices that we have in stock first, unless there is a very good (e.g. medical) reason why a different device should be used. He didn&#x27;t like that and went on and complained that this wouldn&#x27;t be fair etc. Being in charge,I looked him in the eyes and asked what was wrong with the device, as it was in a technical fine condition and it had been cleaned well by my colleague before it was handed over; Of course he didn&#x27;t have an answer, but still more or less demanded to get a new phone ordered. After telling him that we just stuck to a totally common process and that he would have to get those changed, he went away and hasn&#x27;t been seen again that day (turned out he went to hr to ask for a change of the process and this eventually went all the way up). We are by far no huge company where something like this might be typical, but even if, just feeling this entitlement from sales all the time (I could fill pages with examples of them causing issues and collateral damage everywhere) in combination with such a pointless, unjustified, wasteful demand almost made me respond in a rather unprofessional way (my answers might have been emotional here and there,but professional).
 Is it just me or have some people just lost touch of what makes someone a successful worker?

                              <span>I am looking to deploy 20-30 Aruba AP-315 over POE to form a single strong wifi network across a building. Is there some advantage to deploying them in Instant mode compared to Campus mode? Seems like people here always talk about Instant mode but that then requires flashing every AP since AP hardware seems to be cheaper on eBay than IAP. Seems like added work compared to plugging all into a compatible switch. 
 And if I wanted to run Campus mode is there some cheap aruba switch I can buy on eBay that can control all of these APs without needing to buy special licenses? For example could I use a 48port s3500 to connect all of the access points, or would I need a separate controller?
 Trying to figure out the cheapest and simplest way to do this.

                              <span>Hi everyone, we have a velo which has a probable hardware failure since both our wan links is not being detected.
  
We like try to reset first the velo. Does doing a hard/soft reset changes the configuration on the orchestrator? or it only affects the edge device and when the edge device finally reboots would automatically import the configurations on the orchestrator? Or should we just do a complete reactiviation? How does each actions affevt tje edge and config from the orchestrator?
 
Does Reactivation automatically sends the software version and config to the new velo? What things should I look for after doing a reactivation?

                              <span>Got brought into a use case where an end user needs to VPN into Azure, and then that azure subscription/resources also Site 2 Site IPSEC VPN&#x27;s over to another location that has a machine the end user is trying to reach. When I came into this effort to help a buddy, it was setup already using native Azure VPN gateway/etc.... there&#x27;s also an Azure Firewall but it&#x27;s not doing much currently. So the main issue is the distant end with the server wants the client to only come across the VPN using one public IP.... here&#x27;s the fun part... for Azure VPN DHCP Pools it has to be a /29 or greater... so I can&#x27;t just issue the client one public and call it a day. Additionally, the S2S VPN is using policy based traffic selectors and as such I can&#x27;t also turn on NAT to turn a private pool into one &quot;port overloaded&quot; public IP. I also apparently can&#x27;t just slap a NAT Gateway in there because when I attach a private subnet to it, and try to use that same subnet for VPN pool addresses, it throws overlap errors.
 ​
 So I guess in summary..... what is the right design strategy for this situation given the technical limitations (oh and they can&#x27;t change their end until the next change window next week if we need to try anything, so we&#x27;re just trying to figure out what we can do from our Azure end for now, if anything).
 ​
 Part of me thinks I should just slap a Palo VM on there, do globalprotect and a site 2 site and let the palo take care of NAT without complaining like Azure has been at me, but palo&#x27;s are like $6k a month in azure, and part of me wonders if I should be using azure&#x27;s native firewall in the mix in some way to help the situation or if I&#x27;m not using other native features correctly enough to get this straight.
 ​
 Any advice is appreciated, sorry for the wall of text, and RIP my favorite 3rd party reddit app soon &#x3D;[

                              <span>I’ve been using Catalyst switches and Aironet APs forever.
 Management SW has never been amazing but we don’t use it much. Making the move from Prime to DNAC at the moment mostly just for reports and assurance. 
 Of course licensing sucks and issues pop up but the HW is overall really stable and reliable.
 But now it feels like Cisco is trying to push us all to Meraki everything now and I’m a little worried. Never used Meraki before.
 Anybody have experience making the transition?

                              <span>I&#x27;m curious what others think. There seems to be two camps: one that says separate your 2.4GHz and 5GHz SSIDs, and the other that says (if its available in your platform) leverage band steering to force capable clients to the 5GHz spectrum.
 We&#x27;re slowly converting some ANCIENT Wi-Fi deployments to Meraki and trying to clean up various Wi-Fi-related problems in our environment, like rogue networks (thanks, HP printers!) and such. Meraki is naturally all about their band steering, but when we work with tools like Ekahau, they preach separate SSIDs per band. Part of me also feels that while band steering might work &#x27;most of the time,&#x27; there still might be some random issues that may crop up.
 What have you found works best, especially in large/multi-story deployments and/or using Meraki?

I am trying to ping the IPv6 link local address from a guest on host A to a guest on host B and it is failing. Is there something I have to do in addition to get IPv6 working? I can ping one to the other over IPv4 on the other interfaces which are part of another VLAN.

 Just curious if anybody has run into this previously, as it startled me when I first encountered it, and is rapidly becoming a major issue for my organization.

 We have Aruba (2530 series generally) as our core switches (18&#x27;ish) - and the oldest are soon to be replaced with Aruba CX-6100 series switches. There are 10 VLANs in place, with a few extra for very small needs.
 Sometimes we have need, where new cable runs aren&#x27;t feasible, to add access switches. For these &#x27;access switches&#x27;, we had been using low-end Netgear, TP-Link etc as it was expedient and we weren&#x27;t experiencing any issues, nor were we actively monitoring the switches (no issue contributes to low priority).
 Troubleshooting/contributing factors to question
 However, I started to try and put in better equipment and noted Zyxel had very functionality (SNMP, good CLI, etc) and have since noticed strange issues. We started with 2 of these, and I had LoopGuard enabled - within…</span>

                              <span>I currently have FortiManager deployed (at this point, we are still using it basically to maintain firmware and nothing more) and hundreds of Fortigate firewalls in the field.
 I am evaluating several SD-WAN solutions (I know, this is poorly defined) basically replacing the firewalls with bridge devices that build a software defined network back to a gateway and egress internet from that gateway (Ala Velocloud). In this scenario, the clients provider IPs are decoupled from the egress IP that traffic comes from. (We have several clients that utilize whitelisted only services, so ISP failovers or replacements are challenging)
 I am looking to utilize client managed circuits, not a fully managed SD-WAN where they want to define the circuits, install new circuits, add MPLS, etc..
 ​
 Is this what Fortinet&#x27;s offering is? It seems their SD-WAN information that I had found was leveraging the central management capabilities of Fortimanager, but still requiring the purchase and licensing of a fortigate firewall at each site. This seems more like &quot;centralized configuration&quot; than SD-WAN, so egress traffic still changes IPs and such when circuits fail, etc.

 It sounds like we are dead in the water. Does anyone know off-hand if migrating to Duo Mobile ASA SSL VPN using Duo Single Sign-On requires the DLTSV1.2 connectivity support? We are currently using Duo LDAPS integration with SSL VPN.

                              <span>Hi all,
 Looking into an issue where we are seeing long authentication times sporadically for certain users. (20~ seconds)
 After analysing packets on client, AP and in DC, it appears the delay is happening on the windows clients (we only have windows clients) In windows event logs there is a significant delay that matches the packet capture.
 After the windows clients receive the server hello, along with certs, server key exchange and cert request, it does not respond for 20 seconds, in this time the AP retransmits the last packet 3 times before client responds.
 This is a common occurrence for some, and rare for others, there are different generations of laptops in the company however we don’t see any correlation there.
 Has anyone experienced this before, I can’t find anything! Are there any windows logs anyone can recommend to narrow down our investigation?

 Can someone please explain the difference between Template and Template Stack in Panorama with some examples if that&#x27;s OK?
 I&#x27;ve read Palo Alto documentation about them but I still don&#x27;t get it 😕 
 Thanks

                              <span>I&#x27;m trying to figure out how to best setup a wireless mesh network network that utilizes multiple gateways in order to minimize the amount of hops needed to reach WAN.
 Say we have a very long linear mesh (bunch of nodes on a string) in a tunnel. For each hop we loose some throughput, so if we only have one router as the gateway at say one of the ends, at the other end we will have much decreased performance. I could setup the mesh such that the nodes at the first third will use router A as the gateway, the next third uses router B and the last third uses router C. This works fine, except we of course get dropped connections every time we roam from one third to another and the routers don&#x27;t act as a failover for each other. Additionally, the roaming is slower when effectively switching between networks.
 One topology I&#x27;ve thought about it having each of routers A,B and C use another fourth router D as their gateway such that then at least at the connections come from the same place and then perhaps it would be possible to perhaps have a stable phone call throughout the tunnel when roaming.
 Problem is that I&#x27;m frankly a little too green to figure this out entirely on my own. I guess what I&#x27;m looking for is called multi-WAN or multi-home? What sort of topology and/or setups would you use in this situation?

                              <span>Hi,
 On my infra, we switched to simple network access to link aggregates (bonding) and vlan trunking on the bond interfaces, I mean server side. 
 Nothing exotic. But since then we noticed with wireshark a lot of TCP issues : out of order, dup ack and retransmission 
 I first thought that routing was messy but I tested with tcp traceroute everywhere and I saw nothing wrong.
 I thought about MTU but it seems ok (tested with ping with 1500 size and no fragmentation).
 I’m not a networking guy, I work on a bare metal kubernetes infra. The networking team says that there is nothing wrong on switches/routers at first sight. 
 These errors appears even on same LAN connections. 
 Where would you look at to debug this ?

                              <span>Testing setup:
 Windows AD Ubuntu 20.04 client joined to domain via SSSD. Horizon view connection to client with smart card passthrough.
 Client sees smartcard, able to do all auth with pam_pkcs11 right now but trying to swap to SSSD.
 Right now the cert on our cards is issued by different federal agency. But I can grab the Serial # and subject strings and toss into AltSecIdentities field in my AD.
 UID on my domain matches UID on the card. 
 When I toss pam_sss.so into sudo and attempt to auth I&#x27;m seeing p11_child looking through my certs on the card but never actually matching anything. Eventually the sudo attempt shows &quot;please enter smart card&quot; and then drops to ask to password after p11 gives up.
 My pam_pkcs11 config just has a mapper to look at the UID on the card, see it&#x27;s joeschmoo and match that to my domain user joeschmoo.
 SSSD seems unable to do this and not sure what I&#x27;m missing now.
 (Not at laptop currently but will upload config once I get back. Very basic config though with just pam_cert_auth set to true and pam DB pointing at sssd_ca_db.pem)

                              <span>maybe once a year, i take a look at moving away from our current patching solution: WSUS as our single repo to reduce WAN usage; BatchPatch for manually performing prepatch operations (stopping our in-house middleware services) and initiating the download/install/reboot cycle; PRTG for server health monitoring/alerts to on-call, alerts which need to be acknowledged or ignored during the patch window so as not to fire off PagerDuty calls.
 so far, i haven&#x27;t found anything that feels like a worthwhile upgrade/replacement. i think the main things working against my search are these:
  
we need to issue a &quot;Stop-Service -Name MiddleWareApp&quot; to ensure connections to the servers are stopped and drained before beginning patch installation
 we need to manually acknowledge all the server alarms that follow (CPU usage &gt; 95%; host not pinging during the post-patch reboot; etc.)
  
we&#x27;ve been using PRTG for many years and we do like that it supports fully agent-less monitoring of essentially ALL the things we care about. WMI for Windows, SNMP for Linux/appliances, and so on. but, it feels very, very stuck in the past. like, it&#x27;s 2023 and they still do not support recurring maintenance window scheduling, or rules like &quot;only alert if the alarm threshold has been exceeded for X scan intervals&quot;. maddening.
 the handful of other products i&#x27;ve tried -- PDQdeploy, ManageEngine Patch Manager, Automox, Level dot io -- do not (at the time i tested each one) support pre- or post-patch scripting, e.g., stop the specified service and wait for the process to terminate before beginning patching. naturally, i&#x27;m tired of doing it manually in BatchPatch but i just haven&#x27;t found a solid replacement yet.
 i have about 140 Windows servers (98% VM&#x27;s) that i need to deal with.
 please give me recommendations on products and/or process improvements that you&#x27;ve found to make this task easier. thanks!

 Do all levels of admins do that (domain admin vs. just admin access to specific servers)?
 Do you have a naming convention you like? Regular account: HJS and an HJS_Admin?
 Do you use a product to manage this?

                              <span>This is mostly a rant, but any words of advice or encouragement are appreciated. Due to a number of complex reasons, I can not just leave this place, so that&#x27;s out of the question. This will be a long one.
 I have to be working with what must be the most incompetent manager, let alone IT professional, I have ever encountered. He is the director of IT at the SMB I work for. He originally ran an MSP for years before the company decided to bring him on as Director of IT since he was at their office every day as it stood.
 I started about a year ago, hired into a senior role in charge of infrastructure and security as well as building out a helpdesk to pass off to an eventual end user support manager. Prior to this, he had no management experience other than a summer intern, so this was a two …</span>

                              <span>Are there any existing or prior or current Arctic Wolf Clients here who can answer a few questions about their services?
 1. Do they have actual people/SOC analysts (human in-the-loop) reviewing detections from integrated tools?
 2. Do they perform human-led threat hunts, or is it all automated?
 3. Do they open actionable tickets resulting from threat hunts, whether automated or human-led?

                              <span>Today my manager, who is the assistant director of IT, offered me a position as a junior cybersecurity analyst. I work in small-medium grocery store company in the helpdesk and the company currently does not have anyone working in a security role so they are looking for someone internally to possibly fulfill that position in a junior role.
 I feel like I should jump at the role immediately as it&#x27;s a significant promotion but to be completely honest I&#x27;m just not sure if I want to go into the security route. I&#x27;m still attending school as a computer science major and only have one semester left for this fall to graduate. I&#x27;ve been leaning more towards doing something in web development instead, however, I also feel like I may be throwing away a huge opportunity to get a job right away while still in my last semester and not deal with the stress of looking for a job after graduating with little experience. I&#x27;m thinking of taking the job, gaining the experience, and if I still feel like I&#x27;d rather do web development jump into that after a year of doing security.
 Would it be wise to just take the opportunity and see what happens? Or should I only accept the role if I feel I have a future in security? I don&#x27;t want to screw the company or myself over for the future. I&#x27;m definitely open and willing to try out a new field and do what is necessary to do well in the position but am unsure if I&#x27;m making the right decision. I appreciate any advice you guys can offer.

                              <span>We were using a product called Workspace made by Stoneware. It allowed users to access data on shares that they have access to. So for example, when they were on-prem and logged into a machine, they would automatically have a &quot;T:&quot; drive assigned for whatever. This product allowed them to see all the stuff in their &quot;T:&quot; drive in a webpage and they&#x27;d have to download and upload the files via a somewhat clunky interface. It wasn&#x27;t ideal, but it worked.
 Well apparently they&#x27;ve up and pulled the plug on this product so we&#x27;re scrambling for a replacement. Does anyone have any recommendations? The only real wants/requirements are:
  
SAML compatible so we can SSO
 Ease of use (the last one&#x27;s interface was blech)
 Web-based would be great
  
We have a Palo Alto firewall and are currently allowing people to VPN in for this, but that&#x27;s cumbersome for lots of our users. Does anyone have any suggestions for allowing our users to access their files when off-prem? An aspect of the PA or a backend product - any suggestions appreciated.
 Thanks!

                              <span>I got a call on my Teams number and normally with no caller ID (ie. number only) I don&#x27;t answer, but then I took a second look. It was one of our company&#x27;s own DIDs. So just because I know scammers will spoof numbers close to yours I let it finish. Then the same number rang my mobile. So I answered it. It was some rep from RingCentral saying he had spoken to me before. I have zero recollection of that and told him we are on Teams with an EA and local telco for Direct Routing so we&#x27;re not interested and hung up. 
 The fact that a somewhat reputable company is spoofing numbers looks really bad if not illegal. I wouldn&#x27;t consider them for my business now because of this. I&#x27;m in Canada so really not sure what the rules are. I hate sales people. I don&#x27;t understand how this could be allowed.

 First of all, thank you for just reading. I&#x27;m not a IT guy but know a little bit. 
 With my family we are starting a company (at the moment 6 workers). Right now each one of us save their documents in their own computer, so when someone needs a document other person has it has to be sent by mail (I know, it&#x27;s a disaster). We have a limited budget. I was reading that the best option could be a NAS server with RAID. The brand I mostly hear is Synology. We use W7, W10 and MacOs. Wich server do you recommend me for our needs? We need to have remote access in case we are not in the office btw.
 Thanks in advance for any advice :)
 Edit:
 Thank you all for your advices. Many has suggested using cloud. However I had a bad experience with OneDrive (lost information). For me there are three advantages of not using cloud. 1 You only pay once/not monthly payment (as far as I know, so in long term is cheaper) 2 can use your files even if there&#x27;s not internet 3 easier to make backups.
 However I will be open minded

 So I am wondering what&#x27;s the best method to consider, do I setup the drives in SHR-2 or RAID 6? And what about the SSD as a cache drive? 
 Thanks,

                              <span>I started recently quarantining emails that return a hard fail for an SPF lookup. One thing I&#x27;m curious about is I&#x27;ve seen a few domains that are failing because their spf2.0 (SIDF) record doesn&#x27;t include all their sending networks. However, they have an SPF record that has the sending network IP listed that would allow the message. Shouldn&#x27;t those two records be set the same and they just messed up? Or am I the cause of the problem by having my system care about SIDF and I just need to set it to check SPF?

                              <span>Not sure if there is someone that can point me in the right direction. Doing a costing exercise (so this may all come to nothing). Is there an open source and/or free licensing SBC that is compatible with Teams? Started going through them, and so far the best one seems to be ultratel, however, it would potentially be better (and cheaper) for our own to be hosted. 
 The idea is to cost savings on telephony, while keeping scalability for the predicted growth. The current vendor is pretty competitive, but, as with growth we have already had, I think we can drive down cost per user without impacting performance.

                              <span>Hi there,
 I would like to change the sharepoint domain name to another one. 
 Example:
 companyB.sharepoint.com(companyA.sharepoint.com to companyB.sharepoint.com
 (both domains are active already in the administration portal) 
 I found some official documentation On how to do it.
 But I&#x27;m not aware of the potential impact on a running Microsoft 365 infrastructure.
 Would there be impact?
 Any tips?

Teams is installed with the same bitness as Outlook. These options exist on physical PCs. The known issues and limitations has nothing on this, unsure if not really a limitation or just not documented.
 Is anyone else experiencing this? Do we have a misconfig somewhere?

Their line remains stripped with the &quot;No information&quot; tag, even when I receive their &quot;Meeting accepted&quot; confirmation mail.
 Internal users are synced without any issue. 
 Is there something I have to allow somewhere ?

                              <span>A recommendation to you all in here - do a spoof test on https://emailspooftest.com
 This was my results - anyone know how to solve those that only got F grade? We use Microsoft Defender.
 Control test - valid email - Grade: A
 Fake subdomain protection - Enforced: Grade: A
 BEC fake insider protection - Enforced: Grade: A
 Look-a-like protection - Grade: F
 Domain attack protection - Grade: F
 Subdomain attack protection - Grade: F
 ​
 This is their explanation for the failures:
 E7:
 SPF is not enforced.
 Fix: Set email systems to reject email from servers that fail SPF checks.
 DNS Settings for badSPF.com
 DMARC &#x3D; Not configured (Neutral)
 SPF &#x3D; Reject all
 [v&#x3D;spf1 -all]
 DKIM &#x3D; email not signed (Selector &#x3D; default)
 [selector &#x3D; default, v&#x3D;DKIM1; k&#x3D;rsa; p&#x3D;MIIB...]
 E8:
 SPF reject all is not enforced for subdomains.
 Fix: Set email systems to reject email from servers that fail SPF checks.
 DNS Settings for badSPF.com
 DMARC &#x3D; Not configured (Neutral)
 SPF &#x3D; Reject all
 [v&#x3D;spf1 -all]

 E10:
 Reverse DNS is not enforced.
 Fix: On inbound email gateways, enable DNS lookups. Tip: If you host your own gateways make sure you have enough resources.

 About a month ago as I was coordinating the logistics of a computer roll out, a staff member at the site grabed her keychain and turned on the air conditioning using the key. I then learned that every Union member had a key as it was part of the bargaining agreement.
 The next day I went on Amazon and purchased a key for $6.99

 Same behavior when firewall and EDR are turned off. Opening UPS causes it to open and close instantly, tried reinstalls and different machines with same behavior. Master station works normally on same network.

I&#x27;m testing deployed this patch update to my test group which contain around 25 clients, all of these clients failed to update this patch then I check the status it shown event report as &quot;Error:Downloaded Failed&quot; and nothing else I have no idea what cause this 
 I&#x27;m not sure if this is the cause but my client&#x27;s network did packet shaping to limited the bandwidth in the network so it cause the update patch to failed to download

                              <span>Hey guys.
 We have a few Dell R720 servers with a PERC H710P Mini Raid controller. We bought a few Samsung 1643a SAS SSD drives that we would like to use to extend the life of these old servers a bit.
 When installing the drives, they were properly recognized, they show up in IDRAC. I set up a new Virtual Disk, configured the RAID array, did a fast initialization (as the drives were brand new), everything went smoothly.
 However, on reboot, it took a very long time for the server to start, and it stops at the PERC initialization with the message &quot;Adapter at Baseport is not responding. No adapter&quot; and fails to continue to boot.
 Removing the drives, the adapter is initialized and the machine boots.
 I also tried adding the drives while I was in the BIOS RAID utility, and it&#x27;s the same, as via IDRAC. The drives get recognized, RAID array configuration works, but upon reboot, it stops with the same error message.
 Before the error message pops up, the drives&#x27; LEDs blink slowly, sequentially (one after the other). After a few minutes, they all blink fast. I let it be for a few hours, but did not change the results.
 Here are some other things I tried already:
  
firmware/bios update - everything is up to date
 only connected 1/2/4/6 drives at a time
 removed other drives in the enclosure
 perform a full initialization of the raid array from the BIOS RAID utility
 opened up the server and checked the cables, battery, reseated the adapter
 used another identical server
  
Any idea of what might be wrong?
 Anyone else use this combo R720/H710P/1643a?
 Thanks a bunch!

                              <span>Small company &lt;20 users / M365 Business Premium + Intune and AIP
 I&#x27;m aware that services exist to deal with spam etc like Mimecast, Proofpoint. But for a small company like ours, it seems a bit OTT.
  
 The issue I have is the methods provided in the M365 estate either don&#x27;t seem to work very well or are patchy.
  
In transport rules I have tried specific email, targeted words, domain blocks etc
 In Configuration Analyser we are set to strict
 Anti- Phish/Spam/Malware all on + Safe Links and Attachments
  
All the usual things I guess are on or active.
 Even tried blocking within the Phish and Spam settings
 But stuff just seems to be able to evade it?
 If I set an alert for e.g. on an incoming email I have blocked I might get a couple, and then I find it in the quarantine again the next day.
  
 Currently, I have to view the quarantine every day and delete anything suspect. Even for a small company like us, it&#x27;s 100 a day +. But we find this is too quick for the users sometimes and stuff they need gets removed. 
 We did wonder if there is a script or something to delete them over &quot;x&quot; days to save my time going every day?
 We tell them to use the Block /Allow emails and add them to their contacts, but I doubt many do
  
 We did also wonder about allowing stuff to be active in the quarantine so they moderate and release their own stuff, dunno how safe that will be though.
  
 How are we actually supposed to keep this stuff out?
 I know everyone has a method, but what is the correct way to keep this stuff blocked?
 Or the correct sections to use that will help.
  
 Or is there no answer?

                              <span>Just a short Friday rant.
 Just got Our annual renewal of the maintenance of Our Cerberus FTP software (profesional edition). 
 I got notified that they had changed from regular 1 year renewal to 3 Year contracts (paid yearly). 
 Then i get the quota .. last year the renewal of same edition was 336$ for 1 Year, now it&#x27;s 999$ a Year
 &quot;3 Year Subscription — $999.00 Paid Annually &quot; and in checkout &quot;Renewal 3 Year Subscription, Price Per Year&quot;
 I&#x27;ve sent their sales team an email if this can be correct price for 1 year...
 the change from 1 year normal renewal to 3 year contract is pretty bad, but if the price jump is real...
 Cancel maintenance, let it run for a few months before i setup a new ftp server.
 Good weekend everybody!

 The two processes that needs the most ressources are the svchost.exe with netprofm and RPCSS.
 Had somebody the same problems and has it resolve?
 If we install a clean RDS2022 Host with the exact Software / GPOs which is not Member of the Session Collection everythins works without problems.
 Our RDS2016 RDS Host Server, which are members of the session collection run fine.

 Does anyone have any means of getting hold of sales there? For 3 weeks we&#x27;ve been calling and the phone never gets answered. You leave a vm and send emails and still notta thing. I initially spoke with some entry level sales person who took the query which was hugely simple pricing question and since its like the whole organisation doesnt exist!
 Its for £100K + order too, which isn&#x27;t the biggest I accept but it must mean something.
 Any tips please!? (before I lose my mind)

                              <span>There is a great deal of user-generated content out there, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos, but we&#x27;ve generally tried to keep that off of the front page due to the volume and as a result of community feedback. There&#x27;s also a great deal of content out there that violates our advertising/promotion rule, from scripts and software to tutorials and videos.
 We have received a number of requests for exemptions to the rule, and rather than allowing the front page to get consumed, we thought we&#x27;d try a weekly thread that allows for that kind of content. We don&#x27;t have a catchy name for it yet, so please let us know if you have any ideas!
 In this thread, feel free to show us your pet project, YouTube videos, blog posts, or whatever else you may have and share it with the community. Commercial advertisements, affiliate links, or links that appear to be monetization-grabs will still be removed.

                              <span>We are recently receiving numerous problems from users with HP laptops, that they can&#x27;t switch on their PC after disconnecting from docking station.
 Either the PC won&#x27;t turn on, or functionality is limited. The current solution to this is power resetting the PC every time. 
 Any idea if this is caused by a recent Windows/Firmware update?

                              <span>I&#x27;ve got an issue reported by a client, that has me completely stumped, and isn&#x27;t something myself, or the team has seen before.
 We have a Dell Latitude 5530 that had its motherboard replaced 2-3 months ago due to graphical issues when plugged into a dock (WD19S) - this is a somewhat ongoing issue but is separate.
 Starting today, the laptop has refused to power on unless it is plugged into a Dell Dock.The laptop doesn&#x27;t power on, or show any sign of life, when disconnected from all devices or plugged into a power adapter/charger.I&#x27;ve tried a few chargers that all work without issues on other devices, so it&#x27;s definitely not a charger issue.
 If you boot up the laptop whilst plugged into the dock, and then unplug, it works seamlessly, as if there were no issues at all. Restarting the device when unplugged is completely fine, it&#x27;s just shutting down/booting up
 Is this something anyone has experienced before, or has any basic troubleshooting steps I could look at as a starting point?
 Processor: 12th Gen Intel it-1245UBIOS Version: Dell 1.11.3
 Motherboard: Dell A00 (0CHX27)OS Version: Windows 10 Pro 10.0.19045 (22H2)
 All Drivers through Support Assist &amp; Windows Updates are fully up to date.

                              <span>We grew a bit over the past years and information security is rearing its head. We still got no events, but are aware that this mostly out of luck and not skill. We are already conducting an annual security training, will be implementing MFA for our accounts soon and started looking at phishing and social engineering testing campaigns.
 I remember reading about research comparing different information security tools, but my google fu is failing me and I get mostly corporate spam stuff. I remember seeing comparisons between training and training plus testing and how both combined are much more effective than either in their own. I did find a cambrige paper about cost-effectiveness across threat vectors and industries, but not about countermeasures.

 Higher ups are engineers mostly and data always works to prioritize the right approach, so I am currently looking for that right now.

                              <span>I am reaching out to seek your expertise and assistance with a task I&#x27;m currently working on. I have a text file containing log lines, and I need to scan these lines for specific destination IP addresses and extract certain fields from them.
 The IPs I want to scan the lines for are around 50, so I need to feed the script these 50 IP addresses as IP1, IP2, and so on.
 The field for destination IP is dst_ip in the log below and the same line has protocol, and dst_port fields.
 And then extract the fields highlighted below: dst_ip, protocol, and dst_port
 I would prefer if this can be done in CMD with a batch file on windows, as my experience with python scripting and so on is very beginner level, but I am open to try out suggestions.
 Here&#x27;s a log snippet:

 I tried various ways in notepad++ but could not meet these requirements, I believe this can be done much fasted in a batch script or python script.

                              <span>We recently migrated our on prem jedox server to their cloud service and users report daily errors like session timeouts in the middle of work or other cryptic error messages. 
 There is no clear explanation for the error on the part of the jedox support and as a sysadmin I am too far away to judge whether it is software or user error.
 But my feeling tells me that it is more about problems on the part of the software and its cloud infrastructure.
 Does anyone else use this software and are currently experiencing similar things?

                              <span>Hi,
 we are working in hybrid exchange environment and our mails get scanned by Microsoft 365 Defender. Since I am the &quot;mail guy&quot; I have to say that Defender Quarantine options are limited and that is why I am asking the sysadmin community to help me out in recommending an additional product or software which can deliver more granularity and control over how spam e-mail is handled. 
 On to the explanations:
  
I just want to be able to block certain senders, block certain swear words from EVER reaching the quarantine. I dont want to blacklist e-mails so they do eventually land in quarantine, I want to delete them.
 Please do not mention transport rules, yes they do exist but I would like to move away from Microsoft in this case.
 The product should not cost a bazillion € since we are a small company, I am not searching for free, but also some high end enterprise solution is out of our scope.
 The product should support integration with O365 and should be in the cloud.
  
Cheers!

                              <span>I have a migration of data from one Windows server hard drive to a mapped network drive hosted on another Windows server to script.
 There&#x27;s roughly 7600 folders and their contents to move from &quot;D:\PMSapp\Data\Archive&quot; to &quot;Z:\PMSdata\Archive2&quot;. Please note that this is NOT everything in the source archive folder, just data specified as paths in a SQL database report.
 How can I do this with Robocopy if my list looks like this:
  
 Source Destination 
  
 D:\PMSapp\Data\Archive\1000032\1000069 Z:\PMSdata\Archive2\1000032\1000069 
  D:\PMSapp\Data\Archive\1000548\1000551 Z:\PMSdata\Archive2\1000548\1000551 
  D:\PMSapp\Data\Archive\100076\1064601 Z:\PMSdata\Archive2\100076\1064601 
  D:\PMSapp\Data\Archive\100076\886195 Z:\PMSdata\Archive2\100076\886195 
  D:\PMSapp\Data\Archive\100076\939607 Z:\PMSdata\Archive2\100076\939607 
  D:\PMSapp\Data\Archive\1000948\1000963 Z:\PMSdata\Archive2\1000948\1000963 
  D:\PMSapp\Data\Archive\1001045\1001054 Z:\PMSdata\Archive2\1001045\1001054 
  .... +7600 more .... +7600 more 
 
 It&#x27;s only the tail directory on each row that needs to be moved but it must include everything in it (including subfolders and files) AND if the folder is empty, the folder itself.

                              <span>Making this post on the off chance anyone experiences what I did. Because it was a huge pain and I found no resources online, plus Lenovo’s premium tech support couldn’t help over the phone.
 Long story short: Borked Windows install on tower and wanted to run an official recovery install rather than a clean one. Recovery Creator was failing to create the installer USB drive.
 Steps initially taken:
  
 Placed online digital order for recovery
  Inserted a flash drive
  Downloaded Lenovo USB Recovery Creator and ran it
  Signed in and selected my digital order
  Let it download the media
  Allowed it to attempt to create the USB recovery key
  
At this point it failed, with a number of errors mentioning that it could no longer find the flash drive and that it failed at partitioning the drive.
 Checked disk management and found it had created a RAW 32GB partition and left the rest of the space unallocated. Looked like it failed after that initial partitioning, right before formatting.
 What it took to get it to work:
 Disk management failed every time I tried to manually repartition or in any way ‘fix’ the USB drive.
 I had to use diskpart, select the disk, clean it, create partition primary. After this I was able to successfully modify the drive through disk management again.
 Some more testing and I discovered you basically have to manually create the 32GB FAT32 partition on a flash drive and most importantly, assign it a letter. Make sure to leave the rest of the drive space unallocated. Then use the recovery creator to actually write the media and create the recovery USB.
 Don’t manually create and format the partition? The recovery creator will try to do it itself and fail. Messing up your flash drive and requiring diskpart to fix.
 Don’t assign a drive letter after partitioning and formatting? Recovery creator will simply fail.
 Best of luck to anyone who may come across this in their time of need.

                              <span>For a yet unclear reason, around 06.06.2023 (exact time is unclear though) our scan to mail setup started breaking with our Epson printers (WF-C20600 Series).
 I read and reread this article a few times and I don&#x27;t see what I did wrong there.
 Previously I had a connector set up but after I read &quot;Doesn&#x27;t work with a connector; never configure a device to use a connector with direct send because such a configuration can cause problems.&quot; I removed the printers public IP from the connector.
 What happens is that for some devices only every third or so scan is successfully send while all other scan jobs produce an NG 313 error code (A communication error has occurred.)
  
SPF record is there
 Printer are NATed to the same public IP which is white-listed (https://i.imgur.com/DsGZuEK.png)
 Tried TLS/StartTLS and without, didn&#x27;t notice a difference
 Got a packet capture but I really could not find any smoking gun here
  
Is direct send in general prone to problems?

                              <span>Hi all, I’m not really a system administrator but need some advice regarding a potential solution that could work for an office with about 5 network drives. Each of these drives is chock full of data with a very well maintained and organized folder structure/hierarchy.
 Unfortunately, data is organized by project number (and not labeled in any way that’s clear), so it makes it difficult for people to get acquainted and find files for the projects they’re working on. Additionally, since there are so many nested directories, it can take clicking through multiple levels before realizing whether you’re in the right directory to start with.
 Is there a good, ready/easy to deploy system that can create a clean searchable directory of directories and file paths? I’m imaging something where the project number or project name could be entered, and then all various paths relating to the project could show up with labels to make it clear (i.e., Floor Plans: P:/00-1020202-22/Ar/FP/, Mechanical: P:/General Resources/MechanicalCAD/).
 Thanks in advance for the help.

                              <span>I moved to a new company which is trying to deploy Openstack with Cisco ACI, since I am the one with the most experience with Openstack. Deployed it a number of times before but never with ACI.
 The problem here is that I kept getting You have held Broken Packages. whenever I try to integrate Openstack with ACI, specifically the neutron-aci-opflex plugin. All other components are already working and ready including the neutron-api-plugin-aci.
 Perhaps I am missing something? Cisco support is not really helpful here, so I am looking at the community right now.
 To everyone who have a Cisco ACI infra, How many of you guys successfully did this? What’s your process? Currently using juju for this, since it’s the only opensource deployment supported by Cisco.
 (please don’t mention vendors support like Redhat\Canonical, we are already looking at it, please instead tell your story or experience working with this kind of setup)

                              <span>Looking into netopeer2 and comparing with confd in terms of setting up the call home.
 This is the callhome.xml which specifies the parameters and settings for a NETCONF client to establish a connection to a NETCONF server using the Call Home mechanism however it doesn&#x27;t contain the;
  
the port for Call Home i.e, 4334
 the port required for NETCONF one of which could be 7022
  
Whereas in confd, there&#x27;s a command which explicitly does the callhome confd_cmd -c &#x27;netconf_ssh_call_home 127.0.0.0 4334&#x27;
 Is netopeer much different in that regard? It&#x27;s just I can&#x27;t seem to set up communication with the client

                              <span>Boss is floating the idea of using eduroam for our campus. She had it at her previous job. We had eduroam many many years ago, just when I started working here, so not that familiar with it. The people who were around that time are no longer here so I’m not sure why we moved away from it. From what I’ve read it looks like 3rd party wireless hosting. Being the only network guy that sounds great as it may relieve a lot of responsibilities but I’ve been around long enough to know not to trust my initial instincts lol. 
 So what are your thoughts on it as far as cost, features, ease of use, fit, etc. ? We currently use clearpass w Aruba controllers and APs. We average around 1200-1500 wireless users. Mainly we provide public/unsecure and staff-only access (read: nothing fancy).

                              <span>I am working through a plan to replace some core network switches in our datacenter and wanted to solicit some advice from the community here. 
 We have three sites in a ring (more like a triangle) topology and run EIGRP as our routing protocol. Each site has a pair of core switches that handle the intersite connections. Site A connects to site B via 2x1Gb links currently in a L3 Portchannel. Site B to Site C is single 1Gb and site C back to site A is single 1Gb link (all those using L2 connection with SVI&#x27;s). Site B is getting an upgrade to Nexus cores so we will no longer be able to run a L3 PC with VPC back to Site A.
 I am curious what you guys would do with this topology. I am contemplating running routed links everywhere like this. Will EIGRP ECMP this traffic and utilize both paths by default or is their additional configuration that needs to be done? Any other pros/cons to this design?
 Another option I am tossing around is doing a simple L2-VPC and running SVI at both ends like this.
 I would love to hear your thoughts and talk through the different solutions here. Thanks in advance.

 I made some &#x27;not so critical but important to know&#x27; change on customer network and things did not get as my expectations.
 So the edge topology consist of 2x Switch and 2x router redundancy. Switches trunked for all VLAN&#x27;s.
 They use seperate eBGP on both routers for both ISP&#x27;s. One of the ISP&#x27;s use different IP&#x27;s but other one use same IP and story begins here.
 Since this ISP making two BGP with same IP but customer side is L2 neighbor, the switch buffers populated with whole MAC flap logs.
 Safety alert, this ISP is secondary for both download and upload.
 Since i saw the switch CPU load that connected to primary router for iBGP VRRP, my first assumption was these L2 flaps because the MATM process consuming %30 CPU (totaly CPU load was %60-65) and this can be easly fixed with …</span>

 Site A is our HQ: 10.x.x.x
 Site B is remote site: 10.160.x.x, connected via fiber (layer 3) 
 Everything at Site B is routed to Site A. ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.255.254.4 (core sw at site A)
 Remote Site Core: Created a new guest vlan (vlan998), Ip address 172.16.9.1 255.255.255.0 ip helper 10.10.10.24. 
 HQ: Created dhcp scope, 172.16.9.15 - .254. Gtwy 172.16.9.1
 Clients are getting dhcp, and can ping internal 10.x.x.x devices (will setup an ACL for security later after this is working). Can ping dns servers.
 172.16.9.x guests however cannot get to internet.

 Info from HQ core:
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.10.200.1 (firewall)
 ip route 10.0.0.0 255.0.0.0 10.255.255.2

 Also running OSPF so can post that if necessary.

                              <span>I work at an ISP and i&#x27;ve been noticing a particular MAC Adress trying to connect to the network, but it gets rejected by the firewall. I think it might be some disconnected client who never turned off their devices, but i can&#x27;t tell with only the MAC. So i had an idea: ¿What if i let it connect to my network? Create a subnet for it to connect where i know it cant cause any harm on my net nor obtain information about it. And now that i have that device in my network, look for a way of obtaining more information about him.
 All in all, i want to know from people with experience in networking if in general this would be a good idea: Let an unkown host connect to your network so you can get more information about him, but heavily controlling its traffic and permissions so he wont be able to do anything inside your net.

                              <span>Our company is migrating from Brocade/RUCKUS switches to Extreme. I managed to get one of our new Extreme switches online and passing traffic with no issue. While waiting for compatible SFP modules to arrive, I had it connected to our Brocade stack with a copper line configured for trunking on the Extreme side. 
 The SFP modules arrived and I was able to get them connected, set the VLANs, and OM3 MMC line came right up. The problem however is that once a users DHCP lease is up, if they&#x27;re connected to the Extreme switch, their device won&#x27;t obtain a new lease. When either line (fiber or copper) is connected, there&#x27;s no issue. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a routing a loop as anyone who&#x27;s lease isn&#x27;t up yet is operating fine. I confirmed the correct VLANs to communicate with our AD servers were present. 
 On the Brocade side, both lines out of the Extreme are connected to the same switch. None of our ports on any of our Brocades are configured for trunking, but is that my issue?
 ​
 Extreme:
 50, 52 configured as LAG and trunk
 1/50 fiber
 1/52 copper
 ​
 Brocade
 ports not configured as LAG or trunk
 2/2/5 fiber
 2/1/23 copper
 ​
 ​
 TLDR: Switch not passing DHCP traffic when both ports in a LAG/Trunk configuration are connected

 So I&#x27;m working through a new PA migration (first time ever on Palo&#x27;s) and I&#x27;m at the point now where I have the rules built and during testing I&#x27;ve been getting odd results in the logs..
 Long story short, I have amended some changes today but before I say what they are, initially I have a test VM going out to certain websites that it was only permitted access to through the use of URL category rules (not filtering profiles), this worked fine, I didn&#x27;t get the Palo Alto splash screen page that you get when you use filtering profiles, but for all intense an purposes, it worked fine. But when I go to check the logs (traffic logs), I&#x27;m seeing the machine is triggering as &quot;allowed&quot; on rules its not meant to be allowed on, so for example...I have a rule that allows all internal users to go…</span>

 Not sure if this is a weird question or not, but the documentation I&#x27;ve sourced doesn&#x27;t seem clear, so I figured I would post it here in hopes someone has achieved what I am hoping to do.
 The company I work for uses Cradlepoint Netcloud Manager to look after all of our customer routers.
 We have about 1500 or so in the field so not that many by all accounts.
 What I am looking to do is regularly speed test all of the routers and save that information in a report or some sort of dashboard.
 It&#x27;s come to light that one of our clients, which themselves have around 150 routers, has started to experience poor speed performance across the board.
 They got notified of this issue when individual sites would start complaining about poor speeds and performance - They setup an internal spee…</span>

                              <span>Hi,
 a number of ISP&#x27;s including AltNets are using DHCP to assign IP&#x27;s where in the past they would have used PPPoE. I&#x27;m just wondering why the transition &amp; how they are ensuring accountability. 
 I&#x27;ve worked for a number of global ISP&#x27;s in enterprise services but never in the broadband space so just wondering how they ensure they meet the challenge of being able to be certain that a certain IP actually belongs to a specific customer.
 It&#x27;s not that hard to change the advertised MAC &amp; IP of the device connecting to their network, I guess they could tie the customer IP to their demarc interface &amp; be certain that anything coming into their demarc is from that subscriber regardless of MAC or IP.
 Just curious as to how they meet the audibility regulatory requirement without the customer using a username &amp; password to authenticate their conenction.

                              <span>Hi everyone!
 Is anyone also experiencing memory leak issue in their ACX1100? We have experienced multiple occurrences of memory leak on ACX1100 installed and would require reboot to be performed as workaround for the router to be performing again. Have verified that ACX1100 due to its design limitations, memory leak is occurring due to routes and/or routing processes which the router cannot handle. Would like to know if anyone have encountered the same issue and what has been the resolution in your network scenario.
 Monitored that memory leak on the ACX persists even after upgrading JUNOS from 20.2R2-S1.3 to 20.4R1.12. Verifying with JTAC, memory leak is triggered due to device configuration but the root cause for the permanent fix is due to software PR. I am still awaiting next service release for JUNOS 20.4R3-S8 to confirm with Juniper if memory leak issue finally resolved for next service release.
 Thanks!

                              <span>Greetings:
 We are upgrading from a pair of SN2010 (eighteen 10/25Gb ports + four 100Gb ports) to a pair of SN2100 (sixteen 100Gb ports) for our TOR switches. These switches are all running the Onyx operating system.
 We have deployed several sets of SN2010 switches for us and our clients over the past four years. We decided to upgrade to SN2100 to get more port density by using 100Gb optics and breakout cables. 
 We configured a SN2100 switch and swapped it in for one of our SN2010 switches. 
 This issue we are having is that whenever we connect a host one of the four breakout pairs, the port flaps every 30 seconds. We have configured the new switch port identically to our existing switches and connected to existing hosts that have Mellanox NICs in them. 
 When we connect the same 10/25Gb breakout to another switch, we have no issues. We only experience the issue when we connect a host (server or workstation) with SFP+. 
 We&#x27;ve used a 100Gb to 25Gb converter with both an optical transceiver as well as DAC cable and get the same results; the port stays up when connected to another switch (Mellanox or other brand) and the port flaps when that same connection terminates into a host (server or workstation).
 During the time the port is up, we have connectivity.
 Any ideas what this might be or what to try next?
 Thanks in advance.

                              <span>What’s going on with Office 365 this week? Increasing number of users having Office desktop apps crash, starting on Monday. Mixture of users having problems and some not having, all on same OS (win11 22h2) and all on same Office version. Anyone else have these issues? MS and our MS partner have not helped as of yet….

 Wow the first one at a new job stings the most am I right?
 Just wanted to point out that admitting guilt for things is the way to go. Logs tell the story so never try to twist the story around 
 Manager thanked me for my honesty.
 Anyone else have similar stories and felt good being up front? We are all human after all

                              <span>Hello,
 I am learning how to write scripts to make work easier. But at my current stage I constantly find myself relying heavily on the Microsoft docs. Like if they have an example of updating a user in AD then I will use their code as a base and customize as needed (after a couple of hours reading about how to use the parameters). When did you become confident in your ability to write scripts as a sysadmin? I&#x27;m a CS major, husband, father, working full time. I feel like my progress is super slow, because I have been trying to learn this role and balance personal responsibility. Any insight would.be greatly appreciated.

                              <span>Had a situation today. Boss called about &quot;not getting&quot; an email form 33 days ago qand asking us to look for it. We use Proofpoint for spam filters, but those logs only go back 30 days. We also have another on-premise mail archiver. We found the email in that archiver and were able to extract it, and then forward it to the boss.
 He then asks us &quot;Why didn&#x27;t I get this email on the day it was sent?&quot; Well it was in the archives, so it must have gone into the mailbox. But boss was claiming he never saw it so did not believe me when I was explaining that it was delivered on XYZ date.
 Not really sure now to handle this situation. I explained we found it and recovered it from his mailbox, but I could not say why he &quot;never received it&quot;

                              <span>So recently I&#x27;ve been getting fed up at work. Typical complaints, micromanagement, mandatory overtime, off the clock work, and lots of comp-time that never seems to actually get burned. So I&#x27;ve been poking around looking for a new job while I finish my Graduate and I&#x27;m thinking about going part time to manage the workload.
 Several times I&#x27;ve been approached on Indeed or LinkedIn by various recruiters. The pitch is always the same. &quot;Hey we think youd be great for this InfoSec position/DB manager, it&#x27;s full time but fully remote and there&#x27;s no set schedule so you can work around school.&quot; There&#x27;s then 2-3 calls with someone who helps me polish my resume for the position and once I even had 3 calls with the rep and her manager to make sure I was a good fit. Then the second my resume is all dialed in BOOM! &quot;Sorry, but they just filled that position. Would you happen to be interested on their overnight part time housekeeper position though? It pays a whopping $12/hr!&quot;
 I&#x27;m not even sure if it&#x27;s incompetent recruiters, incommunicative clients, or just a straight up scam to steal my personal information or something. All I know is it&#x27;s getting old.

Right now we&#x27;re using Ivanti to push sytem updates but eventually we are moving to WSUS, not sure what there is for Dell specific updates though.

                              <span>Fucking hell
 Been tracking down an intermediate email delivery issue for the better part of a month, only to find out our gateway has blacklisted the entire AWS IP range. So any website using Amazon SES to send emails will never get delivered to our domain.
 Guess what our main website uses to send web form submissions.
 Apparently ‘cuda relies on SpamCop for its lists which you guessed it, blocks the entire AWS range.
 I originally requested a bounce back report from our website builder, who maintained that there was no issue they could see, until I pushed back last week to run a bounce back report, sure enough, 290 emails since late may were never delivered.
 Imagine spinning in circles getting this figured out with 3 vendors (host, dev, barracuda) telling me they couldn’t figure it out.
 I think I’m more surprised that no one else has reported this via Google results.

                              <span>I have a user that thinks a hacker is out to get him. They downloaded an app on their phone to show where all the microphones and cameras are hiding in their house and office to record them . When I pointed out that there was nothing on the wall where the app said there was a camera, they said it must be to small to see. They know someone was in their house because they were missing their sunglasses at home, and the glasses were on their work desk when they got to work. So the &quot;hacker&quot; also has keys to his house and our office, supposedly. They reloaded their personal laptop and then said that the BIOS is hacked because it created an X drive while reloading. His work computer is hacked because there are updates with all capital names, and some without, and that&#x27;s not how Microsoft would push out updates. Email that takes longer then a few second to receive from their personal account to their work account is because they are being intercepted, edited, and then delivered.
 Once a week I get emails with walls of text and screen shots, wanting to know things like why does the All users folder look exactly like the Program Data folder?
 Currently, they are pulling up the dev console on any financial sites (They work in accounting) and saying that the java script does not look right. I told them to make a report with the financial institutions and let them know their concerns.
 Has anyone else had to deal with people ill like this at work? What is the best course of action that you have found? I talked with HR and my supervisor, but neither acted like it was a pressing concern and suggested I ignore their emails.

                              <span>I’m extremely new to the IT world and I finally got another job interview. Teksystems Field service technician. It’s a contractor job 20/hr. I recently got sec+, a secret clearance and just 3 months of help desk technician experience from the AF. I’ve never been a contractor nor have I ever had a big adult job like this before. Just wondering if there are better places to start or if I should shoot higher? Not sure about taking the job atp in time.
 Update: what I’ve gathered from the comments is that I should take the job for experience/resume purposes, stay for at LEAST 6 months, get a job that requires me to keep my clearance and just go up from there

                              <span>Two weeks ago I read this post about PCNS 5.x https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/14440hx/apc_now_requires_you_to_pay_for_license_if_you/
 Yesterday I manually updated one of my client&#x27;s NMC3 cards with the latest (2.5.0.6) firmware version. Looking at the device via web browser after the reboot there was a banner stating:
 2.5.x is the last NMC3 firmware version that will be available without an NMC3 Support Contract.
 I spent 20 minutes on the phone with APC Support to get some idea of what this was about.
 It seems that on May 1, 2023 APC/SE announced this change, which will become effective in Q3. There will be 1, 3, and 5 year contracts ranging in price from $50 to $225 (or as TDSynnex indicates $90 to $405 MSRP).
 Here&#x27;s the only link the CSR was able to provide: https://download.schneider-electric.com/files?p_Doc_Ref&#x3D;SPD_HEPN-BFRL57_EN&amp;p_enDocType&#x3D;Brochure&amp;p_File_Name&#x3D;NMC3+Support+Contract+FAQ.pdf

 First of all: I am green in this field. Like completely. I&#x27;m a computer scientist who recently graduated. I needed a break from software development and so I came across this field. I&#x27;m 27 and currently work as an IT-support at a company with 50 people. I have been here for less than 2 months and I am the only IT-personnel. I quite frankly have no idea wtf I am doing. Activities, software and terms such as Active directory (AD), Azure, MS-licenses, DHCP &amp; DNS, switches, managing networks, servers, RMM, updating critical firmware &amp; software, syncing AD with azure, securely setting up mobile devices allowing colleagues to use e.g. Outlook (and much much more) are all things that I am learning about but have never done or heard of before. I am slowly but surely getting a generel unde…</span>

                              <span>I have a user using the local Outlook client on W10. The Help Desk has pushed this issue up to the Sys Admins saying it&#x27;s a server side issue.
 The user has a basic Outlook rule they enable when they go to lunch/are out of office to forward any emails sent to them to their coworker. They enable/disable this rule when they don&#x27;t need the forwarding. However, when they try to disable this rule - it will continually re-enable itself. 
 Things we&#x27;ve tried:
 - Delete and recreate rule
 - Ran Office Repair
 - Deleted Mail Profile and recreated it
 - Ran Clean Rules Wizard
 - Delete SRS File
 We&#x27;ve confirmed other clients are not having issue. When attempting to turn off the rule in OWA, it appears to be disabling it in the local client correctly however. The opposite doesn&#x27;t work. We&#x27;re a hybrid O365 environment. I&#x27;m not understanding how this works - does anyone have any information on what would cause this or some things to try?

 Has anyone experienced issues with Fortimail after updating the version. 
 Performed an update 3 weeks ago and the end users cant login into Webmail to release the Quarantined mail. (The function to release from the quarantine email works) 
 We mange different company&#x27;s both 365 and Exchange servers users are not logging in anymore. 
 Any advise or suggestions?

                              <span>Hi everyone,
 I&#x27;m about to send a couple of laptops that will be used by a couple of users overseas. I&#x27;d like to hear your input on settings that I should turn on. I use Datto and Intune to manage the laptops. These laptops will be restricted and monitored very heavily.

                              <span>The company I work for has been using OneDrive for file sharing. We have 9 physical locations in different parts of the state. Each location also has their own IP scheme. The company uses Mac&#x27;s which I am in the process of replacing and creating a domain. The users do not have unique logins at this time. The CFO wants another solution as he doesn&#x27;t like OneDrive for file storage and neither do I. If we had a domain it would be easy to implement a file server with access permissions but since we don&#x27;t have that yet I am looking for a solution. Does anyone have any recommendations on a good way to resolve this issue until the domain is in place? I know I could build a file server in Azure that everyone could access but then we have the security aspect of folders not being available. I thought about a storage device like Nasuni but again the folder permissions issue arises again. Thanks in advance for any suggestions.

                              <span>Hopefully you guys may have some solutions, but i have a few critical sites that my firm manages, and we have a few different monitoring applications we use for our own server infrastructure and websites individually. The issue I am running into is if a site was to go down at 3am my time (EST not that it matters) but i am sleeping. I have push notifications on my iphone, and have them classified as Critical alerts, so it will even come through on DND mode. BUT i am asleep, so one notification sound doesnt wake me up. I need like an alarm going off that i must dismiss, or separate device to deal with this. 
 I am hoping that there are others out there that might have a simple and good solution they have setup. I know there are enterprise level services that can do this type of thing, but I am a small business and that would most likely be too costly and unnecessary. Any ideas or recommendations to check out would be appreciated.

                              <span>Good morning all!
 -So yesterday, we started experiencing Outlook PRE in all of its glory.
 -a few end-users (who swear they didn&#x27;t click the &quot;try the new Outlook&quot; toggle) ended up with Outlook Pre and it was stuck pinned to their taskbars with no way to unpin it?? On top of that, it bricked their Office 365 install AND broke their MFA so we had to reactivate their 2FA on all of those devices just to get it working again.
 -I have found some registry changes online to remove the toggle for new Outlook, but I am not sure if this is the same thing as the Windows Mail app seems to be gone on these workstations as well. While we ALL know one thing - end users lie lol, we also know Microsoft likes to use us as their beta test guinea pigs sometimes..
 ​
 -How TF do we stop this? so far it has only been a few workstations, but since it is bricking their 365 AND their 2FA, this could turn into a management nightmare and bury our guys fast. Anybody have suggesstions? My google-fu hasn&#x27;t led me to a KB or anything pushing this program, but is creating a monitored service for that registry key that disables the toggle our best option?

 I have a ton of Powershell scripts that send and receive SFTP transfers using the WinSCP dll. Does anyone know of an alternative that isn&#x27;t OSS that you could recommend?

 After restarting the server everything was ok. SEL showed entries &quot;DDR4_A2: Correctable ECC Asserted&quot; around 60 times a minute before the restart. 
 Windows also reported WHEA warnings (hardware error occurred). After restart, server has been running for a day now without any warning or error. It&#x27;s located at a remote location, so I haven&#x27;t had a chance to reseat DIMMs. RAM tests come up clean. System BIOS is from 2018. Is this a case of bad RAM or can I do something before travelling to service the server?

                              <span>I can&#x27;t find any document for best practices on the ideal or expected number of AD groups per user. We have about 1500 users, and 11000 groups. Know anyone who has hit the 1024 hard limit on groups per user? We have.
 I&#x27;m not in the team that supports AD, but on hearing that my Spidey sense went off that it&#x27;s a sign things have gone horribly wrong.
 But the team that supports AD claims they only follow best practices. I&#x27;m looking for anything that indicates a best practice or expected user to group ratio, so I can document the issues, to get some cleanup started.

                              <span>So, there are lots of good blocklists available. But 1 thing is kinda worrying, is the absence of ipv6 addresses. If I enable ipv6 on the router, almost 90% of the traffic is ipv6.
 Do bad actors only use ipv4?
 Is this a reason to not enable ipv6? How are most of you handeling ipv6 security?

                              <span>As the title says. You can&#x27;t fleece or finesse your way getting local, high-skilled techs to do your work for you, run your business, onboard clients and expect to streamline your work in a matter of a few years, while sitting back drinking, snorting powder, or whatever pipe dreams you have. It may work for a little while, but you will eventually end up with employees, and clients alike, who will devalue your business to its demise. 
 Where I&#x27;m from there&#x27;s a toxic culture of this at the moment. Just because you started your IT career in 08 doesn&#x27;t quantify your business for 15 years in service with a solid client base, when you decided to break off in 2018 and &quot;be your own boss&quot;.
 Now, this is mainly for prospective employees looking to get into the MSP realm, fresh out of college, first IT jobs. Be very, very careful when applying and accepting positions for MSP&#x27;s. Do your research, look up the directors and consultants and their history. If you don&#x27;t, you will burn your resume with short stints at these failed businesses, who fight over breadcrumb clients with their empty promises of a seamless silver service. 
 Always ratio the business in terms of current techs to managed clients before accepting a position - at the moment a safe zone and job security is 1:50, and may even move more towards 1:75 1:100 as more businesses go cloud. Anything less and you are only going to fill a void for 6-12 months and end up in the endless cycle of last in first out, as business goes through peaks and troughs at certain times of the year. 
 This is not speculation, it&#x27;s a reality.

                              <span>Hi guys,since the rpi4 prices are going down, and for whatever reason i have the urge to build a cluster...redundancy is a big goal of mine, im wondering if network booting via a NAS server is a good way doing so (instead of booting via SD Card). or is there another hardware/software solution for having network drives for running an OS?
 i would be happy if you guys can give me hints for what i have to look for.
 info:price range is between 500-700$ without the Pis.the cluster would be out of 5-10Pis each should have about 100gb storage.

 I&#x27;m having a problem where the roaming signatures in Outlook are happening for users on a RDS server. I have tried to make the registry work, but unfortunately this is not a solution. Has anyone been able to stop this function from appearing on a RDS server?

 I have a SQL 2012 server that I&#x27;m trying to get to send emails via SMTP 365 but I only seem to get errors of &quot;Activation failure.&quot; 
 SQL is also showing the mail queue type as INACTIVE
 Im pretty sure that is the issue but it also seems odd that there is no ID, just NULLs in the next 3 coloums 
 any ideas?

                              <span>I am trying to create a Domain Isolation Policy in Transport mode - Authentication Header.
 I saw a tutorial where in the IPSec configuration is in the &quot;Advanced Windows Firewall settings&quot; and another tutorial where in the IPSec configuration is in the &quot;IPSec Policies on Active Directory&quot;. 
 What is the difference between them?
 How do I deploy Ipsec in transport mode (AH)?

                              <span>I am at my lowest with job seeking for 4 months, last time I bas baited by recruiters and teamlead of a company that they would like to see me in interview for aws cloud engineer..wondering where they got that as I had only onprem experience in my cv and no cloud experience, however that is my dream job so naturally I agreed, 1st round went smooth assuring me that manager wanted to see me despite my hands-on aws experience, I hyped up, started learning aws fundamentals at least for aws and after 2 days on 2nd round I got rejected in 5 min as they are looking for big d*ck kubernetes and containerization guy..feeling like shit after 6th interview (network security) which didn&#x27;t go well, fucked up market, a lot of positions seeking savior to their tech debt from bad management decisions..I dont want to do that and be stuck again for 5 years without cloud experience..
 I think I finally made peace with leaving my network security experience and go into cloud studies in my free time. Market is shit and they never look for junior, also cost of living is catching up with me and money for such lower position are not there..
 Still, Id need advice on which cloud to choose for chance of prospecting position in EU. I know AWS dominated in USA - anybody has an idea what is more dominant in EU? AWS or AZURE? No idea if my firewall engineer experience accounts to something here, but I guess I stopped caring at this point.
 Also, are there security related positions not requiring me to be semi-skilled developer in cloud? Which certs to focus on?

                              <span>Hi all. Last week we have got lots of computers where we used Ie Mode in Edge to connect to clients system. This is affecting all our different clients where we use it. In these particular case it dont work to access the tools via chrome.
 Now it continue with more and more pc that get the issue.
 IE just popup with a white window that after a while become a unresponsive IE. I have tried to google it but have not find any new reports.
 Anyone seen a similar issue?

Do i need a subscription to use Yubico on Duo for MFA to use rdp

                              <span>Hi,
 in my company there are developers (4-5) that use a Device Mac OS as a build machine to push to Azure DevOps. The problem is that they use a service account on the Mac OS. 
 The best practice is to use nominal account for users on that device and then logon/logoff for every user, while software runs in background.
 Do you ever encounter this problem?

                              <span>Ideally looking at companies with 10k+ devices/employees.
 We currently do a gold image for specified models of devices. We have quite a lot of strict security guidelines for what we can and can&#x27;t use. It&#x27;s a time consuming process doing a task sequence in MECM, manually doing drivers and BIOS updates and configuring it for lots of different branding packs, languages etc. Windows updates take a long time to deploy and manage. We&#x27;re almost entirely on prem but moving services to the cloud slowly.
 I&#x27;m looking at making it more flexible. Anything is on the table, cost aside.
 Management hear about autopilot and cloud and think it&#x27;s great. Is it? Is it possible at this scale?
 The &quot;ideal&quot; world is: as many people on cloud as we can. Onboarding is streamlined, models / vendor are mostly agnostic. Open up a ton more options for device models etc. Drivers and things are managed much easier, allowed straight out to the internet and updated as needed.
 Again cost is not an issue.
 Only issues: require lots of compliancy. Lots of standard software, endpoint management etc. Lots of office based and remote workers.
 What are you guys doing? What would you like to do? What would you do with infinite budget?

                              <span>Hi Guys,
 Recently created a new Windows 2022 Standard virtual server using VMWARE esxi, however it appears to randomly go into an &quot;unresponsive&quot; state. I&#x27;m unable to ping the device, RDP, access it from the VMware web console and I&#x27;m unable to power off the VM.
 After about 5-10 minutes it will randomly be responsive again and I&#x27;m able to force shut it down/power it back on. There&#x27;s nothing in the windows event viewer logs so I&#x27;m unsure if its a Windows issue or VM. Any ideas?

The company I applied to is gonna give me an extra 20k(putting me into the 6 figure range) and I would have the title of Technical Advisor/Support Engineer. The kicker is that the new position only has 15 days of PTO and I would have a ton of added stress and be responsible for anything that goes wrong while having to brief our military counterparts.

                              <span>Our company is currently using Onelogin as SSO solution, and does have many commonly used apps like GSuite, AWS, Slack, Duo, Github, etc. However, maintaining the admin, and RBAC individually in each app is pretty painful and not effective. Is there any good software which could be used to centrally manage and visualize those permissions and policies?

                              <span>Hey there! Just wanted to share a bit about my background. I joined my company as a network engineer about 3 months ago, bringing along my CCNP certification and previous experience in Cisco networking. Although I have some familiarity with basic Linux commands, my main expertise lies in the networking side of IT.
 Now, here&#x27;s where things get interesting. The senior system administrator recently left the company, leaving me in charge of managing all the systems and servers. To be honest, I feel a bit overwhelmed and lacking in confidence. The senior guy still tries to help me out when he can, but he&#x27;s got his own projects keeping him busy.
 The senior IT guy at our company has over 20 years of experience, and he&#x27;s incredibly knowledgeable. He seems to have a natural understanding of all aspects of systems and developments. Technical stuff comes easily to him, so he never really felt the need to document everything. Before he left, he did his best to teach me, but I must admit it wasn&#x27;t enough for me. I&#x27;m not placing any blame on him, though. In fact, I really liked working with him and learned a lot. I&#x27;m simply sharing my current situation and the challenges I&#x27;m facing in my role.
 Let me give you an idea of what I&#x27;m dealing with. I&#x27;ve got my hands full with various VMs, including a Perforce server, TrueNAS, Active Directory, PFSense firewall, NextCloud, and several customer server VMs. The thing is, I&#x27;m fairly new to VMware systems, Linux, NAS, and PFSense. It doesn&#x27;t seem like the company is planning to hire a senior IT person anytime soon, so it looks like I&#x27;ll be flying solo in the IT department for a while.
 I know I need to upskill and expand my knowledge, but any advice or tips you have for someone in my shoes would be greatly appreciated!

                              <span>Do you all have any luck using AlienVault Open Threat Exchange? I have done some research into open/crowd sourced and cheaper TIL platforms and this one stuck. I am having some issues with it that looks to be on their end. If there are better affordable options I would love to hear something for the sole purpose of researching IOCs and submitting file and url samples.
 My issue upon attempting to Submit a Sample is I get greeted with this message:
 &quot;Submissions
 Invalid &#x27;sort&#x27; parameter &#x27;-addDate&#x27;. Allowed values: add_date, complete_date, description, type, tlp
 You do not have any submissions.&quot;
 ​
 This is even after I submit a domain, but I am unable to submit file samples it appears.
 ​
 Not sure if this is an error on my end or theirs. I utilize open source intelligent information for cyber security research and testing and was attempting to use the AlienVault OTX platform but it seems I am unable to take advantage of their sample submission.

                              <span>I started a Network Engineering role back in November 2022. I like the job but today I was told about another job as a Senior Network Engineer at an MSP for about 20K more. 
 I was always taught that you stay with your company and show loyalty, but later in life I had a Network Engineer tell me that people always bounce around in IT careers. 
 The company I work for now is a family-owned company where people stay for many years if not their whole career (Non-IT). I like what I do and it is easy. Not really challenging I just don&#x27;t know if I should take the advice of moving around. I have never worked for an MSP. I am wondering if I should just stick it out or take the money. 
 I feel like if I leave the company I am with now that I will burn a bridge that I cannot come back to. 
 I guess the question is how long do you all stay at a job before taking another?

                              <span>I&#x27;m a pro-AV integrator and I&#x27;m looking for the various options for copper 10G switches with 25G or better SFP uplink ports. We primarily use Netgear M4300 and M4250 lineup, but we&#x27;re up against stock and lead time issues. 
 Wyrestorm NHD600 Series video endpoints require 10G. They have certified the FS S5860-24XB-U with their product so I&#x27;m not worried about it working, and I can get around any switch GUI or CLI... but I&#x27;m more interested in the stuff that isn&#x27;t on the datasheet. Failures? Support? This only has a 4 year warranty (whereas Netgear is lifetime). 
 I know many here (and myself included) use FS for transceivers, cables, and other fiber products... but I&#x27;m a bit on edge about electronics.

                              <span>Hi /r/networking,
 Unfortunately we plugged some standard singlemode fiber cables with LC/PC connectors into fixed LC/APC sockets. We got a link and didn&#x27;t notice or care for a while but now we noticed (mysteriously) reduced performance. We want to replace the cables to fix this, replacing the sockets would be much more difficult. Does anyone have experience with this situation? Some googling just tells me that this might damage the connectors, but I am not sure how likely this is. Would we clearly see damage with an optical microscope?
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hello, I have a few HP ProCurve 2610-24/12PWR switches that I can only access via Telnet. I&#x27;m trying to get them on to the latest firmware that I found (R.11.123). I downloaded this firmware and placed it in a folder that is being shared over the network, with security and share permissions set to allow Everyone full control.
 ​
 I downloaded and installed Solarwinds TFTP Server and it is currently running. I changed the root folder to be the local path of where this file is located (C:\Users\USERNAME\Documents\Files). Solarwinds is set to permit send and receive from all IPs. No other changes were done.
 ​
 I Telnet to the switches and run the command: copy tftp flash IP R11123.swi secondary -- For IP, I have the IP of the Windows server where Solarwinds is installed and the file resides. I have copied and pasted the file name but have also tried typing it out by hand but I keep getting: 00000K Transport error. I can&#x27;t find the page now, but I saw an HP page that said it&#x27;s either permissions, file name, or the file doesn&#x27;t exist in the location.
 ​
 What am I doing wrong? I&#x27;ve been pulling my hair out for 2 days trying to figure this out.

                              <span>Hey ALL,
 I am looking to upgrade our switch to take advantage of faster available port speeds.
 This is our current model:
 HP 2620-48 J9627A
 https://www.newegg.com/p/0XP-002G-00188 
 We need about the same number of ports as well as at least 1gig ports all the way around.
 I found a couple of options:
 https://www.hp.com/us-en/shop/pdp/aruba-instant-on-1930-48g-4sfp-sfp-switch#techSpecs
 https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/48-port-netgear-gs752tp-v2-switch-l3-smart-48-x-10-100-1000-poe-4-x-...
 Any other suggestions would be much appreciated. We have a basic network so dont need advanced features. Just need enough POE to power our ip phones and the ability to take advantage of 1gig internet speeds.
 Thank you.

                              <span>I am running PoE to an outdoor (non-PoE) access point with a 48 to 12V PoE splitter. Right next to it, I require a 5V line for a non-PoE wifi camera. It would be great if I did not have to run separate 5V USB power for the cam, using a 48 to 5V PoE splitter. Cam cannot use Ethernet. I am wondering if I can do it this way. Will the straight-thru RJ45 splitter carry the power on the same pins? Thoughts?

                              <span>Hi,
 Working on an issue that is causing me a lot of stress. 
 There are many sites that have been cut over to a new internet circuit successfully. A simple swap of cables and minor adjustments, and they&#x27;re off to the races. 
 There&#x27;s one site that just won&#x27;t cooperate. 
 We cut over the site, and SLA monitors show 50%+ packet loss. Link itself has been end-to-end RFC2544 tested by the SP with no apparent issues. 
 What&#x27;s more, a backup link that goes entirely unused once the cutover is complete and testing is performed shows the same high levels of packet loss. This occurs only when traffic is pushed over the link; on idle packet loss is 0% across the board. The same behavior can be observed for latency and jitter. 
 The existing link is unaffected. Regardless of a lower available bandwidth, it is largely stable. The backup link, if utilized when the original link is in place proves to be of a lower than expected quality when utilized, but it is wireless so there may be more elements causing that. 
 The behavior of all monitored connections, including the unused backup link showing high packet loss when migrated to the new link is puzzling. I can only imagine that it would be down to electrical interference or poor grounding quality as I have tested all other elements isolated from one another to ensure it wasn&#x27;t caused by the site equipment. Some hardware replacements or failovers have been made to no avail. 
 The routing, switching, and new circuit are all in the same rack. The existing circuit is wall mounted in the same room. The backup link modem is in another room, but is connected by a single cable back to the rack and is otherwise not grounded. 
 Would this be a reasonable element to look in to in order to troubleshoot the issue?

                              <span>Hello I have the following setup.
 We are a small company who sells software to hospitals.
 The software is a web application wich is hosted at the costumers network.
 To do maintanance and updates we need access. 
 So we have our company network (192.172.180.0/24) (f.e. just with 3 laptops),
 And a second subnet (network on the left .183.0/24).
 The networks are connected by a sophos hardware firewall.
 on the .183 there are many site to site tunnels configured to the coustumers network.
 So always one site the .183.0/24 and the other site the coustumers network. 
 So to Acess the costumers network we have to connect from the .180 company network to the .183 network to a windows vm with RDP. Than we are on the network wich has the site to site tunnels. 
 My question , can you call that a dmz ?

                              <span>I have a Netgear GS728TPPv2 that I added to the Insight Cloud Portal. We are currently building a new network in our building while keeping the old network setup active. I put the ISP line into a dummy switch that had a line going to the old network setup to keep the building tenants live and a line to the new setup so I can work on configuring the new network switches. I was working on adding vlans to the ports so that some only had the external traffic straight from the ISP and some ports only had network traffic for an internal trusted network that comes from a watchguard firewall. Everything was working great until I made port 1 (where the isp comes into the switch) a tagged port with the external vlan (999) and management vlan (1). The moment I did that, the switch lost connection to the cloud AND it &quot;broke&quot; the internet for all tenants on the old network set up. See the attached network diagram for more details. Now I wiped the GS728TPPv2 and removed it from the cloud. Even from factory default settings, the moment I connect the GS728TPPv2 to the dummy switch, it breaks the internet for the users on the old network. How do I fix this loop/routing issue?

                              <span>So in a TCP connection, if a port is closed and recieves a SYN packet, it sends back an RST packet (if I&#x27;m right). I want to do some changes to my Ubuntu so when a client sends a SYN packet to a closed port, the port stays idle and does not send anything so the attacker cannot do port scanning based on the response. How to do so?

                              <span>I know you can get breakout cables to turn a 40Gb port into 4 x 10Gb ports via a breakout cable. I&#x27;ve never used one myself but I&#x27;ve seen they are available. 
 Is there such a think however as turning a 40g/100G port into 4 x 10g ports that you can plug a SFP cable into? 
 So rather than a male connector it would be female I guess? 
 Does that make sense? so instead of a 40Gb SFP port I now have 4 x 10Gb ports? 
 Thanks!

                              <span>Hi all, looking into VMware SD-WAN (Formerly or still Velocloud?) and got a few questions. For our business, it seems great so far given it can do per-packet flow over multiple connections rather than per-session flow so that we can aggregate multiple connection together for a single client. Being able to have a routed subnet is crucial for us given we host a few email servers, file servers, and websites out of our office. So, if we grab two velocloud devices and place one in our colo in the data center, and one here at our head office, are we able to propagate an IP block we get from the data center over the velocloud to use for our core router at the office? We have VPN connections, and lots of different configurations I&#x27;d rather not have to change and would prefer if we could use the velocloud to push us that routed subnet possibly via BGP to our router where it can pick it up. Is this something Velocloud is able to accomplish or no?

                              <span>Wow, after some reading it would seem that I&#x27;m no the only one with a story to tell.
 Have a Dell R730XD, was operating fine for majority of its lifetime.
 Recent times strike and we face issues with the server erroring and shutting off, requiring a power drain and manual power on.
 Reached out to Dell support on the 15/05/2023 to advise of the issues and to share the iDRAC logs.
 Dell support request diagnostics of disconnecting the BPs to see if the issue goes away, given it was an intermittent issue it came and went, however they attempted to mark it as a resolved case.
 Couple of days later and the issue becomes worse and now Is happening non stop, server is barley able to function given it keeps forceful shutdowns on itself.
 Dell still reluctant to send replacement parts continue to …</span>

                              <span>Okay, so here it goes. I work for an MSP where it&#x27;s a very small number of people (30, whole company) supporting literally thousands of pcs and servers as we have a fair number of clients. We are constantly swamped, under pressure, behind, but they don&#x27;t want to pay another person. On top of all of this, there are serious communication issues.
 This is my first experience with an MSP so I don&#x27;t know what&#x27;s normal and what isn&#x27;t, but 1 am being paid 35,000 a year for this and I&#x27;m about done. I took the crap salary for the experience and l&#x27;ve gained serious experience with Exchange, 365, ADs, firewall policies, dhcp, etcetera so it wasn&#x27;t a complete loss.
 My issue is : I&#x27;m ready to take the experience learned and jump ship, but I&#x27;m scared that maybe it&#x27;s just this rubbish everywhere. Is this normal? What&#x27;s a normal workload? I have only had a couple years of work in IT before this. Is this just the world of sysadmin, network engineer in general? Hit me with your stories and experiences

                              <span>Anyone else screwed over by this? I just found out because CloudFlare sent me an email warning me about the massive change. Seems like Google kills everything that is good.
 Personally, I would like to just transfer all of my domains to Cloudflare&#x27;s registrar and keep all renewals managed in the same place, problem is they don&#x27;t take the newer TLDs like .dev.
 Anyone have any suggestions on registrars that are friendly to use when you manage tons of domains? 
 Also need advice on downtime, I have never actually transferred domains from Google before. Ideally I would want to be able to make sure that the Authoritative NS are set to Cloudflare on the new registrar side before transfer so that there is no DNS issues and down time, and no recreating a bajillion DNS records.
 I do not pay for Cloudflare either, just using free tier and most domains don&#x27;t even need any proxying. If there is a registrar that makes it easy to import DNS records from Cloudflare, that might be a good option as well.

                              <span>For example, in your day to day roles. How many of you still end up as the T3 or escalation point for help desk, and how many are 100% on infrastructure/networks/applications/etc. 
 Idk why, but it grinds my gears when I&#x27;m trying to focus on something and I get the dumbest escalations from helpdesk, I just facepalm and do basic tasks for them. Either that or ask them what exactly they&#x27;ve done and where they&#x27;re stuck and why it&#x27;s being escalated at all. Even from management on occasion &quot;can you help user with their outlook, x y and z on helpdesk are busy.&quot;
 I&#x27;m wondering if it&#x27;s worth it to pursue a change in my contract to put in a clause where no end user support will be expected of me. What&#x27;s the general vibe on this?

                              <span>I have very limited knowledge about wmi. In the past I have only used gwmi the powershell cmdlet to grab some system Information using WMI. But recently I found that wmi is way more powerful than that. For example, it can be used to monitor a service and whenever it gets restarted, run some script. I want to be serious about this technology and want to learn more about it. Where should I start? Is there any good book about WMI? or websites? I noticed that there seems a whole query language in wmi which is kind of intimidating. I&#x27;m very familiar with sql. But I don&#x27;t know where to start and apply my SQL knowledge to help me understand wmi.

                              <span>I posted previously that I am looking for software to monitor and manage some windows based systems. I already know of RMM tools like Kaseya, NinjaOne, etc. The kind of software I was pointed to (Store Gazer) looks to be more like a DEX system like Lakeside, and NexThink. My questions is what are the fundentmental differences between DEX tools like Lakeside and RMM tools like NinjaOne? 
 From what I can tell, they appear to be very similar. DEX is geared more towards letting the end user fix issues while RMM is more for full remote system management. THey each seem to overlap on some things. I mostly need a system to monitor system resources and try to notice a failure before it hits (like a failing HD). 
 I was hoping someone has had experience with them both and can pinpoint a clearer use case difference.

                              <span>Hello everyone,
 I&#x27;m changing my company&#x27;s ISP from Windstream (T1 lol) to AT&amp;T gig fiber. We will have an SD-WAN but they are coming to install that later so I don&#x27;t have to worry about that. Spectrum will be used as a backup circuit for the SD-WAN.
 I have never switched ISPs for a company before. We have one static IP we utilize. We use a VMware Windows 2012 r2 server for everything as this is a small family business. 
 Am I correct in assuming all I need to do to change us over, is change the IP information in Server Manager/DNS manager and plug the new router in to the switch rack?
 Sorry if this is a dumb one, but I&#x27;m still learning and I want to do a good job here.
 Thank you so much in advance to anyone who takes the time out of their day to help! I really appreciate this community.

 My supervisor left and i&#x27;ve been given command. I was about to given &quot;Sr. Network &amp; Systems Admin&quot;, but with his departure i can take on the title &#x27;VP of IT&quot;. 
 I&#x27;m a very technical person, i love getting dirty in the nitty gritty and working on stuff. If i take this new title of &quot;VP of IT&quot; and want to move on to other technical roles else where, would this title scare potential employers away? With them thinking i&#x27;m either just a manager or they dont want a former head of IT working as some System admin? I want to eventually evolve my career away from networking admin and focus solely on System admin and security.

                              <span>Have a customer who wants login logs for a user. User has been there for years. 
 They removed the license from the account on the 18th. 
 We added it back on the morning of the 19th. However, there aren&#x27;t any login logs before the 18th. Looked in AAD user logs and compliance &gt; audit. 
 What are reasons it wouldn&#x27;t go back before the 18th? If they can be cleared, is there a log kept of it being cleared? I&#x27;ve never had this happen before

                              <span>my understanding is this folder is system based and important for updates.
 sentinelone is constantly flagging files with no real virus mentioned. seems the AI picks up things like OS ENTRY records and Modifies system files as the flags... 
 Is whitelisting for exclusion the CONFIG.MSI folder a good idea.. seems like a good place for virus and root kits to be injected.. that would be where they may try.
 re: \Device\HarddiskVolume3\Config.Msi\3f6ddf.rbf
 thoughts?

Had LAPS up a running for a while with no issues but I now need to add some new Desktops to the domain that have the latest updates on. My understanding is I shouldn&#x27;t deploy the old LAPS client to them but should I be doing anything else? Everything I&#x27;ve read has been about 2019/22. They&#x27;ve got the old LAPS group policy applied to them but it doesn&#x27;t look like the password is getting updated.

                              <span>Hello! We are currently working on finishing up our migration to 365 and working to move printers and internal apps to not use our internal exchange server for SMTP. My boss is a bit worried about direct send/authenticated SMTP to 365 as he has concerns over publishing all remote office IPs within the SPF record (as well as other concerns). I understand the concerns, but feel it may not be fully warranted.
 I was wondering if anyone has deployed an internal SMTP relay that is not an exchange server or any other suggestions to not require publishing all remote office public IPs via the SPF. TIA!

                              <span>I am having an issue in one of our meeting rooms where when a user first logs in, launches Outlook 2016 and tries to join a teams meeting from Outlook (both through the add on for teams in outlook and by clicking the link, going to browser and clicking open app) that the teams app doesn&#x27;t open in the first few minutes. If I wait around 3-5 minutes and then try the add on or via the link they both work just fine.
 Teams also starts when a user logs on, normally ready within the first 20 seconds of being logged in and is definitely running by the time the users try to access the meeting.
 I have made sure the browser, teams and Outlook are all up to date but still have this issue.
 I can only assume that there is something Teams needs to be running before it has this function and it takes around 3-5 minutes for this to run. Does anyone have a fix/work-a-round for this or encountered the same issue I&#x27;d love to know.
 Or if anyone knows what it is teams waits for I could even try looking into finding a way to get this running much sooner in the log on processthat&#x27;d be great.
 Any help is much appreciated.

                              <span>Hey r/sysadmin!
 I&#x27;m starting a new position at an established company that never really had IT and was wondering if there have been any posts where people share their system management stack? If not, I was hoping I could get some examples of what people use and how happy they are with each tool. I&#x27;ve included a few I have touched in my career but it&#x27;s always nice to hear opinions for different size companies. I&#x27;m hoping to cover:
 System Management/MDM (Intune, Workspace One)
 Collaboration (Microsoft 365, Google Workspace)
 Remote control (Logmein, Splashtop, Connectwise)
 Client VPN (OpenVPN, Zerotier)
 Security Camera System (Verkada, Hikvision (ugh), Truvision)
 Antivirus/EDR (SentinelONE, Microsoft Defender)
 EDR SOC addon (Huntress, SentinelONE Vigilance)
 Networking (Meraki, Aruba, Ubiquiti)
 Meetings (Zoom, Teams, Goto, Google Meet)
 Password Manager (1Password, Bitwarden, LastPass)
 Identity Management (Azure AD, Okta)
 IT Documentation (IT Glue, Hudu)
 Messaging (Teams, Slack)
 Email Security (Mimecast, Proofpoint)
 Vulnerability Scanning (Qualys)
 Voip (RingCentral, Teams, Goto)
 SIEM (Splunk, Solarwinds)
 I probably missed a few things on the list but you get the idea. I have never had quite so many holes to fill before and it&#x27;s exciting to be able to build out the entire environment so it can all work together well.
 Thanks so much for the help and I hope others can find this useful too!

                              <span>As IT workers we are often given “keys to the kingdom” which need to be wielded carefully and with great respect and ethics. We have the power to look into anyone’s emails, files, phone call logs etc but as the meme goes, ain’t nobody got time fo dat. 
 Enter Microsoft Purview. We moved over to Defender about a year ago but never really got around to looking into how deep the rabbit hole truly goes. We’re dipping our toes into DLP and some other compliance measures and holy shit the power of Purview scares the hell out of me. Literally every single thing that anyone does across all devices is right there in a near real time list. Of course Microsoft categories for things are all sorts of fucked up but you don’t even have to look for anything specific for peoples entire work lives to just appear before your eyes. 
 Is this all just too much? I honestly feel conflicted in using this as it feels too intrusive. I’ve been involved in many investigations of employee misuse of resources etc but they have been specifically targeted and all actions audited for that exact purpose and the tools for it were essentially under lock and key. Now with Purview it’s all just…there. It feels wrong to me.

                              <span>Title pretty much. We have a POS (piece of shit) software that has a new version that for some stupid reason suddenly requires Administrative credentials to install even though it install under user context (in user AppData). This obviously renders our management tools (PDQ &amp; Intune) unable to perform the installation.
 The support at the vendor is clueless and doesn&#x27;t seem to understand the issue. Apparently in their mind everyone has administrative access so this should be none issue.
 I&#x27;ve run procmon to try and catch the part that triggers the UAC prompt but I&#x27;m not exactly sure what to look for. I believe it is trying to access/write something to the HKLM hive or class root hive.
 Any tips or links to guides would be greatly appreciated at this point.
 Edit: the new version does not have &quot;UAC Compliant&quot; checked when I viewed it in Orca. Any idea if that&#x27;s the root cause here?

 Due to the increasing popularity and widespread usage of ChatGPT or any AI in general, I wanted to explore how AI can enhance the day-to-day activities of sysadmins, enabling them to be more productive and efficient in their roles. I would greatly appreciate it if you could share how you are leveraging AI in your work and the specific purposes it serves.

 I know what is ATA, ATA Architecture, ATA gateway, ATA center and all. But, I am not sure what is the function of ATAGatewayUpdater service ?
 BinaryPathName: &quot;C:\Program Files\Microsoft Advanced Threat Analytics\Gateway\Microsoft.Tri.Gateway.Updater.exe&quot;
 I searched in google but there are no relevant information about this.

                              <span>I&#x27;m a kinda new sysadmin and a user asked if it would be possible to optimise this process:
 He works on department A and creates documentation in this structure:
 \server\department_a\projectx\documentation
 every time he creates documentation there he has to manually copy and paste it to:
 \server\department_b\project_x\documentation
 so the people from department B can get the documentation to send to the clients.
 Is there any way to make it so every time he creates a file on &quot;\server\department_a\projectx\documentation&quot; it is automatically copied to &quot;\server\department_b\project_x\documentation&quot;?
 I&#x27;ve tried making a softlink with mklink command, but it seems that it doesn&#x27;t work on shared folders. Another option that comes to my mind is to create a batch that automatically checks whether a new file is created on said folders and if so it copies it to the other one, but I would like to know if there&#x27;s any other option that I haven&#x27;t thought of.

 What roles would be best to give to this person? I&#x27;m talking about Azure Roles—or other rights or tools to help this person out.
 We are using Azure in the cloud, so there is no on-premise.
 Thank you for the help!

                              <span>Hi all
 Currently working on a project to replace our Dell NX3230 (W2K12 R2 Storage Server). We have had a quote back from Dell and I notice that they are only offering Windows Storage Server 2016 which goes end of life in less than 4 years.
 Obviously, I want to get the best life out of this hardware as we are a small business, but I am now worried that I won&#x27;t even be able to get 5 years out of this bit of kit before EOL.
 It looks to me that I might have to bite the bullet and buy a full Windows Server license for this device so I can run Server 2022, but judging by the Dell downloads page, its unclear if this would even be a supported OS for this hardware.
 Does anyone have any thoughts on this or alternatives I can look at?
 TIA

                              <span>Title, basically.
 Do they simply get IT equipment replaced - no questions asked- when they report their laptop, headset etc lost or missing?

                              <span>We have recently upgraded our Sysmon installation on our clients to version 14.16. However, we have encountered an issue where the configuration file is not being read. The update process itself went smoothly, and everything appears to be working fine.
 Here is the command we used to load the configuration file:
 Sysmon64.exe -c sysmonconfig.xml
 After executing the command, we received the following output:
 System Monitor v14.16 - System activity monitor

 Loading configuration file with schema version 4.50
 Sysmon schema version: 4.83
 Configuration file validated.
 Configuration updated.
 ​
 Despite the successful update, upon checking the configuration, we discovered that it was not being read, and only the default values were being installed. We have attempted various XML files, but since ours have not been changed for some time, the problem persists. We even created a new configuration file with a few rules, but encountered the same issue. Additionally, we tried downgrading to the previous version, but the problem remains unresolved.
 If anyone has any insights or ideas on how to resolve this issue, we would greatly appreciate your assistance.

 Our client is using M365 Business Premium licenses, which do not include CALs. Is it necessary to order Windows Server CALs in order to access on-premise application servers, and if so, under what circumstances?
 Thank you for your assistance.

                              <span>So I&#x27;m looking for a second job. I&#x27;m in a bad financial state, but my current job is low impact that I have a LOT of time to fill during the day.
 So I got pinged by First Cloud Inc. and things sounded very promising. I just got an offer letter today and I signed thinking I&#x27;m getting gainful employment.
 Then I get a text message this evening saying the following https://i.imgur.com/ZJ5X7E0.png
 Immediately all sorts of warning bells start going off. Is this normal? This doesn&#x27;t feel normal. I&#x27;m supposed to get hardware sent to me tomorrow and I start the 22nd.

                              <span>Hey guys, I&#x27;ve been tasked to revamp my wife&#x27;s business IT infrastructure. She has 7 staff, each with somewhat old computers. She wants to upgrade most of them and try to reuse any useful parts from the old ones.
 In the past, she has had issues around user security and people messing up the devices. First thing I&#x27;m wondering is what&#x27;s the go-to solution for desktop device management in small business offices where everyone is using Windows.
 Second, I&#x27;m thinking whether it would be a wise move to buy 1 or 2 excellent servers and just give everyone a Windows VM running in the server that they can connect to via a thin-client from their desks. Does this type of solution work well, or is it better to just give everyone a good dedicated machine running Windows for them to use?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello, 
 First of all before I go in what I need I just want to say I am only a couple of hours of research in, my understanding of things like DSC and infrastructure as code is limited and this is why I am here, so hopefully I can get someone with more experience to give me their opinion on where I should head.
 The gist is that I need to automate environment creation whilst working working with Hyper-V.
 Everything from VM creation, OS installation, integration with AD, setting up of features like SQL Always On and IIS load balancing, I need to be automated with very little interaction, I am going to be deploying hundreds of servers and want to make it reliable and repeatable as possible.
 So my real question is, should I expect this to be easily feasible to implement, if so how do you do it? and do you have any resources you could share like git projects. 
 Many thanks in advance!

 Getting on with it...
 February 2023
 Since I got radio silence from the fiber planning department and the ISP, I decided to call both of them once again, and got the same response: &quot;It&#x27;s done when it&#x27;s done, we&#x27;ll notify you.&quot;
 March 2023
 Middle of march, a parcel arrives at our location. It&#x27;s a router. I didn&#x27;t order a router. It also had no information on who sent the parcel. Deep down in the package, there was the packing list: It was actually the ISP which just sent us a new router, probably for the fiber connection. Great! That means it can&#x27;t take long anymore, can it?

I&#x27;m attempting to setup a PXE boot server with the latest Ubuntu server release (I think 20.04.6) and after setting up the DHCP role and PXE role and grabbing all the necessary files in all the right directories, my client machine can PXE boot to an extent.
 When I network boot on the client, I get the IP info of the PXE server, then the gateway, and then PXE-E32: TFTP open timeout. This repeats 3 times. I verified my settings 3x, but I&#x27;ve been using ChatGPT as my guide. So something is inevitably messed up. Does anyone have suggestions?

 https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1114113/im_a_sysadmin_im_43_and_ive_just_been_diagnosed/
 I read through the post and the comments and found myself relating to almost everyone who talked about their ADHD and diagnosis. I had suspected ADHD for probably a decade, but to me ADHD was just the guy who can&#x27;t sit still and is a disruption to everyone around them, which wasn&#x27;t me. But what I didn&#x27;t know was that my ADHD burnout had been slowly boiling and was at a point where I couldn&#x27;t contain it any longer.

 Upon reboot, roughly half the devices blue screened stating that \windows\system32\winload.efi is missing. 
 If I try and load recovery, it says file \BCD is missing. 
 When I launch recovery from a recovery disk, I can see that bitlocker is enabled and the c drive is locked. When I try and unlock it, the password key is not working. 
 Has anyone seen something similar?

 I&#x27;m trying to work on getting AKS stood up with an HA PG SQL database, multiple vnets for multi region redundancy, and various other items. I scheduled 2 weeks of dedicated time, I&#x27;ve spent exactly 4 hours on it in that time due to doing work for everyone else and managements &quot;priority&quot; shit.
 Today was the last straw when I was asked to do something that &quot;you said would take a minute&quot;, for reference I never said that about this, it was something else that I delivered 2 weeks ago. Top it off, since then the guy has permissions to make a service principal now.
 So I told my boss to text me if he needs me and I turned off slack on my phone and computer. I am late by weeks on so many projects because of this. I can&#x27;t be much more late on this since it&#x27;s needed for multiple other initiatives. I&#x27;m not in trouble or anything but I&#x27;m getting people asking &quot;when will this be done&quot; at this point... The answer is never at this rate.

With very outdated documentation, coupled with an undocumented and partial implementation of different network and server hardware being implemented. I&#x27;ve been mostly in the mode of learning systems as time presented and training a new Helpdesk staff. Eight months ago, we landed on a good fit for that position. Now for the turn. Every chance he gets, he points out everything that needs to be done, the ways he did it in previous places, and how he can&#x27;t believe things can even be supported not being documented and fully understood. Somehow, he has managed to parlay this into now being the IT lead.

 I said to him &quot;Why don&#x27;t you just take the handful of files you need, instead of copying everything by default?&quot;
 He goes, &quot;It&#x27;s easier if I just take it all. Then it&#x27;s all there if I ever need anything in future.&quot;
 Makes no sense. These are work files. Why would you randomly need work files or emails in the future?
 Update:
 I just had a chat with him and explained how insane it was. He gets it now.

                              <span>Curious how teams are doing this today, I know there&#x27;s a variety of options out there that all solve a portion of this pain but wanted to hear from actual orgs in how they may have implemented it or even rolled their own solution.
 Currently my org does this manually at about 40+ people and it&#x27;s pretty painful. We:
 Have a master spreadsheet for all tools
 Owners of these tools are spread across the org mostly with the founders and some founding engineers (trying to transfer ownership to me but with some tools it looks like we need to pay to add more seats)
 Don&#x27;t have a consistent way to manage the security, provisioning and de-provisioning of this today
 We use a Zendesk form in Slack for hiring managers to add tool provisioning requests for their new hires. Same request process for existing employees looking for access to other tools in the org.
 We don&#x27;t have a great way or policy for new tool sign up - I feel like this should go through me but again, very manual
 Curious to hear how you&#x27;re managing this :
  
How big / mature is your org
 What process / tooling do you have in place - what&#x27;s the good/bad/ugly on this
 What role do you play in managing this process
 
 TIA!

                              <span>We currently have a local Active Directory setup for user authentication and would like allow our user to authenticate and log into their computers using their 365 account. We currently have the free version of Azure, which would make hybrid the better option I think since I can still update group policies using the local domain controller.
 My question is, once I setup the Azure AD Connect on the local domain controller, would my users still be able to log into their current AD account to access their windows profiles on their computers? From my understanding, using their 365 to log in will create a new windows profile, which is fine. But I’d still like them to be able to access their windows profile from the local AD account so I have time to migrate settings and data. 
 Thanks

 I am currently in school for a sys admin program and am working on obtaining my Linux+ and eventually Sec+ etc. I wanted to touch upon DevOps however because of the high demand for it but I cannot figure out for the life of me the responsibilities of a DevOps engineer. Does anyone here work in DevOps and can you give me an example of what you do and how you gained your experience / skills.
 Thanks

                              <span>We&#x27;re seeing an issue with Windows Search on Windows 10 21H2. When opening the start menu and searching, the start menu is blank with only dots cycling near the top (like its trying to find something). We&#x27;ve had a case with Microsoft open for months now but they&#x27;re basically useless.
 I believe the root of the issue in that ShellExperienceHost is not running. We&#x27;ve tried re-registering the application on the base image:
 Get-AppxPackage -AllUsers Microsoft.Windows.ShellExperienceHost | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register &quot;$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml&quot;} 
 If I try to start the ShellExperienceHost process manually, we get this error:
 The system detected an overrun of a stack-based buffer in this application. This overrun could potentially allow a malicious user to gain control of this application. 
 In Event Viewer, we see this error:
 Faulting application name: ShellExperienceHost.exe, version 10.0.19041.1949 Faulting module name: KERNELBASE.dll, version 10.0.19041.2913 Exception code: 0xc0000409 Faulting application path: C:\Windows\SystemApps\ShellExperienceHost_cw5n1h2txyewy\ShellExperienceHost.exe Faulting module path: C:\WINDOWS\System32\KERNELBASE.dll 
 I&#x27;ve tried repairing using SFC/DISM. I can recreate the issue with and without our profile management software. I tried an in-place upgrade from 21H2-&gt;22H2 but that also did not resolve the issue. Anyone seen something similar?

                              <span>I&#x27;m working for a mid-size trucking company. We are installing an access control system on orders of the GM and keep butting heads with maintenance or having to deal with them dragging their feet. They are also muttering about it doing their job and playing blame games when their are project issues. Advice and or other experience to draw on would be appreciated. Most places I work it and facilities had a good if at times teasing relationship. 
 Note Their department includes all the workers for the truck fleet and it consists of two people including me.

                              <span>Our tenant (&lt;50 users) is comprised primarily of Business Standard licenses. While I mostly work in AWS and Heroku, as the person who knows how printers work, i am also sometimes tasked with making changes to our Azure Active Directory account. After a recent scare, the CEO finally has learned the value of MFA. I turned off legacy mfa and enabled the security defaults and i&#x27;m looking into setting up conditional access rules but I need to have a Business Premium license. Do i need this license for all users who are subject to the rules created by a BP licensee account, or is this saying that I have to upgrade all of our BS users to BP in order to be protected by these rules?

                              <span>Greetings all,
 We are looking for a software tool that can help auto-deploy VMs for software testing and validation. This tool should allow us to pick a combination of architectures (ARM, x86, M1/M2, etc) and OSes (Mac, Linux, Windows, etc) to auto-deploy either on a local server or cloud device. Once the deployment is done, we will execute some automation tools to validate a test branch of our software, report some findings, and then terminate the test device. The test VMs won&#x27;t live very long; just long enough to run some test cases and record the output (via shared volume, etc).
 At this point, we are looking at a varity of deploment tools (LXD, Docker, Terraform, etc) but have not landed on one just yet. The important thing is the ability to select from a matrix of architecture and OS selections, click &quot;GO&quot;, and ultimately get access to the test systems.
 Hope this makes sense. Thanks for any pointers.

                              <span>[UK] Been in my current job coming up to 3 years. IT for a firm and we have two more firms in other locations and each location supports each other. There 3 of us in the IT team locally and would say we’ve become friends as well as colleagues. The gig is easy but i don’t feel like i’m challenged I manage the helpdesk and AD, Exchange stuff groups, mailboxes etc and provide regular tech support. 
 Buddy works at a ISP that also provides a Business service side like MSP / Datacenter stuff and mentioned a Network Engineer position coming up. If the pay is better i’d be tempted to go for it but I’d feel bad for leaving the team just cause i know it’ll fuck them up for abit with the work. Has anyone else felt like this before and how you navigated it?
 I could stay but i just feel stuck on helpdesk. The sysadmin above me was doing it for like 6 years before he moved up to more server stuff and projects. But i could only go up if someone comes under me or everyone above moves up 1 position but the company would never hire more people we been struggling to get a third in one location since i joined. 
 I don’t hold any certs but studying Net+ at the moment
 I don’t really care for the end users and rest of the company but the IT teams are really great chill guys to work with. But plugging in keyboards or showing people how to use a web browser earning more than me is abit disheartening haha
 TLDR: Possible chance to make the jump from helpdesk to network engineering, Have you ever found it hard to leave your IT colleagues for a new role.

I’ve changed this value yesterday on prem and force synced azuread connect for 50 users in the tenant. However, many users are reporting they can still logon with old value/upn. I’ve done this before on other tenant they couldn’t logon with old upn within a few hrs. is this a token refresh thing? is there a new feature that allows the use of an old upn? Ive not got access yet as I’m in Poland today and admins are West US and I’m waiting for an admin to give me access to check status.

 Is it possible to create a home_folder for a user without the requirement to use and assign a drive letter?
 I want to assign a home_folder to a dfs resource. Everything works ok, but I don&#x27;t need a home_folder that is connected also to a other drive letter. DFS has own drive letter.
 It&#x27;s option to create home_folder on Active Direcory Users and Computer -&gt;User Properities-&gt;Profile-&gt;Home folder-&gt;Connect &quot;I don&#x27;t want to assign letter &quot; -&gt;To: \\company.local\share\home\user (DFS Namespace share)?
 I want share all folders on one share (G). 
 G:\DFS\PUBLIC
 G:\DFS\HOME_FOLDER
 G:\DFS\COMPANY
 I don&#x27;t want H:\HOME_FOLDER

                              <span>Hi,
 Something has changed where before we were able to log into a Tap scheduler with an MTR account (pro licence) without any issues. 
 Now we try to log in, it seems the device wants to enroll to Intune. Is there an easy way in which to bypass this? Is this a config on the Tap scheduler itself or Company Portal/Intune settings that is catching the device logging in and enforcing enrollment?
 error we&#x27;re getting is &quot;Signing out.. This device isn&#x27;t enrolled in Device Administrator. Contact your Admin&quot;. (I am in contact with our admin as well)
 Thanks

 Every once in a while we get system fan errors. The first few times I replaced the fans, but we get so many fan failure errors on these units ,that it&#x27;s come to the point where it doesn&#x27;t make any sense. They seem to spin fine.. No real indications of problems either. No overheating, workstations are cooled using an AC.
 Has anyone seen this before? Dell of course isn&#x27;t any help in this case..

                              <span>Hey guys,
 ​
 Given all the issues Microsoft are having recently how is everyone communicating this to users?
 ​
 I was thinking about having a similar internal health dashboard (not just specific to microsoft) for any issues that might come up, and encourage users to check here, not sure where to start! Any software recommendations?
 ​
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi,
 Has anyone ever considered creating personas for different types of users to enable automation?
 i&#x27;m thinking along the lines of: 
 ​
 Technical Development staff - these will have local admin rights, code app installed, member of development distribution list etc
 Backoffice staff - Marketing, Finance etc, these need MS Office installed and certain other groups etc.
 ​
 The end goal is to have each new starter automatically have 80% of what they need by virtue that I already know their persona so can automate their account creation and being added to certain groups to achieve it.
 ​
 Interested to hear if anyone&#x27;s thought of doing similar or even better if it&#x27;s ended up working out.

 Or should one PSU be plugged into the UPS and the other into a wall outlet?

                              <span>Hi! I have a function app for which I configured a DNS in a private DNS zone within my organization, as well as a private endpoint. The function app uses a Premium EP1 plan, and it is a python function. I configured a storage account in the settings, using WEBSITE_CONTENTAZUREFILECONNECTIONSTRING and AzureWebJobsStorage. Apart from this, I also configured these app settings:
 APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY
 AzureWebJobsDashboard
 FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION
 FUNCTIONS_EXTENSION_VERSION
 minTlsVersion
 STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME
 TABLE_STORAGE_KEY
 WEBSITE_CONTENTOVERVNET
 WEBSITE_CONTENTSHARE
 ENABLE_ORYX_BUILD
 SCM_DO_BUILD_DURING_DEPLOYMENT
 When accessing the function app URL I get an application error. My plan was to then use a Github Actions workflow in order to deploy the functions - but the workflow fails, although the publish profile is correct.
 When request Azure resource at ValidateAzureResource, Get Function App Settings : Failed to acquire app settings from https:///api/settings with publish-profileFailed to fetch Kudu App Settings.
 Service Unavailable (CODE: 503)
 Can anyone please help? I am stuck on this for a long time..

 Quick question, is it possible to make 365 use a different url for smtp? So for instance rather than using smtp.office365.com and then the user name and password for the account it&#x27;s smtp.customdomian.com?
 Thanks

                              <span>Hi all,
 this is just to confirm: the HPE licensing calculator for Microsoft Windows Server suggests that there is always at least one 16-core license pack needed for every physical server (they label this a &quot;base license&quot;). All the other license packs (2-core, 4-core, and 16-core) are labeled &quot;additional license&quot;, which suggests that these cannot be used stand-alone.
 We are thinking about getting 2-core packs only (please do not ask for the reasons, since that is beyond my paygrade).
 Would it be possible to license a server using only 2-core packs? Are there activation keys included in a 2-core pack?
 Thanks in advance!

                              <span>Recently got my hands in a more or less new tape drive : https://buy.hpe.com/us/en/storage/tape-storage/business-class-libraries/storeever-msl-tape-libraries/hpe-storeever-msl-entry-level-tape-automation/p/1011221564
 And have been tasked to make it work by a person who has no idea of how tape drives work . 
 It&#x27;s to attach to a single backup server, no shared infrastructure. So in theory SAS should be the way to go, but the external cards I&#x27;m seeing are much more expensive somehow.
 Usually I would let the vendor sort this out, but that&#x27;s kind of not an option here, so, before I screw up buying the wrong thing, any recommendations? 6GB SAS would be OK, volume isn&#x27;t really huge.

                              <span>My management is blocking my suggestion of the use of Netbox even though my peers feel it would advantageous for us to have. The reason he is blocking it is, 1. It runs on Linux. 2. It is open-source. My management is against the use of Linux in all applications and is also against open-source. He believes Linux opens our environment to more vulnerabilities and potential security risks which I understand is not a fair assessment. He is also against open-source due to lack of official support that we can&#x27;t pay for. He does not like the idea that support comes from blogs, reddit, etc. Frustrating :( 
 ​
 However, currently my team is managing ~100 locations information from over 10-15 different excel spreadsheets. This includes contacts, circuit information, devices, etc. I think we need it but I dont know how to approach it or become a better influencer to encourage the use of it. Any professional help would be good. Thanks

                              <span>I have an environment that uses a combination of a virtual wireless controller and a physical wireless controller. I have 6 ap&#x27;s that were connected to the virtual wireless controller that had a &quot;capwap ap erase all&quot; command run on them. They now will not join the physical 5508 controller or the virtual controller that they were previously connected to. 
 I see the AP mac&#x27;s listed in &quot;show ap join stats summary all&quot; command and if I do &quot;show ap join stats detailed&quot; on the ap mac I see that the physical controller is successfully discovering the device, but it isn&#x27;t going anywhere from there, it never attempts to join because there are no join requests received or denied. 
 SSH appears to be disabled on default and the AP&#x27;s are in locations that are very hard to get to. Any ideas on how to get these things to join up to either of the controllers?

 Can I use 2x ISR 4321 (with 1x NIM-ES2-8 + 1x NIM-ES2-8p poe) instead 2x 3850 switch? I dont need 24 poe ports in each (4x 1830 APs and 12x CAMs). 
 I wont route lans or vlans through those devices.
 Pros, cons? Performance, Noise, power consumption etc

                              <span>My company&#x27;s ISP offers us an ipv6 /56 prefix. We run the fiber directly to our switches and run virtual VyOS firewalls so there is no ISP gear. Now I wonder what options I have for subnetting since I obviously don&#x27;t want to put all of the devices on the WAN side. Still I&#x27;m trying to have redundant firewalls.
 I was thinking I could perhaps select one /64 for WAN and set up both firewalls to send RAs for the same internal /64 subnets and then ask the ISP to tweak timeouts to ensure failover happens without too much delay, like in this example: http://www.bscottrandall.com/9.2.5.html#ra-message-as-substitute-for-fhrp .
 Otherwise I guess I could ask them to route my /56 through e.g. the first IP in the block and then use VRRP on my firewalls. Not sure if they offer dhcpv6 prefix delegation (like you&#x27;d use on a typical home router) and not sure if I even want to use that, since it will limit my options for redundancy. I&#x27;m an ipv6 noob and I feel I&#x27;m maybe missing something obvious.

                              <span>Hello,
 I am a sysadmin for my company whose weakest area is networking so forgive me if I am missing something or if this question is stupid. Our network SME is off this week and I am being asked to look into this issue. 
 All of the wireless devices at a single company location are all of a sudden unable to access our official internal SSID. I checked the event viewer on the RADIUS server and am seeing tons of errors in the Event viewer, more specifically Event 18, &quot;An Access-Request message was received from RADIUS client {server IP} with a Message-Authenticator attribute that is not valid&quot;.
 I did basic troubleshooting such as restarting the NPS service and rebooting the server to no avail. I checked the RADIUS clients and the group configured for this location is showing that it is enabled and that there is a shared secret entered in. I checked our Meraki dashboard and when I looked at the logs for the APs at this location, I see tons of errors with the message &quot;Client failed 802.1X authentication to the RADIUS server. auth_mode&#x3D;&#x27;wpa2-802.1x&#x27; vlan_id&#x3D;&#x27;10&#x27; radius_proto&#x3D;&#x27;ipv4&#x27; radius_ip&#x3D;&#x27;10.11.8.121&#x27; reason&#x3D;&#x27;radius_login_failure&#x27; radio&#x3D;&#x27;1&#x27; vap&#x3D;&#x27;0&#x27; channel&#x3D;&#x27;36&#x27; rssi&#x3D;&#x27;26&#x27; &quot;
 My googling has led me down the path of there being a possible problem with the shared secret and to recreate it. However, I am just looking for some general guidance here and seeking someone to point me in the right direction because I am lost on this issue. 
 Thank you.

                              <span>We have a project where the Vigor 2865 is the router.
 ​
 We have most fixed devices assigned in the router by MAC reservation outside of the DHCP pool.
 We have a few devices that were added and had their MACs added to the IP reservations BUT the IP addresses were IPs that were in the DHCP pool range. 
 Recently we lost communication with a couple of devices and sure enough they were units that had their MACs reserved but their addresses had been occupied by other wifi devices that had joined the network? 
 It was always my understand that if an IP is reserved/assigned to a MAC, then this IP address is specifically for that device? Is this only the case if the IP address is outside of the DHCP pool? If the reserved IP is IN the pool, can any other networked device occupy that IP instead if the reserved device is offline? 
 Sorry if this is a very silly question!

                              <span>Our 2 datacentres are in a different BGP ASN, They have two WAN links each and a bonded etherflow layer2 link between them.
 It&#x27;s been spotted that since our new WAN provider has been installed, traffic between DCs isn&#x27;t favouring the etherflow and is traversing the WAN instead.
 Having done some digging I think it&#x27;s because the SD-WAN solution uses a proprietary routing protocol that is being redistributed into BGP on their routers in each DC. The core switches have &quot;redistribute direct&quot; set with a route-map that sets the metric to 70 and 75 so the connected routes get advertised to both the WAN and the other DC.
 I think what&#x27;s happening is, the core DC switches see the route that was injected into BGP at the WAN router as an iBGP route and favours this since the routes over the etherflo…</span>

                              <span>I am testing different network techniques in a lab environment using RFC 2544. Something I can&#x27;t quite explain is the fact, that MPLS Throughput is about 17% less than IP-Routing for smaller frame sizes (see below):
 IP-Routing: Frames Throughput - 76 bytes 25 Mbps - 128 bytes 43 Mbps - 256 bytes 83 Mbps - 512 bytes 96 Mbps - 1024 bytes 98 Mbps - 1280 bytes 98 Mbps
 MPLS: Frames Throughput - 76 bytes 21 Mbps - 128 bytes 35 Mbps - 256 bytes 67 Mbps - 512 bytes 95 Mbps - 1024 bytes 98 Mbps - 1280 bytes 98 Mbps
 The network itself is really simple and consists of 4 Routers in a ring. The tester sends the data to the input router that forwards the packet over one of the two transport routers to the output router and to the tester at the end and back again. The MPLS configuration was done without special stuff using OSPF as IGP and adding &quot;tag-switching ip&quot; to the interfaces.
 Maybe someone can give me a possible explanation
 Edit: Routers are quite old, Cisco 2811 ISR

 I&#x27;m usually working solo on a remote site with few other people around, so when we have issues with a multicore fibre - usually someone has damaged the cable or mice have broken pigtails - I connect my fibre torch to one end and walk over to the other side to check for the light before repeating until I find a working pair. 
 Is there a device, which could simultaneously test up to an 8 core cable? Visual only for fault finding, anything more specific and we&#x27;d use a contractor.

                              <span>I’m going to be segmenting our flat corporate network and could use some advice. Currently both servers and clients are all on the same network and we just rely on host based firewalls on the servers to protect everything. I’m going to set up separate VLANs for servers, printers, IoT stuff, and client machines, and then route them through our firewall with the appropriate rules. 
 How can I determine what kind of overhead this is going to require from our firewalls? I’m concerned our hardware firewalls may not be able to process the amount of traffic going through it. They currently only process traffic in and out to the internet.

 Long time lurker, but first time to post here :)
 I have a university project where I need to compare, contrast and maybe make improvements in regard to different FHRP protocols like HSRP, VRRP (v2 and maybe v3?) and GLBP from Cisco.
 For this purpose I have bought subscription to Cisco CML Personal license to be able to simulate the environment as I do not have Cisco gear at my home lab. Of the hardware devices I have, there are two Dell 7048 switches, one Brocade 7450-48 and one Dell Force10 S60 switch.
 Of these switches I have not yet had time to start up and configure Brocade switch as I need special console cable. If somebody can recommend a way to use physical servers to maybe set up a real environment where a couple of VM&#x27;s could be conn…</span>

 I&#x27;m a consultant, getting placed with different clients every 6 months or so.
 I&#x27;ve noticed that over the last year and a half, I keep getting placed in companies that want to call all their network engineers &quot;DevOps&quot; engineers, and end up being put on projects that have very little to do with networking. 
 The current one I&#x27;m doing is building a lot of grafana dashboard and using InfluxDB. 
 Whilst I do find this fun in my spare time on my home lab, I&#x27;m not a DBA or a software engineer, and I&#x27;ve really been struggling with doing this work professionally. 
 I feel like every role I am straying further and further from actually being a network engineer, and I&#x27;m forgetting things. I&#x27;ve been trying to recertify my CCNP and really struggling, because I&#x27;m just not using any of the knowledge. 
 Has anyone else had similar experiences in their roles?

                              <span>I&#x27;m working on setting up our new office routers, we already have 2 ISP connections going into our single router. However since we are now upgrading to 2 new routers (Mikrotik CCR2004-1G-12S+2XS) HA is crucial. 
 For setting up HA I thought VRRP looks good, however at this stage I&#x27;m a bit confused. Can I just set the ISP static IPs on 2 different interfaces on each router, then setup a simple VRRP and it will automatically handle this? Even if the slave router is inactive could it still not cause issues to use the same public IP as the other router in terms of routing tables at ISP level for example?
 I also see that VRRP supports LB which is also interesting. If anyone got any advice to clear up my confusion please let me know, thank you!

                              <span>Hey there, I&#x27;m facing network issues that affect hosts, that connect to the network, for some minutes.
 As soon as a host gets a connection to the network it starts sending out massive multicast / IGMP traffic (Membership report / Leave group 224.0.0.252). This happens for some seconds or even hours until it stops. During all the time the host is unable to communicate to the network as most packets get lost and dont even arrrive their destination.
 This doesnt happen when I simply disable multicast on the host, but this can&#x27;t be the solution here.
 The issue was tested with 2 Windows VMs on a Xen Server cluster running on a FlexCenter. It has a trunked connection to the next (Netgear) switch. There are no VLANs. IGMP Snooping is turned of.The issue also exists on physical Windows clients in the network.
 One line from the wireshark report:
 No. Time Source Destination Prot. Lenght Info31134 926.817456 172.20.11.124 224.0.0.22 IGMPv3 60 Membership Report / Leave group 224.0.0.252
 Did anyone see such a behaviour before? What could cause this?

                              <span>Question: all servers on cloud, any reason to co tinje using a firewall like fortigate or sophos or Palo alto on prem for hq and branch offices? How about replacing the traditional firewall appliances with cloudflare? 
 Our environment: all windows based PCs/laptops with office365 for email and office apps.
 All applications are on the cloud or will be on the cloud by September. 
 Traditionally, we had all on prem servers for apps, db, telephony and moved to cloud last year. Since the app and db servers were on prem , we had fortigate and sophos Firewalls plus xdr etc 
 Cloud team takes care of cloud security. 
 Want to get rid of sophos and fortigates and all that junk because my clients already have their own av xdr etc installed on their PCs

                              <span>Hello ,
 I am cleaning up my companies Datacenter. We have moved from Physical to Virtual from 80 physical machines down to 12. The 7 new servers use fiber with 5 of the legacy machines using 4 ethernet lines each. Currently there appears to be around 300 ethernet cables running about the datacenter would it be worth removing the majority of them and only leaving about 40 since all the new servers we install run off fiber?
 ​
 I am also tasked with replacing the switching infrastructure in the Datacenter in a year from now and want to do this to help me get an accurate estimate on what costs would be instead of buying an exact match to what we currently have.
 ​
 Thank You,

                              <span>Hi Folks,
 4x Cisco Leaf(Nexus) &gt; DellMx7K with ESXi(Virtual switches and hosts running)
 I&#x27;m having an issue where Virtual hosts look to get dropped after a failover test on the virtual switches. Traffic would come into ACI on different ports. I did create a port-security policy to the interfaces with maxium endpoint value of 0 to disable. As per this document.
 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/aci/apic/sw/5-x/security/cisco-apic-security-configuration-guide-50x/m\_port\_security.html 
 Server team say it&#x27;s has improved but not fully. Still some hosts disappearing for a short period after failover. Are there any other configurations I need to implement?
 ​
 This link below mentions disabling DTP and using 802.1q over ISL. I can&#x27;t see where to set this is ACI.

                              <span>I am having an issue with wireless clients showing connected, with all the correct DHCP details, but no internet connection
 Current setup:
 Cisco 3750 switch with 2 VLANs.
 VLAN15, &#x27;MGMT-VLAN&#x27;: 10.97.15.1 /24
 VLAN 100, &#x27;Wireless Clients&#x27;: 10.97.100.1 /24
 I have a Draytek Vigor 2960 connected to the switch via trunk port, Draytek is on IP 10.97.15.254 (VLAN 15)
 Cisco 2500 WLC connected to the switch on VLAN 15, IP address 10.97.15.254
 1 x Cisco AP on VLAN 15, IP address: 10.97.15.100
 Draytek FW is issue DHCP to VLAN 100 clients starting 10.97.100.100 - 210
 Interface and SSID setup and presumably working for wireless clients as I can connect to the SSID and pickup an IP, SM,GW and DNS that I specified on the DHCP server (Draytek)
 I can see clients connecting to the AP with the correct network details fro with the WLC, and I can see the same clients connect on the Draytek DHCP table, but my devices, android mobile and MacBook show connected without internet and Im not sure why.
 My devices can ping each over, i.e 10.97.100.100 can ping 10.97.100.101 and vice-versa but they cannot ping the VLAN gateway on 10.97.100.254 even though they are getting their DHCP details from that device.
 Im a bit stuck as to what could be the issue.... any ideas or able to point me in the right direction would be appreciated
 Thanks

                              <span>Hello guys,
 Just need your opinions for those who have worked with out of band access devices as my work require one for lot of equipment such as routers/switches/firewalls in a data center. We are looking for a cheap alternative device that can be used temporarily on each equipment when doing interventions so it may not require many ports since it will be removed afterwards, maybe 4-8 ports. I did my research, mostly found that opengear models are pretty expensive.
 Opengear ACM7004-2 has 4 serial ports RJ-45, 4 USB ports, RS232 compatibility and is relatively small but price around $800. I found several models like these on their websites but with LTE which i don&#x27;t really need. I was searching for cheaper alternatives. For the Opengear IM4208-2-DDC-X2-G, i don&#x27;t have the price but has 8 ports RJ45/RS232, 1 usbport and has some good security features.
 Lantronix SLB console server has 8 ports and seems ideal but couldn&#x27;t find its price and much specs about it, the SLC 8000 has 16 ports but seems pricey on amazon around $2000.
 The perle IOLAN SDG4 has 4 serial ports RJ45, RS232 local console port but cost around $1000. Surely there has to be a cheaper one.
 Digi CM 8 Console Server 8 Port has 8 RJ45/RS232 ports and 1 console port RJ45/RS232, i don&#x27;t have the price for this one but it does feature auth like tacacs and radius.
 So normally a technician would plug in the console server to an existing switch (depending on the brand of the switch, i will have to preconfigure the OOB device to connect to it) and the equipments will be accessible via the switch. Normally most devices in the data center have RJ45 compatibility. What do you guys recommend using for this scenario or if you have used those i have listed or a variation of it ? Btw i&#x27;ve searched most on amazon but there isn&#x27;t much available. Some websites are genuine but don&#x27;t list the prices which makes it harder. Anyway, let me know what you think.
 Thanks in advance.
