Said customer also hosts similar websites on-prem for testing. They would like to acces the test server without using the vpn. But they also dont wont to open any ports on the server. So a tunnel it is. What would be the best way to tunnel that data? Ideally I would be able to limit acces to certain ips.

 We have an existing 2016 box we are going to retire. It's within one of our own networks in another region. It employs most of the STIG rules. It is domain joined.
 We use this for:
  
Jumping into routers
 Jumping into restricted VMs/Infra
  
With the new host, I have a couple of questions:
  
We're looking to move it to Azure so if anything in our network is compromised, we still have the jumphost for admin functions
 Domain joined or not to be domain joined - just becomes a headache around administering it
  
Any other suggestions you have would be welcomed.

 Do any of you folks have experience with Mojo? How far has it come along since the Arista acquisition?
 I know there are the big players like Aruba and Juniper Mist, but the thought of a cloud vision managed VXLAN campus + wifi is intriguing to me. Arista seems to be the best folks to do it, given their roots in DC networking. 
 PS (I'm not even going to entertain the thought of a N9K ACI fabric or a Cisco DNA campus lol)

However, that produces an error and it will never save because the disk is full. I then go into Recovery Console, and that also does not save the new password because I am assuming the disk is full also.

 I have 2x Dell PowerEdge R740 (just 1 year old) with Seagate HDDs (DL2400mm0159, SAS 10K 2.4TB) with RAID-5 (1 hot spare) configuration.
 Past few months, I've been experiencing multiple disk failures. Since Oct 2022, so far at least 10 disk failures on two different servers. 5 disk failures on each server..
 I replaced disks (when it failed), physically replaced PERC H750 RAID Controller, upgraded firmware of HDD & BIOS as well but disk failure has been happening randomly on different slots and today another one just failed. Dell Tech support says they do not perform any root cause analysis of HDD failure and does not provide me with any reason for this massive failure. 
 Any idea why disks keep failing?

 My company has tens of thousands of photos, dating back decades, scattered across local file servers, SharePoint sites, and Box accounts. After reorganization attempts from several marketing people, it has gotten to the point where people can rarely find the photos they are looking for if they don't already know exactly where to look.
 I'm looking for software that will scan the media in its existing location and build a searchable database based on the file's metadata. Ideally it could use AI to allow users to search for subject matter. I would also like it to allow things like tagging, rating, and favoriting media.
 In my searching, I have come across Digital Asset Management software, but I'm struggling to get my head wrapped around what they actually do. It seems like they are trying to be more of a wholesale replacement for a file share, but I can't really tell.
 Any advice on if software like this exists or on best practices for managing a large media catalogue with multiple users and contributors.

 Until now we didn't do any pc management, imaging, or 'freezing' of the system but it was all done manually trying to keep the computers in working order. But lately (because of our growth and increase in us…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! I’m a new sys admin at our company which is very cloud-focused and we’ll be inheriting an HPE server with Server 2019 and Hyper-V installed with 4 VMs on it. We’ll need to implement our own alerts to let us know if the Hypervisor or any of the VMs go offline. Something to note is that there is a plan in place to migrate these VMs to Azure or shut them down completely if we don’t need them within the next few months. So we’re looking for more of a cheap stopgap than anything. 
 I was thinking of setting up Azure connection monitoring to accomplish this since I see you can also monitor on premise machines. But if there’s something better available that fits this scenario, I will look into it. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm an individual contributor at my organization. A previous manager and I had a conversation once about pursuing a Management position vs remaining an individual contributor (Admin/ Engineer/ developer etc...) position.
 ​
 Basically it boiled down to my manager saying that remaining in technical roles can be more rewarding than going into people management type positions. Siting that high level individual contributors have high salaries than management people. I find this hard to believe. From my perspective, no manager would ever make less than their direct reports because of the mindset "They report to me, I'm high in the org chart, therefore I'm more valuable." 
 ​
 Difference between the roles aside, Is there any truth in this? Can any of the individual contributors out there confidently say their salary is higher than their manager? Was remaining a system admin more lucrative for you? For those that made the switch from an admin to a people manager, do you have direct reports that make more than you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm sure there are many on this sub using these "small business" switches. They're full featured, good value for money, have lifetime warranty and, most importantly, are actually shipping!
 The problem is, when you have about 100 of these switches (mix of SG300, SG350 and the new CBS350 of various sizes and PoE/non-PoE) and they all need pretty much the same configuration save for some special use access ports..... do you guys/gals use any special tools to bulk configure them?
 I've done some crude automation with DHCP Options / TFTP and a gold config file, but once you need to start tweaking the individual switch it all goes manual.
 And please don't ask me to use FindIT, or Cisco Business Dashboard, or PNP, or whatever half-baked tool Cisco decides to stick into these switches... I'd like something where I take a switch out of the box, stick it in the network, it gets autodiscovered then I can configure it and maintain it almost entirely in bulk.
 EDIT 1: I already have the initial config sorted. Like I said I can do it with a golden config file, DHCP Options and TFTP. This is fine. My question is about follow up config changes, monitoring, config backups, and individual port configurations.
 EDIT 2: Basically I’m looking for a “WiFi controller for switches” for these models. Aruba, Ruckus, Cisco Catalyst, Cambium, Meraki - they all have some form of centralised controller… I’m looking for something similar for these switch models.

 Couple this with a form that HR fills out (lol I know, but it's been working pretty well), some dynamic groups to assign licenses and you're on your way to saving the IT department a lot of time spent on setting up accounts and fixing mistakes. 
 I've tried doing this with the 'create user' step in Power Automate, and using PowerShell, this seems to be the most flexible way to do it.

 At this point I'd like to start from scratch and work my way up as I can't even get a simple data VLAN working correctly.
 Here's what I would like to do to start.
 There is a Sonicwall TZ370 firewall (acting as router) and a D-Link DGS-1100 switch. Modem plugs into X1 WAN port on SW. X0 Lan port on SW is plugged into port 1 on switch.
 The main company network is 192.168.1.1
 I would like to create a Data VLAN 20 at 192.168.20.1 which assigns IP address in that range when plugged into port 7 of the switch
 I have create a virtual interface in the Sonicwall (X0:V20) and assigned it 192.168.20.1 and set up a DHCP lease range, 192.168.20.2-254
 In the switch there is a default VLAN0001 with all 24 ports untagged, Native VLAN (PVID) checked, and all ports set to hybrid.
 I created a VLAN 20 Data. Here's where I get confused. What do I set port 7 as? I have tried all options. 
 When I select tagged or untagged, Internet works but I still have 192.168.1.1 address. Not sure what I'm missing.
 Any ideas? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So in the new year I’ve decided I should improve the security for our Veeam Backup infrastructure by deploying a dedicated AD Domain just for the Veeam servers to live on. It got me thinking, should I also move vCenter authentication over to only using this new domain, should I point it to both domains, or should I leave it as it is on the production domain?
 Looking to minimise the chances of lateral movement within the network from bad actors by making sure compromised credentials from the production domain can’t be used to tamper / impact the backups. There’s already a bunch of physical servers acting as repositories / tape servers and a number of VMs acting as proxies and data movers(in addition to the Veeam Management VM), so adding an extra couple VMs hosted on the physical repository servers will maintain the physical separation.

 What I want is for users to log in with their username / password, and then reach over and hit their FIDO key for mfa, as a faster/easier option than pulling out their phone. ..but then you have to put in another PIN, which is complete overkill.
 No point, just a gripe.

Recently started a new work with a much bigger team than my previous job. While discussing with my manager about plans for outages during the holiday, he said he’s not expecting to be able to reach me not anyone. They have a small team dedicated for such outages as first responders. 
 So this holiday has been the most quiet holidays I have had for the past half a decade. No email addressing to me. No server alerts. Nothing. Feel surreal. Gave me time to binge on a few anime I missed.
 With that said. Happy holidays and new year to everyone. For those that have to work, best of luck to you all!

 So I have been thinking of doing a career change to System Administrator or Cloud Engineer/Architect and I'm wondering what my first steps should be. 
 I currently hold a bachelor's in Aerospace Engineering and a master's in Mechanical Engineering. I currently work as a Systems Engineer (not IT Systems Engineer) in the defence sector where I do various work from designing to testing of naval military equipment. I have 2 years of experience after graduation. None of my work experience is related to System Admin or Cloud Engineering. 
 I have done some research and found that I should probably start with some of the certifications listed below: 
 Solutions Architect Associate
 Solutions Architect Pro
 Data Analytics Specialist
 Azure Fundamentals
 ​
 Will getting these certifications be enough to land a job at one of these positions? Should I do anything else to stand out? Any help is greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I recently started looking into roles similar to my own after being with the same company for nearly 15 years. When I was hired 15 years ago I never negotiated (didn't have a lot of experience at the time) so every raise and promotion has been tied to my starting salary. My current salary, senior systems administrator, is $110k which for here in Ohio I've been happy with. However, after looking at very similar roles I'm seeing salaries of $120k - $135k. I don't want to leave the company I work, it's a great place to work, and the benefits are excellent. What's making me look around is simply my salary which I believe may be a bit low considering my experience.
 The company I work for has a process for adjusting salaries based on the job market. I'm not sure how to approach my boss and do this dance. A raise of 20% would put me more in line with what I'm seeing from other job listings. I'm thinking I'll need to bring in evidence to justify the pay raise but I'm not sure what sources would be best to use. Should I even bring a copy of the other job listing that shows the higher pay or would this be a mad move? I could wait to have a more concrete offer but I know that once that card is played you have to be prepared to leave if a counter offer doesn't occur.
 Thank you

 We have had remote users lose network connectivity or lose audio and microphone functionality due to unexpected driver changes for the NICs and audio hardware.
 The fix has been to manually redeploy the working driver to their system. If it’s a network driver for a remote user and they can’t get back online, we have to ship them a replacement laptop and they lose days of work.
 Is there a setting to restrict drivers to the versions were have tested and are deploying?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long time listener first time poster . Sorry in advance if this is not the right sub.
 Background: I have to create a solution for auto certificate enrollment for IoT drives based on a locked version OpenSSL by the vendor. We are their first customer requesting 802.1x for nac port security but don't have a preference on how to automate the enrollment /renewal of certificates. Right now it's a very manual process. We use our own internal CA for laptops/desktops with GPO and AirWatch for company iPhones (6000+). Renewal period maybe 1year,2year or 5 year depending on the intermediate Issuing CA. 
 Does any one have any experience with this? I would also use this we future developments and axis cameras. There would be over 1000 devices to start and would increase over time so must be scalable. 
 Looking for some Pointers, would keyscaler solve this problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Curious to know what tools you're all using for network configuration management in automation. 
 The network I manage is not well connected (mobile units) and as such, many devices can be expected to be offline at one time. I've thought about using Ansible for pushing configuration changes, but given the high probability that a node is offline, I would have to develop intelligence that pushes until successful over an interval. This could get a little finicky. 
 I'm thinking of testing out a pull-based automation platform, but I don't have any experience with them whatsoever. My Ansible experience is limited to laboratory environments. I've used Nornir to backup devices, but again, hit or miss depending on what's online. I schedule this to occur once nightly at a time where I should have a decent success ratio. What would be easier? Having the configurations managed from a central automation platform and having the devices pull that down. 
 I don't yet have a Single Source of Truth developed, but I am working on this. I came into the organization with phpIPAM as our IPAM tool. It doesn't do DCIM very well whatsoever, so I'm wanting to move to something else (Infoblox, Bluecat, or NetBox if they'll let me go FOSS again). Meanwhile, I'm shopping automation platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks,
 I don't know if it's okay to ask this in this subreddit, but since I got a lot of information regarding testing new hard drives from here, I thought I give it a shot.
 I recently purchased two Seagate Expansion Desktops (16 TB each, the one I started testing with is a ST16000NM000J model) and did a little research to check if and how I should test my new storage devices, since I'm new to this whole topic (Windows 10).
 Here is what I came up with: https://pastebin.com/HHXPsEmu 
 If somebody wants to read and / or correct me - be my guest.
 Following my research, I wanted to do a Erase Test with HDDScan on the new drive as a first step, but it immediately started listing bad blocks and doesn't stop to list them (SMART values were all okay) . Now I read on several links (Link1, Link2, Link3), that this probably is a failure of HDDScan. I tried 3 or 4 times, always starting HDDScan as admin, re-assigning the drive since it won't get detected anymore after canceling the Erase Test, turned it on and off again, turned PC on and off again, nothing seems to work. 
 Is my drive just flatout broken, does HDDScan just don't work correctly (what am I doing wrong?), is there a fix to this or what is the problem? 
 Is there any other way of doing a destructive read / write test on Windows to verify my drive, that this community recommends? I heard about badblocks, but I'm not in the mood to set up a Linux virtual machine just for this and I don't want to upgrade to a Windows 11 Developer Build just to get a functioning mount-command for WSL.
 I didn't test it with the other redundancy drive yet, but since this seems to be an error (or at least it seems to me), I did what any regular human being would do - frantically ask some dudes on reddit. I will test the other drive the following days and can update this thread, if necessary. Any help is appreciated <3

 In the cisco corner we have a 3750 with 3 vlans (1,2,20) and in the D-Link corner we have a 1510 with the same vlans configured. Should be simple to connect them, trunk port with 2,20 on the trunk and 1 as native, then on the D-Link side a hybrid port with 1 native untagged and 2 and 20 tagged.
 Nope only vlan that passes traffic is 1 (native), so we abandon that idea and setup an access port for 2 and another for 20,sfill no dice. Only mac address learnt was the port on the dlink.
 Checked the config on the dlink in cli, nothing odd at all really quite basic. Even withy everything broken out into access ports vlan 1 was the only one that passed traffic.
 So, any ideas on this one, as I'm at a bit of a loss how something that should have been simple just failed to work as expected.
 Cheers.

 The password I tried was: Aband0nedFairgr0und 
 This is a a 19 character password with a combination of uppercase/lowercase/numbers (no special characters) 
 I went to 5 different password strength sites and they all give me wildly different results for how long it would take to crack.
 ​
  
 https://www.security.org/how-secure-is-my-password/ 9 quadrillion years 
  
 https://delinea.com/resources/password-strength-checker 36 quadrillion years 
  https://password.kaspersky.com/ 4 months 
  https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/ 1 day 
 
 As you can see the results are all over the place! 
 Can anyone recommend the best/ most upto date resource to check password strength. I am sure people with bitcoin mining farming GPUS can crunch 100s of guesses per second. 
 PS: Dont worry, Aband0nedFairgr0und is not a password I use and was made up as a test.

 I have so far used Chrome Remote Desktop and TeamViewer, but would really like something that is just a process running in the background and neither Chrome Remote Desktop or TeamViewer does this. 
 My criteria is that this must be running in the background, allow unattended access, have a central/cloud based client list (so I don't have to mess with VPN/DNS) and almost most important, be free or offer a free variant for both Windows and macOS.
 I only have two or three computers I need access to from my laptop, and sometimes from my iPhone.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have a good sized DMVPN environment with approximately 100 spokes. One of these locations, happens to be my office.
 My office in this case, has 5 x WAN links, all of which today are VDSL-class 100Mbps lines.
 My ISR's here, are 2951 HSEC+ K9 with the ISM accelerator.
 Performance is satisfactory for 100Mbps circuits, however there are some issues:
  
I am replacing the VDSL links with 3 x Fiber links, each of which is 1Gbps down, 100Mbps up.
 The machines are getting old, and my facility is the only one that must have aes256 tunnels, hence IOS 'up2date' is very important here, the 2951 is now eol.
 If I can cut down on physical equipment I will be happy
  
Downstream of the ISR's (dmvpn spokes) I use ASA5585-X's with WAN traffic zones for load balancing. Each ISR has it's own transit network with it's own /29, and therefore the ASA sees each ISR's downlink as a separate WAN
 All of this today, works very well, I could say that I'm very satisfied.
 However, with the new year coming, I need to make changes to match the new WAN links that are inbound.
 So, my question:
 Is it possible for me to purchase say a modern ASR, link 4, 5, say 6 WAN links to it directly (route to internet direct), and then with that single ASR, join my DMVPN cloud?
 Consider that the single ASR, will have a single serial number, hence a single certificate, and I'm trying to join DMVPN with a single ASR as "multiple spokes"
 The reason for this is that each WAN link needs to be encrypted by way of dmvpn, such that the transit downlink to the ASA is encrypted. The ASA knows only that he sees 4-5 WAN links, which are ultimately DMVPN spokes
 Thank you for any feedback

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been with my current employer for close to 10 years.
 Started as a PC tech and moved up to Sr Admin. It's public sector so the pay isn't great. I'm 60% remote with a 2hr round trip the other days.
 I love the work and the people but I'm at the ceiling, I'm at the last rung of the ladder unless my boss meets a meteor.
 And being local govt things don't change so I'd be looking at the same thing for the next 3-4 years.
 Got called back about a position 15min away. Private sector hospice center. In office for a month then 40% remote. It's not a Sr Admin but would be an increase putting me above what my current director is making.
 My main concerns are:
 They are VMware shop, my experience is with Xen/XCP, Proxmox and Nutanix.
 They are a Cisco shop, my experience is with Avaya/Extreme.
 But they looked at my resume and wanted to schedule an interview ASAP. Fingers crossed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, looking for some help here and can't seem to find the right words to Google it.
 I just finished a web application that requires Google chrome and a specific extension to run. The point of this application is for customers to schedule their own appointments in our system. Boss wants to have a PC set up on location for the customers to utilize this app, so I need to get this PC (that is running normal Win11 Home) locked down.
 What I mean by locked down:
  
The PC should only allow chome to be opened in full screen, and only the application's url allowed. (All other web traffic should be blocked)
 
Users should be unable to launch any other programs (i.e. file explorer, cmd, start menu etc.). Ideally, they wouldn't even be allowed to exit chrome's full screen mode or get back to the desktop
 
Disabling keyboard shortcuts (Win+R, Alt+Tab, Ctrl+Alt+Delete, etc.) 
 
 I'm sure this is a pretty common use case for PC's, so the answer has to exist, but I can't seem to find the right words to Google to start figuring out how to set it up. Just a bunch of chrome troubleshooting. Appreciate any advice or references to articles that would give me a push in the right direction.
 Edit 1: Thank you everyone for reminding me that "Kiosk" is a word. That's definitely what I'm looking for. The limitations by not allowing extensions is bothersome, but I might be able to reconfigure the app for Firefox.

Where do I begin, The machine hosting AD, Radis, IIS, CA & NPS, and so on has access to the office and management VLAN. currently, the APs and NPS are communicating/authenticating over vlan10. since I don't think that ubiquity issues multiple IP's per app on each VLAN.

One location directly has the Radius Server using a Synology NAS and the other site is using Unifi Site to Site VPN (OpenVPN ) Tunnel to connect to the Radius Server to use for Wifi. Is it possible to do this or will they have to forget the network and have to manually connect each time?

 I've been setting up new machines manually up until now - never been a problem as I only needed to build 1 or 2 machines at a time, and in the last year, I've probably set up ~30 devices - but I'd like to start doing it smarter and more consistently.

I then Googled thinking others would have the same question but the only link I found was to guy who asked about the point of active/passive BGP and got a response that explained how there can be a collision if two peers try to form a TCP connection simultaneously... unclear how TCP itself hasn't overcome this but surely this isn't the only reason. If it is, why wouldn't setting active/passive be the norm?

 In a hybrid cloud environment where you have your dedicated connection between the public cloud and on-premises (AWS DirectConnect, Azure ExpressRoute, Oracle FastConnect etc.) and:
  
The dedicated connection is provided by a third party service provider (not listed in the direct partner listing for the cloud provider)
 MACsec is NOT supported on your CPE
 You have to comply PCI-DSS, and you have your non-CDE communicating with your CDE over the dedicated connection
  
Do you encrypt the dedicated connection with IPsec? As in, is it normally required by PCI-DSS auditors in this case?
 P.s. Before anyone asks, no, I do not have contact with the auditors so I can't ask them directly - they will be contracted by my client but that would be a few more months.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Doing some local group auditing and cleanup and noticed a great number of domain user accounts are members of their client device's USERS group. Since a domain-joined device places 'Domain Users' in the local USERS group by default, is there any reason for having the device's primary user's domain account in the local USERS group as well? 
 For example, Sally works for Contoso and is provided a domain-joined Windows 10 laptop named SALLYLAPTOP and account named 'sally@contoso.com'. SALLYLAPTOP's local USERS group has the domain group "Domain Users" in it. Does Sally's individual domain account also need to be in the local USERS group of SALLYLAPTOP? 
 If the answer is NO, and adding the specific user account is just redundant, why do you think so many machines have the user's domain account in their local USERS group? Is Windows doing this by default? If a domain user signs into a domain-joined laptop for the first time, does Windows automatically add the user's domain account to USERS? And is it worth my effort cleaning up all those local USERS groups, removing those individual accounts?

 ​
 I'm actually setting a lab to get some certifications (NSE4/CCNP).
 I actually have one VM ( 8 CPU / 64GB RAM) and running Eve-NG .
 ​
 Until now, everything was working fine. I was able to use Cisco images and FortiVM without anyproblem. 
 ​
 Now I want to test some layer 7 inspection and then I would like to set a Windows VM as a client. I followed the procedure from EVE-NG, everything is ok but when I start client (Windows on QEMU), it is too slow. I can use various ISO ( Win7 /10) the result is always the same. I can install Windows but then it is stuck on "Windows is starting..."
 ​
 I can even set 4 CPU and 8192 MB of RAM for the node, the result is the same...Any idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been having some issues with our sip service over the past few weeks. Occasionally we are not able to dial out. We never have issues with inbound calls. After some additional troubleshooting I found that we were not able to dial out after our sip trunks were idle for some period of time, an inbound call would "fix" the problem and allow us to dial out. 
 I ran a packet capture on a L2 switch in between the SIP trunk provider's SBC & the ISP's router - we see the SIP Invite packets leaving their device but never get a response.
 The SIP Trunk provider states that the issue is they are not receiving those packets. It's about a dozen packets sent to 3 or 4 different WAN addresses. They're stating the the ISP isn't delivering them. 
 I want to call BS on the SIP trunk provider as we've had zero issues with our ISP otherwise. I reached out to the carrier anyways to see if it'd be possible for them to "prove" they are delivering the packets per the sip trunk provider's request. This request seems to be confusing them. 
 Normally I have the ability to just do things myself and figure out who's to blame but this is a new one for me. I tried switching our SIP Trunks over to our backup internet (different ISP) and wasn't able to reproduce the issue but it wasn't a long enough test window that I can say with confidence the issue doesn't occur. 
 Any recommendations on how to proceed?

 With so many damn ways to communicate anymore, how are sysadmins handle all the platforms people are using? At this point I have internal and external colleagues on Teams, Zoom, Slack, Meet, Reddit, and Discord. I tend not to be very active on them half because of them being scattered. 
 Back in the days of IRC there used to be clients to merge all the platforms into one app. Does anything like that exist anymore? RSS feeds? A digest app? A dozen monitors? How do you guys manage it?
 Edit: I'm going to add a little extra context. Our org has "standardized" on four platforms: Teams, Zoom, WebEx, and Slack. Which platform meetings are held depends on the department we're dealing with and how inflexible they are. I try to force all communication through Teams, but it's hit or miss.
 Vendors and other external orgs (e.g ACM slacks) I deal with tend to use Meet, Zoom and Teams. Again, I try to funnel through Teams but our org doesn't do guest accounts and some vendors are stubborn.
 Reddit and Discord is mostly me trying to stay up to date with tech news.

 I'll try and make this a clear without diagrams as possible.
 Currently labbing L3 down to the access layer utilizing OSPF in area 0. Everythings working with each access switch having two equal paths up to the internet. Happy days.
 I've had a play around disabling one of the links on the uplink switch so that only one link is now active. When running a constant ping from a pc on the access switch to 8.8.8.8 I get a loss of 3-4 packets. My understanding was that if both equal paths are in the routing table then theres no convergence and there should no loss.
 I've configured BFD which hasnt resolved. Could this be due to meusing ICMP and EVE NG as a test? Or something along the lines on the routing table not refreshing quick enough?
 I'd like to know your thoughts as this wouldn't be a good scenario within a datacentre

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I'm a new IT Generalist and Internal Facilities Manager.(Our building has their own) I've chosen Snipe-IT for our asset tracking. I'm kind of inheriting a mess and down for making it work. Smaller business, 100 employees. 30k Sq Ft office. Nothing tracked but machines, not even 100%.
 We outsource our helpdesk for now. So I'm looking at asset labels, but until I get that approved I'm just using a label maker. 
 We have several nicer label makers I want to see if I can make work. I still think the laptops needs legit metal tags for durability but in office monitors etc are fine for labels.
 Label makers we have: Zebra ZP 505 Zebra QLn420 Dymo 450 turbo Dymo Letra Tag Brother PT-D400
 Are any of these viable asset tag creaters that would make me not need to order metal/vnyl tags from asset tag.
 As far as asset tracking, I figured these categories were appropriate, pretty much anything over $50 in value. 
 Laptops Desktops Monitors Docking Stations Keyboard Mouse Combo (standard new hire) Keyboards (some are $250) Mouse (some are $100 ) Monitor Mounts? Every person has 2 arms and 2 monitors UPS Units ( So I can track and perform maintenance ) TVs in meeting rooms
 Consumables I understand are toner, office supplies etc.
 So, any of our current label makers be able to be sufficient in a decent quality tag? 
 I'd love to have it say 
 Property Owned by: Name/logo Company 
  123456
 But I need it pretty small. 
 And do those categories look pretty standard. Should I break it down by Individual office desk or just the general office. ( we have 2 suites ) 
 Thanks yall, I didn't see a better sub for this. 
 Also not many great videos on snipe it. I may have to make some.

 Router (1GbE) > Switch 1 (L3, 10GbE) > Switch 2 (L2, 1GbE)
 Using VLAN 1, 50 and 100.
 Our intention is to put a NAS (10GbE) and specific clients (10GbE) on VLAN50, all connected to the Switch 1. I just want to make sure, if we copy files between VLAN50 clients which are all on the same subnet and connected to the Switch 1, will traffic stay with the switch or also pass through the router and bottleneck the 10GbE requirement?
 If traffic does stay with the switch, would you still recommend us offloading the inter-VLAN routing by letting the Switch 1 be the gateway for VLAN50 instead of the router?

 I have a client that was recently infected with ransomware and all their files were encrypted. The worst of it was their MSSQL database with all the data they need to run their business without having to restart from the ground up. Due to not following best practices (Not my fault, I work for the software development company that developed the software that uses the database, not their IT provider) they were hit with the ransomeware. They paid the ransome, got the key and had some other company decrypt the data. 
 We got the unencrypted database MDF and backup files. I'm pretty sure the data is still there but the headers are gone so we are unable to attach or restore the files. I'm not the most savy with SQL so I thought I'd probe the mindhive. 
 Has anyone else had any success recovering SQL databses corrupted by ransomeware? TIA

 I’ve tried playing abound with a spare Cisco ASA in transparent mode, but it got way too complicated as there are several VLANs and IP ranges involved. 
 Functionally I’m thinking about something like a “tap”, but with the ability to export Netflow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When using VRRP to provide layer 3 first hop redundancy for layer 2 switches, is using proxy arp on the VRRP routers enough to ensure that port isolation isn't broken? 
 The uplink ports of the layer 2 switches are connected to the VRRP routers.
 Multiple layer 2 switches will be connected to the VRRP routers. Normally I would put each layer 2 switch in a separate VLAN, but with VRRP this has the downside of wasting a large proportion of public IPv4 addresses in each subnet. Most switches have 24 or 48 port which do not align with subnet sizes.
 IP unnumbered would appear to be a solution to efficient use of IPv4 space, but I can find very little documentation about its use with VRRP. Well, other than information from Arista that it isn't supported:
 https://aristanetworks.force.com/AristaCommunity/s/question/0D52I00007EzQehSAF/unnumbered-ip-interfaces-and-virtual-router
 Does anybody know if other vendors, such as Cisco or Juniper, support VRRP with IP unnumbered?
 Huawei has a concept called super-VLAN, which is similar to IP unnumbered and it supports VRRP. Is this my only choice, other than trusting port isolation and proxy arp or wasting a large percentage of my IPv4 space with subnets and VRRP?

 The PCs are the same, they both are already done with their encryptions, and they show no errors in the MBAM reports.
 ​
 Any ideas...?

This is a good thing but an issue we have just run into is after letting an executive go it was difficult to audit and see if any files were moved, saved, screen shots taken, ect. 
 I am the only IT member in the company for about 40 people in the HQ office. Is there some type of monitoring software or hardware that would give me the ability to see what is being downloaded, anytime an external hard drive is plugged into the machines, and things of that nature. We use laptops not desk tops and dont know if its even possible to do this type of monitoring with laptops. Does Azure have this form of monitoring?
 ​
 thanks for the help as always

 I am looking to implement some external facing load balancers and after some experience from people using these in a corporate environment.
 ​
 My questions are people putting load balancers External to the Firewalls (prior) or have them sat within a DMZ?

 Ultimately I am looking down the Kemp route and moving away from Loadbalancer.org.

 Hey I am currently developing a Shopify store and have found the offers in the app store lacking. 
 Im looking for a warehouse management system that can properly track all of my inventory, meaning that it can tell me where Product A is, e.g Product A is on shelf A.
 Concurrently it should also include an order processing system, which will compile a packing list of all the orders that have been paid for.
 Our old system has these features and it would be nice if there was an App that could do the same.
 I have found a couple companies that provide this externally from shopify, although i am not sure how trustworth they are (sksuvault, skusaavy) They seem to have everything I need, but they are very low key and I cannot find enough data supporting them to be reliable. I am willing to consider external apps that can be integrated into shopify aswell as shopify apps themselves.

 Elon Musk’s orders were clear: Close the data center.
 Early on Christmas Eve, members of the billionaire’s staff flew to Sacramento — the site of one of Twitter’s three main computing storage facilities — to disconnect servers that had kept the social network running smoothly. Some employees were worried that losing those servers could cause problems, but saving money was the priority, according to two people who were familiar with the move but not authorized to talk about it.
 The data center shutdown was one of many drastic steps Mr. Musk has undertaken to stabilize Twitter’s finances. Over the past few weeks, Twitter had stopped paying millions of dollars in rent and services, and Mr. Musk had told his subordinates to renegotiate those agreements or simply end them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So up until recently I worked for one of Fortinet’s competitors, and the general consensus (from our competitive intelligence team) was that Fortinet SD-WAN wasn’t truly up to snuff for a few reasons:
 (1) Supposedly, using ASICs in their hardware (as opposed to general x86 CPUs) means that customers have to rip and replace their appliances to get new functionality… I find this hard to believe, as aren’t their ASICS actually FPGA’s/programmable?
 (2) Lack of a “true” overlay… only VPNs with basic IP SLA’s attached. However… based on what research I’ve done, I don’t really see anything lacking in this area?
 (3) They require switches to sit in front of the appliances for HA… however, I understand that the newer branch models have built-in switches. Is this no longer a requirement?
 What’s your opinion? Was I fed lies / information that was no longer accurate? What’s the consensus on Fortinet SD-WAN?

 One he’s at a country I’ve blocked being able to connect to my VPN so made exception for him. Ticket had CEO CC’d who he is BFF with and had high urgency. 
 Replied to try again and he replied doesn’t work. I ask if I can remote into his machine and he says okay. I use ConnectWise and I’m in. Before I can even start investigating I get disconnected. 
 Try to reconnect and no go. Call him and no answer. I use CW on my office workstation and works fine. Email him to call me back. 
 4 hours later get email VPN still down. He finally calls me from a weird number and goes yeah I still can’t connect. I told him I was disconnected and he’s like yeah I closed the laptop lid to conserve battery. I’m like I called you why didn’t you answer. Oh yeah I jumped in the pool with my phone… I need a new phone. Then he goes don’t worry you can fix issue after New Year. I go you got my email on your phone right? And tell him you don’t need VPN to check email and if you get email on your phone why did you need your laptop. He just says Merry Christmas even tho we’re past it and hangs up. LOL
 Normally I’d be annoyed but it’s slow and my projects are done for year and I’m just studying for my next cert so this was a entertaining distraction of sorts.

The assistant IT director insists this is a safer method than service accounts, but I'm not sure if I agree. My concern is if DHCP reassigns a previously allow-listed address, it would potentially be possible for that device to spoof emails, or at least send emails using whatever domain address they want unauthenticated.
 What are your thoughts? Should I address this with our IT director?

 IDrac shows no hw issues, perc h710 mini shows good health and ran a consistency check with no issues. Virtual disk is selected as boot volume. Single VD, 3-disk raid5. 
 In the bios settings the boot is correctly set to uefi but no bootable devices are detected. 
 If I boot off an iso into Windows recovery I can clearly see the Windows partitions including the efi part and all the files. I also attempted to rebuild the eco boot record from a Dell support article. 
 I’m suspecting a quirky hw failure of the raid card but wanted to check with the community to see if I’m missing anything. Its one of our physical DCs and is redundant so it’s not hurting us, but if I can I would like to repair so I don’t have to do a rebuild.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little about me, 10 years in networking - started with cisco/ASA, moved to a fortinet/meraki/multiple sdwan vendor shop - now back in a meraki/fortinet environment.
 I've dabbled with automation/python here and there, decided I want to really dig deep into automation for 2023 and move into a network automation role. The cisco devnet associate exam caught my eye and I'm really loving it so far...UNTIL it started to get really heavy into the cisco proprietary stuff (DNA,APIC,ACI,NX-OS,CISCO SD-WAN,ISE,UCM,FIREPOWER) UGHHH. I don't have real world experience with any of these products, I've always worked in a mixed vendor environment.
 Would it make sense career wise to just tough it out and learn this stuff with no experience ? or should I just learn all the popular automation frameworks/tools/CICD stuff - work on some projects then apply to jobs ?
 Would this cert give me any leverage vs other folks who apply for the same position ? I don't know what to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The IT manager title might be a bit generous, but I've been overseeing a three man IT team for a mid-sized nonprofit for the past 5 years, and have worked for the company for over 11 in total. My old boss and I built the department from the ground up when I first started there, and I stepped into his role when he left. Like with most small teams, my position wears a lot of hats from management/planning to hands-on sysadmin and tech work.
 Unlike when my old boss left, I don't think anyone internal is capable of filling the role, so while I'm sure the ship will be kept afloat for a while, they're eventually going to have to hire externally. I don't consider myself to be particularly hot shit, but unless they get lucky, they're going to have a hard time finding someone qualified to fill the role for what they're paying. I mostly stuck around as long as I did because of personal investment and the fact I was given freedom to operate and learn, which I value highly. I know their ability to replace me is ultimately not my problem, but I want to do what I feasibly can to make things easier on the guys under me when I leave, especially one who has a lot going on personally at the moment and is unlikely to be able to start job hunting any time soon if things go south.
 I'm giving a three-week notice after new year's. My current plan is to tidy up a couple of existing projects, make sure documentation is all shored up, help with hiring if HR miraculously gets candidates in time, and just generally be a resource until I leave. I might give my boss my contact information to potentially provide services at a contracted rate for emergencies as well, but I'm undecided on that.
 Is there anything else you guys would do specifically in my situation to help ease the turnover for your team?

 1 extra second X minimum 2 times per day X 200 working days per year = 400 seconds (6.6 minutes) X 10,000 employees at a large company = 66,000 minutes (1100 hours, or 46 days = 137 standard 8 hour working days) of employees dismissing the corporate warning message.

I'm using PHP and unsure of how to wrangle the UI for Azure or other systems in order to unblock the PHP code. What do we need to do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After all that flooding in the MDF a few days ago, I've begun planning the hardware replacements. 
 Currently we're all in on Aruba/HP switches, with the occasional Netgear. They work great and I like them (besides the netgears). 
 We had new single mode fiber installed in 2015 and its never been used. We're still on the gigabit multimode stuff. 
 I figured its time to go 10g, we have 240+ 4k IP cams everywhere and they network is pretty much idling at 90% of 1gbps. I've had to start lowering bitrates on cams.
 The firewall is currently an aging SonicWall NSA2600, which I hate. Considering going Fortigate.
 The question is, Should I go Fortiswitch, or stay Aruba? We have about 40 switches. I hear full stack Fortinet is a magical thing.
 Currently the Arubas are managed by CLI/NetDisco. Its great, but NetDisco cant do much beyond identifying devices, and setting the untagged vlan - and I need to break out putty for anything else.
 Also need a Wi-Fi solution, FortiAP? Currently have Ruckus managed by the ISP, but we hate the ISP to the point where we're suing them and will be kicking them out next year. They'll probably take their R710s with them. We'd need about 500 WAPs with PPSK that can guarantee about 300mbps across 900 relatively modern devices.

 We've run into a major production issue with our pair of Dell 4032 switches - they are used as iSCSI for 3 esxi hosts and distribution for other devices. Issue is: out of the blue we lost access to several VMs. 
 Rebooting one of the two restored access, however, the issue keeps coming back and the only fix is a reload. We replaced one of the switches but the problem remains - after 1 day (at most) we lose access to critical VMs and until we reboot the device. There's nothing relevant in the logs (I'll attach the spanning-tree detail and running config). There were no changes made to the environment or configs. besides setting the root bridge ID to a lower value on one of the two (from the default 32768).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there any living person on this Earth that actually disabled NTLM in his environment?
 Not in a lab or something like that, but with real working functioning production services.
 Because, you know, there is a lot of cybersecurity fuss about switching from NTLM to Kerberos and real vulnerabilities.
 I know that for Kerberos you need to be in contact with DC to acquire tickets or use something like KDC proxy and it is not always feasible.
 I know how to audit for NTLM usage on servers or on DC.
 But the question stands: Has anyone actually did disable NTLM in his production environment? How did it go? What’s the caveats?
 I’m thinking that it is possible to disable incoming NTLM authentication traffic only on some of the servers and audit helps here.
 But the main target here is DCs. So, how about disabling incoming NTLM auth only on DCs? And I haven’t seen any success stories on this matter anywhere.
 I’m asking this question in r/sysadmin specifically, because I don’t need any more guides on how to do it, but actually I need some information from people that actually did it and do support these environments afterwards.
 UPD: I'm not talking about disabling NTLMv1 and just forcing NTLMv2. I'm talking about complete disablement of incoming NTLM auth. This GPO for example: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-security-restrict-ntlm-incoming-ntlm-traffic

It's usually just "oh okay, thought you meant something else". 
 I just don't understand it. I'll gladly be the idiot constantly saying I don't exactly know, but I have an idea let me get back to you in a bit. Some people just hammer down concrete facts (to them) even though they are blatantly wrong, and it leads to so much extra wasted time to unravel what's actually going on. There have been times when I straight up trusted coworkers and did something exactly as they or their documentation said and its still wrong lol

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We had a new user that got locked out of her account three days in a row. We'd remotely unlock and provide a temporary password, with a forced reset at first login, and she'd be good to go, but the next day it would be the same silliness again.
 After a few days of this silliness, I walked to her desk and watched her log in. No issues.
 The next day, she couldn't log in again. I walk over, and she tries again, and no issues. She has no idea what's happening and suspects we're messing with her. I assure her that we're not.
 The next day, inevitably, she can't log in again. So I walk over and watch her log in. When she's in, I make her log out and back again. And again. After the third attempt, she's convinced everything is good, so I walk back to my desk, and she's right back there saying it stopped working again. 
 I was irritated by this time, and I asked her to describe exactly what she did after I left.
 "Nothing, I swear! My login only works while you're here!"
 Back at her desk, I watched her type in her password more closely and facepalmed. 
 When we gave her a random password or while I was at her desk, she would look down at her keyboard as she typed, and it worked. But all the other times, she would touch-type her password and instinctively add a space at the end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our company has both internal and external IT support to tackle all of the tasks required from a medium / large organization. A year ago we hired an MSP to help be our "virtual CTO" and were woo'd with promises of stability, future infrastructure projections and 24/7 on-call support.
 All was well for the first six months, but now we are over a year into the relationship and the veil has been lifted. We no longer get the quarterly check-in's with fancy charts and future mapping, the MSP IT team really only have one or two specialists that can work on network issues and complex SQL problems, and worse yet, their "projects" team is a place where tickets and requests go to die unless we babysit the progress.
 We are looking to move to a new MSP that we believe will be able to meet the demands of our company, but until then we are still semi-reliant on our current MSP to handle routine tasks, be on call, etc.I am working to get their knowledgebase of our company extracted for internal documentation in hopes that we can make a smoother transition to a new MSP at a later date. 
 I just want to know what your experience has been with difficult MSP partners, and how to handle them?

 He needs a script that downloads a specific language and sets it as default, configure locale and regional settings. We checked for those things online, and found some long scripts in powershell to configure regional settings and locale (locale is easy), which don't appeal him. I'm just wondering, is there an option to switch regional settings with a single cmdlet or maybe do it programmaticaly in C#? And to download a language package, install it and set it as default?

 Let's compare E3 vs E5.
 I have just few users on E5 and some on E3.
 How does the Defender for office 365 work currently? Does it need only one user licensed or each one needs to be licensed additionally?
 The users with E3 only will not benefit with Defender for Office 365 at all in this case? So no additional scanning of attachments, safe links options and so on?

Ever since we enabled Hybrid AD join in our organisation (or at least I think that is the issue, since I noticed they were gone around that time), most of the users’ machines disappeared from the devices tab under each user. Like we can see their phones for example, but the computer just isn’t there. It’s not a big deal but sometimes it’s the quickest way to find out someone’s machine and I’d like to bring it back for the sake of my own convenience. 
 What I noticed so far is that my own machine, that is not available to look up in my user devices page, its Join Type is Hybrid Azure AD Joined; MDM: None Then I looked up my boss machine, that one is actually available under his Devices tab and what differs is his machine’s Join Type is Azure AD registered, MDM also says none. 
 Could you guys help me fix this and bring all the users devices available under their respective Devices tab. Let me know if any logs/screenshots/etc is needed 
 Cheers and happy happy holidays!

 User contacts helpdesk. Helpdesk tech joins a teams meeting. Install. Admin Credential Prompt. Login by tech. Proceed. Next install. Repeat.
 Except at some point, user opens a command prompt for one of the installs and doesn't close it, just minimizes. Session ends.
 User now has an admin command prompt. lusrmgr.msc and they can grant local admin rights to themselves. Undoes everything regarding restrictions on local installs.
 Is this just failure by the user for obviously trying to slip by processes? Or failure of the tech to make sure they watched what they signed in for? Or failure of some larger approach that makes something like this impossible?
 What would you put in place to make it so that a user with an admin command prompt couldn't grant local admin rights? Or is this basically past the point of no return and the only thing you can do is make sure the tech watches what they login for?
 Granted. User's actions are trying to bypass the rules. I'm more curious what can stop this beyond better trained helpdesk tech's.

 I'm trying to setup a fortigate box with 4 VDOMs where each VDOM needs to access the internet with it's own IP address.
 I've used a Fortinet guide to setup the VDOMs and have the root do the WAN stuff so each VDOM only knows about it's own network and forward the rest to the root.
 Everything works but I can't figure out how to use a different IP for each VDOM's WAN.
 I have a /29 subnet so I have enough IPs but I can't find a way to set a different IP since my WAN port has a way to only set one IP for it.
 Any help is blessed!
 Thanks

 Some time ago, we hired a new SysAdmin to alleviate the metric f*** ton of work I was doing. Today, I still mostly do the same amount of work. It's been nearly 6 months, and not much has changed. In fact, this jack has often led to more work for me - perhaps because I care too much - and is sheltered by management time and time again.
 Everyone f\*** up, right?*
 So, fast forward to month 3 of them being here. The time comes for an update to our Microsoft licensing. We decide on a migration to a higher tier of licensing - fantastic, I get new tools to employ (MDE, Azure P2, etc). During this process, I was largely absent as I was on PTO after an extended period of not taking PTO (for almost over a year). Come back to find that they failed to consider the other l…]]></summary>

 Someone pulled the drives out of it. I suspect for “security” reasons.

 Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been thinking about a long held tenet of IT administration in the context administrative accounts.
 It’s good practice to have administrative accounts separate to day to day accounts, and only to use them for administrative tasks, but as an extension of that I wanted to find out if anyone had gone even further than segregation of activity by account and actually denied local logon in a windows centric network to admin accounts for administrative functions, relying solely on elevation where required.
 This would include servers and clients; currently my team and myself, login using our admin account to perform admin functions, I’m thinking of changing our governance on that to enforce login using standard accounts with elevation using admin credentials within the standard login required for changes.
 My thinking is that this will reduce the opportunities for misconfiguration by imposing an administrative control whilst simultaneously reducing admin account chatter in our siem logs for more focused reporting and alerting on admin activities.
 Interested in what the community thinks or does already.
 Cheers

 It's Friday December 30th, and you're wrapping up for the day in anticipation for the New Year's holiday weekend. You've got outstanding infrastructure changes to commit but can't decide if they should be postponed until the next business day, so you think "fuck it" and slap Enter. The loading bar crawls to completion and the rest is history.
 A day has passed and all seems fine. You're headed to your parent's place to kickstart the holidays and as far as you're concerned, the back-end changes were steadily applied the day prior.
 Your automated IT monitoring solution alerts you about a vague error, but you've just arrived at Ma's house so you figure you'll deal with it later. Before you can stuff your mouth full of spanakopita, your phone's ringing off the hook: it's your <insert scary C-Suite executive here>, screeching at the top of their lungs about a critical revenue-impacting service being down.
 You know how this goes. 
 You've abandoned your poor partner with woke Uncle Ross spouting mercury in microwave theories at the dinner table, while you troubleshoot issues from your parent's dialup internet in your childhood bedroom. The stuffed animals judging you from afar because you couldn't save yourself the heartache by implementing a change management freeze 'till 2023.
 For the sake of your vacation, your peers, your family, your partner, and your sanity, don't hit Enter.
 Happy Holidays and Happy New Year to all, and thank you for keeping this sub dope. <3

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Murphy's law got me... I was doing some maintenance before a holiday, and one of the steps was rebooting my core switch, an Aruba CX 6405.
 I rebooted it remotely of course, and noticed it was taking a VERY LONG time for the network to come back online. So I go to the datacenter and see an angry red fault light blinking, along with slot 3 blinking red. The card that has failed is a 48-port smart rate poe card with 4 50g sfp56 ports, part number R0X41A.
 In the logs, I found this information:  Message Event|3207|LOG_ERR|AMM|1/1|Line module 1/3 has failed: Internal error Severity Critical (Priority: 3) Syslog ID hpe-cardd Source Time 12/28/22 21:44:38 (1672281878338489) Sequence # 630,332,193 
 My Google skills are failing me here... I find that event 3207 mentioned in a few documents, but they don't give any troubleshooting steps. I have opened a ticket with ASP, but they can't even tell me when an engineer will call at this point.
 Any ideas what I can do to troubleshoot? Here's what I've tried so far:
  
Reboot again, crossing fingers and toes
 Reseat the card in its slot
 Upgrade to the latest firmware published at ASP
 Allowed the switch to perform an "unsafe update" on non-redundant modules (it asked to do this)

 I ask because we are a Cisco Shop. But most of our team in the last few years has retired. We have a 50/50 split and I've been tasked with looking at alternatives for our refresh. We are looking to replace all of our switches to Cisco 9K with ISE (We have), DNA(We have) and NetBox. We're going to be running an "SDN Fabric" for our refresh. 
 I'm looking at Juniper and Arista right now. I really don't care what we run. I really just want the best thing possible WITHOUT being overly complicated.

 Its just blocked and removed another false positive 7Zip! Surely main and well known apps such as 7Zip should be in its own database as safe. And why does it wait for it to run before deciding its "a threat". I was using 7Zip to unpack a package so SentinelOne has now quarantined all 3388 files :)
 It was using its "Behavioral AI" engine which is increasingly appearing to be shit.
 I now specifically put in an exclusion for
 C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7zFM.exe
 And it accepts it but says "This exclusion is not recommended". Really? Where how else am I suppose to stop you deleting 7-Zip file manager.

Wasabi does not support 3d-secure payment with visa cards, meaning European companies are left without practical ways to pay. Therefore Wasabi first asks to disable 3D-secure (which is not possible), then shut off these customers.
 That's an absurd way to lose customers, pushing them to other service providers. Fine for me, good alternatives exist.
 From the customer support :
 Hi xxx,
 I did just take a look at the conversation that you had with my Colleague XXXXXX, all of this was correct. At this time, the Wasabi Console does not have support for Credit Cards the require use of 3D-secure/OTP type authentication. If you do not have another type of card, your account will eventually be deleted form the system due to payment issues.

 Scenario: 
 I host a client's (C1) server in my datacenter. C1 is working with a vendor (V1) to have (site to site) VPN connectivity for V1's services. 
 V1 provides their peer gateway - I already have this peer configured for a tunnel for another client (C2). 
 V1 refuses to modify VPN to include C1 (already containing C2) (security policy), they won't provide any other peer, I don't have an additional peer to provide. C1 has already paid for V1's services, signed contract, etc. 
 I know this is a very dumbed-down scenario, but I have no clue how to even start tackling this. I don't have any access to C1's network. I do have a VPN set up from my datacenter to C1. 
 Could I get some assistance, something pointing me in at least a "starter" direction?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[we have a small IT team but a large pool of responsibilities. I manage the cell phones in regards to setting them up with company software and just making sure they work. 
 Twice now accounting has missed bills and had our service shut off. However since all the users know that I touch all the phones they come to me. So its been fun seeing 85 percent of our phones suspended this morning. 
 Any idea about the best way to handle this? It's easy for the users to blame IT cause they don't have a full grasp of what we do. But Acct should really be in the hot seat imo.

 Setup:
 The company needed a new phone system – bad. They had run out of lines and had started giving IP phones that had no extensions to people. Me, having just started 6 months ago was the prime target for this new project. Not only was I interested in it, but I volunteered, so the job was mine.
 The project was to encompass a few areas. Not only did the company need a new phone system, but after my newbie eyes had looked at their network, I insisted that they redesign it. They had no core switch, and switches were daisy chained so that a single switch failure could take down half (or more) of the company. After showing a report to my ma…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has been my experience that without an IGMP Snooping Querier on the network, multicast traffic effectively flows like a network broadcast within a VLAN (broadcast domain) and will hit every attached node. 
 When you have an IGMP Snooping Querier (like a gateway that is configured to support it) then the IGMP messages flow correctly and IGMP Snooping on the switch-side, which is typically enabled by default, has something to work with and properly filters outbound ports that aren't joined to the IGMP group. 
 This is likely an over-engineering rabbit hole, but for networks that you don't expect to actually do multicast routing - do you still enable an IGMP Snooping Querier somewhere on the network? That way things like SSDP stay within their boundaries (239.255.255.250:1900)? Although thinking further, the other chatty protocol - mDNS/bonjour uses 224.0.0.251 which is link-local multicast and from my experience doesn't get "snooped". 
 From some PCAPs I did see that Meraki has the layer 2 switch Querier feature enabled by default.
 Just curious if this is something others think about enabling.

Currently we are using ISE as our radius server to authenticate the users to login for their anyconnect VPN clients. ISE is looking at a IPA server and making sure the users are in the employee group and then says they are good to go. I would like to make a new "connection profile" I think where if i have users in a non-employee group, they get put into a different profile with a completely different IP pool so I can put an ACL on their subnet and control them. I don't know how to do that and I don't know if I am using the correct terms to google for instructions. Can anyone tell me if I am using the correct terms and if not, what would be the correct things to google?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m wondering if the following setup is even possible to deploy. If so, what would I need to accomplish it, and if not, what would be the best way to achieve similar results.
 I want to have two lines with two different ISPs, and a VPS with a BGP session. Then, I would make a GRE tunnel to the VPS through each line and bond the two tunnels. Finally, I would go out to the Internet through the VPS’s own connection and using an IP range from an AS of my own, announced with the VPS’s BGP session.
 The objectives to accomplish here are mainly three, from the most important to the least:
  
Using my ASN. ISPs where I live charge extremely high prices for a line that allows you to use BGP, so I can save a big chunk of money here.
 
Redundancy. There’s why I want two lines with two ISPs, instead of two lines with the same ISP or even a single line.
 
Increased throughput. That’s why I want to do bonding instead of load balancing.
 
 The real question is: what do I need in terms of hardware and software?

 A machine at work was being bitlocked and the user that sits at the desk decided to restart the machine, even after being explicitly told not to do so by one of our technicians. Now the HDD in question has failed. Under Disk Management it shows the HDD is not initialized however, it fails to initialize and shows the error message "Initialize disk failed due to fatal device hardware error".
 Wondering if this has happened to anyone else and how you were able to resolve the matter and bring the drive back to life (if at all possible)?

 Edit: Thank you everyone for your insight, I am not the most familiar with Bitlocker and all of you have been very helpful.

Though I could be wrong - I swear it wasn't there before, as I was recently around that area quite a bit to inspect a sidewalk install. It doesn't connect to anything inside or outside the box - but it comes out through the pipe that the fiber has been run through and is coiled 6-7 times around the last bit of the insulated portion of the fiber cable. The gauge is way to small to be a pull wire and also appears to be way too small to be any type of ground wire. I've seen this type of wire used for signals before, but I can't imagine what it would be used for. Gallery Here (three images)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have multiple DCs in different locations for our company. We have a primary Domain Controller. On every DC, we have a constant barrage of event ID 4412 in Event Viewer, saying there is a conflict between files and the losing one is sent to the ConflictAndDeleted folder. I can’t figure out why this is happening. Files replicate correctly, but any file in the sysvol directory is subject to this error and having the copy deleted. I used procmon to see what files were being accessed. Files are being accessed by DFS service. I think it causes the service to think there was a change, and the 4412 event happens. We had nearly 1,000,000 files taking up 120GB before we realized what was happening. The ConflictAndDeleted folder on every server is slowly filing up, ignoring the limit I put on each CAndD folder in ADSI.
 When the DFS Replication service is turned off, obviously nothing happens. But when it's turned on, files will disappear from the folder, only to come right back a second later. The folder will have 8 items in it, then 7, then 8, and all I'm doing is sitting there watching.
 I've spent days on this, trying every article I can find. We have CyberArk and Commvault on the DCs. It might be the archive bit being changed by Commvault, but it's happening dozens of times a second, with the same files, and only in the sysvol folder.
 Thoughts?

 This was their answer as for why
 " Dynamic disks have been deprecated from Windows and we don't recommend using them anymore. Instead, we recommend using basic disks or using the newer Storage Spaces technology when you want to pool disks together into larger volumes. If you want to mirror the volume from which Windows boots, you might want to use a hardware RAID controller, such as the one included on many motherboards. "
 why, just why? despite the fact almost all of OEM images already burned w i t h l i c a n s e on a dynamic disk...
 "oh you want to get the latest build? either you remove all of your data and convert to basic or pay for a 3rd party software like aomei to convert for you." Sorry for the rant but this is just stupid

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About 11 years ago was when I had my first desk job, having moved from being a field contractor for Dell to a nice office as a Network/Asset Admin.
 After a short contract, I was offered said position at a software company specializing in data analytics/scraping.
 My entire life, I thought that anyone who could code or script was already at the absolute top of the food chain. Had already been there, done that, been through hell desk, and data centers!
 Boy! That Network Administrator position turned into Senior Hand Holder of the Dev Department.
 I was wrong. Very wrong.
 For years after, I continued to think the same of my fellow various admin’s I worked with. Everyone must just be better than me, I don’t know anything.
 Soon, I will be 30. Young-ish I suppose. But I’ve at least learned that we each have our skills. Whether that’s more, or less… 
 Even if someone appears as a prodigy, you can teach them something, many something’s perhaps.
 What did you believe, and when did that change?

Instead he left the thing in his vehicle in the freezing cold for three weeks while he went on vacation. 
 Gig2 One of office staff in another company decided it was okay for him to share his admin accounts with his son to fix technical issues for him while he disappeared for a week. When I told the so "called IT director" response was I don't who runs the IT as long as the issues get resolved
 Gig3 Company text me share everyone's office365 with everyone and also turn off MFA ."really .... Annoys me when we can't access each other's emails while people on vacation"
 Sorry i worked lots of interesting it gigs for interesting companies. 
 Bonus holiday one Recruiter/account manager calls me for an backfill. When i got there big message on the door we closed.for the holidays till Jan 3 2022 no one here to open door. I sent pics, email etc. Recruiter says it's okay you must work there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Problem: I have a bunch of users that work on desktops, but depending on the day, they log into different desktops (think lab users, secretaries etc).
 They want their user data synced between the desktops, and importantly also their bookmarks.
 For the user data I would use folder redirection, it seems the most straight forward as these desktops are always online and in the domain, they are never moved off the domain so folder redirection should work very well.
 But unless I am mistaking, this cannot sync bookmarks of chrome, firefox and edge, can it?
 For the bookmarks I have been looking at roaming profiles, but this seems to not be recommended anymore as it often creates problems. I have found scripts that would make roaming profiles work with chrome and firefox bookmarks though, so it seems like a viable option.
 Is user profile disks an option here? I know it's designed for RDS, which is not the use case here, but rather profiles on local desktops within the domains. We don't have an RDS farm and would prefer not to set one up if it's not needed (due to licensing etc).
 Assuming user profile disks is a good option here, would it be best to combine it with folder redirection for all the 'standard' files (as it would likely reduce the size of the disk) or is it better to go with just 1 solution to keep it simple?
 Perhaps FSLogix is a solution here as well? To be combined with folder redirection or on its own?
 Thanks in advance!

Can't find the answer. - Anydesk looks really simple to use but I'm concerned about security - Ultraviewer looks nice but maybe sketchy ? - Quick Assist look actually nice but it seems that it will be dead in 2023, and younorobably have to have a Microsoft account ?

Our company employs around 70-80 employees who are using mobile devices for their everyday work. 35 of them are using Windows laptops, 4 are using MacBooks and the rest 30-40 Field Service Agents are using Android Smartphones. 
 During Covid, we changed our IT infrastructure to a cloud-based one with ZOHO. We migrated from our custom-made onsite apps made on Visual Basic to ZOHO's Creator Platform. So far, it has been 2 years and with many ups and downs, we have finally made it to a somewhat smooth transition. Now back to my main question. As many of our employees are sometimes working from home and sometimes from the office, it becomes tricky to manage our devices. This includes windows updates, monitoring for any malware, system monitoring, etc. Is there any cloud-based tool that can help us monitor our devices.
 About me: I do not have an IT background but have to some extent knowledge of how things work. ;)

 In the company I work for, some processes still proceed with paper documents.
 For example, if someone from the company is going out by car,
 We have a draft.
 He writes in this draft which vehicle he will go out, where he will go, for what reason he will go out, and he has his manager sign it. The manager then sends the paper to the relevant manager for approval.
 It's a no-nonsense thing.
 What is the most practical way to solve this process in the computer environment? Is there an open source web service you can recommend? I would like to use it on my local server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 We’re in the market for a new NGFW for our office. Just over 10 users but we host a variety of applications on our server at the office. 
 We currently have a Sophos XG and it’s ok, but I’m beginning to hate Sophos. I don’t know why we went down that path, it’s GUI is clunky, it doesn’t have mDNS (we do a lot of audio visual so it’s handy to have) and today we had to reboot the damn thing because it simply just decided to stop working. 
 We currently have a proxy on our server to handle all the request to different applications from our single public IP. Would be good to move that to the device but not a biggie.
 Our internet speed is 500/500.
 Security is a big thing, I regularly see palo being recommended here, forti too.
 I personally see watchguard, palo and Cisco in the field.
 A apart of me doesn’t want to spend a bunch of money but I know if it’s spent in the right area, I won’t have to think about it again. 
 Saw a silver peak device not long ago but it looks like they only do SD-WAN and not actual firewalling? We’re an Aruba house in central so would tie in nicely.
 We also use the connect VPN from Sophos, it’s good but average too. So anything with a “good” VPN is preferred.
 Open to all thoughts, ask as many questions to help best understand our requirement.

They don't have a dedicated IT department and our manager wants us to export the mailbox from their environment and import it into ours, which is Exchange 2013 on-prem.
 Now this would be simple if the size was manageable but it's not and we're trying to avoid .pst corruption and not interested in using any 3rd party apps. I've searched the web, this sub and a few other forums and the consensus is to break the export down into smaller .pst files by either date or folders. Which seems fairly straight forward but I figure I'd ask the experts to see if that's it or if anyone has input on any other workable options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[from the dhcp rfc:
  
Note that, in some network architectures (e.g., internets with more than one IP subnet assigned to a physical network segment), it may be the case that the DHCP client should be assigned an address from a different subnet than the address recorded in 'giaddr'. Thus, DHCP does not require that the client be assigned as address from the subnet in 'giaddr'. A server is free to choose some other subnet, and it is beyond the scope of the DHCP specification to describe ways in which the assigned IP address might be chosen.
  
Imagine a relay receives a DHCPDISCOVER on interface eth0 with address 192.168.1.1, then it forwards it to the dhcp server at 192.168.0.1, now because it's not required to give an address on the 192.168.1.0 subnet, it gives an address on the 192.168.0.0 subnet, how is this acceptable?
 ​
 Then another host on the 0.0 subnet would arp for the client, but the client wouldnt receive the arp broadcast since they are not on the same physical subnet.

The DMZ switches have reached EOL, and our network is small enough to handle the extra traffic load put onto the Core switch. Now back when I took my CCNA, I got the impression that the DMZ switch was supposed to be a separate switch, but my coworker, who has way more experience than me, says that in his experience they're integrated into the core.
 That being said, I'm trying to wrap my head around how the integration would work. I am thinking it's a case of directing incoming traffic from the ISP switches via VLANs to our firewall, before the firewall allows the traffic onto the core switch?

 - Install Antivirus
 - Install Google Drive
 - Setup Desktop Backup
 - Add to asset inventory

 What software are you guys using for ongoing auditing & documenting of SDLC, change management systems and is there a general starting point for a baseline to work with?
 Would like it to integrate with AD, G-Suite & some 3rd party apps if that is possible. Curious to see what is out there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something I see with disappointing regularity in the sysadmin subreddit, and to a lesser extent in professional life, is criticism of the "previous sysadmin". That voiceless, anonymous entity who wasn't doing backups properly, left AD in a mess, let some critical server support contracts expire...which our intrepid hero swoops in to fix with a theatrical sigh. "Just another day single-handedly keeping this company afloat...what would they do without me?"
 Besides being a cheap vehicle for self praise and narcissism, they don't seem to consider how "their" network might similarly be judged by any new sysadmin taking their position. Suspending their disbelief for a moment that anybody could possibly take over their very important and utterly unique network, they'd likely find the new sysadmin would have no problem digging out incorrect configurations, design mistakes, oversights, skeletons in the wiring closet etc. 
 Because we all have them. Every network big and small. And what we all also share are budget constraints, time pressures, staff shortages, bad management, lazy colleagues. Take these into account next time you're going to shit on the work of the previous sysadmin, especially if you don't know them personally, because I can guarantee you the next sysadmin will equally be able to shit on your work too. It's very easy to disregard the good work done and focus on the "bad".
 I just need to remind myself every time I read a comment from somebody "fixing the mess left by the previous sysadmin" that they're likely inexperienced, lack exposure to multiple networks, and desperate to display competence to their peers. I was like this too in my first few years in IT, so quick to pick out mistakes to disparage "the last guy". Now, with some experience behind me, I find myself giving them the benefit of the doubt, realise that whoever set it up this way may have had extraneous factors going against them, and could probably explain if they were there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been looking for a new job for a while now. Around the beginning of November, I got a hit from a small digital design company looking to bring on their first dedicated IT SysAdmin/Help desk person. Their Lead designer has been their acting IT person and the job has become so much that he's not able to do any design work. I have gone through two interview rounds with them as of December 16th and they just scheduled what I presume to be the final interview for January 13th.
 Enter job number two, an international industrial software dev. I applied to this job at the beginning of December, and they got back to me a few days later. I had an initial call with the recruiter. A week later, on December 20th, I had my second interview with one of their two IT personnel. He liked me and I let him know at the end of the interview that I had already done two rounds with the first company and was expecting the third and final round around the beginning of January. He thanked me and said that changes their interview schedule a bit. The next morning, I got an email to schedule the interview with their director of IT on the 22nd. This morning (27th) I got an email that they want to schedule a call for tomorrow to talk about final steps. I presume this means an offer because the recruiter told me both people I interviewed with had positive things to say.
 So, we get to my situation. Do I send an email off to the first company to see about getting the interview moved up to maybe January 3rd if possible? I would like to have two offers to mull over rather than getting an offer and either waiting to accept, or accepting, only to get a better offer and have to rescind my acceptance from the second company?
 Edit: ok, an email has been sent. Now we wait to see what happens.

 381 7.286147 [impacted resource DMZ IP] [external IP of something outside our network] TCP 68 [TCP Port numbers reused] 443 → 53905 [SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=8190 Len=0 MSS=1460 WS=256 SACK_PERM 382 7.286170 [troublesome box IP] [impacted resource DMZ IP] ICMP 96 Destination unreachable (Port unreachable)
 Where packet 382 contains the source and destination IPs from packet 381. It's like the troublesome box sees packet 381, encapsulates it, and sends it back to the impacted resource, but gets a destination unreachable. It's not doing this to all other IPs in the DMZ either, just two of them.
 Another example of the trouble box showing up after a regular ICMP
 349 6.621700 [impacted resource DMZ IP] [some external IP] ICMP 62 Echo (ping) reply id=0x0004, seq=8403/54048, ttl=255 350 6.621737 [troublesom box IP] [impacted resource DMZ IP] ICMP 80 Destination unreachable (Port unreachable)
 And packet 350 contains this under the ICMP portion of its packet: Internet Protocol Version 4, Src: [impacted resource DMZ IP], Dst: [some external IP]
 Anyone have any idea what this thing is doing?

 Comparing on a machine that's fine it's transferring with no issues and the packet lengths are like 20k, 30k etc, pretty large.

 Pretty sure it's something to do with window size or mss but I'm not super familiar with troubleshooting these.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I've got a peculiar problem that I have not been able to resolve on my own. Google does not give any good results and none of the suggestions I've tried seems to help. This is a hybrid O365 enviroment, all affected users have been transfered to O365 a long time ago, problem started about 2-3 months ago.
 The problem is that some users (about a dozen or so) randomly loose the ability to send emails ie the email is not sent but stays in the Outbox folder. Only solution so far is to remove the email profile on the affected computer and create a new profile. That helps a week or so before the problem pops up again for the user.
 When the user is unable to send email I can not open the users email settings from Outlook or from the Control Panel/Mail. Nothing hapens when I try to open "Email Accounts...".
 The obvious Send/Receive manually does nothing. Outlook is online and new email arrive without problem. I've tried to reimage the computer, sfc /sannow (yes, I'm desperate), reinstall Office O365, start Outlook in safemode, resetnavpane etc etc. My google foo have not given me any good match nor solution to my problem.

 Earlier this year I joined a new company where I am now the sole IT and there are things with which I am still unexperienced. 
 In this case, we run an on-prem exchange 2019 and clients can send and receive autodiscover request, however it asks for the server type (like here) and I just couldn't find if this is normal or if the autodiscover is faulty. I have seen nowhere any clue if autodiscover should provide what type of server you are connecting or not, but my instinct tells me that the autodiscover answer from the server should provide that.
 Anyone knows where to look at to send that to clients when they do an autodiscover ? 
 I have extensively tried the tools to test Autodiscover, and it says my settings are correct, however it doesn't say where this setting is supposed to be, if it actually exists.

 Is there any possibility to save the credentials or is it just not possible by design? It drives me crazy that I cant use WAC because of that.
 Thank you in advance.

Plan is to migrate mails from on-prem exchange 2013 (1 server) to Microsoft365 and then get rid off on-prem exchange server, but keep on prem ad server, sql server, legacy apps, SSO (same password for mail, pc). So we want to have some kind of hybrid environment with mails being in a cloud. We dont want to reconfigure all computers (or at least amount of time if it has to be), have at least amount of downtime.
 Reading MS pages and articles online gave me some info that minimal hybrid migration would be an option. But still there will need to be on prem exchange server to manage users? Are there any solutions to this to get rid of old server or have a newer exchange version on a VM just for management? Also i dont quite understand the line from MS article "Do not plan to continue to run directory synchronization to manage your users"? Isnt this hybrid migration?
 Is there a more suitable migration path for this case?
 TLDR version, plan is to get mail in a cloud, get rid off old exchange 2013 server and manage mails on exchange online. Infrastructure remain on prem. What is the most suitable option.

We can set the number of licenses needed and additional users will be locked out, thus preventing compliance issues. Shit bag Autodesk is asking us to purchase 5 3-yr civil 3D licenses to come to compliance, they claim our 2 user subscriptions had additional install/session more than the number of licenses. We asked them to reduce the demand , as those licenses will sit idle and be a waste since we don’t use civil 3D much. They looped in their attorney, and we asked them to communicate with our legal as well. they started to increase their threats, saying there will be a 25% additional penalty if we involve legal. Is this even legal? They are retaliating if wanted our attorney to communicate with them on our behalf? We never threatened litigation or lawsuits, and only asked for our lawyer to handle communication with them as We are too busy to keep discussing it with them. They know we are valid customers, as we spend $40k+ per year on their ridiculously expensive innovyze software, which they recently acquired to add to their monopoly. Any suggestion to responding to Autodesk, when they threatens to add additional penalties to talk to our legal? We paid them the stupid 5 licenses, at this point it sounds like they like to retaliate and have their customers bend over. Funny thing is we have alternatives, unlike architects who are dependent on Revit, etc. In three years we will move towards an Autodesk free environment.

 I spend the last 1.5 years working from home, using my personal desktop computer (PC). There were several things I had to install, to let me clock in & to connect to their phone system & network. One of the things was called SentinelOne; we were only told that it was for security/malware protection, since we would have access to a lot of sensitive information; made sense, since several hacks/breaches had been in the news around that time.
 It ended up blocking my PC's internet access, except for the program itself, so that it could continue running (can't close it, 24/7) & sending regular screenshots & reports (every 4 hours). Took a ridiculous amount of time, but finally managed to make them remove it (couldn't uninstall it myself, though I'm the administrator).

        <updated>2022-12-27T04:17:38.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I've noticed a lot of threads regarding Password Managers. Since this place has helped me grow in the last 5 years, I'd like to contribute to the community.
 Today, I've put together a How-To guide on deploying a self-hosted BitWarden instance. The guide will go over the following:
  
How-To Create the Virtual Machine
 How-To Install the Operating System
 How-To Configure the Operating System
 How-To Install BitWarden
 How-To Automate the Maintenance for BitWarden
 (Later) Admin Training Documentation
 (Later) User Training Documentation
  
To see the entire list of high-level steps for this How-To, please view the overview page here: BitWarden Self-Host Installation Overview - GitHub
 The guide is broken into 4 Chapters (5 & 6 will be made when I have time tomorrow):
  
Chapter 1: Deploy Virtual Machine: Chapter 1: Deploy Virtual Machine - Github
 Chapter 2: Operating System Setup: Chapter 2: OS Setup - Github
 Chapter 3: BitWarden Application Setup: Chapter 3: BitWarden Setup - Github
 Chapter 4: BitWarden Automated Maintenance: Chapter 4: Automated Maintenance - Github
 (Hopefully tomorrow) Chapter 5: Admin Training Documentation
 (Hopefully tomorrow) Chapter 6: User Training Documentation
  
Chapter 1 & 2 will more than likely be skipped by many of you, but it was created to show the entire process from start to finish.
 In Chapter 4, I go through on how to automate the maintenance. The PowerShell scripts do NOT have email notification enabled by default. If you have your own email functions, you can swap in your function with the one in the script and uncomment the Send-Email lines within the script(s).
 Please leave your suggestions on what I should add, remove, or change. The scripts can definitely be updated (e.g., creating a PowerShell module would be a good start).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working on this Service Desk for 14 months. It was great experience and I learned a lot from teammates and a kind engineer on the systems team.
 When hired, I was told there were possibilities for growth etc. At the time I had some college experience and a couple months in helpdesk, so it was an amazing position for me. 
 The manager of the systems team publicly stated multiple times that he wanted me on his team and I should get training to move over. That was 5 months ago. I got my AZ-900 and constantly asked for permissions to take over more work. I was only ever given permissions to do a task after a month of begging to do more. 
 I got a job offer for a Jr. sysadmin position with a significant pay raise. They are aware of my limited experience, but liked my attitude. I gave my old position one chance to match and all I got was a job description of an "associate engineer" without my name, the date, anybody's signature, pay was verbal, and no effective date. No thanks 
 I'm looking forward to escaping the out of the SD for obvious reasons, but expect to come across an entirely different set of issues lol. I was the glue that held that team together, and I know for a fact that two people will be leaving right after me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a software engineer by trade, now a manager of software engineers. Three years ago my company (around 100 people) had an IT Director, A VP of Technology and an Assistant IT Director. The VP of Technology moved on. Then the IT Director moved on and the assistant was elevated and finally he left a little over a year ago.
 Recently my company asked me to be Director of IT and I said no. I got a look at what all needed to be done, our security needs, etc. and decided it was too much for one person and not what I wanted to be doing, so I said they should hire someone and turned them down.
 Recently, they started asking me to tackle specific IT tasks as one-offs and I’m finding myself drifting back towards a role I said no to. Being asked to take on more and more responsibilities related to IT. 
 I’m not sure what my question really is. I’m just lamenting the situation, I think. With some institutional support for decision making and maybe some staff to actually execute, maybe I could do the job. I don’t have the experience specifically in IT, though, and I’m muddling through based on having 2 decades of general software experience and enough systems experience to be dangerous.
 There is definitely more to this job, however, these days. More than just knowing how these systems work. There’s prioritizing the various risks the company faces and executing the implementation of systems and processes that we’re now behind on from years of neglect. To say nothing of how to deal with upgrading equipment, budgeting for long term maintenance, etc. It just feels very overwhelming and I’m wondering if it’s crazy that I just want to walk away.

 Of course, the issues with and fragility of Southwest's IT infrastructure have been well-known for years now, and it's management's own fault for not taking the initiative to develop it to meet the demands of their rapid operational expansion and the modern industry (including interlining, GDS interoperability, etc.)...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MDF flooded today (12/26). Well more than just the MDF, like most of the building flooded today when the fire suppression system and water main exploded in multiple places. We're talking 110PSI of water flying out from an 8 inch water main somewhere in the ceiling and just destroying everything. I had a co-worker show me video of a poor HP prodesk getting blasted with unbelievably high pressure water.
 This actually started on xmas (yesterday), I was watching over the cams remotely and seeing the mess unfold. At the time it didn't affect me so I just sat at home and watched the chaos unfold. I thought they turned the water off for the whole building but today around noon - more water lines exploded in a few more places - and one of those was the MDF.
 By the time I got in there, it was no longer raining from the ceiling. 
 It was bad - water was pouring out of the 5x Aruba switches that sent network to the rest of the building, about 7/8 of the network was offline. Luckily the server room and about two IDFs not in the chain were fine. Basically, only the basement of the building near the server room, and one random hallway was unaffected.
 After 3 hrs of using a leaf blower to help the internals of the switches dry, I decided to go for broke and connected them back and they all worked! That part of the network was only down for about 4 hours, so in all honesty I think it worked out pretty well, most people were out of the office so it wasn't that much of an interruption.
 It will hold for tonight but I think I'm going to get my 10g network upgrade very soon. Eventually corrosion will kill those switches.

 I'm trying to set up an Apache as a temporary forward proxy. Actually all it has to do is forward everything to the actual proxy server until some client misconfiguration has been sorted out.
 My config works for http connections but all https connections fail.
 here is the virtual host config:
 <VirtualHost *:8001> ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost DocumentRoot /var/www/html ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined ProxyRequests On ProxyVia On SSLProxyEngine On ProxyRemote "*" "http://xx.xx.xx.xx:9091" </VirtualHost> 
 The error in the log says
 AH01144: No protocol handler was valid for the URL...
 Anyone here can help me out how to get it to work with https? The SSL doesn't need to be terminated on the Apache. Everything should just be shoved to the actual proxy.

 I left the industry just over a year ago, in order to fully commit to my business, and I'm absolutely certain it saved my life.
 Back in 2011 I started working at a small (10 - 40 people) company that managed insurance claims for private companies and public bodies like water boards, regional councils etc - a few years before I left we even managed to secure work with the government, including some government ministries. My main role throughout that time was IT Manager, but as with all small firms, I had to wear several hats - everything from sysadmin through to contract negotiations, and fixing laptop screens.
 Reflecting on my experiences now I think it's a wonder I didn't end up in hospital, or take my own life…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been a Windows sysadmin for over 20 years and while I do still enjoy my job, Microsoft is making it harder and harder every month.
 They will either break stuff with updates or the fixes are questionable and you feel like you have to put them off for a month or two just so it doesn't cause any unneeded stress and extra work. If it's not Microsoft killing something then it's a user needing something after hours or on a day off. (I'm the only IT guy for the company which I know will start other conversations but that's not the point of this post)
 I've been getting into Linux here lately and was wondering if a Linux sysadmin position would be any different.
 I guess a lot of it will depend on the company and support structure so it could be possible to jump to a different company/position with the exact same issues that aggravate me now.
 Maybe I'm just getting burned out and looking for something different (less stress and responsibility) but that would require starting over and probably taking a pretty big pay cut.

 Ideally a Windows based solution. We thought of spinning up a new Exchange server, but that seems like massive overkill. We’d like to also keep the traffic on prem.

 Year 6- Company is delisted and the SW is sold multiple times to equally horrible companies who try to sunset the product and get you to move to their other more profitable products.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I received an offer for a network support position ( network administrator ) in a managed private cloud service provider ( VMWare, Azure as vendor ). Currently working at a TAC for a known network vendor supporting their firewall.
 I'm worried that this role being mostly support ( few change requests, policies, VPN tunnels, VLANs etc. ) could be less benefiting from a career perspective than a more generic network engineer role in an enterprise enviorement ( as it would include maintenance, support, planning , deployment etc.
  
Please share your opinion in the above worries.
 Can you switch into an enterprise role easily after a support role from an MSP?
 How do companies offering contract role view MSP experience?
  
They highlighted that the role is challenging at least 20 times during two interviews and that after 6-12 months project work ( FW deployments, migratons etc. ) can be requested as well.
 Tech stack: - Firewalls: Fortinet, Clavister - Cisco ASR Routers - Switches: Arista, Cumulus - VMWare NSX - NO Automation, NO SD-WAN 
 Tickets are highly variated, examples but not limited to: - Change requests - L2/L3 redundancy - IPSec, SSL VPN, interconnects - Generic R/S TS

 I am in the middle of standing up vRealize for some of these tasks, but I wanted to know what every else is using or would suggest? We’re new to the automation game, and I know my way around PowerShell just fine. But I assume that there is a whole world out there to learn, so I wanted to see what else every recommends for managing windows/Linux tasks, server creation, data archiving, etc…. Thanks in advance!

 If so, what are you looking at?
 We've just renewed support for our vSphere licensing for 3 years to give the business some runway to figure out if we are going to stick around or not. 
 That gives us time to see how much of a damn dumpster fire this Broadcom deal is going to be, but I figured I would see what others are doing.
 Hyper-V is high on my list as we are a Microsoft shop primarily, but XCP-NG looks favorable too. Red Hat Virtualization seems promising as I have played with oVirt but is daunting to deploy. 
 Anyway, thanks in advance for the feedback!

 I had to tell them the classic Linux WiFi example from back in the days of forums where you just didn't ask the question or you would end up with dozens of smart-ass comments and no answers or everyone letting you know you are a dumbass ass for not knowing a simple config. You had to pose it as a challenge or insult. They understood.
 The classic Linux WiFi example - When you have a problem you need help with, how you deliver the question makes all the difference in getting a fix. For example if your wifi stopped working on Ubuntu never go on the forum with a question asking for help to get your wifi working. No matter how detailed you are all you will get is snarky comments, RTFM, you are a dumbass, any noob should know that, and no answer. 
 No, if you want a solution quickly simply post "Ubuntu 10.04 Linux is a hacked together piece shit that won't even support wifi on my Lenovo T43. I'm going back to Windows." Now check your post in about an hour and you'll have a hundred comments calling you a dumbass but also another hundred comments with a step-by-step solution just to prove you wrong that wifi does indeed work on Ubuntu. That my friends is how to get answers on the Internet.

Before, on my Windows 2012 VPS, I was using Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer to scan it for vulnerabilities that hackers could use to hack into my VPS. Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer was quite good and if my memory is correct, it would also check your ports, check if certain protocols were enabled that hackers could abuse (ie. checked if SMBv1 was enabled), etc, which was really useful.
 Unfortunately, Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) has been discontinued by Microsoft and I don't think the last version is even applicable to Windows Server 2019/2022. Is there another very popular software that administrators use to scan a Windows Server for vulnerabilities and if so, how much does it cost (MBSA was free)?

Tried updating firmware/installing uniflow online express, making a user dedicated to accessing the shared folder, everything.

 Their website has some pretty good info on it around their security model and how secure they are but of course "they would say that wouldn't they" seems to apply.
 I have a few people who've been using LastPass now asking me what I'd recommend and usually I say to look at Bitwarden or 1Password but this looks quite good.
 Is anyone using them please and if so what's your feedback on the product both for enterprise and individual use?

For a couple very small sites I know, it estimated <200 visitors in a month, and the rank was like somewhere in the millions. For a much larger site, like cbs.com, it reported/estimated it at top 100 or so, and I think I entered 'facebook.com' and it said #2 at 600MM visitors. I understand these estimates are directional at best, but I thought it was a neat addition to a typical whois search, which doesn't really reveal much these days with GDPR in effect.
 I was using Private Mode on Firefox, so it didn't log in my history, and I can't remember the site now and it's driving me nuts. Anyone have a lead? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys! First time posting on this subreddit, so please forgive me for any mistakes. 
 I am starting a company where I will give my partners/users, an android device, which has a few apps they still use to access my service. The concept is kind of like doordash, but perhaps a bit more individual. 
 For this system I have been looking into a few things, among other things the Soto MobiControl system. To give a better insight of what’s needed and why I will provide a short description below.
  
A way to remotely access the devices so that my team can do the debugging in case something goes wrong, instead of having to try and explain to the users what to do. 
 With this I am also looking to heavily restrict what apps can be accessed, and also settings so the device can only be used for its actual purpose, and the chance for problems by pressing something wrong occurring decreases.
 An easy way to automatically set up the devices with the right apps and restrictions, perhaps using a connection to a pc or something along those lines.
  
I have looked a bit into the Soti platform, but as far as I have understood I need a dedicated server with databases and stuff to use their solution, which is per today not an option. 
 The perfect scenario would be a cloud based system for accessing the above mentioned functions, preferably a cheap one too since we are a completely new company with not much money to spend. I am looking forward to you guys’ ideas!

 There's multiple windows laptops (MACs aren't experiencing this issue) that run into an issue in which when they disconnect from the F5 VPN or when the VPN session times out their WiFi connection will drop and AnyConnect will either sit there and say associating to their home WiFi network or say "No Adaptors Available". The issue will persist until either the AnyConnect client/service is ended or the laptop is rebooted.
 Cisco TAC insists it's not AnyConnect. Microsoft doesn't feel like touching it since it's 3rd party software. 
 Our client team has tried every WiFi driver they could get their hands on. They've tried Windows 10 and Windows 11. They've tried a fresh image. All resulted in the same symptoms.
 Has anyone seen these kind of issues before? Any solutions or suggestions?

 Was told by the replacement IT person that they got hit with ransomware, incl backups. 
 So I said - the documentation is written in a binder in the office with everything you need and why are the backups encrypted?
 Find out that the IT person copied the documentation to the server and threw out the book. They also got rid of immutable backups because it costed to much money. 
 They offered me my old pay (per hour) to help. 
 I wished them a happy holidays and good luck
 Felt so good. 
 Happy Holidays ya’ll!!!

 I have used, and will continue to use, the example of cracking the verifier, as that has a nice analogy to cracking password hashes on a traditional service like Barkbook. But what is at stake here is whether Mr. Talk, given access to what is stored on our servers, would have the capacity to decrypt Molly’s data. Molly’s 1Password Secret Key means that the answer is no. Mr. Talk would not be able to crack that even if he put every computer on Earth to work on the cracking and ran them for zillions of times the age of the universe. I am happy to use words like “never” and “impossible” for that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team is looking at using RedSeal's on prem tool to map our network out. Supposedly you can ingest firewall rules from your devices into the program and it plots out your network for you, showing you what could potentially be exposed to the internet and on what ports so you can review and shutdown any open holes you're not fully aware about or got lost in bad documentation/poor communication issues.
 It's pretty pricy though, the 1st demo I had looked decent but the inventory side of it i've already accomplished via Netbox. I could do the network topology too via Netbox but that's manually entering things in instead of allowing a tool to go out, grab the firewall rules and ingest it properly. I'm sure there's a ansible script method I could use to poll all that info and feed it up into Netbox's api but that's more work then I have the time for currently.
 Was curious if there were any other open source alternatives to this tool or people's thoughts and opinions on it?
 Mostly a RHEL/Ubuntu shop with some Windows hosts peppered throughout.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a 31-year-old junior system administrator. 
 Long time lurker here and nonnative English speaker.
 ​
 Prior to my current role I have worked as helpdesk and field support specialist.
 I love computers and am always motivated to play around on my homelab.
 At home I have an ESXi and Hyper-V host with, Windows server with domain stuff, Linux VM’s, OPNsense, Docker, unRAID, VEEAM. I have 11 entry level IT certifications, MCSA, Exchange, LPIC, ITIL, Comptia, CCNA the basic stuff.
 At the moment I work in an office as internal IT in a team with 3 other junior admins. We are the escalation point of the helpdesk which does suck because we still have to do helpdesk work. The helpdesk techs are on the lowest level I have seen in my career, tech and communication wise.
 My coworkers like to waste half of the day talking about Marvel with the helpdesk technicians and all other types of nonsense. (This will not improve with current management and will probably take years to turn around)
 I currently work on IT projects with other teams and my senior colleague which is interesting. But I do not get any useful input from the other junior admins, they prefer slacking off and goofing around. So, I am kind of a one-man army I have only my senior colleague as a sparring partner and he has a full schedule.
 I find it hard to stay motivated, I am the most technically knowledgeable person in IT besides the senior admin and architect. My colleagues do not show any interest in improving and I have to spoon-feed the helpdesk. So it feels like I do all the giving.
 Does anyone have any tips to deal with this?

 I really love the clean single list style of PaloAlto/Juniper firewalls where a rule is a rule, from and to and it works, vs building rules on a per interface basis to build things up.
 What other platforms are Zone / Flow based and in the small business price range? Any open source options?

 We have had issues with techs changing port configs for key systems or taking things out of agg groups because they don't understand what they are used for. Even after these mistakes I would push towards POLP and they would shoot it all down.
 Well today I'm having to rebuild an ESXi cluster due to another issue caused by untrained people having access to key systems. I'm sure when I go to the lead meeting on Wednesday they will still shoot down my suggestions.
 Who else has to deal with this nonsense? I'm all for people leveling up but a production environment is not the place for this.

 I configured openvpn on Fedora. I know that it's working because when I run a traceroute command, I see the traffic taking another route when I'm connected.
 However, when I try "what is my IP address" in the browser, I see the same IP address, so I'm puzzled.
 Shouldn't the IP address be different too ?
 Thank you !

Inside the box will be an 8 port network switch. Switch will be connected via fiber down the pole and into buried conduit back to the main building.
 The NEMA boxes will be in direct sunlight. It's Florida. It's humid. And also, tt's going to be really effing hot in those boxes.
 I've found a few switches rated up to 60C but I don't think that's high enough, based on our testing. Last summer, we put one of the NEMA boxes in direct sun and put a simple mechanical thermometer inside and it did in fact reach 65C/150F. 
 So... anybody got any ideas that can do PoE (only maybe 50W total) and survive these kinds of environments? Or some other way of doing this?

 I’m thinking of postpone the script and has a medium or something to approve the script after the error has been corrected. 
 PowerAutomate seems promising with the cloud flow + desktop flow integration (premium license). Something along the line of sending email to a monitoring mailbox, extract the body, condition check the extracted body, and call desktop flow to trigger another PowerShell script. 
 Discussed internally and one guy bring up using teams to triggers power automate process. How does this works, does it work with a 1-1 chat or has to be teams channel chat. I looked up google but nothing really pin point my answer. A lot of posts hinted to a teams channel. 
 Anyone has any working automated approval process for scripting or anything similar?

 I solve all kinds of problems and face all kinds of situations without anyone's help.
 I see my other co-workers and they are usually wasting time on social media watching videos, memes or things like that.
 Yesterday we had a brief meeting with the head of the IT department and he said that his goal is that we all get the same payment, even knowing that their level of education is different (I have undergraduate, graduate and I'm studying to get a CCNA certificate) and the others didn't even went to college.
 Honestly, I can't understand why. It seems like all the effort I put in doesn't bring any return and I'm tired of it because when things get tough I'm always "need to be" there to help.

 I am able to connect to the tftp server on udp/69 but the data transfer to copy the data on an alternate udp port seems be blocked. I have permitted all udp ports on the security group for the instance, but not luck. Does anyone know of any other location in AWS / VPC that may block udp traffic of a tftp server?
 I was able to verify that the tftp server does work. I am able to transfer data via tftp within a VPC subnet. It does not work when the traffic is coming from outside the VPC 
 Also I tested two different tftp servers, tftp64 on windows, and in.tftpd on Linux,.and the same behavior occurs on each system. 
 To reiterate. Connections on port udp/69 work. The file name comes through to the server and the server creates the file name to be written to. But the data stream that transfers the actual file data on an alternate udp port seems to be blocked and no data is written to the file. 
 I am stuck, but would like to learn more about AWS plumbing. And felt this might be a pertinent issue to other folks on this sub.

I have several users on the strict policy, but I don't like that it's immutable, i.e., no granular control. And it seems to stop processing rules below its priority, so incompatible settings never get applied. For instance, it won't allow the first contact warning tags, and it isn't campatible with spam notifications and letting the users release their own. I don't need all that work. So my question is: Is there anything the presets do that can't be done by building my own policies? Can I still get the same level of impersonation protection, etc.? Thx!

 Software rollouts aren’t usually fun, especially when they’re hastily patching a production bug.
 A few lifetimes ago, my team had to move the company’s internal software to a larger server overnight without the assistance of the development team. And for bonus points, the dev team lead had a habit of not showing up during big releases and turning off his phone.
 The plan was simple:
 - Migrate to a bigger server
 - Send users to the bigger server

 Users were notified of the details via email, and signs were posted on the doors as they entered the office. Restart your computer, and the automated scripts will update the links to point to the new server.

 ​
 ​
 I will design DFS-N environment for my company. But I have some your valueable ideas.
 ​
 1 - (Option 1 )DFS-N multi namespaces for each department or (Option 2) DFS-N single namespace for all department. What's best practices for this ?
 ​
 I want to config very manageable structure.
 ​
 ​
 Option 1 :

 ​
 Option 2 :

 ​
 ​

 ​
 ​
 ​
 2- What's best practices for those permissions for DFS-N environment? I will setup something like that. 
 ​
 ​
 e.g
 ​
 ​
 DFS NameSpace Name : DATA
 ​
 ​
 Permissions : (Everyone removed, & Authenticated Users = Read) under Customize and FULL Control for Administrators
  \-- IT (Folder) --> Folder Target : NS\_IT 
 NS_IT : Sharing Perm : IT_SG : Modify and FULL Control for Administrators
 NTFS Perm : IT_SG : Modify and FULL Control for Administrators
 ​
 ​
 ​
 3 - I will use Item-level Targeting for drive mapping. I will use Security Groups. Also I want to do the drive mapping for each department.
 ​
 So , G for IT DePartment ,H for HR Deparment and so on. 
 ​
 Lets say , any user moved from the IT department to the HR department. How can I manage the GPO here?
 ​
 ​
 Now I have tested it. I have created a GPO like below.
 ​
 But , although the user moves to the HR department, IT sharing mapping still remains.
 ​
 GPO:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 We are planning to migrate Azure AD Connect from version 1.6.x to the latest version on a new server, via the staging mode method. I already did this in the past, and the process is quite straightforward.
 But in this context, this is a bit different. In the initial configuration of Azure AD Connect, ADFS was configured as the sign-in method. So, during the the AAD Connect wizard on the new server, we have to choose « Federation with ADFS » at the « Sign-in » step, and then, selecting the existing ADFS farm.
 My main concern is about the next step "Azure AD domain": (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/media/how-to-connect-install-custom/adfs6.png)
 We have several federated domains, and here we can choose only one. What will be the impact for all the other ones ? And also for the one that I will select ? All these domains are already correctly federated, I don't really understand what will happen at this step. Do we have to expect user impact ?
 Thanks for your help. Kevin

 I have been doing some googling and some old recommendations seems to be Squid with DansGuardian ( we prefer Linux based platforms ) but i notice DansGuardian is no longer a thing. E2Guardian seemed to take over but that also no longer seems to be active.
 Can anyone recommend a current open source platform we can use that can be cloud based on our own server.

 - While interning at a company the devs were in bed and suddenly the service went down, no-one had the willingness to get up and SSH into the server and fix it. Fix was a restart. Overenergetic intern was willing but not granted SSH access since even with minimal permissions it's a security risk and interns cannot be trusted with production server.
 - While interning as a backend dev, push to staging branch auto deployed the changes, but since maintaining SSH credentials for every employee/intern is tedious, I had to Slack call the server person and get a screenshot of logs which was a pain
 ​
 MobXcess is a tool suite that can run commands 🛠️ on your server☁️ from your mobile📱 device securely
 PS: No SSH Needed 🤫🙅‍♂️
 MobXcess is developed in two parts:
  
Server-Side system developed using Golang
 Client-Side system developed using Flutter
  
The communication is secured using AES-256-GCM cryptography.
 Since it's a REST API, adding SSL will elevate security to a new level.

 merry xmas!
 Does anyone know if there is a source with all the IP Ranges used by Microsoft Autenticator? We would like to use the Location part of the new number-matching feature of Microsoft Authenticator.
 However, since we are using a web proxy it keeps showing a location very far away from where the user actually sits (depending on web proxy location - ZScaler in our environment). The idea would be to exclude the IPs from ZScaler in order to get real and authentic location information.
 How did you solve the issue?
 The obvious alternative would be to deactivate the location matching in the Authenticator but we actually like the feature.

And naturally, like many an organization, we also had an on-call agent for weekends and holidays.
 So it is Christmas morning, I wake up to a phone call from our on-call agent who also happens to be the senior architect/engineer/sysadmin/flavor of the day. "Are you still in town?" Without thinking, I stupidly answered "yes". That was how I got to spend Christmas day traveling hours to a rural radio tower and replacing a dead firewall.
 Turns out, everyone else was smarter than me, the architect included, and were all "out of town".

I'm making my best effort to pay attention and take notes (if for no other reason than to force myself to focus), but I often find myself tuning out anyway. And I won't know until several minutes into a topic discussion that my boss is going to conclude the discussion by assigning the matter to me, whether or not my attention span had failed me 45 minutes into the meeting.
 Which brings me to my point: I need technology assistance here. What software solutions can the community recommend to live transcribe these meetings using the microphone on an Intel Macbook Pro? Unfortunately, it looks like the built-in Mac live caption software only works on Apple silicon. I'm willing to pay money if that's what it takes, but hoping to avoid shelling out for full-blown Dragon.

No way to integrate ADDS into Azure ATP, Cannot do custom delegation, one way sync from Azure and if I want to move groups to different OU's, I'm having to create them in ADDS, but can't reverse sync them to Azure, machines also don't hybrid join, so having a hard time with intune GPOs, the list could go on...
 Recommendations? I think having devices join to AAD is great with Intune, but I don't think being cloud-only for identities, and not having an on-prem instance is ideal.
 Ideally, I'm thinking we leave the environment in it's current state, but move identities on-prem, including groups, and sync everything via AD Connect, while leaving machines joined to AAD, so on-prem won't really need to be open all over with VPN tunnels flying around, just for the purpose of syncing objects, servers, VM's, etc and far better management. Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, seeking advice or experience on moving from HPE Nimble to Dell EMC Unity.
 We currently have 3 ESXi 6.7 hosts connected to a 140TB HPE Nimble CS-1000 on 10gbps iScsi. This Nimble only has 4TB of deduplication capacity. The Unity 380 we were quoted is 384TB with the first shelf (about 74TB) being all SSD, the remaining capacity is 7200 rpm HDDs. 
 Looking for advice and opinions on HPE vs. EMC in this configuration. Most of our storage usage comes from Windows 2016/19 file server VMs.
 How would you compare HPE Nimble to EMC Unity especially in regard to deduplication?
 All of our ESXi hosts are Dell R750s (upgrading from R730s)
 Thank you for any help or advice.

It spins and spins like it is testing, but the fields are blank and no results ever show up. The wire map test still functions fine. So has my $180 cable tester has just became a basic wire map tester going forward? 
 Anybody experience this TDR testing issue with theirs? 
 The iOS app crashes more and more often as the phone gets updated, but I have learned to live with it so far.

New job is over a 60% salary increase, better PTO, and explicitly remote. The current place made a counter offer to match and offered a 75k retention bonus paid out after 1 and 2 years in a 25/75% split. 
 The day before I had my interview scheduled, it was announced that the company was acquired. While larger, the acquiring company's IT infrastructure is lagging behind and was hoping to leverage my company's expertise to help modernize their systems and processes. That expertise heavily is me.
 Fuck em. I make less now than when I was hired due to inflation, and it's like that across all departments. If you're not at the exec level, they don't care about CoL. I might get my piece but my team is still going to get their shit raises. And I'm just... jaded. I don't think I could be happy with anything they offer.
 I'm spending all my time left brain dumping and documenting, I'm not going to make stuff hard for my team. I wish I could take them with me, and I've warned my managers that a couple of them are definitely underpaid and may lose them. 
 Best Christmas in a long time.

 I think there is a need for every engineer to do some basic scripting as it can save a significant amount of time. I can appreciate the skill, but I just haven't been able to bring myself to enjoy it.
 Working with python and go have just felt awful for me, especially the xml, json and expect stuff.
 Shell scripting feels a bit more natural since I don't spend time reinventing the wheel on a ton of functions and I can just pipe to other programs. It's like a black box. I throw in some input and out comes what I need. It's not without it's issues either.

 Ideally, I want a simple sensor we can just data cable (not WiFi) to a switch, with a basic cloud based server. It would alert us (via text, email, or app notification) when the temperature goes outside of a specified range or when it loses connectivity or fails to report within a certain time period. And last, keep a record of temperature reported so, when it loses connection, we can see what the trend was. 
 It seems to me this is a decently big ask on a small budget, but I thought I'd reach out and see if anyone has an experience or recommendations in this field. So far Google has brought up a bunch of options without much context of what is a good option and what is not.

Ruckus with Virtual Smart Zone for the AP's/controller. This is true for all (8) locations. Our uplink to the SonicWall is through VLAN 60, which is also our corporate Wi-Fi. All AP's are untagged for VLAN 60, as is the SonicWall uplink.

 We're a medium sized MSP (250 employees) and we're currently using LastPass and in the light of what happened we're really unsure of what service to continue with, and currently leaning towards not continuing with LastPass. But before we decide fully we want to do some evaluating on LastPass. Our Yearly subscription renews at the start of February and so we decided we want to switch to a monthly payment play in order to not commit to a full year.
 So on hold for their billing support for 1H because you cant cancel auto subscription on your own, you have to call them.
 Then they proceed to tell me that they dont have a monthly subscription, only monthly billing. Meaning I will still be committed for a year even if I pay monthly.
 So I essentially tell them that in that case I will have to cancel because I don't want to commit for a year
 They respond with saying "Go ahead cancel then because we only do yearly subscriptions".
 Honestly, hope they go under.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote a small GUI-based tool that uses the Windows Imaging Format (WIM) to create full backups of computer systems (operating system images) and then restore them.
 The application is hosted on GitHub, is open source, and is offered under the Apache 2.0 license.
 In addition, the repository includes an illustrated step-by-step guide to help get it up and running.
 Maybe someone can use the solution for their purposes as well - I would be happy. Have fun with it.
 Brief summary:
  
WIM backup always requires an external bootable media such as a USB flash drive.
 From this drive WinPE is booted to perform a backup or restore to or from an external medium (e.g. a USB hard drive).
 On the bootable USB flash drive the WinPE must be set up before (is documented illustrated in the readme).
 After completion of the respective operation, a status message is displayed whether the operation was successful or failed.
 After restoring a backup, you can boot normally from the destination drive.
 Both the backup and restore process are relatively simple (not "rocket science").
 To set up the solution, you need about 30 minutes time in the best case due to the necessary downloads (e .g. ADK)

 The MS355-24 has 4x QSFP ports capable of 40 Gbps.
 What are my options for interconnecting these two devices? They'll be on top of each other in a cabinet so DAC is an option. 
 Any help with this setup is greatly appreciated! Thank you.

 The computer name and license key used are listed and we don't recognize the computer as it isn't named the way we name our PCs.
 I email Autodesk support and get this response:
 "I understand that you have gotten a verification/registration email for a computer that your organization does not recognize, my name is Dionne, and I am happy to help. However, I apologize, but we can't see where the installations of products are made from. My apologies.

 So basically, they have no way to track where their software is installed . So they should not be relied on when they want you to pay for more licenses for more seats since they cant prove anything.
 Absolutely asinine.

Which they obviously didn't when they realized that's impossible. (I do their daily physical maintenance and support as well, basically 3 jobs in 1)

 Role 1: 90k but as a lead on a project.
 Role 2: 75k but with a support network around, and potentially a progression plan.

 I'm quite conflicted as to what to do. I'm confident in my own abilities and like the sound of more money, but would feel like I'd benefit from a support network around me. 
 What would you guys do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for advice on Mitel VOIP appliances. Recently joined the business and there is a Mitel VOIP appliance in play for the usual VOIP business requirements. Took a look at the setup and at first glance there is some good practice: the VOIP is hosted on linux servers sitting in their own VLAN segmented from the rest of the network. The only public facing server is the Mitel's conference bridge suite. 
 But there is something i dont understand cause i lack experience with this VOIP software - 1) the controller is being hosted on a Windows OS, iirc its supposed to be on Linux boxes, 2) the devices are domain joined - so i assume the creds of our admins when they are logging in and out of the Windows OS VOIP controller, will be leaving their creds behind in memory no? Or even a LSASS dump could result in compromise of any domain admins that have administered the Mitel suite in the separate VLAN? Am I panicking over nothing here?
 Seems kind of obvious to me that eventually someone will pop the internet-facing conference bridge, move to the Windows OS controller server in the same VLAN, and then dump creds until they find one that can break them out of the VOIP VLAN and get into the rest of the network. 
 Any thoughts?
 Should the Mitel VOIP stuff be domain joined? 
 Should any of the VOIP VMs be a Windows OS?
 Is this setup as vulnerable as i feel it is?

 I would like to setup a personal lab for PowerShell practice/testing, which I can't do at work, and for which I can't accommodate the tin (or a VM) at home.
 Is there a facility where I can have a suitably isolated hosted VM as if an "on prem" DC with AD services, which I can then sync with a Tenancy in AAD/365? 
 I could just buy a vanity domain + DNS hosting, a hosted VM with Windows Server Licence, link to a Tenancy, and go from there - but even for just a half-dozen dummy users with an E1 or two thrown in, my test bed is costing a sizeable chunk of salary.
 Conversely, though, I recognise any hosting is going to incur some cost, and that's "fine".
 Any suggestions please?

 yesterday at around 3pm the our Hyper-V server started running hot and the fans were on full blast. Due to the exchange being there etc. I couldn't restart it before 9pm from home.
 Today at 7am I arrived in the server room and it was super hot (temps said 30 degrees) so I remoted in, powered it off and unplugged it.
 I then carried up a mobile a/c and turned it on to 17 degrees, the a/c inside the server room at 18 degrees (both on high) and turned it on again.
 It's now 12am, and the fans still run at 100%, Hyper-V manager doesn't show any significant VM load (around 2% CPU max.).
 What could the issue be? I opened the door so cold air gets in from the floor, and the a/c's are still running. The fans should start powering down once the room cools down, no? 
 How come it still runs at a 100% even though it's significantly cooler there now?

 So, my question is, can I use a random-industrial-grade CompactFlash or the HP one is needed? And second question, can I use a bigger one? the 16GB is 5 times cheaper than the 4GB for example.
 Obviously I'm only looking at industrial grade high level CFs, not the cheap 10$ ones for cameras

 ​
 Looking for genuine opinions whether Microsoft Unified Support is bringing you value for money if you are using it.
 Yes it is quite pricey, but we are going all in in Azure and 365 and have struggled with getting good quality support from partners so are looking for alternatives.
 Most times we get support from MS, the initial engagement is problematic, but once I start having conversations (moaning...) with our MS account managers and they escalate the incidents to the right person, issues get resolved promptly. It appears that having Unified Support may well get you to the 'right person' quickly.

By the way, when we synced manually, it was getting new updates but showing its status "fail". When I changed the sync time yesterday, I saw that new updates have arrived but its status still shows as "fail". How can i solve this problem. I don't want to reinstall wsus server.

 100 user company on 365 business premium, hybrid environment, roughly 10TB of data, hosted on-prem right now.
 What is the easiest lift that can keep file/folder permission in place and allows easy mapping via GPO? I'm working on getting Intune/AutoPilot set up, testing how the enrollment process works in a hybrid environment now. Haven't seen to many examples for hybrid specific in my research, but I digress. 
 Obviously we have a company OneDrive, I believe 1 TB for biz prem, I would think you could increase the capacity for a fee. Issue is permissions are not a one to one from my understanding. SharePoint is also an option but again, kind of a mess for management in my limited experience. And now there is Azure Files, that seems promising but being my first foray into Azure, seems pricey. 
 Ideally I don't want to redo any permissions and need to have a reliable way to map drives for users. Curious to see what others have done. Thanks in advance

 I am in the process of revamping our service desk team to shift their mindset from reactive to tickets coming in the desk to proactive with a focus on ticket reduction through anticipating customer needs, automation to streamline/free You resources and delivering white glove service.
 I am curious to hear any success stories on areas you’ve focused and seen great success in addition to red flags/issues that came up with unintended consequences.
 Some of the areas of focus for 2023 are: - improve work from home experience and technology performance - conduct a monthly “check up” With all employees with at least 3 being video - revamp onboarding experience and shorten day 1 orientation timeframe - while supporting an issue, proactively review drivers/vulnerabilities/windows updates and address those before logging off.
 These are just a few examples of ways that we’re focused on prevention/proactive/mindset shift
 Any feedback on things that have/have not worked for you?
 Greatly appreciate the insight.

I have generated an installer and an xml file from config.office.com. 
 I have downloaded all the relevant files with the /download switch in the batch file
  
Im having some issues when it comes to trying to install
  
My install O365.bat file is located in \\DC\netlogon\Office Deployment Upgrade: https://imgur.com/a/MKfK17F I have the @pushd and @popd in this batch file becuase the file is in a network location. It was the only way I could allow this file to be ran on an end user machine
 When I run this file I get an error message around the files not being able to be downloaded: https://imgur.com/a/Ouw61rt
  
Im also needing to figure out how to push this batch file once and only once so it only uninstalls 2013 and upgrades once. Wether I use PDQ or a one time scheduled task im not sure. 
 I have been at this for days and im yet to figure it out
 If anyone can assist that would be great

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are you ready for this nightmare story?
 I have a Virtual environment (VMWare, Microsoft) and lost everything on the SAN including VMs and backups. Data recovery is in the process but it will take weeks at best and I am not getting any high confidence from the data recovery team. I have an online backup of user data but no viable backup of the actual DC or any other servers that I can restore. I say that, but there is a remote possibility that I can restore my DC from 6 months ago when we upgraded from 2008 to 2022 and swapped roles, etc., however, that is looking like a pipe dream as well (this would be the 2008 server).
 It is a Hybrid Office 365 environment with on-prem DCs and Azure AD (free) for authentication and all. I am assuming that if I were to create everything from scratch (new Forest and DC) there is a high likelihood of all mailboxes getting affected as well because the on-prem SIDs and GUIDs and Object IDs would be different from what they were previously. Waiting for weeks isn't happening but I need at least some domain functions back to survive the carnage.
 I am looking for some bright ideas to get out of this mess!!!!
 My terrible options at the moment are:
  
Create everything from scratch and deal with hybrid issues later
 Hope and try to restore the DC from 6 months ago and minimize the impact to only new users from that point on.
 Can Azure AD be the savior here? - Can the information in the cloud be used to spin up a DC in the cloud? - If that is possible, does this mean I am not fully cloud-based domain environment, or can I then also have an on-prem spun up later?
  
I am sure there are some bright minds out there to help navigate this mess.
 Thank you!!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a year ago, my manager let me know he was going to be moving to another team and my department director would like to promote me to my manager's position. Nice! Over the following months this shifted to, "we have to post the position and you'll need to apply, but you're our candidate of choice." Interviews were earlier this month and I didn't make it past the first round of interviews. My director pulled me aside afterwards to say that I interviewed well, but he had decided to look for someone with more experience. It sucks but business can be that way, I'll just keep my resume updated.
 ​
 Later, it was dropped that the new manager won't be meeting with our team at any point during the interview process. This manager will also report to two directors; during my interview it became clear they had directly opposing ideas of what the new manager should achieve, (director 1 said it would be the new manger's job to take on work from their team and say no to new work from director 2, director 2 said exactly the opposite), and it very much gave me "divorced parents arguing through the kids" vibes.
 ​
 After thinking about this for a bit, I never would entertain an offer like this if it had come from another organization. If I was applying for a manager role and couldn't meet the team at least once and was expected to report to multiple directors with directly opposing expectations, I never would consider the role!
 ​
 While it sucks that I was strung along for so long, I'm grateful that it helped me see that this probably wasn't a position I would be happy with, and that a healthy organization probably wouldn't make these kinds of decisions.

Like if you knew this issue manifested on someone or anyone’s network, you’d expect it to take 3-6 months for the network team to actually resolve the issue, if they’re damn good. You’d expect it to be a forever issue if they’re average.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I have one domain in the forest, and the domain currently has 4 Domain controllers. One DC is obviously holding the FSMO roles. I just noticed that the FSMO role holder is also a GC. Now in the past i've never paid any mind to this, and the domain seems fine... for years even. But Looking at the microsoft instructions for moving FSMO roles, they clearly state: "Do not put the infrastructure Master FSMO role on a GC".
 Why? My domain seems to be running fine. Whats the difference between a DC that is not a Global Catalog, and one that isnt? Can it still be used the same way?
 I only have one DC at this particular site, if i switch off GC, will everything still function correctly?(Auth, Kerberos, etc).
 ​
 My other Domain controllers are also Global catalogs.

 Anyone know a way, or have any ideas where I can start poking?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there's a better subreddit for this let me know, but I'm having a lot of trouble and dealing with very poor documentation and hoping someone else has tried this. 
 I am primarily the video guy at an arts center, but since my venue went to NDI I have also become the defacto sysadmin for our dedicated video network. It's not fancy - we have a Netgear M4250 managed switch driving the network, and then a bunch of CAT6 run through the walls to our endpoints. I'm trying to add wireless for easier troubleshooting and access to the GUIs for my devices. I thought this would be easy (lol). That's the context, now here's the problem:
 I have installed the Ubiquiti Unifi Network application on my Windows 10 laptop, plugged both the laptop and the U6-LR into the switch (PoE+ capable), and am trying to "adopt" it to my Unifi network on the Windows app. That's what the documentation covers. However, the adoption always fails, then asks me to "enter the device credentials that were set on the previously installed location under network device ssh authentication." Except that I didn't set any of that - this thing is brand new out of the box. I press the "forget" button, which says "the device will be restored to facotry settings". That sounds like exactly what I need, but in practice it just starts this loop over again. Same if I hit the hardware reset button. Adoption failed.
 I'm stumped. Does anybody have any idea what I'm doing wrong?

 Our users have recently been receiving undeliverable messages stating they are the sender and recipient. Mainly because of the way the mail flow rule is setup against dmarc failures. 
 Clearly the messages are phishing. I’m wondering the best way we could handle these? I was thinking I just create a mail flow rule to say if anyone inside the organization receives a message with the body text matching what the custom NDR rule outputs to just drop the message. 
 Thoughts?

The fiber tested good between the two switches, but the vendor is saying the fiber is no good, because the switches will not communicate with each other, but will show activity if you connect to GBIC ports together via short patch on the same switch. What am I missing, and yes I did swap the tx and rx on the patch cable just in case it was crossed somewhere.

 There is a situation that has to be resolved:
 In AD there is a file server srv002 with shared folders Folder1, Folder2, etc.
 The server is running out of space. It was decided to add another server srv003 which has sufficient disk space and use DFS to 'distribute' data between the servers.
 The other intention is not to change paths to which users have got used.
 Is that all possible?
 I am testing with one of the shared folders that exists and cannot get the same namespace...

But god it feels so much longer than that. I'm also the only IT person at an organisation with ~250 people.
 A lot of people lack basic IT skills, which is totally fine, that's why we have IT people. Except they get so mad when I ask them to make sure their username/password is correct, or if their cable is in properly or if they're trying to log into the right platform. People don't understand resolving IT issues isn't always instantaneous and sometimes we need to wait for equipment to be delivered. It seems that I'm often expected to resolve everything Right Now and people get frustrated and upset when that doesn't happen. 
 It's a bit overwhelming to be honest, and I'm still trying to wrap my head around everything. I got 3 day of training before the last sysadmin left. I'm not sure how you guys deal with people who are rude/impatient/irritated. I also get frustrated at the bad communication and poor common sense. Anyone got any advice for this?

 I have a cheap dell t310 with hba sas card and 16gb ram with a zfs1 pool on n°4 sas HD 4tb 7200 rpm each without compression.
 I use proxmox on dell perc raid with 4ssd raid5 hardware managed, where I run some VM and container saved inside the SSD lvm raid and the zfs pool is only for my works files storage with samba with a 2gbps network bonding.
 Also I have an unused 4 old 10k sas disk of 250gb each.
 My question is: - the zfs1 pool has 3X read speed gain but no write speed gain.
 Want to have the sense to install one small sas 10k as a log disk for zfs to speed up write operations?
 If yes, I can work only with a LOG disk or if I add a log also I need to add a cache disk?
 Really thank you

 I hope the hive mind has some input on this.
 We have a legacy application that uses SMBv1. We have recently stood up a new site in AD with a new domain controller. Devices in this site are unable to open the SMB share via \\hostname, but are able to connect via \\IP.-.add.ress.
 Wireshark shows me " KRB5KDC_ERR_ETYPE_NOSUPP ", but zero configuration changes between the devices in site A and site B. I've literally moved VM's from one site to another and have it work in A but not B).
 Site A:
  
DC running server 2019
 XP SMBv1 share
 Clients can connect to SMB share
  
Site B:
  
DC running server 2022
 clients cannot connect to SMB share
  
​
 As a test, I've associated the subnets of Site B with site A in AD sites & services. After a reboot, the devices are able to connect to the SMB share.
 So that leads me to believe there's an issue with the DC in site B, but I'm unsure what/where.
 ​
 Any tips would be very welcome!

 I am a junior Sysadmin for a NGO and we are planning to upgrade our network infrastructure.
 We are using D-Link managed switches (layer 3 functionallities for backbone, access layer 2, ..) and I was looking for good, sustainable alternatives. The D-Link swiches are doing their job but they aren´t that good to handle for my favour.
 While looking up some alternatives I´ve noticed that I dont know that much about the differences between switches from different manufactures.
 Since I´m rarely active in this Community I though I just ask you and maybe join the discussion.
 Maybe some of you could list their favourite piece of hardware they love working with and shortly state why? :)
 It would be nice to get some advice for middleclass price options aswell.

 I ensured that the ADFS is working via this (internal) link: https://xxxadfsservernamexxx.local/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.aspx
 I believe this is an issue with the certificate. That is because during trial and error I got different errors related with the certificate. Like: "Error occurred while adding trusted root certificates""com.vmware.vapi.std.errors.Error" "Certificate bearing subject""is not a valid CA certificate""Please retry with a valid certificate chain".
 We have a CA in the domain and newly created Windows 2022 ADFS server. 
 I have followed the steps in this link: https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/78029
 But there is no clear instructions on what certificate to export and import or how to generate one or whatsoever. I am missing this part. Do I need to get a certificate from ADFS server? From the CA server? What format? How to export? What is a chain? Any idea on how to handle this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, I will post this in the IT Careers subreddit as well, but I feel like this sub has helped me incredibly and I greatly respect the opinions of us folk who are in the trenches daily.
 I took a position as a entry level help desk technician at an MSP a few years ago with no experience. I was stagnant in my previous line of work and wanted to try something new (I’m in my mid 30s). In a few years, I’ve learned a LOT, obtained the triad of CompTIA certs, VMware cert, CCNA, and some Azure certs. I assist in managing our VIP clients, and have been promoted 4 times to get near the top of the food chain on the help desk (about 50 of us).
 I love the type of work I do and it just clicks for me, but a huge downside for me is OT. I understand there is OT for every position out there. That’s part and parcel of work. But the daily 1-3 hours (and weekends) of maintenance and troubleshooting the inevitable issues that arise from that work each night is just something I will not continue to do. Give me 40-42 hours a week. Take your money. I want the time off, away from the office. I’m not going to spend 12 hours a day working when I have a wife and 2 kids at home. It’s just too much, I’m burnt out quickly, and I can’t give my family my full, undivided attention they deserve on a daily basis.
 Are there any options out there for me that I can work my way to that is a more traditional “9-5” job in the IT world? When I’m done for the day, I want to leave my work at work. Obviously a sysadmin role at a company is out of the question. Am I more suited for a solutions role or pre sales? Sales? Account management? I’ve only been in the industry for 5 years so I’m fairly new to what options may even be available for me, if any. So I’m at the point where I need to decide if another career move may be needed. 
 Any advice at all would be appreciated!

VSCode uses my SSH Config and it would be great, if there where a terminal or session manager that would as well.
 I don't need tons of features. Saving sessions would be enough. Doesn't even need Credential management, as that's done through ssh config and keys.
 Is there anything for windows that doesn't rely on putty?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! As the title suggests ive been tasked to look for a self-service tool that provides temporary local admin rights. Right now all of our users have local admin rights on their work devices which is a security risk we would like to mitigate.
 Points to consider are:
  
straight forward administration of the tool
 the tool should be easy to understand for the user
 there should be a way to evaluate who / when / how long someone requsted local admin rights
 it should be possible to determine the duration of the requested admin rights
 Company of about 200 - 300 users
 We are using Microsoft 365 E3
  
Questions we asked ourselves are:
  
Why do coworkers actually need local admin rights?
 can the tool / software be automatically be updated with our images without admin rights?
 can devicedrivers still be installed with manufacturer tools like Dell SupportAssist?
  
As it stands right now in my research on the subject i stumbled upon the tool EAM (Emergency Admin Manager) from dynasys, which looks kind of promising.
 I was curious if any of you have a useful suggestion or better solution to my problem at hand (im still fairly inexperienced and just started my first job)
 im grateful for any help, thank you very much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all Got a call this morning from a prospective customer who is in pretty bad shape. 
 Ransomware'd, majority of data lost and no backups. They switched off all on-prem domain controllers soon as one of their techs noticed weird behaviour.
 Their only saving grace are two domain controllers running in Azure, showing no signs of infection and pretty segregated away from their on-premise environment and adequately backed up.
 I've been brought in as a secondary pair of eyes to relieve the pain on the lone tech on the ground.
 I'd be grateful if you could validate our approach below and any suggestions and pointers you could provide to work around any dangers you may see.
 Approach I'm thinking of taking is, once we're 100% the DCs in the cloud are unimpacted
  
Build clean network
 
Perform authoritative restore of the dc in the cloud into a new on-premise virtual machine
 
Install AD and configure roles onto the new VM
 
Restore system state data from the backup to new VM using Windows Backup Utility
 
Boot new VM into DRSM and run ntdsutil command to start Directory Services Utility
 
Use authoritative restore sub-command to mark relevant objects as authoritative
 
Commit, restart
 
Perform deep AD Health Check
 
 In terms of FSMO roles - unfortunately they were all on one of the on-prem domain controllers, now powered down - would this simply be a case of seizing the roles once I've configured the new on-prem DC properly?

 For reasons I won’t go into, I’m in a need to setup a M365 subscription (E3 Enterprise, likely with the security addons on later) pretty quickly for a business which will host ~1000 users. 
 For these subscriptions, I need to contact the Microsoft sales team. I’ve done this but they’ll take a few days to get back to me (which over Christmas will likely take a bit longer)
 https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/enterprise/e3?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab
 Are there any other ways of spinning up this tenant without engaging a human?
 I’ve noticed E3 Business subscriptions can be done directly from the portal. Can I just sign up for this and then upgrade? Or is this going to cause issues later?
 https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/enterprise/office-365-e3?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab
 Any other options appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're a fairly small shop. Staffed mostly by young developers. We like to have fun when we can, in the past this was done by playing URT on slow days or before holidays. In the last two years there's been a lot of turnover and current folks just aren't into it damn kids.
 So after sneakily gathering intel for the last two months I've gathered that they ALL like to play minecraft. Surprise!
 So, tomorrow as a end of the year gift the company will be playing a Ya-dead-ya-dead minecraft game in a server I spent today building. We're confident most employees have already purchased the game but I've gotten an approved PO to purchase a personal copy for any employee who doesn't so they can join in, and it's theirs. Ties to their personal accounts. 
 I spent the day preparing a full java minecraft package, to deploy at 11:59pm tonight to all systems, and have a custom message that will be pushed at 10am directing users play some minecraft and join xyz server. 
 Once they join everyone will start at a specified point with some messages to read regarding the "game". They'll have the entier day to build the most elaborate home + an attempt to reach "the end". Most likely nobody will get there as its hardcore. Also, if you die you're dead. They've all been provided a named box with the same supplies to help them get started, food and a map.
 Its not much but I'm really happy I was able to get this approved and am able to give the company a few hours of fun before the holidays.
 Any ideas on change to the theme of the game for more fun? I thought YDYD would lead to good braging rights theme. We do have some sales, Admin, and HR folks but they're already all GONE for the holiday. It's literally just a bunch of very young devs and myself for tomorrow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two servers with their own 10gb NICs installed and I'm trying to get an iperf test to make sure all looks good. The issue is that I can't make the connection. I'm using openmediavault as my server and in it I've configured the main port of each NIC with it's own IP.
 Server 1 NIC IP = 172.16.61.8 as a bridge, netmask 255.255.255.252
 Server 2 NIC IP = 172.16.61.9 as a bridge, netmask 255.255.255.252
 ​
 On server 1 I'm running this on iperf:
 iperf3 -s -B 172.16.61.9
 ​
 On server 2 as the client:
 iperf3 -c 172.16.61.9 -B 172.16.61.8
 ​
 But when I run this it just hangs for 2 minutes and then says 'iperf3: error - unable to send control message: Bad file descriptor'
 ​
 What am I missing here? I'm calling the IP for the server's 10gb nic and establishing my local server's 10Gb IP as well but just not making a connection

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Guys, I’ve searched everywhere and couldn’t find a working solution. Here’s my quest. 
 I have a device connected to network 1 which uses mDNS for auto discovery. These network attached devices are only accessible by its software application. 
 I need to be able to VPN into network 1 and access the network devices via their software.
 What I’ve done so far; 
 I’ve got a L2TP vpn to work between the two and I see the device via IP. But can’t access the device since the proprietary software doesn’t see it. (mDNS / Bonjour doesn’t transfer over VPN)
 What are my options here ? How can I make it work. Do I need any specific hardware ? 
 Thanks

 Concerning fiber links especially Fiber To The Home GPON designs. It is common to have 20 KM SFPs at each end of a fiber link. If the fiber link is more than 20 KM and all of the transmit and receive light levels are within spec, what kind of issues will this cause? 
 Some fiber links have a 60 KM SFP on one end and a 20 KM SFP on the other end. I'm not sure what issues this will cause either assuming all of the transmit and receive light levels are within spec.
 I appreciate any help.

 If this is not right, how do I turn them back to capwap AP's? The guide says to just issue ap-type capwap but that command isn't available. I also tried factory resetting but it keeps booting to the EWC partition.

OK. It's only been 2% for several years anyway. So not great. My reviews are exceeds to all of you managers. So I'm not just disgruntled. I'm pretty good at what I do. So what else is going to suck? We have to do after-hours support every three weeks for a full week. They are not going to pay us though. We have to volunteer. Now, in IT we've all canceled family vacations and lost money on plane tickets, yada yada.. It's not just happening to me personally, it's my team. My direct manager is great, and so is my IT director. They are very good human beings. I can't stress that enough. Mr. Rogers's territory nice. "Good people" if you're from the American Midwest. You know what that term means.
 I got a Teams call today from HR. I had used the F word in an email to my wife on 19 Dec 2023 at 0759 EST. I have a company phone and I had used a company phone to say the F-word in an email. OK fine. I violated company policy. I will endeavor to be mindful in the future when using my mobile phone, not to say the F-word or any other word that people find offensive. That list gets updated yearly. 
 I said to the HR rep " you called to chew me out about email usage, but a multi-billion dollar company is refusing to pay the IT department overtime when we actually work overtime? Can you see why I might be upset? You are not solving problems, you're just making problems up. You never just say thank you to us". The HR rep said, "Well, I guess you're thanked with a paycheck". 
 For the first time in 16.5 years, I started updating my resume. I can't continue to "volunteer".

 I've been testing it pretty intensively and already have some understanding. However, it would be nice if anybody can share their experience with the company and its products.
 For now, my specific case is a branch VPN router, but I have a few more places where they might fit, just lack external information and have to stick to their corporate website only.

 Example: I have a 200Mbps L2 circuit plugged in to a 1Gb port on an Arista switch. There's a bunch of output discards and I found myself wondering if it best practice (or would even make a difference) to shape the interface down to 200000Kbps. I attempted to do this as a test (rate shape 200000 kbps) and it didn't change the incrementing output discards (but I'm fairly certain I've still read this as best practice before).
 Any guidance on this one appreciated. Thank you!
 [EDIT]: I'm also (now) fairly certain my config was wrong as rate shape doesn't do anything without QoS queues defined, but I'm still curious about the best practice aspect. I believe this is how I'd do it on Arista (?): Rate Limit on Arista switch

 Beginning December 20, 2022, Rapid7 has responded to an increase in the number of Microsoft Exchange server compromises. The attacks appear to chain CVE-2022-41080 and CVE-2022-41082 together to bypass previously recommended URL rewrite mitigations that Microsoft provided for ProxyNotShell. Threat actors are using this to deploy ransomware. 
 Rapid7 recommends that organizations who have yet to install the Exchange update (KB5019758) from November 2022 should do so immediately and investigate systems for indicators of compromise. Do not rely on the rewrite mitigations for protection. 
 Customers already have coverage to assist in assessing exposure to and detecting exploitation of this threat: 
 ​
  
InsightVM and Nexpose: InsightVM and Nexpose added checks for CVE-2022-41080 and CVE-2022-41082 on November 8, 2022.
 InsightIDR: InsightIDR customers can look for the alerting of 8 rules listed in our blog post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this morning I was alerted by some users to a suspicious email. I figured it was yet another phish that made it through filters. But no.
 A worker for a state agency seeking child support from someone who MIGHT work/have worked for us was reaching out. Legitimate email. Now, did they send this to HR? Some high profile person in the company? No. Somehow they managed to figure out three of our internal distribution lists (likely more, but only those three accept email from outside the domain) and sent a blast out to all of them.
 This is already in "Oh hell no" territory. But it was worse. There was an attachment as well as the person's name. And the attachment, an OFFICIAL DOCUMENT, had the Name, Address, Family Members, and SSN of said person they were looking for. Sent to a distribution list with hundreds of recipients.
 HR notified, and well... I'd been putting off on learning how to mass delete things via Exchange powershell. Email is gone except for what's been saved as evidence, but that information was still accessible for several hours. To hundreds of people.
 In HR's hands now, and I really hope that state worker gets more than a slap on the wrist.
 Bless all of you who put tutorials online.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I have something like this across 2 data centres (green is Site A, yellow is Site B): https://i.imgur.com/nKKrVnN.png . The 2x2 ToR switches are OS10, and I'm new to them. 
 Each site has its own edge so internet bound traffic is always directed from the 2 switches to their respective local firewall as their default g/w. 
 Is it then possible to configure the ToR switches to monitor an internet IP and if it is down, change their default gateway? 
 Take for instance the green side. I want 172.30.0.11 and 172.30.0.12 to monitor an internet ip (say 8.8.8.8), and if its unreachable, change its default gw to 172.30.0.4 ? 
 Thanks for any tips.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We had basically no spam filtering when I inherited my new role managing a company and their email was just a firestorm of spam and garbage.
 I enrolled the domain in a new spam filtering service (Antespam) which I've used many times in the past and love it and it offers users the ability to whitelist/manage their own spam and have great customer support.
 Not 3 days in and I'm already getting all kinds of push back from people whining that they don't want to have to babysit their email.
 I've tried telling them that checking the sidelined emails every day or at the beginning and end of each day here initially will give them the chance to add senders to their whitelist and as a result, legitimate emails getting sidelined will occur less frequently.
 "Thanks, I hate it."
 I implemented the filtering on Friday night and it's blocked 9 viruses, one spear phishing attempt and 91% of inbound mail was spam.
 The users heavily impacted by spam in the past are singing praises from the mountaintops (some would get anywhere from 50 to 100 spam mails per day) but those who got relatively no spam are up in arms that they didn't need it, want to opt out (you can't) and are seemingly trying to convince management that we don't need this.
 The CEO is on my side, agrees that it's best for our network safety and approved the move to the service. I am just trying to craft that diplomatic message to the nay sayers who maybe weren't really affected by spam before but now are having legit emails get put on the sideline and causing them to have to routinely go and check for mail sitting in the filter.

 Obviously I've tried running the command by itself and it does work.
 I've tried to get the output of winget - -info to a file and it does not work either.

 ​
 Edit: Just to clarify i have the tx from each of the transceivers tapped, and im trying to input this into the rx of another cwdm4 to see what i am receiving. The problem is that i'm not getting anything from the transceiver even though i have great signal strength.

 Any tips for me?

 so i am new to this field and landed few months ago this "helpdesk" role but i am kinda a jack of all trades.
 I need to take on some security tasks, one of them is to split all the admin accounts to 2 accounts, 1 account to do admin stuff and 1 "normal" user account. (so for example, the IT personel now only uses 1 account for everything like normal desktop and mail work and also admin work). we want to split these into 2.
 I thought the best way to do this is to take a copy of the existing admin accounts and demote the existing admin account to an user account and the copy is the new admin account to do admin stuff. 
 Does any of you guys has experience with this? i am a bit stressed to operate this project. Any help is welcome.
 We are on a hybrid Microsoft environment.

For starters when I try to enable the wedget for the weather it tells me I need to log into my MS account, same goes for when I want to setup the Windows Hello.
 I have normal Windows 11 Pro machines at the office and I never have to log into MS to setup the wedget, as for the Windows Hello I haven't experienced it yet as the owners don't believe in laptops. LOL So this one is our first. 
 So I wonder if I should do a reinstall of Windows 11, but I am not sure how its going to work if I need to retype the KEY once its loaded to get back into Professional, at which point I might be just chasing my tail!? :(

 Let's say my domain is domain.local and my domain controllers are DC-OLD and DC-NEW. I have promoted DC-NEW to be a Domain Controller and Demoted DC-OLD. When I look in my DNS I find:
 1) zone _msdcs.domain.local, this zone contains all records I expect, SRV records / _gc records / _ldap records etc.
 2) zone domain.local, this zone contains all servers / computers / etc.
 3) subzone, _msdcs under number 2. This is a DNS Delegate if I am right (grey icon). In this subzone I only find a NS record pointing to DC-OLD
 The NS record under 3 is not updated by the DC promotion and demotion (number 1 is updated correctly). Feels like it is not actively used in my situation, if I do a lookup to _msdcs.domain.local it will answer with information found in number 1. I think this is some sort of pointer solution used in ealier versions of Windows AD.
 What is the right thing to do? I can think of 2 scenario's:
 a) Replace the NS record of DC-OLD with DC-NEW
 b) Do not give it any attention, let it just like this
 I think scenario a is the best option. Is this correct and does it have any impact on my AD / DNS if I take this action?

 I have configured an M2 based Macbook for a remote user, and part of that is installing the DUO client. Whilst setting it up, everything worked well and Duo sent a push notification to approve the login.
 Now the user has it, the laptop is obviously not configured for their home wifi, so Duo complains that it can't do anything as it has no network connection. Putting the user in bypass mode makes no difference, as the client still can't connect to the Duo servers...
 Apple in their infinite wisdom doesn't allow you to connect to a wifi network from the login screen. Using the Option key to boot up and connect to a wifi network doesn't pass the connection through to the login screen either.
 I have sent the user a USB-C to LAN adapter which said it was plug and play on Macs, and although it works on their personal Dell laptop, it doesn't work on their company issued Mac. I don't know if this is because it doesn't work on M2 devices, or if the Mac needs to silently install something when it's connected, but because the laptop isn't logged in, it's not able to.
 I've ordered another adapter for the user which claims compatibility with M2 Macs, so I'm crossing fingers for that.
 The user is 2 1/2 hours drive away, so a visit is not really practical.
 Does anyone have any ideas on how I can best get this user up and running?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Problem: People are missing non-junk emails because they end up in the junk folder. Especially if they are auto-forwards from another domain.
 Ideally, we want nothing to go into the junk folder (unless on the block senders list). So everything goes to the inbox, notwithstanding malware and phishing. With everything going to Inbox, it would also be nice to get some indicator of junkiness as a MailTip on the message, but we'd settle for pre-pending the subject.
 Have a ticket open with Microsoft, and here's what we tried:
  
Change the anti-spam policy. Any actions that say 'send to junk folder' have been changed to prepend the subject with 'Possible spam'.
  
This doesn't really work. Yes, the subject is changed. But the email still ends up in the Junk folder. Maybe Outlook is doing this by examining the SCL. But there's also no way to turn off the junk filter in Outlook. Just in case, I checked the blocked domains/emails list, and it is empty.
  
Set up a transport rule to change all inbound mail to SCL -1. 
  
This works, but I don't like it because a) it doesn't prepend the subject, and b) it alters the SCL artificially, so by the time you get the message, you don't know what the original SCL was.
  
Adjust the rule to prepend a subject. Ended up pre-pending everything. So we adjusted the rule to only apply to inbound mail where the SCL was above 4. But then the rule seemed never to get applied.
  
Advice? (other than use a 3rd party product)

 Do you guys have a tool, more like a database which is good for note storing? Something where you can reference a ticket number or project name and link all the notes you took relating to it.

 I'm just looking at the Cisco build tool and as usual I'm confused by it. 
 I know you have to order the DNA licensing but don't have to renew it but what I can't see is if you don't renew are you then on a reduced bandwidth? 
 I need the C8500-8S4X to have 10Gb available throughput and looking at the license options it has the below: 
 DNA-P-T3-A-3Y = Cisco DNA Advantage On-Prem Lic 3Y - upto 10G (Aggr, 20G) 
 If I get this and it expires after 3 years will it then reduce the router down to it's base throughput whatever that may be? 
 Or am I looking at this wrong and the C8500 series isn't license locked anyway?

 I know this sounds unbelievable but whenever I try to run a non-powershell command in PowerShell in a GNU screen session, the terminal is getting stuck.
 I am able to reproduce this on my Ubuntu 20.04 server:
  
Open up a screen session by invoking screen
 Run a non-powershell command in PowerShell: pwsh -c "id -u"
  
This error occurs both when starting a screen session on my host, connect to my server via ssh and run pwsh -c "id -u" and when first connecting to my server, starting a screen session on my server and running pwsh -c "id -u".
 My current workaround is to instead run pwsh -c "{ commands }" | cat.
 Running pwsh -c "id -u" in a screen session on my host (i.e. without ever connecting to my server via ssh) works.
 Does this sound familiar to you? I'm very confused - it doesn't make any sense to me.

 ​
 Thinking with only 35-40 clients (servers are managed by Azure Update Automation which is not supported for Windows 10), wouldn't it be easier with updating against WU directly? 
 Bandwidth is not a problem. But we want maybe be able to do half of the workstations at the time if we get an bad update.

 I think MI Support is playing me here.
 We are currently running Core 11.5 and we usually use a policy to restrict iOS devices not up to date to connect to our Infra.
 Our current config is set to quarantine anything before iOS 16.1. With the arrival of 16.2 we wanted to update said config to 16.2 but it is not listed there.
 ​
 Mobile iRon is not telling me to update Core because only EPMM 11.8 will support iOS 16.2.
 They are sending me a bunch of kbase about Compatibility and according to said kBase even Core 11.7 would be not compatible with anything above iOS 15.5.
 ​
 Am i the only one having such problem with Ivanti/Mobile iRon ?

 ( We could upgrade, but given the poor support, i'm not sure this would fix it. 
 We are on freeze due to year end, so that would anyway require a thousand approvals from the business.
 yes i have done the Device and Platform update manually ).

 Never had such non-existent support with any vendor. 
 Do you have recommendations for a viable robust alternative?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Might be a long shot with such a specific monitor/series of monitors but the issues we are experiencing are killing us and Dell are mostly denying there's anything wrong with their hardware.
 We have a few thousand of these in use. On the latest firmware (*08). Power Saving turned off. Dell laptops. Dell keyboards and mice. Dell everything. Some of the issues our user's get:
  
Loud screeching noise from the speakers begins randomly while user's are in Teams meetings. Monitor has to be power cycled to shut it up.
 
Various devices inside the dock will randomly not be passed to Windows (eg: ethernet, 2nd display (daisy chained)). Sometimes both displays show nothing but peripherals like keyboard and mouse work. Unplugging the USB-C cable and plugging in 3 to 20 times seems to resolve it until next time.
 
Slow detection/starting up of monitor/dock once USB-C cable is connected. Users say they "often" see it take a minute for the screens to display anything.
 
Arcing / crackling sound when the monitor is in standby and no laptop is connected. Power cycling stops the noise temporarily.
 
Microphone quality / audio issues during Teams meetings. I'm aware of the "double noise cancellation" issue that occurs when Teams is trying to reduce background noise and the monitor's microphone is trying to do the same, but come on, these are supposedly "Teams certified" devices. How is this conflict expected behaviour?

Boss allocated few licenses for 2016 and we still have issues - certain files won't open and network usage sharply increasing during opening that certain file, although, mail text is empty sometimes, some has crashed when setting up signatures.
 Switched from 2010x86 to 2016x64, clean install. Additionaly installed SAP and Oracle SmartView and updates. We were also trying to open a file without sap and sv, no change.
 That accounting department won't pay us for that switch lol. The funny thing is that this issue is only on new laptops company bought. Both new laptop and old pc has same os, same updates and same software with add-Ins, but laptop won't open docs that pc can.
 Reinstalling windows would be a nice idea tho. Still, this case has 33% chance after reinstalling windows.

 I'm not a DNS expert by any means. In fact I inherited the responsibility. But there's a lot of looks like garbage in there probably from previous me's and you's that said maybe this will work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll try and keep this brief.
 We have a new 1GB DIA circuit from Zayo in the datacenter we're colocating in. The datacenter tech ran a SMF jumper from the Zayo handoff to our cabinet where for the time being I have it going to a 1.25GB SPF module in an EdgeRouter X SFP.
 That's it. Simple and sweet, but I'm only getting aprx 150-180Mb down, 300-400Mb up speeds. That's testing from every major speed test website, as well as running Iperf to the public 10Gb servers. Also tried testing directly from the router itself using Ubiquiti's speed test built in UISP. Same every time.
 I tried both setting the router up as a L3 gateway, and as a L2 switch. Same results.
 Naturally Zayo refuses to even consider the problem may be on their end.
 Any suggestions?

It's about 25 miles away but the traffic is so horrible my average daily commute is 1hr10min each way. That's 40hr+ a month sitting in traffic. During holidays my commute is 25-30 min and any bit of rain makes it 1hr30min+. What's even more sad is traffic doesn't die down until 8-9pm. I HATE SAN ANTONIO. /rantover

I told him they should be paid the same if they had the same experience, etc; he said that sysadmins are worth more. I was flabbergasted. As the senior netadmin, I’m compensated the same as the senior sysadmin. Is this a common thing in IT, across industries that sysadmins are worth more than netadmins, or am I right in demanding they be equal?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At one of our branch sites, for the past few days, users have been complaining about network connectivity being lost or crawling while attempting to access certain websites. During the time they say the issues are happening, no maintenance, or backups are occurring. Something tells me to check the routes on the customer edge router at the site and I see that all of iBGP learned routes are recently learned. Flapping has crossed my mind so I check the logs, and around the same time users “lose”connectivity to the sites, one can see BFD adjacencies going down between the CE spoke and a WAN reflector we have in another location. 
 Interestingly enough, the websites users are attempting to access are not suppose to be learned via iBGP. They are externally redistributed in EIGRP. During the issue, when checking the time of the EIGRP routes, they are days old. So how could users not have access to the sites? When you run a trace to the website during the issue, it makes it there. When you check the ISP vrf, the route to the PE is still there. No circuit issues are seen. 
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I am looking into start of authority and am curious about something.
 We have 5 Domain Controllers, 2 of which are having replication issues. DC1 is one with replication issues and also so happens to be the SOA for all DNS zones on all of the DCs.
 DC2 is a direct mirror of DC1, with the exception of ADFS, and so I thought "what if we made DC2 SOA for all the DNS zones across all DCs"
 If this change were to be made, what potential issues would you expect I run into?
 The reason this thought exists is due to replication being down on 2 DCs, we want to demote and repromote without DNS giving us an error, especially since we already tried this and we found out that it was due to SOA.
 Any insight into this or helpful suggestions, would be appreciated.
 **additional info*\*
 there is a bit of background missing here, most of which I do not have since I have only been in this position for 5 months.
 From what I can put together from various conversations the prior sys admins made undocumented changes to the DCs, which ive been working to understand,. its slow going.
 The issue we have is 4 of the 5 DCs have the same DNS forward/reverse zones and the 5th is minus a few the other 4 have.
 The replication issue came on roughly 2 months ago and only hit DC1 and DC5 with an error that states "sysvol inaccessible"
 We tried to demote DC1 and repromote it, but when we did we got an error stating the DNS server was not present even though the role existed. 
 One of our contractors helped look into this and determined it could possibly be a start of authority issue.
 I have never had to actually do this before in all my time in IT, so this is very much uncharted waters for me.

 Thank you

 I have a question in regard to setting up some filters on Juniper EX switches and I hope you can help me out with a sanity check and ideas on how to make my configuration better. Or if I am on the wrong path - set me towards the correct one.
 For the sake of this question, let's assume the following very simple topology:
 ​
 Juniper MX Edge ----> Juniper QFX Core ---> Juniper EX top-of-rack ---> Host1, Host2, Host3, HostX
 ​
 Each VLAN is up on the QFX Core and the EX TOR switches act as simple Layer2 devices only. Ideally, we want to keep this configuration like that and not bring VLANs up on the EX switches - only ACLs.
 ​
 Currently, each of the hosts connected to the TOR switches (in our case - dedicated server services) are in their own VLAN with a /30 of IPv4…]]></summary>

 I have an HCI cluster connected to two disparate switches. The NICs on the cluster are set to active-backup, so if the active fails for whatever reason it is supposed to switch to the backup.
 The two switches are directly connected via LAG/Trunk (LACP). The two switches are also connected to the core for user traffic.
 I'm trying to avoid potential issues with spanning-tree topology changes causing all of the ports to go into listening mode for 30 seconds, and crashing the whole cluster. I have implemented portfast/admin-edge on all ports connecting to the HCI, but I also want to enable it on the Trunk/LAG.
 I've been taught to never implement portfast on uplinks to other switches, so I'm afraid to pull the trigger on that last part. But I would think that the core uplink from the secondary would always be in a blocking state unless the primary core uplink goes down. Does that sound right? 
 Thanks!

 Recently I was connecting 2 floors together with the exact same Cisco 9300s, running near the same SW Ver (One is running 17.03.04 the other 17.03.05). While connecting these two with SFP+, I put in the EXACT same SFP+ modules, and I couldn't get a connection, even though the switches saw them both. Both SFP+ were brand new. After much troubleshooting, I swapped one out with a different one, and viola, I got connection. Now here are the two SFP+ modules, and tell me how this is working, and why the exact two didn't. (I'm new to working with fiber, so please bear with me) 
 Floor 3: SFP-10G-BX ; 1330nm ; LC Connection
 Floor 2: SFP-10G-BX80 ; 1270nm ; LC Connection 
 I thought the wavelengths HAD to be the same on both ends? What's the deal? Also, this is a single wire, yellow cable, (SFP's are single too) which I believe to be single mode. Any insight would be appreciated!

 I have a few servers with a conglomerate of control panels and want to test something else to see what's out there.
 I stumbled on VestaCP, but that project seems dead, Hestia Control Panel seems to be the fork of that, and has code commits on github as recently as two days ago.
 Anyone here able to give me an unbiased elevator-pitch like opinion on it? I have a server with openisp but postfix on it keeps giving me the odd grey hair, and it is overly complex to maintain IMO.
 Feedback will be massively appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts or experience here before I jump down this rabbit hole.
 I'm in a ~80 user environment that has on-prem AD (probably not going away) that's using ADConnect to sync users to the cloud and O365/Exchange Online (for many years). Exchange has never been installed in this environment, so there are no Exchange attributes in AD.
 I have a few items I'd like to tackle (mostly cleaning up the GAL (hiding on prem DLs, hiding certain users), ability to add additional addresses to users) that seem they would be easier if I had the Exchange Attributes in AD. My understanding is I can just run 
 XX:\Setup.exe /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms /PrepareSchema 
 and that will give me the attributes I need, not install Exchange and I can do basic management from ADSI. I know I'll need to refresh the schema in ADConnect, and I know that for "msExchHideFromAddressLists" to populate, "mailNickname" needs to be populated an unique.
 Here are a few questions I've come up with
  
Will this overwrite anything in the cloud and 'break' existing mailboxes (stuff like legacyExchangeDN or X500 addresses)
 Should I continue with the installation of Exchange server for management purposes? If I go this route, do I need to set up Hybrid Mode? Or is 'just installing' Exchange enough?
 Am I muddling my environment by adding Exchange? Should I instead take alternate routes to accomplish these goals? (like use msDS-CloudExtensionAttribute custom sync rules) For what it's worth, if I installed Exchange, my plan would be to have it on a server that's only booted when doing management tasks, but otherwise not powered on.
  
I'm wondering if anyone else has gone down this path before, and curious what you've seen... most of my worry is in overwriting something that was custom set on the cloud for a sync'd user, though I know most parameters must be sync'd from on-prem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 ​
 I am trying to write a batch file that goes through a text file and for each line of the text file runs psexec net user command.
 ​
 So far I have the following
 ​
 @echo off setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion :: Reset file Type Nul >"C:\outputfile.txt" for /F "delims=" %%a in (C:\ip_addresses) do ( set Var1=\\%%a psexec.exe VAR1 net user COMMANDS_HERE >NUL 2>&1 If !errorlevel! equ 0 ( echo %%a Account-Created echo %%a Account-Created>>"C:\create-account.txt" ) Else ( echo %%a Account-NOT-Created echo %%a Account-NOT-Created>>"C:\create-account.txt" ) ) pause 
 ​
 I am definitely getting the second part of the else statement because I can't figure out a way to add the "\\" to the %%a placeholder so that psexec executes on the target machine.
 ​
 I know the command I am running with psexec works without an issue as I have tested individually.
 ​
 I have to use this process or manually go and touch about 50+ machines ;-)
 ​
 I appreciate any input.
 ​
 Edit:
 Fixed formatting so my code was in code block format.
 ​
 Edit2:
 Powershell remote administration is not an option...I know, I would much rather use the fantastic tools supplied with Powershell.

In Mimecast the email bounces with an NDR 5.4.1 Recipient address rejected. At first I thought it was a problem with Mimecast but it seems this is the bounce you get when DBEB is rejecting the email. Now I didn't know much about it too be honest until the last few weeks. Microsoft support is useless. They just constantly refer me too their support page explaining DBEB. This user is replicated correctly within O365 from what I see, and our accepted domains are all set to authoritative. Besides that, I am convinced this support system sending these emails (amazonses) has the user on the account level suppression list due to the bounces, but I don't have access to this account to verify. Either way DBEB is the first barrier I need to make sure is not rejecting emails to valid addresses. Anyone have any ideas?

 I'm pretty unfamiliar with ACI/Dashboard, but they're pushing this because I wanted to use VDCs, and they're saying I can do the same thing but with 'slices'. 
 Additionally I can see us using VXLANs as well.
 WTF am I getting myself into? Managing Nexus at the cli is no problem for me, but selling my soul to a dashboard (one from Cisco at that) is something I'm wary about.
 Should I bail?

 I'm looking for the smallest footprint network monitoring and alerting software available. I need to install it in *NIX. All I need is icmp/TCP checks on around 20 remote devices, and then email alerts if those aren't responding after a certain amount of time.
 I don't need a web interface, or graphing, or historical data. I'd even prefer to avoid installing mysql or any DB if possible.
 Does anything like this exist? I've used LibreNMS/Zabbix/icinga2/etc in the past and they are fantastic, but they are overkill for the needs I have on my current project.
 Maybe my best option is to throw together a crude bash script?
 Thanks in advance for any ideas you can send my way!

 However, I got mixed information regarding these shared mailboxes also needing an exchange license (I don't need any of the exchange features coming with the license).
 So my question is:
 Do I need an exchange online license and MDO licenses for each shared mailbox? Or is a MDO license enough?
 In case I need an exchange license, what happens if I run it without one?

Problem is it doesn't seem to work with M365. I've gone in one of our domains and changed the MX, then went into the verifiers and added one for M365 and authorized it with Microsoft but it won't test and it won't discover mailboxes. Tech support says to use the M365 verifier and RCPTTO for discovery but it doesn't work. And the error I'm getting on every single page of the website is a generic "an error occurred. If this continues contact the administrator" not anything like "failed to discover mailboxes" or "verification failed". It's like a web page error.
 Support has been no help at all. They keep saying the same thing about using the verifier and RCPTTO and that there's an issue with the testing. When I explain I've done that they ask another dumb question like "are the mailboxes not being created?" And then don't respond again. I've had pretty good luck with them up until now but I'm seeing the Rackspace fiasco all over again.
 Anyone have this working?

 Just checking the logon events in the security event log journal on one of my DC and i'm wondering if this is the expected behaviour that i have this:
 A Kerberos service ticket was requested.
 Account Information:
 Account Name: my domain administrator account (administrator@mydomain.whatever) Account Domain: my domain Logon GUID: xxxxxxx 
 Service Information:
 Service Name: a workstation from the domain$ Service ID: domain\\workstation$ 
 ​
 Network Information:
 Client Address: ::1 Client Port: 0 
 ​
 Additional Information:
 Ticket Options: 0x810000 Ticket Encryption Type: 0x12 Failure Code: 0x0 Transited Services: - 
 This event is generated every time access is requested to a resource such as a computer or a Windows service. The service name indicates the resource to which access was requested.
 This event can be correlated with Windows logon events by comparing the Logon GUID fields in each event. The logon event occurs on the machine that was accessed, which is often a different machine than the domain controller which issued the service ticket.
 Ticket options, encryption types, and failure codes are defined in RFC 4120.
 ​
 ​
 Do you guys think it's normal to see my administrator account requesting kerberos ticket?

This situation has all the hallmarks of business management strong-arming the IT organization into an unrealistic timeline. When business leaders push for overly-aggressive timelines, or regulators ask for multiple competing risk frameworks and excessive after-the-fact incident reporting, this all puts a strain on the delivery organization’s ability to untangle the complexity before ‘go live’.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 After 10 years, in march of next year our root vpn cert will expire. I was tasked with renewing the cert(s).
 We have a large volume of connected devices that sometimes can have a downtime of few weeks, so i need to think and implement a solution fast so it can propagate.
 The devices have various hardware and software configurations, from different time periods, so i want to make as minimal changes as possible (e.g. avoid redirecting to a different openvpn instance).
 My google-fu gave me one method - stacked certificates - also explained by hexonet on their blog: https://www.hexonet.net/blog/migrating-new-ca-for-openvpn , it seems that i could simply regenerate the client certs based on the new ca cert and swap them one by one without killing "old" access for not-yet patched cients.
 How would you approach it? There are milions of users so i would prefer to not introduce any significant downtime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'm writing this post to get some advice regarding a problem that is affecting the network of the company I work for.
 Our infrastructure consists of L2 devices (switches, radios etc) within it and is "delimited" by many L3 routers which are the edges of our unic large broadcast domain. Obviously there are several VLANs within it, but we have to propagate them over the backbone links, preventing us from segmenting the network.
 The problem is the following: every time we put a new PC on the network, it starts a NetBIOS boradcast storm that propagates to all our switches, causing us many problems. We have intercepted the packet with WireShark and we are certain that this is the problem, what we don't understand is why the packet continues to run even after disconnecting the offending PC. We have already taken steps to put in the broacast limits (storm constrain etc) but we would prefer to solve the problem at the source.
 Has anyone ever had a similar problem? Is there any way to prevent the storm, apart from disabling NetBIOS? Could this be due to a malware installed on one of our networked devices?
 Thanks to all those who will respond!

 I have a VBS Script installed on my Thick client pc's to get the information i might need. Now this works completely fine on local windows computers. But when i run it on a thin client or rdp session it (ofcourse) gives me the information of the server.
 Now what i would like to get is the connected server name, Local pc name, logged in user, windows build version of the client pc, and which groups/roles are added to the pc and logged in user.
 My current vbs script is visible here: https://pastebin.com/raw/iqnXY3VF
 I already searched on google but most of the things i could find are for local pc's.
 thanks everyone in advance
 edit: I am aware that this might belong in the techsupport reddit but i think the changes to solve this are higher in the sysadmin community

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have a problematic that I'm not sure how to solve easily :
 Previously, we had some Office 16 licences and we used them on some PCs from our fleet. But they weren't many and we widely used LibreOffice instead. So when we wanted to install Office on a certain PC, we used a .exe and did a manual install.
 Today, we decided to switch to Office 2019 for all of our users, and with that comes a problem.
 I have to create a GPO which checks if Office 2016 is installed on a computer. If so, it should uninstall it and then install Office 2019 with our key.
 But I also have to make sure the PCs with Office 2007 are excluded from that GPO, since we still use that with some applications that require 2007 specifically.
 Do you think I can do that with only one Powershell script for example ?

 We have them in several locations and I've recently taken the role as primary maintainer. What I've found is that they seem to be very buggy. They come with a process that will initiate a reboot when internet connectivity is lost but once in a while, they don't fully recover from the reboot. power cycling to reboot again doesn't work. 
 We also see an issue where the admin interface ssh daemon fails and you can't log in that way. webui still works. 
 Their support is... lacking to say the least.
 Their firmware path is questionable. 
 Multiple power cycling doesn't appear to help, only consoling in and rebooting that way allows it to properly shut down and restart.
 So it almost seems like our out of band management system needs an out of band management system.
 Anyone else have experience with Perle and maybe some hints?

 We're running through Cyber Essentials, and one of the passing criteria is to block models that no longer receive security updates from the manufacturer (eg Pixel 3a with Android 10) from accessing cloud resources (authenticating via Azure AD).
 How are people managing similar scenarios, it seems a bit over kill to force users to enforce users to use Edge and enroll into Intune to manage this.
 My thoughts turn to Conditional Access Policy, where for iPhone I could block by iOS version, but that's only shows a major version, ie iOS 16, not iOS 16.2. Android is even worse where it seems to just display Android
 Have others had to achieve the above and if so how are they tackling this? Is the only way by enrollment? I'm using a Microsoft 365 E5 license if that helps suggest options.

 I have to provide a Virtual Windows 10 Machine for a supplier, from which they can Access certain Servers.
 The Provider has quite high priviledges, which is why i'd like to Monitor the Desktop, to see what he did when. The Provider accesses the machine via Teamviewer.
 What is the best / cheapest option, to monitor a single client / user. It's only a temporary solution, in two months, i dont need the product / license anymore.
 ​
 Thanks for your inputs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What are some career options can I transition into that doesn’t require doing on-calls and late night maintenances?
 I’ve been working as a sysadmin (linux, networking) and then a dev ops engineer (cloud stuff, some python for building tools and automation) for close to 10 years now. Started doing entry level stuff and then “senior” now according to my job title.
 However, one thing that has stayed consistent is that I’m always expected to do on-calls.
 Over the years, on-call has taken its toll on me. I lose weekends that could have been spent on hobbies, or with friends. I have chronic insomnia due to all irregular work hours and late night calls. In short, I constantly feel tired, lonely and mildly depressed.
 Asides from that, I enjoy the job and tinkering with the tech. I don’t think I am ready to leave this industry and do something completely different (like woodworking or something).
 From where I am, what are the possible jobs that I can transition into that doesn’t require on-calls?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I was watching a video on switches that stated a switch can store MAC Addresses in it's CAM table after there has been an attempt to communicate from A to B and then a reply from B to A. That would store the MAC addresses of both A and B, but if this is the first time either of these are communicating on the switch I assume it would have to broadcast the entire message from A to B to all ports (similar to a hub) and listen for where the reply comes to map B to it's proper port. If that is true could that be a security risk? 
 My other thought is that it would just be one frame (since after first frame it would all be routed directly A to B) so it might not be a huge deal. All of this for the main question of is it possible to have the switch send essentially a "discovery" frame to every port and map the replies so that it wouldn't have to send an initial message to all ports. 
 I also think I may be overthinking a relatively miniscule detail but it just caught my attention and was curious. I appreciate anyone taking the time to read and reply!

 Long story short
  
There is an MBAM server (reporting doesn't work tho)
 There is a GPO with Bitlocker settings
 Wanted to move Bitlocker to SCCM 
 Log said on clients that policy did not apply, as the workload for Endpoint Protection was switched ot Pilot Intune (crap)
 Looked at MDM... literally nothing set - just enable bitlocker drive encription
 
  
At this stage keys still get to AD, but it seems that most of the GPO settings won't really apply (e.g. 256 bit cipher is set there, but checking on the client with manage-bde the cipher is 128 bit.
 I think literally the MDM setting takes over and it soley turns on bitlocker, but doesn't really configure it to our needs.
 I'd happily move the slider over back to ConfigMgr, but Endpoint Protection has a lot of other stuff, defender firewall and what not...
 The pilot collection is however a huge one. With 95%+ of our clients... bummer.
 I am crying... any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Ars
  
Researchers recently discovered a Windows code-execution vulnerability that has the potential to rival EternalBlue, the name of a different Windows security flaw used to detonate WannaCry, the ransomware that shut down computer networks across the world in 2017.
 Like EternalBlue, CVE-2022-37958, as the latest vulnerability is tracked, allows attackers to execute malicious code with no authentication required. Also, like EternalBlue, it’s wormable, meaning that a single exploit can trigger a chain reaction of self-replicating follow-on exploits on other vulnerable systems. The wormability of EternalBlue allowed WannaCry and several other attacks to spread across the world in a matter of minutes with no user interaction required.
 But unlike EternalBlue, which could be exploited when using only the SMB, or server message block, a protocol for file and printer sharing and similar network activities, this latest vulnerability is present in a much broader range of network protocols, giving attackers more flexibility than they had when exploiting the older vulnerability.
  
Good news:
  
One potentially mitigating factor is that a patch for CVE-2022-37958 has been available for three months. EternalBlue, by contrast, was initially exploited by the NSA as a zero-day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 Context:
 I hack companies legally through called bug bounties. A few months ago, a Fortune 500 company gave me the opportunity to run phishing campaigns on their employees at a bug bounty event. 
 For some reason, they believed they were "unphishable" and offered a bounty for each employee I was able to phish. They were using Okta & Duo for MFA. 
 So, I bought a domain similar to theirs. I used Gophish & Mailgun to send an email, and Evilnginx to bypass MFA. I abused an XSS in one of their subdomains to redirect to a phishing page. Got 50+ pairs of credentials & Okta sessions, and full access to their AWS console within 2 minutes. I was blown away and terrified by how simple it was to compromise them. 
 Questions:
 I'm looking at how people are defending against phishing.
 From what I hear, Proofpoint and Mimecast don't stop most phishing emails. Security education can only be done so often and techniques are evolving.
 Vendor email compromise makes it even more difficult to prevent. 
 I know many people also run phishing simulations, but a recent study found "that embedded training during simulated phishing exercises, as commonly deployed in the industry today, does not make employees more resilient to phishing, but instead, it can have unexpected side effects that can make employees even more susceptible to phishing"
 You obviously can't expect everyone to be a tech expert and you can't expect email gateways to catch all phishing emails. If phishing simulations can have unexpected side effects, then what? Is trying to prevent phishing a hopeless pursuit?
 So, I'm curious:
  
How are you currently tackling phishing (including vendor email compromise)? 
 What providers do you use? (abnormalsecurity.com, inky.com, breachless.ai)?
 
 How often are you requiring security awareness training? With who & why them?
 How do you detect compromise? What do you do next?
  
Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all. I hope this is the right place to ask.
 I am developing what has turned into a small mmo. Every tick of the server sends an update packet for the actors to each connected client. There are other times a server will queue packets for other events to download partial compressed contents (zip) for the next area if the player does not have it. 
 The network code is very simple. We use UDP and have our own packet processor that handles queuing, waiting, sorting, chunking packets for various data-types types. 
 Lately more players are reporting a lag. The servers are taking longer to reply, some cannot start isolated P2P combat sessions when they could before, and so on. I have no expertise in this area except for the protocols I've read about and network architecture to for games. 
 Is it possible that ISP's are throttling unrecognized packet types? Since our packet structure is in-house, and each one varies, my hunch is the ISP is scrutinizing and scanning this traffic because it looks suspicious. I wonder if we wrap our packets in a well-known protocol like WebRTC for instance, if we'd get faster response times. 
 The code itself isn't the culprit because the players reporting the issues are using the latest client which has not changed in a year now. If it's possible the packets are being throttled, my next step will address that. But if it's not likely, then I will need to consider other factor causing online stability issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a question regarding single homed devices on a n9k vPC setup.
 Take for example a security server connected on the vPC primary n9k-1 on eth1/1. It has a single nic
 that terminates on a security VLAN on just that one switch. 
 If I leave all VLAN's trunked across the peer link then eth1/1 gets flagged as an orphan port. If I prune the security VLAN from the peer link then that flag is removed. 
 My question is...is there any downside to just leaving the VLAN on the peer link and having an orphan port? If the peer link goes down nothing would happen to an orphan port or non-orphan port by default and we want this port to stay up if the peer-link fails. If the entire switch fails then we would have to physically move the uplink to eth1/1 on the secondary so that traffic would leave out that path.
 Correct me if I am wrong, but I feel like the orphan port concept is more geared toward active/passive devices where you want to explicitly shut a port on a switch that has shut its vPC ports to prevent black holing of traffic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 My company has asked me to "Load balance the SSLVPN".
 Basically, we have two locations, Main and our Disaster Recovery location. Both of these locations run SonicWall setups with HA and Dual WAN failover. Both have SSLVPN enabled. We use Local + LDAP Auth & TOTP currently. We use Azure AD Connect to sync on prem AD to Azure. 
 The idea is this -
 If our Main site's SonicWall were to go down, the boss would like for users to be able to seamlessly connect to the disaster recovery site without needing to change binding/URLs.
 How it works now -
 If the Main SonicWall were to go down, users can type in the URL to the secondary (DR Site) SonicWall's VPN Office Portal. From here they can bind their TOTP, then log into NetExtender, change the "server" on Net Extender to the DR site's URL, and log in with their credentials using the DR sites 2FA token.
 How they want it to work - 
 Main SonicWall goes down, users go to the same URL and can use the same 2FA token to login. Users would not have to change the "Server" on Net Extender. 
 I'm planning on setting up Radius regardless, and I'm looking into alternatives like Azure AD 2FA with NPS, though I'm having a hard time finding articles/research to help me achieve what I need to accomplish here. Anyone able to offer suggestions/ link articles that could nudge me in the right direction? My experiencing with load balancing is not the best I'll admit.

We are looking to do an entire network refresh of our switches and access points in all of our plants, offices, and data center. Right now we have a hodge podge of manufacturers from all of our past acquisitions and we are finally moving forward with standardizing our network. We have met with a few vendors and done demos are looking to make our final decision on who to proceed with. 
 We're currently contemplating Cisco, Meraki, Fortinet, and Aruba. I'm attempting to make a list of items to evaluate and grade for each possible option and would love some of your feedback and ideas on what are some of your key features and criteria you'd look at when evaluating a new platform. Whoever we go with we will also purchase their NAC and that is a large consideration as well. Fortunately price isn't much of a deciding factor as we have excellent backing from upper leadership to move forward with this.
 Thank you all very much for any advice and input you have.
 tl;dr: What criteria should I consider when evaluating switch and AP vendors?

 I spent a long time getting good networking roles based on experience and demonstrable knowledge but now I really want to get some certs under my belt.
 Recently passed the JNCIS-ENT and loved that, was a good challenge (especially for someone so unused to exams).
 But now I'm thinking, well what next? My company I work for deploys a reasonable mix of Cisco and Juniper (mainly Cisco) - so I'm trying to decide whether to go for JNCIP straight away, get a few extra JNCIA certs (Sec/Dev) OR.... start on Cisco and get the CCNA. Or something else entirely!
 I should mention that it's not just a vanity project and that ultimately I'd want this to positively impact my career in the mid term.

Long story short, I'm trying to see what's out there that could be integrated to a indoor location system that my employer has developed. A lot of potential customers love the idea that we can integrate with their two-way radio system and are okay potentially having to purchase new radio fleets to do that but aren't excited when we mention the gateways we offer need to be installed with roughly the same frequency as their existing wireless solution to accurately track the beaconing devices. 
 Just trying to see what is out there to be potentially beneficial to prospective customers by keeping them from having to have a bunch of fixed infrastructure installed. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hey, how are you guys? i need advice for a network automation and cmdb architecture. we have a network which is until now manually managed without any kind of automation (>5k users, multiple sites, just ipv4). we use: 
  
hpe imc for switch management (VLANs, ports, configs)
 infoblox for dns/dhcp and ipam
 currently device42 as cmdb but are switching to i-doit
  
devices: 
  
firewalls are checkpoint devices
 switches and routers are mostly hpe cw7
 aps are aruba
 fortigates for site to site vpns
  
ticketing system: jiranow i have to provide accurate data for our new cmdb (we switch from dev42 to i-doit) and to create a network automation solution. 
  
how could a network automation architecture look like for networks like this in general? where should i start and how could a project plan look like?
 whats a simple nsot? should we use nautobot or use concepts like using git a data source (but how would you provide an API then)?
 how would you manage comware devices - open source solutions unfortunately lack support for comware compared to cisco/arista/juniper etc.
 whats your advice providing data from our devices and systems to i-doit? should we establish a nsot, aggregate data there and provide a single api to the cmdb? or a proxy script like netpalm? connecting the cmdb directly to the devices/systems? connecting the cmdb to hpe imc?
  
i would be thankful for any kind of advice!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoping for some advice on how to potentially isolate / pinpoint an issue on one of our internet circuits.
 The circuit is giving off odd performance issues. A typical speedtest via Oookla I'll not be able to get more than aoud 600Mbps down, upload I can peg out to 950 / 980Mbps. This is with a laptop directly connected to the providers NTE. Other speedtest sites can be terrible. UKFast / librespeed for example I'll struggle to get 100Mbps in fact any speedtest site other than Ookla gives terrible results.
 I've logged a support ticket with the provider and we did some iPerf tests during a change window. iperf tests from an endpoint on their network saw roughly a Gb up/down. so their response was that the circuit is fine.
 For me that only proved the bandwidth between those two points on their network can transmit 1Gbps and that there's an issue elsewhere. I've been advised by the provider that this is an 'internet issue' and there's nothing they can do.
 We have multiple 1Gbps internet circuits from the same provider, and an identical test from an alternate circuit shows me getting the full 1Gbps up/down, that to me proves it's something on their network.
 What other tests can I perform to help build my case with the supplier? 
 Appreciate any advice

 This is the year that I have blocked numerous people on phone call, WhatsApp and skype more than i have ever done in my life due to users trying to evade the helpdesk, or call me at odd hours or when I'm off work...
 For example, we all took a break from work 3 days ago for the Christmas holidays and we are resuming work in the 1st week of January but today alone I've received 6 phone calls and 2 messages from some users which I have obviously ignored, yesterday it was 2 phone calls and 1 email -the level of disrespect for my personal time off is huge huge huge
 it has gotten so bad that i no longer answer 90% of phone calls from numbers that i don't have saved in my contacts. If i receive a phone call from an unsaved number i ignore it and do a quick look-up to see if its some person from work, if it's not i answer i.e if they call back again or i will call the person
 next year im just gonna be ruthless and more strict with this thing. When i joined the org 3 years ago i thought some of the seniors are just grumpy fellows who dont like to instantly and joyfully help some users (not that they are always like that) but there would be instances where i thought a user was given a cold shoulder -but now i seem to start getting it

I've yet to come across a satisfying way of dealing with the inevitable issue of multiple people with the same name. Like a lot of places we currently base our user accounts on the given name, however I've found in the past that numbering subsequent similar accounts creates confusion with emails etc, and can also create a feeling of hierarchy.
 What would be your ideal system of naming user accounts? Do you have please methods of dealing with this issue?
 Given that we've already issued many accounts which are basically just the person's name, do you have an original way of handling "john.smith2"?

 I'm not sure how to correctly ask this question, but here goes:
 I recently set up an Ubuntu server and shared a drive with Samba to my Macbook. I confirmed that it is working, however, I decided to change the user owner of the shared folder, now I'm unable to 'forget' the current network and re-add the drive with a different log in.
 I try to remove the credentials from the keychain and then do the Go > Connect to Server routine to get the share again, but when I try to import it, it doesn't ask for user or pass, it just automatically logs in as the previous credentials and they pop up again in the keychain.
 I hope this makes sense, could I please get some assistance with this?

 There is a group policy in place for our O365 that prevents older word files (I.E Word 95) from being opened. From what I understand, this Group Policy was implemented aprox 3 years ago. This is a very sensible Group Policy and I don't want to change it. 
 However, I've also discovered that there appears to be a raft of Word 95 documents still within the business. IT never converted the pre-existing Word 95 documents on our 8-or-so file servers. 
 It appears the plan to deal with this was to be 100% reactive. If a user cannot open a document, they raise a ticket and the HelpDesk would manually convert the file. I believe the idea was that the Word 95 files used within the business would eventually get converted this way and this will become a non-problem. But 3-years on, this still seems to drive calls to the HelpDesk.
 I'd rather pro-actively convert all our existing Word 95 files and call it a day. My problem is it's probably been a decade since I've needed to do a mass conversion of Word documents like this. And so far my Google-Fu has been failing me.
 Does anyone here have recent experience with a utility that'll scan a file server and convert old Word documents en-mass?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good day all, in our organization that i do tech support we have a licensed/preactivated windows 10 ISO that we use for clean installations on user PCs, the ISO is now a couple of years old (2015) such that after each clean installation we have to give the PCs a lot of hours to upgrade the windows 10 versions several times to get to the most recent Windows 10 versions, and who knows after how many days or weeks will the Win 11 upgrade option appear -some production apps don't even run on the dated windows versions
 ​
 How can i "upgrade" this Windows 10 ISO to Windows 11 so that each time i run it it installs Windows 11 -roughly 80% of our users were upgraded to Windows 11 on the new laptops acquired and should there be an issue that requires a windows reinstallation it would be a pain and great time consumer to start with that outdated ISO
 ​
 EDIT: I don't know the key for the Windows 10 ISO that we use, when I joined the organization I was handed the ISO file as part of work 'tools'. i don't deal with a key during or after installation

 documentation atm is a disaster, being spread across multiple OneNotes. I finally convinced management to invest in a good documentationplatform, and now I have to choose one.
 My first thought was confluence, but reading up on it I am starting to have second thoughts: slow, cluncky, atlassian, steep learning curve and what not,... I read some good things about Nuclino, but I was wondering what this sub have to say (about this or other platforms).
 I know confluence works together with Jira. We do some in-house development so Jira could be useful to us. But it's not like we are a codingshop that has multiple external clients that are in need of storyboards and such.
 requirements:
  
saas (yup, not even selfhosted on azure)
 kanban
 documentation
 some projectmanagement..
  
thx for the help!

 Pretty new to this and I'm searching for an easy way to backup up to 10TB of data for a mid sized company. Let's say I have this data on a server in some RAID. Is it still a viable way to do a full backup once a week to a seperate drive and store it off-site? Wouldn't this take forever? As of today the company uses SharePoint which is quite problematic because it works dynamically and messes with the data sometimes. I want to do a backup once a week and not everytime something is changed. This backup is just for the case the office burns down so the RAID is destroyed in its entirety.
 Thanks!

 I have a lot (~100k in last 24hrs) of events 4771, 4625 and 4776 mixed together, for only one machine account. The reasons is always "User logon with misspelled or bad password" or "This is either due to a bad username or authentication information".
 It is Windows 7 Pro, fully updated (with no possibility to upgrade to Win10 due to lack of compatibility of installed software).
 All our domain controllers have installed Oct 2022 cumulative udpate.
 Computer is available in domain, I haven't noticed any issues using it , everyone can log on it, GPO are working. First thought - it's Win7, maybe old kerberos encryption used, so I've checked if computer is using DES / RC4 encryption - seems like it's not.
 I cannot confirm if this issue existed before November patch, I've seen it few days ago. Shoud I be concerned? Any ideas?

 I will preface this by saying that i'm new to networking and dont have so many years under my belt (1 year alltogheter, 6 months technical support B2B, 6 months technical support B2C).
 I'm currently working with a customer who has issues with bandwitdh, it is a 1gig link. The customer has two routers from us that are configured with redundancy (VRRP). Recently we tried to configure another gateway on their equipment and we suddenly see a increase in bandwitdh.
 When the VRRP group address is configured on the interface to the customer they only manage to measure 50 down and 50 up, while if we change the IP to one of the available IP's in the range, for example the next IP, the customer suddenly measures 900/900..
 The issue only seems to persist on one of the VLANS that is configured, with a /29 net
 As long as they configure one of the other IP's in the range as their default gateway they have no problems, but if they use the VRRP IP the problem appear.
 My understanding is that for the failover to function properly the customer has to use the VRRP IP as their default gateway, or else the clients dont know where to send their packets if R1 fails.
 I would greatly appreciate any tips for this problems.
 Keep in mind that I am new to this so my explanation may be lacking.

 I've been using Greenshot the screen capture program for years because unlike other programs I tried it was really simple and intuitive to use.
 ​
 For a couple months ago it's causing a problem of capturing my screen of the past; to be precise when I play borderless games and do a screen-capture, it captures the screen of my game when I last alt-tapped instead of my current screen.
 ​
 Is there a fix to this? Also are there any easy screen capture program not just trailered for streamers but for casual usage? It would be nice if it's simple to use for a layman and can capture videos too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for a small fintect business (around 100 employees) as a data engineer. The majority of the company's key data is stored on a 1 TB prod Azure sql database (with matching dev and QA, and another smalled 300 GB SQL Server on-prem DB. A few analysts do power BI reporting off these data sources, and one of them connects to a pricing app our sales team uses. We are a microsoft shop basically.
 We are trying to implement true data management program, knowing that we have these needs but also wanting to cover some that we aren't even aware we need. We do know we want:
 - Data dictionary/catalog so analysts know what are the main tables that have the data they want power BI reports and our own compliance
 - Some way to assign data stewards who can keep the data catalog up to date
 - Ways to tag data as PHI, or what it's retention time is, to encourage privacy and retention compliance
 - Seeing lineage of our pipelines
 - Features that help consolidate records and the 'golden record' pursuit
 - In general anything helping us get to the goal of practicing data management.
 The obvious answer is Microsoft Purview, and it seems to click a lot of boxes and we are a microsoft shop, but I'm worried about the pricing. It seems like it could get expensive really quickly with the pay for use model, beyond any value it brings. We have a reasonable budget for data management but it's going to be hard to justify huge bills for what to most people will just be a data catalog.
 Other's I've looked at are data.world, altan, collibri, and alation. Then I see these open source versions with apache atlas or linkedin datahub and wonder if I should be going the free route and spin something entirely myself? I'm not trying to turn this into a sales post because I am skeptical of all of them despite knowing we need something :)
 Has anyone solved similar data management wants with any of these tools? Or have any general advice.

 I just want to know if this is common place or if maybe I'm just too distrustful and this is something genuine.

 I had noticed that all my 920s take a long time to boot! We just keep the .bin in the bootflash directory for it to load upon boot. 
 It takes roughly 20 minutes for them to boot into the IOS XE CLI and start passing data. 
 I am just curious if that is normal, or if someone else has run into this, and found some adjustments that minimize the boot time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys. Got a strange one that I am struggling with. We have a setup where has a pretty recent workstation with an AMD Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM and an AMD Radeon Pro W5500 on Windows 11. The GPU as far as I can tell is the issue here, which is basically a cut down AMD RX 5700. When using the system normally, everything is fine, but when using it as an RDP host, connecting to it via a system with a Quadro K620 and a 4K monitor, it becomes a laggy mess.
 ​
 In group policy I have enabled the following:
 ​
 1 - Prioritize H.264/AVC 444 graphics mode for Remote Desktop Connections
 2 - Configure H.264/AVC hardware encoding for Remote Desktop Connections
 3 - Use Hardware Graphics adapters for all remote desktop services sessions
 ​
 I have this setup on another workstation that is currently using an old GTX 1080, and performance is excellent (I get random artifacting every once in a while, but overall it's usable). For testing purposes I installed this card into the test system, and performance improved considerably. When checking stats on hardware utilisation, the Nvidia card shows GPU encode activity, whilst the W5500 (and my RX 5700 from my home PC that I brought in for testing) never show any GPU encode activity.
 What is interesting is that the GPU has no problem encoding when using something like OBS.
 ​
 Any ideas what I can do here to improve RDP performance on a 4K monitor using an AMD GPU? Latest AMD drivers are currently installed. I would rather not have to replace the GPU if I could avoid it, it should have the ability to encode properly. Suggestions appreciated.

 I do quant related stuff and needed to build a basic web app for work. I made a short Python script, and used Streamlit to host it locally. It takes data from yahoo finance and does stuff with it. Nothing complicated. 
 It was working fine a week ago, but now when I run it, I get the following error (not verbatim but close):
 Cannot verify identity: self signed certificate in certificate chain
 The app loads (in Chrome) but throws this error along with others and doesn’t grab the data. 
 I’ve been trying to figure out the solution for probably 4 hours now and haven’t made any progress. I can’t continue the project until I solve this. It also doesn’t let me install packages. 
 If someone could hold my hand and walk me through this I would be immensely grateful. This shit is literally rocket science to me.
 I already asked in stackoverflow but nobody answered

 I asked it for a RESTful API to accept an incoming webhook, check the data for inclusion of a string, extract a network address from the data, and make another external API call to update a list.
 It gave me probably 80% of the structure right off the bat. Decided to do a flask server with python3, in development mode. I asked it to please have that run in production mode. Boom, updated script and instructions for installing gunicorn along with the recommendation of running a reverse proxy in front of it. Asked it for http basic auth, boom first try. Not difficult things to do, but certainly easier to just ask and verify the answer.
 It definitely isn't perfect and will confidently give you some BS. But it's remarkable how often just calling out the BS will make it reconsider, apologize, and then fix it.
 I'd say it took a 2 day project down to about 5 hours. 40-50% of the code was written by me in the end, but that's damn a damn good improvement for one tool.
 Apparently there are already vscode plugins for it.

 There’s currently 2 Fortigates in HA with an aggregate interface configured that has port 1 as a member, this connects to an aggregate on a Meraki stack (2 switches, port 1 on each switch - this is a single aggregate interface). From what I understand, HA syncs the config between the Fortigates so each Fortigate will have its own aggregate interface - it looks like when this was first configured it was thought that port 1 on each firewall would be a member of the single aggregate interface. Assuming this is correct, each aggregate on …]]></summary>

 School holidays are upon us and this means people are bringing kids (and ipads, and phones, and Nintendo Switches...) to work and demanding the WiFi so the kids have something to do all day. 
 Fair enough, I get it. We connect them to the guest WiFi, which is segmented from the network. Only problem (for them) is that the guest wifi is throttled at 5MBps and now the kids are complaining to their dads/mums/anyonewhowilllisten about how the WiFi sucks. This means their parents can't get any work done so they're complaining to me to "fix it" so Johnny can run his games/app/movie without disturbing them.
 I've explained that we throttle to protect the work connection but twice I've been told to "put them on the staff SSID". I've also explained the security risks associated with adding BYODs to the staff network and that this contravenes policy. 
 I'm not fearing an order to "connect them anyway" 'coz I have the autonomy/authority to reject that order but I am concerned about generating a hostile work environment. 
 I could increase the throttle to 10Mb. Short of that, any other ideas?

 This business is in what looks like condo's. They will get ATT Fiber coming in, and will get a router with that. Beyond that, I can do whatever, but there IS existing wiring to the walls, both upstairs and down, to ethernet jacks, carrying cat 6.
 The existing backbone is The panel, Existing, is a punchdown block, telephone style ish. I don't know the proper term. The ATT router will be left alone and installed as a stand alone piece, with wireless, but that's not sufficient for wireless for the whole place.
 SO....From the ATT router, I would like to have 2 switches come right off of that. THEN, I would like to terminate the cat 6 with rj45 ends, THEN plug those into one switch for the upstairs and one for the down. I can't see room to mount them, but It might be fine. There is NO give in the leftover from the block. THEN on each level, plug a wirless router into the switch to give better wireless.
 Beyond that, I am plugging 10-16 computers into each floor level at the wall, and one wired networked printer per level. I will manage the devices from the ATT router, but can do from each wireless router as well.
 I'm sure I'm not thinking of about 15 things.
 I'm trying to add a photo of the existing bloc, but this won't let me?? I am attempting to draw this up for my own concept understanding as well. It's going to take me a little while.
 Can anyone visualize this, and offer design advice? Am I at least on the right track?

It contains our pricing, inventory, shipping, point of sale, manufacturing data, and lots of other info that I'm not currently privy to (working on it, but the disorganization of data is a whole other problem).
 I don't hate the Salesforce portion that our sales team uses, and I understand it has a fairly robust API ecosystem. 
 Does anyone have resources to research or any experience switching a(n) SME from a shit ERP to a less-shit one? The current solution is untenable, and our senior IT staff are getting quite senior. The underlying business (wholesale/distributing/manufacturing) is quite sound, so funding isn't as much of an issue. Buy-in from senior management/board of directors is the bigger problem (as always). 
 We are a 100-500 person company, NA-based USA HQ with ~10 locations in USA and Canada, and our aging workforce is a threat to irreparable loss of institutional knowledge.
 Thanks in advance for any help.
 Edit: Consensus opinion seems to be that ERPs are just shit. Which is what I feared. Time to get the checkbook out and pray. If anyone can DM me a recommendation to a decent ERP change consultant, that would be nice

I want to invest sometime in learning about how the networks are designed probably from a practical perspective, as in, say, how would you design a data center, if you have say N number of servers, how many tiers in the leaf-spine topology you would prefer , which underlay to use, etc. I have a familiarity with Cisco NXOS and ACI and since aiming for a certification (CCIE, CCNP, DCACI etc) would probably encourage to continue the learning on a regular basis and also is a good target to aim for, does anyone here have suggestions on which certification track to consider or even which book I should start with. Thanks 
 [As a side-note, I even didn't have enough clarity on what Bridge Domain is, why prefer one protocol over the other for underlay etc).

I know the title will pay off but the money would help with extra classes towards extra certs then a job hop. Just wondering if you had a choose what would you guys pick?

 The standard solution is O365, GSuit or something like Box.com. The problem is, management doesn’t like transferring business data over to these companies. Solutions where the data remains on premise are preferred. I understand! 
 Nextcloud is usually considered in these scenarios. I am not an expert. I have used nextcloud for personal use, and still learning it (eg, learning about different installation options). I also read a lot about it online. I personally like the software, but from my experience in the past years, I am a bit worried about updates getting broken between major versions, security vulnerabilities with a complex PHP app, and bugs impacting user experience. The web interface will remain open to LAN. 
 Do you have any experience with nextcloud in a small business scenario? How secure, robust and reliable is it, as a working replacement to something like Box.com?
 Anyone deploys nextcloud in production?
 On the other hand, I see governments in Germany and France and various institutions use it. I suppose they audited and vetted the code before adopting it. If it’s good for them, it might be good for small businesses too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I have a peculiar problem that needs solving. I have undertaken a project that requires data to be moved from multiple locations (let's say 10 for example) to a Central storage server. The problem is that none of the locations will be online, and cannot be online ever, so data must be moved physically by transporting the disks to the central location and unloading the data to the server.
 The satellite locations will have RAID-1 storage pools of 2 disks. Each location will have 4 pools. So in total we have 40 pools of 80 disks that need to be transported to another location, somehow mounted and have all their data copied over to the storage server.
 This will need to happen every month for a year.
 Have you ever done something like this? How would you approach it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Edit***I've figured out my method of looking at this isn't going to happen. It's not a network limitation it's the software. There's an online process and constant handshake that needs to be maintained and so my idea won't work. But this has opened up other ideas that are theoretically easier. Appreciate the responses!!
 ***Original
 If I am a complete idiot for this line of thinking please don't hesitate to let me know.
 I am currently running two identical separate networks (Main and Backup) each with only two machines on them - one "controller" and one "server". These networks are very static both logically and physically. Always the same computers.
 Everything is on the same subnet and the controllers can be any IP I want but the servers have to be the same IP. If they're not the same IP I have to do a ridiculous amount of reconfiguring every time I copy things from Main to Backup.
 Here's my question:
 Is there a way I can send the same TCP/IP to two identical networks or IP addresses?
 I was thinking about getting a 4-port mini PC and trying to use PureData to create a routing system and trying to use Mac addresses but maybe there's an easier way? Or maybe this won't ever work at all (because of what I say next)?
 I realize this is a situation that networking is generally designed to avoid but this isn't a typical data network - it's a live show TCP/IP based control network with no external connections and/or surprises. I'm hoping I can find a way to make this work!

We ain’t that stupid to self-support it, so we applied for the renewal last week. We received a quote from the vendor and to our astonishment, it’s around 20% of what we paid initially. For just one year! 
 Question(s): What’s a typical price for the support contract? Should we expect extended hardware maintenance included? How is HCI different from SAN? In case we’ll decide to switch to HCI, which is another option we consider.

Its gotten out of hand and unbearable (just the damn glitching is one main reason). The reason is we have very specific things we need that google sheets does well, does anyone know a CRM that can do all of the below (we use freshdesk for CS already so covered there)
 ​
 1) Auto import orders as soon as they are made (hopefully every CRM)
 2) Attach photos to a specific order (be able to upload different images directly on a clients order that can be seen by employees)
 3) Have different bench marks employees can check off on each order (submitted to suppliers, order approved, declined)
 4) Be able to send emails for updates on a specific order (remind X employee to check this order again in 3 days, remind me to check for X in 5 days for this order)
 5) Easy to use and a design that will make all of the above easy to do
 ​
 if someone can recommend a CRM that can do this all I will be especially happy and maybe offer a small reward :) thanks everyone

While the team is hitting all the right notes (in fact exceeding expectations in some areas), I’m not sure I want it. I’m feeling burned out and the farther I get from ‘mashing the keys’ the more unhappy I seem to be. Has anyone else experienced this? I’ve just received an offer to go back to a more technical role and kind of feel a bit of the golden handcuffs as the offer is 20% less. For those of who have felt this, did you go back to making a bit less coin for more of a happiness play?

 I'm in a competition called CCDC (Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition), which puts you in a "Real" business, and has tasks(keeping a server and webpage up), patching your firewall, "setting up" printers, and other day to day stuff while under attack from Red Hats. All that just to say, I was looking for advice and help in finding services online/books that can assist me in preparing for this competition. 
 I've started doing some CTF stuff, learning from hackthebox academy, stack overflow, my team mates, and coaches.
 I personally will be monitoring the network(ports open, network traffic, services running, and firewalls) and any resources that covers that would be amazing. 
 Edit start: The OS is released a week before the start, but most the time it's a well known distribution of linux(normally ubuntu) and/or Windows Servers.
 This competition isn't until February, so I have a bit of time to learn!
 Edit end.
 Thanks!
 (sorry if this is the wrong group, real nervous to post anything online 0-0)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 Not a sysadmin, looking for some thoughts on a high quality kinda future proof, 10g switch for the following gear for mainly file sharing.
 - Up to 10 x 10g users (Mostly 10GBase-t because of short distance and our current NICs, I didn't know SFP runs cooler otherwise that'd been my choice for nics in the past, such as shame)
 - IXsystems All flash Truenas R20 with dual 10G Base_t (Once fully loaded can support more throughput and possibly can upgrade nics to dual 25g or more)
 Options:
  
S5860-20SQ (Seems packed with features, good price and expandability, I like how it has support for 25g and 40g which my truenas might need in the near future. But it needs transivers for my current RJ45 equipment)
 HPE Aruba Instant On 1960 12XGT (I guess software/support is better than FS, not sure? Has both copper and fiber)
 Cisco Business 350 (I didn't hear good things about it on reddit, seems like not really enterprise quality cisco)
 QNAP QSW-M1208-8C or similar. No comments, I have one and it worked well in a different gear. It's cheaper than the others but I don't want the cheapest now. I want the most reliable that has room for growth.
 CRS312-4C+8XG-RM Lots of great features and it's cheap but again cost is not my main concern

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok, I’m dealing with some super old systems I need to migrate from Nutanix to ESX. The reason is the Nutanix block is so freaking old it’s massively failing. Like I told them 2 years ago they needed to get off this shit as it was showing issues, we couldn’t even get extended support, and everything else in shop is esx.
 We’ll I’m running in to an issue now that seems to be server 2008r2 + VMware tools related.
 On all these systems when installing vmwaretools 12.X+ everything seems to work, but if the server hasn’t been used in a bit it takes a moment for the network to “wake up”. What I mean is that if you log on to the console you’ll need to do a ping -t and let it fault for 10-15 times before it starts responding and then works fine from there on out. I tried the last supported version of tools I could find, 11.3, but this didn’t seem to rectify the issue.
 I’ve also made sure to remove the Nutanix guest tools and everything I could think of that might be interfering.
 I’m not seeing this behavior on why if the 2012R2, 2016, win10, etc…. VMs I’ve migrated. Just the 2008R2. 
 Anyone ran in to this before or have any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have some Cisco M5 servers that are running ESXi. These servers have 2 x X710 Dual Port NICs. We are noticing that in some of our load tests, we start seeing our dropped packets start to increment. When we dump the nic statistics in ESXi, we see Rx Missed counters are increasing. Someone told us that the Ring Buffers were dropping packets, and that the solution was to enable Receive Side Scaling (RSS). So we looked into that. 
 Inside of the ESXi operating system (VMWare proprietary Linux), the adaptors are using a driver named i40en. The driver is loaded as a kernel module. Per VMWare docs, enabling RSS involves passing parameters to the kernel module. We noticed there were two RSS Parameters (DRSS and RSS), which led us down a path of trying to figure out which one we needed to be configuring. We learned that there are two types of Receive Side Scaling: NetQ (RSS), and Default Queue RSS, the latter being newer. Since we didn't see any mention of DRSS in the Intel X710 documentation, we proceeded to set the RSS values to 4 queues per adaptor. We re-ran the test expecting a Eureka result, but nope - we still see the Rx Missed. 
 On this issue, we keep flapping between VMWare (who owns the OS), Cisco (who owns the server) and Intel (who makes the X710 adaptor). Can anyone shed any insight on this Rx Missed issue, and point us in a direction to go down that might fix this issue? We have to figure this out before we can allow a service to be rolled out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay so looking for a bit of advice here I've previously done roles where I was the sole IT support for the site, which was fine, I always was able to escalate if needed:
 Currently joined an international company where various IT roles are segmented, I'm (IT Ops) but we have a production network team, a internal network team, infra team, AD/Exchange team, even a procurement team all within IT. (When I joined I thought great!) 
 The issue I have is I'm currently running 3 projects which require communication accross multiple teams, and sometimes even simple tasks like shared mailbox setup take forever as they come to me first, and instead of just doing it.. I have to send it to the messaging team, then have no visibility of the case, so chasing up what I can't see for a relatively simple case becomes a headache. 
 On the other hand one of the other projects involves Setting up bespoke software (provided by the vendor) on a server provided by the production network team (None of whom are based in my country) and I cannot even install the software as their server is on their network, and their vlan that I have no access to, RDP copy paste is disabled etc 
 This meant I had to log a case with them to request them to open SMB traffic/share to our network so I can transfer the files. To which they said no. And then messaged my boss asking what was taking so long... 
 This isn't really a rant, some of the teams mentioned above are very helpful (rather some if their members are) and I have a good working relationship with them, however the above is a regular occurrence. 
 Basically I'm looking for advice on how other people manage this if they are in the same situation, or any tips, cheers in advance!

I finally have a working build with OSPF as the IGP and RSVP signaled LSPs connecting epipes into l2circuits. I found it strange that the official documentation on both sides said that it wasn’t possible it works just fine when you add proper compensation. I’m sure smarter people than myself have done it in the past but I’m very proud of my config. Anybody else ever deal with trying to merge entire networks like that.

 I really need to bump that up. They want $10 per mb for a 500mb line. 
 Is this really what this shit costs these days? 10 dollars per mb or $5,000 a month for a 500gb line? I feel IGF.

 Then I asked ChatGPT and... the answer was perfect.
 This is what I had after asking "How can I automatically set up out of office messages for disabled accounts in a specific OU ?" :
  # Replace "OU=Disabled Accounts,DC=contoso,DC=com" with the distinguished name of your OU $ou = "OU=Disabled Accounts,DC=contoso,DC=com" # Get a list of disabled accounts in the OU $disabledAccounts = Get-ADUser -Filter {Enabled -eq $False} -SearchBase $ou # Set the out-of-office message for each disabled account foreach ($account in $disabledAccounts) { Set-MailboxAutoReplyConfiguration -Identity $account.SamAccountName -AutoReplyState Enabled -ExternalMessage "I am currently out of the office and will not be able to respond to your message. I will get back to you as soon as possible." -InternalMessage "I am currently out of the office and will not be able to respond to your message. I will get back to you as soon as possible." } 
 Now, I know the tool isn't flawless, however, have you guys considered using it just like you do with Google to solve these kind of things ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Robocopy (RC) for many years... so long I don't want to say. That said, I am currently running a copy on a Windows 11 machine with its version of RC that comes preinstalled. I started noticing my /PURGE /NOCOPY options on batch command lines didn't seem to be working the same anymore. (subdirs were no longer being purged) So I added /S /E and it started copying zillions of files & directories instead of removing files. I verified there were a lot of new folders I did not want there, that weren't there prior to changing those parameters. I removed the /E and tested again, it looked like it was creating new directories, but when I looked at the destination it wasn't doing that anymore (like it think it should be working)
 I did see a blurb on the new Win11 RC version help page about them changing what happens on a certain system folder with /PURGE, but saw nothing about other changes to it.
 I did NOT go back and test older version, so maybe I only thought it was working and removing files from sub-folders if they weren't on the source. Don't know, and I won't invest any more time in that.
 So now with the added /S, but no /E its removing files/folders in sub-directories like I wanted/expected and not copying stuff.
 The /E option on that /PURGE line really screws the pooch! JFYI. -Bill

 I was following come Cisco instructions to setup unified messaging to use OAuth2 authentication. Part of the process was to assign the Application Impersonation management role to the unified messaging services account. 
 I ran this command 
 New-ManagementRoleAssignment -Name: <RoleName> -Role:ApplicationImpersonation -User:' <Account> '
 After running, I ran a Get-ManagementRoleAssignment and I can see the role name and account, but under RoleAssigneeName and EffectiveUserName , I'm getting what looks like an object ID instead of what I was expecting to see...which was an email address. 
 I'm note sure if it was because I didn't use the quotes for the account...I used User: <Account>
 instead of User:' <Account> '
 I'm an extreme newbie when it comes to powershell so I've got the following questions:
  
Is this even a problem?
 is it the lack of quote marks that caused this?
 Are there commands I can run to change these to the email address?
  
Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 We at FilesNow are in the process of developing a new file sharing and storage service, and we're looking for some feedback and suggestions from the sysadmin community.
 What are some key features that you look for in a file sharing and storage service? In your experience, what has made a file sharing service stand out to you?
 We are aiming to create a service that is reliable, easy to use, and has good security features. Some other features that we're considering include the ability to share files with external collaborators, integration with other tools and platforms, and the ability to manage permissions and control access to files. Additionally, we want to offer robust file storage capabilities, including the ability to store and access large files, as well as support for various file formats.
 We'd love to get your thoughts on what features would be most useful for sysadmins and what would make our file sharing and storage service stand out in the market.
 Thanks in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'll get right into my question:
 I've been working for 1 company for ~1,5 years by now. 6 months as anykey, 10 as system administrator. We have a small team of 3 people: me, lead system administrator and team leader. Company consist of 100 people in architecture department and about 100 in first-line tech support.
 Soo, I really like my job, my team have amasing chemistry, I can do almost all tasks independently, but I think that I'm sitting on the same place in terms of knowledge. All of our servers are almost 100% windows-based, and I do usually some simple things like managing users in AD, some share-server based stuff and of course managing problems with user's pc, but nothing extraordinary.
 And what I'm thinking that if I tried to switch a job now, I wouldn't pass an interview. I know how to do things but it is usually limited and on sense-based level rather solid knowledge.
 I'm feeling like I'm back on square one when I haven't got a job at all and I waster 1,5 years for nothing. 
 In advance I'll say that I try to learn new things of course, I try to make a note in Obsidian daily about networking and so on, but I can admit that I'm really not the brightest system administrator, so many things are quite hard for me.
 My question is it really I have imposter syndrome or is it a normal state? And, I know it is hard to give answer to that, what can I do to improve me so I can be valuable asset on a market?
 ​
 Many thanks in advance, and sorry for any possible language mistakes - I tried to catch them all, but who knows)

All went well apart from domain joining which only worked on Ethernet. The WiFi deets are correct because users can sign in immediately after provisioning is finished. The only thing I can think is happening is that it tries to domain join before adding the WiFi profile?

After some googling I came to conclusion that there is no way around having to own a range of IP addresses that I can assign to individual hosted applications. However, it seems that getting a range of addresses is both too hard and expensive and probably impossible for an individual (I do not want to create a company just for a hobby service). For example, my RIR is APNIC and the membership application requires corporate contacts.
 What is the easiest way to obtain a range of IPv4 or IPv6 addresses as an individual?

 I configured a trunk port from the fortiswitch to the pfsense firewall with native vlan 1 and allowed(tagged) vlan 20. This works as expected. I can still access the switch on the default network, and I can add vmware vms to vlan 20 and everything works as expected.
 However, I cannot replicate this on my Juniper. I attempted the same configuration (trunk port with native vlan 1 and tagged vlan 20) but when I do this I can no longer access the switch IP nor ping it (it doesnt appear to work on either 1 or 20). What am I missing that I need to configure for this to work on my Juniper? 
 Below is the output on the interface being used as the trunk.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we had our company (law firm) Christmas party. While our IT department is a coworker and I + our boss who mainly does infrastructure, we are a company with a single office and about 160 people so until now we got by. Today the CEO dropped the bomb that we will expand from 1 to 3 offices over 12 months with around 40-50 new people for the new offices.
 My coworker and I are in the middle of organising and redesigning many processes and polices, together with a new infrastructure for a new software and implementing an intranet so 2023 was already packed. With the news we have to do the work that we planned on padding out over the year (also to be able to do our day to day tasks) in the next 4 months so we can develop solutions to our new issues with having more than 1 office (most of our infrastructure is in our local server rooms so we have to think if this will suffice).
 I am genuinely scared of the sudden rise in scope (neither our grown infrastructure nor our company policies and culture are, as of today, fit for the new environment), but also excited to not only execute the plan but also co-developing that plan

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I surprisingly couldn't find a script for this anywhere, so I wrote one myself.
 This script recursively converts all .rar and .zip archive files to the superior .7z format, set for highest compression.
  
Can specify formats to convert (in the VARIABLES section in the top of the script). Defaults are .rar and .zip
 
After each file is converted, the original archive is deleted, leaving only the new .7z archive
 
Logs by default to c:\logs\ (can be changed in the VARIABLES section)
 
Starts from the directory it was launched from and recurses down subdirectories from that point
 
 >> Script on Github <<
 I used this script to convert a lot of old log files we're required to keep around from Zip to 7-Zip, which saved ~380 GBs of space by the time it was done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I finally implemented MFA two weeks ago for our company after having a 'battle' with management for over two years. Everything went fine and already 95% of our users have set it up.
 This week I got a message when signing in to the Azure portal that there was a new conditional access policy created. I checked the CA policies and saw that a new 'Require MFA for admins' policy was created. In the logs it said this was done by an admin account of our MSP who does some support work for us.
 We didn't get noticed or gave the MSP an assignment to set this up. So I messaged our contact at the MSP and after some research from their side they say the CA policy was created automatically without their intervention.
 I can see clearly in the logs that their admin account created the CA policy but I'm not too experienced with Azure and CA policies. Is automatically creating a CA policy with MFA even possible in Azure AD?

 I understand that this greatly depends on size of the network, scalability, certification-requirements, etc. - but I want your input. I personally like using the firewall for a single pane-of-glass and ease-of-use.
 ​
 So - What do you think? Should L3 be managed on the firewall or at a core switch? Why? Change my mind!

Just wondering what kind of success/burn people have with them. To go with a <3K optic and it burn you and have to replace it with 80K optics is a pretty big gut punch. Even Cisco branded optics fail, so some failure doesn't scare me due to redundant links. I just don't want to be constantly swapping them either or worry about MTTF's lining up like you get with raid arrays.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So i have this topology in a mininet emulation:
 h1/h2 ---- s2 ---- s1 ---- s3 ---- h3/h4
 All links are restricted to 1Gbps.
 When i use iperf3 to send TCP traffic from h1 to h3, it gets close to that bw and everything seems fine. When i create two concurrent flows that go e.g. from h1 to h3 or both from h1 to h3 and from h1 to h4, the bandwidth they get also adds up to close to 1Gbps.
 However, when i concurrently have a flow running from h1 to h3 and one from h2 to h4, their summarized bandwidth is way worse and almost never exceeds 300 Mbps.
 There are some more retransmissions shown in iperf3 in this last scenario as well, but i don't really get why that is and i think that just the workings of congestion control causing a decrease of link utilization to below 30% seems unlikely.
 The retransmissions come in small bursts and those appear only every few seconds on average, which also seems too large of an in-between time to have me think that packet drops are causing this. This sounds more like timeouts, but then there should be quite some ACKs being dropped and why would that be?
 Cubic is configured on all end hosts. RTT measured by ping is mostly between 80 and 130 microseconds.
 Before i dig down further into the depths of congestion control (calculating timeouts and looking at whether the ACKs make it in time), i was wondering whether someone had any insights on whether that is normal behaviour or what else could be happening.
 Both memory and CPU utilization of any of the cores stay below 100%.

 Some people say their IP geolocation is wrong, but even if it’s not accurate, as long as it’s consistent, it could still be useful if you get a notification showing a login attempt from a new IP address in a completely different location.
 Some users may not like it even if it’s accurate because they will feel like their employer is tracking their movements.

 Initial thought: Two Netgear M4300 with 12-port Copper (for the network traffic) and 12-port SFP+ DAC (for the storage traffic) but read that copper is hot and higher latency. So will get a switch with only SFP+ ports. DAC will be used in the server room and fiber to the 48-port switches that are through out the building.
 Does it make sense to just run a single SFP+ DAC from each server to each switch that will handle both network traffic and storage traffic or do I run two cables to each switch from each server and split the traffic? 
 I know Netgear is not enterprise grade hardware but $2,500 vs $12,000 for an Aruba 3810M seems like a major difference. Any vendors that are between the two as far as cost and feature set? For that price difference, I can have a spare Netgear on hand.
 For my DR site, I plan on having a duplicate TRUENAS R10 and 3x DL360's servers and nothing else. Can I eliminate the switches entirely and just run 3 DAC cables to the TrueNAS and plug the 3 servers directly into my two Fortinet 80F firewalls via GigE?
 Thanks

 I reached out to Threat Locker support to see about how to remove their product when tamper protection is enabled. They said it cannot be done. They provided me this link https://threatlocker.kb.help/uninstalling-the-threatlocker-agent/ however it doesn't help if you don't have access to the old MSP's portal to disable tamper protection. Has anyone run into this issue? Is there a way to boot into safe mode and rip this product out of the system and registry, offline if needed?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I posted earlier in the week about the lack of technical questions in my 1st interview. The next day got word the company wanted to do a 2nd interview. 2nd interview was with the Executive IT and another manager from a different department. 
 They were big on team work, working together, and being able to think critically within a team environment. I then realized that I painted a picture that I do most of my work alone (which is mostly true) but I highlighted times in my past & current roles that I worked in a team setting so they understood that I can do the work but more than happy and ready to work with like-minded ppl and have that transfer of knowledge that I was not getting in my current role. I got that squared away and closed the interview feeling that I was able to convey "hey I can do the job and I miss working within a team environment with like-minded ppl and I am ready to learn and put in the work"
 I received my offer later that evening. They wanted to make sure I would fit well within the 9 person team and be willing to learn. 
 Thanks everyone who mentioned softskills are important. I am now a Network Administrator!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, 
 I handle all of the IT infrastructure (End User Support, Sys Admin, Net Adm, etc.) and the current networking environment is running very old and EoL HP switches. I currently have a Fortigate 81f with HA installed with FortiManager. Along with that, we use FortiEMS and Forticlient for VPN, Anti-Virus, etc. I am considering the Fortiswitches. There is no inter VLAN happening, nothing layer 3, no PoE, just basic layer 2 routing. Keep in mind, this is for a small business, no larger than 60 employees. Would it be wise to switch to all Fortiswitches since I already have a Fortigate and Fortimanager? I had a demo and it was a huge difference compared to the current HP switches. 
 ​
 Has anyone used Fortiswtiches in a small business environment: no more than 10 switches. Are they reliable, dependable, or should I just stick with the big brands such as Cisco and Aruba? 
 Thanks for your feedback!

 We use O365 and I'm constantly struggling to keep up with the new features M$ decides we want. If something particularly useless or potentially confusing to users shows up I'll usually track down the GPO to disable it.
 Today a user came into my office to report a problem with her email reactions. I didn't know what she was talking about. She proceeded to show me that a couple weeks ago a new emoji button showed up alongside her Forward and Reply buttons in Outlook. I told her I'd look into it but that it sounds like a pointless new feature some people might have a little bit of fun with when it eventually rolls out to the rest of the company. 
 I could tell this response had more of an impact than the brush-off response I intended it to be - she then explained she had stopped sending replies to the majority of the emails she received from her team, opting to instead hit the 'Thumbs Up' emoji to indicate that their messages were seen and approved. I can only assume people thought they were being ignored. For weeks. 
 I also haven't been able to enable this feature on my own Client. I have Preview Mode on and am on the most up to date build.

 Currently, all of their data is in Dropbox. They are wanting to move from Dropbox to their new on-prem server because their Dropbox business account is getting pricey as they grow. Does Dropbox have any special migration tool like Sharepoint does or do I simply just download all of their data onto the server from Dropbox?
 I just did a few google searches and every article talks about moving from on-prem TO Dropbox.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clarification: I know that pseudowire is a specific thing: a transparent, multipoint and redundant backhaul that encapsulates other protocols to allow them to operate as if they were on a native P2P network.
 In my long history, pseudowire has essentially been two things: MPLS MetroE/MAN/WAN to facilitate public IP circuit sales to end customers or intranet aggregation between multiple regional offices allowing communication between physical locations without logically going out to the public internet. 
 I've been reflexively using "pseudowire" when referring to SD-WAN type devices that do something similar with a standard public facing interface for public internet and a virtual/tunnel interface for intraoffice aggregation.
 When using this terminology with folks my age, they either understand what I mean or don't speak up to say they don't/ask for clarification/etc. However, recently had a conversation with some in their early 20's who had no idea of what I was talking about. 
 Wondering if pseudowire is just a "Oldman referring to Rust as BASIC" or if the advent of SD-WAN as a VPN appliance has deprecated the usage of that term.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll try keep this brief. My goal is to eventually become an SWE, and I've spent the last ~2 years self-teaching via Udemy courses, Harvard CS50, and other similar resources, learning Python, some JS, a very small amount of SQL.
 All of my professional work experience to date is in the automotive/customer service industry. The last several years I've been an automotive Service Advisor at a dealership in a wealthy area. I'm no stranger to difficult/entitled people and how to deal with them. I see this as one of my skill sets that may set me apart from others trying to enter the field. So with this in mind, I've shifted gears over the last several months a bit more toward the SysAdmin side to earn my A+ certification, and just this week I earned my Network+ and CIOS badges.
 My reasons for this are:
  
Develop some more foundational knowledge of how hardware/software/networking work because having a greater understanding of that can obviously be helpful.
 Have something concrete to put on my resume other than "I've been watching a lot of videos and practicing".
 As stated above, entering IT on the SysAdmin side may be a clearer path to getting into IT for me, given my background.
  
MAIN TLDR QUESTIONS;
  
Is it common for people hoping to become developers to enter via help desk or similar role, then transition to SWE? Or is it generally better to pick one patch and go all in?
 Should I go for my Security+ and get the "trifecta" before throwing applications out? This leads me to the next bullet point
 I'm supporting a family of 5, and my wife does not currently work because our children are still young and not all in school yet. I need to make $80k+ to be able to afford our monthly expenses. Is it feasible for someone without a degree to enter the field making that kind of money? I'm in central Maryland, so the median salary is certainly above average for the US.
  
Any and all advice appreciated. TIA

 For example: I have a number in mind, it can be any number (lets assume 4513)
 For validation:
 I have to first press a certain key (it can be any key doesn't matter) 4 times
 then another key (again doesn't matter what key it is , it just have to be different from the first key pressed) 5 time
 then another key (again any other key but different then the other two) 1 time
 and again another key (again any key but different than previous used keys) 3 times
 This might be a very stupid idea and unsecured (i don't really have any experience in this field) but I am very curious if something like this exists out there or not.

 https://imgur.com/a/eYDQnoi
 The HP appears to have the wrong driver listed next to its name (blue underline) - It's matching the Brother driver (red underline). Even if I remove the printer and readd it with a different version driver it still shows the 10.0.17xxx version which belongs to the Brother printer.
 I've searched forums etc but nothing appears to solve this issue. I have even extracted the working driver from my machine (I added it manually to test the correct driver) and 'replaced' it on the PRTServer. 
 Has anyone seen this before and if so, how did you resolve it?!

 The only relevant domain GPO that might be affecting it is 'Prevent Uninstall from Start' but I set that to disabled in local GPO and no change.

 I have always had the assumption that the younger crowd was better with newer tech, but may struggle with older systems. My generation (GenX) grew up building their own PCs and doing a ton of stuff "from scratch" like creating boot disks and having to actually install a TCP/IP stack. 
 Now though you can grab an iPhone or iPad and they just work for 90% of the things you want like email, web and messaging. If you're heavy into social media you may not even use a browser much as things like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. all have apps.
 I supposed you could blame the fact that since these newer things work so well that skills like troubleshooting and figuring things out by building them have withered. 
 Anyone have any anecdotal takes on this?

 Recently I've been tasked with enrolling bitlocker in our environment. As we don't have AAD and introducing MBAM did not seem to be worth the effort for our small scale environment, we decided to create just the policy and then activate encryption manually via script per workstation. It suits our needs as we slowly switching from old computer vendor hodgepodge to standardized modern enterprise Dell workstations. The policy was thoroughly tested and I've determined it works and is safe to use company wide, then GPO was applied "wide" on almost all workstation containers. I was 100% sure nothing will happen because everywhere i looked GPO managed bitlocker need a manual trigger of some sorts to encrypt the drive by design. Just one day after policy rollout we noticed some of our new Latitude 3420 we gave to the users earlier in the week have bitlocker encryption active. Good thing recovery keys are present in AD but loosing the control of the process is major concern. It's especially weird as it happen only to the latitude laptops. The optiplexes 3000 are behaving as expected. I've read about Dell OOBE bitlocker encryption but it shouldn't effect us as we reimage all computers straight out of the box using WDS. Investigation of windows events gave me nothing to hold on to. It seems like one time event per host because once decrypted it wont happen again. My hypothesis is that WSD <WillWipeDisk>true< is not clearing bitlocker partition containing some sort of residual Dell ransomware but it does not seem likely. 
 What are your thoughts?

 And before someone answers: don't punch holes in your company's security - there's another company working on the same environment with much fewer security restrictions and I'm constantly getting complaints why are they doing things so much faster (idk Karen, maybe because they don't need 15 minutes to manually transfer artefacts through 3 jumphosts and can use rsync and other sane tools).

 However, in order to develop and create this, I first need to understand why many admins have a real fear of certificates. Is it because certificates have a defined expiration date, which cannot be jerked even in the event of a major disruption?
 Maybe you have some more ideas or can report from your daily admin life.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Lets see we have two hosts, same VLAN. Host A initiates a ping to host B. Host A sends its ARP request, and host B answers. At that point, does host B also do its own ARP request before sending its ICMP reply? Or does it populate its ARP table based on the original ARP request from host A?
 I feel this is a simple question but im struggling to find a definitive answer.
 Thanks

 I've been in IT for 12 years, currently IT Manager/infrastructure engineer for a small business. The usual stuff from virtual servers, azure, AD, firewalls, iso27001 compliance, networking as well as a small amount of IT support.
 I've had a job offer with a considerable pay and perks bump (albeit current company have offered to match pay) to move into an auditor role, auditing a much bigger companies systems as part of a team. All around ISO27001. 
 Has anyone made the move? I'm aware it can be dry, but it seems less like people are going to be screaming at you when things go wrong which might be nice! I'd be interested to hear people's thoughts as I'm very much on the fence. 
 Thanks,

If the drives are in RAID 1 or higher and you have email alerts about drive failures and 3/2/1 backups, it seems like it would be a perfectly viable server storage solution for small and medium sized businesses, along with super high performance.
 If you buy on a sale, you can get an m2 2TB or 4TB for $100 and $250 respectively, whereas Dell charges over $1000 per 2TB SATA SSD.
 Has anyone here had a good experience installing MS Server to an array on an m2 raid card? If so, can you recommend any specific cards?

 We have a user with 3 PC’s, we use MS Authenticator for MFA/SSO.
 The feedback I’m hearing is that on one PC the user will check to not ask again for 30 days… then they’ll be in another location on PC 2 and attempt to access an app behind SSO and get promoted for MFA, they’ll say don’t ask again for 30 days…. Then further on PC 3… same thing.
 To confirm, this is the behavior we would expect, right?! The “don’t ask again for 30 days” is specific to the device that they made that action on… 
 Does anyone know a way to “sync” multiple devices to respect the MFA prompt? 
 I appreciate the feedback.

 I left Zyxel off the list, as i can't stand their interface and methodology, after configuring a dozen of those things I would like to not have to touch one ever again.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[20 years in this game. Basically, all I've ever done. Got paid to defrag shit in the late 90s. Got paid to remove 11 IE toolbars in the early 2000s. Got paid to actually work as helpdesk in the late 2000s, into MSP world shortly after, and have essentially bounced back and forth between Fortune 500 and MSP. I'm in the trenches. I've called the vendors. Fought the contractors. Managed the managers. Blah... blah.
 ​
 I'll probably get "Fuck AT&T" etched on my headstone. I struggle to think of two words I've put together more frequently. 
 Consumer wireless/internet/TV? Check. Fuck 'em. 
 Business DSL/UVerse/IPFlex/BVoIP? Check. Fuck 'em.
 It's not even necessarily the service. Or the price. Although both of those .... well, aren't the best.
 It's the support. I can't think of a more frustrating thing to do than to call AT&T because something is wrong. TODAY? 6 hours. Not done yet, either, but done for the day. I can't count the departments, personnel, time zones, cultures, and frustrations that I encountered along the way. The first call is never the right call, nor the second, rarely the third, and your chances of success only creep upwards from there.
 Man... Fuck AT&T.
 ​
 ​
 PS - if anybody got those good resources, whatever department, if you know a good number to get a specific thing done... maybe this rant turns into a saving grace. Maybe it's just another rant on the internet. Yes, it's short, far as rants go. I'm tired. I called AT&T today.

However, recently quiet a lot of companies have taken interest in my resume and are reaching out. An issue I am conflicted about is, would it a bit awkward during an interview with a hiring manager to ask about if they see the role staying around? I know the economy is up in the air right now and I hear about layoffs, but not sure if that is a turn off for employers if you ask something about that. Since usually the first to enter are also the first to go when it comes to layoffs. 
 Just as a potential employee I would not want to get hired and then when the new year arrives get laid off.

Especially with how hard MS are pushing to kill IE once and for all and have everyone move onto Edge, to have no support for Edge for 9 months while the OS is supported seems really bizarre.
 If this is a Chromium thing that's out of MS's hands, I'd have thought they'd have enough clout to delay any underlying changes so they're not leaving this OS exposed like this?
 And yes, of course getting off 2012 R2 is the best option but not really the point of this.

 A strange thing happened and I'm currently working with PA support to troubleshoot this: a VPN tunnel establishes when the Peer IP (set as static) doesn't match but the local and peer identifier matches. The PSK matches. 
 Is this a normal occurrence or a bug in PAN OS?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy all. Not sure if this is the right place to post this. I've been working as a senior helpdesk manager for 2 years now at an MSP. These past 6 months have been absolute torture. Our company fired 2 of our 4 techs in span of two months. Our client base has only gotten larger. Raises haven't been handed out. Me and my single other coworkers workload has gotten enormous to the point where we can barely function. We have both expressed our concerns to the owners but they seem to fall on deaf ears. I guess my question is, does it ever get better? The Stress? The anger and frustration? Anyone have any suggestions on how they dcompress? This job has all but ruined technology for me. The main reason I originally went into IT was because I just love the satisfaction of fixing something that is broken, especially in tech. But that passion is gone. I know I haven't been in the game that long so I don't want to write off the industry as a whole, but I'm genuinely gonna lose it. 
 Sorry for the rant everyone!

 Some Background:
 Around 6 months ago, I went from being a Level II Service Desk Analyst to an IT Manager for a small business aerospace company (less than 50 employees). Won't lie to you, no clue how I got the job, guess they liked my soft skills. Applied cause the company name was cool, I'm deep in it now and I'm ready to gain some crazy experience.
 This was a brand new position as they are trying to move away from MSP IT to Internal IT. As of right now, I am the IT Department.
 The first few months I was understanding the layout of their network and understanding their immediate needs. I've finally gotten their top priority needs out of the way and now I can work on the nitty gritty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I have an issue that has been a complete PITA to troubleshoot and resolve.
 Infrastructure backstory:
 Core device is a fiber aggregation switch stack (2x Cisco C3850-12XS) that all MDF and IDFs connect to over LACP port channels (Fiber Sw 1 <> M/IDF Sw 1, Fiber Sw 2 <> M/IDF Sw 2).
 Wireless is handled by cloud management, no on-prem controller.
 Issue:
 Generally excessive amount of %SW_MATM-4-MACFLAP_NOTIF logs popping up in the fiber switch. Switch 2 interface for Port-Channel 5 and 6 have repeated state changes and appears to be related. The state change doesn't happen at the same time and is not consistent but does happen almost daily. Also, only the fiber switch side's interface is having this state change.
 Troubleshooting:
 Both fiber switches have been rebooted.
 Swapped the SFP modules from Sw 1 to Sw 2 and vice versa. State change issue remained on Sw 2.
 Only thing I haven't done yet was to move the SFP modules to completely new ports as this is remote site and I'm waiting on an onsite visit to get that accomplished.
 I am aware of the "why" this is happening, insofar as the MAC flaps caused by the end users roaming between APs that are on different switches, so it sees the MAC twice. What I'm perplexed on is why it's causing a couple interfaces to constantly drop. The drop is not causing noticeable issues and doesn't bring down the port-channel, just constantly state changing.

 Yes, I know they are EoL. Yes, I know the ports are oversubscribed. I'm fine even with the 6 Gbps per slot bandwidth of classic modules. Yes, I know they are power hogs.
 That being said, if I load a switch up with 384 SFP ports, it looks like it will only use about 1 KW of power. That isn't totally unreasonable. It's less than 3 W per port.
 Feel free to check my math:
  
redundant supervisors and chassis 554 W
 
8 x WS-X4448-GB-SFP @ 65 W each totalling 520 W
 
 Grand total 1074 W / 384 ports = 2,8 W per port
 So, what do y'all say? Yay or nay?

 The URL to their website is in the body.
  
The problem is even when you look at the Office 365 data it shows that DMARC and SPF passed AND that the URL in the body was not a threat.
 I have literally no data telling me why it was quarantined. We opened a ticket with Microsoft and it basically went nowhere. They wanted us to add it to the allow list in the account we were using for testing and they couldn't comprehend the bigger picture that this is a problem for anyone on Office 365 that they send to.
 What can we do in this situation? Microsoft's own portal says the URL is not a threat, we even checked the sending IP's, the smart host IP's and the website for blacklists (there were none). Has anyone been in this situation?

 When connected with anything in the middle (router, dumb switch with only those 2 devices) there's nothing. No settings changed etc.

I have contacted a few users of various technical proficiency to test out the instructions I have written up for them (a lot of older, computer-illiterate folks) and one thing I didn't anticipate (although I should have) is that quite a few folks were hesitant to download the MS Authenticator app, with some even outright refusing. Not everyone has a smart phone issued to them so we are still offering the option to authenticate with SMS. It's not ideal, but better than nothing. 
 Other than reiterating that the app does not collect personal information and does not open your personal device up for FOIA requests, is there anything I can tell people to give them peace of mind when we start migrating entire departments to MFA? I have spoken with department heads and our city manager about the potential for unrest over this, but is it just a case of telling people to suck it up and do it or you won't have access to your account? I want to be as accommodating as possible (within reason) but I don't want to stir the pot and have people think we are putting spyware on their personal phones.
 Anyone dealt with folks like this before?

 im wondering if on juniper this is the best method for bandwidth across the two suites.. we are getting terrible connectivity issues in the new suite with about 300 clients. 10gig fiber is ran from suite to suite.

From looking at the logs, I can see the login attempt from a remote location and a Authenticator MFA notification was approved. The user tells me that they didn't receive or approve any notifications. I tend to believe them since we have the numbers matching and location based settings turned on for Authenticator and I would think they would remember typing in the numbers.
 The strange thing I noticed is that the audit logs show a change in authentication methods at the time of the login. An iPhone was mysteriously added as an authentication method on the account.
 Has anyone seen behavior like this before?
 Update: After reviewing logs it looks like credentials were phished then an MFA approval by the user. I don’t think their lying, they just didn’t even realize they were phished. This created a mess because the attacker sent out 100’s of emails from the account. Thanks for all the info and suggestions that have been mentioned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I get "hold" messages for any spam or junk entering our mail system for our 150+ employees and can either release it, reject it, or take some other action. Normal email gateway stuff. 
 Unsolicited b2b spam (the "I'm circling back at the risk of being a lingering annoyance" messages) really, really frustrate me for a number of reasons, chief among them though:
  
dozens to hundreds a day; and,
 it pisses off employees if/when certain ones make it through routinely (think specific senders or domains) and then I have to hear about it.
  
My solution... every one of these messages I see entering our mail system, I add the sending domain (not the senders address) to an auto-reject list. If they have multiple domains associated with them that I can find, I block those, too.
 The other day I have this b2b rep contact me because they've discovered my game (+1 for your tenacity in actually figuring out what I'm actually doing, but I'm not unblocking your domain), and I get this ugly email about how I'm being unfair, depriving them of income opportunities, yadda, yadda, yadda. 
 So here's the question ... am I actually being unfair? How in the world is anybody supposed to combat the sheer, unrelenting torrent of daily b2b spam? 
 If anybody else has a better or less predictable way of "terminating" these emails, I'm all ears.

 I use many services that realize authentication via LDAP, in the course of the thought to eventually aim for LDAPS authentication I was wondering if authentication against the Active Directory for accessing a Windows machine that is a member of the domain is encrypted out of the box or does it need to have a PKI server too?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 ​
 I'm getting the two windows errors 10048 and 10055 on Windows 10 after a short while of runtime indicating that the listening address is already in use or no more sockets are available.
 ​
 I tried the following solution found on the Net: Increasing MaxUserPort under: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
 But that doesn't help.
 ​
 Also listing the opened Ports via netstat -a -b or tcpview.exe and trying to kill suspicious processes does not help. I have killed dozens of processes, but nothing helps and I failed to identify a bad process.
 Also there are not too many open listening sockets less than 50 maybe, so there is no way that the number of allowed sockets is maxed out. But still the system won't allow me to listen to any new socket, or any random port claiming that the address or socket is already in use or no buffer space is available to open any new connections.
 ​
 Only thing that helps is to restart the system and wait for the problem to occur again, which can happen within an hour or maybe work several hours for the error to occur.
 ​
 I'm out of ideas. The system was running fine for months and now this problem is bugging me since a few weeks without finding a solution that avoids a restart.
 Anyone has experience with these errors and has any suggestions beyond what I have already tried and mentioned above?
 The system is an I7 11th gen with 64GB of RAM running updated Windows 10.
 Thanks for the Help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a rule 6 / educational post (request).
 I live in Israel.
 Despite the country's reputation as being relatively advanced in technology, fiber optic has only begun getting rolled out here - on a largescale basis - over the past few years. 
 An awful lot of the rest of the network is still connected through vDSL and coaxial.
 I've been trying to make sense of how the various ISPs / infrastructure owners have been laying fiber in my city. 
 It took the best part of two years to finally become available at my building. And when it finally did, it seemed as if every fiber network (there are, I believe, at least 3) was hooked up.
 I know that the internet backbone is built on fiber and that the other inferior forms of connectivity are really used only for last mile stuff to bring internet to consumers.
 I guess what I'm curious to know is what kind of factors make it difficult and time consuming to go from getting fiber from a junction box to the point of being able to finally connect a building and then dwelling units.
 Liaising with other infrastructure providers? Waiting for permits from municipalities to dig up roads to lay cable? Lots of difficult splicing work that has to be carried out in the field?
 How does it happen, exactly, and why does it seem to be a long and cumbersome process?

My boss who has rights in AD, created a user locally, who actually previously worked for our district. so what I’m thinking happened is his local AD account was deleted originally after he left, but his O365 account remained. 
 When he created the local AD account, it created a new user and never synced with the original account? The root of the issue is we use the Company Name field for a dynamic group in Azure for email. 
 However, this users company name is different in AD then it is in Azure (from his previous role). His email and everything loads with no issues with his previous inbox. I thought of using power show and the Set-AzureADUserExtension cmdlet, but it won’t allow me because it’s originated on an on-prem AD.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OpenVPN is single threaded. Running multiple OpenVPN processes and assigning a public IP address to each one of them is a waste.
 I come from BSD world where solution to the problem is rather simple. Socket flag SO_REUSEPORT_LB allows multiple OpenVPN processes to connect to a single socket that performs UDP load balancing.
 Linux only comes with SO_REUSEPORT (without LB part). I had tried to think of a way to run multiple OpenVPN processes and came up with this
  
UDP proxy on a host (ha-proxy/nginx)
 OpenVPN processes in a container behind UDP proxy
 Each container peers with the host and announces its tun* interface (BGP, OSPF whatever. Or even a bunch of static routes on the host)
  
Looks like a lot of overhead. So how do you Linux guys scale OpenVPN?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey sysadmins, 
 I have been tasked with the great opportunity to destroy the data on 720 HDDs. I know. It's really cool ...
 I need to figure out a way to do it fast and secure. 
 In the past I have been using DBAN, but I need to figure out a solution to do batches of 10 or even more HDDs at once. 
 Any ideas what hardware is needed to achieve something like that? 
 The HDDs need to be reused, so it's just destroying the data on the drives that's needed and not the drive itself. 
 ​
 Any suggestions or experience with such a task is welcome.
 ​
 Thank you!

 * Easy to deploy and manage * Unattended, low maintenance * 100% cloud based * Cover already installed software, not only new deployments * Focus on low priority apps, like 7zip or web browsers. Business critical software is managed via Intune, will stay this way.
 PDQ Deploy and alike won't really work due to cloud requirement. I also don't want to rely on Intune for every app, updating it manually. I don't have the manpower at the moment. This is a one man department with MSP support. I need this to be smart and automated, while keeping it inhouse within my control. Something I can setup and let it do the work, like with Lenovo Commercial Vantage for firmware and driver updates on our fleet of devices.
 I'm looking into winget right now, specifically this spin on it: Winget AutoUpdate - WAU and I really like it so far, testing in the lab. Of course I know it won't cover 100% of my inventory, but it works really well for what it is. About to launch small pilot with 10 users.
 I'd love to hear about your experiences, some success stories (if any!). Have you tried similar approaches, be it Winget or Chocolatey? Do you maintain your own repos, deploy software this way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have successfully implemented (for the most part it seems) SPF, DKIM and DMARC to help with the spoofing of our domain but it seems that we are still receiving some spoofed mail despite the DMARC policy being set to quarantine.
 I had a look at the mail headers and believe this is due to our mail going out to a signature server, applying a signature and returning before being sent to its intended destination. This is set up in O365 via connectors and has an appropriate SPF record in our DNS.
 Could this be giving a false positive and passing on DMARC? In the header details, Authentication-Results comes back as a spf=pass, dkim=none, dmarc=pass but this is with the IP of our signature server so that is good because we want that to pass. Whereas Authentication-Results-Original returns a failure: spf=fail, dkim=none, dmarc=fail.
 Has anyone experienced this before and do you have any advice in how to combat this? Given that Authentication-Results-Original gives the result I would expect is the signature server causing this issue?

 I was wondering what other people's experiences were with the current Anti Virus solutions? if it was just up to us(at the IT) we would just depend on the tools we have now in defender and such, but thats not going to be good enough with 90 to 100 teachers walking around.
 ​
 some small tidbits of info
 - we currently have about 180 endpoint clients running
 - we are only paying 8 $ per user per year with Kaspersky, which is dirt cheap.
 - we are currently using a google workspace environment but we are planning on migrating to a microsoft azure environment
 - we are located in Europe. I dont think that matters much but I have read some different experiences between certain solutions between regions.

 I'm still new with all the SAML/SSO stuff.
 We have an app that connects to an IdP. The IdP requires the SP Metadata to have an entity ID in URI. Everything works well with this setup. I can see in the AuthnRequest that the Issuer is in URI.
 Now, we've been trying to put AWS Cognito or Auth0 between the web app and the IdP.
 The problem is, the IdP that we're using requires the Entity ID to be URI.
 In AWS Cognito/Auth0, Entity ID is in URN format. 
 I wonder if Cognito/Auth0 is not supported by the IdP. Also, what's the difference between IdP's that require URI and URN for the Entity ID?
 Thank you!

We also use Dell Latitude laptops. Initially everything was working great except the cracks began to show quickly. 
 Because the second monitor is daisy chained Windows doesn’t know about it immediately when returning from sleep or hibernate. This means that any windows that were open before sleeping will all move back to the primary monitor. 
 Intermittently when docking, one of the monitors will be blurry. Changing resolution to anything else then changing back to 1080p fixes it. 
 Worst of all, randomly when returning from sleep and logging in, the whole laptop will reboot. We’ve been unable to figure this out and Dell are stumped too. 
 All up this has been a major reputation hit and we’re now having to go back to buying docks and having to mess around with re-cabling all these desks. On paper they were perfect but in practice not so much.

I’m curious as to what proxies are in use as I have a few businesses that need the decryption but are thinking that it might be more cost effective to go with a proxy as opposed to using a NGFW - currently running ASAs but looking to make the leap.
 I remember Bluecoat back in the day but don’t think they are as popular as they once were.

 I work at a small MSP and my boss wants me to put something in place to stop ex-employees accessing company resources. For example our Mailchimp account, [support@company.com](mailto:support@company.com) with a randomly-generated password. An employee leaves and we want to make sure they can't get into this account. Simple enough, change the password.
 What do I do when there's Mailchimp, Unifi, Namecheap, VMware, Cisco, 300 of these accounts? Changing all of these passwords individually when an employee moves on is obviously an option but there has to be a smarter way. For a bigger company with thousands of employees this would be a full time job. How do the big players handle this?

 Say I have a three-router full mesh OSPF network and all of them are inter connected with 10Gbps links . On R1, I wanted to steer traffic towards to R2 and only failover to R3 by manipulating the OSPF cost. I could use the bandwidth command under the transit interfaces to make R1-R3 interfaces have lower bandwidth OR use the ip ospf cost command under the transit interfaces to make R1-R3 path cost higher. But which one would introduce the least production impact? I believe either would cause OSPF to re-calculate and flood the routing table, right?

At this point all those circuits are currently 1G but I’ve read that the Ciena does have two 10G SFP ports. Would they be able to provide a 10G SMF handoff with these current 3930 devices?

 I'm totally green when it comes to networking. I went to a site yesterday where they had changed ISP's from Comcast to Ziply Fiber. The Ziply folks installed the demarc box, ran a cable to a RAD ETX-2i-10G and then left without making any other connections. 
 The people at the site had no idea how any of it worked and had no idea where the Comcast cable was coming in their building. I'm pretty sure I traced it to where Comcast comes in the building and goes into a fiber patch panel. 
 Am I able to just unsplice? the Comcast cable out of the patch panel and splice the new Ziply wire in? Or will they have to get a new patch panel to keep their current setup?

 I'm using MetalLB on the k3s cluster for BGP, and FRR service installed on the pfsense router. BGP is working fine, and my BFD profiles are quickly detecting failures. 
 The problem is with ECMP, I was expecting equal load balancing of traffic across all three nodes (with pfsense distributing the traffic with FRR). However, it looks likes its only choosing one "best" route even though it says the other two are multipath...

 Am I understanding ECMP correctly, or maybe FRR doesn't support round-robin ECMP? But if it doesn't, what's the purpose of any ECMP support?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 tl;dr: How do you provide internet to multiple locations and have it tie into your main network?
 I want to preface by saying that I have very little networking experience. However, the facility I work for no longer has a network administrator so I'm trying to learn some more of how it's setup. 
 Currently, there is one main location, and several satellite locations. From what I understand, the network comes in to the main building, and at some point is literally beamed over to 4 other locations. This is accomplished via emitters and receivers by Ubiquiti. As I've just found out, when one of those receivers goes down, Ubiquiti offers no support to help troubleshoot, or replace if needed. And replacing one involves climbing a long ladder with another ladder to reach the point that the receiver is on, mounting the equipment to the roof at a specific angle, and pointing it at the emitter at a precise point to receive the internet connection. All things that sound really specialized. 
 In any case, previously I worked at a school district. There were 19 locations, and no Ubiquiti or something similar wireless emitters in sight. 
 My question is, is something like this usually done by getting separate Internet connections configured, one for each building, and tying them into the main network? One of the Ubiquiti receivers is several miles away (so I've been told), I'm actually shocked it works at all. It seems like a really odd way to take care of something that seems mostly self explanatory... but I don't really know what I'm talking about.

 To elaborate: For the past week now, maybe a little more, Google thinks my organization's IP range is in France, and not the US. After some testing we came to the conclusion that the problem is with Google.
  
Browsing to Google.com with any browser (we tried several), from within the company network: location shows as France
 Browsing to Google maps automatically opens France
 Location sharing in the browser is disabled company wide - browsers not sending location data
 Tried both Google and Bing; Bing has the right location
 We have our own ASN
 ARIN registration is current and correct
 Searched multiple publicly available geolocation DBs - all show the correct location for our IP range
  
Any advice would be appreciated!
 Or any clue on how to get a hold of the right people at Google. That seems nearly impossible!

 I am new to this sub and found about the Meraki Go lineup last week. I am wondering if I can just buy the Meraki Go APs and get all the benefits of VLAN setup, Mesh network without buying the switch and router? I already have an unmanaged switch to connect all the APs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My client just acquired a neighbor's warehouse space. The building is adjacent to my client's existing company. But new office employees will be sitting at the farthest point, maybe 150M (edited after measuring) meters from the existing office and server room. The new space has its networking room and wiring. The owner wants new employees to connect to the main server room.
 The existing office has 100 employees.
 The new space will have 60 employees. ( these users will be using our network share - lots of engineering drawings, etc. )
 How should I connect these two server rooms?
 I am no expert in long-distance cable networking.
 I appreciate it if you have any ideas/questions/concerns.
 Their existing subnet is 255.255.252.0
 What kind of switch and cables should I use? Cat6, Cat7, or Fiber?
 I am thinking of putting https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07YWJT5CZ/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&th=1 with unifi switch.

My reseller has recommended the Fortigate 200F to replace our Cisco routers AND our Cisco 5525X firewalls. The 200F with enterprise bundle is cheaper than just a Cisco 8300 router...this seems too good to be true. Anybody got insight on moving from Cisco to Fortinet? A little background on our location we run a vmware datacenter with roughly 150 servers, and a call center with up to 200 users.

 I have been in the technology field for about a decade so not really long I guess. I started in the help desk and I am now a sys admin. I do not do any hiring. In my experience, when I work with a new employee (in the IT dept) and I see them doing the ol chicken pecker method to type out an email, I just feel like I am going to be in for a long day. Maybe its the few people I have worked with. I've seen people at my last job hire someone with "years of experience" just to find out they cant use the home keys. Next thing you know I have to explain a process to them several times. training new people is exhaustive.
 I have been using a mouse / keyboard since I was a kid so I don't expect everyone to be a fast typer but I feel like there is a correlation between keyboard familiarity and knowing your shit.
 Have any of you seen someone break this stigma that I have in my head? are there people out there in senior management positions that actually know what they are talking about and are chicken peckers? or new employees you got in? 
 Edit: a lot of people are taking this personally. I am not saying that I have an HR problem with a slow typer. or I wouldnt give them a chance. I wanted to see if anyone else that has seen someone be bad with a mouse / keyboard but be good as a technician.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm not sure if anyone else can give me a hand. I've started implementing MFA/radius auth across all my switches.
 The 2920's and others it works fine.
 I get to the 5406 and it's not. I'm half wondering if the source ip isn't what I think it is. 
 As the 5406 is a core switch, I don't know where the traffic is coming from.. (I would think that it would come from the IP I manage it from) but the commands primary-vlan and others mentioned in older docs don't exist anymore. I'm running KB.16.03.0006 
 radius-server host x.x.x.x key "******"
 radius-server timeout 15
 radius-server retransmit 2
 aaa authentication login privilege-mode 
 aaa authentication ssh enable radius local
 aaa authentication web enable radius loca
 ​
 At the moment I'm using this, the 5406 has a dozen IP's it could use to do authentications, the radius server requires I specify the IP the radius auth requests are coming from.. (fortinet's fortiauthenticator)
 Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We (the server/sysadmin team) have been managing SCCM for about 5 years. We use it for reporting, Windows client updates (monthly), some application installs, and other various means. 
 Recently, our Systems Architect has decided the help desk needs to manage Windows updates for the clients, his reasoning? They are workstations, the server team is not responsible for them. Ok, from a high level perspective, I agree. However, the system used to manage those updates is our responsibility. 
 He is really pushing this on the help desk, so I've decided him and I need to have a meeting about this. 
 I find several issues with this line he is trying to draw:
 •The help desk does not currently manage nor know how to use SCCM (I understand this does not mean it isn't their responsibility)
 •The sysadmin team has been managing SCCM for 5 years (this doesn't mean it's our responsibility)
 •None of our roles define SCCM as a responsibility
 Typically, a Desktop Engineer role would buffer this, but we don't have that role.
 So who is responsible? Managing clients is a gray area, some responsibility falls on us, some on the help desk. This all started when I pulled the data on our ~800+ clients running 1909, critically out of date. He said the help desk should have known and been on top of it, and here we are. 
 I have found little to no help desk roles in the industry where SCCM is a requirement, quite the opposite for sysadmin roles. 
 I look forward to and appreciate all your input.
 Edit: Lots of good points about this being an opportunity for the HD folks to grow. The problem is, they don't want to grow, or learn SCCM, or apply for our open sysadmin role. 
 I hope this provides some clarification on that front.

 We use a scheduling software that allows to send emails from their system, and any email sent out, or replied to will all be stored in a communication log for the related event using a specific sort of gibberish email address generated for each of them. 
 We’ve recently had issues where clients are not receiving emails, or emails are being blocked by bounces. At first I thought maybe their email server was just having issues but I think I found something that might tell me why. After several requests they finally advised the bounce code was 550 - which to my understanding means the server blocked the message based on a spam filter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear community,
 I'm in the process of setting up an Azure VPN Gateway S2S connection (route-based IKEv2).
 For best throughput, Microsoft recommends to use GCMAES256 for both IPsec encryption and IPsec Integrity.
 Another supported option would be to use AES256 for IPsec encryption and SHA256 for IPsec integrity.
 I am wondering if there would be any security implications.
 Summarized, these are the configurations that I am considering for the IKEv2:
 configuration 1: GCMAES256:
  
 IKE Phase 1:   
  
 Encryption Integrity/PRF DH Group 
  AES256 SHA384 ECP384 (=DHGroup 20) 
  IKE Phase 2(IPsec):   
  IPsec Encryption IPsec Integrity PFS Group 
  GCMAES256 GCMAES256 ECP384 (=DHGroup 20) 
 
 ​
 configuration 2: AES256+SHA256:
  
 IKE Phase 1   
  
 Encryption Integrity/PRF DH Group 
  AES256 SHA384 ECP384 (=DHGroup 20) 
  IKE Phase 2(IPsec):   
  IPsec Encryption IPsec Integrity PFS Group 
  AES256 SHA256 ECP384 (=DHGroup 20) 
 
 ​
 Since throughput will be better using GCMAES256 for both IPsec encryption and IPsec Integrity, I want to use configuration 1.
 Would there be any reason to prefer configuration 2 over configuration 1 from a security point-of-view ?

But none of them have ever used any rules. When it effects one user in that office it effects all of them. Happens with both internal and external emails. New threads and replies. Different subfolders. Seems to be completely random, but does always seem to move it to the “correct” folder. I haven’t gotten these types of reports from any other office. 
 Has anyone else seen similar behavior? We’re running a hybrid environment with on-prem mailboxes and O365 client.

If so, would you say the older write ups still stand or has SAP changes enough in that time to justify digging through the processes and making new usage parameters to monitor with?

 I am fairly new to IT. I am about to finish a 4 year degree (IT) and I have been working the helpdesk / light network admin work for the past year. I also have a few certs, Net+ and AWS CCP. 
 So I can’t say that I haven’t learned anything- I have learned a LOT. But I feel like learning actual in-demand skills at a high level, as well as actually retaining that information, is difficult.
 Recently, I’ve started taking my learning more seriously. Instead of just reading a book or watching a video, I actually break them down and document what I am learning in Notion. But I feel like the things that I am learning aren’t sticking like they do for some of the other senior guys on forums like this.
 How do you guys go about learning and actually retaining the information you learn? I’ve even had the thought that what I am doing now is right, because I am learning how to learn, aka getting better at learning new technologies, which I think is a foundational skill in IT.
 TLDR; How do you learn and retain knowledge specific to IT?

 Has anyone had any experience with dealing with a mixed environment that are using both M$ Auth App for some users where others are either still using SMS or alternative methods and looking to roll out the Number Matching/Geo Notification functionality within Azure AD Portal?
 Just wondering if when flipping the Auth method policy on to "All Users" if it'll cause any headaches with the previously setup alternative methods for authentication (such as SMS/etc), or only with those that may be using the M$ Auth App will that impact.
 We have been piloting it here since preview with a few of our staff, it works great. Its just trying now to figure out how to turn this on and then begin full migration over to it from those that are using the less secure methods (SIM Swap/etc). 
 TIA!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys
 Tbh, not sure if this is a Windows or Networking question .. but here goes.
 TL;DR - Is it normal for a DHCP server to show ~150 Request/Ack entries for a given PC for a given day?
 .
 On my workplace I'm investigating some logs from a specific PC, where I need to crossreference the timestamps with the DHCP server's communication with said PC.
 The PC was on-prem on the day in question, talking directly with the company DHCP server (although there might have been a firewall in between the LAN networks).
 When I ask my colleague to pull the DHCP logs (from Logpoint) for one 24-hour period, I get somewhere close to 150 DHCP entries in the log, with a ca. 50/50 distribution of DHCPREQUEST and DHCPACK (status: RENEW).
 The initial DORA process on the PC's boot looks fine - it's all the entries after that which puzzle me. The PC retains the same IP address all day.
 Lease time is 4 hours, I'm told (can't confirm on my own PC, working from home right now).
 .
 My first thought is that the user closes the lid many times during the day, and the PC will negotiate a renew on the lease when it wakes again. However, my colleagues insist that the PC should retain its IP when going to sleep (not hibernate). My Google skills fall short when trying to confirm this.
 But even if the PC renegotiates every time - it would mean that the user closes their lid every 10 minutes or so during an entire day, and opens it immediately afterwards. This seems extremely unlikely.
 I've asked the DHCP guys at work about this, but they're out of office these days, so I'm trying here meanwhile.
 Does anyone have an input as to why the Logpoint logs show ~150 DHCP entries for a single PC during one work day (assuming normal user behaviour)?

 Other posts with comments where some say never to install it on a DC, some say its fine/doesnt matter as long as you configure it correctly. And documentation says install it on a mgmt computer and then the GPO extension says to typically where you edit GPOs which would be on a DC.
 I want to use LAPS only for clients. And setting the GPO to apply only on clients OU.
 Installing LAPS MGMT tool on a DC shouldnt be any problems right? As long as I dont set the LAPS settings GPO to apply for the DC.

 Often times the translations are jsut ridicolous, you better know if they like \ or / to seperate directories (there are generally no examples or guidance given near or above fields), you have to tick a box to enter a host-name instead of an ip adress (i guess a regex check was too hard for them to code), there is no search option despite the massive number of settings and submenus and it's just on the slow side, i could go on...
 Am I just stupid? How do you feel about Konica Minolta's web interface?

 This guy has now gone to another job somewhere in security in the same business and handed over BAU support to us. This environment is ancient, all running on EoL hardware, out of support operating systems, lights up like a Christmas tree on pen-test reports that we've been trying to address for six months now...although at this stage it would be easier to just turn the whole lot off, politically that's not really possible. 
 Out of all the business guess who is most up our arse about fixing the absolute fuck load of problems with this environment? Yep, the guy that has looked after it for twelve fucking years and addressed absolutely none of the problems.

 I can find guides on some other compliance partners but it doesnt say anything about Endpoint Central.

Aruba J9150D compatible SFP is $26 while Dell or Cisco is $20. The gap is even larger for single mode J9151D. I was once told there were extra parts in the HPE-Procurve /Aruba ones, but I’ve never heard why or what they actually do. Or if that is even true.

I'll be honest that part of it is on me: in the past year, I've lost a brother, been hospitalized twice, had my wife hospitalized, father with a quad-bypass, mother very recently with a stint replacement, and a minor family member we've had to coach through some life-altering nonsense that I'd rather not repeat. So, yeah, I've been a little out-of-pocket this year, and that's on me. 
 I got this guy not only his job, but his position, then he did an end-run around me with an outgoing C-level exec to get team lead, and due to a manpower shortage at the time, fell into management. I was honestly okay with all of that, because I knew the guy was A-list material; I wouldn't have gone to bat for him otherwise. Also, fuck management... in 25 years of this, I've never wanted to be one, so more power to those who do. 
 So, here I am... trying my best to be cordial with a guy who has from day one of having access to payroll been upset that I make more than him, while he's talking to me like the goddamned godfather, filling a position I had the opportunity to leave at least five times, now trying to get out-from-under before I get fired or PIP'd into a corner, all while trying not to be the asshole who fracks off without leaving documentation. 
 Sigh... I was honestly hoping to be able to retire at this one. Ten years with an employer is a pretty good stint, in my book.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the last week, there's been 4 major attacks affecting certain social agencies and NGO's, i've been curiosly following these stories and one culprit that keeps popping up is 'MFA Fatigue' , in an attempt to secure our infrastructure or reduce chances of falling prey to some of these attacks, i've been implementing a handful of measures/policies, most of which i actually learnt from here through various posts and responses.
 In the wake of this, i have a few questions or concerns that i'm hoping to get some feedback on how you all handle this in your organizations.
  
how do you deal with MFA fatigue? by preventing MFA from prompting via push notification but rather require the user open the App and fill in the code? this way if you aren't logging in anywhere, you won't have the need to open the app?
 how do you also handle Atypical travel? blocking IP or setting strict account lockout threshold?
 is SSPR adviceable? or does it grant an attacker an added option to gain full control?
  
I already did research most this via google and Microsoft learn...so as the attackers. i was just wondering if there are any other methods apart from the obvious of dealing with these attacks.
 ​
 thanks.

The tunnel connects our US and China offices. Trouble is, I've never been able to explain why. To get it back I usually have to failover to our backup ISP in the US office (and fail back to the primary again) and it will come back up.
 There are other occasions when the tunnel from China to our other offices (also in Asia) fails so the common theme is China. What's the likely reason? Could it just be the great FW in China having an impact? We use Check Point firewalls - happy to learn something new!

 I've been a bit of an idiot and i didnt realize that Windows 10 had version 22H2. I assumed that was Windows 11 and onwards. My site of around 300 machines are all running 21H2 so from my understanding i can upgrade via the enablement package. 21H2 have support until the middle of next year so no immediate rush.
 I want to push this out to a few machines to test, i use WSUS and client side targetting so applying this to individual machines can be a pain as i would have to setup a new GPO to target a new client side group.
 I was wondering if its possible to get hold of the files and push it out via PDQ instead? I notice it says they are not available from the Windows Update catalogue though.
 Has anyone else used the enablement package outside of WSUS some how and managed to upgrade machines?
 Appreciate any advice

 Quite a few months ago (Or maybe even last year), we had a case of Conficker on one of our client's DCs. Back then, I thought I completely removed the thing, since it was coming from an old XP machine, made it's way to the DC and didn't really do anything else, since it was so effing old. I used ZenMap, to, supposedly, find all remains and remove them, but now I've gotten a notice, that the disk-space for C:\ is getting low. I checked to find Sophos Endpoint Agent creating snapshot files by the hour, because it kept finding and deleting the same file in Sys32, that is being generated by some mysterious Conficker Virus remains. 
 I checked online, but didn't get any real results, just some general tips, on how to remove Conficker. Now, I'm not really experienced, when it comes to malware and viruses, so I don't know, where to start, that's why I'm turning to your expertise again. If you need more info, please go ahead and ask, and I'll provide any necessary info.
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I work for an employer with a number of different sites. The organization's main office is moving from one location with multiple one-story buildings to a seven-story office building over the next year or two. Until now, our scheme for data has mostly followed 10.111.X.Y, with X being an arbitrary VLAN ID associated with a specific department and Y being the host. VoIP has typically mirrored that but with a VLAN ID equal to X + 100 (i.e. VLAN 50's voice VLAN is 150), and wireless has been a single VLAN across the entire organization. 
 At our new building, we are tentatively planning on sticking with 10.111.X.Y, but with X being an arbitrary VLAN associated with the floor, not the department. The idea is to hopefully simplify management on our end since there will be multiple departments per floor but only one switch stack. We're planning on the same voice VLAN scheme. We're undecided on whether to do a single wireless subnet or one per floor. We're also considering adding another VLAN schema (like X + 200) for various maintenance devices on each floor of the new building, like cameras, HVAC equipment, etc.
 Does this all make sense? Is there a more efficient way of doing this? What's worked in your experience? We don't have too large a number of end users or devices, but we figure if there was ever a time to adjust our addressing it would be now. As a side note, what is standard practice for VPN pools? Right now we are using a completely random range (10.100.20.x). Would it make more sense to use something in the 10.111.x range? Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

 My previous position had me in DevOps engineering where I was able to master Kubernetes, Helm, CI/CD, and Infrastructure-as-code best practices. Unfortunately due to various reasons I reached that "burn-out" point where I was underpaid and overwhelmed with the work being requested of me, so I found a new position earlier this year, working in media.
 A few months in, the transition between the two environments has been, well.. extreme.
 Pros: Finally getting paid what I'm worth, in an industry more to my liking, with less responsibility!
 Cons: Mostly Windows environment (few hundred servers, mostly bare-metal), no documentation aside from a handful of spreadsheets, inconsistent communication within the department, no one's even heard of a code repository before, management is very resistant to change. 
 I'm someone who's done all the DevOps things and enjoys doing them when the workloads are reasonable. This is the path I want to grow in as (from what I can tell) the world is moving more towards microservice/IaaS models. 
 Am I in the right for wanting to gracefully push the place more towards modern standards? or should I just accept that this is the culture in the new industry and maybe this position isn't a good fit after all?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have 3 AD. One in cloud. Two on prem. Recently promoted the Cloud to become Primary holding all FSMO role.
 Initially all replication are doing well. 
 Recently start popping error of sysvol failed to replicate followed by AD changes not showing on PDC despite DFS, repadmin, dcdiag and dfsdiag not showing any error at all. 
 Currently clueless on what to do. 
 PDC is hosted on AWS. Built fron scratch on Server 2019.
 Member server are Server 2016 which u will call SDC1 & SDC2
 Additional info.
 Sync between SDC1 and SDC2 are doing fine.
 Tried performing repadmin /syncall /AdeP and replicate from option in ADSS on PDC but still not showing latest changes (new computer object and user creation)
 UPDATE 1: If i perform repadmin /syncall on PDC it goes straight to syncall finished without showing the usual replication is in progress information.
 Update 2: will temporary put it as solved. As i realize its Inter-Site and not Intra-Site hence the default replication timing is 3 hours. But will keep a look out if problem still shows will do a ADFS restore.

 Network Engineer for Municipal ISP. We currently have a /23 and /22 from ARIN. I'm planning for when we need more addresses. There are several options and I'd like to ask your opinion to see what your experiences have been.
 We could go down the road of CGNAT. Very expensive and we are a small shop with no experience with this technology.
 NAT6to4 seems easy enough to configure, but I worry about to scalability and robustness.
 We also have the option to lease additional /20 IP space for ~ 0.20c and IP per year with a 5 year term. Cheap, but not a long term solution.
 Then there is the option of getting IPv6 space form ARIN and using IPv6 exclusively. Without complete internet adoption of IPv6 I worry about routing and reachability issues to organizations that aren't at least dual stacked.
 What are your thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All this talk about how the November CU update was breaking domain authentication in environments where RC4 was explicitly disabled via group policy sent me down a rabbit hole.
 My environment wasn't affected, but it made me curious about WHY so many have disabled RC4. TLDR; it's less secure than AES256.
 Step 1) audit your domain controllers for RC4 in use. Just replace DC01 with the name of your domain controller. 0x17 events means RC4 is being used.
 Get-WinEvent -LogName 'Security' -ComputerName 'DC01' -FilterXPath "*[System[EventID=4769] and EventData[Data[@Name='TicketEncryptionType']='0x17']]" 
 What this uncovered is that Azure AD Connect for hybrid environments was using RC4 (it creates a computer object called AZUREADASSOACC). I guess the reason for this was that until sometime in 2020 AES wasn't supported?? So if you use Azure AD Connect, you might want to look into this to improve security.
 Anyway, this article nicely outlines the steps needed to get Azure AD Connect using AES https://azuregeek.io/en/secure-azure-ad-sso-and-disable-rc4-hmac/?q=%2Fen%2Fsecure-azure-ad-sso-and-disable-rc4-hmac%2F
 After following these steps & rolling over my Kerberos decryption keys I now see Azure AD SSO now using AES (0x12 in the event log)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just ran into WU failing to install some updates with 0x800f0922 error code.
 Googled it and these failures are fairly common, but the "solutions" are all over the place. The most common one is to disable secure boot in the BIOS. Another one from this thread is to enable AppReadiness service. Plus the regular assortment of "sfc /scannow" and "dism /restorehealth" voodoo, and all the way up to updating BIOS and what not.
 The PSA is this - all of this is nonsensical. 0x800f0922 is a generic error meaning "the installer failed".
 To understand the cause you need to skim though %WinDir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log and find the first error that then triggers a cascade of failures culminating in 0x800f0922.
 In our case it was that ... drumroll ... %System32%\Macromed\Flash directory was missing. Created it, re-run updates - et voila - all updates went through.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an HP L3 switch connected to a Cisco L3 switch and am in the process of migrating SVIs. They are connected via 2x10G links in an LACP port-channel. This trunk carries a number of VLANs. There are devices hanging off of the Cisco switch with the HP core still handling the routing, and that all works fine.
 I created a test VLAN on each switch and added it to the trunk on both ends, with the intention of testing the SVI on the Cisco switch and only L2 on the HP side. I don't know if it's coincidence that this is happening with the test VLAN, but I can't get the test VLAN to pass any traffic across the trunk. Devices connected to the Cisco switch can talk to the SVI, but anything on the other side of the trunk can't connect. I've done variations of testing and essentially, any devices on that test VLAN can talk to each other unless they are physically located on the other side of the trunk. I've moved the SVI to the HP side and anything on HP side is now able to talk to the SVI and anything on Cisco can no longer talk to it.
 If I run a packet capture on a device from either side, it sends ARPs and gets no replies, furthering my suspicion that this is just a L2 trunk issue.
 I suspect there is some sort of bug with this VLAN not getting passed because I added it later than other VLANs. I plan to shut and no shut the port on the Cisco switch during a window. I have encountered something similar when using VTP in the past.
 Just wondering if I'm missing something - this seems fairly basic so I'm astounded it's causing such an issue.
 EDIT: No VTP in use. The Cisco switch is a pair of stacked 9500s, and the trunk port is cross-chassis etherchannel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to design a network for a tether to a vehicle. The original plan was to have a tether cable with two single mode fiber cables and have the cables running in full-duplex which is something I have done before. The network is very simple as in the image.
 The problem now is that due to supply issues is that we can only source a tether with a single fiber single mode. I have not set up a network like this before. Is it possible to still set up the same design using half-duplex mode. I have the following questions:
  
What type of media converter do I need to look for? The one I was going to use was https://www.mpl.ch/t2875.html since it needs to be small to fit the vehicle. But I am guessing the 100Base-FX or 1000Base-X are not compatible with half-duplex.
 What type of transceiver/connector would be best to use since I can no longer just use the LC Duplex connector?
 Are there any special considerations for the router/switch that I need to use to support half-duplex the original plan was to use a tiny unmanaged switch. But not I am not so sure that is possible https://botblox.io/products/gigablox-small-gigabit-switch
  
Is my idea still possible or do I need to abandon it now?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've noticed while building out some ansible automation that some of the modules take a very long time to complete runs. The main issue here is that it is slowing down the control plane and affecting some SNMP alerting. The main culprit here is the "no shut" command or rather enabling/disabling ports. 
 I've tried using the ansible module only for enabling ports, as a shutdown command is visible in the configuration and does not run. Templates for the rest of the configurations.
 I've tried using a template to speed up runs, which does help a bit, but still requires applying no shutdown to all ports in a switch stack. This takes a significant amount of time.
 ​
 Has anyone run into this type of problem with automating switch configurations? Should I look at another feature within ansible or perhaps use a separate tool to manage port status (maybe pulling facts? Or using napalm? Direct API commands?) ? I haven't seen anything that will allow the no shutdown command to be present in the configuration, but it would be a nice to have feature.

 I personally needed this for recording a screencast of the process to install Corso. While recording myself going through permission settings in M365, I didn’t want to unintentionally reveal PII for my team members or other sensitive data.
 Another reason to do this is if you’re looking to level up both your skills and want to experiment with being the admin in your own space rather than impacting other users on a production domain. It’s also a good step to experiment with owning your own identity.

Essentially, barracuda has an internal list of senders and IPs it marks as -1000 and does not apply filtering to normally. This is obviously a problem, but if this list was EXTREMELY well curated, it would probably be fine. However, it is not. It whitelists all salesforce IPs for example, even if it's a newly set up gmail etc. There are a lot of ways to exploit this list that I've observed since reporting the issue and just two weeks ago we had something very malicious make it through. I am not going to list every single way in which this list is easily exploited, but if you dig into it on your side you will very quickly see how someone could easily take advantage of it just by knowing it's there …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm working with a company with several small branch offices. They have older Junipers that work as their gateway/firewall/edge router and VPN gateway. I'm trying to swap out these all-in-one appliances slowly, but it doesn't seem like any new VPNs want to connect to the older Junipers. Any advice? It's a hub-and-spoke setup.
 I'm thinking that the best way to proceed is to start in their central office by connecting a new appliance to the old, passing it a single public IP (1to1) at first, then slowly moving over other IPs, the branch VPNs, and services as time and budget permits. Eventually, the new appliance would be doing all the work. At that point, remove the old appliance and plug the new one directly into the ISP's modem. 
 Is there a more common way to work through this scenario? Are there any gotchas? The project is not a rush and I assume it'll take a couple of months to complete. If we were just talking about a few offices, I'd get everything provisioned, take them down on a Friday evening, and be done by the following Monday, but there are just too many branches to coordinate that over a single weekend. Thoughts?

 I’ve spoken to Draytek, they have confirmed to me that they don’t support and are not looking to support 464. We are currently using some TP-link mesh boxes for lab testing though they don’t support 464 either though they are being cagey with me in regards to their roadmap. 
 Budgets are a bit above my pay grade, this is just POC work at the moment. 
 I know that OpenWRT supports it. But that brings a host of issues that I’d rather not have to deal with in a prod environment.

 My question though is about Cisco Anyconnect. Usually we add the url that the VPN connects to but yesterday I ran into an issue. The person who was trying to connect, their any connect box on their screen just had a name of the server they were connecting to, not an IP or url.
 What would be the best way then to find the IP or URL in this case? When we went to the any connect settings , they were all blank because he was not connected.
 Our way of getting it to work was his wife, who was working remotely and also on the same VPN, sent a screen shot of her settings and from there we were able to get the server IP.
 But I am just curious what would have been the best way to find the IP or URL? Is there a file I can look at on the users PC? Like I said, when we went to his any connect settings, they were all blank beacuse he was not connected.
 Thanks

It should be pretty predictable, especially when ASICs are involved. When it comes to firewalls the answer seems obvious - it probably depends on what the firewall is configured to do (and it may do a lot).

 For many months we have been trying like everyone else to strengthen the security of our infrastructure and one of the many, many points to improve is to no longer use the domain administrator (the default one).
 The necessary was done but I noticed that it was still used. After reading the events I found the origin of the problem: a SQL server. Every evening when performing the backup jobs, the following logs appear :
 https://i.postimg.cc/bNnmqtHH/sql.jpg
 I've checked everywhere (in jobs, in SQL Server service accounts) and I don't see our domain admin populated.
 Any idea how to prevent it from being used ? I wonder if SQL Server was installed with this domain admin and if the problem can come from there.
 Thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 So, long story short, we had an ask from our company to take our external contractor AD Users and run Enable-RemoteMailbox on them. We quickly found out that was not what should have been done and they should have had the command, Enable-MailUser run on them as they are external contractors and we simply want to have them as AD Users that have an external email address that mail is resolved to.
 Okay, simple enough I thought. So, I went ahead and ran the following for each user that was affected:
 Disable-RemoteMailbox -Identity <users> -Confirm:$false
 Enable-MailUser -Identity <user> -ExternalEmailAddress <[user@theircompany.com](mailto:user@theircompany.com)>
 We also wanted their Email field in the General tab of AD to match their UPN, so after running the above commands, AND before AAD sync happened (unfortunately) we updated their Email field to match that of their UPN. When we run the Enable-MailUser is makes their Email property their external email address. Well, that appears to have messed up those users where now On-prem they are showing as MailUsers, but in 365 they are showing still as a UserMailbox for RecipientType.
 We are struggling to get this update on both ends. So far, I have tried taking one of the users and running Disable-MailUser, letting that sync over to 365 and then running Enable-MailUser again. No luck. I have tried having the user set up as a MailUser On-prem and then stop syncing them with 365. Once they are no longer synced, I then re-sync them, but again, no luck.
 What's even stranger is we noticed that when we disable them On-prem as a MailUser, and then re-sync them, one property keeps getting written back it would seem from 365 to On-prem...
 Within the user's proxyAddresses, one address shows up. The x500? I'm wondering if I am missing a step here or if something else needs to be updated for these users to finally sync up as a MailUser On-prem as well as in 365? Thanks everyone!

PC's are a mix of Windows 10/11, all installed with Office 365. Whenever we have a new user logon, the system tries to load Outlook 2016 and connect to our old Exchange server (FYI, this is no longer turned on) My question is how does Windows try and load the 2016 version of something that isn't installed and what setting do I need to turn off to stop it trying to connect to old Exchange?
 All our DNS records are correct and pointing to 365. In the interim of swapping systems we had to have an Autodiscover GPO which is now deleted.
 Any help appreciated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I've inherited an AD with company.com as internal AD domain as well es external domain name. Right now the external records (e.g. www.company.com) are just placed inside the default "company.com" zone inside the AD DNS.
 Is there currently any Best Practise way to keep external records automatically up2date inside the AD zone?
 There might be some way to automate this with powershell (lookup external records and set internal records accordingly) but this feels a bit too hacky.
 Best case would be to tell AD to lookup the records on the external DNS if the internal DNS does not have any records. As far as I understand by default AD doesn't forward those requests since only the internal DNS is authoritative for "company.com"?
 It's probably not as simple as adding the external name server to "Properties -> Nameserver" on the AD I guess?
 Is there any way around this problem or do you just have to live with manually maintaining those external records on the internal DNS?
 I've also seen you can do zone transfers from AD to a specific server. Could you instead do a zone transfer from external to internal? (Without it overwriting all the internal records)
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Auditing Teams membership changes can help admins ensure that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive information. By regularly auditing membership changes, organizations can identify and address any potential security risks.
 Since Audit log search has limited customization, I have written a PowerShell script to track Teams membership changes with advanced capabilities.
 You can download the script from GitHub.
 Script Highlights:
  
The script uses modern authentication to retrieve audit logs.
 Exports all the teams’ membership changes
 The script has a filter to track private channel membership changes separately.
 It has a filter to monitor shared channel membership changes separately.
 Allows you to generate an audit report for a custom period.
 It can be executed with an MFA enabled account too.
 Exports report results to CSV file.
 Automatically installs the EXO V2 module (if not installed already) upon your confirmation.
 The script is scheduler-friendly. I.e., Credentials can be passed as a parameter instead of saved inside the script.
  
If you have any suggestion or additional requirements, I will update them in the next version.

 To keep it short- We have Active Directory in our company, with 300+ machines, of which ~50 are laptops.
 We have bad practices in the company - most of the laptop users don't bring laptops to the company (thus not connecting to the company LAN, not updating group policy, and some custom software) for long periods of time.
 The general idea is to FORCE them to bring laptops to the company once in a while (every 15-20 days) by automatically expiring their cached domain credentials after X days or X logins. Since M$ till this day doesn't offer any option to achieve this, I am wondering if maybe somebody had a similar situation and if there maybe is some workaround to achieve this?
 We have VPN (Checkpoint), but also can't force users to use it (also no option to keep it constantly connected- which by itself is also bad idea because there would be a lot of incoming traffic on servers).

I'm really happy about this, considering that I fell in love with it. Recently, we had some internal "problems" with the cybersec team (which is not in the IT dept anymore), and the question of the day is "who should do what?" Now that a lot of stuff has been migrated in the Purview portal, I think it's harder to identify who should have access to it and, in particular, define all the permissions. I think both the exchange admin and the security admin should have access to the portal, and it's mandatory that both the part talks before making any changes. What do you think/how do you handle this in your company?

 I have a new client who is still running SBS 2011 (I know, I know..), thankfully Exchange has been decommissioned and they are on 365 for mail. So it's basically just an old file server which needs to be replaced at some stage with something modern.
 However they still use the Remote Desktop facility built into SBS2011. They would like to keep this if possible or some new variation of it. Is it still supported in newer versions of Windows Server?

 I am currently trying to implement a MFA Solution for the company I work with. While Fido2 works just fine on a Desktop Enviroment to secure the M365 access it's utterly useless when the User has to work on a Terminal Server, because the Server does (for whatever reason) not recognise the Key so the User can't login into their M365 while working on the Terminal Server.
 And sadly mandating the Authenticator App on the private phone of an employee is not possible (legally), so I am looking for a solution that works on Terminal Servers to secure the M365 access.

 100% ubuntu environment with server and desktop
 I've played with aptly in the past but the process of having to do the mirrors/snapshots and publishing and everything can be a bit of a hassle to update the repos often. Not major gripe but it's just something.
 Apt-cacher-ng as a proxy seems promising as well. Haven't used it but pretty straight forward.
 Would it be better to just utilize the proxy instead of storing an entire mirror of all ubuntu repos locally? I feel it would be, since that would be a huge waste of space if we only use maybe 20% of the actual packages in the repo. Not going to waste time figuring out exactly what packages each system uses but if we utilize the proxy then it can cache what's needed and other systems can just grab from there if it's cached and cut down on network traffic going out.
 One main concern is being able to freeze the updates/packages so that we can update our test string, verify it works and then update the prod string with the same package versions and everything.
 Obvious workaround is just to take note of package version #s when we do the update to test string but while doable that would be annoying for some of the admins i'm sure and I want this as simple as possible.
 Is there a way to set apt-cacher-ng to have 2 cache directories?

 Which hosting are you using? Who in the world does this job best? Uninterrupted service and fast support in case of a problem are important.
 I don't believe in the "best hostings of 2022" articles, the best ones usually depend on how much you pay the company that wrote that article :)

My shift would be over before I find out that the image failed so troubleshooting is very tedious!
 Anyway, any imaging/switching experts can offer any advice? I think this is a job for multicast but I’m not too familiar. We use Aruba 6300 switches. The vlan they’re using has igmp snooping and pim-sparse configured. If there’s a quick and dirty fix I’ll take it! If there’s something in the ghost software I need to tweak I’m all for it! Anything to avoid using a clean switch and cabling everything to it (that’s their idea btw)

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month's updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft's Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft's updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work.
 Test, test, and test!

I'd be working with one other network guy who is more junior (guy just got his CCNA)
 Small offices and locations peppered around the US. Fortinet, Sonicwall, Meraki, Dell storage, Meraki/Fortinet wireless, with Microsoft Hyper V. Not too terribly complicated from what I can tell.
 They don't have any monitoring AFAIK, so I'll be helping them build out that infrastructure there.
 Given this context, what are some of your tips/questions to ask to acclimate yourself to a new environment? Any favorite documentation tools? Personal recommendations for log aggregation solutions?

 So I have been working for a company as a Help Desk Analyst i went in as a contractor and most recently i have been made full time my manager put me on a slack call with him and he told me the news 
 Before all this happened he knew for a while that i want to be a system administrator it has been my dream job he asked our director who runs the system administration team and he told my manager to tell me that he is not looking for anyone new at the moment 
 after he told me that he went on to say that I will be training you once a week and i told him that is very generous of you because he has a very busy schedule my manager is our service desk manager and he also does system administration
 I just want to know after all the training is “done” what happens to me because my manager went on to tell me that if my director does need a system administrator it won’t be for 2 to 3 years obviously he is just guessing and doesn’t know for sure. 
 I am really appreciative of the fact my manager is gonna trian me and i will get to learn and leverage my skills but i am young i don’t want to be in help desk for another second and i definitely do not want to wait 2 to 3 years to become system administrator 
 I am sorry for the long speech i just want to know after all the training is “done” what happens after? 
 also my manager told me “don’t worry you definitely will not stay in help desk” he tells me i am very ambitious.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. Would love thoughts/opinions on the best devices or type of devices or service. I have recently started at a small but growing enterprise. Company has 4 locations in the US and 3 in Asia. 3 locations have 200-300 users each and the rest are tiny. One of the larger sites hosts a single public facing application, accessed by our partners, nothing else is hosted publicly in the enterprise services (with the exception of client VPN). The rest have users mostly accessing Office 365, other SaaS applications and a smattering of internal applications. So far the long term goals of the company are:
  
To ideally consolidate all sites on a single platform - not a hard requirement if something else makes sense but right now it's a hodge podge and current gear is up for renewal and/or end of life. Everything is basic firewalls right now, no NGFW/UTM/SWG etc.
 To implement a greater degree of filtering/inspection/prevention/reporting and to ultimately integrate with an EDR/XDR platform for better visibility.
 To ideally eliminate our MPLS in favor of an SD-WAN, with redundant ISP's in each location
 To move all server workloads, including the single public facing app, to public cloud
  
The security vendor who my boss (CIO) has a relationship with is pushing him to buy their EDR/XDR platform along with their UTM's in every location. This is running a pretty high price tag and causing him to think about whether he can afford two for every location to have redundancy/fail over. I have a good networking foundation but my background is more on the server and storage side. At this point I am thinking that these UTM's at each location may be overkill for users surfing the internet. I am thinking there might be better/more cost effective alternatives. Or whether a hosted solution like zScaler or a competitor would be more cost effective. Ideally whatever solution we choose should have some way to integrate with an XDR platform.
 WWYD?
 thanks

 So Rackspace screwed up bigly and took down e-mail for over a week (ongoing). We've migrated all of our users to Office 365 and are currently using the Admin Center. 
 We want to totally disassociate from Rackspace completely-- but all the Office 365 Suite licenses are held there. We plan on purchasing them directly through O365 admin center--- but my main question is:
 Would we have to uninstall and re-install Office 365, or are we good as it stands?

 I am a lab equipment technician, and ran into a configuration I was unfamiliar with today and was wondering if some here might be able to help me understand a bit better. My networking knowledge is probably about a 4 out of 10. 
 We have an analyzer that processes patient samples and sends that data to an information management system. Normally its all TCP/IP, which allows me to easily switch the analyzer between communicating with a production server and a test server by switching the IP and PORT (which are both static). However I ran into one today that was configured with an ethernet to RS232 adapter. 
 Basically, 
 Analyzer(and analyzer PC) > Lantronix Box > Management System. 
 Parallel to that, 
 Analyzer(and analyzer PC)>Firewall>client network>analyzer diagnostic report exports to a website I can access from home. 
 I was just wondering what the purpose of running a seperate RS232/TCP/IP converter to the management system would be, if the analyzer and management system could be ran all via TCP/IP (which is what I normally see). 
 I tried to keep it concise without being too vague, but if there are more details I should include please let me know. 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is a link to the original.
 So I set up a meeting with my boss and I fumbled through a shitty 2 weeks notice. I told him I’m leaving. I didn’t want to hurt the guys feelings so I told him I need to be remote to be able to support my family more which is true but mainly I was sick of the constant lack of support while being handed project after project while trying to be an entire IT department for a large organization. 
 I kid you not I got the 5 stages of grief from him.
 In no particular order:
 Denial- what do you mean? Your not putting in your 2 weeks notice are you?
 Anger- There is no way I am going to be able to replace you by the deadline! Who gave you an offer? How much?
 Bargaining- Would you stay if gave you 5 grand? Can you please stay until march, I’ll let you work from home! We can work with you. Please let me work with you!
 Depression- I thought we were friends. I can take care of you. Give me a chance please! 
 Acceptance- you’ll want to hand in a formal notice of resignation if this is what you really want. 
 I didn’t want to tell him I accept an offer anywhere else but he kept patronizing me by telling me that money is gonna be tight and shit so i finally told him I got an offer somewhere else that gives me more freedom. He kept fucking grilling me to give him a chance to do good by me but it just felt weird. I told him I’d sleep on it cause I felt bad but I told him not to expect me to change my mind. Now he’s fucking texting me outside of work saying he spoke with the ceo so they can “make it work” for me to work remotely most of the time.
 TLDR; Gave 2 weeks notice and tried to be nice by focusing on a personal priority of mine instead of telling my boss what i really think and it back fired. 
 I’m handing in a formal resignation tomorrow hopefully it’s all just acceptance from there out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings. I'm struggling with creating an IPSEC connection between colocated server running Debian 11 and KVM/QEMU.
 It seems there's something "mysterious" about the virbr0 interface. I have a tunnel created using Strongswan IPSEC but it really only works in one direction. It acts like a firewall issue, but I've tried many things that make me believe it's more of a fundamental limitation of QEMU/Libvirt/virbr0.
 I've have created several tunnels with Strongswan, but this roadblock has me stumped.
 Has anyone successfully created an IPSEC tunnel with KVM host using strongswan and the default virbr0 network? I'd like to have my VMs reachable over the IPSEC tunnel and also allow the VMs to reach my local LAN.
 I can reach the VMs without issue, but I can't connect from the VM to my local LAN. I noticed the issue when trying to connect two KVM hypervisors over the internet with Strongswan IPSEC. I've been running Strongswan to connect to my VMs in the cloud for over a year, but never realized the tunnel really doesn't work in the other direction (other than ping/ICMP works).
 The basic oddity is like this: I can ping a remote LAN host over the tunnel, but if I run traceroute, it tries to go to the public interface first, which leads me to believe it's a limitation of virbr0.
 If anyone would like to help, here are my iptables on the kvm host.
 Local LAN = 192.168.7.0.24
 Remote virbr0/KVM LAN = 192.168.222.0/24
 Here's the strongswan config.
 I think the workaround is to create a tunnel using Wireguard, but I hate being defeated and would really like to learn what I'm doing wrong or not understanding.
 Thanks in advance to anyone willing to contribute.

        <updated>2022-12-13T00:23:34.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yep, the heading is the TL;DR.
 I recently purchased a SonicWall TZ270 for the family business as there was no sort of security infrastructure before. This is replacing what was just a basic home router.
 Ever since the firewall was implemented, there has been intermittent internet connectivity happening roughly 3x an hour lasting from 10 seconds-2 minutes. edit: closer to 5 minutes.
 ​
 Here is the current configuration:
 X0 - LAN 192.168.0.x
 X1 - WAN
 X3 - DEV 192.168.7.x
 X4 - SRV 192.168.5.x
 DHCP and DNS are on a Windows Server on the SRV network with IP Helper on the SonicWall. No issues with either of those.
 Ports are open for 2 services on 2 different servers - configured with wizard.
 ​
 Diagnosing:
 - Confirmed there are no duplicate DHCP or DNS servers
 - Disabled failover probing (known SW issue)
 - Ran packet traces
 - Pinged internal IP's, external IP's, internal hostnames, external hostnames for info
 - Reset to factory defaults, reconfigured as bare-metal as possible
 ​
 It looks like when the internet connectivity drops, I lose access to the WAN, both hostnames and IP's, but not anything on the internal network. I managed to catch the drop on 1 packet trace on the firewall and it dropped nearly 400 packets in a split second, all blaming either multicast not being configured, or something on the wrong subnet (known issue with this ISP).
 ​
 Is there ANYTHING else I can check? Or do I throw this out and just get a Sophos?

 Not the worst description I've seen, but still very unhelpful. Not sure why it's so hard for users to provide any details. Is this a file from a website? Some internal application? Elsewhere? Are you using a browser? Which one? Are there any error messages? At the very least, can you provide a phone number that I can call to talk to you to get this information?
 I gently responded to the ticket asking for more details (including some prompts to make it easier). Crickets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have been racking my brain and researching this issue for about a week now. Sorry if this doesn't fit here.
 The issue I've been having, is that from a oracle cloud ampere server (with a 4 Gbps link) located about 1200 km away, with 34 ms of latency, I cannot seem to get more than about 100 Mbps to my local connection. 
 I have tested it using iperf3, and even if I tinker with the settings to adjust threads it will not get any more than 100 Mbps. I have changed the mtu on both machines, changed the max tcp window size, and tried to change the hardware settings for nics on both of the machines. When I run a udp iperf3 test, I can reach the maximum speed my connection allows (1 Gbps).
 The reason why I believe more bandwidth should be possible is that when I use a wireguard vpn, I can reach tcp speeds through that connection to the server, above 600 mbps. Also, a speedtest from the server to a local speedtest server is about 1500 Mbps, and my connection to that same speedtest is at 1000 Mbps.
 I am not sure if this is just bad routing, or bandwidth delay product. Could someone shed some light on this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there even a big software company that provides even middling support these days?
 This weekend was a final migration from on-prem file server to Box. Users had been warned for weeks that this was coming, that the Box app had already been pushed to their computer, and that they needed to sign in to see how it worked so they would understand how everything worked and how to access shared files once the server is down.
 Of course most users ignored this and so, expecting exactly that, I was on site first thing today to get them going.
 Unfortunately things went sideways and most people who hadn't already signed in were unable to. The company uses Google Workspace so Box had been added as a SSO app through SAML, but signing in with their Google credentials either produced a prompt to create a password (???) or an error saying "invalid credentials".
 I immediately created a ticket with tons of detail and SAML traces, got a pretty quick reply from a T1 tech who said that the accounts I referenced didn't have passwords and could I please have the users create them. After a bit of back and forth about what "SSO" stands for he escalated the ticket.
 Hours passed. Frantic web searches yielded nothing. I looked through the SAML traces myself and couldn't find anything (I know nothing about web dev but figured I'd try). I called the Box account manager, who also "escalated". Updated the ticket email with more details. Called the account manager again. Had the customer's CFO call the account manager with me on the line.
 5 hours later I got a reply from someone claiming to be a T2 tech, asking for a SAML trace from an affected user.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am experiencing some very odd TLS negotiation behavior between one of our clients and the webserver/LB (different sites).
 This is only affecting one LB for only one subnet in our VDI env (no other client has presented any problems).
 I can see traffic is leaving the VDI firewall and hitting the edge in front of the web server and then leaving, however, the FW outside our VDI env is not seeing any return traffic (I find this odd since Wireshark on the client shows reset packets as well as other ACK being sent from the webserver).
 Now here is where TLS comes in. I am seeing in a Wireshark capture multiple other connections going through the same edge FWs are negotiating at TLS v1.2 and are successful. But only this one is negotiating by default as TLS v1.0 by the client and then getting a reset (since we reject v1.0 and 1.1). I have tried forcing TLS v1.2 at the browser level on the client and it still negotiates at v1.0.
 The only thing I haven't tried (since I don't have admin access to the VDI machines) is doing the windows OS-level registry change for removing TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1
 Any suggestions?

 ​
 I left my previous role (Head of IT (was very hands-on/3rd line)) for an educational establishment in early 2021 as I needed a break and wanted to try something new (self empself-employedloyed retail business).
 ​
 It's been almost two years, and I'm ready to jump back into IT but struggling to land an interview.
 ​
 I do not want to go back into management. I always enjoyed the sysadmin and project side of the role, but I hated the management side. It wasn't my choice to get into management but something that happened over several years.
 ​
 Anyway, I've been applying for 2nd line/3rd line support roles as well as project-based infrastructure engineer roles. I haven't had one interview request with about 60 applications.
 ​
 I'm considering spending some downtime to re-train for a specific role since my previous roles were very general sysadmin and network support.
 ​
 I've considered either Cloud or Cyber Sec, but leaning more towards Cloud as I am more familiar with it. Likely Azure as I have had exposure to it. 
 ​
 My questions are:
  
If I pass a couple of Azure certs, am I likely to get a Azure-based role without practical experience working with Azure, considering I have 10 years of network/IT support experience?
 What over avenues can I go down to try to land a job back in IT?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ubiquiti/Unifi still just seems completely non-ready for the workplace, and I've been using them for years now in spite of it.
 Trying to work on a budget here, so good Meraki gear is out of the question. A year or two ago or so, one of the UniFi "controller" upgrades put a bunch of our older, perfectly-functioning AP's out of management scope. They still run but we can't change any SSID settings or even see how many clients are connected because the hardware is EOL. I could understand a nag screen or something, but to actually take functionality away from perfectly functional hardware? Come on now.
 So we bite the bullet and pick up some new U6-LR AP's. Oh fantastic, now they are pulling 16+ watts each and overpowering the PoE switches, leading to constant reboots of the APs. Cool - it's one of the bugs that is fixed in the new UniFi "Network Application", let's upgrade that again.
 Nope! That requires installing Java 11, which seems to be either unobtainable or undetectable, because I've installed at least 3 different versions of JDK, OpenJDK, some weird third-party extraction of JRE 11, and some other garbage, just for the UniFi installer to tell me it still needs Java 11 and quit the installer. Why does the latest Unifi software not use the latest Java? We're on version 19 now for God's sake.
 So now I can't access old hardware, can't use new hardware, can't upgrade the software, and if I'm able to install it I'm sure I will run into some other new stupidity, plus have to hack my way into making it a service again because it's only a console application for some ridiculous reason.

We have about a half dozen subscriptions for Azure and each one has many resource groups. 
 ​
 In tests it looks like the market place image is easy to deploy, though it isn't what we want. Looks like custom images are tied directly into the resource group and I think, if I undrestand it correctly, we need to have a gallery to be able to use an image within the other resource groups in the same subscription, though need a seperate gallery for each subscription? It feels like there are a lot of different settings when it comes to creating an image and Azure is very picky, yet very unforgiving about things. Simple things like changing names of the image can't be done, you have to create a new image w/ the name you want.
 ​
 Due to inforced RBAC, we can only create and delete VMs, we can't create Images, which is an internal problem that we have. So it doesn't help that we have a seperate team working on it, though we are trying to have that role added to our group. The other team, which is part of the Windows Team uses Market Place Image for their stuff, so they don't have much experience with creating gold images.
 ​
 Also the latency between the cloud and our on prem enviornment seems to introduce a lot of other issues, we have to up timeouts in tools that we have no issue communicating across the country to our sister DC, though communicating between our DC and Azure in the same side of the country has time out issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have recently taken a position as IT director and my predecessor was painfully parsimonious - to the extent that he was bragging about getting our main production switches - HP 1910's from an online seller of refurbished gear for $150 each. Now, one of our several firewalls (no, I don't know why there are several, but there are) has failed, and we have consumed the cold spare that was on the shelf, but the device is old enough to no longer be available for sale new. I'd like to unify our firewall duties into a single unit (or, preferably an HA pair), and wanted to see if anyone here has advise about any of the devices I'm considering. I have a personal bias toward the Palo's, since I spent the last two years piloting a pair of 5220s. Also, my network manager has an interest in Fortinet in particular, since they offer a full stack of gear - FW, switches, and APs. I also am not interested in Cisco, partly because the $250k order I placed at my former place of employment is on month 14 without fulfillment, with no end in sight. 
 Here's the list, and thanks for looking:

 My question is how does the upstream router know which subnet to serve DHCP on?

 10.0.20.0/24 - Non working
 When request sent from pgadmin client to pgpool from non-working subnet, it takes about 15seconds for only one single packet to get processed. This happens at start of connection after three-way handshake.
 After that particular packet, subsequent packets are having <1ms RTT.
 From the same non-working setup, if we bypass pgpool, and directly access db, it works well.
 What could possibly causing this issue?
 It is consistently reproducible.

 A little background info before we start : I am originaly come from a software developper background. After some misshaps in my personal life, i've had difficulties finding a job as a developper. I then decided to apply for helpdesk positions at multiple local companies and landed myself a job at the local university.The job was advertised as a "helpdesk" position.
 I've been working there for the past 1.5 years. The transition with the person before me was a little rocky at first since i had so much to learn in so little time (AD / GPOs / Imaging / Networking ...) and i'm still learning new stuff everyday.
 I manage around 150-200 Windows 10 machines. The department uses a variety of CAD softwares ( CATIA / Inspire / MoldFlow / MSC Patran_Nastran / Vericut ...) but they mostly use SolidWorks.
 The person before used to create a windows image every year with the latest version of the softwares they use. This created a problem where the images he created were at the very least 75gb. I've been able to move away from this by automating most of the installs with scripts.
 Now that i think i have the basics down, i'd like to optimize the process and find ways to deal with SolidWorks configs in a multi-user environment.

On server side we are using switch independent teaming with dynamic load balancing with specific standby server. Whenever firewall changes from primary to secondary due to one link failure on one of server, primary firewall switches off all its connected ports to change connected servers teaming on standby mode. Now after sometimes primary firewall's all port switches on though secondary firewall is running. Now as server's active ports are on server teaming switches back to primary and firewall still in passive mode. Is there any way I can retain server NIC teaming to last state irrespective of primary port availability on server 2019.

 So we have a few locations where machines are randomly dying, (dell and hp), the users sometimes see an applocker style message saying an application cannot be run, please contact your system administrator, then if they reboot the machine goes into a state where it never fully boots, no real pattern at all, only oddity is they are all W10 pro boxes, and applocker is present in the domain, but those SKU's cannot run applocker (although it is logging that).
 This has only just started happening (1 end of last week, now we are seeing a lot more), anyone else seeing this?

 We've noticed every Wednesday they are installed, we'll have a random user or 2 that then can't get on via DA the next day from home. A few reboots and appears to resolve itself.
 One machine I looked at I ran
 WMIC qfe list full (not sure how accurate this command is)
 On the Wednesday it showed KB5020487 installed on a machine and then the next day DA didn't work. A few reboots later it was back working.
 Searching for KB5020487 it doesn't exist on Microsoft's KB catalog. I've now looked at other machines that haven't had DA issues but also seeing KBs being installed on the Wednesday that have no Microsoft link in their "caption" entry and don't appear in the catalog. Another one on mine I've found from November KB5020372.
 n-able is the MPS software they use.
 UPDATE before finished typing :
 Looked at a machine that has Windows 11 that's not on the domain and it to has entries with a KB installed that has no reference in the catalog KB5017233. This odd entries are appearing in Windows 10 machines as well.
 Odd.

 In our environment we have end users which might be using any type of means to access an application (mobile, browser, citrix). Then this goes to a SaaS, then to k8s in GCP, then to an in-house developed App which is on-prem, and then to a good old backend (also on-prem). 
 Is it possible at all to keep the session ID as you pass all these steps, so that your modern session-based performance troubleshooting which you get in the microservices world, as you move to your legacy apps (in my case everything after the GCP).

 I've got a broken Server 2016 (HRESULT = 0x800f0805 - CBS_E_INVALID_PACKAGE on everything, no installed updates found, not able to add/remove roles and features, etc)
 This is a single domain-controller environment and I need to get this lifted over to a new install. (2019/2022)
 Migrating the DC itself is an OK process, but what is the most effective and least troublesome way of transferring folder redirection for 40 users to the new DC?
 I've done this once before by just robocopying eveything (with permissions and so forth) and all and change the path on the GPO, but two years later I still have calls regarding old paths.
 I've read that "copy content" is a dangerous option and I assume copying everything back to local requires everyone to re-log and will cause performance issues?
 Another thing I've read is to use DFS, however I have never touched DFS - is this the best way?
 I'd like to do it the correct way this time - what would be the best way? How is this done by the book with no future shit happening?
 EDIT: I've seen this Storage Migration Services as well, but that claims that DC's are not supported

I deleted all of the certificate files, I have tried to restart docker and the daemon. I have also tried to remove the override file that I tried to put the certificate in. To create the self-signed SSL certificate, I used the following script https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexisAhmed/DockerSecurityEssentials/main/Docker-TLS-Authentication/secure-docker-daemon.sh
 For the override.conf file within /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/override.conf I used the following configuration: [Service]ExecStart=ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -D -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock --tlsverify --tlscert=/home//.docker/server-cert.pem --tlscacert=/home//.docker/ca.pem --tlskey=/home//.docker/server-key.pem -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2376
 I have restarted the docker container but that has also failed to work.
 Furthermore, I have also deleted the ssl certificate so I have no idea where it is pulling the old on from.

 Their core belief is "security is something that should be accessible to everyone" and they really actually mean it. If you don't know them, let me introduce you to some of their services
  
The fastest DNS resolver in the world with high regards on privacy (free)
 DNS for families that protect against malware and/or adult content (free)
 An extremely affordable ZTNA solution (free for <50 users)
 A WAF, SSL/TLS and DDoS Protection (free for standard usecases)
  
Thank you cloudflare, for making security available to everyone, especially for private usage and small companies too.
 I highly recommend cloudflare, and I am absolutely stunned by their portfolio, their generosity and what they do. Great stuff!

We have an old windows 2012 server that acts as a DHCP server. A few switches and access points for wifi devices. On the edge of the network there is a Cisco firepower 1120 outside connected to the ISP and inside is connected to the main switch. We use this for RA VPN and we can reach the internet through this. We have no router, only switches and acces points.
 The problem is when the firewall is down the subnet becomes unresponsive, devices cannot ping eachother, sometimes new devices do net get IP addresses. If the firewall is removed computers should be able to arp and find other devices, and we should still get IP addresses since we have a DHCP server. In the firewall DHCP server is disabled. 
 We had an old ASA firewall and the issue was the same with that one, but I would like to get to the bottom of this problem. The firewall config is almost default, one acl to allow internet access, dhcp disabled, RA VPN enabled. NAT is the default dynamic inside,outside.
 ​
 Does anyone have an idea what could be the problem? Does this has anything to do with proxy arp?

Occasionally I need to configure a device and have it sent to them, and because they use it all day, they need it to arrive already configured, logged in, applications set up etc etc.
 ​
 We're using InTune with AzureAD authentication, a mixture of Windows laptops/tablets and Android phones. We're encrypting the devices before sending them out etc.
 ​
 The main issue I'm having is that before I can configure a device, I need to contact the user and ask for their password. Sometimes the user is unavailable, and I can't get hold of them, which delays things, and I also worry that taking a note of their password is a bad practice.
 ​
 I wonder if there is a way that I can configure the devices and sign into the user's corporate accounts on the devices without needing their password. If not, then what is the best practice to do this?

 We have recently begun seeing multiple users complaining that when they are working on a Terminal Server with a multi monitor setup, that they will periodically and at random get disconnected to one of their monitors, so the sessions stays open and they can keep on working, but only on that single monitor.
 They have to completely restart the Terminal Server or do a complete log out and log in, in order for it to connect to both monitors again.
 Hope this makes just some sence, because i sure a heck could not google it
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi fellow sys admins,
 I'm trying to deal with a very interesting (to me) case. Someone is proxy-mirroring all content of my website under a different domain name.
  
Original: https://www.saashub.com
 Abuser/Proxy-mirror: https://sukuns.us.to
  
My ideas of resolution:
  
Block them by IP - That doesn't work as they are rotating the IP from which the request is coming.
 Block them by User Agent - They are duplicating the user-agent of the person making the request to sukuns.us.to
 Add some JavaScript to redirect to the original domain-name - They are stripping all JS.
 Use absolute URLs everywhere - they are rewriting everything www.saashub.com to their domain name.
  
i.e. I'm out of ideas. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.
 p.s. what is more, Bing is indexing all of SaaSHub's content under sukuns.us.to ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I've reported a copyright infringement, but I have a feeling that it could take ages to get resolved.

 Some prerequisite info:
 CRC is a very commonly used way to detect errors in computer networks.
 P(x), G(x), R(x), and T(x) are all polynomials under binary field arithmetic (i.e., all coefficients are mod2: 0 or 1).
 P(x) is the polynomial that we are given and that we will divide by.
 E(x) is an error pattern. It is XORed with T(x) to get T'(x). G(x) is the message that we want to send.
 R(x) is the remainder of G(x)/P(x) or just G(x)modP(x).
 T(x) is our sent data, (x^k)G(x)+R(x), where k is the degree of P(x).
 T'(x) is our received data but potentially with errors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I run a vpn server with the interface tun0 on a server. I want to open the SSH port on this server so that the ssh connection is allowed only after VPN authentication.
 Which of the following firewall rules is correct:
  
specifying the tunnel:
 ufw allow in on tun0 from any to any port 22 
 
specifying the VPN IP address:
 ufw allow from 10.8.0.2 to any port 22 
 
 Let’s say the server is at 10.8.0.1, and there is only one client at 10.8.0.2. 
 For the second rule, the interface tun0 is not specified. The IP address 10.8.0.2 is not unique. What if the packet comes from an external private IP 10.8.0.2 to the default interface eth0, not from the 10.8.0.2 in the tunnel ? It seems to me the interface must be specified not the IP, to restrict SSH to VPN.
 For the first rule, I suppose the request from 10.8.0.2 first goes to the VPN gateway, say, 10.8.0.0, and then to 10.8.0.1. So shouldn’t it be “from 10.8.0.0”?
 Another question: For the “to any,” if I specify “to 10.8.0.1,” would that prevent NAT masquerading, thus login rejection?

 To put my mind at ease I’ve been thinking about encrypting the traffic, but it’s not something I’ve done before. The switches are both Cisco 9200L. Is it relatively easy to accomplish and is there any added latency?

 Calling all HP 3Par all stars - am I barking up the wrong tree here? Can I do this, will it work?
 We've recently decommissioned/replaced three x HP 3Par SAN's. 1 x 7200 and 2 x 8200's. All are still functional, just out of maintenance.
 I'm contemplating building a Frankenmonster play unit and/or get out of jail free card should bad things happen.
 My thoughts were to take one of the 8200's (being newer) and harvest the others for all the good stuff - SSD's, RAM, an external disk shelf from the 7200 etc and build something as big and as good as possible given the bits I've got.
 Can I do this with the 3Par platform? I do it all the time with old servers, what about storage?
 Oh - and this will all be 100% offline too - I've kept the old FC switches and a couple of old ESX hosts to build an unsupported play area.
 Any thoughts/comments/traps greatly appreciated.
 Cheers,

It has around 400 users( students, teachers etc) and has around 200 computers but there not managed by a ad server or any server, there are some print server and smb share but it's kinda minimum for that many devices. So I asked if I could set up a ad server for loging in and deploying software. They said there's no money for buying a windows server standard license. My thought to overcome this issue is to install ad server on a Linux server. But with that many users and many features like wsus and many other features not present in Linux ad implementation is it a good idea or should I just leave it alone and make milion local users

 We were asked to block all RDPs on our network, and while I have most successfully blocked wither via the firwall or GPO, Splashtop seems to be a massive issue for us. We cannot block it through the firewall, and we are talking to the vendors as they are just as confused as we are. HOWEVER, I decided to block splashtop via GPO and it it still gains access to the internal PCs. 
 I have it blocked for users and computers using both the 'don't run specified application' and software restriction policies and the app still gets through. Any idea what the hell is going on? I have never seen this crap before.

 For example, if it the packet starts with a TTL=100 and it appears that there is 19 hops in the trace route but two of them are “request timed out”, the TTL will be equal to 19, 17, 18 or 16 (depends if the last row decrease the TTL or no?)

Consider this an environment where the likes of Fortinet, Sonicwall or Palo Alto is cost prohibitive. Have come across vendors that are offering generic devices that can they claim to do the same functions without a lot name recognition. One issue I have run into is the ability assess these devices as they aren't put through a lot of certification processes or community voices around them.
 Has anyone been down this path before? what did you look for in a successful implementation. How did your solution scale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to replace existing Juniper gear with HPE 5900AF switches. As I don't have that much experience with HPE/Comware, I need some help.
 What the setup should look like:
 ​
 2x 10GbE Ports coming from the upstream provider, running BGP on their end. That means: BGP to the upstream provider, announcing multiple IPv4 and v6 subnets but only taking a default route.
 Customers will also terminate on the switch with a seperate vlan for each customer (And on a seperate port for each customer.) Inside of that VLAN, there will be one gateway address .1. 
 Is there something like l3Interface in Comware like it exists on JunOS or how do I connect the customer vlans to the upstream provider with the default route? Or do I need a bridge like interface for this?
 Also, are the switches capable of line rate L3 features like ACLs? Or will they suffer and choke with a few ACLs/sFlow on some ports?
 Any help is appreciated.

I'm also 42 with only one kid left at home but she has one foot out the door so it'll just be my wife and the cat with little expenses so I'm OK with the pay cut if it's low stress and good bennies. I keep looking at the IT landscape and feel like it's going to change very fast over the next few years with consolidation (cloud/saas) and competition for jobs is increasing. I don't want to deal with that now.
 I see quite a few government job openings around the 100k range (plus wife's salary) and keep thinking that's good enough for me to coast until retirement and I know a few folks who work there saying it's gravy work. Plus there's that 20-and-out retirement I keep reading about. But I don't want to be doing absolutely anything though cause that would just suck.
 So anyway, folks who work in the government how do you like it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 For our organization we need to deploying different PAC files to users depending on their association.
 For historical reasons this is supposed to be done in the form
 http://<IP>:8001 -> hand out PAC script1
 http://<IP>:8002 -> hand out PAC script2, etc
 Now I just want to make sure my solution is viable.
 My idea is to just take a good old Apache, have it listen on all the required ports and set the DirectoryIndex to the matching PAC file.
 Would that work?

 Android smartphone however, I want to get onboard but overall, just frustrating to use...
 Mobile use cons;
 - Text Input mode; sometimes does not register, just continues to collect input but it does not transverse through to the other end.
 - Challenging to call up the in session menu to change input method, swipe from left to right just usually exits the app due to androids native navigation method.
 - Mouse emulation method, I've always defaulted to "drag to move" yet, with this setting enabled, I can no longer pinch to zoom which is another hurdle to overcome.
 Like what are the workarounds to make this an enjoyable experience on a mobile device without a keyboard and mouse?

 I'm a developer and sysadmin. Lots of VMware, Ansible, Docker, OpenVPN. Have a tiny bit of experience with AWS, CI/CD (Github Actions), Networking & Security knowledge. I love Linux, tolerate Windows. Most of my programming experience has been with Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and Python but I'm learning Golang. 
 Disadvantages: No certs, but I'm considering studying for one of the AWS certs. I have a half finished CS degree, couldn't complete for financial reasons. 
 My current role is independent contractor for a couple small Canadian businesses. I'm definitely undercharging them ($25/hour CAD) but that's a damn good rate here in South America. 
 How much should I be charging new clients?

 The best I've come up with so far is to make an aliased script or program (in some non-powershell language) somewhere in %PATH%, which starts powershell with -bypass, and have "set-executionpolicy Restricted -scope process" as the last line in the profile script - clunky, but at least the spirit of the execution policy would be preserved.

 So we just had multiple clients bite the dust when it comes to e-mail because of the whole Rackspace Ransomware attack. I was just wondering if anybody had any tips for getting some of my clients' Office 365 software clients synced and running correctly. So far my process has been this:
 - Remote in through Teamviewer
 - Open Outlook
 - Backup .PST files (some of these folks have multiple mailboxes, so I make separate backups for each, which is a total pain and very tedious and time consuming)
 - Delete Profile from Control Panel > Mail Credentials
 - Run Outlook & Put In Email Address & P/W
 - Import .PST Files
 There has to be a better way. Like, I thought I should just be able to tell the email software that Hey! This is now Office 365! And then it just automatically swaps over or something. Is this really the only way to do this? Thank you for any help/tips. It is greatly appreciated as it looks like I'm starring down the barrel of a full week of 10 hour+ days if this is how it has to be. Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Do live streaming services like Twitch, YouTube (when live), etc. use IP multicasting on at least part of the path from the server to the viewers?
 Or is there an individual connection for each viewer, that carries the same data?
 It would seem very inefficient, because the same data would be transferred many times over some internet backbones, to go to all the viewers in some area.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 My organization is trying to establish better security policies and one of our issues is the visitation of consultants. We give them limited access on our network, but one thing I’m curious about is direct IP printing. 
 I feel uneasy about granting those users direct IP printing abilities as I don’t manage their devices. 
 From your experience, what are the risks of direct IP printing from folks outside of your organization?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Team,
 How do you guys describe your role as a network engineer to non-technical folks?
 I've gotten into the habit of just saying I work in "IT" to describe what I do for a living to everyone. But this past week, I was recently hired on as a Sr. Network Engineer for this new company and attended a group onboard meeting. It was just me, a new exec, and the HR person.
 We were asked to describe our roles, and I said "IT" work. Without missing a beat, the exec took out his phone, immediately handed it to me, and asked me to tshoot why it was so slow.
 I half-jokingly said that they'll need a ticket before I can do any type of work and expanded that I will be leading the team on the transition, design, and implementation of new acquisition networks, implementing security policies, and datacenter/cloud work. Connectivity. HR lady jumps in and says I fix the WiFi and VPN.
 Later that day, I was out celebrating with friends and met someone new who asked me what I do for a living. I jokingly responded network engineer, I fix WiFi and VPN. My partner got upset and asked why I degrade myself...
 Interested in hearing what you guys say when this question pops up.

 I have quick formatted them in Windows but I found that I can use Mac Disk Utility secure erase with several passes on the drives.
 I was wondering if there is any need to use a tool like DBAN to wipe them, or is secure erase good enough on the Mac? I have an external HDD reader so that lets me wipe the drives on any of my Mac or Windows systems. Or maybe just a hammer and drill could be used and no software wipe at all, thought on this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The only IT employee quit a day after I was hired, just long enough to provide credentials to everything. I've been taking inventory, and the products we have issued out + new in box (about three dozen units) isn't matching up with how many were purchased on their respective websites.
 1) The highest tier warranty was purchased. 2) Computrace was not purchased or used on any device. 3) All devices have vPro. 4) We don't use a volume license; everything is OEM image that's been removed of some preinstalled programs, then GPO when joined to the domain. 5) How would I check to see if any Out Of Band management was used?
 I'm not looking to get anyone in trouble. Just want to cover my ass. Even something like a "last powered on" date would be helpful. It's also possible that these are still in service somewhere, maybe even off the domain and/or without network connectivity. 
 Thanks for any help.
 EDIT: I have used almost every method mentioned here thus far, to no avail. I'm specifically looking for tools that Lenovo or Dell may have. To be bluntly clear, I am trying to locate about 9 devices that were purchased, with an order and serial number associated to the devices, but are nowhere to be found. Only 2 of 9 of these devices were once domain-joined computers. So, I'm suspecting 7 of these devices have possibly been stolen, and I need some way to cover my ass. It's a smallish company and HR hates me as it is.

Works really cool for IoT type devices that can join WPA3 or 802.1x networks. 
 However, I want to add another feature that I think would be cool. Which is detecting the network layer ones using SNMP messages. So I wanted to know if anyone had a cool place to get a bunch of dumps of SNMP traffic or the raw models that the vendors use.

 I need to create a lab environment for each user.
 Users will be able to open a specially created linux machine with novnc and manage it through the browser. By running vulnerable machines in a lab environment, isolated machines and networks must be created for each user.
 If the user wants to scan the vulnerable target machines isolated for him using his own physical computer, he will be able to access it with VPN.
 If he does not want to use VPN and physical computer, he will be able to reach target machines with novnc.
 All they need to do is press a button.
 I tried using proxmox, openvpn, pfsense for this, I tried to create vlans for each user, but I thought it would be inefficient and difficult.
 I am currently researching cloud management software in the style of cloudstack, how do you think I can do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is probably a dumb question, but I am really confused by ZTNA. I know ZTNA stands for Zero Trust Network Architecture, but I was under the impression that it was a philosophy/goal not an actual software or product. 
 With that said, I am really confused as to what these ZTNA softwares actually do? How is Sophos ZTNA or FortiClient ZTNA any different from a normal VPN? How is ZTNA firewall any different from a normal one?
 I have been wondering this for a while because I keep seeing software companies coming out with there own ZTNA specific products, yet I don’t understand the difference.

 Same page loads fine if I use an older version of Edge on a server 2012r2 device running edge 108.0.1462.46 (Official build) (64-bit)
 The pages used to load fine on the 2019 server and all the servers in same subnet.
 Trying in IE mode does not improve the situation, nor does using an inPrivate window
 Any ideas what else I can try?

 EDIT: Servers are all VMs, when i try from a 2019 host it works fine.
 EDIT 2: If I use a portable edition of Firefox on the Print server VM, it also works fine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Had a fun 48 hours. Noticed one of my scheduled backups failed and took a look at our NAS (backups for offline storage) and one of the drives was down on our raid 6. Also noticed a fan was down in the logs in the idrac. 
 Okay, put in a service ticket as it's under warranty. Go home and think nothing of it. 
 2nd shift tech shoots me a message in the middle of the night that he noticed something revving up in our DC but couldn't pinpoint it - then goes home. While everyone is sleeping the idrac shuts the NAS down on it's own overnight. I come in next day, can't remote into it so I find out it is offline, then plug in a crash cart. All the volumes showing as foreign and the config is gone.
 OK - little worried. Check the idrac and see all the volumes disconnected from the raid controller. Bump up the escalation on the service ticket and engineer comes out within a few hours. 
 We replace 1x drive, 2x fans. Bright orange dell fans were now black and a little melty. Forced to acknowledge all the volumes as foreign and reload the config. Thankfully everything boots as it should and that knot in my stomach releases a bit.
 Apparently if you lose 2 of 5 fans, the unit shuts itself down to protect from heat damage. The more you knowwww!
 Not sure why the config was wiped other than perhaps the shutdown was not the most graceful.

LGPO is a command line program that lets you dump the current LOCAL not domain GPO to a text file then convert it back to a policy and import it. Working with it via powershell is a bit clunky, you need to do use Start-Process with CMD as admin to do anything but it works! Just thought I’d give an update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 This maybe a little off topic, so feel free to say i should post it elsewhere.
 I am trying to help out a charity with their mess of a computer system, they currently access their emails via Gmail Workspace and some of these mailbox’s are large at over 15GB.
 They have got Microsoft Business 365 Premium for free as they are a nonprofit and they want to move everything over to Microsoft.
 This is not something I have done before and I'm hoping will be something useful for me to learn more about.
 So I believe from the Microsoft Admin Centre I can migrate the emails across from Gmail into Microsoft and then the DNS servers will just need to be changed from the current Gmail ones to the Microsoft DNS servers? 
 Then set up the desktop Outlook app to connect to the new Exchange server 
 I found this guide for the migration here - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mailbox-migration/migrating-imap-mailboxes/migrate-g-suite-mailboxes but I am a little concerned about relying on Google and MS to talk to each other properly and do the import correctly. My original idea was to just drag all the emails from their Google Workspace into a local pst file on Outlook desktop app then after changing over to M365 to copy them back across. More labour intensive but safer?
 Also if I do the migration for a 15GB mailbox I expect that to take several hours and theres a good chance emails will be received during that time so what happens to them?
 Have I missed anything out?
 One thing that does concern me is that at the top of that page it says "Effective from December 2022, the classic Exchange Admin Center will be deprecated for worldwide customers. Microsoft recommends using the new Exchange Admin Center, if not already doing so. "
 The further down in step 5 it says "IMAP migration is not available for new EAC. " 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I'm working on some FileShare permissions as a cleanup project; by default, our permissions are applied to a top-level file share folder. Different permissions may be applied to a subfolder no more than one level below the top-level file share. 
 We are actively trying to enforce that any other folder permissions needed which don’t fit this model should use a separate subfolder under the top-level file share folder (i.e., \Server1\Accounting\CustomFolder ). 
 I'm trying to tackle this with PowerShell and the NTFSSecurity module if we have a "Read Only Group" and a "Read Write AD group" applied in the ACLs. I want to get the AD RO or RW group members and see if they are in any folders deep than that to clean it up. 
 Example: Share1/Dept/Folder1/Folder2/Folder3 If Joe Doe is already in an AD group at the Dept folder and then some admin added him directly to Folder3, I'll like to have a report showing that.
 I've been doing PS for around six months now, I can do one-liners pretty well, but I need help to write scripts. I would appreciate any guidance you can give me, and if I asked a stupid question or worded it poorly, please let me know! Some of the scripts I've been using are: 
 $notInherited = Get-ChildItem -Path "\\Server1\DeptFolder" -Directory -Recurse | Get-NTFSAccess | Where-Object {!($_.IsInherited)} $notInherited | Export-Excel C:\Temp\Spreadsheets\Data_NotInherited.xlsx -TableName Permissions -AutoSize

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm looking to learn more about colocation and networking in the data center environment. Essentially, I have a few servers that I want to put into a rack in a data center but I'm tossed up on what direction I should start with.
 The first topic is the choice of networking equipment. The data center provides a 1 Gbps SFP connection. Now, I could plug that directly into a switch and have a server in the rack that handles DHCP, but are there any good cheap switches that have a DHCP server built in that also allows for easy remote management? 
 The first setup I was looking at using was a Ubiquiti Dream Machine SE and a Ubiquti Pro switch. I would plug the SFP from the data center into the Dream Machine, then another SFP from the Dream Machine into the Pro Switch. Ubiquiti was a choice due to the familiarity of knowing how to manage the settings on both devices.
 The second setup was looking into Cisco Meraki devices, however, I'm not familiar with Cisco's product lineup. I do have my CompTIA A+ and Network+, so I am somewhat familiar with using the CLI, but the program I was in only had us focus on managing Cisco devices on a LAN through the CLI only. I was scrolling through threads on WHT and several times Cisco Meraki devices came up. Does anyone know if Cisco Meraki devices have a built in DHCP server? If not, then I would still need to have a DHCP server setup in the rack.
 Also, does anyone have any recommendations on material that I can use to help better understand networking concepts and practices in the data center regarding how to setup and manage BGP, how to assign IPv4 subnets to specific devices, or personal advice with first time colocation experiences?
 Thank you in advance!

 {{hostname}}.{{network_type}}.{{state/province}}.example.com
 {{hostname}}.{{airportcode}}.{{countrycode}}.example.com
 Etc.
 My question here is: in the context of a (W)ISP with various services (internet, TV, phone), what do you guys suggest regarding naming standards when it comes to hyphens and dots, particularly in the hostname portion? Do you prefer over over the other? Why?
 What's a naming scheme that really stuck out to you in your environment(s) as being very useful and easily let's you identify devices just by their names? 
 Thanks in advance. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in the process of working through a 10G fiber installation (upgrading from 1G copper) and I'm the person who ran all the fiber in my data center. I'm not a networking person, more of a SysAdmin, so I admittedly don't know a ton about networking equipment.
 During the cutover, one of the corporate IT network guys said there were a bunch of CRC errors on one piece of network equipment or another, and that this was causing really bad slowness. We were then instructed to replace any fiber cables shorter than 2 meters with longer ones. We had a number of 1M cables in place. Apparently (I didn't see for myself) the errors went away after this was done. I understand that the IEEE standard says 2M minimum for SR fiber, but I thought that was mainly due to Tx levels potentially being higher than the Rx threshold and damaging the equipment.
 How does it cause CRC errors as well?

I was able to install and set up the machine and share the drives that they wanted to be shared but I'm unable to allow users to enter their credentials to connect. Currently the only way it works for me is if it's passwordless, otherwise anytime anyone tries to connect it says that they're not authorized to do so. I figured I could solve this by adding the server 2019 machine to their domain but so far I haven't had any luck. I keep getting an error saying it found the DNS but can't connect. Can anyone help me out please? I'll edit this with the exact errors soon I'm heading in to the office now

 Problem: 
 We have an enterprise network with 50+ sites. These sites all have SDWAN routers/Cisco switches utilizing VLANS. Most of these sites have UPS’ connected via Ethernet for monitoring purposes. I need to know which interfaces these UPS’ are connected to so we can remotely check the interfaces when issues arise with the UPS monitoring system. 
 The only information I have about these UPS’ are their IPs and what site they are at. I could possibly get the macs of all the NICs but this would take a lot more time then I would like to spend on this project. 
 Question:
 What is the fastest way to go from “I know this IP is located at this site” to “I know the interface this IP is connected directly to.”

 For some time now we have been experiencing an issue on the network for a while. I haven't been able to figure it out.
 When downloading a large file (usually 500 mb or higher) the download starts strong, then slows down, coming to a complete stop eventually. I've tested this at the router by plugging a laptop directly into our router. The download is fine there. But from the router, it goes downstream to our ASA then to our Core Switch. I tried the download directly out of the Core Switch as well and it seems like the problem starts when I am in the internal part of the network (ASA and downstream). I have been looking into QoS as other engineers have suggested. I am the only Network Engineer and I've been stuck on this problem for a while now. Can anyone please provide some insight to what may be happening on our network?

 Have an issue with merging two Authorization Profile on one AuthZ Policy. I'm using a custom vendor radius attribute. It's 12356 for Fortigate, id 1, named Fortinet-Group-Name. I have created the custom RADIUS Vendor attribute with the " Allow multiple instances of this attribute in a profile " checkbox checked.
 Case 1) If I put multiple instances in 1 Authorization Profile and apply it to a Policy, it works.
 Case 2) If I put more than one Authorization Profile on one AuthZ policy, it does not send more than 1 instance of the attribute. I've tested with 2 profiles where they have one attribute instance each.
 So, the RADUIS attribute seems to allow multiple instances, but the rule will not correctly merge the two AuthZ Profiles that is put on the AuthZ policy.
 The auth report in case1 correctly shows that attributed repeated 2 times as it's supposed to, with two different group names. In case 2 however, the authZ result still matches the two AuthZ Profiles, but in the "results" part in the bottom only 1 radius attribute is shown.
 I'm on ISE 2.7p7. I know there is a new patch, but can't update until next window, and cannot find any resolved caveats in p8 docs to hint that a update would work anyway. Also, I've verified the two cases with pcap.
 Any help appriciated.

 It's a square room.
 Left wall = entire whiteboard
 Front wall = TV screen, windows PC, standard webcam
 Right Wall = nothing
 Back wall = glass and door to leave
 The webcam on the TV can't be turned to see the white board because of the sharp angle. It seems the only solution is to get a camera on the right wall (something with double sided tape or some way to stay near the ceiling and out of sight.
 I tried putting a small tripod with an OSBOT on the center table, but they weren't happy with how it looked.
 https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B08NPGNMV8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
 Any suggestions of a camera I could somehow attach to the wall on the right side? The room is probably 15 feet x 15 feet. The cables will be tricky to pass all the way up there, but something that can have a good angle, possibly a zoom if the whiteboard isn't visible enough.
 We use the free version of discord and other meeting software, they only show 720p so I don't need a fancy 4k solution.
 Thanks for any advice if you guys have gone through this setup.

I spent my first decade working for Cisco and Juniper in Bay Area (California). I was mainly involved in network protocol testing and verification, simulating large customer environments, doing proof of concepts, educating sales engineers, handling escalated customer issues etc. Along with tremendous learning, jobs were financially rewarding as well. However towards the end I started feeling that I am not spending enough time with family. This led me into my second decade of networking job, I joined a mid size organization as a senior network engineer. I have been working for this employer for over 11 years now. The job is very stable and work life balance is great. As you can imagine after working in a same job for such a long time, it can become boring. Although I am at senior level, I still need to do maintenance windows and hardware refreshes which I don't enjoy any more. I am ready to pivot into my third decade of networking and looking for a job change. I intend to work 5-10 years before retiring. During my years at Cisco and Juniper, I worked closely with both Product Managers and Technical Marketing engineers. I think I am going to target one of this role for my future job. What you guys think? My in-depth understanding of networking products along with network automation experience could make a good candidate for TME role. Also my current work experience (running and operating a decent size network) could be a valuable asset to a Product Manager role. I would appreciate if people who have worked as TME or Product Manager can share their experiences. What are pros and cons of each role? From the compensation perspective, are these roles similar? Which one would be a better career path considering I have about 5-10 year left. I appreciate all the responses.

 I need to create a lab environment for each user.
 Users will be able to open a specially created linux machine with novnc and manage it through the browser. By running vulnerable machines in a lab environment, isolated machines and networks must be created for each user.
 If the user wants to scan the vulnerable target machines isolated for him using his own physical computer, he will be able to access it with VPN.
 If he does not want to use VPN and physical computer, he will be able to reach target machines with novnc.
 All they need to do is press a button.
 I tried using proxmox, openvpn, pfsense for this, I tried to create vlans for each user, but I thought it would be inefficient and difficult.
 I am currently researching cloud management software in the style of cloudstack, how do you think I can do this?

 Long story short, spent my 20s trying to impress others rather than pursue my own interests/happiness. Obtained a BSc and PhD in biological sciences but have no intention of pursuing a career in that field.
 Recently enrolled in a 2-year college networking program. Will likely be on a wait list for another year before I can start. Looking to start teaching myself now but would like some direction.
 In your opinion, what are the most important skills for future network engineers? For example, are there particular programming languages that I should become familiar with? What Linux-based environments should I familiarize myself with?
 I am currently starting with the basics. Started a few self-directed networking crash courses on Udemy. Any help is appreciated.

 So our DHCP pool is full pretty often. A lot of users are using laptops. When they connect their laptop to a cable, their WiFi is still connected. Because of this, a lot of users are using two IP addresses while only one is needed.
 I found some solutions. A Powershell script and a GPO policy that makes it so that an established LAN connection will disable the WiFi connection. However, I don't think this cancels the IP Lease that the WiFi connection has. Is there a way to make the WiFi disable AND the leased WiFi IP to be released again?
 The GPO solution would be the best, as we wouldn't have to do this on every pc individually. I found the following policy: Computer Configuration -> Policies ->Administrative Templates -> Network ->Windows Connection Manager > Minimize the number of simultaneous connections to the Internet or a Windows". I am not sure if this also releases the IP-lease of the WiFi connection from the DHCP pool. If not, this wouldn't work as a solution as well.
 I like to add that I am just a helpdesk support Employee. I am guessing a lot of people will say that we shouldn't have LAN and DHCP in the same IP Range. Though you are probably right, I am Sadly not in a position to change this.
 Thanks in advance.

 On an Intel NUC used as a terminal to use RDS a user has a lot of déconnections.
 I ping - t and noticed that TTL alternates between 60 for a while then 251 for a while, again and again. When TTL is 251 connection is lost but ping still responds.
 I made a tracert, worked in 5 hops. I ping -t the five hops (the fifth is the destination) and the first is at TTL 255, the second 254, etc. So the destination is 251 and it makes sense but it always alternates between 251 and 60. In both case, the hop before maintains TTL 252.
 How do I intepretate that? (I'm a young tech sry if the answer is easy)

 Next year I will quit my work as system and network administrator and I plan to travel the world for a year. 
 Does someone know where to find "remote/freelance" job offers or has already experience with this situation. 
 I am still undecided how and whether I want to work at all. On one side I would be happy to have an income to cover my expenses a little. On the other side I dont know if it would limit me too much in my plans.
 I cannot be sure to be always available (internet connection in rural areas all over the world?) and the time differences would also cause problem. Of course, I also want to do and see as much as possible during my trip. To work would also mean a daily loss of time. 
 It is not about the money. I don't necessarily have to work to be able to afford the trip. However, it would be helpful.
 I could imagine working a few hours a day as 1st Level remote support. But I'm not even sure if I should. 
 Do you think it makes sense to look for a job in IT at all, or are other fields of work better suited. For example, as a sales agent. However, I have no experience in this or other sectors. 
 Background:
 Working in IT for more then 10 years. More or less fluent in 3 languages. 
 3 years first and second level support with basic tasks. (mostly onsite computer repairs, helping on user requests with office etc, some network and server administration)
 Afterwards in a small industrial company where my colleagues and I have been responsable for "everything computer related". From Backup, Network, Mailing, Virtualization, Software, Hardware, Printers, Mobile Devices, Security and so on. 
 I would say I have deep knowledge of most areas a normal company uses, so I would not need to much training in something "easy". 
 ​
 But as I already said I am unsure if this would even fit me. 
 Let me hear what you guys think about my thoughts.

Are the two not just different methods by which new users can be created? Admittedly, Dashboard gives you different options through the process, but is it definitively the right way and AD should never be utilised? My 'educator' tells me Dashboard is Microsoft's preferred method and should therefore only ever be used, but I disagree using AD is "wrong", per se.

 We've been targeted by some weirdo for the past 4 days, sending emails to some of our users rambling about nonsense. Problem is he creates new gmail or yahoo addresses every single day to send new stuff. There's nothing really dangerous, no malware or anything else.
 He uses his real name + a series of random numbers + yahoo.com or google.com domain
 At first I blacklisted his first address, and the next day when the second email arrived I made a new mail flow rule to block his name (only part of the addres which has not changed
 The rule is enabled, Enforced, applies if the sender's address contains "hisname" and deletes the mail without notifying anyone. 
 I already had a rule like this for specific commercial addresses which managed to bypass our spam filtering and as far as I can tell those work just fine. 
 Other rules set to look for specific strings seem to work too, stuff like subject contains "BTC wallet" and so on, but not this one for some reason. Any ideas ?

The customer contacted us and our helpdesk opened a TAC case and TAC did a RMA and send the customer a brand new chassi.. 
 To my question: Since the firewalls are active/standy, the customer mentioned that a part of the secondary firewall is active. So some interfaces and routing on the secondary firewall (the standby) is active.

 A third party is going to upgrade a software and they have asked me to upgrade two instances from SQL Server 2012 -> 2019.
 I am not very experienced with MS SQL.
 From what I have seen there are two options:
  
Use the in-house upgrade in the setup.exe for SQL 2019
 Disable the SQL-service, management studio -> backup, install the new instances on 2019 and restore the backups
  
I do however have a couple of questions:
 Is even 1. worth trying? It's very small databases.
 I assume I cannot recreate them with the same names, I have to delete the 2012 before creating the 2019's which leaves me without anything to fall back to?
 Is there anything else I have to keep in mind?
 What is the go-to way to do this as painless and efficient as possible?

 I honest rarely post online, but I would love to hear your thoughts about this as I'm honestly a bit confused and don't know what to do.
 I'm currently transitioning to a new company (corporate), the company has been around for nearly 20 years now. The salary is good, and you know the usual 9-5 job, I decided to give my notice to my current employer to join this company.
 Mid my notice period, a startup company that is funded and supported has offered me a position, the salary is the same as the one I received from company I'm moving into, although the base salary itself is higher by around $500/month, since they don't have the same benefits as that company, they decided to pump my base salary in order to match the offer that I received from the big company.
 Overall, both companies offered me the same salary, although the big company got more now such as bonuses, among other benefits.
 The startup does not have any benefits beside the monthly salary as they are pretty new right now, I asked them about bonuses, and they said its planned but not yet confirmed as they've just started. They also do not provide equity, and they could not provide me with an answer if they plan on giving equity or not.
 I'm honestly pretty confused right now on what to pick, I was gonna pick the startup as I bet it would be more relaxed (in terms of environment not work), but if i'm taking a high risk, what's the high reward exactly if there is no equity provided ?
 Sorry for my bad English, please let me know your thoughts about this :(

In Microsoft Edge version 110, the certificate trust list and the certificate verifier will be decoupled from the host operating system’s root store. Instead, the default certificate trust list and the certificate verifier will be provided by and shipped with the browser.
  
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-cert-verification
 There is a policy to still use the system store, but it is removed within the version 111.
 I don't like it, but I might be wrong. Just wanted to let you know - in case you didn't hear it.
 ​
 Edit: Maybe I misunderstood the information. It is also written:
  
In addition to trusting the built-in roots that ship with Microsoft Edge, the browser will also query the underlying platform for—and trust—locally installed roots that users and/or enterprises installed.
  
I missed that out. Sorry for the inconveniences.

 Primary DNS server kicked the bucket a couple of months back (that was a fun day). I then changed the DHCP server to point clients to use the secondary DNS server as the primary, and use the Sophos UTM as the secondary DNS server. 
 Jump to last week... Sophos UTM gets pulled and replaced with a Fortigate 80F (I am in love). 
 Jump to this week... I am slowly adding Security Profiles to the Fortigate and making sure that Directors can access YouTube Music and the lowly staff are left with only Spotify. Yesterday it all went to shit (always happens when its a WFH day) and I have users bitching that Teams images are not loading, that attachments in Outlook Web are not loading, and that websites need to be refreshed just to get them to load (That last one got told to me this morning... and thats when I threw my fists up in the air and screamed "F U DNS!!!"
 Changed the DHCP settings, threw ipconfig /release and /renew at a couple of clients to test and you bet your android bottom it worked! 
 I am going to now abuse my internet freedom and watch YouTube videos while I cry into my coffee. 
 By the way... if you have not tried Fortigate then you really should!

 Right now, every server in my DMZ is treated as a stand alone (non-domain) server. No LDAP/domain authentication through the firewall. Responsible parties get local accounts on each server they use. As we place more services (& servers) in the DMZ we are starting to struggle to manage them in terms of permissions, accounts, & lack of group policy.
 We're considering setting up a DMZ domain. Allowing trusts with our internal domains (or not). Or even allowing LDAP & needed things through the firewall & adding them to our internal domain (but this doesn't sound smart).
 What are the common ways you guys are tackling this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey people. I have seen posts where people want to learn more about network design and architecture so I thought it would be good to start a discussion around something I'm working on now which involves a design for management of network devices and servers. The network devices are your usual suspects such as switches, routers, firewalls, and so on. I'll just post some of my thoughts and let's get a discussion going.
 Segmentation - Ideally you want to have your management network in a dedicated segment which is not accessible by all users. There are of course many ways of achieving this such as using VRFs or using a firewall. I tend to prefer VRFs as it offers complete logical isolation while a firewall requires the proper ruleset. With that said, even with the use of VRFs you will most l…]]></summary>

 I have recently been tasked with improving the file storage at work and I am not sure how. We are a small business with <10 employees and deal primarily with cad files, excel files, and just pdfs. Currently, we store everything on hard drives( yes, very old fashioned) and this is not working out. Overall, we have around 1tb of data, with the largest files being around 1gb. I would like to be able to store this information in one central place, yet grant different people access to certain folders. Sharing and collaborating on documents isn’t a huge focus, yet would be nice to have. We mostly just need a good storage solution that we can access from any computer. A lot of the things we work with are proprietary so security is important to us. What do you all recommend? I’ve looked into one drive for business And share point, azure files, NAS…

The hiring manager certainly paints a positive picture about Fortinet and professes to be quite bullish on their future. However, before I "drink the kool-aid" I'd love to get off-the-record opinions from people who work for/with Fortinet.
 How do you feel about them, where they currently stand, and their future? Is this a good time for someone to be joining them as an SE?

 I thought I would argue a case for them to get new monitors and I was able to get two Samsung 27 inch monitors for each PC. Got them all hooked up the other day and the users on shift that day really liked the upgrade and even though they now had 2 instead of 3 monitors, the overall monitor space was a bit bigger.
 Well fast forward to today and some on shift today were complaining that now they have to resize windows and all that to get the same things on 2 screens that they had on 3 up at once.
 I found MS PowerToys that lets you set zones on the monitors to have program in. And I was playing around and for the most part yes it did work, but there were 2 programs that our users use that would not let me put into a Fancy Zone (the name of the zones). Is there some sort of hidden restriction on why a window would not go into a fancy zone?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys! Just recently got a new job, doing some higher level infrastructure for a company of 1600 people and 60 locations, with an IT team of 4 (me being the networking guy). I’m just starting to really grasp tunnels, VLANs and trunking concepts in a large company. I’m currently doing network discovery for these locations as they dropped their MSP last month. I worked for a msp previously but we generally supported smaller offices with pretty basic networks without switches, subnets, and VLANs. They use several VLANs across the network at my new job. They’re using fortigates and dell switches primarily. I’m trying to familiar myself with these concepts to help understand the network more.
 Now looking at the static routes on the fortigate firewalls I can see and understand how VLANs and different subnets are communicating. My question is, do you need to setup static routes on a switch with VLANs as well? I’m thinking they would have similar static routes, explaining what IP schemes can communicate over a L3 switch? Or am I overthinking this?
 Thanks for any advice! We’re a small team and sometimes I feel like I have nobody to lean on for questions like this.

 Our business (around 40 people) would like me to implement a ticketing system, preferrably free or low cost.
 One thing they wanted was the ability for them to set their own priority on tickets (lame).
 I imagine I would need a service that provides a webpage for them to create the ticket so they could have that option, rather than sending it to an email.
 Any services like this?
 Edit: I just discovered spiceworks, completely free, allows a user portal with custom attributes so i'm sorted!

The optics themselves were all purchased within the last couple of years and come from multiple vendors-- primarily FS.com, Approved Networks, and knock-off Cisco. Slowly over time they all seem to die at a rate about 1 or 2 a month. One day they're fine, the next day current draw spikes and the TX drops off a cliff. The crazy thing is that I have some modules that have been in service for almost 20 years, and they work just fine.
 Anyone else experiencing this with SX SFP's recently?

The catch is that the lease is still assigned by MAC address, so if a device changes on a remote uni port it wont get a lease until the current one for the old device expires.
 I saw some references from around 2010 that specifying the circuit ID as the primary key for leases was going to be coming "soon". I'm not able to find anything more resent, so I'm assuming it was never actually added, but I'm hoping it's an obscure enough feature that I just don't have the right search terms.

 You can imagine what this has done. Server 2019 will not allow me to run any dedup operations on the volume, garbage collection nor scrubbing.

 I've been grinding on a VPN problem for about a day and I'm running out of steam on this one.
 I have a new Cat9300X stack running IOS-EX 17.9.1r with the HSEC and DNA Advantage license. I'm attempting to create a tunnel to AWS. This is the standard 1-->2 tunnel config where there are two AWS endpoints and one customer gateway. For now, however, I'm only focusing on one tunnel. There will be BGP but that doesn't seem to be relevant to the issue at hand.
 What I've got is a topology that looks like this (basically) [INTERNAL 192.168.X.X VLAN 300]->[9300X]->[VLAN200-169.254.254.1]---[Tunnel2001-169.254.165.178]--[GW FW]----->[AWS VPN Gateway 50.61.72.83]--[TunnelIP-169.254.165.177]
 Phase1 looks great. IKEv2 does it's thing and starts to stand up IPSEC SAs. IPSEC does a propos…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm having difficulties with Vendor configuration files for EC120-F5, EC220-G5 and EC230-G1.
 After creating a Config file and uploading it to a new router via AginetACS, the new router gets same SSID and PIN as the device I've created the config with.
 I've read the Aginet Config Operation Manual but could not find a solution.
 Tried setting the password to "?undefined?" in General config and the SSID as "Name_XXXX_2G" (XXXX should be replaced with last symbols of each device's MAC address, 6.2 - 6.3 in the manual). Tried uploading config straight from the router I've created it with and from Aginet Config Server. No luck. 
 Can anybody please help with some information on how to properly create the Vendor Configutarion Files, including Account Permission Settings and custom SSID with specific router's PIN as wireless key, that fits any newly connected router to network? 
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got two cisco 3850 connecting two datacenters. Fiber work was scheduled for the direct connection between them so the interfaces were shut down preemptively forcing traffic the long way around on our redundant (lower bandwidth) path.
 After the work was done, i "no shut: the interfaces. The interfaces lit up, but only one side could see the neighbor. Not able to ping eachother.
 The interfaces are trunks with the native vlan interface IP'd for routing protocols.
 For kicks i issued no switchport and moved the IPs to the interfaces and they came back up and are able to ping eachother.
 So somehow this issue is related to layer 2/vlans. Any ideas?
 fixed ---
 I bounced the side that was not seeing the neighbor, and everything came back up normal. Something must have flaked in that switch when i shut down those interfaces. I checked to make sure that they were in agreement as far as root bridges for vlans, but since the native vlan wasn't coming up, both thought they were the root bridge. I'm assuming that is normal under the circumstances as they could not communicate, but the whole thing is really weird. I would've really liked to have found out what was causing the issue.
 Thanks for all the suggestions, folks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all-
 As subject says; we have bad address entries in our DHCP pool. Some background:
 2 dhcp servers with failover pools (Windows Server 2022)
 Have a Cisco 4500X for layer 3 routing. This switch has dhcp helper information for each vlan
 Now, the oddities:
 -I can't find any other dhcp server on our network of any kind, in any of the vlans
 -Only certain wired vlans are affected; the data vlans for end user PC's. Our wireless, phone, security camera, clock and management vlans are unaffected.
 -We don't exhaust the pool; we will get a random number of bad address entries, usually about a third of the amount of wired desktop PC's
 -I have set the DHCP lease time to 6 hours, which results in much fewer bad address entries. If I bump it up to 2-3 days or more, I will have double or triple the amount of entries.
 ​
 I'm suspecting it might be some of our Dell desktops (optiplex 3060, Win 10 and 11 Enterprise for clients) that is the issue; in the 5 vlans affected, all of the desktops are the same model Dell. For the life of me, however, I'm not sure why this might be an issue. I have sort of a working theory, but have not tested it out yet; the desktops go to sleep at the end of the day; then are woke up by employees the next morning. They try to get their prior address, but it is listed in the scope, so they get another. 
 Anyone else ever have something similar?
 Thanks all!

These paths are tunneled between 2 routers and when the primary router tunnel goes down it takes the firewall anywhere between 30 secs to a 1:30 before switching to the alternate route. Is there anyway I can configure the asa to drop and switch routes quicker? Please let me know if I need to provide more information. Thank you!

Just this team. I unplug the port 49 and it happens again. They all lose connection for a moment then back to network connection...Wtf?
 I've ssh'd into the both of the switches. The new one has a Mac address table with nothing plugged in. Just noticed the the new switch duplicated the 130 macs from the other switch.
 What the f$%k gives? Confused.

 On Monday my business had some sort of power event that caused our firewall, main switch (hp-2510-48), phone system and one of our active directory/dns servers to power cycle before coming back online. After that in a seemingly random pattern, various end point devices can no longer connect to the network, and for those devices that can, the network latency is through the roof.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/networking, 
 I'm relatively new to networking and have a weird circumstance that I'm not sure how to tackle. 
 I connect manufacturing equipment to our client's WAN on a regular basis. Our manufacturing equipement has an internal LAN with the IP scheme, 192.168.100.XXX, and I use a router to NAT to static IPs on our client's network that they provide. 
 It's usually smooth sailing, I configure the router to the dedicated IPs the client provides and we're good to go. 
 My trouble is my client's WAN is 192.168.100.XXX as well. So NATing would be pointless and I cannot reserve all of IPs of my machine on their network. 
 Would there be a good way to not create conflict? My initial thought is to use a VLAN so my equipment's LAN sees the VLAN and their WAN sees the VLAN and neither ever sees each other, I don't actually know if this is possible or the best course of action. Any guidance is much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 ​
  
What I am doing:
  
Testing platform to see disruptions and to check to see if my software can detect these.
 I am sending packets from a IP to a multicast address then to another IP.
 For example: (#1 IP)192.168.1.1 sends it to (#2 Multi)235.1.200.1 and then it goes to (#3 IP)192.168.1.15.
 I am on a external computer (Connected to same network switch). I have been trying to spoof the #1 and 2 IPs. So that the messages goes from #1 to (ME #4) then to the #2 Multi then #4.
 It doesn't really matter the order as long as I can see a loss, delay effect on either end of the network.
 ​
  
What I need:
  
I need a way to intercept and control the flow of these packets. I need to represent a loss of packets, and delay the time which the packets send at.
 ​
  
Things I have tried:
  
I have been using Ettercap and TC Qdisc to try and make this work. I can receive the packets with Ettercap, but when I try and use TC Qdisc it doesn't have any effect.
 I originally tested just going from IP1 to IP2 and used Ettercap to spoof these ips. I then used TC Qdisc to control the loss packets, delay, duplicate, and corruption of these packets and it Does work.
 ​
 In my original test without multicast you would see this on wireshark:
 192.168.1.1 >> 192.168.1.15
 192.168.1.15 >> 192.168.1.1
 ​
 With multicast you would see this on wireshark:
 192.168.1.1 >> 235.1.200.1
 192.168.1.15 >> 235.1.200.1
 I tired getting between the host and multi and tried applying the effects there but no luck. 
 192.168.1.15 >> (ME TC QDISC HOST) >> 235.1.200.1
 ​
  
Question to you:
  
What are my options here. If you have experience with this feel free to share your approach.
 Is there another way to go about this? If so please let me know.

But when I stop the lab and start it back up at a later time I just get a blank screen on the console of the cEdges. My template changes are still deployed and I'm able to pass traffic, so they're still working. It's just console access that's broken. Tried it on a bunch of different labs running different code and same thing happens on all of them. Any ideas on why I can't console in after a restart?

 I have heard that Azure has a cloud update service that can be used to patch on premises servers, but we don’t want most of our servers to have any internet access.
 Is there a method to just give individual servers internet access as a proxy for all the other servers at that site (like you would do with a WSUS server) and then use delivery optimization or branch cache at each site to distribute the updates internally rather than allowing every server to be able to access the internet?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone. I was looking for some opinions here. I searched for other posts similar to my situation, but I wanted to get some advice since many posts were a few years old.
 We could have better backup storage at my company. Currently, we have two sets of external drives attached to our backup system onsite, sitting in the same room on top of each other. Each set of drives hosts an independent copy of all of our backups. We are also copying a set of these backups into Azure.
 I was permitted to look into upgrading these off-brand external drive enclosures into a rack-mounted solution for Site A and then putting an offsite backup into Site B. I got a quote for a Synology system, but the fact that they're forcing you to use their branded drives doesn't sit well with us. Additionally, it would be about $10-12k for one of these systems - which was more than they wanted to spend on two systems.
 As I was thinking of alternatives, I remembered we have two SuperMicro servers (that we used to use as Hyper-V servers) that aren't being used, each having 16x drive bays in them. Both have 256GB of RAM and plenty of processing power, even though they're ~8 years old. I was thinking of loading TrueNAS Core onto these servers, loading up the bays with storage, using these as our physical backups at sites A and B, and then still copying a set into Azure. I have never used TrueNAS before, but I think it would accomplish what we need. I can also get some 18TB Iron Wolf Pro drives for $300/ea - so ultimately, the cost of this buildout would be the cost of the drives.
 Would you have any thoughts on this setup? Pros/cons? Alternatives I should look at? Our total footprint is 50TB, but we're currently not doing Client Backups or O365 Backups, so that will be my next project - so I need room to expand.
 I appreciate any opinions.
 Thanks in advance!

 On new laptops with Intel Graphics, there is an option called Power Savings Technology. It drives me insane as it is always adjusting the brightness and contrast of the display. 
 I know where to turn it off inside the Intel Graphics Command Centre, but does anyone have any experiencing automating the disabling of this option? I want it off for all laptops and I can’t trust those that deploy laptops to adjust this manually. 
 The guides and suggestions online don’t seem to work for me, ie the registry keys advised don’t exist. 
 Does anyone have any experience with this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context:
 We use GSuite for emails, HP M575/577/578 MFPs for our printing and scanning needs. We have our own domain, take it as xx.com
 We have a specific account made for scan-to-email functions, xx.scanner@xx.com
 We have over 20 printers working properly with said account, sending emails of scans properly.
 A few weeks ago, we got 2 new HP M578 MFPs, so we started configuring them for use. Configurations we're 1:1d from older printers, together with network settings according to company policy.
 Using smtp.gmail.com, port 587, TLS enabled. All tests pass, account validates, test email arrives.
 Test with an actual document (300kb in scan size according to other machines) - Nothing
 Test with a blank page - Arrives
 Test with a very basic text document - Arrives - Size is around 30kb
 This is where the weird part comes in, seems like the document size limit is 30kb for some reason. No other printers are experiencing this besides those two. Firmware versions etc all match.
 I tried different DNS settings etc as this was sometimes reported to be the issue, nothing.
 I also read about app passwords, but some places argue that that it isn't needed for Google Workspace/Gsuite accounts and we still have no issues with the account on our older printers.
 Has anyone run into this before and has any recommendations on what else we could try?

 I am working quite some time now to a really nice company that offers a lot flexibility including a lot remote working and although the management would like more of us to be more often to office most people for various reasons (some are living on other cities) are ignoring it.
 This month though there was more pressure like our manager of our team asked us to choose TWO days per month that as a team will be gathering on the office and i see they are trying to establish it especially from January of the next year.
 Thats not a problem for me and its nice to see other members of the team that i dont see often , however i'd like to have the choice especially for summers that i travel a lot to my home country etc to be able to stay longer without having to be in office for just for the sake of being in office.
 So far i have to visit the office maybe even 6 months LOL
 I feel that like a step back in terms of freedom and i am afraid if they get ideas to start asking more days per month...
 I was thinking if there are ways that still i can keep avoiding the presence in office...Like just not comply fully as many other have done in various situations?
 Like maybe attend at first a few times in office but then just only attend one per month or having excuses for not being in office ?bring up health issues or anything ?

 They all run:
 Current ASA version = 9.8(4)10

 ASA latest verion = 9.14.4
 ASDM latest version = 7.19.1
 ​
 But what about the FXOS version - do i need to upgrade that ?
 I'm having trouble finding a clear explanation as Cisco documentation invariably points to firepower devices.
 ​
 That said i discovered the document below. 
 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/upgrade/asa-upgrade/asa-appliance-asav.html#topic_r5l_tt5_bbb
 ​
 Just to confirm i do not have a physical firepower module in any of the ASA devices.
 ​
 Is there a software file I need to download for the FXOS ?
 ​
 Any help much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, my college got hit my Lorenz ransomware. It's been a fun week. As i'm sure many of you know, schools dont have the biggest IT budgets so we're responding with a bare bones team.
 We have an on-prem Exchange with an Exch relay and AD sync server - i think with bidirectional sync - to our o365 tenant. 
 We have brought back our servers from backups, but havent placed the AD sync server back in prod yet because we were told that Lorenz ransomware sometimes exfiltrate your mailboxes after a ransomware incident by scraping mailboxes after reconnecting AD sync. 
 Do you have any idea how i should approach this?
 I was thinking:
 1) Use global admin in o365 to review any suspicious accounts, privileged accounts etc and identify ones which need a password reset (board isnt letting me do a ful pw global reset :/ ) 
 2) go onto on prem domain controller and do an AD review there for suspicious accounts etc
 3) when both o365 and on prem AD have been reviewed, put the AD sync back into prod but with active sync disabled
 4) then when the server appears to be working, re-enable activesync
 Is there something i'm missing?

Disk management shows the correct size and one huge NTFS schema. Then i connect the HDD to an Ubuntu Client to transfer some data. Ubuntu can mount NTFS and i can copy/edit my data. After moving 400gb to the client i disconnect and put the hdd back into the other docking station at my windows client. Now NTFS seems to be gone and i see 2 non allocated parts with discmanager. 1. 2048GB 2. 1678.02GB
 I guess something on the Ubuntu client isn't liking NTFS and erase/change my partition table?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve worked quite a bit with on-prem and Azure setups but am currently planning my first Hybrid rollout. Trying to find a number on how long a device can go without having line of sight to the internal network/DC. 
 With 140ish users we have one, maybe two devices that will spend more than a day at a time away from the office (up to a month I’m told is the max) so we would like to avoid the complexities of configuring Intune and having different management protocols for these two devices but want to make sure how long they can go without checking in. They will still have internet connectivity so they are able to check in with Azure but not the internal network in our current plan. 
 Any advice is appreciated, I can’t find anything about this online and want to make sure we have everything in order before we get too deep in this project.
 Edit for clarification: right this moment these users are using local users and manually copying/emailing any files that need saved in company file shares, etc. We are working to make sure all devices are managed and users and company data are both controlled while having access to company resources when on the road.

 What I feel I would benefit mostly from:
 -How to deploy an easy to maintain application (git, jenkins, docker), general devops stuff. I know how to use these tools in a rudimentary fashion, but I feel I don't know how to put them all together.
 -Popular Python network automation libraries (netmiko, nornir, napalm).
 I already have access to O'reilly's library and Linkedin Learning.
 I've looked at INE but they don't have anything in the area of automation, CBT nuggets looks promising - I'm going to try their 7 day trial. ipspace.net's Individual standard subscription also looks promising.
 What trainings in this area did you have a good experience with and you would recommend?

 We have a group policy issue with our accounts. After performing the recent Cumulative Update for Win10 21H2, the user group policy is not applying. This previously worked.
 We did have RM (UK educational network software vendor) remote in and tell us some GPO changes we made were in the wrong place (GPM, rather than RMMC, the RM management software), but i'm unsure if their changes have affected it. (though i'm sure it worked before they remoted in). RM themselves are as stumped as we are.
 Inheritance looks OK, the GPOs have the right settings, but for some reason, it's just not picking up the user GPO. The affected accounts largely seem to be legacy Roaming Profile accounts that have been converted to UEV.
 Anything i could have missed? Could there be legacy cruft affecting it? Anyone experienced the same sort of issues?
 If this is the wrong place for these sort of questions, ping me and i'll move it :)

 Can someone please help me:
 Simple Network architecture:
 https://imgur.com/a/xYzEAOU
 Cloud management subnet is 192.168.222.0 with a mask of 255.255.255.0 and the Gateway IP is 192.168.222.1 which also runs a DHCP server:
 On the eve-ng host:
 root@eve-ng:~# route
 Kernel IP routing table
 Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
 default pfsense.skubsad 0.0.0.0UG 0 0 0 pnet0
 192.168.222.0 0.0.0.0255.255.255.0 U 0 0 0 pnet0
 ​
 Steps to reproduce:
  
​ 
 Add a new Cloud Network on the topology with network type set to Management(Cloud0).
 
 2. Add a new Virtual PC (VPC) to the topology
 3. Connect VPC to Management Cloud. Start the VPC
  
Expected behavior:
 The Interface connected to Cloud 0 on the VPC should get a DHCP assignment from upstream DHCP server (1922.168.222.1).
 Observed behavior:
 No DHCP assignment on VPC interface connected to Cloud 0. However, after static assignment, I'm able to ping upstream DHCP server (192.168.222.1).
 Question:
  
Why no DHCP assignment on VPC interface connected to Cloud 0?
 After static assignment, I am able to ping the DHCP server 192.168.222.1, but it does not pick up DHCP by itself?
  
​
 Thank you in advance
 Best Regards

 I have a Sophos SG115 that I've just freshly configured and would like to connect a Sophos APX120 to the UTM but I can't seem to get it working. I'm pretty new to Sophos, and firewalls in general, so I'm sure I'm missing something super basic. 
 As it is right now, I have the wireless AP connected to a PoE injector, and then connected to the LAN port of the SG115. The AP turns on and boots fine, but gets stuck on a flashing amber light, which according to the manual means the AP is not claimed by the wireless controller. I'm wondering if maybe I need to create a new DHCP server on the UTM? When I check the IPv4 Lease Table there's nothing listed, so it's clearly not picking up that the AP is connected. Or at least not assigning an IP via DHCP. 
 If anyone has any experience with this and had some tips or guidance it would be super appreciated. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on a Hyper-V configuration where I need to pass multiple VLANs on the same network interface (tagged sub-interfaces).
 Within the VMWare world, this is easy. A Port group assigned to VLAN 4095.
 Within Hyper-V, I used the Powershell command:
 Set-VMNetworkAdapterVlan -VMName "VM-Name" -VMNetworkAdapterName "DATA" -NativeVlanId 0 -AllowedVlanIdList 1-4094 -trunk 
 Per my understanding, that puts the NIC into "Trunk" mode, allows all VLANs, and doesn't allow a Native VLAN (so only tagged traffic will flow) - I also tried native to 1.
 Unfortunately, from a PCAP it looks like Hyper-V is stripping the 802.1q tag from the frames. So I am seeing traffic from all of the different VLANs - but without their tags. That's not going to work...
 Is there something else that needs to be defined for Hyper-V to pass the tags not just the payload?

 I need to take the server off the current domain and move it to a totally different domain.
 I have Bitlocker recovery keys and will generate fresh ones before doing this but is there anything I need to consider when I do this?
 The option to allow TPM was set using GPO and when it's taken off this domain that GPO won't apply but the drives are already encrypted.
 I'm not 100% sure what the behavior will be when it restarts off the existing domain and I don't have a spare physical server to try this on.
 If I have to enter the recovery key that's OK so long as the volumes unlock :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 While not actually a blank slate, we are currently full embedded into SCCM. We are having plenty of difficulties patching third party applications and don't have the man power to keep packaging apps.
 While we looked and trialed PatchMyPC and worked really well, a subsidiary of ours isn't using MECM and has all their devices enrolled into Intune/Endpoint Manager. This was fine, until we went to enroll the terminal servers, which at that point realised Microsoft doesn't support Endpoint Manager for MS Server.
 So now we are looking at RMM tools to help us with, application deployment and patching. I have come across a number of tools, and NinjaOne seems to be on top. But their pre-sales are frustrating and constantly want me to do a demo session with their techs instead of just giving me a price on the 2500 devices I want to cover.
 I checked out Gartner, but it doesn't do quadrants for this in particular, more so unified desktop management which brings MS Endpoint Manager to the top.
 If anyone could chime in on if you had a blank slate, what would you do? Also the business will not touch SolarWinds with a 10ft pole because of the scandal last year/year before and I have heard mixed reviews on ManageEngine's Desktop Central.

 It's.. Incredible at what it does. I asked it, to spin up a series of nodes in AWS with IAC, running one of the applications I support, and also implement DR for those nodes. And within seconds, I had a workable script that did exactly what I had asked it to do. 
 I've run it against a bunch of different scenarios and overall it seems more competent at coding than about 90% of the people I've worked with, myself included.
 Even vaguely querying errors returns answers better than what you'd typically receive from any vendor support over the course of days, in seconds.
 So what are the implications here - where does everyone see the field going? I honestly didn't think we'd get to this point for another several years, minimum. I'm starting to think I might need to re-skill and move over to pure development just to stay afloat in the next few years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All,
 I am a field engineer for a large MSP. We have never had any good imaging processes. On the day to day pc replacement, we just use the dell default image, go through the oobe and install everything by hand in-person, then manage the rest with our RMM. For a re-image, we just use the media creation tool image and once again go through the oobe, join domain, install software. 
 For large scale replacements, (When win7 went EOL) we had a process where we would upgrade the PC to win10, and then use Macrium reflect to clone the PC onto a brand new PC. This was relatively quick and effective at the time, however over the last 2 years we have had constant issues with a lot of the cloned machines and ended up re-imaging most one by one. 
 I have been asking management to start doing the Dell Image Assist, where we get them from dell mostly pre-imaged, but they decline every time. 
 Well, now, one of our larger clients just had 150 new Pc's delivered, that they need installed, and the ticket has been just dropped onto me to get it done. This would require me to unbox, complete the oobe, rename the PC, join it to the domain, install chrome, adobe reader, office 365, and their specialized software. And then on a per user basis install their respective printers, scanners, other devices. 
 Anyone have any ideas on the fastest way to get these PC's deployed? Sysprep drive duplicating? Creating 1 image and then sysprepping and then trying to clone it out to the rest of them?

This information could be represented as a 1 bit value instead, freeing up 3 bits from every packet traversing the internet. Is there a reason IPv6 did not change this field to be shorter? It seems like freeing up 3 bits of data from this field would yield global improvements in internet efficiency.
 Now look, I realize that there's always smarter people who have thought of something first. So I understand there are likely good reasons for this ineffienct header value. I'm wondering if anyone could tell me why things are set up the way they are.

 Is netbox free ? Would it work in a large enterprise environment? Does netbox have support ? Is there a sale rep that I can communicate with ? 
 I tried googling but not much information out there regarding netbox. Any help would be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 I recently took on a new job as a systems engineer, tasked with discovery and replacing equipment in a 1600 person company, across 60 locations, (6 main locations). One of the locations has three Dell N2000 stacks in different parts of the building. I'm not too savvy with switches, or VLANs for that matter, but I'm learning. I'm understanding these concepts more and more every day and how they're applied to this network. I'm currently doing discovery on this building, but I have no GUI/Web interface to log into for two of the three stacks.
 The MDF has no issues. I'm able to log into that via IP address no problem.
 I'm having issues getting into the other IDF stacks. I'm able to putty into them using SSH no problem. Credentials take which is a great sign. But I'm still very green to all of this here, and looking at everything visually is way easier for me then CLI, especially when I'm trying to map out these VLANS and trunked ports, etc.
 Is there anything I need to do to get onto these other stack's GUI? I'm confused as to why just one stack is accessible through GUI, and the others are not.
 Looking for some help on this or pointers! What am I missing here!

 I have tried using an SFP cable to hook the two up, and two different SFP+ cables, one copper, one fiber. With all the cables, I tried port speed auto-negotiation and manually setting it to 2.5g, but the unifi switch cannot detect this 2.5g switch. Any way to link an SFP to an SFP+ port?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I seem to be getting conflicting information on how the IPsec protocol itself handles multiple subnets in a tunnel. I know different vendors have slightly different approaches to this, but I'm more concerned with what's actually possible in the protocol. I've heard the following so far:
  
Multiple subnets are agreed upon in phase 2, all in a single tunnel.
 Multiple phase 2 "tunnels" are created, one for each subnet pair.
 You can't do more than one subnet pair in the IPsec protocol. Therefore, multiple phase 1 tunnels are created, one for each subnet pair.
  
I think the 2nd answer is correct, but I can't seem to find any detailed information from an authority on it without diving deep into the RFC's.
 FWIW, I know it's possible to just make a big 0.0.0.0/0 tunnel and deal with the routing myself, but I'm trying to help a vendor troubleshoot their own stuff on a failover tunnel between us and them. The status on my side shows that in a failover event, only one of the subnet pairs is re-created.
 Edit: I'm now leaning towards the 1st answer because of the below link. It seems that you can have multiple traffic selectors. Some vendors just "show" this information as multiple phase 2 tunnels? But their terminology isn't necessarily accurate, and everything was only negotiated once in phase 2?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm currently trying to help our subsidiary company with installing a new Cisco Meraki firewall.
 Up until this point they have had little to no security built into their firewall. Their old one was basically an allow all rule that configures the firewall like a router. I've told them multiple times this is not acceptable. 
 Long story short I configured the firewall for them, but it did cause some things to break. (I don't actually work in their environment so its hard for me to know everything that goes on) 
 Their environment is somewhat complex as they have multiple vpns belonging to clients. Also obviously clients don't give out all the security details of their programs so its been tough sledding to this point.
 My question is is what would you do if you were in my shoes? Is it not possible to block a lot of ports due to the size of the company? I've only worked at smaller companies so blocking multiple ports has never been an issue.
 I've read about doing network scans for 24 hours and then analyzing this data. The problem is at this point it is hard to differentiate friend from foe as everything is being let in.
 Any advice or anything really would be of major help.
 ​
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am having an issue with static IP's and configuring protection against ARP spoofing on a pretty basic switch ( HPE 1920-48G-PoE+). This switch refers to it as ARP Anti-Attack which is where I configured my trusted ports to other switches and configured it to be enabled on VLAN 1. I have already configured DHCP snooping and everything works as expected as long as a device is using DHCP.
 Now, my issue is with some devices that are using a static IP addresses outside of the DHCP range. My understanding is I should be able to add a static ARP entry in the table for the IP and mac address but for whatever reason it still does not work.
 So my question is:
  
What is the proper way to deal with static IP's when enabling ARP Spoofing? I know I can use DHCP reservations but I want to know how to handle this without DHCP.
 If putting static entries in the ARP table is the solution to handling static IPs, what could be causing my issue with this switch?

 We are 15% Win11 now for our pilot ring, and all new deployments are Win11. No issues save one - an old VPN software from the state. No user or IT complaints so far. Some of our data is under federal regulation and cannot be on unpatched or unsupported systems so being on an unsupported OS is not an option. We have other systems and unregulated data on very old software written for Win XP that has no trouble running on Win11.
 To minimize IT support and troubleshooting and dual documentation for end users, I am hoping to make the transition quickly. Aiming for 100% in the next 12 months, but I suspect that like most of my deadlines that will slip.
 Are you testing Windows 11? What is your timeline for upgrading? Any issues?

This is the first time I’ve taken time off in my new role and after 4 days I actually miss the job. Been here for about 9 months now and I can honestly say that this is where I want to work for the foreseeable future. The MSP I work for does it all right and ticks all the boxes. Good salary comp for the kind of work I do, social, perks and benefits, company culture, work life balance, useful teammates, you name it. Sure we get dickhead users and silly requests like everyone does, but somehow the way the company manages all of this make this a non-issue.
 All that corporate mumbo jumbo about culture, all the Richard Branson quotes, the LinkedIn posts that talk about stuff - this place actually does all of that, for real, and no one waffles on about it. A recruiter emailed me the other day offering an interview for a position with better working times and 25% better pay and I replies saying not interested before I read the full spec. 
 I don’t have a motivational quote or a moral lesson to finish off on, just felt like sharing. I guess what I want to say is that these places to exist, it just feels surreal.

They are connected to each user network and scan them using an old Linux application that doesn't appear to be in use anymore. Just curious about what everyone else is doing in this day and age.

The book takes a top-down approach through the protocol stack, but it does not really deal with the physical layer. In fact, as it finishes up the link layer, the book explicitly states:
  
Certainly, the physical layer lies below the link layer, but the details of the physical layer are probably best left for another course (for example, in communication theory, rather than computer networking).
  
I'd be interested in knowing more. Does anyone have any reference recommendations to continue my journey?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ill start by saying that I am do not have my CCNA. Actually, I don't have much experience with Cisco at all.
 Im an IT guy for a small company. The current Cisco 3850 switch is severely outdated and we just purchased a new 9300.
 Since I dont have a lot of Cisco experience, I was using the 9300 to go over some CCNA labs before installing this in production. I made some errors and ended up factory resetting the switch.
 Now, Im getting bootable url's in boot variable not found or exhausted
 please check the rommon configuration or boot command usage.
 ​
 I downloaded the image from Cisco's site, installed and can get back into the webui and run commands and everything seems fine, until I reboot the switch. After rebooting, it get the "bootable url in boot variable not found" message again.I made sure to save my configuration settings before restarting.
 Ive been Googling this for a day and its driving me insane, but Im sure its something stupid that Im missing.
 Any help would be very greatly appreciated!
 ​
 ​
 Edit: If I boot from the USB drive with the image on it, I am able to get to all of my settings. I can take the USB out and get to my webui and all my configurations appear to be there, but if I dont reboot it with the USB, then I get the "bootable url" error.
 It almost seems like maybe the image isnt saved to the switch
 ​

 Edit 2: RESOLVED. Resolution in comments!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I may have screwed up a bit and need some help. Our IS team ran a Purple Knight scan against our AD environment to look for potential configuration issues. One thing they found was a high number of users that had adminCount set to 1. Their recommendation was to clear the adminCount for all standard users and see how many of them return to an adminCount of 1 the next time SDPROP runs and review the list at that time.
 I inadvertently cleared the adminCount for ALL AD objects instead of just the standard user objects. In other words, the builtin groups that are supposed to be protected were also cleared. When I realized this, I set the adminCount for those groups and 2 users (administrator and krbtgt) to adminCount=1.
 Admittedly, my understanding of how SDPROP works could be way off but my expectation would be that when SDPROP runs, any users of those protected groups should have thier adminCount set to 1, inheritance disabled and their ACL replaced with the same permissions as what are on the AdminSDHolder object.
 However nothing is getting the adminCount set back to 1, not even domain admin group members. I don't know how to check to make sure that SDPROP is running or not. I checked the PDC for the registry entry that controls the SDPROP frequency (HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NTDS\Parameters\AdminSDProtectFrequency) and it doesn't exist so it should be running every hour by default. I even tried triggering SDPROP manually.
 Any ideas of what I could check next or what I might be missing? Do I need to set adminCount=1 on the AdminSDHolder object?

 Im trying to understand what the difference is between the Cisco ASA vs FPR vs FTD. 
 When reading documentation, ASA is replaced by the NGFW: Firepower. The ASA lacked for example IPS and had a basic software. The FPR can now provide URL filtering, application control etc.. 
 But.. how is the FPR managed compared to the ASA? Do you managed it via CLI or GUI (or both)? What more differences are there between these two more than the above stated? I also read about the FTD, what does this exactly do? It seems to me that FTD is a software, but what does it run on?
 I probably mix all of these but I would like some clarification.

 We currently do and experience sound/video quality problems that are bad enough to annoy the users.
 As we would rather like to continue to have all internet traffic go through a proxy we consider trying a SOCKS proxy. So, does anyone have experience with Webex through a SOCKS proxy? Does it help to mitigate latency problems?
 If yes, how do you redirect the UDP data stream to the SOCKS proxy? We use PAC scripts to redirect traffic depending on URL but that doesn't help to sort the UDP and TCP traffic to their respective proxy.

My company appears to use Jamf as its Mac MDM and I haven’t fully explored to see if there are any keyloggers/spyware installed etc. However, I was just wondering what the risks are with adding my personal Apple ID to my work machine? It’s worth noting that I don’t intend to check any of the boxes in the iCloud system preference page; this would purely be for handoff features and the like and I wouldn’t synchronise any services such as iMessage, photos, iCloud Drive etc (although maybe private relay could be useful). As far as I know, to get features like universal control and unlock with Apple Watch to work you need to have both an iPad and a MacBook on the same primary Apple ID as even things like notes and reminders don’t work with a secondary Apple ID.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What would you guys do in this situation?
 We are located in a secure facility that requires background checks for all vendors. We also have a contract with Canon copiers to service them whenever they break down or need replacing. We have a copier that is broken but our facility won't let the techs in without the background check. Canon is not being cooperative in allowing their techs to complete the BG check. I believe the techs may not even have social security numbers which is holding things up. The facility won't let the techs enter in without the clearance.
 I (on-site help desk) will be out starting next week for the holidays.
 I have a few options I can think of:
  
Short term, wait until tech gets cleared, but they haven't been responsive
 Bring copier outside the facility and somehow tech can service it out on the street? This seems counter intuitive and hard to do.
 Get tools from Canon directly and fix myself?
 long term, get a smaller copier (that IT can fix) not on a contract and/or eliminate the contract with canon.
 Resign my position as the facility is preventing me from doing my job which is to coordinate these things

 But an article updated in the last 2 months still says "allows Microsoft 365 partner admins the ability to administer all the tenants they manage from a single location" - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/multi-tenant/manage?view=o365-worldwidehttps://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/admin/multi-tenant/manage?view=o365-worldwide
 To clarify, Azure AD Admin multi-org through B2B is working fine , but really need the access on the 365 Admin. I currently cannot get the Organization Switcher to show anywhere (outside of Azure AD Admin).

I'm trying to create onboarding and offboarding procedures (that keep changing all the time due to changes we are currently making to our system). I am trying to learn some code and create a database and other applications, which I'm sure you all know takes time too. So when my report is due, it literally has like 3-4 things on it. I also put out all the small fires or things employees need throughout the week too. Any suggestion how I can make this thing look more productive?

 Reason for this is that we are using TAP, which outputs TX/TX. Each of the TX are connected to their own separated GBIC on the Cisco 2960x. TX port on the gbic stays unplugged. This setup works on older Cisco 2960g, and port comes up even with the TX port unplugged. However, on Cisco 2960x it doesnt work and port doesnt come up.
 Is there some configuration option to setup sfp port to go up when only RX is connected?

In order to fix User profile there is a ways to do so like using Regedit and I have done it in the past, but I can't get to recovery CMD or safe mode because of bitlocker asking to enter key to unlock the drive. Plus, recovery key is not present in Microsoft account. Does any solution exist for this?

 I have a situation where we're moving people across to azure only managed devices and that means their accounts don't need to be domain joined anymore, as the only thing requiring domain authentication was the old domain joined computer log in screen.
 Initially we were moving the accounts to an unsynced organisational unit and then re-enabling the deleted accounts in azure to break the link, but we found that this had the side effect of removing their private channels on teams due to teams channels not being managed via an assigned group.
 Is there any way to pause adsync, move the on-prem account to the disabled OU, then just set the accounts on-prem sync to false on an individual account basis?

 I've yet to find any way of preventing those keys to be created, my google-fu must not be up to scratch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello !
 ​
 First of all, sorry if i make gramatical/technical mistakes, English is not my first language.
 So, recently, my company started to use Azure AD for using Office 365 with a federated Domain. We set a SSO with Shibboleth linked to our main domain. Then, if a user try to connect to the domain, it redirect them on the CAS page, and if they're already connected, allow the authentication. This was done with our network engineers, actually in charge of the OpenLDAP (one of the domain is on Samba 4 and the other only have and LDAP and no samba)
 ​
 Since then, we though of some amelioration and I was trying to log in windows with work account (so an account present in the azure A.D). It works for the account in managed domain, but doesn't for the federated domain.
 ​
 I know it's logical since the Windows authentication can't redirect them to our CAS, but I read online that some people can login with federated domain username and password. My question is, how ?
 ​
 I believe the main mistake was during the first implementation of the SSO with the command Set-MsolDomainAuthentication. We used the command as :
 Set-MsolDomainAuthentication -DomainName $OurDomain -federationBrandName $FederationBrandName -LogOffUri $LogoutUrl -Authentication Federated -PassiveLogOnUri $LogonURI -SigningCertificate $certData -IssuerUri $uuri -PreferredAuthenticationProtocol SAMLP 
 We didn't use "ActiveLogonUri", but I'm not sure if this is usefull, nor really sure about what that property can do. Still, this command work for the web-based applications but obviously not for Windows authentication 
 Is this the problem or am I completly out of place ? Do you have any idea about the origin, or a solution ?

 I was thinking of using just two AC or U6 pro APs in "standalone mode" and connecting them to a router & switch I already have. Pretty much a "dumb access point"
 Is it worth it to get Unifi access points for this or are there cheaper alternatives that would do the same (since you do pay a premium to have everything "just work" with ubiquity" Any suggestions are appreciated!

 Have a quick question regarding the above. 
 We have SPF enabled for just spf.protection.outlook.com and that’s sufficient enough I believe. So only things sent from M365 will allow outbound mail. 
 DKIM is setup via DNS and our 365 admin centre. And this seems fine. 
 But here’s where I’m a bit confused. We have dmarc enabled and it was set to quarantine. So all mail that fails SPF and DKIM will go into spam? Is this for inbound or outbound mail? I thought DMARC was for outbound, but a 3rd party trying to email us, got an error showing DNS Auth: DMARC failed.
 Is this an issue on our end?

 I am planning to replace existing hostname by making simple interactive script
 #!/bin/bash echo "Set Hostname" read name1 name='cat /proc/sys/kernel/hostname' sed -i 's/$name/$name1/g' /etc/hostname hostname $name1 
 The issue here is - it changes hostname after I set input after script run. I exit and log back in. I see new hostname. But nothing gets changed in /etc/hostname file. reboot and I am back to old hostname.
 What am I missing here?

 ​
 TLDR; Does SMS store failed files/directories in its logs?
 Having completed an inventory scan I've got around 300 failed folders which i can't seem to find any reference for in the logs (obtained using the StorageMigrationServiceHelper PowerShell Module)
 I've tried using AccessEnum to query folders i don't have permissions to and it comes back with Access being in place except 1 file. It also seems to only return a small fraction of items with the default or 'display only files that have permissions less restrictive than parent' on
 Have ran various PowerShell scripts to query access also and around 100 items are path too long etc but this still doesn't match the number of failed folders on D and G drives.
 Seems like i'll end up migrating whats been inventoried so that it gets the bulk over and creates the shares (won't be using the cutover) and then likely Robocopy the rest but id obviously rather have the SMS takes care of things for me.
 ​
 Any advice/ insights would be appreciated :)
 ​
 Cheers

Let’s say we have a hybrid 365 with onprem dc and exchange, As we may know, we cannot decommission on prem exchange after mailbox migration is finished as on prem exchange manages some of the attributes of user mailboxes.
 Would it be a problem if you you disabled user sync and went cloud only, decommissioned exchange, removed AD attributes, then setup user sync again?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I discovered that 463 of the 1801 Dutch government domains are unnecessarily vulnerable to code injection and XSS attacks due to the use of static `nonces` in the Content-Security-Policy. A `nonce` should not be guessable and should be generated randomly on every request. The official documentation is clear on this: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#security-nonces.
 I have reported to the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC), and they confirm the incorrect implementation but do not consider it a security problem. "We will, therefore, not process your report further," said an anonymous employee. In addition, I was still imposed that I may not disclose which domains are involved.
 I stumbled upon this problem by chance and selflessly took the trouble to map out the scope of the problem and report it properly. I am not in this for a bounty or anything; I just wanted to help out.
 It is disappointing to see that the Dutch government cannot implement basic security measures according to specifications to protect visitors against malicious parties. This was an absolute waste of my time.

 I'm now asking for any suggestions on some concrete metrics that we could monitor or just any ideas for performance monitoring.
 Luckily our boss is really cool about this process and we can define all the metrics and what is a successful day/week/month ourselves.

 ​
 Throughout the year we've been progressively working on improving email hygiene for our clients, this includes add SPF failure (hard-fail and hard-error) quarantining in the email security platform. 
 ​
 the big player has reached out to our client several times, saying we're blocking their email. I've tried to reach back, to find the right person, people or team in in the organisation and asked the few contacts I actually have to help me find the wrong person. Their response is "none of our other clients are reporting this problem, you just need to white list us."
 ​
 Here's the thing. They have two SPF records, which fails just on that alone. they have no DKIM keys. They have DMARC configured using proofpoint, but basically acheiving nothing (p=none). 
 My response is, well, they need to fix their shit. They created these SPF records, someone must be responsible for it. For us to just white list them (considering the industry) is, imo, the wrong decision to make because it then opens up our client to the risk of receiving fake and/or malicious emails from this sender. 
 ​
 I've communicated with my client serveral times about the issue. So far they haven't explicitly (or otherwise) told me to white list it and I know they trust my judgement.
 ​
 So, Am I the Asshole here, for trying to protect my client (and, I suppose the sender, who is ASX50) and trying to refer it back to them to fix their problem?

 My manager says I was let go for having issues one too many times. And I have made mistakes. Ive tried to correct those and move one. The straw that broke the camels back was when a script Ive run for years to reset system account passwords went sideways and accidentally locked out like 50 service accounts. 
 But Im about a decade away from retirement and I was burned out there. Over the years management has expected more and more out of my team and I admit as I gotten older Ive had more and more trouble staying sharp and motivated.
 If I stay in IT how do I spin "hey Im 50+, and got burned out at my old job"?
 Im even thinking I may not want to stay in IT. What do you guys think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About two years ago I started at a small/medium business with a few hundred employees. We were almost all on prem, very few cloud services outside of MS365. The company previously had one guy who was essentially "good with computers" set things up but they grew to the size where they needed an IT guy full time, which isn't super unusual.
 But the owner was incredibly cheap. When I started they had a few working virtual host servers but they had zero backups - absolutely nothing on prem was being backed up externally. In my first month there I went to the owner and explained how bad things would be if we didn't have any off site backups we were doomed. I looked into free cloud alternatives but there wasn't anything that would fit our needs.
 Management was very clear - the budget for backups is $0, and "nothing is going to happen, you worry too much"
 So I decided to do it myself. I figured out how much I could set aside each week and started saving. I didn't make a whole lot but I did have extra money each month. I was determined to have a disaster recovery plan, even if they didn't want to pay for it.
 And some of you may remember, Hurricane Ian hit a few months ago. We were not originally predicted to take the brunt of it, and management wanted no downtime, so we did not physically remove the server from the premises. The storm damaged the building and we experienced some pretty severe data loss. 
 So it was time for my disaster recovery plan. The day after, we gathered at the building and discovered the damage. After confirming we had lost data, I said "I quit," I got in my car, and lived off the 6 months of savings I had. Tomorrow I start my new job. Disaster recovery plan worked exactly how I planned.

 Now I've joined a startup and we're setting up our own AWS environment, and establishing private connectivity from scratch is uncharted ground for me. As a startup, we are essentially all "floating" right now --- we don't have a dedicated office with a dedicated network range, or any sort of on-premise presence.
 But, we need a way to access EC2, RDS, etc. without public IP addresses (and preferably without a publicly exposed bastion/jumpbox to get there). We don't have anything massively critical, and we will grow, so by the time we do, we can revisit this to really flesh out a sturdy solution. But right now I just need some basic items I can go through to ensure only our people can access our AWS resources.
 For VPN options that aren't site-to-site, "Client VPN" seems like an option: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/introducing-aws-client-vpn-to-securely-access-aws-and-on-premises-resources/
 If someone can just tell me if I'm warm or cold on this, and point me in the direction of the necessary service/tool that I need, that would be great. Thanks!

I’m trying to explain to my coworkers that if we do that HSRP will not work due to the switches not being able to directly see each other (there now being two hops to get to the other). I’ve tried setting something up in a lab of course I didn’t get it to work but I wanted to get y’all’s input on a better explanation on why this wouldn’t work OR if it can work and I’m just missing something.

I quickly responded that it was and went about my business. I then received a meeting request show up in my email box. It included HR VP, Legal, Recruiting and the CFO.
 Initially I didn't think about it because I was busy. Then as I slowed down and thought about it and all weekend I freaked myself out about it. Why was HR calling me and why was legal included.
 I sheepishly walked into HR office today not knowing what to expect. As it turns out they want to replace the applicant tracking system and needed my support.
 I relayed my angst to the HR folks before the meeting got going. They thought it was funny and laughed it off about a guilty conscience. 
 How many ways can an IT guy mess up and not even know it? HR Should be more thorough in their communications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Assuming you have a SoT like Netbox and some device discovery software like solarwinds. I'm always confused which one should be the entry point for device on-boarding?
 Add device to Solarwinds and then Solarwinds populates Netbox with all device information?
 OR
 Populate the device in Netbox and then it adds the device to Solarwinds
 The issue here is circular dependency, Netbox should be the ultimate SoT meaning it dictates the intent whether to have the device in the network in the first place or not, how the interfaces should look like, IP addresses etc.., so in a sense, it must be the entry point. but at the same the device needs to be populated first to see that are the interfaces, IPs etc.
 in a sense both should be diff'ed to see the actual vs intended and point out if there's a deviation, but i'm not sure what's the best approach to start integrating both. any thoughts?

I took a brief glance at their page and some of Safing's documentation (which I believe sounds like an extra service on top of the open source portmaster), and I'm trying to understand -
 Is this essentially application filtering, but on a local firewall as opposed to a network device? 
 I understand portmaster itself is open source and very configurable and safing has some extra services they've built that portmaster can leverage, but ignoring all that portmaster is more or less a software firewall kind of like pfsense, just for your local machine?

After a mix of multiple 1U/2U servers, routers, and switches that all have redundant power supplies I am both out of outlets and the bundle of power cables on the side is out of hand. I used some d ring but those also take up 1U since the server rails are the nice quick install ones from HP/Dell. The DC has suggested Y splitter cables which I would like to avoid as they seem a point of failure. I wanted to know how anyone has solved this in the past? Are there d-rings that work with server rails, is there some nice way to organize this that I don't know?

 I've setup everything, so, policy sets (and everything that goes with it), Meraki SSID side of things and a Guest Portal, Guest Type, Sponsor Portal and a Sponsor Group.
 When a user logs in they get redirected to the Guest Portal, where they are given the chance to register and then from there they register fine, an approval email goes out, as well as me seeing the account created on the Sponsor Portal to, I approve the account. I can see the username/pw etc... but when the user tries to login with the creds, it fails with an Authentication Failed error.
 The guests are registering their devices in the GuestEndPoints internal store (but not showing up in there)
 In the logs I can see the users request actually pass and being permitted also (so it passes the check on the GuestEndPoints store to, I think because this laptop has already logged in tbf on the network many times prior to this)
 But for whatever reason I cannot get the user to login.
 I have 2 authorisation policies in the policy set to, the second one matches on the wireless type (wireless MAB) which is what shows up in the logs, the first in the chain is a policy that matches on the wireless authentication type again (wireless MAB) but also the Radius Case being "Guest Flow" also, with the VLAN authorisation profile I want to give the guest. I assumed this is done via somekind of CoA on ISE after the user is approved, but this policy never shows up in the logs and is never hit

 I have a question for the folks who work in big ISPs who perform CGNAT and PBA for customers. 
 What happens when a customer requires a new port block to be allocated, and the current IP they have the port block for has all ports exhausted? Theoretically, whatever devices should try to free up port blocks for that IP, but if it can't, I assume the user gets a different port block on a different public IP. Now the user has 1 port block on one IP and another port block on a different IP. 
 I can imagine how this would impact various applications, but would like someone who runs this in a large production environment to shed some light on this.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got a very simple playbook to use cisco.iosxr.iosxr_command from the galaxy collection for iosxr to push some raw config commands.
 It works against the ASR9k platform, but not against an NCS540 with no changes to code or connect method or any of the host/group vars compared to what I'm doing for the ASR chassis.
 The error isn't specific to a config not being liked, but rather it's like it's failing to connect (I've tried with AAA in place and using local creds only even though there's no login specific error).
 ​
 The error I'm getting is "msg": "[Errno -2] Name or service not known" when it goes to run the first task. the full verbose traceback which states it may not be related to the actual failure only references 2 things.... some iosxr.py file from the collection itself, line 179 get_capabilities.... capabilities = Connection(module._socket_path).get_capabilities() and a reference to a connection.py file in ansible module_utils line 200 in __rpc__ raise ConnectionError(to_text(msg, errors='surrogate_then_replace'), code=code) followed by my task that just sends configure terminal and some simple logging commands.
 ​
 I've confirmed all of the commands work fine on the NCS platform. The error is the same regardless of if I use any other iosxr method like for banners or logging which is why I tried switching to iosxr_command to rule out any weirdness but it's still there and only when pushing to the NCS540.
 I'm using network_cli for the connection and iosxr for the network_os in the group_vars vars file for this platform, same as the ASR.
 ​
 Any ideas? Any help is appreciated!

 I have user and guest SSIDs running through two ISE nodes.
 All ok if the work of the ISE is done by the "master" node, instead it doesn't work if the ISE on the track is the "slave".
 This causes it to have no HA, which is very strange since the fixtures are synchronized.
 What do you think? Where can I make sure they are actually in sync and back up each other?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 Not a network expert by any means so would like some insight or direction as to whether this is an issue or I'm barking up the wrong tree etc.
 Our client uses this ZScaler App to route all traffic to a UK range they host.
 Example IP would be: 165.225.16.240
 IF I ping this IP there is some loss of packets, ranges between 2-5%. If I ping Google there is no packet loss.
 When I do a traceroute there is always packet loss at the Zayo hop:
 Tracing route to 165.225.17.15 over a maximum of 30 hops:
 1 1 ms <1 ms <1 ms 192.168.99.1
 2 23 ms 32 ms 1 ms 62......
 (Exits Network Gateway)
 3 1 ms 1 ms 1 ms 212......
 4 6 ms 4 ms 2 ms 62.........
 5 8 ms 2 ms 7 ms ge-3-3-0.mpr1.lhr3.uk.above.net [195.66.236.76]
 6 3 ms \ ** ae9.cs1.lhr15.uk.eth.zayo.com [64.125.24.210]
 7 \ * * Request timed out.*
 8 8 ms 6 ms 9 ms 94.31.30.187.IPYX-069051-042-ZYO.zip.zayo.com [94.31.30.187]
 9 4 ms 4 ms 10 ms 165.225.17.15
 Another reading.. before it reaches the ZScaler service:
 Host Longitude Latitude Location Name Packet Sent Packet Received Loss
 ae9.cs1.lhr15.uk.eth.zayo.com 37.751 -97.822 United States 300 80 73.333336
 ae12.mpr3.lhr8.uk.zip.zayo.com 37.751 -97.822 United States 300 252 16
 ZScaler confirmed nothing to do with them, a third party ISP. So am I looking to engage with our ISP about this you reckon?
 Or am I just barking up the wrong tree and this is nothing to be worried about?
 The client say they are being disconnected random times.. when I check the on-site MX i cant see any issues with latency or packet loss etc.. no downtime of any sort.. i can only think the zscaler service is going down and maybe confusing the clients network adapter switching from zscaler back to lan etc..
 Anyway can someone let me know if this Zayo route is a ISP issue or ZScaler.
 Cheers.

 I just accepted an offer with my old employer after getting fed up with poor corporate culture and being asked to handle too many tasks in the 11 months I have been with new job. I was going to walk from my new job almost immediately but I decided to keep working through my disdain for my current employer. It didn't work out. I am burned out after less than a year. Now I have a heaping plate of projects that I am going to leave up for my Director of IT to deal with all by himself. I'm honestly terrified to hand in my letter of resignation I see it ending with getting screamed at by the IT Director followed by him having a stroke. The place I am at now needs a whole IT Department I carry all the Infrastructure Engineer, Network Engineer, Systems administration and Help Desk Duties for a $500M a year company.
 I would honestly just walk out if I didn't live in such a small community. I would run into the people I fuck over pretty frequently if I did.
 ​
 UPDATE:
 Haha I haven't drafted a resignation letter yet and just had 2 more projects dumped on me.

 I have a virtual machine, that multiple users join via Remote Desktop, and they all use the same local user (MACHINENAME\USERNAME) so they all have the exact same everything everywhere including applications;
 Problem is that, being more than 5 users, they don't really know when or if someone else is already connected to it, so they always kick out one each other without notice;
 Is there a way to prevent this? Could I limit the number of remote sessions or to "lock" it until someone disconnects? Or even just find a way for them to see if someone's already using it?
 Thank you very much in advice, have a great day!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 So I have a Microsoft Surface Tablet that is going to be deployed in a public facing area. Essentially, it will be on a website with two options, the main one being to print a label that a user has been emailed. Clicking that button opens the camera and scans a QR code, once code has been read it will prompt the user to click a print label button where i'd like it to silently print said label to an attached label printer. The site is all working and tested fine.
 So i've created an intune profile for the browser, using Microsoft Kiosk Browser app rather than Edge so that it displays fullscreen with no navigation bars etc. There is an additional configuration profile setup to Force Allow the browser access to the camera. The first part works fine, However the print page takes me to an error page (the page works in normal edge so i know it works) the error shows:
 sorry that file type is unsupported blob:[mywebsiteaddress] 
 So i'm assuming that the Kiosk Browser app doesn't support printing?.
 If i then change the browser in the configuration profile to MS Edge, printing will work fine, however, its not a full screen browser window and has navigation options, I still get the prompts to allow the camera, and I also get a print dialog screen which i really don't want. 
 My questions are:
  
Can someone pin point where that first error might come from with regards to printing in the Kiosk Browser app
 If not, is there a way or an option that im missing to force edge into full screen mode and allow the camera access and disable the print screen.
  
The Kiosk Browser is the prefered option.

The issue is that with office files, a hidden lock file is created when an Office file (docs, xlsx, etc.) is opened by a user. This file contains the meta data for who has a file locked in case someone else on the network tries to open it. Since they are unable to access the file, a message states the file is locked by "User" instead of the actual user's name.
 The only identifying features I can find for these files are the first 2 characters of the file name are always ~$ and that their file properties lists HSA as attributes.
 Is there already an AD attribute I can use for FCI that can reference either the first 2 characters of the file name HSA attribute of the file so I can allow read only access?

 The budget for new computers didn't go through so we have at least the rest of the school year.
 Does having all these slow devices hinder the other items in the switch? What about some of the 10mbps Devices like access control, intercom links, and VOIP phones?
 Would it be better to put all the 100mbps Macs on one switch where they can be in the slow lane on their own?

 My newish job has a bunch of technologies I'm not that familiar with. Ansible, kubernetes, docker.. it's predominantly a Linux environment. I'm thinking of spinning up a lab that can somehow incorporate all these elements.
 How do you guys manage your own personal labs these days? Is it still best to get a physical server? I'm traveling around a lot so a cloud based solution would be ideal, unless I setup wake on LAN with a server or something. 
 I suppose if it's a bunch of Linux VMs they'll be fairly low resource requirements so maybe it wouldn't be too costly in the cloud.

 If you just right click on this icon you click on open file location then you can still go to the hidden network share which is blocked if you type in the adres in the file explorer how is this possible? 
 Is there GPO or something im missing? that prevents this? 
 I have found the option to remove open file location option all together but we dont want that we only want it prevented for that specify hidden share.

 Essentially I need some network-wide remote access to the devices.
 Any ideas how can this be achieved ? or what type of network should I look for ? Is there something similar I can get inspiration from ?
 The network should be able to endure high bandwidth of data exchange (20-300MBs).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m using Robocopy to migrate files from our production file server to an archive file server.
 I have performed a dry run and the total dataset summarised is 3TB and approximately 2M files.
 On the production server (Windows 2016) I run the data dedupe service, and we achieve a huge benefit from this as the volume is 2TB but the data on it is around 4TB and I have .5TB free space reported. My current Deduplication rate for the production volume is 67%
 If I run my live Robocopy job to migrate the folder that has 3TB reported will it retain the deduplication when moved or will it try to move 3TB of data onto the volume? Essentially undoing the dedupe.
 My Archive server has 1.1TB free space on the data volume (which is the same size as our production file server at 2TB) and also has deduplication service enabled.
 I do have the capability to spin backups of these VMs up in a lab to test the move works but with that amount of data it will take quite some time, so hoping someone here can provide some insight into their experience moving similar sized datasets.
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says, what makes you believe online password managers like LastPass, 1Password etc are really end to end encrypted, there are no intentional backdoors or that they won't sell your passwords to any 3rd party? Is it just their privacy policy? 
 Or is it just the fact that the benefits of using a password manager at all greatly outweighs the risks of password manager company "turning to the dark side"?
 By using a password manager, you are in fact completely trusting your digital identity and privacy to them. If I were any government's agency, I'd sponsor my own password manager so that all people are willingly handing their identities over to me and I wouldn't even need to move a finger...
 Personally, I'm using KeePass which is open source so that much wider community is able to review it's code for possible weaknesses and, more importantly, backdoors. I'm also using a composite master key to unlock the database. One part is stored locally on my devices while the other part is a password that I regularly type. This way I can keep my password reasonably short for greater convenience and still practically impossible to brute-force by anyone that could possible get hold of my database. This enables me to keep the database in the cloud, which I also do not trust.

Thankfully we've employed another person to deal with helpdesk and minor issues last year, so that's good. Backup system is decent. Hopefully we will be buying a tape library in the next year to bullet proof it. People call me or inform me when they get suspicious email without opening attachments or clicking links.
 Now for the main thing. Since the ransomware we had in daughter company in 2019, every time someone contacts me with a computer, server or other it issue or I get an alarm from our systems I almost get a panic attack. Same thing when something unexpected happens when working on my pc whether it is a warning or a window pops up or a random web page stops responding for a second or two. It was not that bad in the beginning but the last 6 months were bad to the point I think of quitting without another job lined up. I have the monetary means to do it, but I would rather dealt with the issue.
 Talking with my boss and the owner is definitely on my list. How else can I deal with it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We just renewed our license for our helpdesk. When I had some quality time with the boss I asked him what he thought of the helpdesk we’ve had for a year now. 
 We used to all (4 of us) just operate out of a shared mailbox. A lot of the time we’d double or triple-up on work because of the shared mailbox. We would all unknowingly work on the same thing. 
 I like the system because I have a clear list of things to work on and if I start working on something I pick it up and it’s mine. If one of the other guys starts working on it, since I’m generally faster I can be like “bro, gotta pick up what you’re working on.” (That sounds more asshole than I mean, I swear)
 Boss’ main complaint is he can’t easily tell what we’re all working on without going into our individual queues. He feels out of touch with what we’re doing. 
 So does anyone have any suggestions for a ME SD+ report that can show him what we’re currently working on and have for the last X days? Something he can quickly run to make sure we’re doing our jobs? We’re hosted so any grand ideas I have for report options are limited, and the interface is lacking (at least for me). Tried posting similar requests on the ME sub but it’s moderated to hell and nothing has been approved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[noob question: I have four physical windows 10 pro PCs connected to a ml350p HP gen 8 running windows 2016 server (which has 3 virtual desktops) for my small business. My team connects to their physical or desktop PC remotely. ML350p is my domain controller. Assume I only use ML350p for the virtual desktops and to share files.
 All good. Except the ml350p is in my flat. It's big, throws off heat and can get get quite noisy.
 What to do?
  
AWS virtual desktops seem really expensive eg 67 USD per month per standard desktop.
 I could get an AWS windows server but then how do i connect my physical desktop PCs to it on the domain, i think i need a VPN?
 I have [unused] one drive for business so i could get rid of the ml350p and get a few more desktops and restrict one drive for business to those physical PCs (for security i can't let any personal PC access the one drive)
 Could I (eg) get a t3.2xlarge aws server (USD ~ 400 per month) and create seven desktop VMs on that? or would i need more windows licences/Ad server/costs?
  
I am happy to have a few more physical desktops that people remote into. I want to get rid of the physical server. I still don't really get it - option 4 would be USD 4800 per year. i could buy a new physical server and a 2019 licence for that and then save the 4800 per year.
 I am desktop PC proficient, (build my own), pretty numerate but I find windows server really opaque. I am lost in the jargon and the options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m looking for some guidance in the right direction. I’m familiar with the basic concepts of networking but there a few concepts i am looking to understand better. 
  
The first revolves around BGP in the data center. I understand that this is really dependent on what your doing/goal. To lay this out based on my lab in EVE-ng let’s say I’ve got two nexus switches. Each one handles an ISP connection. The ISPs have 2 /30s and we are advertises out a /24. Does it make sense to have the switches handle the BGP or is it more common practice to have a device dedicated to that and the switches handle things like vxlan/spine leaf topology. 
 
How do firewalls get implemented? I can’t imagine data center firewalls would be doing router on a stick and the wan side just points to whatever is advertising the BGP? I guess I’m thinking of this as a regular office firewall but I can’t quite figure out how to google implementing a firewall into a data center.

 Something to do with the time interval?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work in a small team supporting a large HPC cluster, and because we’re a small team we rely on support contracts via our hardware vendors to ship out replacement parts and send out service techs to our data centers to fix them.
 Trying to get techs on site to fix hardware is borderline impossible compared to pre-2020. I have to follow up dozens of times to get techs out after repeated no-shows.
 We’re a Lenovo shop and that means most hardware support is done by IBM, (some part of the Byzantine IBM/Lenovo deal back in the day I’m sure). I’m not sure if this is just usual pain from IBM circling the drain or if other people are noticing this with different vendors as well? Lenovo is great at shipping out the parts but getting the tech on site is simply not happening anymore which really reduces the value of the warranty imo.
 What are your experiences with getting vendor hardware support? Are you all having better experiences with Dell or HPE?

I do not want to have the remote desktop tool installed on their physical machines at work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Afternoon Everyone,
 I'm currently tasked with researching new possibilities to upgrading our current storage solutions to better fit our future and development.
 A little background on our data. We accumulate around 4PBs of data per year or so and that data rarely gets purged or removed. It is usually acquired in 2 GB files, TBs at a time. (20+ TBs per collection).
 This data gets processed on local machines or GPU/CPU clusters.
 Data is stored raw and processed.
 We currently use JBOD raids but we've found that with data storage being in the PBs, we are setting up new PB raids every few years or so and essentially "upgrading" them means rebuilding with new HDDs or just buying a whole new rack/raid. We also have an insane amount of file shares because of each raid.
 Would a scale out solution like CEPH or GlusterFS be a better solution? Would we be better off keeping RAID configurations? What other solutions could provide for this?
 I had a hard time wrapping my head around which solution would be best because of I/O density/etc.
 We aren't against vendor supported builds but would prefer to learn and grow our experiences in storage to provide direct support later down the road and grow our professional portfolios.
 Funding and time aren't huge issues, and we've been given some funds to build a small "proof of concept" for whichever system we can find that fits the criteria. This would include training/etc.

However, I have learned enough to be able to set dual-mode/native vlans on ethernet ports (1/1/1-1/1/24) but I can't seem to get the same process to set dual-mode/native vlans on fiber ports (1/2/1-1/2/4). I have tried from the command line as well as the web interface. The VLANs page in the configuration looks correct - every vlan is tagged (except the default vlan) and then dual-mode is set on the native vlan that I want. However, when I got to the fiber port, it will still show vlan 0 as the native vlan even if I have set dual-mode on vlan 999.
 I know I'm missing something but my searches so far have turned up nothing. Thanks for any help you can provide.

 One of offices uses facilities provided wireless network where our users connect to and then establish Always On VPN over SSTP protocol to HQ. As much it is odd, this is necessary as all our computers use HQ located Proxy (for now as it is going to be replaced with cloud proxy solution).
 Down to the problem, had calls from users where they state that Outlook is failing to connect tot he Exchange server, Microsoft Teams reporting poor call quality, websites taking actual seconds to load.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, my company is in the planning stages for a fairly significant roll-out of new hardware spread across our province. This is happening in the next 8-12 months.
 We will have ~3,500 locations and each location will be getting a minimum of 1 new device, some will be getting as many as 6 or 7 devices.
 The idea is on a certain date and time, all of these devices will be powered on in small window (1-4 hours) on a exact date. This is a regulatory requirement, so we can't pre-load or delay load to these devices.
 Each device will have to download 1-5 files from our system hosted in AWS via one of two of our datacenters The files will be 10-20MB in size. We have a Direct Connect connection from both of our DC's to AWS.
 ~2,800 of these sites use LTE and are on a private APN, they route to our 2 datacenters via MPLS circuits from our Telco. The speed at these sites averages between 15-20Mps.
 The remaining 700 or so sites use Internet, and route to our 2 datacenters via a pair of Internet circuits from different vendors. The speed at these sites is anywhere from 3Mbps (Satellite) up to 100+Mbps (Cable)
 Now to my question, I want to make sure our MPLS and Internet circuits (and AWS Direct Connect circuits) are scaled accordingly to support all of these downloads in this window. We want to make sure the downloads happen fairly quick (say less than say 10 minutes per device).
 Does anyone know of an online calulator that would help me do the math?
 I definitely plan on contacting our Telco to get their input, but I want to have some numbers (at least rough numbers) before engaging them to make sure they're not making shit up.
 As you can imagine this is a very large and very important implementation (we're on year 3 of the project) for my company and I want my portion (the network) to go as smoothly as possible.
 Any input would be muchly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About a month ago, I cut over from a sonicwall to a watchguard firewall for a customer. One of the interfaces is an uplink to a meraki router. Apparently the sonicwall had DHCP configured for this interface but I didn’t catch that when configuring the new firewall. So the cutover happens and all appears to be working fine in the environment. Until today. The customer lost power last night and thats when the meraki router was no longer reachable. I spent an hour on the phone with the vendor who manages the meraki troubleshooting what could be the issue. I was out of ideas until they mentioned that they are configured for DHCP and that’s when I realized I never set up a DHCP sever for the interface (because when do routers use DHCP? Is this standard practice or something now?) Anyways, I configured a small address pool and the router came back online. I’m just surprised that the router maintained its lease from the previous firewall for as long as it did. At least I’m assuming that’s how it was still able to function. Anyone experience anything similar?

 In a live environment, what show commands do you recommend I do before doing the upgrade?
 I've done it on switches before (sh cdp neighbours, show mac address-table, show up route, show vers, etc). What would be best practice for a firewall?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 New place I have started working at have a firewall with a less than optimal config. I am trying to get my head around it to make some improvements. They currently have a:
 Corporate Network (which I would like the VPN to be able to access) (10.*.*.*)
 VPN IP Range (172.1.*.*)
 Seperate Gateway VLAN (172.2.*.*) for servers they can access - these servers have an IP in both corporate and seperate VLAN, with gateway only entered on the seperate VLAN. This VLAN also has its own DNS which is what VPN clients are currently pointed to and provides the gateway VLAN ip address for these servers
 Issue is that people feel restricted, cant access file shares as if they were in work etc., have to remote on to an RDP server and productivity is suffering. My thoughts are that if the VPN is secure and has MFA in place, they can be considered secure enough to access all (or rather most - some is still locked behind other VLANs) corporate resources and work exactly as if they were in the office.
 So, to the issue - 
  
I have put a rule in place on the firewall to allow fully authenticated users access to the corporate VLAN.
 
I have updated the DNS on my computer to the corporate DNS. With this in place DNS works and I can ping ALL servers on the corporate VLAN except those with an IP address in both networks.
 
Pinging the other servers on their Gateway IP address works
 DNS gets the correct IP but I cant ping these on the corporate IP range.
 
 I suspect this is a routing and / or firewall issue but any pointers on where I should be looking would be greatly appreciated!

 VLAN 1 port 1 to 48.
 WEB-GUI access only port 25-48. Web access port 1-23 do not connect. 
 Although when I connect the router to port 1, only 1 - 23 are switching and connecting from/to internet
 Router to port 24, only 24-48 are switching and connecting from/to internet
 So it looks like 1-23 and 24-48 are somehow separated or not fully functional.
 Hardware, Software or Set-up Problem ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm at a loss. We have installed a new HVAC system and each of the 4 pieces of equipment has an internal IP (statically configured - no DHCP). The HVAC vendor has specialized (and very expensive) software in his laptop that is needed in order to configure/troubleshoot/etc.
 The request is to provide him remote access to prevent the cost and travel time for him to come to the location. I am using an Ubiquiti UDM-Pro router and created a VPN. I can add desktops to this VPN (including his), but there is no way (that I know) to add those 4 pieces of equipment to this VPN network just by configuring their NICs.
 I considered creating a VLAN with or without its own public IP. That would add all the HVAC equipment on its own private subnet, but would run into the same issue on how to give his remote workstation access to this IP network? I can only think of a way to VPN the router itself given the limitations I have to change the equipment at hand.
 Hopefully I am missing something obvious. Tks in advance.

 I recently got a new job as an Automation Specialist but was laid off 3 months in due to budget. I've been looking for jobs for 1.5 months now, and still don't have one.
 As far as interviews go, I've gotten:
 15 1st interviews with HR/Recruiters
 5 2nd Interviews
 2 3rd+ Interviews
 My question is, is this normal? I know it's not a good time of year to find a job, and the layoffs nationally make competing for full remote jobs difficult. There's unfortunately not a lot going on in my city for jobs at the moment, especially with my limited experience. 
 I'm wondering if I should attribute this to 'hard time for jobs', or if I'm actually doing something wrong. I feel overqualified for Desktop Support jobs, but underqualified for System Engineer jobs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi.
 We are expanding our datacenter with another datacenter about 100m apart from our main DC.
 Our current network design is that our mainbuilding (DC-1) has a core firewall/router with dual ISPs and ROAS directly to access switches. It also has direct connection to our ICS-network firewalls (for temporary RDP-access from internet) which in turn also is Router on a stick down to the ICS access switches.
 So basically theres only a core layer and an access layer.
 The new building (DC-2) will have its own subnets and networks, but will need to be connected to DC-1 since the SCADA-server is there.
 THe buildings will have a lot of fibers between them. I was thinking of placing 2x L3 switches in each building (instead of core direct access to access layer) with redudant links to each core FW in DC-1. So basically sharing the core layer between the DCs, but a separate distribution layer in each building.
 I am by no means a network expert, but has some experience. Unfortunately i've been asked to fix something between the DCs. Appreaciate any tips!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been thinking on my career, and how I'm now in a job where I am just a caretaker of hardware and do some minor admin duties, but paid more than I ever have been, and how some of the most active jobs I've had were both the lowest paying and most stressful, but some of those were also the most fun. I looked back on the older jobs I've had, and I keep getting into jobs where I am doing less and less of what is in my skillset, and in some cases less actual work, while getting paid more, as I get older and gain skills. 
 I miss the days when I was managing the virtual architecture, making and managing the VMs, architecting AD, DNS, DHCP, and WDS, doing the backups, checking everything out in the morning and doing things all day long. I miss the troubleshooting days of desktop support, where I had some mysterious problem and had to actually figure out what was going wrong and fix it, rather than just wipe machines and start them over. I actually miss the days when my workload took up most of my day, but I sure don't miss the crap pay I'd get for it. 
 Why do you suppose this is? Why is the pay for doing the most work so much lower than jobs where the workload is so much less? Has anyone else encountered this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently working as Helpdesk Support for a massive corporate gaming company (6,000+ employees).
 I'm very comfortable in my job, and whilst the role is basic, the benefits are great.
 I am the only IT in the office of 150 users, and my manager is based in another country. So I report to no one in person. 
 I have my own office, with direct access to a roof terrace where I can enjoy fresh air, coffee and a view. My office has a fully catered kitchen, where we are provided fresh food and cooked meals daily. They pay for my medical insurance, gym membership and pension. The employees are great people that I get on with very well too. 
 But here's the hitch...
 I've been offered 25% increase on my salary by an oil company. This company, whilst paying considerably more, do not offer these little perks. No free food, no gym, no nice view, and my desk would be in the middle of the main office.
 They would also expect me to be able to assist outside of normal hours, and even on occasion, do jobs that would not normally fall under the scope of work for Helpdesk support.
 My conundrum is do I stay where I am, in a big, comfortable, established company with all of these benefits, or risk it all for 25% pay increase? 
 What would you do?

 Looking for some of your opinions / recommendations for installing PhPIPAM in terms of hardware. I work for a large global enterprise who is largely currently using excel to track IP's. Long term strategy is to bring in a enterprise grade IPAM (Efficent IP, Infoblox, etc) but in the meantime (until we can get budget) we need to get some sort of sane way (not excel) to track IP's across a very large global org. Enter PhPIPAM. 
 I am working on getting a RHEL server built to install this on but for the life of me cannot find any sort of recommendations on hardware. I know it does not require much in terms of CPU/Mem but definitely do not want to undershoot it and have performance issues down the road. 
 Any opinions / suggestions? 
 Thanks.

 For example, we host an application that uses object store as it's backend, and we would like to backup the files in the object store, preferably the backup should land in object store as well (using block storage for backup would defeat the cost advantages of using object store in the first place).
 One option I found was using rlcone to synchronize all the contents to a different object store, however this is slow, and does not easily provide files from X days ago.
 How do you handle this problem at your organization? Or is this a killer argument against using object store at all for you?
 Curious to hear, and thanks already :)

 Question 1:
 The useable pool size is 18.1 TB, so am I correct to assume 9TB would be usable?
 Is the 9 TB of data distributed across the 4 drives, so that there are always 2 copies?
 What I'm afraid of is that I do not have full redundancy across 9TB of data do to the uneven number of TBs relative to HDDs.
 Question 2:
 If I was to purchase a new 8TB drive can I easily removed a 4TB drive from the pool?
 So I would end up with 2x4TB and 2x8TB, pool size would be ~24TB with usable space ~12TB?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am not sure if it is right community in reddit for this question.
 I am looking for information what mobility management function exactly mean. For me as a someone who spent the almost whole life with math, function means an expression, rule, or law that defines a relationship between one variable and another variable, equation with x, y,z
 In network theory it seems, it has different meaning.
 Can someone explain what network function for mobility management mean or look like?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a LoB app that uses the %TEMP% location to save attachment content for emails. User clicks task in the app, a %TEMP%/123/45678.pdf is created (both 123 folder, and 45678.pdf). Once done the app seems to rename the contract_90123.pdf. effective permissions also show full access for this location.
 That rename appears to be intermittently failing, so the expected attachment isnt present and the email fails to generate. procmon shows 'path not found' on the rename operation.
 From the information i've gathered so far, it's an infrequent failure but when it happens appears to occur for a period of time. We appear to be fine for a week but last week we had it occur for all generated email attachments and was 100% reproducable.
 The infra is RDS2019 (6 servers) using UPD's, which runs on S2D storage. %TEMP% was not originally included in the UPD but as of an hour ago now included for testing. I doubt that will have any fix due. There's no apparent heavy resource usage or noticable performance issues when the issue occurs to suspect heavy load.
 We seem to have no other issues on the RDS's other than this rename operation failing. Running the app locally also has no problems. LoB support say it's an issue with our environment and with it only occuing on our RDS's, i'm inclined to beleive them.
 Any sugestions on what to do to further diagnose this one? due to the seeming isolated file, i'm out of ideas as anything i can come up with (eg: bad disk/ram/network) would affect far more than this.

 Before I started my company I was a sysadmin for a municipality with specialized certification for windows servers and CCNA. Now my certifications are invalid and I'm thinking of renewing certs. But I still want to have my own company and work as a consultant.
 My question is, in what area is there a lack of competence or highly sought after? I was thinking of getting certs for Azure and Office 365 with powershell and SharePoint. Is that a good way to go?
 I live in Europe where it's more common to get a salary job than being an independent consultant.

 How do you 'manage' permission changes to folder structures in SharePoint Online?
 We currently ask that users create a ticket requesting access with a link to what they need - IT then get authorisation from manager.
 Or we ask authorised managers to request it for a user.
 This is so we have a log of permission changes, this log of request/authorisation needs to stay put of course, along with the auditable actions by IT.
 It's just of a PITA right? We get loads of requests per day, wondering how other organisations make these changes as they scale and grow as an organisation?
 Just to add, I am looking at implementing PIM/Identify Governance using security groups as a way to combat it, anyone use this for SharePoint permissions? Advice on its implementation? Best ways to allow users to know which groups are for which folders?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sometimes an user will suffer an IT related issue, and somehow from the symptoms presented and their limited knowledge will formulate an answer by "filling in the gaps" and coming up with 2+2 = orange.
 My favourite example of this was a few years ago at a small office where filesharing was dealt with by a Dell Poweredge server, and wifi was dealt with using a few cheap APs. One day the server's PSU fell over, and while one on-site tech was fixing it the office manager/company director asked "has the server failed because there's too much WiFi?". It took every fibre of my being to respond "no, that's not how it works" with a straight face
 Another was a chap who couldn't log in to one of our AzureAD workstations. His hypothesis? "I'm logged in to my laptop at my desk so the system obviously won't let me log in to two systems at once". The actual reason was he'd got his account password wrong...

 He asked me simple questions after that, such as the definition of DNS, kernel, OSI model... I answered most of it but he told me that i still need to give it a revision, and go for a technical test in a couple of days. 
 The test will consist on a google form with questions related to my position, so it's all about collecting information here and there i guess..
 If i pass that test, i will jump to the technical interview which is probably the hardest part of the whole process. I'm not sure if i can make it since i barely got any experience or knowledge in cloud computing overall. I'm also not sure about what are they looking for exactly since you jump to their formation program even if u nail all the interviews, i'm not sure if i can make it to that point just with a few days of studying basic stuff.
 What would you guys suggest me?

It should come as an some kind an agent type and should have a possibility to be installed in Linux VMs.
 All the traceroute results should be able to be seen in some kind of one centralized location
  
Maybe someone could recommend tool for that ? It could commercial or free. Till now I've been using the product called Pingplotter - it allows you to install remote agents in your DC and see the results in centralized location. But that remote agent traceroute capability is quite legacy one and not supported anymore - so there're bugs which is annoying. Also - they have a new product called Pingplotter Cloud - that should do the job - but the pricing model is different, will gonna try the trial version. Also - i would like to get some input from you - if there're other tools for that job. Thanks !!

 Two systems with identical group policy settings.
 Event log behaviour is differenct between Windows 10 and Windows 11
 The setting is question is Event Viewer > Windows Logs > Security > right-click > Properties

 Windows 11 defaults to "Do not overwrite events"
 This is a problem because when security event log fills up, system won't accept non-administrative logons.
 Running gpresult /h , the only event log settings I can see are
 Settings/Policies/Windows Settings/Security Settings/Event Log
 and there's nothing relevant here: both are set to 'retain by days' and 'retain for 30 days'.
 Does any one have any ideas?

 can i get windows users & passwords in a text file?
  
I'm a junior dev at a small startup, so I'm doing a lot of stuff I know basically nothing about. We got these small servers called zima boards, and I think they're supposed to be endpoints to kiosks and stuff, maybe get sensor data or shit like that idk they just threw me a box, rattled on about some bullshit I didn't understand(I heard mqtt so it's probably gonna be stuff like that) and said "have fun". I know they said "we need to get windows on it because the users and passwords would be a burden to change" or something like that, and I heard a conversation which mentioned that we're gonna be doing like 50 of these at a time, so I'm guessing my task is to figure out how to install windows on these without having to interact with each one first.
 My second question to anyone who knows windows, is it possible to get the users & passwords in a text file? That would mean we wouldn't have to install windows to begin with, and since it comes with a debian based distro we can just bash some bullshit together to create the users.
 oooh wait, is it possible to run a script with grub(somehow, haven't done it before) to get it to boot there? If so, then I could just run a script to install grub(if not installed), reboot, then run a script which selects the device(maybe? idk all the commands to do that but it seems reasonable right?)

 The output for the Edge plugin shows a path, implying that the plugin looks in certain directories for Edge installations - but does it ony search through "C:\Program..." or does it search the whole drive for any installations of Edge? 
 Similarly, the Apache plugin outputs a URL "http://abc.def/:80" with the port, suggesting that's where the server instance is hosting a web-page. But does it only query the web-page and pull the Apache version that way or is there more going on under the hood?
 I'm not able to find any .nasl script files for these plugins either, so if you could point me to a resource where these exist, that'd help too.

 Currently the main network infrastructure consists of a 2921 series router (cisco) and two procurve switches. I've got the ability to put different devices into different vlans obviously, but I've done a little bit of research and determined that it's possible to break out of it, pretty easily.
 Is there a proprietary solution available for this, or is there a better solution using readily available networking principles to achieve it?

 I'd like to avoid paying thousands of dollars, especially since I don't have many clients yet, AND I already have hardware that's likely better than the hardware in their WiFi-Spy device.
 I've tried normal SDR apps, but you can usually only see about 20MHz at a time, because it's trying to capture the signal at real-time, which isn't needed for diagnosing Wi-Fi.
 Someone's gotta have done this already, right?!

When the user is trying to save the attachment Outlook hangs for a bit or completely crashes, same with Excel - user sometimes cannot even put anything in a row/line, the app just hangs.Right now I'm trying to figure something out, I thought maybe you guys had similiar problems and maybe some fixes for previous problems would work this time around.We tried both repairing and reinstalling the Office, turning off hardware acceleration in Outlook, deleting outlook profile, starting outlook as admin, launching outlook without addons, disabling "scroll inactive windows..." option, increasing the allowed cache file size. No improvements unfortunately. OS in most cases is Windows 11 however the problem started around a week or two ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all!
 I have been reading a lot about PKI and moreover Active Directory Certification Services.
 I have some questions:
 - What is the difference between OCSP and CDP? What is the best scenario to have one or the other?
 - Does OCSP respond if the current client certificate is valid? Is this statement valid for regular CRL CDP as well? How do clients knows to check the ocsp? Is it embedded on the certificate as an AIA point?
 - I have noticed that when setting up the AIA you always point it to the root CA certificate, why is that? Regular CDP point to .crl files but not AIA.
 - If I don't set up a custom IIS server with CRL, do clients pull it from default points such as LDAP? is IIS custom CDP best practice for DMZ external clients where LDAP is not accessible? why CRLs cannot be accessed through HTTPS?
 - What is the objective of using multiple SANs in a certificate?
 - What are the considerations when migrating CAs to other servers? Does it work by backing up old CA, turn off the server CA, create the new one, install role, restore CA registry backup but manitaining IP and server name? Would that keep the default CDP and AIA settings as well as matching DNS zone records. What about the IIS servers hosting enrollment and CDPs if any? What about the NDES role if it is present?
 - Can I change renewal key lenght on capolicy.inf if certificates are required to increase key length? Is there another way to do it? What tasks are needed to be done after that?
 - What is Certificate Transparency what are CT logs? How does ADCS implements it?
 What is a CAA NS record, and how does Microsoft implements it in DNS or ADCS?
 I'd be thanking anyone who can help on answerings these questions as I am really curious about the topic.

 To image the devices we usually boot to an "active disk image" USB and plug our external hard drive that contains the image.
 The issue we have is that we cannot select the internal SSD as the destination disk, although this has worked on previous Dell computers. The first thought it that it would be related to secure boot but i have had no success after turning this off.
 If anyone could point me in the right direction that would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am building a file downloader using c# httpclient which downloads files from an asp.net IIS server. My test is downloading 46GB of data spread out over about 40k files, done by about 4k instances of the downloader process (this is done in a build system, so each instance of the downloader is run/cached separately,). This works out to an average of 10 files downloaded per httpclient instance and an.average of 1MB per file.
 Everything works fine until minute 4, when suddenly my download speed goes to 0. I have a timeout of 1 minute on the process and 5 attempts are made to download each file. About 2 minutes after the stalled downloads, it starts back up again. This is after the first two attempts timed out. The server logs show that it didn't even seem to receive the request that was being asked of it, and when it did receive a request, the server claims it handled it quickly.
 So far to troubleshoote I have tried to increase the dynamic port range, and limit the number of requests being sent at once to 75. Still this happens pretty deterministically around the 3-5 minute mark.
 Is there something I can check and try to figure out why it is stalling? I know Wireshark can be a useful tool, but I don't really know what I am looking for in this case. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I run a small WISP and am moving to Mikriotik HAP line for user routers. I have a big goal to eventually set up a mechanism to redirect past due clients to a "Hey, pay your bill" web page.
 Originally, I was trying to make this a function of DHCP with classes for user MACs that are active or suspended. Active clients will be given an IP on a subnet that is allowed out via NAT permit policy, wheras suspended MACs would be placed on a subnet not allowed out to the internet and has all DNS queries pointing to the IP of my web server (via bind9 views one using normal DNS forwarding and the other pointing to a local dnsmasq instance) with rewrite rules to my "pay your bill" page.
 This ALMOST worked, but when you have multiple IPs on one VLAN, one IP must be the primary IP and that put a halt to anything working. This was because the relay agent will always use the primary IP for the relay agent IP to determine which pool to grant an IP from. I can get a device from active to suspended if the suspended IP is the default, but it will not go back since the relay agent IP will always be the primary IP on the VLAN.
 This led me to consider RADIUS, since you can use Framed-IP-Address to reassign an IP.
 I have a working baseline FreeRADIUS server set up that accepts usernames, passwords and secrets and correctly responds. It is backed by MySQL. I can figure out mac-auth and the rest but I need to know how to make the HAPs authenticate themselves once they get on the network.
 The imagined flow would be DHCP on the primary (suspended) subnet. Radius processes if the MAC is active or not. If it is not it will stay on the suspended subnet. If the MAC is active RADIUS will provide an IP on the secondary (active) subnet.
 Is there a way to make what I am aiming for work?

 If I have a single DC on 2012 OS, with 2008 r2 functional level forest/domain, and I’d like to add a secondary DC (to replace one that recently failed), I don’t see a place in the instruction steps where he functional level is specified when adding the second DC. I’m assuming that this is bc the second dc will just replicate off the first one, but is this a safe assumption? 
 I’ve learned not to assume much when working with MS, so I looked for docs online that specified whether this is fine going from, say, the current OS-functional level combo to, say, 2016 OS with the same 2008 r2 functional level, but I can’t seem to find it. At some point with the newer os’s, won’t I encounter one(like 2019, 2022?) that won’t recognize or allow the new server to become a secondary dc to the existing primary one running such an old functional level? TIA!

 I got some reports one our our remote networks has been running a little slow. 
 I ran a packet monitor on the locations SonicWall and saw an insane amount of ARP requests, all coming from the same MAC which I've identified as the Modem for that location. The ARP requests are NOT for our network, so the SonicWall is dropping them. All of the ARP requests are sourced and destined for IP's in our ISP's range (WOW). In about 30 seconds we'll drop a little over 5000 ARP packets. I was originally investigating an OSPF issue when I found this. Could this be a routing issue on our part, or does this seem like the ISP is at fault? I've called them twice now and its been very unhelpful. 
 Thanks in advance. I appreciate any help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello admins, after the first few years in the job, I am currently considering how I can organize myself better. I know there are various tools, but somehow this is not really effective so far. I sometimes find it difficult to focus and "forget" something that I only remember some time later. The goal is better time management. It works so far rather semi well. Information/tasks come via various channels and I would like to manage this for myself in one tool(best cross platform). 
 Tried Task,ToDo,OneNote,Google Keep…. but hasn't really worked for me so far.
 Now the question to you, what and how do you use tools to organize your daily work and projects and not lose focus?
 Thank you all and have a nice Sunday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That's my job, literally my entire job. 
 Just spent 13 hrs yesterday trying to migrate never patched VMs from 2013 and get them to boot up on Azure. Not just that the client wants their disks to be BitLocker encrypted, that was 6 hrs of screen-sharing & logs sharing with the Critical Situation support team from Azure. 
 All this in a fixed time-frame, if a VM doesn't migrate - it has direct monetary impact on the project. Which leads to every hour updates, extreme levels of micro-management; hell the only time I got up was to piss, 3 times in 13 hrs. 
 My team is made up of 4 recent graduates(almost good for nothing at the moment), 1 team lead who disappears when he is needed, 2 engineers who can't write a single line of powershell if their life depended on it. And then there's me, I have written SOPs for every single action that needs to be performed, have automated over 120 minutes worth of manual configurations; I lead the migration, fix other's mistakes, deal with app owners and their bs expectations. I deal with the curt/narcissitic MDs of my company, while my manager makes sure everything "looks good", because things need not be good, they just gotta look good.
 tldr; V2V/server rehosting is stupid, do not do it. Just build a new VM and install your shit on it.

 I recently read in an article, that ISPs could determine if the user uses tethering, so if the packet originated from a PC/Laptop rather than from the phone itself because the phone would use a different TTL than the connected device.
 Is this true? Would my phone use a different TTL for its packets than my Linux/MacOS/Windows device? Respectively is the TTL dependent of the used OS?
 Or did the website mean, that my phone would represent another hop in the network so that the packets would have a lower TTL? (Couldn't it just be that the packet went randomly another hop?)

 Your software should support 465 and optionally 587 – implicit TLS via submissions over port 465 is where we're moving to, according to RFC 8314 from 2018.
 Dunno about everyone else, but I was definitely under the impression that STARTTLS on 587 was the widely deployed "better" option. Seems like it's just widely deployed where implicit TLS should be.
 Happy SNI sounds, because multiplexing SMTP traffic sucks otherwise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Friends,
 I work for an IT company and have 15 years of experience in Telecom domain. I worked on various Network Inventory design and Audit projects which were not much technical in nature. The network inventory design involved the various vendors SDH/SONET transport devices, Cisco and Nokia switches and routers.
 I don't have any hands on experience configuring the routers and switches in the live network.
 In my current project, I am responsible to setup E2E test environment (Integration of applications) and physically connect the various DOCSIS cable modems and gateways and fiber ONTs devices in the test lab and auto provision them in ICOMS and backend systems.
 I am doing good in this project and my efforts are highly appreciated by the client managers.
 But then I really don't know what to do next to progress in my career. 
 Recently, I cleared AWS solution architect associate exam.
 I am planning to upskill myself in following areas and would need some geniune advice on what should I do next.
 I have a weakness of not being consistent with my studies or certifications. Back of the mind, I think what is the use of doing certifications if there is no real practical experience and companies prefer to appoint those who have solid hands on experience.
 Please suggest
  
AWS Cloud Security
 Ansible Network Automation
 DevOps
 Dockers, Kubernetes
  
Thank you

 - EPG : Is there any equivalent term or concept in a standalone cisco switch?

 Been in end-user support as a field technician for about 2 years and spoke to my boss about wanting to transition into system admin/active directory and go on the cybersec pathway for climbing up. Company owner agreed to reserve the next trainee position for me and we'll be meeting up next week to be discussing the terms of the position etc.
 For some background, recently I asked the company owner for a letter of good faith to be released to one of our contractees as a employee in an attempt to move upwards, however was turned down for lack of experience, which is where he offered me training and a junior system admin position. He's been very accommodating with me so far and even gave me a raise recently. 
 If anyone could give me their 2 cents and some insight into what I should expect as a junior system admin going from end-user support. that would be cool.

 I'm trying to consolidate consoles a little, at least bring as much as I can into one place.

And a laser beam to scratch my bum from space.
 Closest I've found is Auvik, possibly ManageEngine. Solarwinds ticks most boxes as a solution.. but...well. Not sure I'm ready to forgive on that one...

 When these programs were on-prem, they had very simple passwords as access was only permitted via VPN or no-prem network. When they were moved to cloud, there was no care or concern to change them.
 I have reported these security issues to our IT management and no action was taken.
 FYI, username was simple like admin or administrator and the password was shown on the same page or the default that the vendor has for their clients. Also, these platforms give full admin access and full view of all information, statistics, user privileges, clients etc.
 These cloud platforms run the core functions of our organization and are used by every department (no 2fa, with no password policies, no restrictions and are globally available via subdomain).
 Additionally, our InfoSec team has been aware and have let management know, but no action either. Also when these platforms were migrated, InfoSec was not involved in any step too.
 What do I do (or not do)?

 We have a few thousand mailboxes on Rackspace Email and less than one hundred on Hosted Exchange on the same domain. Rackspace’s temp fix requires us to migrate everyone to M365, but I’m wondering if I could(should?) spin up a new domain for the impacted Exchange mailboxes only.
 They’d be fresh mailboxes, but it might buy us the time needed to recover from the attack. Migrating a few thousand healthy mailboxes seems like a bad idea just to save less than one hundred.
 I’m not taking any action until I’m able to speak with them. Left a callback request with support, but no response yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A noobie question, but should I enable indexing of encrypted files in Windows 10 if my indexed drives are encrypted with Bitlocker? Since all files on those drives are encrypted, then it should be enabled, right?
 But it is disabled by default. Am I misunderstanding what the setting does?
 Thanks!

Everyone unsurprisingly slept through the alerts. Powered down our SAN earlier this morning. With only a couple switches, firewalls, and some phone stuff, still 93f in there.

 My EdgeSwitch at work is telling me that there are two devices plugged into Port 1 and Port 2, and that they are using PoE and they are sending/receiving data, but the Mac table doesn't seem to know what the IP addresses are. 
 Can anyone explain to me what I might be seeing here? I feel like I'm in patch panel hell right now trying to figure out where all these unlabeled cables go.

 Alternative question, Will you listen to Jazz again & What are your lessons learned? It's always important to learn from our mistakes.
 I'm on 6 hours 10 Hours.
 Lesson learned: The alternative email is a thing... just in case you revolve on a password reset for admin creds during a mass outage.
