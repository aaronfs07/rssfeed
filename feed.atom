I'll be honest that part of it is on me: in the past year, I've lost a brother, been hospitalized twice, had my wife hospitalized, father with a quad-bypass, mother very recently with a stint replacement, and a minor family member we've had to coach through some life-altering nonsense that I'd rather not repeat. So, yeah, I've been a little out-of-pocket this year, and that's on me. 
 I got this guy not only his job, but his position, then he did an end-run around me with an outgoing C-level exec to get team lead, and due to a manpower shortage at the time, fell into management. I was honestly okay with all of that, because I knew the guy was A-list material; I wouldn't have gone to bat for him otherwise. Also, fuck management... in 25 years of this, I've never wanted to be one, so more power to those who do. 
 So, here I am... trying my best to be cordial with a guy who has from day one of having access to payroll been upset that I make more than him, while he's talking to me like the goddamned godfather, filling a position I had the opportunity to leave at least five times, now trying to get out-from-under before I get fired or PIP'd into a corner, all while trying not to be the asshole who fracks off without leaving documentation. 
 Sigh... I was honestly hoping to be able to retire at this one. Ten years with an employer is a pretty good stint, in my book.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the last week, there's been 4 major attacks affecting certain social agencies and NGO's, i've been curiosly following these stories and one culprit that keeps popping up is 'MFA Fatigue' , in an attempt to secure our infrastructure or reduce chances of falling prey to some of these attacks, i've been implementing a handful of measures/policies, most of which i actually learnt from here through various posts and responses.
 In the wake of this, i have a few questions or concerns that i'm hoping to get some feedback on how you all handle this in your organizations.
  
how do you deal with MFA fatigue? by preventing MFA from prompting via push notification but rather require the user open the App and fill in the code? this way if you aren't logging in anywhere, you won't have the need to open the app?
 how do you also handle Atypical travel? blocking IP or setting strict account lockout threshold?
 is SSPR adviceable? or does it grant an attacker an added option to gain full control?
  
I already did research most this via google and Microsoft learn...so as the attackers. i was just wondering if there are any other methods apart from the obvious of dealing with these attacks.
 ​
 thanks.

The tunnel connects our US and China offices. Trouble is, I've never been able to explain why. To get it back I usually have to failover to our backup ISP in the US office (and fail back to the primary again) and it will come back up.
 There are other occasions when the tunnel from China to our other offices (also in Asia) fails so the common theme is China. What's the likely reason? Could it just be the great FW in China having an impact? We use Check Point firewalls - happy to learn something new!

 I've been a bit of an idiot and i didnt realize that Windows 10 had version 22H2. I assumed that was Windows 11 and onwards. My site of around 300 machines are all running 21H2 so from my understanding i can upgrade via the enablement package. 21H2 have support until the middle of next year so no immediate rush.
 I want to push this out to a few machines to test, i use WSUS and client side targetting so applying this to individual machines can be a pain as i would have to setup a new GPO to target a new client side group.
 I was wondering if its possible to get hold of the files and push it out via PDQ instead? I notice it says they are not available from the Windows Update catalogue though.
 Has anyone else used the enablement package outside of WSUS some how and managed to upgrade machines?
 Appreciate any advice

 Quite a few months ago (Or maybe even last year), we had a case of Conficker on one of our client's DCs. Back then, I thought I completely removed the thing, since it was coming from an old XP machine, made it's way to the DC and didn't really do anything else, since it was so effing old. I used ZenMap, to, supposedly, find all remains and remove them, but now I've gotten a notice, that the disk-space for C:\ is getting low. I checked to find Sophos Endpoint Agent creating snapshot files by the hour, because it kept finding and deleting the same file in Sys32, that is being generated by some mysterious Conficker Virus remains. 
 I checked online, but didn't get any real results, just some general tips, on how to remove Conficker. Now, I'm not really experienced, when it comes to malware and viruses, so I don't know, where to start, that's why I'm turning to your expertise again. If you need more info, please go ahead and ask, and I'll provide any necessary info.
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I work for an employer with a number of different sites. The organization's main office is moving from one location with multiple one-story buildings to a seven-story office building over the next year or two. Until now, our scheme for data has mostly followed 10.111.X.Y, with X being an arbitrary VLAN ID associated with a specific department and Y being the host. VoIP has typically mirrored that but with a VLAN ID equal to X + 100 (i.e. VLAN 50's voice VLAN is 150), and wireless has been a single VLAN across the entire organization. 
 At our new building, we are tentatively planning on sticking with 10.111.X.Y, but with X being an arbitrary VLAN associated with the floor, not the department. The idea is to hopefully simplify management on our end since there will be multiple departments per floor but only one switch stack. We're planning on the same voice VLAN scheme. We're undecided on whether to do a single wireless subnet or one per floor. We're also considering adding another VLAN schema (like X + 200) for various maintenance devices on each floor of the new building, like cameras, HVAC equipment, etc.
 Does this all make sense? Is there a more efficient way of doing this? What's worked in your experience? We don't have too large a number of end users or devices, but we figure if there was ever a time to adjust our addressing it would be now. As a side note, what is standard practice for VPN pools? Right now we are using a completely random range (10.100.20.x). Would it make more sense to use something in the 10.111.x range? Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

 My previous position had me in DevOps engineering where I was able to master Kubernetes, Helm, CI/CD, and Infrastructure-as-code best practices. Unfortunately due to various reasons I reached that "burn-out" point where I was underpaid and overwhelmed with the work being requested of me, so I found a new position earlier this year, working in media.
 A few months in, the transition between the two environments has been, well.. extreme.
 Pros: Finally getting paid what I'm worth, in an industry more to my liking, with less responsibility!
 Cons: Mostly Windows environment (few hundred servers, mostly bare-metal), no documentation aside from a handful of spreadsheets, inconsistent communication within the department, no one's even heard of a code repository before, management is very resistant to change. 
 I'm someone who's done all the DevOps things and enjoys doing them when the workloads are reasonable. This is the path I want to grow in as (from what I can tell) the world is moving more towards microservice/IaaS models. 
 Am I in the right for wanting to gracefully push the place more towards modern standards? or should I just accept that this is the culture in the new industry and maybe this position isn't a good fit after all?

 I have a set of GS meraki go switches and GR wireless APs on which I’m trying to configure VLANs for GUEST network. I have a Firewalla which i set up in router mode but it doesn’t seem like i can configure VLANs on my Meraki GO equipment without a GX router. Is that correct?

 Initially all replication are doing well. 
 Recently start popping error of sysvol failed to replicate followed by AD changes not showing on PDC despite DFS, repadmin, dcdiag and dfsdiag not showing any error at all. 
 Currently clueless on what to do. 
 PDC is hosted on AWS. Built fron scratch on Server 2019.
 Member server are Server 2016 which u will call SDC1 & SDC2
 Additional info.
 Sync between SDC1 and SDC2 are doing fine.
 Tried performing repadmin /syncall /AdeP and replicate from option in ADSS on PDC but still not showing latest changes (new computer object and user creation)
 UPDATE 1: If i perform repadmin /syncall on PDC it goes straight to syncall finished without showing the usual replication is in progress information.
 Update 2: will temporary put it as solved. As i realize its Inter-Site and not Intra-Site hence the default replication timing is 3 hours. But will keep a look out if problem still shows will do a ADFS restore.

 Network Engineer for Municipal ISP. We currently have a /23 and /22 from ARIN. I'm planning for when we need more addresses. There are several options and I'd like to ask your opinion to see what your experiences have been.
 We could go down the road of CGNAT. Very expensive and we are a small shop with no experience with this technology.
 NAT6to4 seems easy enough to configure, but I worry about to scalability and robustness.
 We also have the option to lease additional /20 IP space for ~ 0.20c and IP per year with a 5 year term. Cheap, but not a long term solution.
 Then there is the option of getting IPv6 space form ARIN and using IPv6 exclusively. Without complete internet adoption of IPv6 I worry about routing and reachability issues to organizations that aren't at least dual stacked.
 What are your thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All this talk about how the November CU update was breaking domain authentication in environments where RC4 was explicitly disabled via group policy sent me down a rabbit hole.
 My environment wasn't affected, but it made me curious about WHY so many have disabled RC4. TLDR; it's less secure than AES256.
 Step 1) audit your domain controllers for RC4 in use. Just replace DC01 with the name of your domain controller. 0x17 events means RC4 is being used.
 Get-WinEvent -LogName 'Security' -ComputerName 'DC01' -FilterXPath "*[System[EventID=4769] and EventData[Data[@Name='TicketEncryptionType']='0x17']]" 
 What this uncovered is that Azure AD Connect for hybrid environments was using RC4 (it creates a computer object called AZUREADASSOACC). I guess the reason for this was that until sometime in 2020 AES wasn't supported?? So if you use Azure AD Connect, you might want to look into this to improve security.
 Anyway, this article nicely outlines the steps needed to get Azure AD Connect using AES https://azuregeek.io/en/secure-azure-ad-sso-and-disable-rc4-hmac/?q=%2Fen%2Fsecure-azure-ad-sso-and-disable-rc4-hmac%2F
 After following these steps & rolling over my Kerberos decryption keys I now see Azure AD SSO now using AES (0x12 in the event log)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just ran into WU failing to install some updates with 0x800f0922 error code.
 Googled it and these failures are fairly common, but the "solutions" are all over the place. The most common one is to disable secure boot in the BIOS. Another one from this thread is to enable AppReadiness service. Plus the regular assortment of "sfc /scannow" and "dism /restorehealth" voodoo, and all the way up to updating BIOS and what not.
 The PSA is this - all of this is nonsensical. 0x800f0922 is a generic error meaning "the installer failed".
 To understand the cause you need to skim though %WinDir%\Logs\CBS\CBS.log and find the first error that then triggers a cascade of failures culminating in 0x800f0922.
 In our case it was that ... drumroll ... %System32%\Macromed\Flash directory was missing. Created it, re-run updates - et voila - all updates went through.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an HP L3 switch connected to a Cisco L3 switch and am in the process of migrating SVIs. They are connected via 2x10G links in an LACP port-channel. This trunk carries a number of VLANs. There are devices hanging off of the Cisco switch with the HP core still handling the routing, and that all works fine.
 I created a test VLAN on each switch and added it to the trunk on both ends, with the intention of testing the SVI on the Cisco switch and only L2 on the HP side. I don't know if it's coincidence that this is happening with the test VLAN, but I can't get the test VLAN to pass any traffic across the trunk. Devices connected to the Cisco switch can talk to the SVI, but anything on the other side of the trunk can't connect. I've done variations of testing and essentially, any devices on that test VLAN can talk to each other unless they are physically located on the other side of the trunk. I've moved the SVI to the HP side and anything on HP side is now able to talk to the SVI and anything on Cisco can no longer talk to it.
 If I run a packet capture on a device from either side, it sends ARPs and gets no replies, furthering my suspicion that this is just a L2 trunk issue.
 I suspect there is some sort of bug with this VLAN not getting passed because I added it later than other VLANs. I plan to shut and no shut the port on the Cisco switch during a window. I have encountered something similar when using VTP in the past.
 Just wondering if I'm missing something - this seems fairly basic so I'm astounded it's causing such an issue.
 EDIT: No VTP in use. The Cisco switch is a pair of stacked 9500s, and the trunk port is cross-chassis etherchannel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to design a network for a tether to a vehicle. The original plan was to have a tether cable with two single mode fiber cables and have the cables running in full-duplex which is something I have done before. The network is very simple as in the image.
 The problem now is that due to supply issues is that we can only source a tether with a single fiber single mode. I have not set up a network like this before. Is it possible to still set up the same design using half-duplex mode. I have the following questions:
  
What type of media converter do I need to look for? The one I was going to use was https://www.mpl.ch/t2875.html since it needs to be small to fit the vehicle. But I am guessing the 100Base-FX or 1000Base-X are not compatible with half-duplex.
 What type of transceiver/connector would be best to use since I can no longer just use the LC Duplex connector?
 Are there any special considerations for the router/switch that I need to use to support half-duplex the original plan was to use a tiny unmanaged switch. But not I am not so sure that is possible https://botblox.io/products/gigablox-small-gigabit-switch
  
Is my idea still possible or do I need to abandon it now?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've noticed while building out some ansible automation that some of the modules take a very long time to complete runs. The main issue here is that it is slowing down the control plane and affecting some SNMP alerting. The main culprit here is the "no shut" command or rather enabling/disabling ports. 
 I've tried using the ansible module only for enabling ports, as a shutdown command is visible in the configuration and does not run. Templates for the rest of the configurations.
 I've tried using a template to speed up runs, which does help a bit, but still requires applying no shutdown to all ports in a switch stack. This takes a significant amount of time.
 ​
 Has anyone run into this type of problem with automating switch configurations? Should I look at another feature within ansible or perhaps use a separate tool to manage port status (maybe pulling facts? Or using napalm? Direct API commands?) ? I haven't seen anything that will allow the no shutdown command to be present in the configuration, but it would be a nice to have feature.

 I personally needed this for recording a screencast of the process to install Corso. While recording myself going through permission settings in M365, I didn’t want to unintentionally reveal PII for my team members or other sensitive data.
 Another reason to do this is if you’re looking to level up both your skills and want to experiment with being the admin in your own space rather than impacting other users on a production domain. It’s also a good step to experiment with owning your own identity.

Essentially, barracuda has an internal list of senders and IPs it marks as -1000 and does not apply filtering to normally. This is obviously a problem, but if this list was EXTREMELY well curated, it would probably be fine. However, it is not. It whitelists all salesforce IPs for example, even if it's a newly set up gmail etc. There are a lot of ways to exploit this list that I've observed since reporting the issue and just two weeks ago we had something very malicious make it through. I am not going to list every single way in which this list is easily exploited, but if you dig into it on your side you will very quickly see how someone could easily take advantage of it just by knowing it's there …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm working with a company with several small branch offices. They have older Junipers that work as their gateway/firewall/edge router and VPN gateway. I'm trying to swap out these all-in-one appliances slowly, but it doesn't seem like any new VPNs want to connect to the older Junipers. Any advice? It's a hub-and-spoke setup.
 I'm thinking that the best way to proceed is to start in their central office by connecting a new appliance to the old, passing it a single public IP (1to1) at first, then slowly moving over other IPs, the branch VPNs, and services as time and budget permits. Eventually, the new appliance would be doing all the work. At that point, remove the old appliance and plug the new one directly into the ISP's modem. 
 Is there a more common way to work through this scenario? Are there any gotchas? The project is not a rush and I assume it'll take a couple of months to complete. If we were just talking about a few offices, I'd get everything provisioned, take them down on a Friday evening, and be done by the following Monday, but there are just too many branches to coordinate that over a single weekend. Thoughts?

 I’ve spoken to Draytek, they have confirmed to me that they don’t support and are not looking to support 464. We are currently using some TP-link mesh boxes for lab testing though they don’t support 464 either though they are being cagey with me in regards to their roadmap. 
 Budgets are a bit above my pay grade, this is just POC work at the moment. 
 I know that OpenWRT supports it. But that brings a host of issues that I’d rather not have to deal with in a prod environment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So on our network we have a WSA. When people come into our building to use VPNs, we have to add their VPN urls to a bypass list. From my understanding, we do this because we currently don't have any public certs, and it is temporary.
 My question though is about Cisco Anyconnect. Usually we add the url that the VPN connects to but yesterday I ran into an issue. The person who was trying to connect, their any connect box on their screen just had a name of the server they were connecting to, not an IP or url.
 What would be the best way then to find the IP or URL in this case? When we went to the any connect settings , they were all blank because he was not connected.
 Our way of getting it to work was his wife, who was working remotely and also on the same VPN, sent a screen shot of her settings and from there we were able to get the server IP.
 But I am just curious what would have been the best way to find the IP or URL? Is there a file I can look at on the users PC? Like I said, when we went to his any connect settings, they were all blank beacuse he was not connected.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Switches always have a Mpps rating - from small ones to data center ones. Why don't routers have it too? It should be pretty predictable, especially when ASICs are involved. When it comes to firewalls the answer seems obvious - it probably depends on what the firewall is configured to do (and it may do a lot).

 For many months we have been trying like everyone else to strengthen the security of our infrastructure and one of the many, many points to improve is to no longer use the domain administrator (the default one).
 The necessary was done but I noticed that it was still used. After reading the events I found the origin of the problem: a SQL server. Every evening when performing the backup jobs, the following logs appear :
 https://i.postimg.cc/bNnmqtHH/sql.jpg
 I've checked everywhere (in jobs, in SQL Server service accounts) and I don't see our domain admin populated.
 Any idea how to prevent it from being used ? I wonder if SQL Server was installed with this domain admin and if the problem can come from there.
 Thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 So, long story short, we had an ask from our company to take our external contractor AD Users and run Enable-RemoteMailbox on them. We quickly found out that was not what should have been done and they should have had the command, Enable-MailUser run on them as they are external contractors and we simply want to have them as AD Users that have an external email address that mail is resolved to.
 Okay, simple enough I thought. So, I went ahead and ran the following for each user that was affected:
 Disable-RemoteMailbox -Identity <users> -Confirm:$false
 Enable-MailUser -Identity <user> -ExternalEmailAddress <[user@theircompany.com](mailto:user@theircompany.com)>
 We also wanted their Email field in the General tab of AD to match their UPN, so after running the above commands, AND before AAD sync happened (unfortunately) we updated their Email field to match that of their UPN. When we run the Enable-MailUser is makes their Email property their external email address. Well, that appears to have messed up those users where now On-prem they are showing as MailUsers, but in 365 they are showing still as a UserMailbox for RecipientType.
 We are struggling to get this update on both ends. So far, I have tried taking one of the users and running Disable-MailUser, letting that sync over to 365 and then running Enable-MailUser again. No luck. I have tried having the user set up as a MailUser On-prem and then stop syncing them with 365. Once they are no longer synced, I then re-sync them, but again, no luck.
 What's even stranger is we noticed that when we disable them On-prem as a MailUser, and then re-sync them, one property keeps getting written back it would seem from 365 to On-prem...
 Within the user's proxyAddresses, one address shows up. The x500? I'm wondering if I am missing a step here or if something else needs to be updated for these users to finally sync up as a MailUser On-prem as well as in 365? Thanks everyone!

PC's are a mix of Windows 10/11, all installed with Office 365. Whenever we have a new user logon, the system tries to load Outlook 2016 and connect to our old Exchange server (FYI, this is no longer turned on) My question is how does Windows try and load the 2016 version of something that isn't installed and what setting do I need to turn off to stop it trying to connect to old Exchange?
 All our DNS records are correct and pointing to 365. In the interim of swapping systems we had to have an Autodiscover GPO which is now deleted.
 Any help appreciated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I've inherited an AD with company.com as internal AD domain as well es external domain name. Right now the external records (e.g. www.company.com) are just placed inside the default "company.com" zone inside the AD DNS.
 Is there currently any Best Practise way to keep external records automatically up2date inside the AD zone?
 There might be some way to automate this with powershell (lookup external records and set internal records accordingly) but this feels a bit too hacky.
 Best case would be to tell AD to lookup the records on the external DNS if the internal DNS does not have any records. As far as I understand by default AD doesn't forward those requests since only the internal DNS is authoritative for "company.com"?
 It's probably not as simple as adding the external name server to "Properties -> Nameserver" on the AD I guess?
 Is there any way around this problem or do you just have to live with manually maintaining those external records on the internal DNS?
 I've also seen you can do zone transfers from AD to a specific server. Could you instead do a zone transfer from external to internal? (Without it overwriting all the internal records)
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Auditing Teams membership changes can help admins ensure that only authorized individuals have access to sensitive information. By regularly auditing membership changes, organizations can identify and address any potential security risks.
 Since Audit log search has limited customization, I have written a PowerShell script to track Teams membership changes with advanced capabilities.
 You can download the script from GitHub.
 Script Highlights:
  
The script uses modern authentication to retrieve audit logs.
 Exports all the teams’ membership changes
 The script has a filter to track private channel membership changes separately.
 It has a filter to monitor shared channel membership changes separately.
 Allows you to generate an audit report for a custom period.
 It can be executed with an MFA enabled account too.
 Exports report results to CSV file.
 Automatically installs the EXO V2 module (if not installed already) upon your confirmation.
 The script is scheduler-friendly. I.e., Credentials can be passed as a parameter instead of saved inside the script.
  
If you have any suggestion or additional requirements, I will update them in the next version.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, there are a few posts on the web regarding this question, but all of them are 5+ years old without any usable solution...
 To keep it short- We have Active Directory in our company, with 300+ machines, of which ~50 are laptops.
 We have bad practices in the company - most of the laptop users don't bring laptops to the company (thus not connecting to the company LAN, not updating group policy, and some custom software) for long periods of time.
 The general idea is to FORCE them to bring laptops to the company once in a while (every 15-20 days) by automatically expiring their cached domain credentials after X days or X logins. Since M$ till this day doesn't offer any option to achieve this, I am wondering if maybe somebody had a similar situation and if there maybe is some workaround to achieve this?
 We have VPN (Checkpoint), but also can't force users to use it (also no option to keep it constantly connected- which by itself is also bad idea because there would be a lot of incoming traffic on servers).

I'm really happy about this, considering that I fell in love with it. Recently, we had some internal "problems" with the cybersec team (which is not in the IT dept anymore), and the question of the day is "who should do what?" Now that a lot of stuff has been migrated in the Purview portal, I think it's harder to identify who should have access to it and, in particular, define all the permissions. I think both the exchange admin and the security admin should have access to the portal, and it's mandatory that both the part talks before making any changes. What do you think/how do you handle this in your company?

 I have a new client who is still running SBS 2011 (I know, I know..), thankfully Exchange has been decommissioned and they are on 365 for mail. So it's basically just an old file server which needs to be replaced at some stage with something modern.
 However they still use the Remote Desktop facility built into SBS2011. They would like to keep this if possible or some new variation of it. Is it still supported in newer versions of Windows Server?
 Thanks for any advice

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Mostly we use windows ltsc. We had some windows 10 pro computers and after upgrading computers to 21h1, some computers started to have problem when outlook tries connect Exchange server (we use 2016). It shows disconnected.
 I saw a reddit topic and and question topic to microsoft with same problem. But there is no solution.
 Only fix 
  
close outlook
 disable other network adapters
 open again outlook (outlook connects)
 enable network adapters again
  
Is there anyone who faced this problem and found solution.
 Thanks.

 I am currently trying to implement a MFA Solution for the company I work with. While Fido2 works just fine on a Desktop Enviroment to secure the M365 access it's utterly useless when the User has to work on a Terminal Server, because the Server does (for whatever reason) not recognise the Key so the User can't login into their M365 while working on the Terminal Server.
 And sadly mandating the Authenticator App on the private phone of an employee is not possible (legally), so I am looking for a solution that works on Terminal Servers to secure the M365 access.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My environment either needs a local repo or just to proxy the apt packages. The main repo server will be the only one able to go out to the web, everything else has to point at it for their packages/updates.
 100% ubuntu environment with server and desktop
 I've played with aptly in the past but the process of having to do the mirrors/snapshots and publishing and everything can be a bit of a hassle to update the repos often. Not major gripe but it's just something.
 Apt-cacher-ng as a proxy seems promising as well. Haven't used it but pretty straight forward.
 Would it be better to just utilize the proxy instead of storing an entire mirror of all ubuntu repos locally? I feel it would be, since that would be a huge waste of space if we only use maybe 20% of the actual packages in the repo. Not going to waste time figuring out exactly what packages each system uses but if we utilize the proxy then it can cache what's needed and other systems can just grab from there if it's cached and cut down on network traffic going out.
 One main concern is being able to freeze the updates/packages so that we can update our test string, verify it works and then update the prod string with the same package versions and everything.
 Obvious workaround is just to take note of package version #s when we do the update to test string but while doable that would be annoying for some of the admins i'm sure and I want this as simple as possible.
 Is there a way to set apt-cacher-ng to have 2 cache directories?

 They did a firewall update Sunday night and I noticed the problem Monday morning. It took them until Monday noon to resolve this, the website failed to work properly. This is unacceptable. Losing customers for a SaaS product :(
 Which hosting are you using? Who in the world does this job best? Uninterrupted service and fast support in case of a problem are important.
 I don't believe in the "best hostings of 2022" articles, the best ones usually depend on how much you pay the company that wrote that article :)

My shift would be over before I find out that the image failed so troubleshooting is very tedious!
 Anyway, any imaging/switching experts can offer any advice? I think this is a job for multicast but I’m not too familiar. We use Aruba 6300 switches. The vlan they’re using has igmp snooping and pim-sparse configured. If there’s a quick and dirty fix I’ll take it! If there’s something in the ghost software I need to tweak I’m all for it! Anything to avoid using a clean switch and cabling everything to it (that’s their idea btw)

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month's updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft's Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft's updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work.
 Test, test, and test!

I'd be working with one other network guy who is more junior (guy just got his CCNA)
 Small offices and locations peppered around the US. Fortinet, Sonicwall, Meraki, Dell storage, Meraki/Fortinet wireless, with Microsoft Hyper V. Not too terribly complicated from what I can tell.
 They don't have any monitoring AFAIK, so I'll be helping them build out that infrastructure there.

 So I have been working for a company as a Help Desk Analyst i went in as a contractor and most recently i have been made full time my manager put me on a slack call with him and he told me the news 
 Before all this happened he knew for a while that i want to be a system administrator it has been my dream job he asked our director who runs the system administration team and he told my manager to tell me that he is not looking for anyone new at the moment 
 after he told me that he went on to say that I will be training you once a week and i told him that is very generous of you because he has a very busy schedule my manager is our service desk manager and he also does system administration
 I just want to know after all the training is “done” what happens to me because my manager went on to tell me that if my director does need a system administrator it won’t be for 2 to 3 years obviously he is just guessing and doesn’t know for sure. 
 I am really appreciative of the fact my manager is gonna trian me and i will get to learn and leverage my skills but i am young i don’t want to be in help desk for another second and i definitely do not want to wait 2 to 3 years to become system administrator 
 I am sorry for the long speech i just want to know after all the training is “done” what happens after? 
 also my manager told me “don’t worry you definitely will not stay in help desk” he tells me i am very ambitious.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. Would love thoughts/opinions on the best devices or type of devices or service. I have recently started at a small but growing enterprise. Company has 4 locations in the US and 3 in Asia. 3 locations have 200-300 users each and the rest are tiny. One of the larger sites hosts a single public facing application, accessed by our partners, nothing else is hosted publicly in the enterprise services (with the exception of client VPN). The rest have users mostly accessing Office 365, other SaaS applications and a smattering of internal applications. So far the long term goals of the company are:
  
To ideally consolidate all sites on a single platform - not a hard requirement if something else makes sense but right now it's a hodge podge and current gear is up for renewal and/or end of life. Everything is basic firewalls right now, no NGFW/UTM/SWG etc.
 To implement a greater degree of filtering/inspection/prevention/reporting and to ultimately integrate with an EDR/XDR platform for better visibility.
 To ideally eliminate our MPLS in favor of an SD-WAN, with redundant ISP's in each location
 To move all server workloads, including the single public facing app, to public cloud
  
The security vendor who my boss (CIO) has a relationship with is pushing him to buy their EDR/XDR platform along with their UTM's in every location. This is running a pretty high price tag and causing him to think about whether he can afford two for every location to have redundancy/fail over. I have a good networking foundation but my background is more on the server and storage side. At this point I am thinking that these UTM's at each location may be overkill for users surfing the internet. I am thinking there might be better/more cost effective alternatives. Or whether a hosted solution like zScaler or a competitor would be more cost effective. Ideally whatever solution we choose should have some way to integrate with an XDR platform.
 WWYD?
 thanks

 I am a lab equipment technician, and ran into a configuration I was unfamiliar with today and was wondering if some here might be able to help me understand a bit better. My networking knowledge is probably about a 4 out of 10. 
 We have an analyzer that processes patient samples and sends that data to an information management system. Normally its all TCP/IP, which allows me to easily switch the analyzer between communicating with a production server and a test server by switching the IP and PORT (which are both static). However I ran into one today that was configured with an ethernet to RS232 adapter. 
 Basically, 
 Analyzer(and analyzer PC) > Lantronix Box > Management System. 
 Parallel to that, 
 Analyzer(and analyzer PC)>Firewall>client network>analyzer diagnostic report exports to a website I can access from home. 
 I was just wondering what the purpose of running a seperate RS232/TCP/IP converter to the management system would be, if the analyzer and management system could be ran all via TCP/IP (which is what I normally see). 
 I tried to keep it concise without being too vague, but if there are more details I should include please let me know. 
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is a link to the original.
 So I set up a meeting with my boss and I fumbled through a shitty 2 weeks notice. I told him I’m leaving. I didn’t want to hurt the guys feelings so I told him I need to be remote to be able to support my family more which is true but mainly I was sick of the constant lack of support while being handed project after project while trying to be an entire IT department for a large organization. 
 I kid you not I got the 5 stages of grief from him.
 In no particular order:
 Denial- what do you mean? Your not putting in your 2 weeks notice are you?
 Anger- There is no way I am going to be able to replace you by the deadline! Who gave you an offer? How much?
 Bargaining- Would you stay if gave you 5 grand? Can you please stay until march, I’ll let you work from home! We can work with you. Please let me work with you!
 Depression- I thought we were friends. I can take care of you. Give me a chance please! 
 Acceptance- you’ll want to hand in a formal notice of resignation if this is what you really want. 
 I didn’t want to tell him I accept an offer anywhere else but he kept patronizing me by telling me that money is gonna be tight and shit so i finally told him I got an offer somewhere else that gives me more freedom. He kept fucking grilling me to give him a chance to do good by me but it just felt weird. I told him I’d sleep on it cause I felt bad but I told him not to expect me to change my mind. Now he’s fucking texting me outside of work saying he spoke with the ceo so they can “make it work” for me to work remotely most of the time.
 TLDR; Gave 2 weeks notice and tried to be nice by focusing on a personal priority of mine instead of telling my boss what i really think and it back fired. 
 I’m handing in a formal resignation tomorrow hopefully it’s all just acceptance from there out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings. I'm struggling with creating an IPSEC connection between colocated server running Debian 11 and KVM/QEMU.
 It seems there's something "mysterious" about the virbr0 interface. I have a tunnel created using Strongswan IPSEC but it really only works in one direction. It acts like a firewall issue, but I've tried many things that make me believe it's more of a fundamental limitation of QEMU/Libvirt/virbr0.
 I've have created several tunnels with Strongswan, but this roadblock has me stumped.
 Has anyone successfully created an IPSEC tunnel with KVM host using strongswan and the default virbr0 network? I'd like to have my VMs reachable over the IPSEC tunnel and also allow the VMs to reach my local LAN.
 I can reach the VMs without issue, but I can't connect from the VM to my local LAN. I noticed the issue when trying to connect two KVM hypervisors over the internet with Strongswan IPSEC. I've been running Strongswan to connect to my VMs in the cloud for over a year, but never realized the tunnel really doesn't work in the other direction (other than ping/ICMP works).
 The basic oddity is like this: I can ping a remote LAN host over the tunnel, but if I run traceroute, it tries to go to the public interface first, which leads me to believe it's a limitation of virbr0.
 If anyone would like to help, here are my iptables on the kvm host.
 Local LAN = 192.168.7.0.24
 Remote virbr0/KVM LAN = 192.168.222.0/24
 Here's the strongswan config.
 I think the workaround is to create a tunnel using Wireguard, but I hate being defeated and would really like to learn what I'm doing wrong or not understanding.
 Thanks in advance to anyone willing to contribute.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yep, the heading is the TL;DR.
 I recently purchased a SonicWall TZ270 for the family business as there was no sort of security infrastructure before. This is replacing what was just a basic home router.
 Ever since the firewall was implemented, there has been intermittent internet connectivity happening roughly 3x an hour lasting from 10 seconds-2 minutes. edit: closer to 5 minutes.
 ​
 Here is the current configuration:
 X0 - LAN 192.168.0.x
 X1 - WAN
 X3 - DEV 192.168.7.x
 X4 - SRV 192.168.5.x
 DHCP and DNS are on a Windows Server on the SRV network with IP Helper on the SonicWall. No issues with either of those.
 Ports are open for 2 services on 2 different servers - configured with wizard.
 ​
 Diagnosing:
 - Confirmed there are no duplicate DHCP or DNS servers
 - Disabled failover probing (known SW issue)
 - Ran packet traces
 - Pinged internal IP's, external IP's, internal hostnames, external hostnames for info
 - Reset to factory defaults, reconfigured as bare-metal as possible
 ​
 It looks like when the internet connectivity drops, I lose access to the WAN, both hostnames and IP's, but not anything on the internal network. I managed to catch the drop on 1 packet trace on the firewall and it dropped nearly 400 packets in a split second, all blaming either multicast not being configured, or something on the wrong subnet (known issue with this ISP).
 ​
 Is there ANYTHING else I can check? Or do I throw this out and just get a Sophos?

 Not the worst description I've seen, but still very unhelpful. Not sure why it's so hard for users to provide any details. Is this a file from a website? Some internal application? Elsewhere? Are you using a browser? Which one? Are there any error messages? At the very least, can you provide a phone number that I can call to talk to you to get this information?
 I gently responded to the ticket asking for more details (including some prompts to make it easier). Crickets.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have been racking my brain and researching this issue for about a week now. Sorry if this doesn't fit here.
 The issue I've been having, is that from a oracle cloud ampere server (with a 4 Gbps link) located about 1200 km away, with 34 ms of latency, I cannot seem to get more than about 100 Mbps to my local connection. 
 I have tested it using iperf3, and even if I tinker with the settings to adjust threads it will not get any more than 100 Mbps. I have changed the mtu on both machines, changed the max tcp window size, and tried to change the hardware settings for nics on both of the machines. When I run a udp iperf3 test, I can reach the maximum speed my connection allows (1 Gbps).
 The reason why I believe more bandwidth should be possible is that when I use a wireguard vpn, I can reach tcp speeds through that connection to the server, above 600 mbps. Also, a speedtest from the server to a local speedtest server is about 1500 Mbps, and my connection to that same speedtest is at 1000 Mbps.
 I am not sure if this is just bad routing, or bandwidth delay product. Could someone shed some light on this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there even a big software company that provides even middling support these days?
 This weekend was a final migration from on-prem file server to Box. Users had been warned for weeks that this was coming, that the Box app had already been pushed to their computer, and that they needed to sign in to see how it worked so they would understand how everything worked and how to access shared files once the server is down.
 Of course most users ignored this and so, expecting exactly that, I was on site first thing today to get them going.
 Unfortunately things went sideways and most people who hadn't already signed in were unable to. The company uses Google Workspace so Box had been added as a SSO app through SAML, but signing in with their Google credentials either produced a prompt to create a password (???) or an error saying "invalid credentials".
 I immediately created a ticket with tons of detail and SAML traces, got a pretty quick reply from a T1 tech who said that the accounts I referenced didn't have passwords and could I please have the users create them. After a bit of back and forth about what "SSO" stands for he escalated the ticket.
 Hours passed. Frantic web searches yielded nothing. I looked through the SAML traces myself and couldn't find anything (I know nothing about web dev but figured I'd try). I called the Box account manager, who also "escalated". Updated the ticket email with more details. Called the account manager again. Had the customer's CFO call the account manager with me on the line.
 5 hours later I got a reply from someone claiming to be a T2 tech, asking for a SAML trace from an affected user.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I am experiencing some very odd TLS negotiation behavior between one of our clients and the webserver/LB (different sites).
 This is only affecting one LB for only one subnet in our VDI env (no other client has presented any problems).
 I can see traffic is leaving the VDI firewall and hitting the edge in front of the web server and then leaving, however, the FW outside our VDI env is not seeing any return traffic (I find this odd since Wireshark on the client shows reset packets as well as other ACK being sent from the webserver).
 Now here is where TLS comes in. I am seeing in a Wireshark capture multiple other connections going through the same edge FWs are negotiating at TLS v1.2 and are successful. But only this one is negotiating by default as TLS v1.0 by the client and then getting a reset (since we reject v1.0 and 1.1). I have tried forcing TLS v1.2 at the browser level on the client and it still negotiates at v1.0.
 The only thing I haven't tried (since I don't have admin access to the VDI machines) is doing the windows OS-level registry change for removing TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1
 Any suggestions?

 ​
 I left my previous role (Head of IT (was very hands-on/3rd line)) for an educational establishment in early 2021 as I needed a break and wanted to try something new (self empself-employedloyed retail business).
 ​
 It's been almost two years, and I'm ready to jump back into IT but struggling to land an interview.
 ​
 I do not want to go back into management. I always enjoyed the sysadmin and project side of the role, but I hated the management side. It wasn't my choice to get into management but something that happened over several years.
 ​
 Anyway, I've been applying for 2nd line/3rd line support roles as well as project-based infrastructure engineer roles. I haven't had one interview request with about 60 applications.
 ​
 I'm considering spending some downtime to re-train for a specific role since my previous roles were very general sysadmin and network support.
 ​
 I've considered either Cloud or Cyber Sec, but leaning more towards Cloud as I am more familiar with it. Likely Azure as I have had exposure to it. 
 ​
 My questions are:
  
If I pass a couple of Azure certs, am I likely to get a Azure-based role without practical experience working with Azure, considering I have 10 years of network/IT support experience?
 What over avenues can I go down to try to land a job back in IT?

 Trying to work on a budget here, so good Meraki gear is out of the question. A year or two ago or so, one of the UniFi "controller" upgrades put a bunch of our older, perfectly-functioning AP's out of management scope. They still run but we can't change any SSID settings or even see how many clients are connected because the hardware is EOL. I could understand a nag screen or something, but to actually take functionality away from perfectly functional hardware? Come on now.
 So we bite the bullet and pick up some new U6-LR AP's. Oh fantastic, now they are pulling 16+ watts each and overpowering the PoE switches, leading to constant reboots of the APs. Cool - it's one of the bugs that is fixed in the new UniFi "Network Application", let's upgrade that again.
 Nope! That requires installing Java 11, which seems to be either unobtainable or undetectable, because I've installed at least 3 different versions of JDK, OpenJDK, some weird third-party extraction of JRE 11, and some other garbage, just for the UniFi installer to tell me it still needs Java 11 and quit the installer. Why does the latest Unifi software not use the latest Java? We're on version 19 now for God's sake.
 So now I can't access old hardware, can't use new hardware, can't upgrade the software, and if I'm able to install it I'm sure I will run into some other new stupidity, plus have to hack my way into making it a service again because it's only a console application for some ridiculous reason.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company is a late adopter of the cloud, though they want to go to the cloud. For On Prem we use mainly Hyper-V for Windows and RHEV for Linux. I am on the Linux side and trying to create a gold image as we don't want to use the Market Place images, due to costs and mnagement. We have about a half dozen subscriptions for Azure and each one has many resource groups. 
 ​
 In tests it looks like the market place image is easy to deploy, though it isn't what we want. Looks like custom images are tied directly into the resource group and I think, if I undrestand it correctly, we need to have a gallery to be able to use an image within the other resource groups in the same subscription, though need a seperate gallery for each subscription? It feels like there are a lot of different settings when it comes to creating an image and Azure is very picky, yet very unforgiving about things. Simple things like changing names of the image can't be done, you have to create a new image w/ the name you want.
 ​
 Due to inforced RBAC, we can only create and delete VMs, we can't create Images, which is an internal problem that we have. So it doesn't help that we have a seperate team working on it, though we are trying to have that role added to our group. The other team, which is part of the Windows Team uses Market Place Image for their stuff, so they don't have much experience with creating gold images.
 ​
 Also the latency between the cloud and our on prem enviornment seems to introduce a lot of other issues, we have to up timeouts in tools that we have no issue communicating across the country to our sister DC, though communicating between our DC and Azure in the same side of the country has time out issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have recently taken a position as IT director and my predecessor was painfully parsimonious - to the extent that he was bragging about getting our main production switches - HP 1910's from an online seller of refurbished gear for $150 each. Now, one of our several firewalls (no, I don't know why there are several, but there are) has failed, and we have consumed the cold spare that was on the shelf, but the device is old enough to no longer be available for sale new. I'd like to unify our firewall duties into a single unit (or, preferably an HA pair), and wanted to see if anyone here has advise about any of the devices I'm considering. I have a personal bias toward the Palo's, since I spent the last two years piloting a pair of 5220s. Also, my network manager has an interest in Fortinet in particular, since they offer a full stack of gear - FW, switches, and APs. I also am not interested in Cisco, partly because the $250k order I placed at my former place of employment is on month 14 without fulfillment, with no end in sight. 
 Here's the list, and thanks for looking:
 FortiGate FG-101F
 WatchGuard Firebox M590
 PaloAlto PA-1410
 CheckPoint Quantum 6200
 Sophos XGS 2100

VLAN 1 - all ports are untagged. VLAN 10 - 1-26 are tagged while 27-28 are untagged. VLan 10 - 1-26 are tagged while 27-28 are untagged. Upstream router is acting as the DHCP server for each of these VLANs but each VLAN is configured on a different subnet on the upstream router. 
 ​
 My question is how does the upstream router know which subnet to serve DHCP on?

 10.0.10.0/24 - Working
 10.0.20.0/24 - Non working
 When request sent from pgadmin client to pgpool from non-working subnet, it takes about 15seconds for only one single packet to get processed. This happens at start of connection after three-way handshake.
 After that particular packet, subsequent packets are having <1ms RTT.
 From the same non-working setup, if we bypass pgpool, and directly access db, it works well.
 What could possibly causing this issue?
 It is consistently reproducible.
 Have asked this question in r/PostgreSQL but no conclusive help yet.

 A little background info before we start : I am originaly come from a software developper background. After some misshaps in my personal life, i've had difficulties finding a job as a developper. I then decided to apply for helpdesk positions at multiple local companies and landed myself a job at the local university.The job was advertised as a "helpdesk" position.
 I've been working there for the past 1.5 years. The transition with the person before me was a little rocky at first since i had so much to learn in so little time (AD / GPOs / Imaging / Networking ...) and i'm still learning new stuff everyday.
 I manage around 150-200 Windows 10 machines. The department uses a variety of CAD softwares ( CATIA / Inspire / MoldFlow / MSC Patran_Nastran / Vericut ...) but they mostly use SolidWorks.
 The person before used to create a windows image every year with the latest version of the softwares they use. This created a problem where the images he created were at the very least 75gb. I've been able to move away from this by automating most of the installs with scripts.
 Now that i think i have the basics down, i'd like to optimize the process and find ways to deal with SolidWorks configs in a multi-user environment.

On server side we are using switch independent teaming with dynamic load balancing with specific standby server. Whenever firewall changes from primary to secondary due to one link failure on one of server, primary firewall switches off all its connected ports to change connected servers teaming on standby mode. Now after sometimes primary firewall's all port switches on though secondary firewall is running. Now as server's active ports are on server teaming switches back to primary and firewall still in passive mode. Is there any way I can retain server NIC teaming to last state irrespective of primary port availability on server 2019.
 Thanks in Advance. Pardon for grammatical or any other mistake as I am new to this community.

 So we have a few locations where machines are randomly dying, (dell and hp), the users sometimes see an applocker style message saying an application cannot be run, please contact your system administrator, then if they reboot the machine goes into a state where it never fully boots, no real pattern at all, only oddity is they are all W10 pro boxes, and applocker is present in the domain, but those SKU's cannot run applocker (although it is logging that).
 This has only just started happening (1 end of last week, now we are seeing a lot more), anyone else seeing this?

 ​
 ​
 We have been doing some hardening work on server 2022. We had a company do a vulnerability assessment on our network and they found an issue on one of our servers.
 ​
 i have observed "SSL 64-bit Block Size Cipher Suites Supported (SWEET32)"
 ​
 ​
 I got this solution from vulnerability team , but don't know how to apply fix for the same.
 ​
 ​
 BTW, already disabled TLS 1.0 and 1.1

 We've noticed every Wednesday they are installed, we'll have a random user or 2 that then can't get on via DA the next day from home. A few reboots and appears to resolve itself.
 One machine I looked at I ran
 WMIC qfe list full (not sure how accurate this command is)
 On the Wednesday it showed KB5020487 installed on a machine and then the next day DA didn't work. A few reboots later it was back working.
 Searching for KB5020487 it doesn't exist on Microsoft's KB catalog. I've now looked at other machines that haven't had DA issues but also seeing KBs being installed on the Wednesday that have no Microsoft link in their "caption" entry and don't appear in the catalog. Another one on mine I've found from November KB5020372.
 n-able is the MPS software they use.
 UPDATE before finished typing :
 Looked at a machine that has Windows 11 that's not on the domain and it to has entries with a KB installed that has no reference in the catalog KB5017233. This odd entries are appearing in Windows 10 machines as well.
 Odd.

 In our environment we have end users which might be using any type of means to access an application (mobile, browser, citrix). Then this goes to a SaaS, then to k8s in GCP, then to an in-house developed App which is on-prem, and then to a good old backend (also on-prem). 
 Is it possible at all to keep the session ID as you pass all these steps, so that your modern session-based performance troubleshooting which you get in the microservices world, as you move to your legacy apps (in my case everything after the GCP).

 I've got a broken Server 2016 (HRESULT = 0x800f0805 - CBS_E_INVALID_PACKAGE on everything, no installed updates found, not able to add/remove roles and features, etc)
 This is a single domain-controller environment and I need to get this lifted over to a new install. (2019/2022)
 Migrating the DC itself is an OK process, but what is the most effective and least troublesome way of transferring folder redirection for 40 users to the new DC?
 I've done this once before by just robocopying eveything (with permissions and so forth) and all and change the path on the GPO, but two years later I still have calls regarding old paths.
 I've read that "copy content" is a dangerous option and I assume copying everything back to local requires everyone to re-log and will cause performance issues?
 Another thing I've read is to use DFS, however I have never touched DFS - is this the best way?
 I'd like to do it the correct way this time - what would be the best way? How is this done by the book with no future shit happening?
 EDIT: I've seen this Storage Migration Services as well, but that claims that DC's are not supported

I deleted all of the certificate files, I have tried to restart docker and the daemon. I have also tried to remove the override file that I tried to put the certificate in. To create the self-signed SSL certificate, I used the following script https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexisAhmed/DockerSecurityEssentials/main/Docker-TLS-Authentication/secure-docker-daemon.sh
 For the override.conf file within /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/override.conf I used the following configuration: [Service]ExecStart=ExecStart=/usr/bin/dockerd -D -H unix:///var/run/docker.sock --tlsverify --tlscert=/home//.docker/server-cert.pem --tlscacert=/home//.docker/ca.pem --tlskey=/home//.docker/server-key.pem -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2376
 I have restarted the docker container but that has also failed to work.
 Furthermore, I have also deleted the ssl certificate so I have no idea where it is pulling the old on from.

 In my quest to find a good but still affordable ZTNA and a WAF solution i stumbled upon Cloudflare. It instantly became my favorite IT company in existence.
 Their core belief is "security is something that should be accessible to everyone" and they really actually mean it. If you don't know them, let me introduce you to some of their services
  
The fastest DNS resolver in the world with high regards on privacy (free)
 DNS for families that protect against malware and/or adult content (free)
 An extremely affordable ZTNA solution (free for <50 users)
 A WAF, SSL/TLS and DDoS Protection (free for standard usecases)
  
Thank you cloudflare, for making security available to everyone, especially for private usage and small companies too.
 I highly recommend cloudflare, and I am absolutely stunned by their portfolio, their generosity and what they do. Great stuff!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are located in a small office, with lots of computers on the same subnet. The layout is pretty simple. We have an old windows 2012 server that acts as a DHCP server. A few switches and access points for wifi devices. On the edge of the network there is a Cisco firepower 1120 outside connected to the ISP and inside is connected to the main switch. We use this for RA VPN and we can reach the internet through this. We have no router, only switches and acces points.
 The problem is when the firewall is down the subnet becomes unresponsive, devices cannot ping eachother, sometimes new devices do net get IP addresses. If the firewall is removed computers should be able to arp and find other devices, and we should still get IP addresses since we have a DHCP server. In the firewall DHCP server is disabled. 
 We had an old ASA firewall and the issue was the same with that one, but I would like to get to the bottom of this problem. The firewall config is almost default, one acl to allow internet access, dhcp disabled, RA VPN enabled. NAT is the default dynamic inside,outside.
 ​
 Does anyone have an idea what could be the problem? Does this has anything to do with proxy arp?

Occasionally I need to configure a device and have it sent to them, and because they use it all day, they need it to arrive already configured, logged in, applications set up etc etc.
 ​
 We're using InTune with AzureAD authentication, a mixture of Windows laptops/tablets and Android phones. We're encrypting the devices before sending them out etc.
 ​
 The main issue I'm having is that before I can configure a device, I need to contact the user and ask for their password. Sometimes the user is unavailable, and I can't get hold of them, which delays things, and I also worry that taking a note of their password is a bad practice.
 ​
 I wonder if there is a way that I can configure the devices and sign into the user's corporate accounts on the devices without needing their password. If not, then what is the best practice to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi fellow sys admins,
 I'm trying to deal with a very interesting (to me) case. Someone is proxy-mirroring all content of my website under a different domain name.
  
Original: https://www.saashub.com
 Abuser/Proxy-mirror: https://sukuns.us.to
  
My ideas of resolution:
  
Block them by IP - That doesn't work as they are rotating the IP from which the request is coming.
 Block them by User Agent - They are duplicating the user-agent of the person making the request to sukuns.us.to
 Add some JavaScript to redirect to the original domain-name - They are stripping all JS.
 Use absolute URLs everywhere - they are rewriting everything www.saashub.com to their domain name.
  
i.e. I'm out of ideas. Any suggestions would be highly appreciated.
 p.s. what is more, Bing is indexing all of SaaSHub's content under sukuns.us.to ¯\_(ツ)_/¯. I've reported a copyright infringement, but I have a feeling that it could take ages to get resolved.

 Some prerequisite info:
 CRC is a very commonly used way to detect errors in computer networks.
 P(x), G(x), R(x), and T(x) are all polynomials under binary field arithmetic (i.e., all coefficients are mod2: 0 or 1).
 P(x) is the polynomial that we are given and that we will divide by.
 E(x) is an error pattern. It is XORed with T(x) to get T'(x). G(x) is the message that we want to send.
 R(x) is the remainder of G(x)/P(x) or just G(x)modP(x).
 T(x) is our sent data, (x^k)G(x)+R(x), where k is the degree of P(x).
 T'(x) is our received data but potentially with errors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I run a vpn server with the interface tun0 on a server. I want to open the SSH port on this server so that the ssh connection is allowed only after VPN authentication.
 Which of the following firewall rules is correct:
  
specifying the tunnel:
 ufw allow in on tun0 from any to any port 22 
 
specifying the VPN IP address:
 ufw allow from 10.8.0.2 to any port 22 
 
 Let’s say the server is at 10.8.0.1, and there is only one client at 10.8.0.2. 
 For the second rule, the interface tun0 is not specified. The IP address 10.8.0.2 is not unique. What if the packet comes from an external private IP 10.8.0.2 to the default interface eth0, not from the 10.8.0.2 in the tunnel ? It seems to me the interface must be specified not the IP, to restrict SSH to VPN.
 For the first rule, I suppose the request from 10.8.0.2 first goes to the VPN gateway, say, 10.8.0.0, and then to 10.8.0.1. So shouldn’t it be “from 10.8.0.0”?
 Another question: For the “to any,” if I specify “to 10.8.0.1,” would that prevent NAT masquerading, thus login rejection?

 To put my mind at ease I’ve been thinking about encrypting the traffic, but it’s not something I’ve done before. The switches are both Cisco 9200L. Is it relatively easy to accomplish and is there any added latency?

 Calling all HP 3Par all stars - am I barking up the wrong tree here? Can I do this, will it work?
 We've recently decommissioned/replaced three x HP 3Par SAN's. 1 x 7200 and 2 x 8200's. All are still functional, just out of maintenance.
 I'm contemplating building a Frankenmonster play unit and/or get out of jail free card should bad things happen.
 My thoughts were to take one of the 8200's (being newer) and harvest the others for all the good stuff - SSD's, RAM, an external disk shelf from the 7200 etc and build something as big and as good as possible given the bits I've got.
 Can I do this with the 3Par platform? I do it all the time with old servers, what about storage?
 Oh - and this will all be 100% offline too - I've kept the old FC switches and a couple of old ESX hosts to build an unsupported play area.
 Any thoughts/comments/traps greatly appreciated.
 Cheers,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 We were asked to block all RDPs on our network, and while I have most successfully blocked wither via the firwall or GPO, Splashtop seems to be a massive issue for us. We cannot block it through the firewall, and we are talking to the vendors as they are just as confused as we are. HOWEVER, I decided to block splashtop via GPO and it it still gains access to the internal PCs. 
 I have it blocked for users and computers using both the 'don't run specified application' and software restriction policies and the app still gets through. Any idea what the hell is going on? I have never seen this crap before.

 For example, if it the packet starts with a TTL=100 and it appears that there is 19 hops in the trace route but two of them are “request timed out”, the TTL will be equal to 19, 17, 18 or 16 (depends if the last row decrease the TTL or no?)

Consider this an environment where the likes of Fortinet, Sonicwall or Palo Alto is cost prohibitive. Have come across vendors that are offering generic devices that can they claim to do the same functions without a lot name recognition. One issue I have run into is the ability assess these devices as they aren't put through a lot of certification processes or community voices around them.
 Has anyone been down this path before? what did you look for in a successful implementation. How did your solution scale.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to replace existing Juniper gear with HPE 5900AF switches. As I don't have that much experience with HPE/Comware, I need some help.
 What the setup should look like:
 ​
 2x 10GbE Ports coming from the upstream provider, running BGP on their end. That means: BGP to the upstream provider, announcing multiple IPv4 and v6 subnets but only taking a default route.
 Customers will also terminate on the switch with a seperate vlan for each customer (And on a seperate port for each customer.) Inside of that VLAN, there will be one gateway address .1. 
 Is there something like l3Interface in Comware like it exists on JunOS or how do I connect the customer vlans to the upstream provider with the default route? Or do I need a bridge like interface for this?
 Also, are the switches capable of line rate L3 features like ACLs? Or will they suffer and choke with a few ACLs/sFlow on some ports?
 Any help is appreciated.

I'm also 42 with only one kid left at home but she has one foot out the door so it'll just be my wife and the cat with little expenses so I'm OK with the pay cut if it's low stress and good bennies. I keep looking at the IT landscape and feel like it's going to change very fast over the next few years with consolidation (cloud/saas) and competition for jobs is increasing. I don't want to deal with that now.
 I see quite a few government job openings around the 100k range (plus wife's salary) and keep thinking that's good enough for me to coast until retirement and I know a few folks who work there saying it's gravy work. Plus there's that 20-and-out retirement I keep reading about. But I don't want to be doing absolutely anything though cause that would just suck.
 So anyway, folks who work in the government how do you like it?

 For our organization we need to deploying different PAC files to users depending on their association.
 For historical reasons this is supposed to be done in the form
 http://<IP>:8001 -> hand out PAC script1
 http://<IP>:8002 -> hand out PAC script2, etc
 Now I just want to make sure my solution is viable.
 My idea is to just take a good old Apache, have it listen on all the required ports and set the DirectoryIndex to the matching PAC file.
 Would that work?

 - Mouse emulation method, I've always defaulted to "drag to move" yet, with this setting enabled, I can no longer pinch to zoom which is another hurdle to overcome.

I’ve pulled plenty of single pair fiber and done some SC tipping manually, but nothing on this scale. We’re moving to all LC connections and I’m planning on using a fiber splicer during the install.
 I’m curious to hear what some common pitfalls are and how I can avoid them, and any other tips or tricks anyone has for a project of this scope.

 I'm a developer and sysadmin. Lots of VMware, Ansible, Docker, OpenVPN. Have a tiny bit of experience with AWS, CI/CD (Github Actions), Networking & Security knowledge. I love Linux, tolerate Windows. Most of my programming experience has been with Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, and Python but I'm learning Golang. 
 Disadvantages: No certs, but I'm considering studying for one of the AWS certs. I have a half finished CS degree, couldn't complete for financial reasons. 
 My current role is independent contractor for a couple small Canadian businesses. I'm definitely undercharging them ($25/hour CAD) but that's a damn good rate here in South America. 
 How much should I be charging new clients?

 The best I've come up with so far is to make an aliased script or program (in some non-powershell language) somewhere in %PATH%, which starts powershell with -bypass, and have "set-executionpolicy Restricted -scope process" as the last line in the profile script - clunky, but at least the spirit of the execution policy would be preserved.

 So we just had multiple clients bite the dust when it comes to e-mail because of the whole Rackspace Ransomware attack. I was just wondering if anybody had any tips for getting some of my clients' Office 365 software clients synced and running correctly. So far my process has been this:
 - Remote in through Teamviewer
 - Open Outlook
 - Backup .PST files (some of these folks have multiple mailboxes, so I make separate backups for each, which is a total pain and very tedious and time consuming)
 - Delete Profile from Control Panel > Mail Credentials
 - Run Outlook & Put In Email Address & P/W
 - Import .PST Files
 There has to be a better way. Like, I thought I should just be able to tell the email software that Hey! This is now Office 365! And then it just automatically swaps over or something. Is this really the only way to do this? Thank you for any help/tips. It is greatly appreciated as it looks like I'm starring down the barrel of a full week of 10 hour+ days if this is how it has to be. Thank you

 It would seem very inefficient, because the same data would be transferred many times over some internet backbones, to go to all the viewers in some area.

 How do you guys describe your role as a network engineer to non-technical folks?
 I've gotten into the habit of just saying I work in "IT" to describe what I do for a living to everyone. But this past week, I was recently hired on as a Sr. Network Engineer for this new company and attended a group onboard meeting. It was just me, a new exec, and the HR person.
 We were asked to describe our roles, and I said "IT" work. Without missing a beat, the exec took out his phone, immediately handed it to me, and asked me to tshoot why it was so slow.
 I half-jokingly said that they'll need a ticket before I can do any type of work and expanded that I will be leading the team on the transition, design, and implementation of new acquisition networks, implementing security policies, and datacenter/cloud work. Connectivity. HR lady jumps in and says I fix the WiFi and VPN.
 Later that day, I was out celebrating with friends and met someone new who asked me what I do for a living. I jokingly responded network engineer, I fix WiFi and VPN. My partner got upset and asked why I degrade myself...
 Interested in hearing what you guys say when this question pops up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have several old HDDs that have had company information on them. I plan on throwing the disks away as they are old.
 I have quick formatted them in Windows but I found that I can use Mac Disk Utility secure erase with several passes on the drives.
 I was wondering if there is any need to use a tool like DBAN to wipe them, or is secure erase good enough on the Mac? I have an external HDD reader so that lets me wipe the drives on any of my Mac or Windows systems. Or maybe just a hammer and drill could be used and no software wipe at all, thought on this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The only IT employee quit a day after I was hired, just long enough to provide credentials to everything. I've been taking inventory, and the products we have issued out + new in box (about three dozen units) isn't matching up with how many were purchased on their respective websites.
 1) The highest tier warranty was purchased. 2) Computrace was not purchased or used on any device. 3) All devices have vPro. 4) We don't use a volume license; everything is OEM image that's been removed of some preinstalled programs, then GPO when joined to the domain. 5) How would I check to see if any Out Of Band management was used?
 I'm not looking to get anyone in trouble. Just want to cover my ass. Even something like a "last powered on" date would be helpful. It's also possible that these are still in service somewhere, maybe even off the domain and/or without network connectivity. 
 Thanks for any help.
 EDIT: I have used almost every method mentioned here thus far, to no avail. I'm specifically looking for tools that Lenovo or Dell may have. To be bluntly clear, I am trying to locate about 9 devices that were purchased, with an order and serial number associated to the devices, but are nowhere to be found. Only 2 of 9 of these devices were once domain-joined computers. So, I'm suspecting 7 of these devices have possibly been stolen, and I need some way to cover my ass. It's a smallish company and HR hates me as it is.

Works really cool for IoT type devices that can join WPA3 or 802.1x networks. 
 However, I want to add another feature that I think would be cool. Which is detecting the network layer ones using SNMP messages. So I wanted to know if anyone had a cool place to get a bunch of dumps of SNMP traffic or the raw models that the vendors use.

 To measure latency and jitter for all ports, repeat this procedure for each pair of DUT's port.
 Do you think this test is OK for a telecom customer to see?

 I need to create a lab environment for each user.
 Users will be able to open a specially created linux machine with novnc and manage it through the browser. By running vulnerable machines in a lab environment, isolated machines and networks must be created for each user.
 If the user wants to scan the vulnerable target machines isolated for him using his own physical computer, he will be able to access it with VPN.
 If he does not want to use VPN and physical computer, he will be able to reach target machines with novnc.
 All they need to do is press a button.
 I tried using proxmox, openvpn, pfsense for this, I tried to create vlans for each user, but I thought it would be inefficient and difficult.
 I am currently researching cloud management software in the style of cloudstack, how do you think I can do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Had a fun 48 hours. Noticed one of my scheduled backups failed and took a look at our NAS (backups for offline storage) and one of the drives was down on our raid 6. Also noticed a fan was down in the logs in the idrac. 
 Okay, put in a service ticket as it's under warranty. Go home and think nothing of it. 
 2nd shift tech shoots me a message in the middle of the night that he noticed something revving up in our DC but couldn't pinpoint it - then goes home. While everyone is sleeping the idrac shuts the NAS down on it's own overnight. I come in next day, can't remote into it so I find out it is offline, then plug in a crash cart. All the volumes showing as foreign and the config is gone.
 OK - little worried. Check the idrac and see all the volumes disconnected from the raid controller. Bump up the escalation on the service ticket and engineer comes out within a few hours. 
 We replace 1x drive, 2x fans. Bright orange dell fans were now black and a little melty. Forced to acknowledge all the volumes as foreign and reload the config. Thankfully everything boots as it should and that knot in my stomach releases a bit.
 Apparently if you lose 2 of 5 fans, the unit shuts itself down to protect from heat damage. The more you knowwww!
 Not sure why the config was wiped other than perhaps the shutdown was not the most graceful.

I found my solution and it was from surprise surprise Microsoft. LGPO is a command line program that lets you dump the current LOCAL not domain GPO to a text file then convert it back to a policy and import it. Working with it via powershell is a bit clunky, you need to do use Start-Process with CMD as admin to do anything but it works! Just thought I’d give an update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 This maybe a little off topic, so feel free to say i should post it elsewhere.
 I am trying to help out a charity with their mess of a computer system, they currently access their emails via Gmail Workspace and some of these mailbox’s are large at over 15GB.
 They have got Microsoft Business 365 Premium for free as they are a nonprofit and they want to move everything over to Microsoft.
 This is not something I have done before and I'm hoping will be something useful for me to learn more about.
 So I believe from the Microsoft Admin Centre I can migrate the emails across from Gmail into Microsoft and then the DNS servers will just need to be changed from the current Gmail ones to the Microsoft DNS servers? 
 Then set up the desktop Outlook app to connect to the new Exchange server 
 I found this guide for the migration here - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mailbox-migration/migrating-imap-mailboxes/migrate-g-suite-mailboxes but I am a little concerned about relying on Google and MS to talk to each other properly and do the import correctly. My original idea was to just drag all the emails from their Google Workspace into a local pst file on Outlook desktop app then after changing over to M365 to copy them back across. More labour intensive but safer?
 Also if I do the migration for a 15GB mailbox I expect that to take several hours and theres a good chance emails will be received during that time so what happens to them?
 Have I missed anything out?
 One thing that does concern me is that at the top of that page it says "Effective from December 2022, the classic Exchange Admin Center will be deprecated for worldwide customers. Microsoft recommends using the new Exchange Admin Center, if not already doing so. "
 The further down in step 5 it says "IMAP migration is not available for new EAC. " 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I'm working on some FileShare permissions as a cleanup project; by default, our permissions are applied to a top-level file share folder. Different permissions may be applied to a subfolder no more than one level below the top-level file share. 
 We are actively trying to enforce that any other folder permissions needed which don’t fit this model should use a separate subfolder under the top-level file share folder (i.e., \Server1\Accounting\CustomFolder ). 
 I'm trying to tackle this with PowerShell and the NTFSSecurity module if we have a "Read Only Group" and a "Read Write AD group" applied in the ACLs. I want to get the AD RO or RW group members and see if they are in any folders deep than that to clean it up. 
 Example: Share1/Dept/Folder1/Folder2/Folder3 If Joe Doe is already in an AD group at the Dept folder and then some admin added him directly to Folder3, I'll like to have a report showing that.
 I've been doing PS for around six months now, I can do one-liners pretty well, but I need help to write scripts. I would appreciate any guidance you can give me, and if I asked a stupid question or worded it poorly, please let me know! Some of the scripts I've been using are: 
 $notInherited = Get-ChildItem -Path "\\Server1\DeptFolder" -Directory -Recurse | Get-NTFSAccess | Where-Object {!($_.IsInherited)} $notInherited | Export-Excel C:\Temp\Spreadsheets\Data_NotInherited.xlsx -TableName Permissions -AutoSize

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm looking to learn more about colocation and networking in the data center environment. Essentially, I have a few servers that I want to put into a rack in a data center but I'm tossed up on what direction I should start with.
 The first topic is the choice of networking equipment. The data center provides a 1 Gbps SFP connection. Now, I could plug that directly into a switch and have a server in the rack that handles DHCP, but are there any good cheap switches that have a DHCP server built in that also allows for easy remote management? 
 The first setup I was looking at using was a Ubiquiti Dream Machine SE and a Ubiquti Pro switch. I would plug the SFP from the data center into the Dream Machine, then another SFP from the Dream Machine into the Pro Switch. Ubiquiti was a choice due to the familiarity of knowing how to manage the settings on both devices.
 The second setup was looking into Cisco Meraki devices, however, I'm not familiar with Cisco's product lineup. I do have my CompTIA A+ and Network+, so I am somewhat familiar with using the CLI, but the program I was in only had us focus on managing Cisco devices on a LAN through the CLI only. I was scrolling through threads on WHT and several times Cisco Meraki devices came up. Does anyone know if Cisco Meraki devices have a built in DHCP server? If not, then I would still need to have a DHCP server setup in the rack.
 Also, does anyone have any recommendations on material that I can use to help better understand networking concepts and practices in the data center regarding how to setup and manage BGP, how to assign IPv4 subnets to specific devices, or personal advice with first time colocation experiences?
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Question for you all out there. I've seen many companies do their hostname and domain name formatting in different ways. In the context of an ISP, there are several ways one can identify various useful elements within an FQDN. For example, I've seen companies name router hostnames like:
 ar1.site1.area1
 And:
 ar1-site1-area1
 And various forms with various identifying language within them. 
 I've seen domain portions of the FQDN done several ways too, like:
 {{hostname}}.{{network_type}}.{{state/province}}.example.com
 {{hostname}}.{{airportcode}}.{{countrycode}}.example.com
 Etc.
 My question here is: in the context of a (W)ISP with various services (internet, TV, phone), what do you guys suggest regarding naming standards when it comes to hyphens and dots, particularly in the hostname portion? Do you prefer over over the other? Why?
 What's a naming scheme that really stuck out to you in your environment(s) as being very useful and easily let's you identify devices just by their names? 
 Thanks in advance. :)

 During the cutover, one of the corporate IT network guys said there were a bunch of CRC errors on one piece of network equipment or another, and that this was causing really bad slowness. We were then instructed to replace any fiber cables shorter than 2 meters with longer ones. We had a number of 1M cables in place. Apparently (I didn't see for myself) the errors went away after this was done. I understand that the IEEE standard says 2M minimum for SR fiber, but I thought that was mainly due to Tx levels potentially being higher than the Rx threshold and damaging the equipment.
 How does it cause CRC errors as well?

Are there any good parts of the job? I’m wondering because I am on the path of cyber security and was trying to figure out if I wanted to go system administrator or network administrator . I personally prefer software and systems over networks, but not if it’s as bad as everyone says.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys I just got a new job and they wanted me to purchase a Windows server 2019 machine to be used as a file server running alongside of their current server which is a Windows server 2003 machine which is controlling their DNS and domain/domain controller and a few shared drives. I was able to install and set up the machine and share the drives that they wanted to be shared but I'm unable to allow users to enter their credentials to connect. Currently the only way it works for me is if it's passwordless, otherwise anytime anyone tries to connect it says that they're not authorized to do so. I figured I could solve this by adding the server 2019 machine to their domain but so far I haven't had any luck. I keep getting an error saying it found the DNS but can't connect. Can anyone help me out please? I'll edit this with the exact errors soon I'm heading in to the office now

 I remember seeing some posts on here a while back about using script servers for running powershell scripts, but I'm struggling to find it. 
 Does anyone know where the link is and/or have good suggestions for server software (for running powershell scripts)? We typically use scheduled tasks, but I think pitching the idea of a script server would be good.
 Many thanks!

 So I am trying to get a better gauge on what I should actually expect from my NOC? Should I expect them to fully own and run all maintenance and break fix with no help? When is an escalation a good escalation?

 Problem: 
 We have an enterprise network with 50+ sites. These sites all have SDWAN routers/Cisco switches utilizing VLANS. Most of these sites have UPS’ connected via Ethernet for monitoring purposes. I need to know which interfaces these UPS’ are connected to so we can remotely check the interfaces when issues arise with the UPS monitoring system. 
 The only information I have about these UPS’ are their IPs and what site they are at. I could possibly get the macs of all the NICs but this would take a lot more time then I would like to spend on this project. 
 Question:
 What is the fastest way to go from “I know this IP is located at this site” to “I know the interface this IP is connected directly to.”
 Thanks for your help 🙏🏻

 For some time now we have been experiencing an issue on the network for a while. I haven't been able to figure it out.
 When downloading a large file (usually 500 mb or higher) the download starts strong, then slows down, coming to a complete stop eventually. I've tested this at the router by plugging a laptop directly into our router. The download is fine there. But from the router, it goes downstream to our ASA then to our Core Switch. I tried the download directly out of the Core Switch as well and it seems like the problem starts when I am in the internal part of the network (ASA and downstream). I have been looking into QoS as other engineers have suggested. I am the only Network Engineer and I've been stuck on this problem for a while now. Can anyone please provide some insight to what may be happening on our network?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings!
 Have an issue with merging two Authorization Profile on one AuthZ Policy. I'm using a custom vendor radius attribute. It's 12356 for Fortigate, id 1, named Fortinet-Group-Name. I have created the custom RADIUS Vendor attribute with the " Allow multiple instances of this attribute in a profile " checkbox checked.
 Case 1) If I put multiple instances in 1 Authorization Profile and apply it to a Policy, it works.
 Case 2) If I put more than one Authorization Profile on one AuthZ policy, it does not send more than 1 instance of the attribute. I've tested with 2 profiles where they have one attribute instance each.
 So, the RADUIS attribute seems to allow multiple instances, but the rule will not correctly merge the two AuthZ Profiles that is put on the AuthZ policy.
 The auth report in case1 correctly shows that attributed repeated 2 times as it's supposed to, with two different group names. In case 2 however, the authZ result still matches the two AuthZ Profiles, but in the "results" part in the bottom only 1 radius attribute is shown.
 I'm on ISE 2.7p7. I know there is a new patch, but can't update until next window, and cannot find any resolved caveats in p8 docs to hint that a update would work anyway. Also, I've verified the two cases with pcap.
 Any help appriciated.

 It's a square room.
 Left wall = entire whiteboard
 Front wall = TV screen, windows PC, standard webcam
 Right Wall = nothing
 Back wall = glass and door to leave
 The webcam on the TV can't be turned to see the white board because of the sharp angle. It seems the only solution is to get a camera on the right wall (something with double sided tape or some way to stay near the ceiling and out of sight.
 I tried putting a small tripod with an OSBOT on the center table, but they weren't happy with how it looked.
 https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B08NPGNMV8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1
 Any suggestions of a camera I could somehow attach to the wall on the right side? The room is probably 15 feet x 15 feet. The cables will be tricky to pass all the way up there, but something that can have a good angle, possibly a zoom if the whiteboard isn't visible enough.
 We use the free version of discord and other meeting software, they only show 720p so I don't need a fancy 4k solution.
 Thanks for any advice if you guys have gone through this setup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am planning my third decade into the networking, I thought I should get some feedback from the community. I spent my first decade working for Cisco and Juniper in Bay Area (California). I was mainly involved in network protocol testing and verification, simulating large customer environments, doing proof of concepts, educating sales engineers, handling escalated customer issues etc. Along with tremendous learning, jobs were financially rewarding as well. However towards the end I started feeling that I am not spending enough time with family. This led me into my second decade of networking job, I joined a mid size organization as a senior network engineer. I have been working for this employer for over 11 years now. The job is very stable and work life balance is great. As you can imagine after working in a same job for such a long time, it can become boring. Although I am at senior level, I still need to do maintenance windows and hardware refreshes which I don't enjoy any more. I am ready to pivot into my third decade of networking and looking for a job change. I intend to work 5-10 years before retiring. During my years at Cisco and Juniper, I worked closely with both Product Managers and Technical Marketing engineers. I think I am going to target one of this role for my future job. What you guys think? My in-depth understanding of networking products along with network automation experience could make a good candidate for TME role. Also my current work experience (running and operating a decent size network) could be a valuable asset to a Product Manager role. I would appreciate if people who have worked as TME or Product Manager can share their experiences. What are pros and cons of each role? From the compensation perspective, are these roles similar? Which one would be a better career path considering I have about 5-10 year left. I appreciate all the responses.

 We have Proofpoint as our primary spam filter with Exchange online. Lately, more and more phishing and spam emails have been getting through Proofpoint and every time we get a "Phish delivered due to an ETR override" alert from Microsoft. This seems to be an alert policy only.
 I was wondering if anyone knew of a way to not only alert us with this ETR email, but automatically move any mail that hits that notification policy to the users Junk box? Right now, it notifies us and sends it to the users inbox.
 Thank you!

 I need to create a lab environment for each user.
 Users will be able to open a specially created linux machine with novnc and manage it through the browser. By running vulnerable machines in a lab environment, isolated machines and networks must be created for each user.
 If the user wants to scan the vulnerable target machines isolated for him using his own physical computer, he will be able to access it with VPN.
 If he does not want to use VPN and physical computer, he will be able to reach target machines with novnc.
 All they need to do is press a button.
 I tried using proxmox, openvpn, pfsense for this, I tried to create vlans for each user, but I thought it would be inefficient and difficult.
 I am currently researching cloud management software in the style of cloudstack, how do you think I can do this?

 Long story short, spent my 20s trying to impress others rather than pursue my own interests/happiness. Obtained a BSc and PhD in biological sciences but have no intention of pursuing a career in that field.
 Recently enrolled in a 2-year college networking program. Will likely be on a wait list for another year before I can start. Looking to start teaching myself now but would like some direction.
 In your opinion, what are the most important skills for future network engineers? For example, are there particular programming languages that I should become familiar with? What Linux-based environments should I familiarize myself with?
 I am currently starting with the basics. Started a few self-directed networking crash courses on Udemy. Any help is appreciated.

 I could use autoscaling in AWS with user data or lambda but it's too expensive.
 I had a search but found it very difficult to get much other than farming simulator for 'Server farm hire'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This post is directly copied from r/ITManagers (albeit with some added bits). I was advised to post this on this subreddit
 So our DHCP pool is full pretty often. A lot of users are using laptops. When they connect their laptop to a cable, their WiFi is still connected. Because of this, a lot of users are using two IP addresses while only one is needed.
 I found some solutions. A Powershell script and a GPO policy that makes it so that an established LAN connection will disable the WiFi connection. However, I don't think this cancels the IP Lease that the WiFi connection has. Is there a way to make the WiFi disable AND the leased WiFi IP to be released again?
 The GPO solution would be the best, as we wouldn't have to do this on every pc individually. I found the following policy: Computer Configuration -> Policies ->Administrative Templates -> Network ->Windows Connection Manager > Minimize the number of simultaneous connections to the Internet or a Windows". I am not sure if this also releases the IP-lease of the WiFi connection from the DHCP pool. If not, this wouldn't work as a solution as well.
 I like to add that I am just a helpdesk support Employee. I am guessing a lot of people will say that we shouldn't have LAN and DHCP in the same IP Range. Though you are probably right, I am Sadly not in a position to change this.
 Thanks in advance.

 On an Intel NUC used as a terminal to use RDS a user has a lot of déconnections.
 I ping - t and noticed that TTL alternates between 60 for a while then 251 for a while, again and again. When TTL is 251 connection is lost but ping still responds.
 I made a tracert, worked in 5 hops. I ping -t the five hops (the fifth is the destination) and the first is at TTL 255, the second 254, etc. So the destination is 251 and it makes sense but it always alternates between 251 and 60. In both case, the hop before maintains TTL 252.
 How do I intepretate that? (I'm a young tech sry if the answer is easy)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi to everyone,
 Next year I will quit my work as system and network administrator and I plan to travel the world for a year. 
 Does someone know where to find "remote/freelance" job offers or has already experience with this situation. 
 I am still undecided how and whether I want to work at all. On one side I would be happy to have an income to cover my expenses a little. On the other side I dont know if it would limit me too much in my plans.
 I cannot be sure to be always available (internet connection in rural areas all over the world?) and the time differences would also cause problem. Of course, I also want to do and see as much as possible during my trip. To work would also mean a daily loss of time. 
 It is not about the money. I don't necessarily have to work to be able to afford the trip. However, it would be helpful.
 I could imagine working a few hours a day as 1st Level remote support. But I'm not even sure if I should. 
 Do you think it makes sense to look for a job in IT at all, or are other fields of work better suited. For example, as a sales agent. However, I have no experience in this or other sectors. 
 Background:
 Working in IT for more then 10 years. More or less fluent in 3 languages. 
 3 years first and second level support with basic tasks. (mostly onsite computer repairs, helping on user requests with office etc, some network and server administration)
 Afterwards in a small industrial company where my colleagues and I have been responsable for "everything computer related". From Backup, Network, Mailing, Virtualization, Software, Hardware, Printers, Mobile Devices, Security and so on. 
 I would say I have deep knowledge of most areas a normal company uses, so I would not need to much training in something "easy". 
 ​
 But as I already said I am unsure if this would even fit me. 
 Let me hear what you guys think about my thoughts.

Are the two not just different methods by which new users can be created? Admittedly, Dashboard gives you different options through the process, but is it definitively the right way and AD should never be utilised? My 'educator' tells me Dashboard is Microsoft's preferred method and should therefore only ever be used, but I disagree using AD is "wrong", per se.

 We've been targeted by some weirdo for the past 4 days, sending emails to some of our users rambling about nonsense. Problem is he creates new gmail or yahoo addresses every single day to send new stuff. There's nothing really dangerous, no malware or anything else.
 He uses his real name + a series of random numbers + yahoo.com or google.com domain
 At first I blacklisted his first address, and the next day when the second email arrived I made a new mail flow rule to block his name (only part of the addres which has not changed
 The rule is enabled, Enforced, applies if the sender's address contains "hisname" and deletes the mail without notifying anyone. 
 I already had a rule like this for specific commercial addresses which managed to bypass our spam filtering and as far as I can tell those work just fine. 
 Other rules set to look for specific strings seem to work too, stuff like subject contains "BTC wallet" and so on, but not this one for some reason. Any ideas ?

 First, I deeply apologize for the title.
 Backstory: A customer of ours have a problem with their Cisco FPR 4210 (two firewalls in HA pair). When they tried to upgrade the FTD to a newer version, the secondary firewall failed and complained about that the RAM is malfunctioned. The customer contacted us and our helpdesk opened a TAC case and TAC did a RMA and send the customer a brand new chassi.. 
 To my question: Since the firewalls are active/standy, the customer mentioned that a part of the secondary firewall is active. So some interfaces and routing on the secondary firewall (the standby) is active. 
 Now Im trying to understand how this can be possible done. I do not see the logic by using an active/standby but at the same time using a part of the configuration in the stan…]]></summary>

 A third party is going to upgrade a software and they have asked me to upgrade two instances from SQL Server 2012 -> 2019.
 I am not very experienced with MS SQL.
 From what I have seen there are two options:
  
Use the in-house upgrade in the setup.exe for SQL 2019
 Disable the SQL-service, management studio -> backup, install the new instances on 2019 and restore the backups
  
I do however have a couple of questions:
 Is even 1. worth trying? It's very small databases.
 I assume I cannot recreate them with the same names, I have to delete the 2012 before creating the 2019's which leaves me without anything to fall back to?
 Is there anything else I have to keep in mind?
 What is the go-to way to do this as painless and efficient as possible?

 I honest rarely post online, but I would love to hear your thoughts about this as I'm honestly a bit confused and don't know what to do.
 I'm currently transitioning to a new company (corporate), the company has been around for nearly 20 years now. The salary is good, and you know the usual 9-5 job, I decided to give my notice to my current employer to join this company.
 Mid my notice period, a startup company that is funded and supported has offered me a position, the salary is the same as the one I received from company I'm moving into, although the base salary itself is higher by around $500/month, since they don't have the same benefits as that company, they decided to pump my base salary in order to match the offer that I received from the big company.
 Overall, both companies offered me the same salary, although the big company got more now such as bonuses, among other benefits.
 The startup does not have any benefits beside the monthly salary as they are pretty new right now, I asked them about bonuses, and they said its planned but not yet confirmed as they've just started. They also do not provide equity, and they could not provide me with an answer if they plan on giving equity or not.
 I'm honestly pretty confused right now on what to pick, I was gonna pick the startup as I bet it would be more relaxed (in terms of environment not work), but if i'm taking a high risk, what's the high reward exactly if there is no equity provided ?
 Sorry for my bad English, please let me know your thoughts about this :(

In Microsoft Edge version 110, the certificate trust list and the certificate verifier will be decoupled from the host operating system’s root store. Instead, the default certificate trust list and the certificate verifier will be provided by and shipped with the browser.
  
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/deployedge/microsoft-edge-security-cert-verification
 There is a policy to still use the system store, but it is removed within the version 111.
 I don't like it, but I might be wrong. Just wanted to let you know - in case you didn't hear it.
 ​
 Edit: Maybe I misunderstood the information. It is also written:
  
In addition to trusting the built-in roots that ship with Microsoft Edge, the browser will also query the underlying platform for—and trust—locally installed roots that users and/or enterprises installed.
  
I missed that out. Sorry for the inconveniences.

 Primary DNS server kicked the bucket a couple of months back (that was a fun day). I then changed the DHCP server to point clients to use the secondary DNS server as the primary, and use the Sophos UTM as the secondary DNS server. 
 Jump to last week... Sophos UTM gets pulled and replaced with a Fortigate 80F (I am in love). 
 Jump to this week... I am slowly adding Security Profiles to the Fortigate and making sure that Directors can access YouTube Music and the lowly staff are left with only Spotify. Yesterday it all went to shit (always happens when its a WFH day) and I have users bitching that Teams images are not loading, that attachments in Outlook Web are not loading, and that websites need to be refreshed just to get them to load (That last one got told to me this morning... and thats when I threw my fists up in the air and screamed "F U DNS!!!"
 Changed the DHCP settings, threw ipconfig /release and /renew at a couple of clients to test and you bet your android bottom it worked! 
 I am going to now abuse my internet freedom and watch YouTube videos while I cry into my coffee. 
 By the way... if you have not tried Fortigate then you really should!

 Right now, every server in my DMZ is treated as a stand alone (non-domain) server. No LDAP/domain authentication through the firewall. Responsible parties get local accounts on each server they use. As we place more services (& servers) in the DMZ we are starting to struggle to manage them in terms of permissions, accounts, & lack of group policy.
 We're considering setting up a DMZ domain. Allowing trusts with our internal domains (or not). Or even allowing LDAP & needed things through the firewall & adding them to our internal domain (but this doesn't sound smart).
 What are the common ways you guys are tackling this?

I am seeing soft write/read errors in my backup software. It's not too much (from 5 to 20).

 I thought I would argue a case for them to get new monitors and I was able to get two Samsung 27 inch monitors for each PC. Got them all hooked up the other day and the users on shift that day really liked the upgrade and even though they now had 2 instead of 3 monitors, the overall monitor space was a bit bigger.
 Well fast forward to today and some on shift today were complaining that now they have to resize windows and all that to get the same things on 2 screens that they had on 3 up at once.
 I found MS PowerToys that lets you set zones on the monitors to have program in. And I was playing around and for the most part yes it did work, but there were 2 programs that our users use that would not let me put into a Fancy Zone (the name of the zones). Is there some sort of hidden restriction on why a window would not go into a fancy zone?

Just recently got a new job, doing some higher level infrastructure for a company of 1600 people and 60 locations, with an IT team of 4 (me being the networking guy). I’m just starting to really grasp tunnels, VLANs and trunking concepts in a large company. I’m currently doing network discovery for these locations as they dropped their MSP last month. I worked for a msp previously but we generally supported smaller offices with pretty basic networks without switches, subnets, and VLANs. They use several VLANs across the network at my new job. They’re using fortigates and dell switches primarily. I’m trying to familiar myself with these concepts to help understand the network more.
 Now looking at the static routes on the fortigate firewalls I can see and understand how VLANs and different subnets are communicating. My question is, do you need to setup static routes on a switch with VLANs as well? I’m thinking they would have similar static routes, explaining what IP schemes can communicate over a L3 switch? Or am I overthinking this?
 Thanks for any advice! We’re a small team and sometimes I feel like I have nobody to lean on for questions like this.

 Our business (around 40 people) would like me to implement a ticketing system, preferrably free or low cost.
 One thing they wanted was the ability for them to set their own priority on tickets (lame).
 I imagine I would need a service that provides a webpage for them to create the ticket so they could have that option, rather than sending it to an email.
 Any services like this?
 Edit: I just discovered spiceworks, completely free, allows a user portal with custom attributes so i'm sorted!

The catch is that the lease is still assigned by MAC address, so if a device changes on a remote uni port it wont get a lease until the current one for the old device expires.
 I saw some references from around 2010 that specifying the circuit ID as the primary key for leases was going to be coming "soon". I'm not able to find anything more resent, so I'm assuming it was never actually added, but I'm hoping it's an obscure enough feature that I just don't have the right search terms.

 We bought 6 replacement switches (Catalyst 9200 series). 3 will be in our server-room stack, 2 in a secondary building stack, and 1 at our remote site as a standalone.
 Because I haven't handled an install from scratch before, I was hoping someone could review my sanitized config for the standalone switch. This network is very simple, with a separate router and DHCP handled through our domain controllers.

 You can imagine what this has done. Server 2019 will not allow me to run any dedup operations on the volume, garbage collection nor scrubbing. I deleted a large 2TB file but I'm unable to recover that space. Every Powershell dedup command I attempt to run results in volume out of free space in Event Viewer.

 I've read the Aginet Config Operation Manual but could not find a solution.
 Tried setting the password to "?undefined?" in General config and the SSID as "Name_XXXX_2G" (XXXX should be replaced with last symbols of each device's MAC address, 6.2 - 6.3 in the manual). Tried uploading config straight from the router I've created it with and from Aginet Config Server. No luck. 
 Can anybody please help with some information on how to properly create the Vendor Configutarion Files, including Account Permission Settings and custom SSID with specific router's PIN as wireless key, that fits any newly connected router to network?

 After the work was done, i "no shut: the interfaces. The interfaces lit up, but only one side could see the neighbor. Not able to ping eachother.
 The interfaces are trunks with the native vlan interface IP'd for routing protocols.
 For kicks i issued no switchport and moved the IPs to the interfaces and they came back up and are able to ping eachother.
 So somehow this issue is related to layer 2/vlans. Any ideas?
 fixed ---
 I bounced the side that was not seeing the neighbor, and everything came back up normal. Something must have flaked in that switch when i shut down those interfaces. I checked to make sure that they were in agreement as far as root bridges for vlans, but since the native vlan wasn't coming up, both thought they were the root bridge. I'm assuming that is normal under the circumstances as they could not communicate, but the whole thing is really weird. I would've really liked to have found out what was causing the issue.
 Thanks for all the suggestions, folks!

 As subject says; we have bad address entries in our DHCP pool. Some background:
 2 dhcp servers with failover pools (Windows Server 2022)
 Have a Cisco 4500X for layer 3 routing. This switch has dhcp helper information for each vlan
 Now, the oddities:
 -I can't find any other dhcp server on our network of any kind, in any of the vlans
 -Only certain wired vlans are affected; the data vlans for end user PC's. Our wireless, phone, security camera, clock and management vlans are unaffected.
 -We don't exhaust the pool; we will get a random number of bad address entries, usually about a third of the amount of wired desktop PC's
 -I have set the DHCP lease time to 6 hours, which results in much fewer bad address entries. If I bump it up to 2-3 days or more, I will have double or triple the amount of entries.

 I'm suspecting it might be some of our Dell desktops (optiplex 3060, Win 10 and 11 Enterprise for clients) that is the issue; in the 5 vlans affected, all of the desktops are the same model Dell. For the life of me, however, I'm not sure why this might be an issue. I have sort of a working theory, but have not tested it out yet; the desktops go to sleep at the end of the day; then are woke up by employees the next morning. They try to get their prior address, but it is listed in the scope, so they get another. 
 Anyone else ever have something similar?
 Thanks all!

 I've ssh'd into the both of the switches. The new one has a Mac address table with nothing plugged in. Just noticed the the new switch duplicated the 130 macs from the other switch.

 On Monday my business had some sort of power event that caused our firewall, main switch (hp-2510-48), phone system and one of our active directory/dns servers to power cycle before coming back online.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/networking, 
 I'm relatively new to networking and have a weird circumstance that I'm not sure how to tackle. 
 I connect manufacturing equipment to our client's WAN on a regular basis. Our manufacturing equipement has an internal LAN with the IP scheme, 192.168.100.XXX, and I use a router to NAT to static IPs on our client's network that they provide. 
 It's usually smooth sailing, I configure the router to the dedicated IPs the client provides and we're good to go. 
 My trouble is my client's WAN is 192.168.100.XXX as well. So NATing would be pointless and I cannot reserve all of IPs of my machine on their network. 
 Would there be a good way to not create conflict? My initial thought is to use a VLAN so my equipment's LAN sees the VLAN and their WAN sees the VLAN and neither ever sees each other, I don't actually know if this is possible or the best course of action. Any guidance is much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 ​
  
What I am doing:
  
Testing platform to see disruptions and to check to see if my software can detect these.
 I am sending packets from a IP to a multicast address then to another IP.
 For example: (#1 IP)192.168.1.1 sends it to (#2 Multi)235.1.200.1 and then it goes to (#3 IP)192.168.1.15.
 I am on a external computer (Connected to same network switch). I have been trying to spoof the #1 and 2 IPs. So that the messages goes from #1 to (ME #4) then to the #2 Multi then #4.
 It doesn't really matter the order as long as I can see a loss, delay effect on either end of the network.
 ​
  
What I need:
  
I need a way to intercept and control the flow of these packets. I need to represent a loss of packets, and delay the time which the packets send at.
 ​
  
Things I have tried:
  
I have been using Ettercap and TC Qdisc to try and make this work. I can receive the packets with Ettercap, but when I try and use TC Qdisc it doesn't have any effect.
 I originally tested just going from IP1 to IP2 and used Ettercap to spoof these ips. I then used TC Qdisc to control the loss packets, delay, duplicate, and corruption of these packets and it Does work.
 ​
 In my original test without multicast you would see this on wireshark:
 192.168.1.1 >> 192.168.1.15
 192.168.1.15 >> 192.168.1.1
 ​
 With multicast you would see this on wireshark:
 192.168.1.1 >> 235.1.200.1
 192.168.1.15 >> 235.1.200.1
 I tired getting between the host and multi and tried applying the effects there but no luck. 
 192.168.1.15 >> (ME TC QDISC HOST) >> 235.1.200.1
 ​
  
Question to you:
  
What are my options here. If you have experience with this feel free to share your approach.
 Is there another way to go about this? If so please let me know.
 ​

 It's bizarre.. I'm not used to this. Apparently we're in a "quiet phase", but we'll see. I've tried to remain disciplined and proactive by studying, reading documentation, looking for improvements in things like monitoring and logging. But I think I'm actually better in more chaotic environments.

 Is there a method to just give individual servers internet access as a proxy for all the other servers at that site (like you would do with a WSUS server) and then use delivery optimization or branch cache at each site to distribute the updates internally rather than allowing every server to be able to access the internet?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone. I was looking for some opinions here. I searched for other posts similar to my situation, but I wanted to get some advice since many posts were a few years old.
 We could have better backup storage at my company. Currently, we have two sets of external drives attached to our backup system onsite, sitting in the same room on top of each other. Each set of drives hosts an independent copy of all of our backups. We are also copying a set of these backups into Azure.
 I was permitted to look into upgrading these off-brand external drive enclosures into a rack-mounted solution for Site A and then putting an offsite backup into Site B. I got a quote for a Synology system, but the fact that they're forcing you to use their branded drives doesn't sit well with us. Additionally, it would be about $10-12k for one of these systems - which was more than they wanted to spend on two systems.
 As I was thinking of alternatives, I remembered we have two SuperMicro servers (that we used to use as Hyper-V servers) that aren't being used, each having 16x drive bays in them. Both have 256GB of RAM and plenty of processing power, even though they're ~8 years old. I was thinking of loading TrueNAS Core onto these servers, loading up the bays with storage, using these as our physical backups at sites A and B, and then still copying a set into Azure. I have never used TrueNAS before, but I think it would accomplish what we need. I can also get some 18TB Iron Wolf Pro drives for $300/ea - so ultimately, the cost of this buildout would be the cost of the drives.
 Would you have any thoughts on this setup? Pros/cons? Alternatives I should look at? Our total footprint is 50TB, but we're currently not doing Client Backups or O365 Backups, so that will be my next project - so I need room to expand.
 I appreciate any opinions.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Context:
 We use GSuite for emails, HP M575/577/578 MFPs for our printing and scanning needs. We have our own domain, take it as xx.com
 We have a specific account made for scan-to-email functions, xx.scanner@xx.com
 We have over 20 printers working properly with said account, sending emails of scans properly.
 A few weeks ago, we got 2 new HP M578 MFPs, so we started configuring them for use. Configurations we're 1:1d from older printers, together with network settings according to company policy.
 Using smtp.gmail.com, port 587, TLS enabled. All tests pass, account validates, test email arrives.
 Test with an actual document (300kb in scan size according to other machines) - Nothing
 Test with a blank page - Arrives
 Test with a very basic text document - Arrives - Size is around 30kb
 This is where the weird part comes in, seems like the document size limit is 30kb for some reason. No other printers are experiencing this besides those two. Firmware versions etc all match.
 I tried different DNS settings etc as this was sometimes reported to be the issue, nothing.
 I also read about app passwords, but some places argue that that it isn't needed for Google Workspace/Gsuite accounts and we still have no issues with the account on our older printers.
 Has anyone run into this before and has any recommendations on what else we could try?

 I am working quite some time now to a really nice company that offers a lot flexibility including a lot remote working and although the management would like more of us to be more often to office most people for various reasons (some are living on other cities) are ignoring it.
 This month though there was more pressure like our manager of our team asked us to choose TWO days per month that as a team will be gathering on the office and i see they are trying to establish it especially from January of the next year.
 Thats not a problem for me and its nice to see other members of the team that i dont see often , however i'd like to have the choice especially for summers that i travel a lot to my home country etc to be able to stay longer without having to be in office for just for the sake of being in office.
 So far i have to visit the office maybe even 6 months LOL
 I feel that like a step back in terms of freedom and i am afraid if they get ideas to start asking more days per month...
 I was thinking if there are ways that still i can keep avoiding the presence in office...Like just not comply fully as many other have done in various situations?
 Like maybe attend at first a few times in office but then just only attend one per month or having excuses for not being in office ?bring up health issues or anything ?

 The all run in active / standby mode.
 I have a mixture of ASA5525-X, ASA5545-X and ASA5555-X devices.
 ​
 They all run:
 Current ASA version = 9.8(4)10
 Current ASDM = 7.13(1)
 Current FXOS = 2.2(2.121)
 ​
 I want to upgrade to:
 ASA latest verion = 9.14.4
 ASDM latest version = 7.19.1
 ​
 But what about the FXOS version - do i need to upgrade that ?
 I'm having trouble finding a clear explanation as Cisco documentation invariably points to firepower devices.
 ​
 That said i discovered the document below. 
 https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/upgrade/asa-upgrade/asa-appliance-asav.html#topic_r5l_tt5_bbb
 ​
 Just to confirm i do not have a physical firepower module in any of the ASA devices.
 ​
 Is there a software file I need to download for the FXOS ?
 ​
 Any help much appreciated.

 We have an on-prem Exchange with an Exch relay and AD sync server - i think with bidirectional sync - to our o365 tenant. 
 We have brought back our servers from backups, but havent placed the AD sync server back in prod yet because we were told that Lorenz ransomware sometimes exfiltrate your mailboxes after a ransomware incident by scraping mailboxes after reconnecting AD sync. 
 Do you have any idea how i should approach this?
 I was thinking:
 1) Use global admin in o365 to review any suspicious accounts, privileged accounts etc and identify ones which need a password reset (board isnt letting me do a ful pw global reset :/ ) 
 2) go onto on prem domain controller and do an AD review there for suspicious accounts etc
 3) when both o365 and on prem AD have been reviewed, put the AD sync back into prod but with active sync disabled
 4) then when the server appears to be working, re-enable activesync
 Is there something i'm missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve worked quite a bit with on-prem and Azure setups but am currently planning my first Hybrid rollout. Trying to find a number on how long a device can go without having line of sight to the internal network/DC. 
 With 140ish users we have one, maybe two devices that will spend more than a day at a time away from the office (up to a month I’m told is the max) so we would like to avoid the complexities of configuring Intune and having different management protocols for these two devices but want to make sure how long they can go without checking in. They will still have internet connectivity so they are able to check in with Azure but not the internal network in our current plan. 
 Any advice is appreciated, I can’t find anything about this online and want to make sure we have everything in order before we get too deep in this project.
 Edit for clarification: right this moment these users are using local users and manually copying/emailing any files that need saved in company file shares, etc. We are working to make sure all devices are managed and users and company data are both controlled while having access to company resources when on the road.

 What I feel I would benefit mostly from:
 -How to deploy an easy to maintain application (git, jenkins, docker), general devops stuff. I know how to use these tools in a rudimentary fashion, but I feel I don't know how to put them all together.
 -Popular Python network automation libraries (netmiko, nornir, napalm).
 I already have access to O'reilly's library and Linkedin Learning.
 I've looked at INE but they don't have anything in the area of automation, CBT nuggets looks promising - I'm going to try their 7 day trial. ipspace.net's Individual standard subscription also looks promising.
 What trainings in this area did you have a good experience with and you would recommend?

 We have a group policy issue with our accounts. After performing the recent Cumulative Update for Win10 21H2, the user group policy is not applying. This previously worked.
 We did have RM (UK educational network software vendor) remote in and tell us some GPO changes we made were in the wrong place (GPM, rather than RMMC, the RM management software), but i'm unsure if their changes have affected it. (though i'm sure it worked before they remoted in). RM themselves are as stumped as we are.
 Inheritance looks OK, the GPOs have the right settings, but for some reason, it's just not picking up the user GPO. The affected accounts largely seem to be legacy Roaming Profile accounts that have been converted to UEV.
 Anything i could have missed? Could there be legacy cruft affecting it? Anyone experienced the same sort of issues?
 If this is the wrong place for these sort of questions, ping me and i'll move it :)

 Can someone please help me:
 Simple Network architecture:
 https://imgur.com/a/xYzEAOU
 Cloud management subnet is 192.168.222.0 with a mask of 255.255.255.0 and the Gateway IP is 192.168.222.1 which also runs a DHCP server:
 On the eve-ng host:
 root@eve-ng:~# route
 Kernel IP routing table
 Destination Gateway Genmask Flags Metric Ref Use Iface
 default pfsense.skubsad 0.0.0.0UG 0 0 0 pnet0
 192.168.222.0 0.0.0.0255.255.255.0 U 0 0 0 pnet0
 ​
 Steps to reproduce:
  
​ 
 Add a new Cloud Network on the topology with network type set to Management(Cloud0).
 
 2. Add a new Virtual PC (VPC) to the topology
 3. Connect VPC to Management Cloud. Start the VPC
  
Expected behavior:
 The Interface connected to Cloud 0 on the VPC should get a DHCP assignment from upstream DHCP server (1922.168.222.1).
 Observed behavior:
 No DHCP assignment on VPC interface connected to Cloud 0. However, after static assignment, I'm able to ping upstream DHCP server (192.168.222.1).
 Question:
  
Why no DHCP assignment on VPC interface connected to Cloud 0?
 After static assignment, I am able to ping the DHCP server 192.168.222.1, but it does not pick up DHCP by itself?

 I have a Sophos SG115 that I've just freshly configured and would like to connect a Sophos APX120 to the UTM but I can't seem to get it working. I'm pretty new to Sophos, and firewalls in general, so I'm sure I'm missing something super basic. 
 As it is right now, I have the wireless AP connected to a PoE injector, and then connected to the LAN port of the SG115. The AP turns on and boots fine, but gets stuck on a flashing amber light, which according to the manual means the AP is not claimed by the wireless controller. I'm wondering if maybe I need to create a new DHCP server on the UTM? When I check the IPv4 Lease Table there's nothing listed, so it's clearly not picking up that the AP is connected. Or at least not assigning an IP via DHCP. 
 If anyone has any experience with this and had some tips or guidance it would be super appreciated. 
 Thanks!

 Within the VMWare world, this is easy. A Port group assigned to VLAN 4095.
 Within Hyper-V, I used the Powershell command:
 Set-VMNetworkAdapterVlan -VMName "VM-Name" -VMNetworkAdapterName "DATA" -NativeVlanId 0 -AllowedVlanIdList 1-4094 -trunk 
 Per my understanding, that puts the NIC into "Trunk" mode, allows all VLANs, and doesn't allow a Native VLAN (so only tagged traffic will flow) - I also tried native to 1.
 Unfortunately, from a PCAP it looks like Hyper-V is stripping the 802.1q tag from the frames. So I am seeing traffic from all of the different VLANs - but without their tags. That's not going to work...
 Is there something else that needs to be defined for Hyper-V to pass the tags not just the payload?

 The option to allow TPM was set using GPO and when it's taken off this domain that GPO won't apply but the drives are already encrypted.
 I'm not 100% sure what the behavior will be when it restarts off the existing domain and I don't have a spare physical server to try this on.
 If I have to enter the recovery key that's OK so long as the volumes unlock :)

 While not actually a blank slate, we are currently full embedded into SCCM. We are having plenty of difficulties patching third party applications and don't have the man power to keep packaging apps.
 While we looked and trialed PatchMyPC and worked really well, a subsidiary of ours isn't using MECM and has all their devices enrolled into Intune/Endpoint Manager. This was fine, until we went to enroll the terminal servers, which at that point realised Microsoft doesn't support Endpoint Manager for MS Server.
 So now we are looking at RMM tools to help us with, application deployment and patching. I have come across a number of tools, and NinjaOne seems to be on top. But their pre-sales are frustrating and constantly want me to do a demo session with their techs instead of just giving me a price on the 2500 devices I want to cover.
 I checked out Gartner, but it doesn't do quadrants for this in particular, more so unified desktop management which brings MS Endpoint Manager to the top.
 If anyone could chime in on if you had a blank slate, what would you do? Also the business will not touch SolarWinds with a 10ft pole because of the scandal last year/year before and I have heard mixed reviews on ManageEngine's Desktop Central.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've heard a bit about ChatGPT over the last few days and finally decided to try it out.
 It's.. Incredible at what it does. I asked it, to spin up a series of nodes in AWS with IAC, running one of the applications I support, and also implement DR for those nodes. And within seconds, I had a workable script that did exactly what I had asked it to do. 
 I've run it against a bunch of different scenarios and overall it seems more competent at coding than about 90% of the people I've worked with, myself included.
 Even vaguely querying errors returns answers better than what you'd typically receive from any vendor support over the course of days, in seconds.
 So what are the implications here - where does everyone see the field going? I honestly didn't think we'd get to this point for another several years, minimum. I'm starting to think I might need to re-skill and move over to pure development just to stay afloat in the next few years.

They want encryption, patch management, etc....Also, improving IT/Security isn't where the CU wants to spend their money.
 What's the best way to learn how to harden the network itself internally? Like set up an Active Directory? Where can I sandbox some of this before trying to present it to management? Where can I learn more? If anyone has any tips or ideas, I really appreciate it as I am pretty much on my own on this. Low cost options are appreciated as I will not be reimbursed by my institution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All,
 I am a field engineer for a large MSP. We have never had any good imaging processes. On the day to day pc replacement, we just use the dell default image, go through the oobe and install everything by hand in-person, then manage the rest with our RMM. For a re-image, we just use the media creation tool image and once again go through the oobe, join domain, install software. 
 For large scale replacements, (When win7 went EOL) we had a process where we would upgrade the PC to win10, and then use Macrium reflect to clone the PC onto a brand new PC. This was relatively quick and effective at the time, however over the last 2 years we have had constant issues with a lot of the cloned machines and ended up re-imaging most one by one. 
 I have been asking management to start doing the Dell Image Assist, where we get them from dell mostly pre-imaged, but they decline every time. 
 Well, now, one of our larger clients just had 150 new Pc's delivered, that they need installed, and the ticket has been just dropped onto me to get it done. This would require me to unbox, complete the oobe, rename the PC, join it to the domain, install chrome, adobe reader, office 365, and their specialized software. And then on a per user basis install their respective printers, scanners, other devices. 
 Anyone have any ideas on the fastest way to get these PC's deployed? Sysprep drive duplicating? Creating 1 image and then sysprepping and then trying to clone it out to the rest of them?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reviewing the IP header fields I'm wondering if anyone could shed some light on why the IP version field is 4 bits long if there are only two options: IPv4 / IPv6. This information could be represented as a 1 bit value instead, freeing up 3 bits from every packet traversing the internet. Is there a reason IPv6 did not change this field to be shorter? It seems like freeing up 3 bits of data from this field would yield global improvements in internet efficiency.
 Now look, I realize that there's always smarter people who have thought of something first. So I understand there are likely good reasons for this ineffienct header value. I'm wondering if anyone could tell me why things are set up the way they are.

 I recently took on a new job as a systems engineer, tasked with discovery and replacing equipment in a 1600 person company, across 60 locations, (6 main locations). One of the locations has three Dell N2000 stacks in different parts of the building. I'm not too savvy with switches, or VLANs for that matter, but I'm learning. I'm understanding these concepts more and more every day and how they're applied to this network. I'm currently doing discovery on this building, but I have no GUI/Web interface to log into for two of the three stacks.
 The MDF has no issues. I'm able to log into that via IP address no problem.
 I'm having issues getting into the other IDF stacks. I'm able to putty into them using SSH no problem. Credentials take which is a great sign. But I'm still very green to all of this here, and looking at everything visually is way easier for me then CLI, especially when I'm trying to map out these VLANS and trunked ports, etc.
 Is there anything I need to do to get onto these other stack's GUI? I'm confused as to why just one stack is accessible through GUI, and the others are not.
 Looking for some help on this or pointers! What am I missing here!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I seem to be getting conflicting information on how the IPsec protocol itself handles multiple subnets in a tunnel. I know different vendors have slightly different approaches to this, but I'm more concerned with what's actually possible in the protocol. I've heard the following so far:
  
Multiple subnets are agreed upon in phase 2, all in a single tunnel.
 Multiple phase 2 "tunnels" are created, one for each subnet pair.
 You can't do more than one subnet pair in the IPsec protocol. Therefore, multiple phase 1 tunnels are created, one for each subnet pair.
  
I think the 2nd answer is correct, but I can't seem to find any detailed information from an authority on it without diving deep into the RFC's.
 FWIW, I know it's possible to just make a big 0.0.0.0/0 tunnel and deal with the routing myself, but I'm trying to help a vendor troubleshoot their own stuff on a failover tunnel between us and them. The status on my side shows that in a failover event, only one of the subnet pairs is re-created.
 Edit: I'm now leaning towards the 1st answer because of the below link. It seems that you can have multiple traffic selectors. Some vendors just "show" this information as multiple phase 2 tunnels? But their terminology isn't necessarily accurate, and everything was only negotiated once in phase 2?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm currently trying to help our subsidiary company with installing a new Cisco Meraki firewall.
 Up until this point they have had little to no security built into their firewall. Their old one was basically an allow all rule that configures the firewall like a router. I've told them multiple times this is not acceptable. 
 Long story short I configured the firewall for them, but it did cause some things to break. (I don't actually work in their environment so its hard for me to know everything that goes on) 
 Their environment is somewhat complex as they have multiple vpns belonging to clients. Also obviously clients don't give out all the security details of their programs so its been tough sledding to this point.
 My question is is what would you do if you were in my shoes? Is it not possible to block a lot of ports due to the size of the company? I've only worked at smaller companies so blocking multiple ports has never been an issue.
 I've read about doing network scans for 24 hours and then analyzing this data. The problem is at this point it is hard to differentiate friend from foe as everything is being let in.
 Any advice or anything really would be of major help.
 ​
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am having an issue with static IP's and configuring protection against ARP spoofing on a pretty basic switch ( HPE 1920-48G-PoE+). This switch refers to it as ARP Anti-Attack which is where I configured my trusted ports to other switches and configured it to be enabled on VLAN 1. I have already configured DHCP snooping and everything works as expected as long as a device is using DHCP.
 Now, my issue is with some devices that are using a static IP addresses outside of the DHCP range. My understanding is I should be able to add a static ARP entry in the table for the IP and mac address but for whatever reason it still does not work.
 So my question is:
  
What is the proper way to deal with static IP's when enabling ARP Spoofing? I know I can use DHCP reservations but I want to know how to handle this without DHCP.
 If putting static entries in the ARP table is the solution to handling static IPs, what could be causing my issue with this switch?

 We are 15% Win11 now for our pilot ring, and all new deployments are Win11. No issues save one - an old VPN software from the state. No user or IT complaints so far. Some of our data is under federal regulation and cannot be on unpatched or unsupported systems so being on an unsupported OS is not an option. We have other systems and unregulated data on very old software written for Win XP that has no trouble running on Win11.
 To minimize IT support and troubleshooting and dual documentation for end users, I am hoping to make the transition quickly. Aiming for 100% in the next 12 months, but I suspect that like most of my deadlines that will slip.
 Are you testing Windows 11? What is your timeline for upgrading? Any issues?

I discovered that the cg-nat has a range of IPv4 addresses allocated to it(100.64.0.0/10). Ip checking websites showed me having a public ip address, which is typical for cg-nat, however in the phone settings i had a public ip address in the range of 10.0.0.0/8. From my understanding my ISP is indeed using cg-nat, but why is my private IP address not in the scope of addresses allocated for cg-nat? Am I missing something?

This is the first time I’ve taken time off in my new role and after 4 days I actually miss the job. Been here for about 9 months now and I can honestly say that this is where I want to work for the foreseeable future. The MSP I work for does it all right and ticks all the boxes. Good salary comp for the kind of work I do, social, perks and benefits, company culture, work life balance, useful teammates, you name it. Sure we get dickhead users and silly requests like everyone does, but somehow the way the company manages all of this make this a non-issue.
 All that corporate mumbo jumbo about culture, all the Richard Branson quotes, the LinkedIn posts that talk about stuff - this place actually does all of that, for real, and no one waffles on about it. A recruiter emailed me the other day offering an interview for a position with better working times and 25% better pay and I replies saying not interested before I read the full spec. 
 I don’t have a motivational quote or a moral lesson to finish off on, just felt like sharing. I guess what I want to say is that these places to exist, it just feels surreal.

Certainly, the physical layer lies below the link layer, but the details of the physical layer are probably best left for another course (for example, in communication theory, rather than computer networking).

 Im an IT guy for a small company. The current Cisco 3850 switch is severely outdated and we just purchased a new 9300.
 Since I dont have a lot of Cisco experience, I was using the 9300 to go over some CCNA labs before installing this in production. I made some errors and ended up factory resetting the switch.
 Now, Im getting bootable url's in boot variable not found or exhausted
 please check the rommon configuration or boot command usage.
 ​
 I downloaded the image from Cisco's site, installed and can get back into the webui and run commands and everything seems fine, until I reboot the switch. After rebooting, it get the "bootable url in boot variable not found" message again.I made sure to save my configuration settings before restarting.
 Ive been Googling this for a day and its driving me insane, but Im sure its something stupid that Im missing.
 Any help would be very greatly appreciated!
 ​
 ​
 Edit: If I boot from the USB drive with the image on it, I am able to get to all of my settings. I can take the USB out and get to my webui and all my configurations appear to be there, but if I dont reboot it with the USB, then I get the "bootable url" error.
 It almost seems like maybe the image isnt saved to the switch

We have a user who has left the company who had access to tons of sharepoints, most of which were created before our company was sold to another. So those sharepoints still exist but are essentially never used, except some documents we have are using macros to access old data in them. 
 I want to grant all this sharepoint access to that employee's replacement so she can use these files normally, but for the life of me I cannot find a way to just simply list all of the sharepoint sites a user account has access to. I might be being dumb as hell but I can't find it in 365 admin/sharepoint admin. 
 I just want to see:
 John Doe Sharepoint Access: Site A Site B Site C

 Since the November 2022 Security update when we are prompted for the 'Browse for Folder' dialog on our Windows 11 machines, only "Desktop" is listed.
 Some forum posts have confirmed this to be a problem when using OneDrive desktop redirection but no solution or workaround other than disabling redirection or removing the update. Neither are options in our corporate environment.
 Is anyone else dealing with this and have any ideas for a solution? 
 Many Thanks!

 I use for my core switching datacenter 4 juniper switches,
 2 EX-4600 with 24 port sfp 10G with 2 EX-4300 48 ports RJ45 1G, each 2 models are virtual chassis and connected with 4 qsfp.
 These are legacy I got and dated from 2016.
 I'm interested in replacing them with either cisco or aruba(heard some good things on arista as well).
 Would welcome advise on equivalent newer models and some general and personal experiences you had with them.
 Feel free to suggest other options or anything useful to important things to know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I may have screwed up a bit and need some help. Our IS team ran a Purple Knight scan against our AD environment to look for potential configuration issues. One thing they found was a high number of users that had adminCount set to 1. Their recommendation was to clear the adminCount for all standard users and see how many of them return to an adminCount of 1 the next time SDPROP runs and review the list at that time.
 I inadvertently cleared the adminCount for ALL AD objects instead of just the standard user objects. In other words, the builtin groups that are supposed to be protected were also cleared. When I realized this, I set the adminCount for those groups and 2 users (administrator and krbtgt) to adminCount=1.
 Admittedly, my understanding of how SDPROP works could be way off but my expectation would be that when SDPROP runs, any users of those protected groups should have thier adminCount set to 1, inheritance disabled and their ACL replaced with the same permissions as what are on the AdminSDHolder object.
 However nothing is getting the adminCount set back to 1, not even domain admin group members. I don't know how to check to make sure that SDPROP is running or not. I checked the PDC for the registry entry that controls the SDPROP frequency (HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\NTDS\Parameters\AdminSDProtectFrequency) and it doesn't exist so it should be running every hour by default. I even tried triggering SDPROP manually.
 Any ideas of what I could check next or what I might be missing? Do I need to set adminCount=1 on the AdminSDHolder object?

 Im trying to understand what the difference is between the Cisco ASA vs FPR vs FTD. 
 When reading documentation, ASA is replaced by the NGFW: Firepower. The ASA lacked for example IPS and had a basic software. The FPR can now provide URL filtering, application control etc.. 
 But.. how is the FPR managed compared to the ASA? Do you managed it via CLI or GUI (or both)? What more differences are there between these two more than the above stated? I also read about the FTD, what does this exactly do? It seems to me that FTD is a software, but what does it run on?
 I probably mix all of these but I would like some clarification.

 Do you use a normal TCP Proxy?
 We currently do and experience sound/video quality problems that are bad enough to annoy the users.
 As we would rather like to continue to have all internet traffic go through a proxy we consider trying a SOCKS proxy. So, does anyone have experience with Webex through a SOCKS proxy? Does it help to mitigate latency problems?
 If yes, how do you redirect the UDP data stream to the SOCKS proxy? We use PAC scripts to redirect traffic depending on URL but that doesn't help to sort the UDP and TCP traffic to their respective proxy.

My company appears to use Jamf as its Mac MDM and I haven’t fully explored to see if there are any keyloggers/spyware installed etc. However, I was just wondering what the risks are with adding my personal Apple ID to my work machine? It’s worth noting that I don’t intend to check any of the boxes in the iCloud system preference page; this would purely be for handoff features and the like and I wouldn’t synchronise any services such as iMessage, photos, iCloud Drive etc (although maybe private relay could be useful). As far as I know, to get features like universal control and unlock with Apple Watch to work you need to have both an iPad and a MacBook on the same primary Apple ID as even things like notes and reminders don’t work with a secondary Apple ID.

 We are located in a secure facility that requires background checks for all vendors. We also have a contract with Canon copiers to service them whenever they break down or need replacing. We have a copier that is broken but our facility won't let the techs in without the background check. Canon is not being cooperative in allowing their techs to complete the BG check. I believe the techs may not even have social security numbers which is holding things up. The facility won't let the techs enter in without the clearance.
 I (on-site help desk) will be out starting next week for the holidays.
 I have a few options I can think of:
  
Short term, wait until tech gets cleared, but they haven't been responsive
 Bring copier outside the facility and somehow tech can service it out on the street? This seems counter intuitive and hard to do.
 Get tools from Canon directly and fix myself?
 long term, get a smaller copier (that IT can fix) not on a contract and/or eliminate the contract with canon.
 Resign my position as the facility is preventing me from doing my job which is to coordinate these things

As far as I know user have been using to login to PC with Microsoft account and decided to make local account, I think they tried migration because there is only local account visible at login screen. After restart login failed with message "the user profile service service failed the sign-in. User is not the biggest deal but bitlocker. In order to fix User profile there is a ways to do so like using Regedit and I have done it in the past, but I can't get to recovery CMD or safe mode because of bitlocker asking to enter key to unlock the drive. Plus, recovery key is not present in Microsoft account. Does any solution exist for this?

 I have a situation where we're moving people across to azure only managed devices and that means their accounts don't need to be domain joined anymore, as the only thing requiring domain authentication was the old domain joined computer log in screen.
 Initially we were moving the accounts to an unsynced organisational unit and then re-enabling the deleted accounts in azure to break the link, but we found that this had the side effect of removing their private channels on teams due to teams channels not being managed via an assigned group.
 Is there any way to pause adsync, move the on-prem account to the disabled OU, then just set the accounts on-prem sync to false on an individual account basis?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello !
 ​
 First of all, sorry if i make gramatical/technical mistakes, English is not my first language.
 So, recently, my company started to use Azure AD for using Office 365 with a federated Domain. We set a SSO with Shibboleth linked to our main domain. Then, if a user try to connect to the domain, it redirect them on the CAS page, and if they're already connected, allow the authentication. This was done with our network engineers, actually in charge of the OpenLDAP (one of the domain is on Samba 4 and the other only have and LDAP and no samba)
 ​
 Since then, we though of some amelioration and I was trying to log in windows with work account (so an account present in the azure A.D). It works for the account in managed domain, but doesn't for the federated domain.
 ​
 I know it's logical since the Windows authentication can't redirect them to our CAS, but I read online that some people can login with federated domain username and password. My question is, how ?
 ​
 I believe the main mistake was during the first implementation of the SSO with the command Set-MsolDomainAuthentication. We used the command as :
 Set-MsolDomainAuthentication -DomainName $OurDomain -federationBrandName $FederationBrandName -LogOffUri $LogoutUrl -Authentication Federated -PassiveLogOnUri $LogonURI -SigningCertificate $certData -IssuerUri $uuri -PreferredAuthenticationProtocol SAMLP 
 We didn't use "ActiveLogonUri", but I'm not sure if this is usefull, nor really sure about what that property can do. Still, this command work for the web-based applications but obviously not for Windows authentication 
 Is this the problem or am I completly out of place ? Do you have any idea about the origin, or a solution ?
 ​

 I was thinking of using just two AC or U6 pro APs in "standalone mode" and connecting them to a router & switch I already have. Pretty much a "dumb access point"
 Is it worth it to get Unifi access points for this or are there cheaper alternatives that would do the same (since you do pay a premium to have everything "just work" with ubiquity" Any suggestions are appreciated!

 Have a quick question regarding the above. 
 We have SPF enabled for just spf.protection.outlook.com and that’s sufficient enough I believe. So only things sent from M365 will allow outbound mail. 
 DKIM is setup via DNS and our 365 admin centre. And this seems fine. 
 But here’s where I’m a bit confused. We have dmarc enabled and it was set to quarantine. So all mail that fails SPF and DKIM will go into spam? Is this for inbound or outbound mail? I thought DMARC was for outbound, but a 3rd party trying to email us, got an error showing DNS Auth: DMARC failed.
 Is this an issue on our end?

 ​
 TLDR; Does SMS store failed files/directories in its logs?
 Having completed an inventory scan I've got around 300 failed folders which i can't seem to find any reference for in the logs (obtained using the StorageMigrationServiceHelper PowerShell Module)
 I've tried using AccessEnum to query folders i don't have permissions to and it comes back with Access being in place except 1 file. It also seems to only return a small fraction of items with the default or 'display only files that have permissions less restrictive than parent' on
 Have ran various PowerShell scripts to query access also and around 100 items are path too long etc but this still doesn't match the number of failed folders on D and G drives.
 Seems like i'll end up migrating whats been inventoried so that it gets the bulk over and creates the shares (won't be using the cutover) and then likely Robocopy the rest but id obviously rather have the SMS takes care of things for me.
 ​
 Any advice/ insights would be appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I discovered that 463 of the 1801 Dutch government domains are unnecessarily vulnerable to code injection and XSS attacks due to the use of static `nonces` in the Content-Security-Policy. A `nonce` should not be guessable and should be generated randomly on every request. The official documentation is clear on this: https://www.w3.org/TR/CSP3/#security-nonces.
 I have reported to the National Cyber Security Center (NCSC), and they confirm the incorrect implementation but do not consider it a security problem. "We will, therefore, not process your report further," said an anonymous employee. In addition, I was still imposed that I may not disclose which domains are involved.
 I stumbled upon this problem by chance and selflessly took the trouble to map out the scope of the problem and report it properly. I am not in this for a bounty or anything; I just wanted to help out.
 It is disappointing to see that the Dutch government cannot implement basic security measures according to specifications to protect visitors against malicious parties. This was an absolute waste of my time.

 I'm now asking for any suggestions on some concrete metrics that we could monitor or just any ideas for performance monitoring.
 Luckily our boss is really cool about this process and we can define all the metrics and what is a successful day/week/month ourselves.

 Because at the moment, the way we keep track of laptops is an Excel workbook that I have NOW scripted to find duplicates automatically. Before I started the only tool was an Excel workbook without any checks. So completely manual all the way.
 Obviously super inefficient and unsafe, the thing is. I haven't been able to find a better solution.
 What do you guys use to keep track of employee laptops?

 The environment:

 The issue:
 Has been running fine for years. Abruptly, Monday morning, apache started consuming 100% CPU and using all available swap. httpd-error.log is full of

 If I stop and restart apache, all goes back to normal for a few minutes, and then starts again.

 ​
 Throughout the year we've been progressively working on improving email hygiene for our clients, this includes add SPF failure (hard-fail and hard-error) quarantining in the email security platform. 
 ​
 the big player has reached out to our client several times, saying we're blocking their email. I've tried to reach back, to find the right person, people or team in in the organisation and asked the few contacts I actually have to help me find the wrong person. Their response is "none of our other clients are reporting this problem, you just need to white list us."
 ​
 Here's the thing. They have two SPF records, which fails just on that alone. they have no DKIM keys. They have DMARC configured using proofpoint, but basically acheiving nothing (p=none). 
 My response is, well, they need to fix their shit. They created these SPF records, someone must be responsible for it. For us to just white list them (considering the industry) is, imo, the wrong decision to make because it then opens up our client to the risk of receiving fake and/or malicious emails from this sender. 
 ​
 I've communicated with my client serveral times about the issue. So far they haven't explicitly (or otherwise) told me to white list it and I know they trust my judgement.
 ​
 So, Am I the Asshole here, for trying to protect my client (and, I suppose the sender, who is ASX50) and trying to refer it back to them to fix their problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well guys Ive got a question I need some insight on. After working as a sysadmin at a company for 17 years I was let go today.
 My manager says I was let go for having issues one too many times. And I have made mistakes. Ive tried to correct those and move one. The straw that broke the camels back was when a script Ive run for years to reset system account passwords went sideways and accidentally locked out like 50 service accounts. 
 But Im about a decade away from retirement and I was burned out there. Over the years management has expected more and more out of my team and I admit as I gotten older Ive had more and more trouble staying sharp and motivated.
 If I stay in IT how do I spin "hey Im 50+, and got burned out at my old job"?
 Im even thinking I may not want to stay in IT. What do you guys think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About two years ago I started at a small/medium business with a few hundred employees. We were almost all on prem, very few cloud services outside of MS365. The company previously had one guy who was essentially "good with computers" set things up but they grew to the size where they needed an IT guy full time, which isn't super unusual.
 But the owner was incredibly cheap. When I started they had a few working virtual host servers but they had zero backups - absolutely nothing on prem was being backed up externally. In my first month there I went to the owner and explained how bad things would be if we didn't have any off site backups we were doomed. I looked into free cloud alternatives but there wasn't anything that would fit our needs.
 Management was very clear - the budget for backups is $0, and "nothing is going to happen, you worry too much"
 So I decided to do it myself. I figured out how much I could set aside each week and started saving. I didn't make a whole lot but I did have extra money each month. I was determined to have a disaster recovery plan, even if they didn't want to pay for it.
 And some of you may remember, Hurricane Ian hit a few months ago. We were not originally predicted to take the brunt of it, and management wanted no downtime, so we did not physically remove the server from the premises. The storm damaged the building and we experienced some pretty severe data loss. 
 So it was time for my disaster recovery plan. The day after, we gathered at the building and discovered the damage. After confirming we had lost data, I said "I quit," I got in my car, and lived off the 6 months of savings I had. Tomorrow I start my new job. Disaster recovery plan worked exactly how I planned.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Posted this over at /r/aws but it got flagged for moderation, so giving it a shot here). 
 I've worked for 5 years in AWS/devops/etc. in large companies where this was already established and we had an on-premise network, so we had the full bells and whistles of Direct Connect.
 Now I've joined a startup and we're setting up our own AWS environment, and establishing private connectivity from scratch is uncharted ground for me. As a startup, we are essentially all "floating" right now --- we don't have a dedicated office with a dedicated network range, or any sort of on-premise presence.
 But, we need a way to access EC2, RDS, etc. without public IP addresses (and preferably without a publicly exposed bastion/jumpbox to get there). We don't have anything massively critical, and we will grow, so by the time we do, we can revisit this to really flesh out a sturdy solution. But right now I just need some basic items I can go through to ensure only our people can access our AWS resources.
 For VPN options that aren't site-to-site, "Client VPN" seems like an option: https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/networking-and-content-delivery/introducing-aws-client-vpn-to-securely-access-aws-and-on-premises-resources/
 If someone can just tell me if I'm warm or cold on this, and point me in the direction of the necessary service/tool that I need, that would be great. Thanks!

I quickly responded that it was and went about my business. I then received a meeting request show up in my email box. It included HR VP, Legal, Recruiting and the CFO.
 Initially I didn't think about it because I was busy. Then as I slowed down and thought about it and all weekend I freaked myself out about it. Why was HR calling me and why was legal included.
 I sheepishly walked into HR office today not knowing what to expect. As it turns out they want to replace the applicant tracking system and needed my support.
 I relayed my angst to the HR folks before the meeting got going. They thought it was funny and laughed it off about a guilty conscience. 
 How many ways can an IT guy mess up and not even know it? HR Should be more thorough in their communications.

 Add device to Solarwinds and then Solarwinds populates Netbox with all device information?
 OR
 Populate the device in Netbox and then it adds the device to Solarwinds
 The issue here is circular dependency, Netbox should be the ultimate SoT meaning it dictates the intent whether to have the device in the network in the first place or not, how the interfaces should look like, IP addresses etc.., so in a sense, it must be the entry point. but at the same the device needs to be populated first to see that are the interfaces, IPs etc.
 in a sense both should be diff'ed to see the actual vs intended and point out if there's a deviation, but i'm not sure what's the best approach to start integrating both. any thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My friend just told me he was checking out PortMaster, which I wasn't familiar with. I took a brief glance at their page and some of Safing's documentation (which I believe sounds like an extra service on top of the open source portmaster), and I'm trying to understand -
 Is this essentially application filtering, but on a local firewall as opposed to a network device? 
 I understand portmaster itself is open source and very configurable and safing has some extra services they've built that portmaster can leverage, but ignoring all that portmaster is more or less a software firewall kind of like pfsense, just for your local machine?

 Our current vendors are having supply chain issues, so I'm open to other options. 
 Cost is a bit of an issue, as the consumer ARPU isn't that high. 1G is fine, 10G is lovely, but not at any price. Must have either SFP or BiDi optics.

The two PDUs provided by the DC are horizontal and on the bottom of the rack and supply 208v power with c14 locking outlets. After a mix of multiple 1U/2U servers, routers, and switches that all have redundant power supplies I am both out of outlets and the bundle of power cables on the side is out of hand. I used some d ring but those also take up 1U since the server rails are the nice quick install ones from HP/Dell. The DC has suggested Y splitter cables which I would like to avoid as they seem a point of failure. I wanted to know how anyone has solved this in the past? Are there d-rings that work with server rails, is there some nice way to organize this that I don't know?

 I've setup everything, so, policy sets (and everything that goes with it), Meraki SSID side of things and a Guest Portal, Guest Type, Sponsor Portal and a Sponsor Group.
 When a user logs in they get redirected to the Guest Portal, where they are given the chance to register and then from there they register fine, an approval email goes out, as well as me seeing the account created on the Sponsor Portal to, I approve the account. I can see the username/pw etc... but when the user tries to login with the creds, it fails with an Authentication Failed error.
 The guests are registering their devices in the GuestEndPoints internal store (but not showing up in there)
 In the logs I can see the users request actually pass and being permitted also (so it passes the check on the GuestEndPoints store to, I think because this laptop has already logged in tbf on the network many times prior to this)
 But for whatever reason I cannot get the user to login.
 I have 2 authorisation policies in the policy set to, the second one matches on the wireless type (wireless MAB) which is what shows up in the logs, the first in the chain is a policy that matches on the wireless authentication type again (wireless MAB) but also the Radius Case being "Guest Flow" also, with the VLAN authorisation profile I want to give the guest. I assumed this is done via somekind of CoA on ISE after the user is approved, but this policy never shows up in the logs and is never hit

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good afternoon,
 I have a question for the folks who work in big ISPs who perform CGNAT and PBA for customers. 
 What happens when a customer requires a new port block to be allocated, and the current IP they have the port block for has all ports exhausted? Theoretically, whatever devices should try to free up port blocks for that IP, but if it can't, I assume the user gets a different port block on a different public IP. Now the user has 1 port block on one IP and another port block on a different IP. 
 I can imagine how this would impact various applications, but would like someone who runs this in a large production environment to shed some light on this.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got a very simple playbook to use cisco.iosxr.iosxr_command from the galaxy collection for iosxr to push some raw config commands.
 It works against the ASR9k platform, but not against an NCS540 with no changes to code or connect method or any of the host/group vars compared to what I'm doing for the ASR chassis.
 The error isn't specific to a config not being liked, but rather it's like it's failing to connect (I've tried with AAA in place and using local creds only even though there's no login specific error).
 ​
 The error I'm getting is "msg": "[Errno -2] Name or service not known" when it goes to run the first task. the full verbose traceback which states it may not be related to the actual failure only references 2 things.... some iosxr.py file from the collection itself, line 179 get_capabilities.... capabilities = Connection(module._socket_path).get_capabilities() and a reference to a connection.py file in ansible module_utils line 200 in __rpc__ raise ConnectionError(to_text(msg, errors='surrogate_then_replace'), code=code) followed by my task that just sends configure terminal and some simple logging commands.
 ​
 I've confirmed all of the commands work fine on the NCS platform. The error is the same regardless of if I use any other iosxr method like for banners or logging which is why I tried switching to iosxr_command to rule out any weirdness but it's still there and only when pushing to the NCS540.
 I'm using network_cli for the connection and iosxr for the network_os in the group_vars vars file for this platform, same as the ASR.
 ​
 Any ideas? Any help is appreciated!

 What do you think? Where can I make sure they are actually in sync and back up each other?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 Not a network expert by any means so would like some insight or direction as to whether this is an issue or I'm barking up the wrong tree etc.
 Our client uses this ZScaler App to route all traffic to a UK range they host.
 Example IP would be: 165.225.16.240
 IF I ping this IP there is some loss of packets, ranges between 2-5%. If I ping Google there is no packet loss.
 When I do a traceroute there is always packet loss at the Zayo hop:
 Tracing route to 165.225.17.15 over a maximum of 30 hops:
 1 1 ms <1 ms <1 ms 192.168.99.1
 2 23 ms 32 ms 1 ms 62......
 (Exits Network Gateway)
 3 1 ms 1 ms 1 ms 212......
 4 6 ms 4 ms 2 ms 62.........
 5 8 ms 2 ms 7 ms ge-3-3-0.mpr1.lhr3.uk.above.net [195.66.236.76]
 6 3 ms \ ** ae9.cs1.lhr15.uk.eth.zayo.com [64.125.24.210]
 7 \ * * Request timed out.*
 8 8 ms 6 ms 9 ms 94.31.30.187.IPYX-069051-042-ZYO.zip.zayo.com [94.31.30.187]
 9 4 ms 4 ms 10 ms 165.225.17.15
 Another reading.. before it reaches the ZScaler service:
 Host Longitude Latitude Location Name Packet Sent Packet Received Loss
 ae9.cs1.lhr15.uk.eth.zayo.com 37.751 -97.822 United States 300 80 73.333336
 ae12.mpr3.lhr8.uk.zip.zayo.com 37.751 -97.822 United States 300 252 16
 ZScaler confirmed nothing to do with them, a third party ISP. So am I looking to engage with our ISP about this you reckon?
 Or am I just barking up the wrong tree and this is nothing to be worried about?
 The client say they are being disconnected random times.. when I check the on-site MX i cant see any issues with latency or packet loss etc.. no downtime of any sort.. i can only think the zscaler service is going down and maybe confusing the clients network adapter switching from zscaler back to lan etc..
 Anyway can someone let me know if this Zayo route is a ISP issue or ZScaler.
 Cheers.

 I just accepted an offer with my old employer after getting fed up with poor corporate culture and being asked to handle too many tasks in the 11 months I have been with new job. I was going to walk from my new job almost immediately but I decided to keep working through my disdain for my current employer. It didn't work out. I am burned out after less than a year. Now I have a heaping plate of projects that I am going to leave up for my Director of IT to deal with all by himself. I'm honestly terrified to hand in my letter of resignation I see it ending with getting screamed at by the IT Director followed by him having a stroke. The place I am at now needs a whole IT Department I carry all the Infrastructure Engineer, Network Engineer, Systems administration and Help Desk Duties for a $500M a year company.
 I would honestly just walk out if I didn't live in such a small community. I would run into the people I fuck over pretty frequently if I did.

 UPDATE:
 Haha I haven't drafted a resignation letter yet and just had 2 more projects dumped on me.

 I have a virtual machine, that multiple users join via Remote Desktop, and they all use the same local user (MACHINENAME\USERNAME) so they all have the exact same everything everywhere including applications;
 Problem is that, being more than 5 users, they don't really know when or if someone else is already connected to it, so they always kick out one each other without notice;
 Is there a way to prevent this? Could I limit the number of remote sessions or to "lock" it until someone disconnects? Or even just find a way for them to see if someone's already using it?
 Thank you very much in advice, have a great day!

 So I have a Microsoft Surface Tablet that is going to be deployed in a public facing area. Essentially, it will be on a website with two options, the main one being to print a label that a user has been emailed. Clicking that button opens the camera and scans a QR code, once code has been read it will prompt the user to click a print label button where i'd like it to silently print said label to an attached label printer. The site is all working and tested fine.
 So i've created an intune profile for the browser, using Microsoft Kiosk Browser app rather than Edge so that it displays fullscreen with no navigation bars etc. There is an additional configuration profile setup to Force Allow the browser access to the camera. The first part works fine, However the print page takes me to an error page (the page works in normal edge so i know it works) the error shows:
 sorry that file type is unsupported blob:[mywebsiteaddress] 
 So i'm assuming that the Kiosk Browser app doesn't support printing?.
 If i then change the browser in the configuration profile to MS Edge, printing will work fine, however, its not a full screen browser window and has navigation options, I still get the prompts to allow the camera, and I also get a print dialog screen which i really don't want. 
 My questions are:
  
Can someone pin point where that first error might come from with regards to printing in the Kiosk Browser app
 If not, is there a way or an option that im missing to force edge into full screen mode and allow the camera access and disable the print screen.
  
The Kiosk Browser is the prefered option.

But one of my (very tightly wrapped) users actually timed it today and reports it was 4 minutes and 48 seconds from turning on the power to being able to open an email this morning. How does that compare with what other folks see?
 There is an after work beer awaiting the results of this very unscientific poll.
 Edit: No roaming profiles. Laptop with an SSD. This is at the office not WFH.
 I won't able to FIX this. The GPOs are set WAY above what I can modify. But tell me if this is stupid slow or typical in a corporate environment pretty please?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to implement a central access policy on a file share that will secure files that have not been classified by FCI from everyone but the owner/creator of the file. The issue is that with office files, a hidden lock file is created when an Office file (docs, xlsx, etc.) is opened by a user. This file contains the meta data for who has a file locked in case someone else on the network tries to open it. Since they are unable to access the file, a message states the file is locked by "User" instead of the actual user's name.
 The only identifying features I can find for these files are the first 2 characters of the file name are always ~$ and that their file properties lists HSA as attributes.
 Is there already an AD attribute I can use for FCI that can reference either the first 2 characters of the file name HSA attribute of the file so I can allow read only access?

 We have 10 48port switches
 The rack was punched down to spread the wireless access points, phones, and currently unused ports across the switches for power budget and to keep all the eggs out of one basket.
 The budget for new computers didn't go through so we have at least the rest of the school year.
 Does having all these slow devices hinder the other items in the switch? What about some of the 10mbps Devices like access control, intercom links, and VOIP phones?
 Would it be better to put all the 100mbps Macs on one switch where they can be in the slow lane on their own?

 My newish job has a bunch of technologies I'm not that familiar with. Ansible, kubernetes, docker.. it's predominantly a Linux environment. I'm thinking of spinning up a lab that can somehow incorporate all these elements.
 How do you guys manage your own personal labs these days? Is it still best to get a physical server? I'm traveling around a lot so a cloud based solution would be ideal, unless I setup wake on LAN with a server or something. 
 I suppose if it's a bunch of Linux VMs they'll be fairly low resource requirements so maybe it wouldn't be too costly in the cloud.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So basically I have several Jetson (embedded device with Ubuntu-like system) devices running some ML/MV applications in a site, these devices should connect to some network, either through Ethernet or WiFi.
 I want to be able to monitor the status of the devices, update files and start some actions on the devices. 
 Essentially I need some network-wide remote access to the devices.
 Any ideas how can this be achieved ? or what type of network should I look for ? Is there something similar I can get inspiration from ?
 The network should be able to endure high bandwidth of data exchange (20-300MBs).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m using Robocopy to migrate files from our production file server to an archive file server.
 I have performed a dry run and the total dataset summarised is 3TB and approximately 2M files.
 On the production server (Windows 2016) I run the data dedupe service, and we achieve a huge benefit from this as the volume is 2TB but the data on it is around 4TB and I have .5TB free space reported. My current Deduplication rate for the production volume is 67%
 If I run my live Robocopy job to migrate the folder that has 3TB reported will it retain the deduplication when moved or will it try to move 3TB of data onto the volume? Essentially undoing the dedupe.
 My Archive server has 1.1TB free space on the data volume (which is the same size as our production file server at 2TB) and also has deduplication service enabled.
 I do have the capability to spin backups of these VMs up in a lab to test the move works but with that amount of data it will take quite some time, so hoping someone here can provide some insight into their experience moving similar sized datasets.
 Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title says, what makes you believe online password managers like LastPass, 1Password etc are really end to end encrypted, there are no intentional backdoors or that they won't sell your passwords to any 3rd party? Is it just their privacy policy? 
 Or is it just the fact that the benefits of using a password manager at all greatly outweighs the risks of password manager company "turning to the dark side"?
 By using a password manager, you are in fact completely trusting your digital identity and privacy to them. If I were any government's agency, I'd sponsor my own password manager so that all people are willingly handing their identities over to me and I wouldn't even need to move a finger...
 Personally, I'm using KeePass which is open source so that much wider community is able to review it's code for possible weaknesses and, more importantly, backdoors. I'm also using a composite master key to unlock the database. One part is stored locally on my devices while the other part is a password that I regularly type. This way I can keep my password reasonably short for greater convenience and still practically impossible to brute-force by anyone that could possible get hold of my database. This enables me to keep the database in the cloud, which I also do not trust.

Thankfully we've employed another person to deal with helpdesk and minor issues last year, so that's good. Backup system is decent. Hopefully we will be buying a tape library in the next year to bullet proof it. People call me or inform me when they get suspicious email without opening attachments or clicking links.
 Now for the main thing. Since the ransomware we had in daughter company in 2019, every time someone contacts me with a computer, server or other it issue or I get an alarm from our systems I almost get a panic attack. Same thing when something unexpected happens when working on my pc whether it is a warning or a window pops up or a random web page stops responding for a second or two. It was not that bad in the beginning but the last 6 months were bad to the point I think of quitting without another job lined up. I have the monetary means to do it, but I would rather dealt with the issue.
 Talking with my boss and the owner is definitely on my list. How else can I deal with it?

 Running in other Hyper-V I have another Windows VM for this test. This computer has its own Virtual Switch.

 On my Cisco CBS350, I have VLAN1 and VLAN103.
 My DHCP server is connected to a trunk port. Its IP is 192.168.93.2.
 My test client is connected to an access port, that is part of VLAN103.

 We used to all (4 of us) just operate out of a shared mailbox. A lot of the time we’d double or triple-up on work because of the shared mailbox. We would all unknowingly work on the same thing. 
 I like the system because I have a clear list of things to work on and if I start working on something I pick it up and it’s mine. If one of the other guys starts working on it, since I’m generally faster I can be like “bro, gotta pick up what you’re working on.” (That sounds more asshole than I mean, I swear)
 Boss’ main complaint is he can’t easily tell what we’re all working on without going into our individual queues. He feels out of touch with what we’re doing. 
 So does anyone have any suggestions for a ME SD+ report that can show him what we’re currently working on and have for the last X days? Something he can quickly run to make sure we’re doing our jobs? We’re hosted so any grand ideas I have for report options are limited, and the interface is lacking (at least for me). Tried posting similar requests on the ME sub but it’s moderated to hell and nothing has been approved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[noob question: I have four physical windows 10 pro PCs connected to a ml350p HP gen 8 running windows 2016 server (which has 3 virtual desktops) for my small business. My team connects to their physical or desktop PC remotely. ML350p is my domain controller. Assume I only use ML350p for the virtual desktops and to share files.
 All good. Except the ml350p is in my flat. It's big, throws off heat and can get get quite noisy.
 What to do?
  
AWS virtual desktops seem really expensive eg 67 USD per month per standard desktop.
 I could get an AWS windows server but then how do i connect my physical desktop PCs to it on the domain, i think i need a VPN?
 I have [unused] one drive for business so i could get rid of the ml350p and get a few more desktops and restrict one drive for business to those physical PCs (for security i can't let any personal PC access the one drive)
 Could I (eg) get a t3.2xlarge aws server (USD ~ 400 per month) and create seven desktop VMs on that? or would i need more windows licences/Ad server/costs?
  
I am happy to have a few more physical desktops that people remote into. I want to get rid of the physical server. I still don't really get it - option 4 would be USD 4800 per year. i could buy a new physical server and a 2019 licence for that and then save the 4800 per year.
 I am desktop PC proficient, (build my own), pretty numerate but I find windows server really opaque. I am lost in the jargon and the options.

I realize the best scenario here is to use a completely separate set of cables and switches for the DMZ network, but I'd like to avoid this if I can for the sake of this consideration.
 As a hypothetical example for the purposes of this question, I have a router, a Layer 2 managed switch, some user PCs, and a server running a publicly-accessible website.
 I have two VLANs I want to use, VLAN2 and VLAN3:
  
VLAN2 is the LAN, the user PCs are connected to this. The switch is configured to tag to VLAN2 the incoming untagged packets from user PCs on the VLAN2 ports.
 VLAN3 is the DMZ for WAN traffic the firewall permits through to ac…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m looking for some guidance in the right direction. I’m familiar with the basic concepts of networking but there a few concepts i am looking to understand better. 
  
The first revolves around BGP in the data center. I understand that this is really dependent on what your doing/goal. To lay this out based on my lab in EVE-ng let’s say I’ve got two nexus switches. Each one handles an ISP connection. The ISPs have 2 /30s and we are advertises out a /24. Does it make sense to have the switches handle the BGP or is it more common practice to have a device dedicated to that and the switches handle things like vxlan/spine leaf topology. 
 
How do firewalls get implemented? I can’t imagine data center firewalls would be doing router on a stick and the wan side just points to whatever is advertising the BGP? I guess I’m thinking of this as a regular office firewall but I can’t quite figure out how to google implementing a firewall into a data center.

 Based on the documentation, the falling threshold for storm-control can be equal to or lower than the rising threshold. Why would I need to make them equal? And how would the CPU know when to block and unblock if it had different instructions for the same value? 
 Something to do with the time interval?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work in a small team supporting a large HPC cluster, and because we’re a small team we rely on support contracts via our hardware vendors to ship out replacement parts and send out service techs to our data centers to fix them.
 Trying to get techs on site to fix hardware is borderline impossible compared to pre-2020. I have to follow up dozens of times to get techs out after repeated no-shows.
 We’re a Lenovo shop and that means most hardware support is done by IBM, (some part of the Byzantine IBM/Lenovo deal back in the day I’m sure). I’m not sure if this is just usual pain from IBM circling the drain or if other people are noticing this with different vendors as well? Lenovo is great at shipping out the parts but getting the tech on site is simply not happening anymore which really reduces the value of the warranty imo.
 What are your experiences with getting vendor hardware support? Are you all having better experiences with Dell or HPE?

I do not want to have the remote desktop tool installed on their physical machines at work. I also don't want to assign a specific VM to a user, they should just automatically connect to a VM in the pool. Any recommendations or suggestions are much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Afternoon Everyone,
 I'm currently tasked with researching new possibilities to upgrading our current storage solutions to better fit our future and development.
 A little background on our data. We accumulate around 4PBs of data per year or so and that data rarely gets purged or removed. It is usually acquired in 2 GB files, TBs at a time. (20+ TBs per collection).
 This data gets processed on local machines or GPU/CPU clusters.
 Data is stored raw and processed.
 We currently use JBOD raids but we've found that with data storage being in the PBs, we are setting up new PB raids every few years or so and essentially "upgrading" them means rebuilding with new HDDs or just buying a whole new rack/raid. We also have an insane amount of file shares because of each raid.
 Would a scale out solution like CEPH or GlusterFS be a better solution? Would we be better off keeping RAID configurations? What other solutions could provide for this?
 I had a hard time wrapping my head around which solution would be best because of I/O density/etc.
 We aren't against vendor supported builds but would prefer to learn and grow our experiences in storage to provide direct support later down the road and grow our professional portfolios.
 Funding and time aren't huge issues, and we've been given some funds to build a small "proof of concept" for whichever system we can find that fits the criteria. This would include training/etc.

However, I have learned enough to be able to set dual-mode/native vlans on ethernet ports (1/1/1-1/1/24) but I can't seem to get the same process to set dual-mode/native vlans on fiber ports (1/2/1-1/2/4). I have tried from the command line as well as the web interface. The VLANs page in the configuration looks correct - every vlan is tagged (except the default vlan) and then dual-mode is set on the native vlan that I want. However, when I got to the fiber port, it will still show vlan 0 as the native vlan even if I have set dual-mode on vlan 999.
 I know I'm missing something but my searches so far have turned up nothing. Thanks for any help you can provide.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, my company is in the planning stages for a fairly significant roll-out of new hardware spread across our province. This is happening in the next 8-12 months.
 We will have ~3,500 locations and each location will be getting a minimum of 1 new device, some will be getting as many as 6 or 7 devices.
 The idea is on a certain date and time, all of these devices will be powered on in small window (1-4 hours) on a exact date. This is a regulatory requirement, so we can't pre-load or delay load to these devices.
 Each device will have to download 1-5 files from our system hosted in AWS via one of two of our datacenters The files will be 10-20MB in size. We have a Direct Connect connection from both of our DC's to AWS.
 ~2,800 of these sites use LTE and are on a private APN, they route to our 2 datacenters via MPLS circuits from our Telco. The speed at these sites averages between 15-20Mps.
 The remaining 700 or so sites use Internet, and route to our 2 datacenters via a pair of Internet circuits from different vendors. The speed at these sites is anywhere from 3Mbps (Satellite) up to 100+Mbps (Cable)
 Now to my question, I want to make sure our MPLS and Internet circuits (and AWS Direct Connect circuits) are scaled accordingly to support all of these downloads in this window. We want to make sure the downloads happen fairly quick (say less than say 10 minutes per device).
 Does anyone know of an online calulator that would help me do the math?
 I definitely plan on contacting our Telco to get their input, but I want to have some numbers (at least rough numbers) before engaging them to make sure they're not making shit up.
 As you can imagine this is a very large and very important implementation (we're on year 3 of the project) for my company and I want my portion (the network) to go as smoothly as possible.
 Any input would be muchly appreciated!

Apparently the sonicwall had DHCP configured for this interface but I didn’t catch that when configuring the new firewall. So the cutover happens and all appears to be working fine in the environment. Until today. The customer lost power last night and thats when the meraki router was no longer reachable. I spent an hour on the phone with the vendor who manages the meraki troubleshooting what could be the issue. I was out of ideas until they mentioned that they are configured for DHCP and that’s when I realized I never set up a DHCP sever for the interface (because when do routers use DHCP? Is this standard practice or something now?) Anyways, I configured a small address pool and the router came back online. I’m just surprised that the router maintained its lease from the previous firewall for as long as it did. At least I’m assuming that’s how it was still able to function. Anyone experience anything similar?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 New place I have started working at have a firewall with a less than optimal config. I am trying to get my head around it to make some improvements. They currently have a:
 Corporate Network (which I would like the VPN to be able to access) (10.*.*.*)
 VPN IP Range (172.1.*.*)
 Seperate Gateway VLAN (172.2.*.*) for servers they can access - these servers have an IP in both corporate and seperate VLAN, with gateway only entered on the seperate VLAN. This VLAN also has its own DNS which is what VPN clients are currently pointed to and provides the gateway VLAN ip address for these servers
 Issue is that people feel restricted, cant access file shares as if they were in work etc., have to remote on to an RDP server and productivity is suffering. My thoughts are that if the VPN is secure and has MFA in place, they can be considered secure enough to access all (or rather most - some is still locked behind other VLANs) corporate resources and work exactly as if they were in the office.
 So, to the issue - 
  
I have put a rule in place on the firewall to allow fully authenticated users access to the corporate VLAN.
 
I have updated the DNS on my computer to the corporate DNS. With this in place DNS works and I can ping ALL servers on the corporate VLAN except those with an IP address in both networks.
 
Pinging the other servers on their Gateway IP address works
 DNS gets the correct IP but I cant ping these on the corporate IP range.
 
 I suspect this is a routing and / or firewall issue but any pointers on where I should be looking would be greatly appreciated!

 VLAN 1 port 1 to 48.
 WEB-GUI access only port 25-48. Web access port 1-23 do not connect. 
 Although when I connect the router to port 1, only 1 - 23 are switching and connecting from/to internet
 Router to port 24, only 24-48 are switching and connecting from/to internet
 So it looks like 1-23 and 24-48 are somehow separated or not fully functional.
 Hardware, Software or Set-up Problem ?

 Do simple traffic generators suffice for network maintenance? Do protocol load tests need to be performed on a regular basis as well? Perhaps a portable version of Ixia or Spirent equipment is necessary? Or a simple VIAVI or EXFO traffic generator do the most necessary things?
 Let me ask in this way: Are network field technicians just using simple portable ethernet traffic generators (VIAVI, EXFO,...) in their routine or are they using advanced state-of-the-art test equipment (Ixia or Spirent) to diagnose problems, like scalability problems with L3VPN services?

 The problem is that this user has lots of emails that they should no longer have access to in their new position. Is there a way to transfer their mailbox to their old supervisor without making a whole new user/email? 
 Right now our solution is just to create a whole new user with a new email and give their old supervisor access to their mailbox. However that just feels clunky. Is there a more elegant one?
 What is the best practice for lateral moves like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm at a loss. We have installed a new HVAC system and each of the 4 pieces of equipment has an internal IP (statically configured - no DHCP). The HVAC vendor has specialized (and very expensive) software in his laptop that is needed in order to configure/troubleshoot/etc.
 The request is to provide him remote access to prevent the cost and travel time for him to come to the location. I am using an Ubiquiti UDM-Pro router and created a VPN. I can add desktops to this VPN (including his), but there is no way (that I know) to add those 4 pieces of equipment to this VPN network just by configuring their NICs.
 I considered creating a VLAN with or without its own public IP. That would add all the HVAC equipment on its own private subnet, but would run into the same issue on how to give his remote workstation access to this IP network? I can only think of a way to VPN the router itself given the limitations I have to change the equipment at hand.
 Hopefully I am missing something obvious. Tks in advance.

 I recently got a new job as an Automation Specialist but was laid off 3 months in due to budget. I've been looking for jobs for 1.5 months now, and still don't have one.
 As far as interviews go, I've gotten:
 15 1st interviews with HR/Recruiters
 5 2nd Interviews
 2 3rd+ Interviews
 My question is, is this normal? I know it's not a good time of year to find a job, and the layoffs nationally make competing for full remote jobs difficult. There's unfortunately not a lot going on in my city for jobs at the moment, especially with my limited experience. 
 I'm wondering if I should attribute this to 'hard time for jobs', or if I'm actually doing something wrong. I feel overqualified for Desktop Support jobs, but underqualified for System Engineer jobs.

 We are expanding our datacenter with another datacenter about 100m apart from our main DC.
 Our current network design is that our mainbuilding (DC-1) has a core firewall/router with dual ISPs and ROAS directly to access switches. It also has direct connection to our ICS-network firewalls (for temporary RDP-access from internet) which in turn also is Router on a stick down to the ICS access switches.
 So basically theres only a core layer and an access layer.
 The new building (DC-2) will have its own subnets and networks, but will need to be connected to DC-1 since the SCADA-server is there.
 THe buildings will have a lot of fibers between them. I was thinking of placing 2x L3 switches in each building (instead of core direct access to access layer) with redudant links to each core FW in DC-1. So basically sharing the core layer between the DCs, but a separate distribution layer in each building.
 I am by no means a network expert, but has some experience. Unfortunately i've been asked to fix something between the DCs. Appreaciate any tips!

I looked back on the older jobs I've had, and I keep getting into jobs where I am doing less and less of what is in my skillset, and in some cases less actual work, while getting paid more, as I get older and gain skills. 
 I miss the days when I was managing the virtual architecture, making and managing the VMs, architecting AD, DNS, DHCP, and WDS, doing the backups, checking everything out in the morning and doing things all day long. I miss the troubleshooting days of desktop support, where I had some mysterious problem and had to actually figure out what was going wrong and fix it, rather than just wipe machines and start them over. I actually miss the days when my workload took up most of my day, but I sure don't miss the crap pay I'd get for it. 
 Why do you suppose this is? Why is the pay for doing the most work so much lower than jobs where the workload is so much less? Has anyone else encountered this?

 I'm very comfortable in my job, and whilst the role is basic, the benefits are great.
 I am the only IT in the office of 150 users, and my manager is based in another country. So I report to no one in person. 
 I have my own office, with direct access to a roof terrace where I can enjoy fresh air, coffee and a view. My office has a fully catered kitchen, where we are provided fresh food and cooked meals daily. They pay for my medical insurance, gym membership and pension. The employees are great people that I get on with very well too. 
 But here's the hitch...
 I've been offered 25% increase on my salary by an oil company. This company, whilst paying considerably more, do not offer these little perks. No free food, no gym, no nice view, and my desk would be in the middle of the main office.
 They would also expect me to be able to assist outside of normal hours, and even on occasion, do jobs that would not normally fall under the scope of work for Helpdesk support.
 My conundrum is do I stay where I am, in a big, comfortable, established company with all of these benefits, or risk it all for 25% pay increase? 
 What would you do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Networking Community, 
 Looking for some of your opinions / recommendations for installing PhPIPAM in terms of hardware. I work for a large global enterprise who is largely currently using excel to track IP's. Long term strategy is to bring in a enterprise grade IPAM (Efficent IP, Infoblox, etc) but in the meantime (until we can get budget) we need to get some sort of sane way (not excel) to track IP's across a very large global org. Enter PhPIPAM. 
 I am working on getting a RHEL server built to install this on but for the life of me cannot find any sort of recommendations on hardware. I know it does not require much in terms of CPU/Mem but definitely do not want to undershoot it and have performance issues down the road. 
 Any opinions / suggestions? 
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, how do you all handle backups of object stores? From the viewpoint of an end user of object storage, not as a provider.
 For example, we host an application that uses object store as it's backend, and we would like to backup the files in the object store, preferably the backup should land in object store as well (using block storage for backup would defeat the cost advantages of using object store in the first place).
 One option I found was using rlcone to synchronize all the contents to a different object store, however this is slow, and does not easily provide files from X days ago.
 How do you handle this problem at your organization? Or is this a killer argument against using object store at all for you?
 Curious to hear, and thanks already :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have setup a mirrored storage space using 3x4TB HDDs and 1x8TB HDD totaling 4 HDDs. I will keep 4 SATA slots for the pool, 1 for the OS SSD and 1 extra as a temp slot, so would just like to ask a few question to confirm my understanding.
 Question 1:
 The useable pool size is 18.1 TB, so am I correct to assume 9TB would be usable?
 Is the 9 TB of data distributed across the 4 drives, so that there are always 2 copies?
 What I'm afraid of is that I do not have full redundancy across 9TB of data do to the uneven number of TBs relative to HDDs.
 Question 2:
 If I was to purchase a new 8TB drive can I easily removed a 4TB drive from the pool?
 So I would end up with 2x4TB and 2x8TB, pool size would be ~24TB with usable space ~12TB?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a LoB app that uses the %TEMP% location to save attachment content for emails. User clicks task in the app, a %TEMP%/123/45678.pdf is created (both 123 folder, and 45678.pdf). Once done the app seems to rename the contract_90123.pdf. effective permissions also show full access for this location.
 That rename appears to be intermittently failing, so the expected attachment isnt present and the email fails to generate. procmon shows 'path not found' on the rename operation.
 From the information i've gathered so far, it's an infrequent failure but when it happens appears to occur for a period of time. We appear to be fine for a week but last week we had it occur for all generated email attachments and was 100% reproducable.
 The infra is RDS2019 (6 servers) using UPD's, which runs on S2D storage. %TEMP% was not originally included in the UPD but as of an hour ago now included for testing. I doubt that will have any fix due. There's no apparent heavy resource usage or noticable performance issues when the issue occurs to suspect heavy load.
 We seem to have no other issues on the RDS's other than this rename operation failing. Running the app locally also has no problems. LoB support say it's an issue with our environment and with it only occuing on our RDS's, i'm inclined to beleive them.
 Any sugestions on what to do to further diagnose this one? due to the seeming isolated file, i'm out of ideas as anything i can come up with (eg: bad disk/ram/network) would affect far more than this.

 How do you 'manage' permission changes to folder structures in SharePoint Online?
 We currently ask that users create a ticket requesting access with a link to what they need - IT then get authorisation from manager.
 Or we ask authorised managers to request it for a user.
 This is so we have a log of permission changes, this log of request/authorisation needs to stay put of course, along with the auditable actions by IT.
 It's just of a PITA right? We get loads of requests per day, wondering how other organisations make these changes as they scale and grow as an organisation?
 Just to add, I am looking at implementing PIM/Identify Governance using security groups as a way to combat it, anyone use this for SharePoint permissions? Advice on its implementation? Best ways to allow users to know which groups are for which folders?

 My favourite example of this was a few years ago at a small office where filesharing was dealt with by a Dell Poweredge server, and wifi was dealt with using a few cheap APs. One day the server's PSU fell over, and while one on-site tech was fixing it the office manager/company director asked "has the server failed because there's too much WiFi?". It took every fibre of my being to respond "no, that's not how it works" with a straight face
 Another was a chap who couldn't log in to one of our AzureAD workstations. His hypothesis? "I'm logged in to my laptop at my desk so the system obviously won't let me log in to two systems at once". The actual reason was he'd got his account password wrong...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We chatted back and forth for 30 minutes, the dude was pretty chill and he asked me basics about me (where am i from, my academic degrees, told him about myself)...
 He asked me simple questions after that, such as the definition of DNS, kernel, OSI model... I answered most of it but he told me that i still need to give it a revision, and go for a technical test in a couple of days. 
 The test will consist on a google form with questions related to my position, so it's all about collecting information here and there i guess..
 If i pass that test, i will jump to the technical interview which is probably the hardest part of the whole process. I'm not sure if i can make it since i barely got any experience or knowledge in cloud computing overall. I'm also not sure about what are they looking for exactly since you jump to their formation program even if u nail all the interviews, i'm not sure if i can make it to that point just with a few days of studying basic stuff.
 What would you guys suggest me?

 Sometimes the icon image also changes to the 'This PC' icon image but when right clicking you can still see it is registered to the origianl application.
 Tried all the usual icon cache related fixes but can't work out the fault or even what causes the taskbar icons to corrupt in the first place.

It should come as an some kind an agent type and should have a possibility to be installed in Linux VMs.
 All the traceroute results should be able to be seen in some kind of one centralized location
  
Maybe someone could recommend tool for that ? It could commercial or free. Till now I've been using the product called Pingplotter - it allows you to install remote agents in your DC and see the results in centralized location. But that remote agent traceroute capability is quite legacy one and not supported anymore - so there're bugs which is annoying. Also - they have a new product called Pingplotter Cloud - that should do the job - but the pricing model is different, will gonna try the trial version. Also - i would like to get some input from you - if there're other tools for that job. Thanks !!

 Two systems with identical group policy settings.
 Event log behaviour is differenct between Windows 10 and Windows 11
 The setting is question is Event Viewer > Windows Logs > Security > right-click > Properties
 Windows 10 defaults to "Overwrite events as needed"
 Windows 11 defaults to "Do not overwrite events"
 This is a problem because when security event log fills up, system won't accept non-administrative logons.
 Running gpresult /h , the only event log settings I can see are
 Settings/Policies/Windows Settings/Security Settings/Event Log
 and there's nothing relevant here: both are set to 'retain by days' and 'retain for 30 days'.
 Does any one have any ideas?
 Thanks!

 can i get windows users & passwords in a text file?
  
I'm a junior dev at a small startup, so I'm doing a lot of stuff I know basically nothing about. We got these small servers called zima boards, and I think they're supposed to be endpoints to kiosks and stuff, maybe get sensor data or shit like that idk they just threw me a box, rattled on about some bullshit I didn't understand(I heard mqtt so it's probably gonna be stuff like that) and said "have fun". I know they said "we need to get windows on it because the users and passwords would be a burden to change" or something like that, and I heard a conversation which mentioned that we're gonna be doing like 50 of these at a time, so I'm guessing my task is to figure out how to install windows on these without having to interact with each one first.
 My second question to anyone who knows windows, is it possible to get the users & passwords in a text file? That would mean we wouldn't have to install windows to begin with, and since it comes with a debian based distro we can just bash some bullshit together to create the users.
 oooh wait, is it possible to run a script with grub(somehow, haven't done it before) to get it to boot there? If so, then I could just run a script to install grub(if not installed), reboot, then run a script which selects the device(maybe? idk all the commands to do that but it seems reasonable right?)

 Similarly, the Apache plugin outputs a URL "http://abc.def/:80" with the port, suggesting that's where the server instance is hosting a web-page. But does it only query the web-page and pull the Apache version that way or is there more going on under the hood?
 I'm not able to find any .nasl script files for these plugins either, so if you could point me to a resource where these exist, that'd help too.

 I've tried normal SDR apps, but you can usually only see about 20MHz at a time, because it's trying to capture the signal at real-time, which isn't needed for diagnosing Wi-Fi.
 Someone's gotta have done this already, right?!

No improvements unfortunately. OS in most cases is Windows 11 however the problem started around a week or two ago.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all!
 I have been reading a lot about PKI and moreover Active Directory Certification Services.
 I have some questions:
 - What is the difference between OCSP and CDP? What is the best scenario to have one or the other?
 - Does OCSP respond if the current client certificate is valid? Is this statement valid for regular CRL CDP as well? How do clients knows to check the ocsp? Is it embedded on the certificate as an AIA point?
 - I have noticed that when setting up the AIA you always point it to the root CA certificate, why is that? Regular CDP point to .crl files but not AIA.
 - If I don't set up a custom IIS server with CRL, do clients pull it from default points such as LDAP? is IIS custom CDP best practice for DMZ external clients where LDAP is not accessible? why CRLs cannot be accessed through HTTPS?
 - What is the objective of using multiple SANs in a certificate?
 - What are the considerations when migrating CAs to other servers? Does it work by backing up old CA, turn off the server CA, create the new one, install role, restore CA registry backup but manitaining IP and server name? Would that keep the default CDP and AIA settings as well as matching DNS zone records. What about the IIS servers hosting enrollment and CDPs if any? What about the NDES role if it is present?
 - Can I change renewal key lenght on capolicy.inf if certificates are required to increase key length? Is there another way to do it? What tasks are needed to be done after that?
 - What is Certificate Transparency what are CT logs? How does ADCS implements it?
 What is a CAA NS record, and how does Microsoft implements it in DNS or ADCS?
 I'd be thanking anyone who can help on answerings these questions as I am really curious about the topic.

 To image the devices we usually boot to an "active disk image" USB and plug our external hard drive that contains the image.
 The issue we have is that we cannot select the internal SSD as the destination disk, although this has worked on previous Dell computers. The first thought it that it would be related to secure boot but i have had no success after turning this off.
 If anyone could point me in the right direction that would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am building a file downloader using c# httpclient which downloads files from an asp.net IIS server. My test is downloading 46GB of data spread out over about 40k files, done by about 4k instances of the downloader process (this is done in a build system, so each instance of the downloader is run/cached separately,). This works out to an average of 10 files downloaded per httpclient instance and an.average of 1MB per file.
 Everything works fine until minute 4, when suddenly my download speed goes to 0. I have a timeout of 1 minute on the process and 5 attempts are made to download each file. About 2 minutes after the stalled downloads, it starts back up again. This is after the first two attempts timed out. The server logs show that it didn't even seem to receive the request that was being asked of it, and when it did receive a request, the server claims it handled it quickly.
 So far to troubleshoote I have tried to increase the dynamic port range, and limit the number of requests being sent at once to 75. Still this happens pretty deterministically around the 3-5 minute mark.
 Is there something I can check and try to figure out why it is stalling? I know Wireshark can be a useful tool, but I don't really know what I am looking for in this case. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I run a small WISP and am moving to Mikriotik HAP line for user routers. I have a big goal to eventually set up a mechanism to redirect past due clients to a "Hey, pay your bill" web page.
 Originally, I was trying to make this a function of DHCP with classes for user MACs that are active or suspended. Active clients will be given an IP on a subnet that is allowed out via NAT permit policy, wheras suspended MACs would be placed on a subnet not allowed out to the internet and has all DNS queries pointing to the IP of my web server (via bind9 views one using normal DNS forwarding and the other pointing to a local dnsmasq instance) with rewrite rules to my "pay your bill" page.
 This ALMOST worked, but when you have multiple IPs on one VLAN, one IP must be the primary IP and that put a halt to anything working. This was because the relay agent will always use the primary IP for the relay agent IP to determine which pool to grant an IP from. I can get a device from active to suspended if the suspended IP is the default, but it will not go back since the relay agent IP will always be the primary IP on the VLAN.
 This led me to consider RADIUS, since you can use Framed-IP-Address to reassign an IP.
 I have a working baseline FreeRADIUS server set up that accepts usernames, passwords and secrets and correctly responds. It is backed by MySQL. I can figure out mac-auth and the rest but I need to know how to make the HAPs authenticate themselves once they get on the network.
 The imagined flow would be DHCP on the primary (suspended) subnet. Radius processes if the MAC is active or not. If it is not it will stay on the suspended subnet. If the MAC is active RADIUS will provide an IP on the secondary (active) subnet.
 Is there a way to make what I am aiming for work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Haven’t worked directly with AD directly for a while, so these are probably newbie questions.
 If I have a single DC on 2012 OS, with 2008 r2 functional level forest/domain, and I’d like to add a secondary DC (to replace one that recently failed), I don’t see a place in the instruction steps where he functional level is specified when adding the second DC. I’m assuming that this is bc the second dc will just replicate off the first one, but is this a safe assumption? 
 I’ve learned not to assume much when working with MS, so I looked for docs online that specified whether this is fine going from, say, the current OS-functional level combo to, say, 2016 OS with the same 2008 r2 functional level, but I can’t seem to find it. At some point with the newer os’s, won’t I encounter one(like 2019, 2022?) that won’t recognize or allow the new server to become a secondary dc to the existing primary one running such an old functional level? TIA!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I got some reports one our our remote networks has been running a little slow. 
 I ran a packet monitor on the locations SonicWall and saw an insane amount of ARP requests, all coming from the same MAC which I've identified as the Modem for that location. The ARP requests are NOT for our network, so the SonicWall is dropping them. All of the ARP requests are sourced and destined for IP's in our ISP's range (WOW). In about 30 seconds we'll drop a little over 5000 ARP packets. I was originally investigating an OSPF issue when I found this. Could this be a routing issue on our part, or does this seem like the ISP is at fault? I've called them twice now and its been very unhelpful. 
 Thanks in advance. I appreciate any help.

Now i am only allowed to use Microsoft software and WSUS. Branch offices are receiving updates directly from MS via reg key. I guess the task scheduler is not save to use because of several viruses. Do you have a powershell script which restarts and reports like the software patchbatch? Restart via csv file an remotePowershell is easy. But logging and uninstall and mail reports when everything worked or not will be hard. There are also some cmdlets with useful functions, but i am not sure which one is trustful and how to deploy on all servers.

I know there are various tools, but somehow this is not really effective so far. I sometimes find it difficult to focus and "forget" something that I only remember some time later. The goal is better time management. It works so far rather semi well. Information/tasks come via various channels and I would like to manage this for myself in one tool(best cross platform). 
 Tried Task,ToDo,OneNote,Google Keep…. but hasn't really worked for me so far.
 Now the question to you, what and how do you use tools to organize your daily work and projects and not lose focus?
 Thank you all and have a nice Sunday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[That's my job, literally my entire job. 
 Just spent 13 hrs yesterday trying to migrate never patched VMs from 2013 and get them to boot up on Azure. Not just that the client wants their disks to be BitLocker encrypted, that was 6 hrs of screen-sharing & logs sharing with the Critical Situation support team from Azure. 
 All this in a fixed time-frame, if a VM doesn't migrate - it has direct monetary impact on the project. Which leads to every hour updates, extreme levels of micro-management; hell the only time I got up was to piss, 3 times in 13 hrs. 
 My team is made up of 4 recent graduates(almost good for nothing at the moment), 1 team lead who disappears when he is needed, 2 engineers who can't write a single line of powershell if their life depended on it. And then there's me, I have written SOPs for every single action that needs to be performed, have automated over 120 minutes worth of manual configurations; I lead the migration, fix other's mistakes, deal with app owners and their bs expectations. I deal with the curt/narcissitic MDs of my company, while my manager makes sure everything "looks good", because things need not be good, they just gotta look good.
 tldr; V2V/server rehosting is stupid, do not do it. Just build a new VM and install your shit on it.

 I recently read in an article, that ISPs could determine if the user uses tethering, so if the packet originated from a PC/Laptop rather than from the phone itself because the phone would use a different TTL than the connected device.
 Is this true? Would my phone use a different TTL for its packets than my Linux/MacOS/Windows device? Respectively is the TTL dependent of the used OS?
 Or did the website mean, that my phone would represent another hop in the network so that the packets would have a lower TTL? (Couldn't it just be that the packet went randomly another hop?)

 Your software should support 465 and optionally 587 – implicit TLS via submissions over port 465 is where we're moving to, according to RFC 8314 from 2018.
 Dunno about everyone else, but I was definitely under the impression that STARTTLS on 587 was the widely deployed "better" option. Seems like it's just widely deployed where implicit TLS should be.
 Happy SNI sounds, because multiplexing SMTP traffic sucks otherwise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Friends,
 I work for an IT company and have 15 years of experience in Telecom domain. I worked on various Network Inventory design and Audit projects which were not much technical in nature. The network inventory design involved the various vendors SDH/SONET transport devices, Cisco and Nokia switches and routers.
 I don't have any hands on experience configuring the routers and switches in the live network.
 In my current project, I am responsible to setup E2E test environment (Integration of applications) and physically connect the various DOCSIS cable modems and gateways and fiber ONTs devices in the test lab and auto provision them in ICOMS and backend systems.
 I am doing good in this project and my efforts are highly appreciated by the client managers.
 But then I really don't know what to do next to progress in my career. 
 Recently, I cleared AWS solution architect associate exam.
 I am planning to upskill myself in following areas and would need some geniune advice on what should I do next.
 I have a weakness of not being consistent with my studies or certifications. Back of the mind, I think what is the use of doing certifications if there is no real practical experience and companies prefer to appoint those who have solid hands on experience.
 Please suggest
  
AWS Cloud Security
 Ansible Network Automation
 DevOps
 Dockers, Kubernetes
  
Thank you

 - Bridge domain (What is the difference between VLAN, SVI and bridge domain)
 - EPG : Is there any equivalent term or concept in a standalone cisco switch?
 - L3Out and Interface Profile: L3Out I understand is when you want a leaf in the fabric to establish L3 adjacency to external router, this seems bit easy to grasp but what exactly is Interface Profile again?

 Been in end-user support as a field technician for about 2 years and spoke to my boss about wanting to transition into system admin/active directory and go on the cybersec pathway for climbing up. Company owner agreed to reserve the next trainee position for me and we'll be meeting up next week to be discussing the terms of the position etc.
 For some background, recently I asked the company owner for a letter of good faith to be released to one of our contractees as a employee in an attempt to move upwards, however was turned down for lack of experience, which is where he offered me training and a junior system admin position. He's been very accommodating with me so far and even gave me a raise recently. 
 If anyone could give me their 2 cents and some insight into what I should expect as a junior system admin going from end-user support. that would be cool.

 I'm trying to consolidate consoles a little, at least bring as much as I can into one place. Ideal would be an agentless network monitor which could drill down and crucially allow a jump off into RDP or similar onto an endpoint... whilst processing logging, potentially a light SIEM capability, amd asset management. And a laser beam to scratch my bum from space.
 Closest I've found is Auvik, possibly ManageEngine. Solarwinds ticks most boxes as a solution.. but...well. Not sure I'm ready to forgive on that one...
 Any suggestions and experiences gratefully received.

 When these programs were on-prem, they had very simple passwords as access was only permitted via VPN or no-prem network. When they were moved to cloud, there was no care or concern to change them.
 I have reported these security issues to our IT management and no action was taken.
 FYI, username was simple like admin or administrator and the password was shown on the same page or the default that the vendor has for their clients. Also, these platforms give full admin access and full view of all information, statistics, user privileges, clients etc.
 These cloud platforms run the core functions of our organization and are used by every department (no 2fa, with no password policies, no restrictions and are globally available via subdomain).
 Additionally, our InfoSec team has been aware and have let management know, but no action either. Also when these platforms were migrated, InfoSec was not involved in any step too.
 What do I do (or not do)?

 We have a few thousand mailboxes on Rackspace Email and less than one hundred on Hosted Exchange on the same domain. Rackspace’s temp fix requires us to migrate everyone to M365, but I’m wondering if I could(should?) spin up a new domain for the impacted Exchange mailboxes only.
 They’d be fresh mailboxes, but it might buy us the time needed to recover from the attack. Migrating a few thousand healthy mailboxes seems like a bad idea just to save less than one hundred.
 I’m not taking any action until I’m able to speak with them. Left a callback request with support, but no response yet.

 What makes up of your security zones? Do all traffic pass through your firewall? Do you do l3 segmentation with vrfs and sandwich the firewall?
 We currently have a ROAS design with subinterfaces to 2x l3 switches, which in turn have dot1q trunk links to the access switches.
 Since we're increasing in hosts I was wondering if maybe we should decrease the traffic going through the fw by instead do intervlan routing and route only specific vrfs to firewall. I heard this is a popular design.
 Would be nice to see some examples of how a design would be.

 Here is our dilemma - 
 We have Cisco FPR 2140s (4 of them, 2 HA pairs, 1 pair at each data center). We are currently trying to setup ECMP but we found out that SSL cannot be enabled on interfaces that you want to participate in EMCP. Fine, we are in the process of converting them to IPsec but the implementation of IPsec RA VPN to a Cisco firepower sucks honestly. It seems it was an after thought as there has to be a local XML on every endpoint in order for the first connection to be made (after the first connection, the endpoint pulls the XML from the firewall)
 We don't think we can do this because of the mobile IoT devices that our company VPNs with. We also have some site to sites that are causing us to make VTIs and our company just keeps growing it seems and the firewalls are getting more complex with that. (sorry for the rant)
 QUESTION - We are looking into getting 2 separate firewalls (1 at each data center) to handle RA VPN, site to sites and any other odds and ends. We have public IP addressing to accomplish this but I am wondering if anyone else does something similar? Breaks portions of config onto different devices just to make it more simple rather than trying to do everyone on one firewall

 And then I made a oneshot service in /lib/systemd/system/hello.service, which takes a command hello foo bar, and sends it to the socket mentioned above.
 Is this the correct way to go about implementing the client side aka the oneshot hello.service or am I doing something wrong? And is there a better way?
 The reason why I chose this is because it allows me to then call the script simply by hello command.
 For the server:
 [Unit] AssertPathExists=/usr/bin/hellod [Service] ExecStart=/usr/bin/hellod Restart=always PrivateTmp=false NoNewPrivileges=false [Install] WantedBy=default.target 
 And for the client:
 [Unit] Requires=hellod.service After=hellod.service AssertPathExists=/usr/bin/hello [Service] Type=oneshot ExecStart=/usr/bin/hello --init RemainAfterExit=true PrivateTmp=false NoNewPrivileges=false [Install] Alias=hello WantedBy=default.target 
 Also is /usr/bin/ the correct location to store the hello and hellod scripts?
 And whats the correct location to store user configurable files, maybe /etc/hello?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can I get some advice and opinions please.
 I began a quick format on a 60TB SAN storage partition connected over iSCSI around 6 hours ago on Server 2019.
 The aim is to start fresh for backup storage due to capacity issues.
 Disk Manager just says "formatting" with no percentage or any other indication of what is happening here.
 Was this approach the wrong way to do this?
 Should the operation to prepare the drive have been done via the SAN management application?
 Wondering if this will ever finish.....Should I cancel the format operation and just delete the existing data in there?
 Is cancelling at this point risky? The data is not important but I need the storage to be reliable and ready to be reused 
 Is there any way of telling if progress is being made? The only indicator I can think of for now is to go to Resource Manager and I can see the drive activity is maxed and running so at least I know its not hung. 
 Any estimates on how long it may take to complete?
 *** EDIT ***
 OK answer here became obvious..... Rebooted Server. Deleting, recreating partition with a quick format then worked within 5 mins. 
 Lesson I'm taking out of this is to preemptively reboot before starting anything that could suck up time and cause worry and frustration.
 Thanks again for the help all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently came into possession of a UPS that was decommissioned from an old server rack at my friend's office. They were throwing it out so I gladly took it off their hands. Unfortunately, I didn't know it was a 240v UPS. My homelab is entirely running on 120v and I don't have any 240v outlets in the server room.
 The server rack is currently on a circuit which has very low load (aside from the rack itself). I see 3 options here, which are below:
  
Purchase a step-up transformer to plug into the 120v outlet, to give the UPS 240v output
 Use two different out-of-phase outlets on different circuits and wire them to a single 240v plug
 Pay an electrician to run a new circuit dedicated for the UPS
  
Obviously Option 3 is the most ideal option, but running a new circuit will be somewhat difficult and expensive due to the layout of my house. Option 2 sounds sketchy as hell, but should theoretically work (I have two different circuits in the server room). Option 1 sounds easy, but I am worried about dirty power or low amperage.
 What do you guys think?

 I've been recently handed such a project and have been reading up on it and trying to find suitable solutions or software components to implement it. If anyone has any experience in the subject I'd like to hear it.
 I know of irods, which is a data management system but doesn't handle the storage itself.
 Tape based is a requirement, so is an open format(ltfs, otf etc) for long term compatibility. Some form of cataloging is also required. And automated ingestion is a plus.
 So far I've come up with irods+cea phobos. Or spectrum archive library edition + mergerfs and irods.
 Edit: I also know of fujifilm object archive. But it's a paid solution.
 Edit 2: cloud is not an option, should've probably included that from the beginning.

That means separate appliances for separate groups that provide a clean separation of responsibility. 
 The market has been flooded with SD-WAN products and the marketing is starting to become all a blur. 
 Just wondering who here has bought into a vendor's SD-WAN story and how are they liking it?

The real nail in the coffin was Rackspace's absolutely dreadful "support". So far everything is working great. As of a few weeks ago our Rackspace account is fully deactivated.
 Here are the steps I recommend for other small companies that are cost-conscious:
 1) Through Rackspace's Office 365 page, buy Rackspace-managed Office 365 licenses for all the users. These show up in 365 Admin as "Reseller" licenses, as opposed to licenses purchased directly from Microsoft which show up as "Commercial direct".

 Btw in my scenario 2FA will be protecting access to a network's server as well as applications. Thanks

 The process itself, using the rendom utility seems straightforward and is well documented online.
 There are, of course, caveats and unsupported scenarios i.e Exchange on premise.
 It is obviously a major change to the core structure of a network as you are changing AD name, Dns, renaming Dcs, Group Policy, and Pcs.
 My question is ... have you ever done this in a production environment and, most importantly, how did it go?
 Was it smooth sailing?
 Were there unexpected consequences or issues post rename?

 ​
 To set up the scenario: I am 40+, working 20+ years in IT and do something IT management and network engineering related nowadays. Started off somewhere around the Y2k problem with floppy disks in my hand ;)
 ​
 Yesterday a somewhat recently retired neighbour of mine approached me via WhatsApp if I could come upstairs in the evening to help with "an IT problem related to hard disks". This was the first time in the last 12 years we live here.
 ​
 I texted back that I am sorry but I do not do any IT support outside my family, because the small issues could easily escalate in terms of time and knowledge invested and that this was abused in the past. Got no answer.
 ​
 Today I met him outside the house and was getting blasted with how angry he is and how I lack a sense of community and how "all IT people" tell him the same (ah?) and that we all need help (what?). And that his question would be something about his TV and that is HDD is now empty/blank.
 ​
 To top it off, he yelled at me in front of my kids while we were on our way to get a Christmas tree.
 ​
 Really?
 ​
 Am I supposed to get 'ready for work' on a Friday evening after an exhausting week to peek into something which is both outside my expertise (datacentre != TV) nor interest?
 ​
 Why is it that non-IT people seem to take it as totally granted that you fix any consumer product because "you work in IT".
 ​
 I am totally sick of it. Am I the asshole or do I have one as neighbour?
 ​
 Any advise, pat on the back or other form of moral support is appreciated :]

General infra like VMware, storage, sysadmin etc. I have moved to use the cloud in the last 7 years as well. I have (finally) been promoted and now find myself Head of Infrastructure. It's a lofty title for what I actually do but it's good. I have two teams I supervise, an infra team of more classic sysadmins, and a DevOps team which is developers who are interested and work in infra stuff. My role is extremely hands-on around 50% still doing infrastructure engineering but I am gaining more staff so that will continue to reduce with time.
 I am planning for the future and looking at similar roles to see what I need to be aiming for. What I am interested in right now is what sort of interview questions should I expect for these sorts of roles. Since I didn't interview for my Head of role I've never had a management interview. 
 What are the general questions I should expect, is there any changes to my interview style over engineering roles I need to anticipate? (I found being extremely relaxed and personable worked very well, but I understand cultural differences here come into play as London and Stockholm, where I have worked, are very relaxed environments for engineering roles where that might not be the case where you are from). Any other general advice anybody might have?

 I would love to only use authenticator, unfortunately we cannot force them to use their personal device for it. 
 Does anyone have insight into this or workarounds?
 Thanks!

 But is it just me, or is it unnecessarily cumbersome for both the user and the administrator? I kind of get the administrator part, that's to be expected. But launching a completely different window seems like it's really going to get on users' nerves and be a hard sell to decision makers. Especially when the decision makers/contributors themselves are the ones that have to be on external sites regularly.
 It would be nice if the Application Guard instance opened in a new tab rather than a whole new window similar to the IE mode.
 How do others manage Application Guard?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello.
 I'm planning on making some changes on a network, because we are short on ports.
 I have 2x Layer 3 core switches as cluster.
 There is very little inter-vlan routing on it.
 ​
 However, I have a lot of servers that are connected with SFP modules.
 To avoid having to additionally buy 2x very expensive layer 3 core switches, I would like to buy 2x layer 2 switches with 24 SFP ports for the servers.
 I would then connect them redundantly to the core switches as distribution layer.
 ​
 At least that was my idea.
 However, I can't find any Layer 2 switches with more than 4 SFP ports at all.
 Do such devices even exist, and if not, why?

 We've had probably 30+ accesses switches with multimode fiber running without issues for longer than I've been here. No errors or oddities I've seen on the connections. 
 To test this, I did hook up a switch using single mode optics/fiber and sure enough it connected. No errors on the port etc.
 Does anyone know the technical reason this works? I would assume there would be bigger issues due to the diameter size of the cabling differences?

 I have been beating my head on the wall trying to fix this weird issue: when I move computers to a different OU (with different Policy), the computers would still obeying the old policy that was applied to them in the former group.
 For example, I was having a container where computers are locked out after 30 minutes of inactivity and another container where computers are locked out after 8 hours.
 I moved a few computers from the 30 mins group to the 8 hours group.
 I ran gpresult /r on said computers and the results showing the new policy was successfully applied (8 hours). Local group policy showing that they are supposed to be logged out by 8 hours. But lo and behold, the naughty computers still locked themselves out after 30 minutes.
 So far I have tried many fixes, including 
 - Clear group policy catches
 - Took them off the domain, force policy update there, and put them back on.
 - anything else I could think of.
 ​
 Have you ever run into this issue? Please enlighten me! (I am a new system admin and inherited this weird ass system that needs a lot of reorganizing).
 ​
 Thank you so much!

 We are getting 1000 Mb/s cable internet dropped to a pole on the property and it will be my responsibility to bring it into the building and get it to the network cabinet.
 There is an existing 3/4 underground conduit that I will be using which might limit me to RG6 rather than RG11.
 The run will be around 150' of underground conduit and then 150' of running inside the building to the network cabinet.
 Will 300' of coax cable potentially give me loss issues? Am I overthinking this, can I just grab a 300' roll of RG6 copper clad steel cable from Home Depot and send it? 
 I also have the option of putting the cable modem in the building right where the coax enters and then go with 150' cat6 back to the cabinet but I'd like to avoid this option as I would much rather keep the modem with all the other network stuff.
 Any advice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I live in sweden and we have "city networks" which are owners of the fibre network municipaly and the middle man between customer and ISPs
 The city network in my are assigns a Vlan per customer which easily adds up to over 4096. They do this so the can authenticate every users traffic to a RADIUS server which returns what ISP that customer has a contract with ( which also allows us to choose between many diffrent ISPs). 
 What i was wondering is what they use to make sure they have enough Vlans. Double/tripple tagging or Q-in-Q? If so which would be more efficent for a network running up to 200 000 Vlans? 
 Wouldn't a tagging method use up a lot of processing power to tag/untag
 Does anyone have experience with these kinds of network structures?

 We’ve all been there before - the wording from a third party when something is fubar. The lack of updates, and in this case phrasing straight out of the offshore 1st line support playbook. This issue is at 12 hours odd now, to still be in the investigation stage says they know what’s wrong, it’s big, they don’t have a fix, or, they have no clue, which 12 hours in is a worry. 
 At this point, if you have users in rack space hosted email, I’d be looking at standing up a new solution to give functionality from now, and worry about historic data later - I fear this may not be a quick fix, or even something with a full fix. 
 I can’t think of anything that would create a 12 hour outage of exchange/hosted exchange that’s still in investigation (figuring out wtf is wrong) beyond something that is known, and the investigation is how the fuck do we unfuck this!
 Be prepared for the worst, hope for the best!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on a design proposal to connect multiple customer's networks to AWS using IPSEC S2S VPNs. This is straightforward for the most part. Establish VPN tunnels between AWS and the router. I am wondering if an alternative design might work where we configure a device (such as a Juniper SRX320 -- but open to other device suggestions) and ship it out to the customer with instructions to plug cable A into a network with internet access (such as a guest network) and cable B into the target network. Can the device behave as a standard client on the B interface (including receiving a DHCP address) but still allow AWS traffic to access devices on the network without being the default gateway for that network? The reason for this approach is it would simplify establishing VPN connections for customers as they would simply have to plug a device in instead of adding VPN configuration to their router.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking at various UEMs to help us manage our Windows workforce, much of which is remote (working from home), off the corporate network. Today we use PDQ Deploy + Inventory and love it, but it's limited to on-net management. PDQ Connect is coming and looks like it's going in a good direction, but I've got almost 1,000 PC's to a manage now, so I'm open to alternatives - and the solution that keeps coming up is Microsoft Intune. 
 We would like an application deployment solution that is flexible but will also let us run Powershell scripts, create groups and reports, and ideally provide a way to access the remote computer over the internet. Bonus if it works for Mac as well as Windows (though we are 99% Windows). One of the things I've seen with Intune that I really like is the ability to create PC profiles and once a user logs in to Azure AD, Intune (or Autopilot?) automatically deploys a profile to the computer. That seems powerful. 
 Other thoughts on Intune as a potential alternative (or accompaniment?) to PDQ?

My first thought is to do this at the network's firewall but ran into two issues. Our firewall is managed by our ISP, so it could take a while to implement, and I'm not quite sure how to target the single machine that's on DHCP, by MAC address maybe?
 Anyways.
 My current solution is to modify the hosts file and dump each web browsers cache. I have a PowerShell script for the hosts entries because YouTube has quite a few, and then I manually dump the browser caches. Any ideas how the user could get around this (beyond the obvious, user can edit the hosts file themselves because everybody here still has local admin, against my recommendations), or is there a better way?
 $baseEntry = "`n127.0.0.1`t" $ytDomains = @() # string array of domains I found here: https://www.netify.ai/resources/applications/youtube # cant list them, as previous post was removed because some are url shorteners foreach ($site in $ytDomains){ Add-Content -Path $env:windir\System32\drivers\etc\hosts -Value "$($baseEntry)$($site) www.$($site)" -Force } ipconfig /flushdns nbtstat -R

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I don't know if this is the correct sub for this, but maybe.
 my business has become the target of someone who is repeatedly autodialing our primary reception phone number. we block the number that's coming up as call ID, but then the attacker changes the number and starts again. Our phone provider (a voip pbx provider using voip.ms as their trunk) says they are not able to identify the original number but have confirmed the numbers are spoofed. The attacker calls periodically and berates the receptionist looking for some information that we don't have, and has told her they will jam up our switchboards until we give them the information. This has been going on for about 3 weeks. The caller has said they are in south africa, though the numbers they call from are 10 digit north american numbers. My receptionist took it on herself to give the attacker some fake information that she thought might satiate them, but it was quickly identified as false and seemed to enrage them further.
 I discussed this with the RCMP (canadian police force) and they were able to call to one of the numbers that the attacker had called from and speak to them and told them to stop. However that was about as effective as you'd expect. The RCMP said there was nothing additional that they could do and to contact the anti-fraud division (which I'm going to be doing today with limited expectations for success)
 So, given that I am not able to block the calls as the call ID keep changing and my phone provider isn't able to identify the actual source of the calls in order to provide to law enforcement, what options remain?

 And for the last two years I've been actively recruited for a Senior Network/Systems Engineer position with a tech firm who has high margins and a small number of employees. I'll be next in line to the CTO- with a clear path to his position.
 The nature of this company is that they do not really have much other than technical employees- and I'm running the show.
 It's also a very good paying gig.
 And while this is the best move for me there's an emotional component I've not not really felt before.
 There's no red flags or misgivings... but a lot of sadness. I more or less rescued the company from technical oblivion and built out fault tolerant systems which have really paid off.
 I'm going to miss my day today at this company. The people I can still have a relationships with.
 It was hard to see real sadness in the CEOs eyes when I gave him notice.
 Then there's the excitement of the new position. Lots of perks. Underground parking. Working with a strong competent team. 
 And yet- even though I am leaving my current position for all the right reasons.. I still feel sad.
 It's a big change.... and off we go.

 I am a SysAdmin* for a services company that has a workforce that changes frequently as it is contract based. We can go from 150 workers to 600+ in a matter of hours. As such, we are primarily in the "cloud" using virtualization services.
 Nonetheless, we still have a a physical HQ and a handful of full-time employees that require hardware. We are about to dump our MS and will be facing a situation wherein we will not have a means of safely/reliably obtaining the limited amount of hardware we occasionally need. We have tried Amazon with mixed to terrible results (and, honestly, we would be loathe to reveal this during an ISO audit) and companies like CDW are too rich for our blood, and companies like DELL and HP are not all that interested in entering into a lease program as we are very small potatoes. 
 So, do any of y'all have suggestions? It is important the source is reliable and on the up and up as we are ISO compliant and would like to keep it that way.
 Thank you!

 What we want to happen is if a user enters http://{domain}.com/, https://{domain}.com/ or http://www.{domain}.com/ we want it to redirect the user to https://www.{domain}.com/.
 Currently if a user enters http://{domain}.com/ it redirects to https://{domain}.com/ and if a user enters http://{domain}.com/ it redirects to https://www.{domain}.com/
 How can we get all 3 of the other domains to redirect to the https://www version of the site?

 Regarding VMs. Is the behavior the same? Does memory truly reset?
 I have a data archive on a proprietary time series database that is telling me it needs help. I cycled the server yesterday morning and it is still complaining. My gut tells me there is a flag on the file somewhere that I need to reset. I'm looking for it. Can't find a KB on it though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So i'm at a loss as to what to do about a fingerprint issue we're experiencing. We've previously enabled Windows Hello for Business and everything has been working great for probably a year now. 
 Now, all of a sudden the fingerprint readers are being super weird. They will work right after a reboot just fine, but after some time goes by when you next go to login it just doesn't act like you've touched the fingerprint reader at all. However, after unlocking with the password and then immediately locking the pc again it works perfectly! But if some time goes by... same non responsive issue. It does not give any failure messages.. just acts like it hasn't been touched.
 I have disabled usb selective suspend, disabled the pc from turning the device off to save power within device manager. Uninstalled antivirus, fully went through windows updates, updated all gpo policies with the newest templates and double checked them to make sure nothing changed. I've also made sure domain controllers were up to date on updates.
 Does anyone have any idea what could be causing this? It seems to be domain wide as it's not just one pc and it's the exact same symptoms on everyone of them.

We do have scavenging enabled for the default of 7 days for the No-Refresh Interval and the Refresh Interval. I'm assuming this is what's removing them. My understanding from Microsoft is that "Windows computers that are statically configured for TCP/IP try to dynamically register host address (A) and pointer (PTR) resource records." And, "Windows registers A and PTR resource records every 24 hours regardless of the computer's role." So if these servers are supposed to register every 24 hours, I don' understand why they're being scavenged. Are there specific logs that can help me troubleshooting this? I've looked through event viewer but didn't find anything helpful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So for a long time people were grousing that there's some slowness on the network, but we really could not pinpoint the exact cause of it.
 Last week the financial department complained that their financial program keeps on bombing out. So I decided to step in this week and try to find the cause of this issue for once and for all.
 Everything networking at their workstations was replaced. Flyleads was tested prior to being installed, and yet the problem persisted.
 A couple of tests later, and everything pointed to either a network cable fault issue or something on the core switch.
 Today we got in the "expert". He followed my test steps, and agreed that there is something funky going on, it either is the cabling or the core switch.
 So off to the server room we toddled, and do a few more tests on the switch. Same results.
 So we decided to reboot the switch by pulling power and bring it back on. He wanted to warn the people, but I know that people will just be dragging out the reboot because they have "important" things to do. Like finish watching that youtube clip with the hot chick, or do some work on their important resume. So... power was pulled. Future me won't be pleased with myself should it come back to bite my a$$.
 Switch rebooted - and the one blade did not come back up. Found the fault, yay.
 But it also cut out the internet because our CPE was connected to that specific blade. Took a little juggling around of cables, but we got everything up again.
 Now we will have to wait for a replacement blade, but in the meantime things should be OK for now.
 And the good news is, that slowness is now gone.
 I t was bound to pop sooner or later anyway, better that it popped whilst the expert was there.

Our parent company just added these to the Solarwinds instance, but do not actually monitor anything "power related" (outlet usage, voltage in/out, etc). All they show is historical availability, ping/packet loss, and basic device info.
 I was wondering...
  
What options exist for monitoring these types of devices? (electricity, ping, connected devices, etc)
 What do you specifically look at?
 Anything else I should be aware of?

 I understand that the specs on the monitors need to show 16.7 million colors. Where I'm confused is what spec do I need to look at for the graphics card in a laptop or desktop pc. For example, when looking at a laptop that comes with 
 Intel UHD Graphics 630
 and 
 i5-10500T processor,
 nowhere on the intel specs page do I see anything related to 16.7 million colors or 32-bit color.
 Intel Core i510500T Processor 12M Cache up to 3.80 GHz Product Specifications 
 If anyone can point me in the right direction, I'd really appreciate it.

 I am having an issue with one of our customers (work in an MSP).
 On their host server (win svr 16 std) they have a data drive where they only have some VM VHDX files stored. Windirstat reports that approx. 850 GB is being used.
 But Windows reports that there is 204GB free of2.17TB.
 We are unable to find what is causing this disparity.
 We initially thought the issue was due to shadow copies from their anti-virus, but we've deleted all the shadow copies and it only cleared a small amount of space. Shadow copies are now set to only use 10% of each drive. There was an issue with the previous version of the AV client that would fill the drive with shadow copies, however this was resolved in the latest patch.
 We believe that there is still space allocated to, or hidden shadow copies, however windows reports that only approx. 90gb is used for shadow copies.
 We're stumped on this one, any ideas? Has anyone seen this before.
 Happy to provide more info where I can.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I thought you folks might be interested in an email scam I received yesterday; an email that said I had an outstanding invoice that needed to be paid from PayPal.
 Now I obviously this tripped my scam senses, but it had made it to my inbox through google's spam stuff and I couldn't immediately work out how it was a scam, the email appeared genuine, it did actually come from PayPal, it had passed SPF, DKIM etc, all links went to genuine PayPal URLs.
 It was then I realised what the scammers had done.
 PayPal lets you use them for invoicing, if you have a PayPal business account (or more likely if scammers have access to a compromised PayPal business account) you can go "Create me an invoice, send it to this email address, with this information in it"
 They raised a real invoice for $500 and in the information where you're supposed to put details about the invoice they had just put "This money will be invoiced immediately, If you wish to contact us about this charge, please phone xxx xxxx xxx", at which point you end up with a scam call centre who will work you through some sort of banking refund scam like you see on Kitboga, Jim Browning and Mark Rober et al.
 But for all intents and purposes, this looks like a real email that has genuinely come from PayPal, because it really has genuinely come from PayPal.
 One to watch out for.

 Country C:- Corp LAN- Corp WIFI
 Countries A through C all have their DHCPs via Windows Server.
 To pass compliance, he - manually enters EACH machine's MAC address for WIFI and LAN (DHCP reservation) - so giving the illusion that - you can't plug your personal machine onto corporate network - when we all know - MAC address cloning is a way to bypass.
 The problem comes when people travel between countries and can't connect to network, so he adds their MAC to that country's DHCP server
 So the question to my fellow sysadmins, what solutions / products are there on the market to make this less painful to manage?

 Sorry if this is not the place to post this
 I have been asked to look into getting a new server for the CCTV we have. We use Avigilon with HIKvison cameras, the server will need to work for 75 cameras and keep 14 days of footage.
 We don't have the funds to get one from Avigilon they're not cheep 
 The current server is showing its age, it's a Xeon E3-1220v5 with 8GB and 16TB of storage (H730 card) from Avigilon look like so kind of dell server i think.
 i have no idea what makes a good CCTV server so any help will be grate

 my company acquired a customer who is using Lotus Domino 9 with no absolute intention to switch to other products (Exchange Online, etc...).
 We use Veeam Backup & Replication to make backups and replicas of the entire virtualized infrastructure (hypervisor is VMware).
 I spoke with the company who manages Lotus Domino and they told me that almost all backup products are not compatibile with LD databases i.e. even Veeam can fail to backup it through VSS causing inconsistencies when restoring data. According to this company, the only ways to make it work are: 
  
update to LD v12 that has some internal features to manage backups.
 use Veeam with batch scripts to stop LD services at the beginnning of the job and to make them start at the end
  
This customer have an ancient backup software, Symantec Backup Exec 2012, that used to backup the LD database but right now is not working. I know nothing about LD and I know this is a hell of a situation.
 Still, I wanted to know what do you do in these cases, do you know a software that works with LD DBs? What is it your experience with LD DBs?

 Oh what is this email from our Network & Firewall guys about one of our ISPs (Spectrum) accidentally turned off our circuit but it's back up? Not related to this since Teams is pinned to Verizon currently but let me do some stuff to verify everything is OK. It is.
 03:00 Time to go back to bed...oh, Teams status has turned green. Light me double check. Ru-roh, we're still down. curl -vk https://teams.microsoft.com is getting resets. Works from home to the same IP address.
 Fire up tcpdump on our outbound ISP load balancers (link controllers)...yep, we're receiving RST packets from Microsoft -- i.e. they're actively rejecting us for some reason sigh
 Should I mention we have zero, zilch, no access to our tenant and need to engage $corporateOverlords whose native language is not English for any information regarding anything hosted by Microsoft?
 Reconfigure the load balancer to send Teams traffic out our generic outbound Verizon IP instead of the one that is dedicated to Teams...we're back up. 
 Email boss to tell him $corporateOverlords will need to look up the logs or contact Microsoft for an explanation.

 As some time did pass by since the Broadcom acquisition of VMWare, some of you did eventually move over to another product.

 I am still evaluating:
 XCP-ng
  
Offers 24/7 Enterprise support
 Has some performance limitations with single-threaded storage processes
 No application aware backups
 Active community
 Very responsive developer-team
  
​
 Proxmox
  
VERY limited enterprise support (austrian business hours)
 Very flexible storage backend support
 No application aware backups
 Active community
  
​
 I think, backups are an important point, that is not great for both solutions. A solution with limited enterprise support

 What are your thoughts?

So far passing files from one to another is done using usb drives. I was thinking of connecting the PC with the internet to one of the PCs in the offline network and use a simple ftp server using Python scripts to automate this process. 
 Now the question is, will that beat the purpose of the "offline" lan network security? Is there any standard way of keeping the Internet and the lan network fully seperate, like transfer the files ONLY through the python script and keep the lan network invisible from the Internet. Or no matter what I do, there will always be vulnerabillities and the 2 networks can't be truly seperate once a there is a wired connection between them?

Has anyone else felt this way? It's like imposter syndrome but only because I'm doing better than some others.
 I can usually find the answer to any problem or work with the right people effectively to solve most issues but I feel like I'm lazy, I make mistakes, I don't go after certifications, I don't homelab, I have lukewarm social skills, I'm not amazing at interviews, I don't network very well, my written skills are average at best, I can't clearly state my thoughts to executives, and sometimes I'm just overall inefficient at my job. 
 Yet I know I'm capable of doing my current job without a doubt, but I worry about being replaced by someone better constantly.
 So when I see someone stuck in a T1 job for like 4 years, it makes me question whether or not I deserve to be in IT Manager role after only 6 years. It makes me think I've just relied on luck or white privilege this whole time.
 This is by no means bragging. I just want to know if anyone has felt this way before?

 No changes to OS level prior to the issue.
  
I have been reading that turning off the TCP timestamp resolved this issue. However, I am concerned as this may have performance consequences. 
 Appreciate any response. Thanks!

I’d love to be able to permanently retain departed c-suite data (email and OneDrive) while freeing up licensing, rest of staff data retained for a set time without licensing. Who out there has great automations in place that tend to these things in a systematic way where no one is having to log when user accounts can be unlicensed and/or deleted? What policies do you enforce to make the whole offboarding process simple, clear, and streamlined?

 This is just a desktop without local network.
 What else I can check to track why PC acts like this.

 PS. Also, there are 2 wifi routers in cascade with 2 different NATs. This is happening for a main router (which is connected to modem). When switching wifi to secondary wifi router (connected to LAN port of primary router) than issue disappear.

 We have a lot of issues specifically with Gmail having significant delays with delivery that were looked at by others in the role before me. Ultimately we want to get rid of Listserv as even their cloud option isn’t cheap. Are there any good alternatives out there others have used? I found Gaggle Mail, which sounds like a good potential replacement but I need to research it further.
 I’m curious to know other’s experience or if they’ve used something else.

The more I read, the deeper the rabbit hole seems to go. Note that this is for a small company that doesn't have any industry-specific cyber security regulations though certain regulations are stipulated in the insurance we have for potential cyber attacks. There are some obvious settings that should be turned on, but I'm not finding any particular guides online for a minimum secure configuration. Anyone have any helpful resources?

 However, if we did that, we would have no reporting or auditing showing the current status of each system.
 Is there a GPO or registry setting for Windows that accomplishes the same thing so that the configuration can be easily audited?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm relatively certain I know the answer on this one, but wanted to get some outside confirmation - a type 2 route redistribution into OSPF will have a flat metric throughout the OSPF topology (1 if redistributing from BGP, 20 if redistributing from anything else, at least for Cisco's implementation). 
 In contrast, for type 1 routes, the router doing the redistribution into OSPF doesn't try to add any cost based on the protocol it's being redistributed from. Say router XYZ is redistributing a static route to 5.5.5.0/24 as a type 1 route. Would it be correct to say that other OSPF routers in the topology calculate the metric for 5.5.5.0/24 based on their cost to reach router XYZ, and that router XYZ's perceived metric to reach 5.5.5.0/24 doesn't matter (static routes seem to have a "metric" in show ip route of 0 anyway)? If you had your reference bandwidth set to 10g, it wouldn't matter if the static route to 5.5.5.0/24 had a next-hop address associated with an interface running at 10g, 1g, or 100m; the OSPF topology is only considering the cost to reach router XYZ, and router XYZ won't try to artificially inflate the OSPF cost if the bandwidth on that interface changes.

I'm doing some labbing and want to set up a network that utilizes some VPNS that will be using certificates for the user and device authentication. Most all of my experience is simply with shared secrets. I've gone through security training and know what most of the components of PKI are individually, and I've generated certs in small projects before. However, getting an idea of how this infrastructure would be built and maintained well is kind of beyond me. 
 ​
 Can anyone recommend some good resources to go through that would give me a good idea of what I need to build up, and how it would all sort of function together? It seems like it's that odd part that isn't networking but plenty of times it's our responsibility.

Nothing was standard, alerting all over the place, I got to do all sorts of cool things. Worked on my own automation projects, build redundancy in for offices, actually saw things that could be improved, proposed the solutions and was given the green light. Felt I was actually contributing and making a difference, it was hectic however it was also fun.
 I ended up quitting in august 2021 to study and travel. Got my CCNP and got a job at a large financial company. Everything here is so dialed in that I ssh into a device maybe twice a week. Haven’t even needed a console cable cause our OOB is setup well. Everything is automated, alerting on point and Im realizing how green I am because I have zero ideas of how to improve anything. I find myself only really sending emails, working with vendors to get gear, ISPs to get circuits, plan office expansions and never ending meetings. I feel I don’t actually do any networking stuff. Spoke to my manager about this and he said ‘welcome to being a senior engineer….’ Not only am I in no way a senior but is this really the future of this career path? I am finding it so boring and have none of that tinkering/ trying to get something to work. 
 I understand my job is to provide reliable network access, but holy hell is it boring when it all works well…..

 How does one go about actually building a netconf xml based yang model for this? From what I understand you need to determine which yang structures should be used to build your xml netconf from.

I never really liked IT, but was generally good at it and it paid well. The best jobs are when I had a fun team, worst have been from bad management. I eventually change jobs for whatever reason: company closing, management, bored, whatever. I have always thought about changing professions during my career, but I don’t know if I would feel better doing that or not. Or have any idea what I would do anyway. I don’t like the idea of continually changing jobs, especially in my 50s, I average about 2-3 years per job, but I am pretty sure I am not in the right place to finish my career in 15-20 years.
 I never felt fulfilled or proud of my career path, and dread mondays and going into the office 3 times a week, but the days go by quickly given that every day is different. All in all, things are ok, I’m hybrid, get paid well, little work outside my 40 hours, my management leaves me alone, I’ve always gotten good reviews when I had them. I don’t really connect with my team, and fear I would be released if layoffs come. Some days, it’s a struggle staying above water from both the complexity and quantity of work, most days I stare at the clock waiting for quitting time.
 For the most part I’ve been an admin: windows, linux, storage, virtualization, cloud, and dabbled a bit in of security, databases, scripting, networking. Not sure if I should stay where I am, switch to a similar job as admin, change to something like IT security , or change careers entirely.
 Where are you at? Experiencing the same feelings? Am I burnt out or being whiny?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[**EDIT** 
 We took a capture from the F5's during the failover. There is no ARP being sent from the PA. When an F5 BIG-IP fails over, it will GARP, finding the routers Gateway. This will fulfill the PA's ARP table. After 30 minutes exactly (the ARP cache refresh timer) the PA will drop the entry because it will not send an ARP for the F5 virtual-server IP. Basically, we're only seeing connectivity at failover due to the F5 GARP for the router's Gateway IP. 
 Has anyone ever experienced a Palo Alto not sending ARP for a singular IP on a subnet before? Or, could someone maybe explain why this is happening?

 Like CPU load can be very low and it will not pass that much traffic. Then looking at premade appliances it seems the cpu is not that important to the amount of threw-put a box is capable of. 
 So my question is, if the cpu is not doing the cyphering then what is?

 I had a job for three months with an MSP and none of the techs liked me there. I got fired due to culture fit. At my current job I am bashing with my bosses boss as well as an app consultant because I am asking questions or detailing the frustrations that the users have with our equipment and software when it seems like nothing is getting fixed.
 How do you learn how to keep your head down and work with technologies or even people you think are inferior? Is it the fact that I don't have the knowledge that I think I do? Is it the politics of crappy workplaces? I have 8-10 years of IT exp and still generally help desk support at various roles/companies, could that be the reason? 
 Why do I think IT should be about investigating problems and making sure they get fixed and do not reoccur when in reality it is actually about putting bandaids on things until you can't take it anymore and leave? I guess this is why they call hell desk hell. Even though I generally don't have the problem with dealing with users like most people lolz.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys. Our company is evaluating the transition from on prem servers to cloud servers, and I'd like to ask for your advice. Our current environment includes 2 sites while each site has 1 Windows server (to work as DC, DHCP and print server) + 1 Windows file server. GPOs are in place to mount network drives and printers. We also have NSA to work as firewalls and VPN connections for remote users.
 Our major plan is to replace the file servers with Nasuni edge appliances. That will bring us 'small cache file server' to each location. But the executives are considering replacing the current DCs to cloud VM. 
 From my premature understanding of cloud resources, this looks possible by running a VM with site-to-site VPN connection to on prem networks. Remote users will still connect VPN before they could reach the DC for authentication. But would there be any issues/concerns for the features like AD, printing, DNS, GPO, etc.?

This was a impromptu solution to losing our IPS. The 3rd FTD is a routed firewall in our equinix location. Currently I have a rule on the FMC that says any zone any source any destination with the application Spotify set to Block. 
 I would figure that rules would follow the top down pattern and say if its not spotify traffic then move it along to the next rule. Instead whenever I do a packet tracer it hits that rule with a allow on about any piece of traffic I do... So basically its a permit ip any any. 
 What am I doing wrong ?

I get the security aspect and how it does more to authenticate users and devices than just saying "Oh you're on the domain? You're good." However, it seems to be purely security. I don't see how it actually connects you to the network? It looks more like something you would use in tandem with a VPN, but everyone talks about it as a one or the other type of thing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am having an issue with the BGP failover and trying to find the best way to solve it. Topology is here: https://ibb.co/myN4xXn
 I did not design this network, I inherited it. My knowledge of BGP is shallow but I used it successfully in many simple networks.
 Site 2 uses Site 1's ExpressRoute to reach Azure when MPLS and Site 1's ExpressRoute are available. When not site 2 uses direct site to site VPN tunnel to reach Azure. Failover and failback work correctly when MPLS fails, but I am running into issues when ExpressRoute fails. When ExpressRoute fails Site 1 still advertises routes to Site 2 because it learns them through Site 1's site to site VPN. I don't want that.
 Site 2 uses weight to prioritize "MPLS" over Site to Site VPN to Azure. In Azure I am pre-pending AS to make one path less desirable.
 What I simply want to do is prevent Site 1 from advertising Azure routes to site 2 when they are learned through Site to Site VPN, but for some reason I can't wrap my head on how to do that. I know I need to use a route-maps to do it, but how to configure the route map and where to apply it is the question.
 Conceptually I think I need to first tag/identify routes when they are learned through site to site VPN Azure BGP neighbor, and then I need to deny those routes from being advertised to site 2.
 Right now I am using same route-map on site 1 for both Azure BGP neighbors. I think I will need to split that and use different route-map for each neighbor. 
 It seems that I can use "community", "origin", "tag", and "route-tag" to make routes from one neighbor different than others.
 On premise equipment are FortiGate firewalls and ideally I like to make all changes on them. I want to avoid, if possible, to make changes in Azure.

 This program uses the ms-graph api to get all the apps, configuration policies etc. and displays the result in a GUI. You can even export your findings.
 From a safety aspect u probably should get a c# programmer to look into it, before using it in your main tenant. But I tried it on our test tenant and it just worked. (and ofc I only gave the user I used a read-only role)

I want to implement the below design, where the core switch would be connected with trunk ports to the INSIDE interfaces of both firewalls, then the OUTSIDE interfaces would come back to the core switch on access ports on VLAN X, and we connect to the ISP on an access port on VLAN X. We do "sw mode access" and "sw nonegatiate" on those OUTSIDE switch interfaces and, of course, prune VLAN X from the trunks to mitigate VLAN attacks.

 I have been told by my colleagues that our IA people will freak out, and will not accept having the INSIDE and OUTSIDE networks on the same hardware. Does anyone know of any documentation, or design guides, or proof of concepts from reputable sources that I can take to convince them this is a secure design?
 Conversely, if someone knows a specific exploit that makes this unsecure, please share.

 I was asked to take a look at the bill a customer is receiving from the local phone/internet company. I actually don't know what is normal for these, I don't typically see the bill, and was hoping for some help.
 They have dedicated fiber and there are two spots on the bill that lists our circuit number. I'll alter the numbers slightly but leave the ratio between the two amounts.
 The first item says "Dedicated Internet" and is 800.00 That makes sense to me.
 The second line items says "Megalink Port per DS1 Rental Period of 36" and is 650.00
 Not sure what that second one is. Is that a rental for their gear? Is that normal? 
 We have the typical small box from the carrier with our circuit on it with the cables coming in from somewhere in the building to it with a Cat6 cable hanging off it we plug into our firewall. I hope we are not renting that.

 All the tools I've seen are for endpoint management and are therefore expensive. We don't need all that jazz.
 Are there affordable tools out there that you use? Seems like everyone wants $20/machine or $1000 a year.
 I readied 100 machines last year. Took too much time.
 I tried getting WDS/MDT going, and got about 90% there but am having authentication issues when it comes to accessing the share in WinPE.

 Then I have setup Google Password Sync to sync the passwords for our users. 
  
I change password for a user in my AD
 The user can now sign in to admin.google.com fx
 The new password just set in the AD works, but after the user signed in it will instantly prompt users to change password again?
 I would want it to not prompt the user to change password online in Google after the password is set in the AD, does anybody have a clue on what setting to look at here :) ?

 My configuration looks good, but the devices still doesn't get enroll in Intune because they have been MDE onboarded before.
 So, to go from MDE to a real Intune enrollment, do I need to wipe the device, or a better solution exist, I can't find the solution...

 When I add a user to the Configuration Profile it eventually asks them to reboot, then they try to login and it asks them to setup Windows Hello. Once they complete the setup they try and enter the PIN they just set and get “This option is currently unavailable” and they can only login with their domain password.
 After a bit of time the PIN suddenly starts working and I have no idea why.
 This is a hybrid environment so I suspect a password sync needs to happen before Windows Hello will work properly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good day
 I have a client that has an engineer working from abroad. This person connects to a virtual machine on a server that shares an NVIDIA Tesla GPU to draw CAD models. If the engineer is on-site at the office, connection is established through a site-to-site VPN. If he works from home, he dials in to the main office through client VPN. Ping ranges from 200 to 250 ms.
 The performance of the virtual machine is sufficient, but since we are using RDP there are significant limitations to the user experience. Manipulating models or watching videos is - as you may expect - laggy and not very pleasant.
 I followed this manual and allowed H.264/AVC hardware encoding in the local group policies of the machine. There is a significant improvement compared to the regular RDP settins. Can you think of other ways to boost the user experience when working over RDP? How do I get the most out of this protocol? Thanks for all the suggestions.
 Before you bash me for this setup - it was not my idea - I inherited the setup from my predecessor.

 Is there something need to be changed in the config due to some openvpn update or something is going bad?

 In the past when you gave Full Access to a users mailbox through the GUI in Exchange to another user this did not allow the delegate to see Private Items this was always an additional setting within Outlook that the user would have to set.
 It seems now this has changed and that when you assign a delegate to a mailbox through the GUI this also gives that delegate access to the Users Private Items.
 I should add this seems to only have changed recently on Cloud Exchange
 Microsoft have confirmed seemingly this is by design which has actually raised a big concern of privacy.
 Has anyone else had anything similar?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoping this community has a solution for our need. We run a network on a military installation for personal use internet connectivity. We need a means to test internet speeds at about 10 buildings of the 200 we are connected via cable, switches and PTP radios. We have a 1Gb broadband connection which we give soldiers 50 down and 2 up. Last year we decided to try it with Raspberry pi4’s but they seem impossible to get our hands on anymore. We did get 2 last year and loaded with speedtest cli. We distributed these to two buildings and it works flawlessly. Getting old laptops or old pc’s running in attics would work but I’m looking for something small like a raspberry that I can plug into a switch in an attic get my stats and dump them into g drive. Or perhaps there is a small IOT device that is purpose build to do that. I’m trying to stay in raspberry pricing per unit. Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, long time lurker short time poster - forgive me for formatting. We have a strange issue TAC support are taking weeks to resolve (even as a P2 ticket), I wondered if anyone else has experienced this issue. 
 We have 250 APs, around 12 of those are R500 the rest R510. These are connected to a vSZ controller with non-proxied radius requests. A couple times a day, the entire cluster will drop connections and no one regardless of PSK SSID or an 802.1x SSID can connect. In this time, you cannot SSH into an AP and invariably you cannot SSH into the vSZ either. Ruckus Support seem to be having problems pinpointing the issue in logs and have repeatedly asked for logs between 3-5 mins after the issue occurs. Our controller is running 6.1.0.0.935, R510 running 6.1.0.0.1595 and R500 5.2.1.0.1038 
 We see a lot of AP-Disconnected events along with RADIUS server unreachable at the time of the incident. Has anyone experienced this issue themselves?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently trying to double down on some bad practises we have on company PCs. I have removed all users as local admins on their PC, due to users installing some applications which are not work related.
 Some of these users are Technicians which go on client sites to troubleshoot products, which require them to change their Laptop NIC Card IP Address and install drivers. 
 I have solved the NIC Card issue by including their AD account in the 'Network Configuration Operators' Local Group on each of their PCs respectively.
 The driver install problem I can't seem to wrap my head around. They only need to install drivers from a specific vendor, lets call them 'Vendor A'.
 Is there a way to enforce a GPO on these users, which allows them to install applications and drivers by 'Vendor A' only without the need of admin credentials, while asking for admin credentials for any other app/driver install?
 I have searched the web for a solution and found there is a way to have trusted and untrusted publishers in an AD, but wasn't able to make it work as I need it. 
 This is for around 10 users running Windows 10, connected to an AD installed on windows server 2016. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

The old ones have come back and the company wants to essentially wipe them and either give them to employees, or charity, as they are fully functional, just no longer fit for our site due to cyberessentials+
 Lucky me: the user's don't remember what pin numbers they had set on 3 of the phones and they had decided it was a good idea to make a random one (so IT can wipe the phone easier)... Then they forgot the code.. and the devices had already been deleted from airwatch....
 I've looked online and all I really see are jailbreakers and paid pin unlock suites, I'm wondering if anyone knows of a free tool that can either remove the pin, or fully factory reset the devices (I've tried iTunes and the usual recovery with no joy), or if there is a way to re-enroll the devices back into airwatch temporarily to use the pin removal tool?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I’m a sys admin in a team of three that own several applications as well as their hosting environments. I’m six months into this new job and have suddenly been thrown into a couple projects. 
 Unfortunately for me, my boss threw me into an ongoing project cycle due to one of our sys admins being out for several weeks, so I’m in the fire. I’ve been given a technical documentation by our vendor which I’m told is full of useless and confusing information and I need to basically decipher and translate it to work for the environment we have. I’m still new to our environment and applications so figuring out how to make this work within our infrastructure is extremely daunting. There are people I can ask for help but many of them are busy with their own tasks and projects and I don’t want to come off as helpless. 
 The company I work for is ridiculously understaffed and unorganized, so there is zero structure or timeline to these projects as well as very conflicting deadlines. I’ve literally been asked if it was possible to take this new project given to me and implement the entire thing in a non prod environment within 24 hours, no freaking way. All the while being asked by product managers and my boss for constant updates on other projects assigned to me. It’s extremely soul crushing. I’m so new to everything that it seems impossible to get anything done within the time frames they’re asking for and give updates. The micro managing is extremely severe to the point where I am asked for a project update every single hour, most of the time I’m still trying to figure out what to do and don’t have an answer. If I’m lucky one of the more senior guys will schedule a meeting with me later in the day to point me in the right direction. I’m starting to feel like I’m just not smart enough for this role and want out of IT completely because it seems like I run into this same issue with every job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hate SCCM, never like it. It takes too much effort to maintain and it only works 50% of the time. 
 In saying that, Im trying to install Teams using Teams Wide Installer during a Task Sequence. It installs successfully and drops a Teams.exe in Program Files (x86) for a 64-bit installer and a registry key:
 Hive: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run 
 Name : Teams Wide Machine Installer
 Type: Reg_Expand_SZ
 Value: %ProgramFiles%\Teams Installer\Teams.exe --checkInstall --source=default
 So according to Microsoft Documentation : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/msi-deployment
 Whenever a user signs into new Windows user profile, the installer is launched and will install teams in %LocalAppData%\Microsoft\Teams
 However, the user install does not happen. When the user logs in, they can find Teams anywhere. The only workaround to install teams is for them to to Program Files (x86)\Teams Installer and run Teams.exe. 
 This happens to all new builds and the user logs in for the first time. Anyone have similar experience or perhaps any SCCM guru that can shed some light on this? Any advice would be really appreciated

 We have another set of servers that was deployed by our MSP as a hyper-v cluster before I joined and I’m not impressed. Things I can easily do in vSphere are either overly complicated or just don’t work as well. 
 The two things holding me back from going vSphere are keeping uniformity across systems and the uncertainty of the Broadcom deal. 
 I’ve got more experience with vSphere which is why I’m leaning that way and can easily justify the extra licensing on the cost our MSP would charge for all the migrations if we went hyper-v. 
 Any thoughts or advice?

 What are the other attributes in a live log? Is it radius request from the switch to ise or ISE to switch. I know the result is what ISE is pushing role/DACL? Need little understanding on ISE. 
 When I debug radius logs in switch? Does it show access request and access response logs in debugs. How do we differentiate from access request and access response. 
 Sorry if my questions doesnt make sense.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's say I have an iPerf downlink running for an hour (-t 3600 -p 5201 to 5210), and something happens to the connection and it stops 3 minutes in while on port 5201, which of course, it means that it's in use until the timer runs down or you restart the iPerf server.
 Let's say that the test coordinators insist you keep running it and switch ports, but you've already burnt through all 10 of them. Even worse, even after an hour it still says the ports are in use, and there is only a scheduled restart at midnight, and your shift is 9 AM.
 Is there a command or something I can run to free up a stuck port? The resources I'm reading online isn't exactly helping, and this is holding me back from a MUCH better assignment. Thanks!

 I'm transitioning into a networking role soon and will be dealing with a lot of phones and collaboration tools. This is all pretty new to me except I am familiar with basic networking. I'm looking for an all in one guide or video to learn the basics and get a good grasp before jumping off the deep end.
 I'll be working with Teams (Direct Routing + Operator Connect), Zoom Phones, Cisco Call Manager, and some Vonage. I've already gone through some knowledge base articles with these vendors but I still don't feel like I have a good baseline. I'm not looking for how to use these specifically more like what is a SBC, how do number translations work, what's a SIP trunk, PTSN vs toll-free, etc. Anyone able to point me in the right direction for something like this?
 Thanks!!

What I mean is placing all users in a common L2 domain behind one L3 gateway and prevent lateral connections between them? Most controller-based wireless solution would have 'LAN isolation' feature to enforce this but how would one do this with a bunch of stand-alone access switches? I had a look at private VLAN but that seems to require manual configuration on all switches.

Looking to peel off 80/443 from AnyConnect clients and send to Palo so we can disable Zscaler PAC file. Currently have set up ACL for test client, tied to route-map (that points to Palo) and assigned to WAN interface. Testing shows that ACL/route-map is hit and should send to Palo but unable to see anything in pcaps on the ASA or Palo indicating outbound web based traffic is leaving the ASA. Debug shows hits:
 br: policy based route lookup called for 10.5.33.10/63738 to 172.217.168.227/443 proto 6 sub_proto 0 received on interface WAN
 pbr: First matching rule from ACL(21)
 pbr: route map AnyConnect_to_Palo, sequence 10, permit; proceed with policy routing
 pbr: evaluating next-hop 10.5.7.23
 Packet tracer shows its getting dropped on NAT, phase 14, rpf-check, as its not expecting traffic from that subnet on that interface. In theory, it sounds like it should work but Im not seeing where its getting dropped to the Palo. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated. Ill attach a basic topology too. Thanks.
 Edit: Reason behind design is that the Zscaler service contract is up on 12/31 and looking to not renew for an entire year when we need maybe an extra few weeks in to 2023 to move all end users to GlobalProtect.

As we speak, I am constantly being pinged by a new hire because no one is teaching him how do anything. I'm talking about functional things related to his job, like workflows, software tools beyond normal "here is your computer, this is how you log on to the network and email" type stuff. 
 Shouldn't it logically be his team or supervisor teaching him? I only have a peripheral idea what/how they work, so I'm sure I'm not 100% telling him the "right way". I keep stressing that he needs to ask other people, but no one else is answering him. 
 I'd say it was an org issue, but it was this way to an extent at previous employer as well. I trained people across the organization there as well.

 I'm a fairly new network associate at a huge workplace (~40K employees), and it bugs me beyond belief that not a single decent topology drawing of the company's bigass network exists.
 I'm mingling with the thought of starting the project of mapping the entire infrastructure of the company (it's a huge project which will never be complete, I know), but I don't think a tool like Visio or Drawio would cut it, since it would become too huge too fast (unless these programs have functionalities that I don't know about).
 Is there any tool out there for drawing up massive topologies? I'm thinking about 'layering' functions like e.g. a geographical topology where I might open up a location, where I might choose between e.g. physical, L2 or L3 topologies pr. location, etc. A cascading system, if you will, where only the wished for information is displayed at a time.
 Hope the question makes sense!

From my understanding, this needs to be an FQDN/DNS, otherwise the certificate for the Session Server would be invalid. Anybody any insights, how i can force the Load balancer broker to offer me the hostname/FQDN/dns name of the session server? 
 Or should the Broker give me an hostname and i did something wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I am a sysadmin in a company and I manage around ~170 Servers. Some of them are phyiscal, some virtual. Most of them run Windows Server 2012 / 2016 /2019 as their OS, but we also got some Linux Servers.
 So now our issue: We literally got almost no documention for our servers. We have list of our hostnames, but that is it.
 To better understand our current state: Recently our main FTP Server broke down because the Windows OS was broken. The server was not bootable anymore and therefore the config for the FTP server (IIS) was lost. Of course, no one knew how the FTP Service was configured in terms of directories, local users and other software. So we build up a new Server from scratch (which was the easy part) and talked to every service provider usising this FTP Server and telling them that the credentials and hostname / IP has changed (which was the not so nice part).
 We recently got the brilliant idea that it might be good to know what kind of Servers we have, which applications they are running and how they are configured.
 The first idea from one of my colleagues was to make a word document for every server, where we can wright the specs inside, which applications it runs and what steps were taken to configure the software (with screenshots). But yeah, let's just not do that....
 And now my question: What is the best practice for Server documentation? I googled a bit of course and found some tools for documentation, but most of them are not free for testing or just don't look that good to use.
 The way to document should have some kind automation to it and have a nice usability, so that my colleagues stay motivated to document.
 So should be just something dull like Word, Excel or Visio (which is easy but frustrating to use) or some kind of software, which scans our servers and document them? I think a hybrid of both things would be nice

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a question for publishing printers by site bsaed on the following design requirement:
 Implementing a print release system to use follow-me print across all sites.
 Management want just one print queue published
 We could publish one print queue from one server and allow the system to manage the follow-me function, but there's also the requirement to ensure local print facilities are available in the case of a single site failure / link failure.
 It appears to be a limitation of the system we are using (or the design we've gone with) to have failover across sites - though I am also checking with our managed print provider, as I'm not the project manager just the technical lead.
 Currently using group policy, print perferences then item-level filtering to say if at X site then create printerX@serverX.com
 If at site Y create printerY@serverY.com etc.
 What I'd like to do is avoid a build up of printers in their list though, so if at site X I only want X printer deployed to that device. If they then take that laptop to site Y, deploy printer Y on login but remove printer X. The plan is the queue name would be the same on each server so to the end user it "looks" like one queue wherever they go
 Is that even possible? I worry it could increase logon times
 Any other suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We use shared local admin accounts with password auth on the infrastructure I inherited (~6 admins, many (hundreds) of machines). This worries me, any ex employee will still have access unless we go and change a lot of passwords. Automation is not really a thing here yet (I know, I know).
 Looking for a better solution I started to create an ansible playbook to roll out authentication via sssd/ldap. This basically works, everyone from the "sysadmin" group can now login via ssh and their individual passwords on my test machine. Accounts are automatically granted sudo rights based on group membership.
 Now, I have a couple of questions with respect to this approach:
  
Is there a way to preseed the sssd cache before first login? An admin might have to handle an emergency on a machine he’s never logged into and at that moment ldap might not be available. If not, any recommended alternative approaches?
 
I would prefer key auth over passwords but I don’t have much control over the AD/LDAP infrastructure so I don’t think I can store public keys there (and delegate ssh key lookup / caching to sssd). I could rollout and revoke keys via ansible but I’m unsure on how that would play with sssd/ldap. Like, when an account is locked in AD but still has an authorized key, can they still login?
 
Given all admins have sudo rights, what would be required steps to make sure they can't access servers after they left? E.g. would we have to cleanout their authorized_keys in addition to disabling their users in AD/LDAP?
 
 Any inputs are appreciated.

 I've a frontend server with fpm 8.1 and nginx.
 2 cores and 4gb of RAM.
 A few days ago I upgraded from 18.04 to 22.04. I've kept the php fpm and cli version and did not change any fpm settings.
 Since the upgrade fpm consumes on average more cpu and I even run into issues that the fpm pools cant work the requests and I receive timeouts. 
 I can see that the load is close to 0 in the night when I dont have any traffic. And my traffic did not change in a way since the upgrade that might explain the higher need of cpu. 
 Is there any known issue regarding this? Any other package versions that come with 22.04 that might interfere with fpm?
 Thank you!

 When I look at the slots from outside the first two from left are used:

 I have no idea how to make sure that the services that we use are managed from somewhere central. I have seen some stuff can be done by playing around with SAML SSO and organisation setup in GSuite, but even like that, most of the services don't use SAML SSO, and most of them don't have API's.
 So, how do you manage all the services your company uses and the permissions within them?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[so im a sys admin at a startup and currently ive been requested to setup a small network for the office
 the network would basically be :
 the modem (supplied by our ISP so its a shitty basic modem) > a firewall (ive never setup one of these ) > a big switch (that we have on a small rack at the office) > 10 tables with 6 user per table (there is a cisco sg300-10 switch on each table) and 4 access points 
 everything besides the modem is Cisco so im guessing there wont be any compatibility issues but ive never setup a network so im unsure of the things ill need (data/info about my network, certificates, etc), best practices, things to look for, tools, test that should be done, general rules, monitoring, security, etc
 so if somebody could help me out and tell me the "procedure/process" you guys personally go trough when setting up an enterprise network or point me in the direction i need to go it would be very appreciated
 my networking experience is limited as before ive only worked in "big" companies and on those ive always had a network engineer or similar taking care of this

 ​
 I have a small office and would like to separate my internet into 3 segregated wifi signals for "security" purpose.
 -1 Wifi for Clients
 -1 Wifi for the public
 -1 Wifi for the staff and myself.
 ​
 As it is not possible for me to have cables pulled in the building(cost reason), will 3 wifi help with the security of the internet?
 All my staff PCs have kasperky cloud
 But for the public and client wifi, as I cannot control their devices, I am worried that viruses/trojans infect the Pcs of my staff. Would 3 wifis, help with this issue?
 ​
 Would you know any piece of hardware that could allow me this please?
 The covering radius is about 25 meters.
 ​
 Thanks all!

 I hope someone is able to help.
 I'm trying to setup Workspace in Outlook for our hybrid environment, but I can't get it to work 100%.
 I've tried creating a distribution group, but the distribution group isn't showing. These are on prem and not cloud, so what I've done is to create a new in the same OU and provide it same attributes as for one that's working - but it's not showing.
 Also, when googling around I see pictures showing "Type: Workspaces" which I can't see in ours - we don't have the Type button.
 I'm new in this position, so I haven't setup this before.
 Thanks and wish you all a great day :-)

 The goal:
 Preemptively install specific drivers (.inf files) and validate that they were installed by returning a specified exit code. 
 Install method:
 pnputil /add-driver $PSScriptRoot\*.inf /install
 Scratch method to discover:
 Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_PnpSignedDriver 
 What I'm finding is that pnputil is reporting that it successfully applied the .inf file yet when I look for the driver, it's missing. If I can validate the install then I can generate the exit code. This has left me trying to better understand how drivers are handled by windows. Is "applied" installed, stored, or what?

 I’m still green so this also plays into a frustration with handling items a bit slower than I’d like. I also know that I tend to ‘take on the world’ and feel reluctant to ask for help too soon. It is important that I do my due diligence before leaning into my team as I want to ensure I am carrying my weight. Getting my hands on things is also the best way for me to learn.
 As I’m writing this post I believe I may just need to vent but also ask as to whether this is the norm as a sys eng? Because if so, I truly need to adjust in the way that I handle my work and the way it ties into my mood and stress level.
 What’s y’all experience, strategies, and coping mechanisms?

 But now... occupying that same ticket 'slot' is the MFA reset requests " I broke my phone" "I changed phones" "I uninstalled the app"... is anyone else getting inundated with these now and what tooling or processes do you have in place for them? We have been using app absed number mathcing (had it enabled while in preview) as the 'main' MFA method. 
 These days with WHfB users aren't prompted for notification based MFA often - which I think is making it easier for the app based method to lapse/be forgotten about.

I jumped from a systems admin role to IT Manager with only 2.5 years of experience. Even then, I was only handling lower level tickets and worked for an MSP for a year where they literally only had be call Comcast whenever a site went down.. Anyways I feel extremely incompetent as now I’ve been pushed to a director role just 6 months of being here. I just got an intern that I am now training to help me with tasks, but even that requires so much of my time to train on top of dealing with executive meetings and last minute requests from management. 
 Anything related with equipment is basically my responsibility even if I have no idea where it came from or how it got purchased. We have a programs team that is the biggest department in our organization and yet they’re the ones that fail to manage their things and I’m now having to take ownership of their mistakes. I wonder how common this is, and what was your experience as a one man/woman IT. 
 What has helped you with stepping into a leadership role? I’m currently reading the IT Manager Guidebook since that was the only book I’ve found so far, but even so I’m so freaked out at the fact that I don’t know anything and I have so much yet to learn that it’s so overwhelming. Appreciate any advice/resources that has helped you manage a similar situation.
 (btw no disrespect to my intern when I say “1.5” they are just not fully available to assist me. So still it would be a 2 man IT department, don’t want to diminish their contribution )

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, currently we have 2 ASA's in a HA pair for our Web hosting firewalls, these firewalls directly portchannel into our border leaf ACI environment where the servers live.
 The issue is that for our outgoing Internet traffic on our other pair of ASA's, I'm going to use PBR to divert traffic to our new outgoing Palos to avoid a big bang, but for our new web hosting Palos, I can't use PBR because the border leafs go directly into the current web hosting ASA firewalls. So there is no way for me to re-route traffic to reach the new solution.
 All of the clients/servers on the webhosting side have their gateways pointed to the current interfaces on our web hosting ASA's (not on a BD in ACI). So these gateways would need to point to the new solution to. The new solution will have the same interfaces, ip's in the same networks etc... but will be different ip's. 
 I need to find a way to avoid a big bang approach of just flicking over the all the servers gateways to the new firewalls with the migrated rule sets on and hoping for the best. I'd much rather try and find a way to control traffic, like I am doing with PBR on our outgoing solution.
 Hopefully I've explained it clearly enough.
 Thanks everyone

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm in the middle of a firewall migration from ASA to Palos and have run into a couple of issues (I'll make another post if people want to check that out to as its a seperate issue). 
 For this one, we have 2 firewalls in a HA pair for our outgoing Internet traffic, we have public addresses free so I can use them on our new solution instead of being limited to the one on the current solution.
 Essentially I'm going to put a new public ipv4 address on our new solution as the physical IP, all is good expect for the issue that some of our servers use services on the Internet and these services expect the NAT'd traffic to come from our current public IP, we can't afford next to any downtime because of the business we are and we want to avoid a "big bang" approach to this to. Does anyone have any ideas how I can get around this?
 At the moment my only one is to get the services on the Internet to whitelist our entire range instead of just the physical public interface ip at the moment?
 Thanks

It’s only day two and it’s been so exhausting interacting with people all day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, our current Guest WiFi system is basically an open SSID that leads to a Meraki splash page where you enter your mobile number as a form of ID and gain access to the network.
 I've been looking at different ways to improve on this. My first thought was to use the same ID method but with a WPA3 PSK so the average Joe on the street couldn't just connect to. But this wouldn't stop someone from leaking the key I suppose in the end.
 So after that I've now thought about an approval process where possibly our 1st line helpdesk could approve access after a user enters their details in with a reason for being onsite etc...
 Has anyone implemented a process like this before. We have a Meraki AP architecture and ISE as our radius server. I was thinking/hoping that there could be a guest splash page that could link into ISE and for ISE to do some cool stuff behind the scenes with approvals.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just today we had an issue where one of the terminal servers went offline and we had to reboot it, causing multiple staff to lose their work. Upon rebooting the server everything looked fine, but we were recieving multiple calls asking if something was down, or if it was safe to log in again.
 I was thinking, it would be great if the IT department had a website we could share with users to just have us post a quick "this server went down, but services will be restored soon." or "Reminder, we are doing maintenance tonight at 10PM" messages that staff could view throughout the day. Mostly just a status and maintenance update kind of site that we can send out when there's a known issue and an all clear.
 The purpose would be, of course, if there is something acting up, staff can bring up the page quick and see that there is a problem and what we're doing to resolve, so they do not have to call in or wonder and call us to ask.
 I'm imaging like a live webpage that we can post messages, but have them read only and not allow for replies, new items go to the top and old messages are pushed down over time. Maybe we can mark older issues a resolved and important information like "If you continue to have issues, please try logging off and back in for better performance."
 Anyway, does that make sense? Is there anything like that we can utilize? I know we can send out emails to staff/groups for updates, but many things do not need to go to all staff, and not all staff need to be aware of issues impacting just certain groups or applications. We were thinking maybe Teams would have something like that, but even so Teams seems a bit underwhelming for that. I'm thinking just a landing page where we can push out quick updates.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are currently set up as a "flat" network... Layer 2 is everywhere segmented by VLANs but unfortunately, we use VLAN1 for a lot of things. We are setting up a separate location using Comcast P2P. All the things at this location would need to talk to servers on a mix of VLANS. Eventually, we want to route everything but one of my questions is does it have to be done all at once? Our initial thought is to start with this location and then move on to everything else. 
 Doing some research, I believe the most future-proof routing protocol would be OSPFv2 (correct me if I'm wrong). Is it going to be a huge headache to connect a 10.0.0.0 to a 192.168.0.0 network? Currently, everything is on 192.168. The biggest reason we want to move to layer 3 is that we have a data center connected to the main location via 2 dark fibers and 1 P2P fiber. Currently, they are separated from each other and the P2P is on a disabled port only to be enabled when the other 2 are down. The 2 dark fibers are redundant but we want to connect that 3rd one to the other 2 dark fibers. We either can't do that or can't figure out how to do that because the 2 dark fibers are 10g and the P2P is 1g.
 Is it feasible to move to layer 3? We have roughly 350 PCs, 100 printers, ~400 phones, 35 switches, and ~100 servers and I'm sure I'm missing more. We are a small team of 4 that does it all, Only 2 of us do the networking I would not call us experts by any means but we make it work. Any problems I didn't think of please let me know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey! Quick context. The company I work at NEVER deletes anything from AD. From disabled accounts to old computers/servers, they just disable them and let them be (they been doing this for like 10+ years).
 A couple months ago we started a project to clean everything and we still havent found a way to safely delete every disabled user/system (they never do it especially cause they hire a lot of consultants and a lot of them come and go and they just enable/disable their users).
 Pretty cool thing I just discovered (mind I have 0 exp on the area Im literally new on the job) is that you can export/import users. So I thought about exporting them, storage them in any fileserver and delete them from AD. If we ever decide to use them again we just import them with their groups and stuff like they where when we disabled it. Would this work?. 
 Another suggestion we had was to make "parallel OUs" and storage every disabled/thing in the same OU with some kind of designated name like "Logistic Users - Disabled" or something like that. But this would still invovle having EVERY disabled thing still there.
 ​
 What do you guys do to keep AD clean?.
 Is there any tool to keep track of disabled/enabled users? I just use powershell for everything but Im sure theres a more efficient way.

 Almost every hotel has absolutely crummy internet, and I'm trying to avoid that.
 What are your recommendations for routers and router setups to accommodate this many devices?
 This is pretty key. Is there a way to set it up where the available bandwidth is divided up by password? For example I give someone a code they can use to sign into with as many devices as they like, but the total bandwidth allotted to that password would be something like 1MBps?
 Unfortunately the internet service is Frontier, I don't think that's optional.
  
Thank you in advance for any advice, I'm fairly tech savvy but networking is out of my wheelhouse.

 route-map multipod-bgp>ospf deny 10 match tag 100 route-map multipod-bgp>ospf permit 20 set tag 200 ! route-map multipod-ospf>bgp deny 10 match tag 200 route-map multipod-ospf>bgp permit 20 set tag 100 ! router ospf 1 vrf overlay-1 router-id 10.30.19.12 redistribute bgp 65500 route-map multipod-bgp>ospf log-adjacency-changes ! router bgp 65500 vrf overlay-1 address-family ipv4 unicast redistribute direct route-map multipod-route-map redistribute ospf 1 route-map multipod-ospf>bgp 
 Now I do this for EIGRP/BGP as well, and on EIGRP L3 interfaces I also apply tags using an inbound distribute-list with the same route-map with the following syntax:
  ip distribute-list eigrp vrf-A route-map eigrp>bgp in 
 Now the question is how do I configure this same thing for an OSPF L3 interface? The commands are not the same as eigrp and don't really seem to have an analog and I can't seem to figure out how to apply a distribute-list to an OSPF L3 interface.

 I've priced out a custom build (some business mobos do have legacy PCI still), but I'd rather have a service contract for the thing and it not be me on the hook. 
 I've thought about a riser/adapter, but I'd rather go with a dedicated PCI port if I can.

Apparently he's been doing it for weeks because the guy who was doing it before him (at least that guy wasn't an admin) hasn't been there.So instead of asking us how to get these users logged into a laptop with access to what they needed, he figured why bother? Just log them in as himself and they can access whatever they need.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 since starting networking, I was looking for a tool to create a interactive network diagram.
 Basically the "main goal" is, to have a interactive world map with all network locations and datacenter (including the connections to each other). What I mean by interactive is, that you can hover over a country or location and see the most important information as well as being able to "drill down" by double clicking it.
 I know it is a lot, but and I tried several solutions over the years and found not a single one to create such a "diagram"
 - Visio - Great for detailed Branch Network documentations, but not intereactive
 - Miro - Interactive and easy to use for "quick and dirty" schematics
 - draw.io - same as Miro
 - powerpoint - Interactive but not really meant for network diagrams
 - lucidcharts - same as visio
 - NetBrain - expensive, kinda hard to master and not "easy to use"
 - Any other SDN tool (solarwinds, n-map, ...) same as netbrain
 - even tried some tools for scientific network maps - They basically do what I need but just to a certain degree
 - .....
 As you might notice I've tried a lot and might even have missed some things i tested in the past.
 Maybe one of you big brains out there has something in mind or created something similar in the past.
 I am looking forward for any tips, hints and suggestions :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What are the reasons to replace/upgrade an ONT? Is it just to deliver faster speeds? Can an ISP install a 10G ONT and limit the port speed to whatever the subscriber is paying for 1G, 2.5G etc. That way the subscriber would have an ONT that’s future proof should the subscriber choose to upgrade to faster speeds?
 Is there any other reason to replace/upgrade an ONT other than a failure or physical speed limit of the ethernet port?
 How long does an ONT typical last?
 Thanks!

 I'm looking for a 1U switch for a datacenter rack with the following requirements.
  
2 x SFP+ or faster fibre for link to meet-me-room
 24 x 1G RJ45
 Managed L2 switch
 Redundant power supply
 Doesn't block with various frame sizes at 60%+ saturation
 Budget max ~2k Euro
 Max 200W power usage (No PoE needed)
  
I have looked into Mikrotik CRS354-48G-4S+2Q+RM, but from the Servethehome performance review mentioned one should buy a different switch if used at higher saturation. Also some comments about Ubiquiti USW-EnterpriseXG-24 and FS S5850-24XMG, though these are 10G L3 switches, so much more than required for my use case. So should be OK?
 Any model or brand you would recommend instead? I saw HP Aruba instant on, but they don't have a redundant PSU except for the CX line. Arista or Brocade?
 Thanks,Matt

 All my life i tried to mantain my network, cables and devices all working under the same pattern (usually 568A) and only when needed to,use a crossover cable. In my current adventure, i have little resources and a doubt.
 I have in my hands:
 A rack filled with T568B "Male" Rj-45 cat5e cables.
 A nice furukawa patch-panel.
 Tons of T568A cat5e patch cords of the size i need.
 My doubt: If i crimp the male cables INTO the (female) patch panel at the same pattern as the other end, that is, T568B, then connect the patch cable to my switch through the T568A patch cord... Would i be limiting the internet to 100mb or would it still distribute GBe? Would it even work properly?
 If that wouldn't work... Any suggestions on working it around? would crimping the cables into the patch panel as T568A - same as patch cord - even though the other end is 568B, be better?
 Thanks in advance!

 ​
 I have been in IT for 20+ years and this is not my first merger and acquisition, so I know it can be done the correct way. The owners of the 3000+ people company I work for bought three small companies (around 60 people total) about a month ago and want to merge those companies into one new company (our company will operate independently) with a new domain, Azure tenant, email, etc. IT was not involved in any of the initial discussions until the deal closed. We were told to drop everything and focus on this project but as other teams complain up the chain, the drop everything and focus on the merger goes out the window.
 ​
 This project needs to get done by December 31st and there's no leeway on that time. We talked to some consulting companies and even they say getting it done by end of the year, especially with the US holidays is not possible. We have also been told that if this doesn't get done by end of the year, we may all be looking for new jobs. Oh, did I mention that we still do not have any access to the other companies yet to even start any migration, IT from the other companies are dragging their feet with this information.
 ​
 I guess this is where the rant/frustration comes in, but with a message like that from our management and a timeline that does not seem achievable by companies that dedicate their business to mergers (consultants), I don't get what chance our small and understaffed team of IT people have at getting this done by end of the year. What's the point of doing any work for the remainder of the year... I don't know, just frustrated I guess....Open to hearing other people's thoughts and opinions.

However, whenever it is restarted the internet and all VOIP phones go down for about 3-4 minutes across the entire organization. I have a hunch it may be DNS related, but if the server is left powered off, internet and phones will still restore their connections after a few minutes. This server does not host any DNS/DHCP services and is only running Avigilon server. Any ideas what may be causing this behavior?

 I was enrolling computers in Azure AD, and I forgot to copy over the desktop from the local account.
 Now when I choose "Different Account" at the lockscreen it wont allow me to write in the local account. Even tried with ".\localusername".. So now I just tried to edit on premissions on the local users folder, and toggled on "hidden files", but I cant find the desktop there..
 Anyone who can help me with this?
 :EDIT:
 It was all just a moment of panic. The user had OneDrive sync, but didnt check off desktop, so when I log on the OneDrive the desktop didnt sync. So that's why I kinda paniced. But for some reason there was a file inside the mess in OneDrive that was called desktop. So I managed to recover it from there.

This is very weird , it works correcly for admins and on non-admin users the initial website is working , but if it changes it does not work , as it goes back to edge

 - Antivirus software Installed / enabled
 - Bitlocker enabled
 - Screensaver set to 15 minutes + Lock workstation
 - Automatic updates enabled
 Is there a script or app that could easily verify all this in 1 go? Powershell? Fairly ignorant about scripting in general. If I had to do more than 50 computers, my first thought would be to hire someone to write a small app that reads the relevant registry settings to then report true or false on each setting.
 Again, these are not company owned machines and have no Active Directory or anything of the sort. Continual monitoring of weather these settings stay as they are in the future is not currently required.
 There may be appetite for a similar script for Mac users, but ... 1 thing at at time.
 I suppose I could aim for a slightly higher level of sophistication, where the app would capture some fingerprints like the date, computer name, and Mac address etc to keep as evidence of compliance.

 We have a web proxy running for web filtering and it uses the user's credentials to authenticate via the Web Filter. But for this to happen the session has to do a HTTP request on a web browser that is using the proxy.
 We use MS Edge as the default browser. 
 Does anyone know of a way that I can automatically do a HTTP request when the user logs in via MS Edge so when they open the browser the session will already be authenticated?
 Problem we have is most sites these days are HTTPS, and for the web filter to authenticate it must be a http site. 
 Any workaround anyone has would be great to hear of.

 I am hoping someone has implemented this before and has it working , so they can tell me what they are using and how it was implemented. 
 Many thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[New sysadmin here,
 My current job is making a redundant NPS server to login to the WIFI.
 The current NPS server also functions as the root CA that enables trust for the clients. Because of a problem with our network, we are unable to chain this CA to a publicly trusted CA. Meaning users need to accept our CA as trusted when first logging into our network.
 My boss said that I should make the new server a root CA as well. However, this would mean devices would also need to accept this new CA as trusted. This could cause confusion amongst users, why I am not keen on the solution.
 My idea is as follows:
  
Copy all NPS settings to the new server.
 Make this new server a subordinate CA, chaining it to the already existing root CA.
  
I have two questions regarding this setup:
  
Will this make it so devices only need to accept a certificate once?
 What happens when the existing (root CA) is down, will the trust in the subordinate CA keep persisting?
  
I am still a bit of a noob when it comes to NPS and certificates, so any help would be appreciated!

 Create 4 new partitions on the unused space of the new disks, create a new raid5 array from them, add the new mdamd array as PV and extend the VG.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm transitioning into IT at 35 after working in education the last 10 years. I consider myself reasonably intelligent and have been working rather successfully towards industry certifications. Now, as many of you rightly point out, certifications don't equal experience. All they serve to do is fill gaps in my theory, such as being unaware of how networking works until studying OSI model, TCP, etc.
 So the question then becomes, how do I learn how to do things right? Many folks on here talk about homelabbing, and I'm slowly but surely spinning up things with Azure credits and Raspberri Pis, but at the end of the day, all of my work relies on internet research. If some yahoo on StackOverflow says to set it up one way or another, there's little I can do to verify that this is a conceptually sound process, because I lack the experience - I don't know what I don't know.
 Of course, many people would next say 'get the experience.' But how can one do that if one does not have the experience to get the job in the first place? That is to say, my goal is working my way into systems administration. In such a job they might want me to produce an effective backup storage solution, but if my knowledge comes from tainted sources, how can I do this? It seems like so, so many organizations are running with these barebones IT teams where there's really limited opportunity to start as a junior admin and learn under them over time.

 I have a client who has 2 machines with an underlying Windows XP OS. Users in the Office put files in the machines through network share. 
 Found out the connection they use is SMBv1, which is a security risk.
 I have been tasked to find a solution for it.
 First of all they can upgrade their system to the latest OS but its going to cost them a lot, which they'd like to avoid. They also like to avoid using USB Sticks and keep walking from the Office to the machines.
 I thought of using a NAS(Network Attached Storage) but I don't think this is going to work because the NAS needs to place files in the machine, which I have no clue how to do that, or is this even possible.
 Second, the machines don't need access to the internet at all. I preferably like to isolate the machines from the internal network, which can be done with a NAS.
 Finally, disable access to the internet on the machines and leave it as it is, which is not secure.
 Any idea's how to solve this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I’m putting together a new UniFi network (I know, it’s not mission critical so that should be fine) for an organization thats around medium size.
 The idea is to put a Dream Machine at the top of the network, connected directly to a UniFi aggregate switch, and then connect that to the rest of the switches in the network.
 The plan is to have two 48 port switches in the same rack as the the aggregate switch and dream machine. The question is, does it make more sense to connect each 48 port in the same “stack” directly to the aggregate switch, or would it be better to daisy chain the two switches. Or does it not matter at all.
 Not really too important but couldn’t find much advice about this online and wanted to try to keep things clean and easy. Thanks for your help!

 I am trying to recreate this paper courtesy of the user that linked his website a while ago. I am just curious how I might go about capturing SNMP queries of an EVE-NG topology in a program. Does EVE-NG offer an API? Can this perhaps be accomplished using HTTP similar to this video? Like the paper, my goal is to model the topology in GraphQL using the LSDB’s of the routers in my topology. Thanks in advance for any guidance.

 We got SNMP working no problem, but we rather avoid that. When the SNMP traffic comes across our diode all the traffic appears to come from it. We would need to modify communication strings to know what came from where which is a no go. We already use WUG, but they only offer bi-directional TCP connections between two servers. 
 For something to work we would need a server on the inside to pass across the diode to the outside with one-way TCP communication or UDP.

My title is “IT Director” but that seems little grandiose for what I do. But I do it all… inventory, imaging, network, budgeting/purchasing, monitoring, security, planning, pulling cable, cameras, repairs, Google admin, A/V, backups… The only thing I don’t do is copier repair. 
 I’m planning on moving back to an urban/suburban area soon and I’d like to be a part of a larger IT dept but I don’t know what kind of a role to look for. I have major imposter syndrome and can’t figure out if I’m over or under valuing my abilities. It also seems like a lot has changed in the past decade. Hell, when I started my current position, the building didn’t have full WiFi coverage and most teachers still used overhead projectors with markers. Now every student has a laptop. Ideally, I’d like to stay in education but just something where there’s more than just me and my thoughts all day working together. 
 I’m just wondering if anyone else has made a similar move and what your experience was like. 
 Also, is the “director” title a liability on a resume?

 Do you know what’s out there that can do this?
 I looked at those IP phones but I am assuming that dialing and picking up is needed.

 We use Android tablets for our WMS in a warehouse-like place. This place has some kind of 1st floor made with a steel structure on top of the ground floor (a lovely location to play with Wifi).
 Tablets have always had issues with Wifi connection dropping.
 In order to improve the situation, we've added somes more APs, changed channels. It did help a bit but issues haven't disappeared.
 Recently, we tested some new tablets (for other reasons), and these one's had less issues when roaming.
 After some more research i've heard about Rate settings and decided to give it a shot and made a great mistake : pushing the changes to prod before even testing...
 The major changes were made by our service provider after i asked what they thought of it.
 After a ton of user complaints (tablets were almost always dis/re-connecting), i rolled back to the previous rates settings (had screenshot of it). Even though situation has improved, it is still worse than before the changes.
 I've switched back to 2.4GHz only the APs on the warehouse side, rates are the same as before.
 All tablets models are impacted : CrossCall T4 (Android 10), Samsung A8 and S6 lite (Android 12), our APs are exclusively Aerohive ap130.
 Now my back is against the wall as i don't see what could be causing this... 
 Any help is welcome

I tested this by modifying my host file for the SQL servers hostname to point to 127.0.0.2 and I could still log into the frontend of the app and pull up data. Next I set the Windows Firewall to block all outgoing connection to the SQL servers IP address and I couldn't log into the app.
 I want to migrate the backend database to a modern SQL server (and test the frontend client to ensure it still works) but other than installing a second vNIC on the new SQL server with the old servers IP address (which is an option), is there a way to modify the frontend?
 I'm not a programmer. I think it was created in Studio for NET 2004. 
 Edit: I just opened a login.vb file and found a reference to the server's IP address. If I change it...how do I...compile the application? Seriously I know nothing. Ideally this would point to a server name so I can create a DNS entry.

 I feel like I could create a better user experience in general for Google/MSFT/Anything in the future that uses QUIC, by allowing UDP/443 outbound indiscriminately, but of course from a gut-feeling perspective, it feels inappropriate to do so.
 What have some of you done? Are you specifying destination criteria / keeping up with new domains/CIDRs for this or are you allowing it outbound to anything?

 If you ctrl+f this blog for "Deflecting Reflection" it appears you could be DoS'ed, perhaps something to consider.

 Lately, after we proved our ability to design, implement and deliver complete and complex solutions, and we booted some of our competitors who couldn't, we started getting noticed by various vendors who wanted to partner up with us, which is great.
 One of those is Allied Telesis - They have a minuscule, and I do mean EXTREMELY tiny presence in our country as they have only entered our market, but the downside of that is that I have no idea how good or bad their products are, and I'm not going to suggest a product to my client without knowing that it's good and reliable, regardless of how cheap it may be.
 So my question to you is, oh great RNHM <Reddit Networking Hive Mind>, have you any experience with Allied Telesis, and would you recommend them for Access/Edge or Core/Aggregation, Both?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Example Network Topology
 Please see my network topology sketch. How would you join Special System A and Special System B with a common Layer 2 domain? I have a routed network, but these devices must have transparent layer 2 connectivity between them?
 If I have a Cisco 3850, Cisco 9300, and a Cisco 3650 in a triangle of routing, can I use a technology, such as VXLAN to span a VLAN across these? Do these platforms support this?
 What if I have a more complex network? Does each switch in the routing path need to be VXLAN supporting, or only the ingress/egress switches?
 Is there a performance consideration doing this, or should the switches be able to handle this traffic at or near line-speed?
 Is there a better way? I have no experience on VXLAN, outside of reading about it.
 ​
 There are two use-cases for this. One is for the above diagram, where I have a special system that must have layer two connectivity. Furthermore, if this works, there will be more than two endpoints, and I would need to provide a common Layer 2 spanning several locations. The bandwidth requirements are low. <10Mbps
 The second use case is to create a form of hyper segmentation, for security. I'd like to be able to span several VLANs out to certain sites for IOT, guest access, surveillance cameras, etc. All running back to a central firewall, or series of ACLs would control access between the segments. In this network, all the sites are connected by at 1-10 GbE fiber.

We're small, we don't send bulk email, it's just not appropriate for our customer base. We had SPF configured, and that was working well (i.e. we didn't notice it not-working).
 Last week we started getting "550 5.7.1" errors from any emails sent to a google hosted domain.
 I'm going through the advice on Google's support pages and it's all targeted at bulk-senders and so on. We have a 100% "Bad" reputation for our IPs (from November 2) and a "Bad" reputation for the Domain since August. I suspect this is due to some entries in our SPF entry which includes a slightly dodgy hosting company. We use an external ERM tool which is hosted there and I added their IP ranges to the SPF. Since then the email config has changed and it's not required to add their IPs to my SPF.
 On Friday I removed all the SPF records bar the microsoft one and I set up DKIM and DMARC.
 I'm getting green lights on all the DMARC dashboards for our DNS setup. I can see email headers are containing all the good stuff and I am receiving reports from recipient servers with confirmation that my DMARC is good.
 But, we're still not able to send to any google hosted domains. What further steps can I take to heal my domain's reputation, and how can I get some more warning on this in future?

 I would like to change the minimum length from 8 to 10 and the validity from 6 months to 2 years.
 But without 500 tickets at once from people who don't understand the new policy.

 Admin at a small private school, 2 campuses each with about 300 students.
 We've got a Ubiquiti UDM-Pro on each campus, but it seems like we're operating at capacity.
 Ubiquiti recommends up to 40 devices (network devices, not clients) on each UDM pro, and we've got 45 on each.
 This seems to put a strain on the UDM-pros, since the CPU is always operating at 90-100% and the GUI-based portion of the OS frequently crashes, and we have to restart the unifi services via SSH in order to get back in.
 Anyone have any recommendations on how to go about replacing the UDM-pros with something that can handle the load better, and have that recommended 20% headroom?

 Macs are an option but not everyone is familiar with OSx or wants one.
 So I'm going to make a case for Windows Subsystem for Linux probably with Ubuntu. Looks like it is just another app as far as Windows is concerned and can be managed as such. I'm curious if there are any gotchas, security concerns, or things like that I'm over looking.

 I always thought the default IPSEC lifetime was 3600 seconds aka 1 hour.. Now looking at a Cisco Firepower Management Center, the default lifetime under the IPSEC section of a Site-to-Site VPN Tunnel says "Tunnel Duration: 28800 Seconds" 
 Google shows mixed results, some people say the default timer on ASA, and IOS Routers are 3600, while others say it's the same as on the FMC.. 
 Does anyone know why the default IPSEC Lifetime is 28800 and not 3600 and whether different Cisco products have different default lifetimes? And can you get the IPSEC Tunnel up if both ends have different lifetimes? I know Phase 1 (ISAKMP) can negotiate the tunnel with lifetime mismatch, in that case, the lowest lifetime is used, but is it the same for IPSEC?

There is, however, a recurring problem amongst the teaching staff, where they for some reason can't for the life of them understand why they would have to turn on projectors, or press Windows+P to get the projected display to cooperate...
 So my question here is:
 Do any of you guys have any smart solutions for automating these kinds of minor annoyances? I have tried making some flows in PowerAutomate at home, just to get to know more about this type of thing, and I'm also well versed in Python.
 Any and all suggestions are welcome :)

 we're having a standard setup:
  
syncing AD with AAD Connect to the cloud
 Exchange Hybrid with Exchange 2016
  
We're having a subset of users, who are external suppliers and have their external SMTP adresses added to their AD account, as an Exchange contact object; they don't have a mailbox.
 Background for this is, that we have Apps like Jira and Confluence, where those suppliers should receive updates for Tickes/Sites on their primary work address. Those apps source the SMTP Adress from the AD mail property. I really don't like this setup, but that's something grown.
 However, this is making some trouble with syncing to the cloud, since those SMTP adresses are already registerd with the tenant of the supplier, which makes absolutely sense. But we need those accounts synced to AAD, because we're using AAD as Identity Provider (IdP) for several apps.
 Qeustion to the community?
 How have you solved a challenge like this?
 From my point (Exchage/AD) I can only imagine a solution with Exchange mailboxes for those users with a forwarding to their primary work address. But thils will cost a license in the future, when we move those mailboxes to Exchange Online. That's something I want to avoid.
 My preferred solution would be, that such users can set a notification address in the application. But I don't know if this possible.
 Thanks for helping!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are converting terminated user accounts to Shared Mailbox to retain their emails for regulatory purposes. Now we would like to utilise Inactive Mailbox instead.
 We are running Hybrid Exchange, so to my knowledge to create an inactive mailbox, this is the process:
  
Move the user account to an OU that is not synced to Azure AD while the account is licensed in O365.
 This will cause the account to be deleted in Azure AD while licensed. The license then goes back into the pool and the mailbox is converted to inactive mailbox.
 We can then disable the user account in On-Prem AD and then delete it later on.
  
Retention Policy has been setup in Microsoft Purview to retain items indefinitely.
 My questions are:
  
If you remove the license then delete/unsync the account from Azure AD, will it still create inactive mailbox?
 We used to convert user accounts to shared mailboxes so we have disabled users objects in our Active Directory. If we delete these disabled users or unsync the disabled objects from Azure AD, will the shared mailboxes become inactive mailbox or will it purge the Shared Mailbox instead?

Students like to collaborate using large LCDs (or even two where there's space for us to provide) but we want to get rid of the PCs and let them use the laptops they're always carrying with them.
 We want to pilot this in one of our labs, replacing 12 workstations with hot desks. But we'll need hard data to compare with usage of traditional workstations to present to management, otherwise the pilot is pointless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A week ago our ERP had some massive issues, such issues that we had to spin up a new oracle database server to move it to due to bad disks on one of our nodes.
 For convince I put up a new server on last Sunday, and the disks were iscsi mounted from our NAS.
 NAS is running TRUENAS SCALE and has a hardware uptime of 200 days which is when we installed it in our colo.
 Scheduled to replace disks in the old node Wednesday, and then to move the oracle server back to said node Sunday, meaning today.
 Yesterday, Saturday, at 09.45 the NAS PSU just flat out died. The entire thing (It's a redundant one with two separate power connections) just poof.
 And since it was only for one week, guess who didn't make the iscsi connection redundant and make it also live on another of our TRUENAS instances?
 Yup me. The proud moron that had to spend Saturday to call colo tech to let me in, grab the NAS, drive in to the office and replace the psu, so we could power the NAS back on and get our ERP up.
 Even if it's temporary, do it right from the get go. Don't be a fucking idiot like I am.
 Anyway, just finished migrating the oracle back to it's old node with new disks. Time to walk my dog.

From a pure networking standpoint, how many of you could say that moving to ACI was a positive move for both you and/or the organization? From an employment/resume perspective, is it worth learning about, OR - is it eventually going to fade into a different solution/go away? I ask because a lot of posts show problems with the platform/solution, and I wonder about the long term viability of the product. I think the firepower/asa branding has suffered over the past years because of issues with firepower, and I wonder if the same will happen to ACI, or has already happened? Maybe other vendors are already have way better solutions? I'm just not aware of the solution, and how it is currently/ and will be standing against its competitors long term.... 
 Any feedback is valued.

 How do I make the time between the controller and nodes consistent as small propagation delays are not a problem but something like the system clock may cause issues.
 Would it work to use a countdown instead of specifying a specific time?

 This is terrible advice, please stop giving it.
 As a consultant they're opening themselves up personally to liability and lawsuits by their former company. Especially if they were treated poorly when they worked there, the company isn't going to think twice about it.
 Professional consultants carry liability insurance and have a company or LLC shielding their personal assets from any litigation.
 Making a bit of quick money and screwing your former company isn't worth the risk of losing all you have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are there any known PoE issues with the HP ProCurve 2910al-24G-PoE+ (J9146A)?
 For several months, I've had 5 Reolink PoE cameras connected to a refurbished 2910al-24G-PoE+, and all of them went offline over the past couple weeks. The switch currently says it is delivering 3-4W PoE to all cameras, but the port lights only turn on for 1-2. In all cases, neither IP or link-layer pings can reach them.
 The switch is also delivering PoE to two Wifi APs and an unmanaged PoE-in 5-port switch. These three things have continued to function fine, with the Wifi APs being online even longer than the cameras.
 Also, the cables have been tested and verified. They are shielded CAT6 with solid 23 AWG copper wire. Should hold up just fine.
 Back to the cameras, I can't seem to get the online. There are 4 different models, all from Reolink, and only the oldest one (out of support) lights up a network port. I've also tried them on a ProCurve 2520-8 (J9137A), and it's the nearly the same problem, except that one old camera gets CRC/alignment errors showing up in the switch logs for it's port. Doesn't matter which port I connect it to.
 The only explanation I can think of, and it doesn't make complete sense to me, is that somehow a power outage bricked the PoE Reolink cameras, but not the other PoE devices, and not the PoE switch itself. Perhaps Reolink PoE products are less resilient? Is that plausible?

 This is a completely private Switched network for now with no routers available. 
 I need to establish management access to only these 10 switches, from an existing Server having an address of 192.168.0.100/24 at Site (B). 
 (The switch management addresses I want to manage at site (A) are in sequence - 172.16.1.100 to 172.16.1.109).
 My plan was to use a new NIC available at the server with the address 172.16.1.99 and /28 mask, together with a static route in the server pointing to this NIC as the gateway for the /28 network. 
 Subnet mask of the 10 switches at Site (A) would be changed to /28 and a Gateway address of 172.16.1.99 would be added to them as well. 
 My feeling is this isn’t a clean solution, but since I’m not allowed to change the addresses of the switches at site (A), this is the only way I could think of doing it. Does it make sense at all?

I configured login local for all vty lines and console, but now I’m afraid to configure aaa with Duo.

Experienced people, what should I do?

 Signal metrics both LTE and 5G (of course 5G differs with how it measures SINR for example): RSSI RSRQ RSRP SINR
 Example: running a speed test on the cellular router may show great throughput, decent latency/jitter, but the SINR is poor and fluctuating heavily (up and down vs a solid line). This then seems to result in a bad user experience.
 Teams seem more interested in the speed test results vs breaking down the signal metrics into usable user experience values.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So a week ago Friday I gave my two weeks notice after finding a new, better position. I decided to leave this job due to being the only on site IT resource, which required 7 day weeks with 10 hours on site and the rest on-call from Black Friday through New Years Eve without receiving any extra pay during those times. In addition this company treats IT needs with extremely low priority until an outage stops production, and kept moving my office anytime someone decided they wanted that space (currently I am in a mice-infested storage closet). 
 I found out late last week that they will not be able to hire a replacement for me until after the new year aside from a weekend temp that has almost no IT experience (weekday needs will be covered remotely by the already-stretched-thin corporate office). This is likely to mean outages that will cause them to miss SLAs and put an already threatened facility perilously close to being shut down. 
 Should I feel guilty about this? I’m getting lots of guilt trips but find myself not really giving a crap. 
 My wife suggested offering to do consultant work for them on my off hours, but called me an asshole for saying that I wouldn’t even think about it for less than $250 an hour.
 Edit: For those questioning if the office moves were real, here are some photos (censored so I don’t dox myself): https://imgur.com/a/CnPwoiu/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our company has a large presence in Asia and the local leadership would like to donate our older laptops to charities focused on underprivileged youths. We have stacks of 3yr old Lenovo Carbon X1s which are still great devices for standard workloads.
 As an IT manager, I want to support this but this brings up two concerns from my perspective:
  
securely removing company data from the devices
 reimaging with a usable copy of Windows
  
We were thinking Blancco for the data wipe. Anyone use this or have alternate suggestions?
 Also, is anyone aware of free educational or charity licensing from Microsoft? Not sure how to provide a legally licensed copy of Win10 on these devices as they will no longer run our corporate image.
 Any thoughts or advice?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I am looking to wire my Small Business with 10GBe (Future proof) and need PoE for roughly 7 cameras and 7 Wi-Fi Access Points). L3 is required for security and Vlan routing. I was thinking to go Unifi which I have experience with, but then stumbled on this FS S5850-24XMG-U Switch. This switch has 24 copper PoE++ ports and is L3.
 The Unifi switches would cost nearly as much and require several switches, where this looks to be all in one and maybe a better option.
 However, I do not have any experience with FS and there are no spec sheets available for this. I hope a few people here have some experience with this switch.
  
 How loud is it compared to Unifi Switches?
 
 Does it offer a web based GUI management or is all done via CLI (I have no CLI experience)?
  Would there be any other options or what would you recommend for my use case (12 - 14 POE devices, 5 additional rooms, 10GB, NAS and 2 PCs with Wired connections, VLANS and PFSense firewall).

 It seems fairly quiet on here around Kerberos issues and I'm not sure if that's because people have installed the Nov patch and it's fine, or installed the Nov patch and the OOB patch and it's fine, or if everyone has just backed the hell off patching their DCs and is waiting and hoping it gets sorted out?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote this in another post but figure it should be here.
 When I first got started in IT I was doing data reconciliation work for a major semi conductor industry. The job could have been automated but the guy running that division ( a completely different one ) did not want to agree to take on task of data modeling every issue out to be resolved. 
 I'm very gifted and could do it all in a 2 hours but was groomed to stretch it out because it would mean the next guy had impossible metrics. I had an entire blockbusters worth of movies in my cubical and started coming in at 6 pm working till 2 am to put 8 hours in no one would see was just watching movies for 6 hours. 
 Then I got into a feud with an upstream division that logged everything on Friday at 4pm meaning I couldn't go to the bars to drink with my highschool friends. I complained once and they said they would stop, the next week they slammed me with double so I just signed off and went to the bar. 
 Over 5 million dollars got misplaced because I didn't file the work and it raised holy hell with the C execs. I walked into a strong arm meeting where they tried putting me on the fire and just said "I quit" right away and suddenly they were my best friends and asking me what I'd want from a fulltime job. 
 I said nothing and trained my poor replacement who was an average joe family man and he literally cried as I walked out the door. Felt bad but I had a strong edge on my shoulder since I was kid.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 Our small organization has been archiving media content with our own tape library as a standard practice for some time solely dedicated to our ingest/post-production footage, now we are expanding tape backup writing for other non-critical departments.
 The other departments have had a few TBs backed up in their "unlimited" (Google) cloud storage using our corporate network for a few years, now we need a mechanism to access the content in the cloud and download them to an on-premise storage machine with access to writing to the tape library. Additionally, a checksum validation of the files should be done after writing to tape. 
 So far we expect existing content to be around 12-15TB for the newly included department, the data is expected to grow to maybe 20-25% per year. This content will need to be stored for 8 years for data compliance, and we cannot maintain a single (cloud) copy for their department, hence writing to tape is a hard requirement here. 
 What we have so far as a current setup is, 
  
Mac machine with an in-built storage of maybe 500GB free space currently.
 Access to the cloud content via the desktop application (Google Drive).
 Standalone tape writer with connectivity to the mac via thunderbolt 2 (We don't have the infra for a windows system to connect to standalone tape writer as of now)
 Rewritable LTO-7 Tapes @ 15TB capacity
  
Full disclosure, on our side of IT we have not been looking into the tape writing side until this requirement came up. On a high level, this new project seems to be very tedious as the backup will be of many individual objects, and not sure whether an MD5 checksum for a list of files contained in a folder using the mac terminal is possible, or if somebody can suggest a safe third-party software app. 
 Would like to know what will be the best approach here? Is using the mac as the storage medium the best option also? We don't plan on investing in external hardware.

 I tried using the "-N" switch (no-delay) but it does not resolve the issue. 
 Can someone explain what this means and how to resolve it?
 I am doing a test from a linux box to a windows pc (win 11). Both using the same iperf3 (v3.11) using the "-R" switch (windows pc acting as server, linux acting as client, but the -R reverses the direction so Windows sends to Linux,,that is where this message happens..not in any other direction)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! 
 Back Story is I am somewhat of a novice as it comes to advanced networking.... I have successfully set up OPNSense, a Brocade 6450, and a Ruckus r710 running the latest Unleashed firmware. My main SSID is set up on the AP and is running perfectly fine. My issue is when I got to setup a second SSID for IoT on my r710. 
 Similar to PFSense, I have configured my router with a Vlan, different subnet of 10.0.10.0/24, DHCP server, etc.... The vlan is tagged as 10 on OPNSense. I have done the same on the R710.... I created a guest network, under WLAN set the VLAN to 10. 
 Then on the brocade, I created a vlan and set the port 48 to dual mode so that the tagged vlan 10 and the untagged traffic should be able to flow, but that hasn't worked. I even tried to assign the subnet IP to the tagged vlan 10 with no change. 
 The only thing that has worked so far somewhat is when I set the Vlan tag to 1 in the Guest SSID on the ruckus, but that similar then routes traffic through the untagged rule on the switch which does not achieve the true separation I want for my Vlan. 
 What am I missing here? Any help or direction would be helpful! I have been reading documentation for several hours now, but I am no where closer to solving my problem. Am I missing something simple or am I WAY off base on my understanding of how things needs to flow? Cheers

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The other day I posted about how my virtualization environment collapsed; all the virtual disks were detached from the virtual machines when my storage server went down. Anyway, I only recovered really fast because backing up the virtual machine disks is as simple as creating a snapshot or archive file of the whole disk and tossing it onto a longer term storage. About as easy as backing up a file from your documents IMO.
 How do you do physical drive / server backups? How do you backup hard drives and SSDs without taking them out of the server and cloning? I'm curious because that's one of the bigger empty spots in our documentation.

 I’m the sole IT staff for a multimillion dollar grant program wrapped under a major non-profit. Essentially I have a dotted line to IT, but other than back end things like HR and email, I am responsible for everything else. I’ve been doing it for over a decade so in some sense I don’t have imposter syndrome directly in the role, but at the same time I don’t have deep professional IT experience, and just get by on my own. I leverage a consultant for engineering and largely perform systems administration and support in addition to my others roles. I’m lacking in best practices, oversight and auditing, and ultimately feel like an amateur due to no one requiring anything from me other than “are things working?” 
 I’ve managed fine, overseeing and supporting 9 physical offices, virtual infrastructure and workforce etc, but I feel like I can’t get another job because I’ve largely done everything on my own with little direction and just keeping everything working with the bare minimum. 
 How can I prepare myself for a potential job within an actual IT department with IT professionals that likely have more knowledge than me? And how do I accomplish that without going backwards? I’ve leveraged myself into a senior leadership position within the org beyond just IT, with a heavy emphasis on operational project management and strategic planning (non-IT). 
 Ultimately I don’t feel like I have the skills I need to be successful and I don’t want to be where I am forever. I’m a jack of all trades and an expert of none. 
 Has anyone else been in a similar situation that was able to break through and progress? How did you do it?

 This area is completely new to me. Am learning to implement Azure Cloud Kerberos Trust while also deploying certificates via Intune using SCEP to users on AAD joined devices to enable SSO to RDP/RDS over the internet. I'd appreciate any and all guidance that can be offered here.
 The goal here is to allow seamless access via RDP to legacy applications from AAD joined devices when on-prem and outside of the corporate network. Cloud Kerberos Trust works to take care of on-prem SSO to file shares, printers etc. but I am having a lot of trouble with the RDP side.

 On speedtest I noticed that when I run the download latency it is a normal 20-30, however when its checking for upload speeds, the latency is between 125-1250. Massive spikes happen which is in line with what I am seeing when gaming. I had my father in law test his upload latency just down the street and his upload and download match.
 So I am wondering what could be the cause of the spikes? I haven't added any new devices that would cause more bandwidth to be used. Any help would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we manage sites along the retail/hospitality line that have guest wifi. We normally see maybe 1-2 DDOS attacks per year. We do not host any domains, or any services for that matter, that would allow someone to find out the IP's of the sites remotely. Except for a select few, none of the IP's are SWIP'd in arin either.
 So that leads me to be believe someone on the guest wifi at these sites does something to piss someone off on the internet, or its a random/driveby/typo. Typically they are short lived, single incident or maybe two within an evening/day.
 Its almost always in 1hr or 2 hour intervals, which leads me to believe its a DDOS for hire type thing. Always volumetric, so dns/udp/icmp reflection/fragmentation. So since its volumetric and these sites dont have bgp, there isnt anything we can do from our end.
 Most providers arent that helpful, because they want you to pay for their DDOS protection service, which is normally at least 2x+ the MRC of the actual internet service itself.
 Dealing with one now that is lumen/centurylink. Had an event Monday evening, then again last night (didnt notice this as it was 12am) and now this evening again. We stopped using the IP they were hitting, changed the NAT pool to a new IP, but they are still hitting the old IP. To their credit they did do some filtering Monday, but said it was a one time thing and we needed to talk to our account rep. Looking at the bandwidth graph on the lumen portal, looks like it starts out at over 1gbps, but then settles in around 700-800mbps, and we only have 500mbps at the site. Im inclined to just go to 1gbps if im going to throw money at something, but they could just throw more DDOS at it at that point.
 Anyone have any thoughts on this other than it sucks? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote this in another post about a sysadmin having to fire someone for accessing a system they shouldn't have. The sysadmin I worked for had a red flag come up and had to fire someone and was torn up because the guy was a genius and it was right before Christmas holiday break. We drank heavily about it. Then after we came back to the office he had to clean out the guys office and put it into a box and discovered the biggest pile of pornography known to man he had created on thousands of CDs, disks, zip drives. They found the guy had written macros completely automating his job and spent 100% of his time collecting, indexing and catologing porn for absolutely no reason. 
 If I recall right ( I was drunk when told so could be wrong ) the company had to call the police incase anything illegal was on the disks but it was so much they didn't have the time/budget to go through it all. They tried speaking with the guy but he had moved out of state when his building access got locked. 
 In the end the sysadmin got the full fury of the company for not knowing what was going on and the poor admin spent 2-3 months 7 days a week working to create and implement new security processes and traveling to every branch to install them.
 The guy was only caught because one of our female coworkers had been in the adult industry briefly when she was younger and he somehow recognized her ( they said he had a photographic memory ) and accessed the HR database on her home addresse which was monitored by law.
 I will say this for the company. They put the sysadmin through 3 months of hell but once he finished they gave him a promotion and paid vaca.
 Edit: Because people are saying he stalked her. The sysadmin was able to speak with him once via his mother and the guy said he wasn't trying to stalk her only to put her address into the index he made. He was brilliant but OCD about data. That's what made him good at his job.

 My understanding is that the radio waves can reach the router out of order due to multi propagation where radio waves can take different paths of different lengths due to reflecting off of objects (which are potentially moving). 
 Also, can someone confirm my understanding is right that only a single device communicates with an access point at a time because of CDMA/CA. This allows the access point to know which device is sending it signals right? I realize in the newer 802.11 ax, it can split a channel into subsections and interpret signals from multiple devices at the same time so does it need CDMA/CA?
 Thanks for the help.

 When i go to my account settings in office...the program correctly states that its not activated.
 So, I am noticing that Microsoft office launches....i am able to open a word document and edit it. I can save the edited version on my hard drive. All this... even though I have not activated MS office.
 Excuse my ignorance but i find this unusual that I am able to use the program without activating it. Is this like a trial run where the Office program stops working at some point if you do not activate it?

 https://catalog.update.microsoft.com/ https://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/Home.aspx 
 It's not working on a brand new Server 2022 WSUS server. The page loads, but does not load the way it needs to to import into WSUS. The ActiveX control won't load. 
 Why is it still relying on ActiveX at this point as IE is being retired and not included in Server 2022?
 Either you get an error stating an addon failed to load or no prompt at all and it just doesn't work.
 People in the comments there stating it used to work and then stopped working and nobody is posting a new solution.
 Does anyone have a new fix to make this work? Different URLs to add?
 I used a workaround of installing the WSUS console on an older server that still has full IE11 and imported the update from there. I shouldn't need to do that and eventually those servers will be retired and that will no longer be an option.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I recently started working for a decently large company with multiple locations that does absolutely 0 auditing/logging for our Windows PC's. So I got approval from the IT manager to audit all login/logoff/login failure activity and put it in a database.
 So, I turned the auditing GPO's on, however they feel very junky and the login failure logging doesn't even seem to work. Current issues:
 - Someone logs in and event viewer logs it 4 times and than it says the account logged out 3 times, even though all he did was log in once.- Someone fills in bad passwords, but nothing appears in the event viewer even though the GPO's are turned on for auditing/logging this.
 Is there a way to make it more reliable and work? Or is there a better option that I'm unaware of?
 ​
 Edit: I'm just a junior network and sysadmin, they won't even bother listening to me implementing a paid system since I'm very new to the company. I've been working on making a Powershell script that nitpicks and exports the Event Viewer data to the DB and from there on to a Grafana Dashboard. However the audit GPOs are super unreliable, hence my question.

The ceilings are hard capped with spread out access hatches around the building. From my experience there are typically a couple of fire rated walls to work through as well. This site is also about 2 hours from me so I'm factoring travel as well.
 I'm coming to $9,169, or $458.45 per AP. To me this seems high, but I'm thinking it'll take about 60 man hours. These buildings just always seem to be a pain. This also includes a patch panel, 3000' of Cat6, about 100 drive rings, 40 patch cables, 20 keystones and 20 surface mounts for the keystones. The APs will be owner provided.
 Thoughts on this? Thanks!

 We're doing a migration of all our mailboxes from an on-prem 2016 exchange server to 365 using a hybrid setup.
 we've been using the GUI in the exchange online admin centre to create the batches for the mail migrations but I've found them tediously slow.
 To automate things I've read online that you can use powershell to speed things up.
 Unfortunately I can't seem to find the powershell commands for a hybrid migration, but I've come to the conclusion that using the commands for a staged migration would get the same results of going through the GUI.
 The process I would otherwise go through would be:
 EAC > migrations > select "add batch" > give name - pick "migration to exchange online" > select "remote move migration" > select the hybrid endpoint > insert users or csv > pick target …]]></summary>

 protocol - udp
 external port - 9 
 port - 9
 Source device Ip adress - 192.168.1.255 ???? no idea what this setting is but guide asked for .1.255 ip and i can only put it here
 WAN interface - IOiE_DHCP

 Then. I instal wake on lan app on my phone. I am able to wake on lan now (throug wifi).
 Conect to celular. Input Dns adress (.hopto.org) as hostname, mac adress stays the same.

 Is there software that acts as a proxy or intermediary? For example, fetch emails from Office 365, use 2FA, and our application fetches emails again from this software uses basic authentication.
 is this doable ?

 Currently, we don't require MFA for users who are connecting via the corporate network (we've applied exceptions when users log in when their device is connected to the corporate network). But, now somewhere I read, 'you should require MFA even if you're connecting via the corporate networks'
 After analyzing lots of stuff, most of the answers turned me into a dilemma mode. Having to require multi-factor authentication within corporate networks may be tiresome, but if you don't require MFA while connecting via a corporate network, you won't be able to implement zero trust within your organization.
 What are your opinions on this? What do you do for your Office 365 tenant?

 ​
 I am seeing the policy here with following command (prefix CL for exchange online module)
 get-CLcalendarprocessing $mailbox | select bookinpolicy -expandproperty bookinpolicy
 Results 
 /o=Exchange/ou=ExchangeAdmins(QWFG2115FFFF)/cn=Recipients/cn=ff50d0e3a384487e992077bab9cea5aa-xbxp060
 ​
 But... I do not know what any of this means. I don't know what cn=ff50 etc means. Is this a user? How do I modify this policy to remove all approvers.
 Very confused. I know exchange, but I guess I do not know it this well. Previous job I would change displayname / seating etc for rooms. Adjust crap in room finder, that was about it. I never did anything more.
 ​
 Any help appreciated.

I have built out a new server on 2k19 then 2k22 assuming something got messed up on the initial domain join on the 2k19 box, but same issue across both... FRESH server spinups, joined to domain, adding a role and presented with the following error of "The request to add or remove features on the specified server failed - because requires restart" - I checked event viewer and like this article here: it is exactly correct: https://www.wintips.org/fix-unable-to-add-roles-and-features-on-server-2016-because-the-server-requires-restart/
 ​
 All the way through that article everything goes as planned until step 12... adding Type NT SERVICE\MSSQL$MICROSOFT##WID and click OK. * 
 I get cannot be found / added or whatever it says, I tried doing the "add everyone reboot, and try again" same error.... So - I started back tracking and removed everyone and left the NT SERVICE\ALL SERVICES and am pausing there... Not sure what is going on here. This is a domain joined server and I am just adding a few basic roles. I have tried updating the server all the way to current, and the opposite of just adding servers right out of the gate after domain join. No dice either way. Never seen this before. 
 ​
 Would appreciate any insight here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our organization is having more and more people discover Power Automate to improve their productivity which is great. Problem we’re having though is that there’s a growing amount of “mission critical” tasks being run in individual Power Automate accounts. It’s all well and good if it’s just personal productivity gains like automating some sort of spreadsheet processing but when it’s creating or modifying data that multiple people use we obviously have a problem of not knowing where it originates or what to do when a person vacates. 
 From doing some Googling it seems to be a bit of grey area with Microsoft licensing as to whether it is appropriate to set up what would essentially be a service account managed by IT to run all these Power Automate tasks and allowing users access to it. Has anyone else managed to solve the issue in their environment of centralizing Power Automate?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm looking for advice on configuration for a second ISP uplink on a layer 2 switch with Fortigates in an HA Active/Passive config. The ISP is utilizing VARP on their end. From what I've read, I believe I need to set up a LACP on my HP switch, and then VRRP on my Fortigate. I've included a basic diagram if anyone is willing to look at let me know if I'm on the right track. Devices in blue are managed by me, green by other entities.
 I know that we lack physical switch redundancy from ourselves to our ISP. Unfortunately I can't solve that at this point, but intend to in the future. My understanding is that I would go from LACP to an MLAG at that point.
 Any recommendations on the switching and firewall technologies in use would be appreciated. I can clarify if needed. Diagram link below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every few weeks our DNS servers are getting DDOSed which causes a lot of issues and phone support calls. 
 We are a pretty small operation internally but we do support 10,000 customers. So when things go out we can expect 900+ phone calls. And sometimes it's in the middle of the night and after hours when the senior network engineers are not here. But our solution is basic, it's mostly just rerouting traffic and blocking offending IPs.
 Our DNS servers are old and planned on upgrading soon anyways. We are open to spending money on a solution that just manages itself, though it must be all hardware that we must host ourselves.
 Is there any DNS servers and solutions that is like a gold standard with passively handling these kinds of issues? The less overhead of managing it on the security side the better. Though we still need control over it and add our own DNS entries.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Absolutely no hints, it's just a CSV on a file share that any user (or service account) could write to. No special permissions on the share or files pointing to who/what wrote these files. We have full admin access to all servers, but there are about 600 in total currently online, and the server names don't provide any hints. We know the old admins sometimes set up automated reporting on DCs and CAs, but not in this case. There is no automation documentation, nor descriptions entered on Active Directory objects (not for servers and not for service accounts).
 Where to start?
 Update: A colleague had disconnected the network from an old 2008 server they thought was ready to be decommissioned, but it actually had a shared directory where an old program was writing logs (daily IVR stats). That share had logs being read by a PowerShell scheduled task which filtered the important data and outputted a CSV, which then hopped to another server that had network access to write to the final destination for the admin assistant to get it and provide daily numbers to the CEO, mystery solved and I hate it, but also thanks all, your suggestions were very helpful!

 Why is that? Couldn’t you just consolidate all SSID’s into one, segment these via VLAN’s? And provision them per policy? Or is that solely dependent on what type of infrastructure is implemented? eg: traffic shaping, policy provisioning etc. 
 Like, wouldn’t you want airwaves etc? Just curious on this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this past weekend we migrated servers to a new cloud hosting provider.
 I was able to recreate the application pool in the remote application RDS server. Everyone on laptops can log into the application after I setup their remote app web address to the new web address. They login as usual and works no issue.
 But if they try to connect using the RD app on Android or on a Mac using the Microsoft Remote Desktop it doesn't allow then to connect. Gets stuck at configuring session and then errors out after a minute. This is when they publish the workspace and login to the workspace no problem but when actually opening the application thats when it gets stuck.
 Is there a setting that would be causing the Mac and android users to get locked out?
 It worked previously but when I tried to look at the settings on the old RDS server it can already deleted the collection (which was strange).

I honestly had no intention to look into Linux+, but the only reason I'm now considering is a thread over in r/CompTIA where someone asked if they could avoid working on anything Linux related and they were met with a swift, resounding NO.
 After doing some research about this, it seems like it's true, Linux is the backbone for alot of enterprise systems worldwide.
 Aside from installing Mint and using it for a month or two many years ago because my old laptop kept BSODing on me on Windows and Mint got around that issue, I kinda know nothing about it.
 I don't have a solid plan for what I want to do, because it's kinda difficult to know what you want to do if you don't have the experience nor have you done it before. If I really had to choose it would be Windows Administration or Cyber Security. All I got is the a+ net+ and Sec+, and right now I got interviews set up to transfer to being a cyber analyst.
 I am well aware of the RHSA cert, but just humor me for a second: is Linux+ actually worth it for someone like me that knows almost nothing about Linux?
 If it helps, job listings in my local area don't say Linux+ is required but Linux experience is preferred. Being certified =/= experience but I'd imagine it helps in some way.

So far all the instructions online seem to be either outdated or confusing. Does anyone have a best standard guide to follow with instructions? 
 For example, some instructions online mention to create a VM for the offline root ca, others mention that it should be on a laptop with hyper-v, and finally some suggest baremetal, but I am not sure what type of hardware should I use. Ex: Poweredge r450?
 Also, we are 99% Windows shop, but I am interested in linux and have looked at hashicorp vault and step-ca.
 Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.

 This executive is killing me. Trying to push to moving to sharepoint/onedrive vs a mix of Google Drive, Dropbox, a handful of local file shares that make sense to migrate. Late wednesday night got an email saying, let's also migrate to teams and teams phone by the end of the year. My boss is on vacation so when he gets back I'm asking him to try talk to said executive to push this back. We're a two man IT team for a large company. We're great at our job but we can't make miracles happen. I'm. personally making the argument that I tend to be a perfectionist and I rather have the extra time to make it a good experience for our end users than to roll out something that's half assed. /rant
 That all being said, Bossman and I really need some crash courses for this stuff if we have any hope of making this happen. We're good at learning by doing but I'm sure there's 100 things we need to learn for teams and teams calling as far as migrating and administration goes. 
 Yes I know this isn't everyone's first choice, but our hands will probably be tied for making this happen. Besides, we've been wanting to consolidate a lot of the services we have for easier administration, single sign on, all that jazz.

 I have the back-ups xs 1400u attached to a small networking rack. Average load on the UPS is 70W to 100W so not that heavy. I wanted something that would keep it up at least an hour and this UPS should according to the APC calculator. I only bought it two years ago.
 I had a power outage for the first time today. 40 min for maintenance, and when I checked on the rack about 30 min in it was dead. It performs Self Tests regularly and I ran one manually today in Powerchute and it passed. Could the batteries be failing after two years?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Several years ago, I installed for a client a full highly available RDS farm, and everything work smoothly as far I recall. back to last month, the client has found that when the database is no longer owned by the "regular" SQL server, the farm stop working. So I'm looking for what can cause such a mess, because in the last 4 years, I did'nt touch the farm configuration, but the client did (and the client has changed his IT team twice over the 4 last years).
 For information, it's a 2016 RDS farm with a lot of RDSH, but the main part is the 2 RD Broker, with a database hosted on 2 SQL boxes, with alwaysOn, 2 RD gateways, 2 RD WebAccess and 2 RD licence servers.
 Everything works fine until you manually (or after a reboot) change the replica's owner from the SSMS, then the active broker logs that it cannot contact the database, and everything failed (I waited for more than an hour to be sure, but nothing automatically fixes the mess).
 If I use the cmdlets Get-RDConnectionBrokerHighAvailability, I can see that the database connection is made on the AlwaysOn Listner as expected. The only weird things is that in the registry the database connection is set to one of the SQL servers instead (in the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tssdis\Parameters\DBConnString)
 Anyone can help me troubleshoot this ?

 I was thinking of creating one internally using O365 Sharepoint and automate. Only 4 admins use it, so in theory should not be super complicated or fancy.

 I'm a rather new Sysadmin (3 months) who has more or less worked my way into Powershell and adding automation into our environment. At the current moment I'm pushing out a simple task that restarts our EUDs. The problem is, a hand full of devices are claiming to have completed but returns the code 3221225794. This cannot be a permissions issue as it is run with local system.
 So far I've tried as follows: -Creating a new task: Powershell and cmd.exe both don't work still. -Using a different account: Runs on local admin accounts fine, but due to restrictions cannot use local admin for all tasks.
 We are running Win10 (x64), and all the affected devices are Dell Laptops. Any advice would be greatly appreciated, and feel free to ask for additional clarification!

 NATS are good. I use them all the time.
 Keeping on topic with the video and this subreddit...
 Who actively works within an IPv6 environment? How is it? Is it all that it should be and more? Do you miss NATS? 
 Lay it out here for us.

But for some reason, Teams always opens on a "Personal" account. Using my peronsal email. I do not want that account. I am never going to use Teams for personal things. I don't want to have to switch accounts every time I open Teams. I just want it to open and immediately be on my work account. Is there a way to do this?
 When I log out of my personal it closes the whole application. And when I try to sign back in using my work email it tells me "This email does not exist." Even though I have been using the work account for several weeks now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After installing KB5019966 or later updates on Domain Controllers (DCs), you might experience a memory leak with Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS,exe). Depending on the workload of your DCs and the amount of time since the last restart of the server, LSASS might continually increase memory usage with the up time of your server and the server might become unresponsive or automatically restart. Note: The out-of-band updates for DCs released November 17, 2022 and November 18, 2022 might be affected by this issue.
 Workaround: To mitigate this issue, open Command Prompt as Administrator and use the following command to set the registry key KrbtgtFullPacSignature to 0:
 reg add "HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\services\KDC" -v "KrbtgtFullPacSignature" -d 0 -t REG_DWORD 
 Note: Once this known issue is resolved, you should set KrbtgtFullPacSignature to a higher setting depending on what your environment will allow. It is recommended to enable Enforcement mode as soon as your environment is ready. For more information on this registry key, please see KB5020805: How to manage Kerberos protocol changes related to CVE-2022-37967.
 Next steps: We are working on a resolution and will provide an update in an upcoming release.

 ​
 Hoping someone could shunt me in the right direction here.
 I had a user email to say they couldn't delete a folder into SharePoint blah blah blah. Up until, in my dom admin account, I couldn't either... I keep getting the error "The Resource has changed since the caller last read it; usually an eTag mismatch"
 ​
 I've got to level with myself, I have never seen this error in the years I have been doing 365. I'm an owner of the site itself, so I have full read, write, and execute perms.
 ​
 I've got the user to re-sync the folder up to SharePoint to see if it would merge the two and then able to delete it. No dice. Was thinking I might have to go down the PS route to forcefully rip it off. Has anyone done this before? Has anyone seen this error before?
 ​
 Many thanks

 Thing is, the traffic that needs to be encrypted has the source/destination pair of IPs as the tunnel’s source/destination itself.
 How is this setup working? The crypto ACL is based on “IP”.. from my perspective, the tunnel itself shouldn’t come up.. because the first UDP 500 packet will start looking for a tunnel to traverse which doesn’t exist in the first place.. 
 What am I missing? What is it that is making this setup work?

 We received 500 devices like tablets, and phones. I need to create an list of the name, serial number, manufactur and as an extra additional data like components or memory.
 The devices have no barcode and only written serial number on their backs. I thought there is maybe a way to plugin the device and make a software which collects the data and write it into a list. Not sure, All of it is android so I think I could enable ADB on those and somehow with developer mode could get that data but still thinking of options. Our erasure software won't delete (and catch the data) as they are ALL ROOTED and the software don't allow it....
 Ideas, dear colleagues? 👌

 I was assigned a new task: build a representation of our network architecture.
 The easiest way would be to use Draw.io or Visio but it does not seem very scalable to me as we have a constant growing network.
 I bet there are other tools that can make the job.
 If I am being unclear, I need a scalable tool that displays our routers and their named interconnections on a map. We have a DB of our routers, their links and location so that can be exploited as well. Being able to have multiple layers (core, aggreg and access) and take geolocation into account is a plus.
 Take care!

 From questions I've asked IT team members, Cumulus is considered a "White-box" solution meaning that instead of the hardware coming with the operating system and/or accompanying software already installed you purchase a separate quantity of "bare metal" switches and then load the operating software system on to them(the switches).

 I’m currently trialling WHfB in our tenant and since I’ve made the switch, I’m seeing some authentication errors (below) when trying to use SSO to some Azure enterprise apps and unable to sign in. 
 “Authentication method 'X509, MultiFactor' by which the user authenticated with the service doesn't match requested authentication method 'Password'”
 I believe I understand the issue, however where do I change the authentication method to use password rather than X509 auth? Would I need to raise it with each vendor to amend the SAML settings, or is there an easily configurable setting within the enterprise app/app registration itself to force it to use password?
 Thank you!

 I am swapping out our office network as the previous 3rd party company that was here set up a half-working system. 
 We have Sonicwall in office (firewall + 5 AP) and I was wondering if it would be good idea to swap it out with Fortigate. 
 The reason why I’m working on swapping it out is because the specific AP models that our firewall takes are discontinued. 
 Ruckus was something I wanted but there are also order issues here. The APs and switches won’t arrive for long and I need to fix internet ASAP. It’s super bad. Some areas aren’t covered at all. Even cable internet keeps disconnecting. 
 Fortigate is in stock and available. I can start requisitioning them and fixing office network. 
 I do not have ANY experience with Forti and I do not want to make a rushed decision because of time constraints. 
 Can any of you tell me what your experience with Fortigate has been? Does it support seamless transitions, domain authentication, etc? How reliable are they? 
 Thank you in advance!

 The datacenter is divided in multiple subnets. Now when we do a ping to domain.local on a machine in the datacenter that's not in the same subnet as the DC we get a reply from a random DC in a branchoffice. I checked the logonserver and that's correct.
 I know how DNS round robin and DNS Netmask Ordering work now. But I can seem to figure out how to get a reply from the DC in the other subnet in the datacenter.
 We use all class A networks. To make it simple:
 Datacenter:
 10.1.0.0/23: Where the DC is at.
 10.2.0.0/23: The client where you do the ping to domain.local from.
 Branchoffice 1:
 10.3.0.0/24
 Branchoffice 2:
 10.4.0.0/24
 ​
 Can someone help me in how I can configure this?

 I woke up a few days ago (late in the day because working late) to find that our hypervisors lost connection to the storage server. All of the virtual machines still running without disks basically. The storage server basically died on me while I was asleep at home. After fixing issues with the storage server (some faulty hardware and a failing RAID), I powered back on our hypervisors and started restoring from backups.
 For a minute, I thought we lost all of our data, all of our servers, and were not going to be able to bring anything back online for a few days. But I was able to fix everything wrong with the storage server (since the power issue was due to a PCIe card failing, and did maintainence) and bring back online most of our VMs without issue. The only VM we lost was a test server that was created that night. 
 Although I was able to recover basically everything, I still have decided to improve our backups and retention system. It was a life safer this time but I think we definitely could have better backups. 
 It's things like this that make you not regret doing the extra work for backups and fail safes (even if they might suck to set up at times). Made me definitely feel good about my backup systems and plan in case this kinda thing happens. Now I'm taking what I had before and adding on top of it; since I have an actual reference incident to go off of.

I have only been working full time post-college for almost two years now, and this is my first job straight out of the gate as the sole IT resource on-site for a company of roughly 250 users and growing rapidly.
 I have some assistance from an MSP, someone who I can bounce questions off of and turn to in a pinch. Outside of that, I’m alone. To say it’s been stressful is an understatement. My company expects me on call 24/7 and everyone has my personal cell and abuses it and refuses to use a ticketing system. All that aside, I want to ask for help, as that is the only foreseeable alternative to me up and quitting. While I have been looking for other jobs, I haven’t actually had a talk with my bosses about how I’m feeling. Mainly because I am not the first IT guy in this role, which has always been filled by one person. I don’t want to be seen as “that guy” who can’t handle it like the previous guys did and ask for an extra person, as I feel like that would just make them look down on me. I know that probably seems dumb, that’s just where my head goes. Like I said, at this point getting some help is the only thing that would make me stay for longer. I just don’t know how to approach my bosses and what to even say. Does anyone have any advice or been in a similar situation?
 Thanks for reading.

 I dont have much experience with CA and I was wondering if I install the CA if im able to import the current wireless cert so I wont have to push it out a new cert to everyone?
 Also will installing CA break our wifi or anything else?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Our Catalyst 6509's are due to be replaced next year - we have around 8 of these deployed at different sites which have 1G connections back to our data centers. I've seen a few posts suggesting that Nexus 9K devices should be used to replace the 6509's, there is also a colleague who suggests the same. I was thinking today (when working on a couple of Nexus devices), that they are a bit overkill just for a site? Especially when most of our access switches are still 3560 era.
 ​
 I really do not have much Nexus experience, so I am genuinely interested in what people think and the advantages/disadvantages of them. 
 A colleague and I were speaking today that replacing a C6509 at a site with 2 x Nexus switches in a VPC seems overkill. Especially when there are a maximum of 15 access switches (this is our largest site, some only have 5/6 access switches). We both agreed that a 2/3 stacked 48 port C9300's or equivalent could be a good replacement on the 6509's going forward. They have 10G access and uplink ports and the pair of us agreed that they're easier to set up in terms of HSRP (stacking them will do it). We are also curious to understand the benefits of VPC over standard port-channeling.
 ​
 Sorry for my ignorance on this one, but as I mentioned my Nexus knowledge is poor!
 ​
 Thanks in advance

 ​
 Old IT Admin goes into Retirement, really wanted to finish a Firewall Migration intime (No one else knows the damn Infrastructure). I did setup everything. DNAT's, IP's,Policies, handpainted Toplogie... everything. 
 We had to switch the MX Record for Mail Exchange to onprem Exchange. Maybe you know where this is going. 
 Transfered every VLAN. Policies, NAT, Routing to VPN... worked. I was like yea.
 Admin gets a call. I already knew I fucked up.
 Mails aren't getting through (Prio Nr.1 during Migration)...
 Guess who forget to tell the Admin to let the PTR-Record change to new IP.
 Had to do the entire Walk of shame back to the old firewall and then also realise that I'm on vacation on Friday for 2 Weeks. Means no time to finish intime. 
 Misses didn't understand a think and I'm sitting here. Thinking I'm top notch and didn't think about a ducking DNS record...
 Imposter Sysndom is real and I never felt that before. I doing this for around 4 years.

 Just wanted to share my experience. GG and goodnight

 My current Fortigate's will be EOL next year, they have been great. I couple them with Aryaka SD-WAN for a East Coast to Mid-West site-to-site connection. (Aryaka has been solid as well)
 But, always looking to improve. Need faster... 
 Currently only two locations, redundant 1GIG links at each location. Latency is site to site around ~60ms RT without Arayka. With Aryaka around ~80ms RT 
 The location on the east coat host SQL servers, AD, Print servers, traditional Fileservers. Things are not terrible at the branch location, but you can feel the delay pretty well when accessing. We never actually max out any circuits anywhere. We are only a small/medium size company.
 What could help me out here? A deeper dive into SD-WAN? Silver-Peak? 
 Not sure where to turn....

 Couldn't really say no although we are already so so busy with other jobs. It is a 2 story building with multiple racks on each floors, we are required to identify each port and label them at both ends.
 Any idea how we can do this job in a speedy yet efficient manner?
 Don't really want my technicians to run around from one end to another manually taking out cables which could take forever given the fact each floor has somewhere in between 20+ lan points. 
 Any tips would be highly appreciated.

 We had an incident where a users mailbox was compromised and was used to send out phising links. M365 Explorer shows us the ammount of e-mails sent, but can't seem to find a list of users who actually clicked on the URL.
 Anybody know how to generate such a list in M365 or through powershell?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 ​
 I'm currently having the issue that sometimes when I try to logon to a server via remotedesktop the connection fails with "the logon attempt failed".
 Yesterday someone else had that issue, while I was able to connect to those servers.
 The problem doesn't always occur. It seemingly happens randomly and also fixes itself after some time passed like 1 to 2 hours.
 While the issue persists on one workstation from a different workstation you might be able to connect with the same login credentials at that time.
 ​
 It doesn't affect a single server and also happens with different operating systems of those servers (Windows Server 2008r2, Windows Server 2019) two of the currently affected servers are DC's. The affected DCs are Windows Server 2008r2 and the other 2 DCs that are not affected are Windows Server 2019. There are also other servers than DCs that are affected.
 - Trying to remote with the server IP adress didn't work directly but now it's working and the connection with the hostname still isn't working
 - The servername is beeing resolved correctly.
 - The affected servers are Pingable while the issue persists.
 - Last Windows Updates of those Servers were in October 
 Did anyone else have similar problems/knows what might be the issue here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking for views on this and keep seeing conflicting points. Some say everything should be virtual, others suggest a physical DC.
 The issue we're trying to address is at present all our DCs are virtual - all our hypervisors are Hyper-V
 We recently did a full shutdown to carry out some electrical work. What we realized is that if the DCs didn't come backup automatically for whatever reason with the hypervisor then we wouldn't be able to authenticate with domain credentials onto the Hyper-V host.
 Alternatively I guess we could use local admin, but we use LAPs so again we need domain access to pull up the local admin password.
 As a bonus question - we have a Veeam backup solution which is also currently virtualised. Again my question is should this be physical? It's not using tapes, just backing up to separate SANs.
 If we couldn't get into our virtual environment, we wouldn't be able to do anything with our Veeam backups? We'd have to quickly build a Veeam server to access and restore our backups? Am i missing something

 Does it make a difference how to call the exe-file (&, Invoke-Expression, Invoke-Item, start-process)? Or is HP just to stupid to offer a tool which is able to give back a returncode to my script?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Had an email through this am about a forced upgrade of all our MFPs from Konica Minolta (a brand which I think are pretty good) to Sharp and Lexmark.
 I was hoping others may be able to share their wisdom with these two brands, as I've never used them before and don't want us to be thrust into agreeing for a product that has well-known issues or quirks. 
 The specific models are 
  
Sharp BP70M75 (replacing a Konica Minolta Bizhub 654)
 Sharp MXB456W (replacing a Konica Minolta Bizhub 4020)
 Sharp BP50C26 (replacing a Konica Minolta C287)
 Lexmark C4342 (replacing a Konica Minolta C3100P)
  
The fact that we're having two brands replace one, doesn't sit well with me, but maybe this is standard practice. 
 I'd be interested to hear your thoughts, as I've always rated Konica Minolta highly (perhaps wrongly so??)

 Unfortunately, when googling for "definitive DNS data" I can only find standard articles describing the different DNS entries and nothing about the security relevant topic. For me this whole field around DNS a bit confusing and would be very grateful for some help or resources regarding this topic.
 I hope this is the right community for this question.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I am new with MLAG and I want to interconnect 2 DC's connected with dark fiber. A pair of DC switches in each DC
 Ideally the routing would be local, as close to the source as possible. So if a host connected to DC2 wants to communicate with a host connected to DC2 on different VLANs, it would not be necessary for the traffic to travel to DC1 and back to be routed.
 Is this possible with MLAG? Do I need VRRP over MLAG? Or do I need EVPN-VXLAN?
 Thanks

 Scenario: 200 workers (mostly programmers), hybrid work, vpn.
 50% workers with client machines (win) 49% workers with office(domain) machines (win) 1% workers with office(domain) Linux
 Workers with client machines need access to internet and at least one local server
 The other workers like other company, some administration, programmers, etc and have his own servers and shared resources. this is what i am interested in isolating
 My first and only idea was try implement something wih packetfence and radius, for begin, create a VLAN for authenticate users and the isolate ass guest users with only internet use (no portal/no auth).
 The problem if activate 802.1x in the switchs , desk assignments are not fixed, and I did not get nor do I know if it is possible to validate an incorrect identification attempt as guest (user with client machine) or simple bypass users outside the domain and accept the radius query as a guest. Packetfence/Radius always block.
 Any ideas for the easiest way, dynamic, and without very specific and expensive software/hardware to implement some security?
 The switchs in this network even above they are bad (dlink), there is one that accept mac auth, the rest only 802.x / port based, they buy two years ago, and they are not about to change them

 With a licensed Eve-ng Pro, what happens after 1 year and the pro license expires? Will the installation automatically switch to the community features?
  
Answers to these questions will help me decide if I should start with the pro version. If I start with community, will need to reinstall to the Pro when ready for license purchase. 
 Thanks in advance for your help!

 Tried using wmic to do it but that doesn't seem to recognize the "Dell Optimizer Service" part and leaves that installed.
 Edit: Correction, when I use the full path to the programs file folder I get the error "Windows Service Start Failure" saying that a Windows service must first be installed using installutl.exe and then started with the ServerExplorer or the net start command.

 And as I listened how very preventably and with constant complaints to managment somebody ended falling in boiling acid, I couldn't help but be thankful. I worked in a lot of poorly configured environments, poor security, poor performance, poor management... Who hasn't. And I have also fucked up a few times. Who hasn't. 
 But NOBODY IS GOING TO DIE if I don't convince management to fix a big issue, nobody is going to die if I fuck. Productivity will be lost, Data may be lost. You may get screamed at, you may be fired, your company may even go under. But nobody is going to be seriously injured. And I think that is worth keeping in mind when the pressure gets to you.

I know for a fact that they are still there pretty much in their full form because trial versions of Data Recovery software previewed them. However, I'd rather the free command line alternative.
 I've heard of people recommending to back-up a drive as an image first before doing data recovery, but it seems they are usually referring to failing drives. Do I need to back up my external HDD as an image before running such data recovery if I'm just looking for deleted files and the drive is actually working fine?

 While I'm trying to get them to provide resources I also want to manage their non-value added expenses when people aren't working. I don't mind paying for meeting coordination and resource management when I see actual work and on really large projects I am not surprised by 5-10% but at this point, it feels like I am just paying them to send me the bill for the few hours I actually get and the e-mails apologizing that they don't have resources to do the job.

 we need to buy a couple of them
 they lock from the sides, from where you put in you patch cable, the plate's hole is not standard size, as they are almost square. 
 thanks for any

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently got "promoted" at my company but actually got screwed over and left as the only IT person for a business unit that was sold. Was doing desktop support, junior administration tasks. However at once I was left in charge of everything, management, budgets, helpdesk, desktop support, server admin, network admin/engineer, network security, citrix, vmware, O365 admin, you name it. 
 I was only given a small raise but not what people that are responsible for this make. Worst thing is that it's not actually these advanced tasks killing me but the day to day helpdesk/desktop support. The company is fairly large for a one person plus on insane embarking of growing fast - so lots of changes, openings, purchases of small companies, onboardings non-stop. Management is abusive as well.
 People are quitting left and right this place. Think of what the media says of twitter, but not twitter. 
 in any case, they won't hire anyone else, in fact I can barely make purchases. 
 I've figured is a losing battle and is mentally breaking me. I've spent about past 2 or 3 months working 12 hour days, stressed, working weekends, have pulled about 3 all nighters and work 12 hours next day, no extra pay, etc.
 I was doing it because it was the chance of a lifetime for me to get out of "desktop support", but have only been able to get my feet wet in everything of the advanced items. So far I have been successful but the low wage along with the abuse and the work overload have made me decide I can't do it anymore.
 ​
 However I feel stuck, I don't want to go back to desktop support as that will lower my wage more, but I can't get a full system administration, network administration role as I'm no expert in these and I don't know what to do. Have been applying to jobs and have an interview next week, but any advice is appreciated, I'm truly in a desperate situation.

 existing subnet gateway is 35.1
 when expanding the subnet to a /23 the new subnet begins at 34.0-35.254
 Question of course is, can the gateway stay in place as 35.1 even though it's smack dab in the middle of the new subnet? I know it's an ugly sight, but technically speaking, will it cause any issues?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
 Want to get your thoughts on datacenter switches, specifically between Aruba and Dell. Specifically I am looking at the Dell 4128 vs 6300M models.
 Dell is priced very well with 5 years support and prodeploy included. Everything looks great with them and all my servers and SANs are Dell. Some have said some negative things about Dell switches on this forum, weird CLI, difficult to work with, but those comments seem to be related more to OS9/Force10 and not OS10.
 On the other hand, all my access switches are Aruba and they have been flawless. Ive heard a lot of good things about Aruba and they were rated very well in the 2021 gartner report for wired and wireless LAN. Dell doesn't even seem to rank on this report. The Aruba quote is around 1.7x the price of the Dell quote. 
 I'm running Cisco currently. They aren't a contender because they absolutely blew the doors off with their price. I'm talking 5 times the others. I almost laughed at our MSP on the call. 
 Are any of you running Dell datacenter switches, specifically with OS10? Anyone running Aruba? How has it been for you?

 Please keep in mind I'm a complete novice to networking and excrutiatingly dumbed down explanations are very much welcomed.
 I see a global unicast address has the value 2000::/3 and I'm really struggling to understand how the slash notation correlates to the range of addresses it somehow represents.
 I don't think it helps because all the explanations I'm seeing speak of subnetting (which I'm familiar with in IPv4) but on the other hand I've got a CCNA instructor telling me subnetting doesn't exist within IPv6? 
 Help is very much appreciated as this is the first topic I've come across where I've really not been able to find the answer on my own. Thanks in advance.

 Does anyone know a way to test PPPoE without a line?
 For more context, we have a Palo Alto, a cisco switch which we are configuring for a remote site.
 Compared to our other sites, this one is the only one with a PPPoE line and we'd like to somehow do a mock with a laptop and the equipment so hopefully and plug and play job for when we send the kit out.
 We plan to have one of our Palo interfaces be the primary port for this line and want to test in advance.

Workstation A can ping Workstation B by name and it responds with the correct IP. 
 NSLookup for Workstation B while on Workstation A is showing correct info. 
 Workstation A can RDP to other workstations and servers by name without issue. 
 Workstation A can RDP to Workstation B via IP
 Workstation C can RDP to Workstation B by name using same credentials that user on Workstation A is using. 
 Workstation A cannot RDP to Workstation B with other users credentials (that are successfully able to RDP from other workstations) when RDP via IP. 
  
Cleared RDP Connection History following this article. Cleared Windows Credential Manager stored passwords. 
 Not sure if anyone else has run into this recently.
 Edit: 
 Issue seemed to have fixed itself with just time it appears. I followed up with a client from a few days ago that was having this issue and tried connecting via workstation name and it worked. Just tried again with the Workstation A that I was troubleshooting this morning, and it worked again. No reboot was done on anything. As people have suggested it may be related to the Kerberos update.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm relatively new to the linux side of things, I switched my homelab over from mostly windows to almost pure linux to really learn it. I recently started dabbling in ansible and holy hell, it feels like I unlocked a cheat code. I can do things that would normally take me half hour+ to just as long as it takes to type the command out. My whole infra can be updated immediately, and I can make any change I want instantly to as many or as few servers as I want.
 I recently stood zabbix up, and I was able to get snmpd installed, configured, and the firewall ports opened opened on all dozen or so of my vm's by just typing out a playbook. I was so proud of myself when I checked the systems I ran it against and everything was exactly how I had specified in the playbook. I've still a lot to learn about ansible, but I really am kicking myself now for not looking at it sooner. I want to try and look into deploying new vm's with it next and work on automating a lot of tasks like updates, and get a better understanding of grouping devices.
 Learning linux has made me really loathe working with windows at my job, and I hope to one day make the jump to linux administration.

 I am using a DC with WS2012 R2 and after I installed the updates of November, domain users are taking a very long time to login or to log off on the domain PCs. Also, we can not access the shared drives. Sometimes it works when we access them trhough IP, but it does not work anymore with the server name. 
 I installed also the OOB, but no luck. Also I added this reg. but no success. 
 reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\kdc" /v ApplyDefaultDomainPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f 
 I will try to uninstall once again both the updates, but I do not have high hopes.
 Do you guys have an idea? what we can do to fix this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there, I have a hard drive which kinda behaves strange. When I write a new file to it, it seems like it did it okay. After a restart, or a unmap drive letter, map drive letter the file is gone. Sometime files are also looks corrupted, for instance a preview is shown, but I am unable to open it. When I try to copy the files to a new location it often shows errors for files I am able to open. 
 I desperatly need most (if not all) files on this hard drive (of course there is no fking backup, thanks to the prev sysadmin). Also the company won’t pay any money for a hard drive recovery service because some files are sensitive.
 My question is, would it solve my issues if I use a hard drive cloning device (will the files be corrupted even then?) , or shall I try some software like Acronis True Image? Please help me get these files back, my job depends on it.

 What I have seen from other people using a load balancing router to increase their bandwith is that some connections can't split the packages across 2 seperate IPS-to-user lines and others can.
 I was wondering if Parsec does split data when I merge two IPS DSL lines by using a load balancing router to get 100 down and 16 up for the faster upload.

After move operation will I be able to see and access the same fixed volume data on server B? I would like to avoid data copy operation between those servers because those disc will be moved between server permanently. Any feedback appreciated.

 I'm trying to find an answer to what feels like a very simple question. On a 100GBase-SR4 connection (let's say between two switches) if one fibre or one pair fails, what is the behaviour? Is the connection lost or does it simply degrade in performance (eg dropping to 50/25/10Gbps)? I can't find an answer to this anywhere.
 I presume any answer would apply equally to LR4 or copper connections.

 so we have a little problem and I hope the combined wisdom of the sub can help. We plan to put up some iPads with "Guided Access" (see https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/guided-access-ipada16d1374/ipados) in branch locations and a webpage where visitors can give feedback. Network is achieved by a data SIM in the iPad.
 This is all working good, but now we are looking for a way to remotely unlock the devices, update it to the last iOS version and lock it again. 
 We looked at using an MDM like https://jumpcloud.com/ or a remote tool like TeamViewer, but so far we were not successful. There does not seem to be an option in jumpcloud to force an update and the remote tools could only view the screen but you could not interact let alone deactivate guided access and reactivate it. 
 Does anybody have a solution for this kind of problem?

 Current spend on 8 cloud servers per month is around £700 so looking to reduce that if possible.
 The idea is to reduce hosting cost and standardise to docker containers so developer and release process is easier.
 I have some Docker knowledge, but little Docker Swarm/K8s knowledge, I would rather not maintain the infrastructure if possible.
 I'm interested in a setup that would provide some redundancy/resilience for us - none of the servers have high traffic.
 I've looked at self hosted docker swarm, AWS ECS, Vultr, sloppy.io.
 Best solution I have in mind at the moment is to private rent a meaty server from Hetzner and setup docker on there, but this fails to give any redundancy in case that server fails.

 I'm right now researching for a Project which I'm not able to Lab atm. thats why I'm asking here :).
 ​
 Customer came from a Sophos UTM which did Reverse Proxy and Default Gateway. Now he bought a Fortigate with a FortiWeb (Reverse Proxy / WAF)
 ​
 Now we think about the Network Design.
 I thought about the following:
 DNAT from Fortigate to FortiWeb(WAF) into the DMZ
 Then FortiWeb has Default Route on FortiGate which then routes traffic to the Webservers, which are all on a seperate VLAN. 
 ​
 Routing should work, but I have a feeling that SSL Offloading on the FortiWeb doesn't, since Session is being internally route and response comes back from different IP (Webserver). Can anyone confirm or entlighten me ?
 ​
 Thank you very much

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Just wanting to get some of your input about this, a client has asked me a job spec as I've recommended they hire a full time IT presence rather than fully relying on my MSP as there are too many gaps in the infrastructure that would be too expensive to sort via the MSP. 
 They currently don't have any IT staff so it would be a sole role with general support stuff, maintaining infrastructure, going ahead with minor upgrades, creating documentation and standardising some operations. With the MSP dealing with a lot of the larger upgrades, projects, patching, auditing and improvement recommendations.
 The infrastructure is quite small, manageable and not too complex but with a lot of room and time to learn and progress personally. I'm just wondering what job title you would expect to see this as? Part of me thinks it should be IT manager since they'll be the only onsite IT responsibility. On the other hand a lot of it will be dealt with by the MSP and the tasks required wouldn't require a seasoned manager as the MSP will be a fall back, so it seems like a good role for someone somewhat experienced to step up in terms of responsibility.
 Just wondering what your thoughts and points are? I don't want to recommend hiring a SysAdmin and them falling out of depth, being underpaid for the job and unhappy but on the contrary, I don't want to tell my client to overspend on someone who is overqualified and would get bored.

 I manage AS33 which has two uplinks to one provider (ISP A) and one uplink to another provider (ISP B). One of the traffic engineering tasks is to route inbound traffic to my prefix in priority via Router A connected to ISP A.
 It is trivial on Router B connected to ISP A by prepending the as-path. But here's the tricky bit the ISPs have a peer-to-peer connection thus the local preference is lower than their provider-customer routes to me (reference). The local prefence over my route is 90 to their peer 40. I did prepend the path here just to see if it works.
 As far as I understood weight and local preference are evaluated first and the as-path is not taken into account so how do I overcome this? Is there a way to only advertise my network 33.0.0.0/8 when the link to ISP A fails?
 We are using FRR v7.5

Got about 5/6 years experience and I'd describe myself as a cloud engineer although I have the title devops engineer (changing to SRE as its more accurate). I'm thinking about switching jobs and the thought of applying for other jobs is daunting. I've seen Theres technical tests and even though I know random tools like terraform/ansible I wouldnt say I'm fluent in them. What ever it is you need done I can probably get it done. How do you guys beat that imposter feeling syndrome?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdie all,
 it's all very new. Info is a bit scant. And as we are about to buy some more (if we actually have to). I'd be really grateful for some answers if anybody knows. Resellers sometimes don't know/understand everything correctly. Beeing able to fact check them is always a good idea.
 Our reseller is pretty solid, so I doubt they'll do the "get it wrong on purpose to sell more expensive packages"... 
 ​
 So starting October Windows Server can be licensed per virtual core. With a minimum of 8 virtual cores per VM.
 Question 1:
 When they say virtual cores do they really mean virtual "cores" or do they mean virtual threads. Basically can I have a vm with 16 threads assigned and only use a 8 core licenses?
 With physical cores it was actual cores. So our 2x16C server has 32 Cores and we needed 32 core licenses. But could use 64 threads as they are all multithreaded.
 ​
 Question 2:
 Are existing physical core licenses we have now automaticall virtual core licenses as well?
 We have 32 Core licenses. Which allowed us to run 2 windows servers maximum. If they are now virtual core licenses as well. We could theoretically run 4 windows servers with 8 cores each.
 ​
 Question 3:
 All client/device CALs need to be either subscription or with SA. is another prereq from what I gathered.
 Is that referring to windows server CALs only. Or exchange CALs as well. What about RDP CALs?
 Our windows server and exchange CALs have SA so we are good with those. But our RDP CALs do not. Will that preclude us from using these new virtual core licenses for an RDP server?
 ​
 any feedback most appreciated

 We have an extremely restrictive corporate VPN running on our local machines, and I have the okay from my boss to figure out a way around it while we get corporate to ease their policies. 
 I'm running a HTTPS proxy via gluetun on a local VM. Traffic within the VM can communicate with the proxy by using localhost port 1234. From the VM, I have a reverse SSH shell open to my local machine over port 4321, and using that connection, I can SSH back to my VM from the local machine.
 What's the magic SSH incantation I need to allow local machine traffic to tunnel through SSH to my VM and use the gluetun proxy?
 Thanks!

 I'm looking for an alternative to Microsoft Sharepoint as the more I use it, the more I hate it. It's really bad.
 So I'm looking for a paid alternative with multi-language support. Our Intranet pretty much exists of a website with a menu that leads to different categories and pages, a site content database and a good looking homepage.
 The most important thing is the homepage since our employees see it first. In sharepoint, we have a cascade of 5 visual items of the latest news, under that the most important events in the upcoming week(s) and under that some handy links that they can click on.
 So looking for something similar to that, but it doesn't necessarily need to be an interactive workspace where employees can share files, work together, etc. A simple, but functional and good looking Intranet website would do. And yeah, it needs to be multilingual. Any suggestions?
 ​

 When it comes to protecting sensitive or confidential information, there is a lot at stake given that firms were forced to pay an average cost of $3.62 million per data breach in 2017.
 Giving employees unrestricted access to company files via their personal devices (smartphones, tablets, and laptops) is not a sound data security practice, even if it doesn't take a smartphone to compromise crucial records. Unfortunately, that is exactly what takes place when businesses don't set their own BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policy.
 You may be delaying because you fear your staff won't like it, or you may be choosing avoidance over acceptance.
 This video series will break all the Myth around BYOD.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning from the wet, windy, wild UK, fellow Sysadmin's. 
 In creating my YT / LinkedIn content for the M365 world and seeking new solutions to problems, I came across a really handy PowerShell module I'd like to share with you: IntuneBackupAndRestore. 
 Find it on Github here: https://github.com/jseerden/IntuneBackupAndRestore
 It's a module which is written specifically to backup your Intune instance; policies, script contents, settings catalogs, admin templates.. It seems pretty full featured. It hasn't been maintained for over a year, and I haven't yet tested a restore.. But essentially the tool:
 1) Connects to your tenant
 2) Exports all the config into JSON
 3) Organises that into folders
 4) Puts it on any storage you can access
 I've tested the backup in my (very small) tenant, and it seems to work really, really well. 
 There's full documentation for the module in the repo for further reading, just wanted to make people aware of it's existence.
 Remember; MS don't back any of this stuff up. If you made a mistake or some disgruntled, over privileged monkey trashes your environment the day they leave, they won't help you. Unlikely? Yes. Impossible? No. 
 Personally, I'm going to setup some Azure storage and then automate the script to run once a week and export everything there. 
 Hope someone finds this useful. Happy hump day!

A while ago Gmail locked down their services so you can no longer use that feature labeling it a "security update" when they removed it. I moved over to yahoo and it was working up until about 4-6 months ago. They are doing the samething now but lying about it saying feature is disabled for "a redesign" but its been disable for like 4-6 months now...
 Basically I'm looking for a free email provider that allow 3rd party app usage. If that requires app password generation thats fine but it needs to be a free feature included with basic free mail.
 Anyone recommend any free email host providers that will allow this function? Obviously ones that are not gmail or yahoo.
 At one point I was looking into proton mail but I forgot why that wasn't going to work. I think there was an email sent limit or something that turned me off from using it.

 Are certifications for people that are in the role to prove their knowledge with a brief refresh? or do they help at all in landing a better job with no prior experience in that field where certified.

The stacks all have full ring redundancy. As part of my testing I’ve been running various failure scenarios and in the event the stack master goes offline it is bringing down the entire stack. All ports on the other switches go offline for over a minute. The standby becomes the new master but it seems like the stack election is taking a long time. This should be close to instant shouldn’t it? Is there some configuration I’m missing for this to be faster or is that the expected behaviour?

 TLDR; stagger your server power on times to prevent power surges. 
 RFO:
 On November 23, 2022 at 02:41 GMT, CenturyLink identified a service impact in Orlando, FL. Operations Center (NOC) was engaged to isolate and investigate the cause of the outage. Initial analysis showed that a power failure in the Orlando area was the cause of the outage. The local power company repaired the commercial power but when all systems in the office tried to restore at once, the power surge tripped the main power breakers. Field Operations were onsite and reset the breakers to restore service at 03:36 GMT on November 23, 2022. The NOC will continue to monitor the alarms to ensure stability has been achieved.

I ran a backup using TFTP and watched on my TFTP server as the file loaded in, verified it was there, and then looked back at ISE which had an error stating "Copy to repository Failed". I'll most likely run another backup using FTP instead as the failure has me a bit nervous that the files may be incomplete or corrupt. Has anyone else seen this behavior before? If so did you happen to test these backups? The file sizes match previous backup file sizes and my TFTP server had no errors in it's logs to show.

 Let’s say you were part of that first wave of CCNAs, a young professional out of college and got CCNA and your first networking job in 1998 at the tender young age of 21. That means you’ve been working in networking for 24 years now, a true CLI Warrior. You’ve seen some stuff! But… you’re only 45 years old.

At location B, I have a SonicWALL configured with the network 10.30.19.x, with the SonicWALL serving as the DHCP server. The SonicWALL has a VPN to the datacenter. Clients are connected via Meraki switches and APs in bridged mode. Some clients at location B are receiving 10.30.11.x addresses from the DHCP server at location C, which also has a VPN connection to the data center. Is there a way to block DHCP requests from traversing the VPN? If not, how can I force location B clients to only use the local SonicWALL for DHCP? I appreciate any advice, as I don't want to break a production environment if at all possible! Happy Thanksgiving.

 edit: Devices at location C are also getting IPs from location B

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies if this is kind of a noob question but I'm wanting to setup a way to automate as much of the process as I can for new Windows 10 installs on desktops for end users. I'm wanting to achieve the below:
  
Run Windows 10 setup (unattended)
 
Boot into Windows and run Windows Updates, download drivers (Detect if GPU Intel/NVIDIA/AMD and download most up-to-date driver), run DISM/SFC/CHKDSK/Defender and reboot
 
Run updates again then reboot (at least x2)
 
Run Prime95 for 15 mins and write results to log file
 
Run memtest
 
Update BIOS
 
 ​
 Would a PXE server be the best way to go about the Windows 10 install itself, and can this be configured to run in unattended mode? I've created a batch file which will run DISM, SFC scan, schedule a CHKDSK for the next reboot, run a Windows Defender quick scan, run Windows updates and schedule a reboot for 30 minutes but I'm assuming there are better ways of doing this, especially since I'd need to manually copy this file across once the initial install has been completed and execute it manually. Any advice is appreciated!

I have messed with lmhosts etc. to try to fix this and have had no luck. there is a lot of scripts using similar authentications and I really don't want to update everything, would rather figure out why it suddenly stopped working after years of working fine. has anyone ran into this or something similar with the recent security hardening?

 We opened a new branch office and a S2S VPN tunnel is up between both Palo Alto firewall between branch office to HQ office. My question is, the layer 3 Cisco switch at the branch office using static IP addresses, what would be the next hop so that the branch office knows how to communicate with other IP networks at HQ? 
 I can ping the main physical interface 1(native) network 10.8.10.0/24 from the branch office to HQ, but cannot ping another sub-interface networks that live in HQ. 
 So far, this is the current IP static routes on the branch office layer 3 Cisco switch:
 Ip route 0.0.0.0/0 10.8.30.1 <- PA eth 1 gateway interfac Ip route 10.8.1.0/24 <- what would be the next hop for 10.8.30.0 network to communicate with other networks at HQ? 
 Ip route 10.8.0.0/24 <- what would be the next hop for 10.8.30.0 network to communicate with other networks at HQ? 
 I can ping from the Branch office to HQ subnet 10.8.10.0 which is the network on the physical interface at HQ but I can’t ping other networks as sub-interface. Is this a routing issue?

I am trying to confirm the path of the traffic so I can understand the issue and fix it. I have used tracert from my pc and it is not showing the default gateway in the hops when going from one subnet to another. I unplugged the GW and it fails to connect so it must be using it. Why is the Cisco not showing in the traceroute? Is there a better way to see the path that the packet is flowing?

I'm just comfortable with having to rapidly gather, digest, communicate, and prioritize significant amounts of information to/from multiple people explicitly because in Eve, I would have 60-300 people in a group with me needing similar communications for our internet space battles to go well. The group I was part of even had us do after action reports (AAR), and I swear its 1:1 what I have to do at my job. IDK how I would have been able to build this skillset in "the real world" with a similar level of non-consequence for failure. 
 If you are considering going into IT leadership/management, or just like terribly complicated grindy spaceship games full of massive try hard garbage, you should totally give leading fleets in Eve Online a try :P

 I searched the internet for articles about how to choose the right transceivers. I know that two transceivers will work together if they have the same wavelength and fiber type (MM or SM). All those articles talked about SFPs. They didn't mention their compatibility with GBICs.
 So my question is can SFP work together with GBIC if they share the same specifications (wavelength and fiber type)? Must they be with the same speed or can I buy 10gig SFP and connect it to 1gig GBIC?
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m not great at networking but I’m doing my best in the environment I inherited with little documentation. We have mostly Brocade switches with a few HP switches, but I want to replace some of them with Unifi switches. The current Vlans are as follows:
 1: Management (I know, I know – this needs to change)
 2: Corporate
 333: Guest 1
 666: Guest 2
 999: Unifi Management
 1000: Default VLAN
 I am working on running fiber home runs but in the meantime, many of these switches are daisy chained. So for example, floor 1 switch would have the router coming into port 1 and port 2 would go to floor 2 switch port 1. Port 2 from this switch would go to floor 3 switch port 1 and so on. These ports all use vlan 1 as their “primary” vlan (in the Brocade config it says “dual-mode 1” for these ports). T…]]></summary>

 I've been tasked with creating a hidden SSID for a small group of devices. These devices should ONLY be able to communicate with themselves in their respective subnet, i.e no access to other subnets or WAN. This SSID will need to be implemented in all 8 of our locations and the devices will travel to different locations. 
 We have a 2 tier architecture, so each location's distribution layer also handles the routing up to our main office. Our use of VLANS is minimal, we have 3 for VoIP, Data, and Management. Our wireless AP's are Ruckus. Our wireless LAN is using the "Management" vlan, or vlan 30 (Interface on SonicWall). This LAN is also what connects our switches to the SonicWall. 
 I'm trying to think of the best way to implement this, but I worry I may be overthinking it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, as the title reads, in an update from a while back I updated to some stable build (I don't remember which one) of Windows 11. I then noticed that my task scheduler script wasn't working, I checked whether everything was set up correctly, but then I looked at the Event Viewer, and EventID 4688 for process creation events was nowhere to be found. I then went through the documentation which (at the time) didn't say anything about Windows 11 and then contacted Microsoft, got elevated, and the support told me the feature was no longer supported.
 Now, luckily I only use this event for triggering a launch script, which is relatively easy to do manually through a shortcut, but this is still pretty annoying.
 Other sysadmins use this event for more important stuff, like monitoring the usage of their devices for many different types of purposes.If you want to vote on this feature to return, upvote this post in the Feedback Hub.
 Edit: The story gets, weirder, a recent insider build said it fixed this issue, while support and the technical writers have said that the feature isn't supported. Something really strange must be happening in Redmond...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So. I’ve managed to entrench myself at a small media company as their “tech support/IT/networking/anything nerdy” guy. Problem is a severe lack of understanding and appreciation about the entire field of IT and system support and I’m getting pretty “over it”. It’s a cobbled together network with no servers so nothing more than a UniFi router and switches and some APs, and most of my time is spent just doing tier 1 help desk crap and attempting to make some sort of sense of data management for a video production company that uses 30-60tb a quarter and wants all of it accessible at any time and doesn’t want to delete anything and also doesn’t understand why a production RAID isn’t a backup. 
 I’ve digressed a bit because my ACTUAL question is: even as a very quick learner and problem solver, am I just dead in the water being so out of the loop on industry standard systems and practices? Once upon a time I was a student admin for the defense department in the late 90’s early 00’s so I’m very in the loop in a general way and have plenty of hoop-jumping experience having worked for DOD and dealt with about every major red tape hurdle you could think of for IT and dev teams given the GsA phonebooks of rules and restrictions, BUT I just get dejected looking at current posting when they list about 5-10 different things I’ve never dealt with in my life because there hasnt been a need in my current career path. So I guess what I’m asking is, am I just super behind and if so, is there a resource anyone could recommend for “learning what it is I need to learn about” if that makes sense? I am fully capable of learning a new skill or system very rapidly but I just don’t know where to begin after being left “unsupervised” for this long. Thanks all and be gentle, I’m an old nerd stepping out of a cave for the first time in a decade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Need someone's brain I need to pick. I have a classic router on a stick. I'm doing a redesign of core and distribution layer. Would it be best-practice to enable portfast trunk on all interswitch links (core to distribution and distribution to access) to allow for fast reconvergence of my spanning tree? Or is this not recommended? 
 Had an issue today upon enabling a new link on my old core that caused a reconvergence and caused some clusters to lose their connection to their quorum ( thanks SAP); and I want to prevent this in the future.
 EDIT: for anyone finding this post in the future. Portfast trunk should only be enabled on ports linking to ehter a router/firewall or a device containing a virtual switch (Most Hypervisors; eg VMware). For edge devices, use portfast together with bpduguard.

 Trying to do a post-mortem on a weird situation I had yesterday. It seemed that one of our IPSEC VPN LAN-LAN connections was knocking out 2 -3 of our other LAN-LAN VPNs. Not finding anything in the logs besides "IPsec connection was disconnected passively. " There was some network troubleshooting being done at on of the other sites with a VPN, but theirs was not having any issues it seems.
 Tried all the basic troubleshooting/power cycling, rebuilt the VPN connections on each router. All the sudden towards end of day, started working normally. 
 I'm a sysadmin/jack of all trades/helpdesk position. Boss has more networking knowledge, but is out all week. My plan is to have the router in question replaced tomorrow, but wondering if anyone has any ideas, or tips how to get to the bottom of what was happening and if I really need to replace this router in question. It's been stable for about 18 hours.

Problem is, they are constantly exceeding the 64 character limit since hospital department and team names tend to be a bit verbose. I have tried copious abbreviations but then it looks like code that no one has the deciphering key to. Anyone else who has run into this, how to do manage this?

 Our current onprem password policy is 12 characters plus whatever else. We have noticed that hybrid joined devices seem to ignore that and instead use the Azure policy of 8 characters. There is now way to change the 8 character limit in Azure, so how do we force these devices to follow the onprem policy? 
 thanks in advance!

 I have a Macbook in Apple Business Manager (that synced to Jamf Now). I reset the macbook and turned it off then released it from Apple Business Mnager & Jamf Now. However a few days later trying to start it up and go through new setup its still connected to my organisation, click continue and it just says failed to get MDM.
 So 2 questions:
 1) Did I release it correctly, I think I did (similar process to Intune devices.
 2) How can I reset it from this state?
 Thanks in advance.

I follows the instructions listed here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/dns-zones-do-not-load-event-4000-4007
 and since this DC with the issue was the PDC I reset using itself as the target and that worked. server rebooted and i can open my dns again. However now i'm noticing the other DC's listing ":error" when looking at operations master in AD, and i can see this error on my PDC role DC that had the dns issue. 
 "Unable to verify the convergence of this machine account. does the machine account need resetting?" I see other people have used netdom to fix this, but i just did reset the machine password as per the Microsoft article so i'm confused if i need to reset it again, and if so with what syntax? or do i need to rest the other DC's? 
 Hopefully someone can explain this a bit better to me. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow sysadmins, I'm having a tough time figuring this one out, or I may just be running in circles. Does Remote Desktop Gateway only support NTLM authentication or is there a way to get it to use Kerberos? No matter what I've tried it always authenticates with NTLM to the Gateway, whether I am on premise or at home using KDCProxy. I've scoured every post on the net I can find but there's no straight answer on this. I've tried the flags rdgiskdcproxy:i:1 (my KDCProxy is my Gateway) and that didn't work. I am running NLA but I don't want to turn that off as that offers protection. I'm aware that NTLM is the protocol that will never die at this point, but if there is a way to implement Kerberos I would love some assistance. Thank you all very much in advance for any help or advice you might have. Gateway is running Windows Server 2022 Datacenter.

When I complain, I usually get the reply: "just make sure everything is working perfectly in the environment, and my code will work fine" . Just because your code thinks a "server" is unavailable doesnt mean it actually is. Got one right now. on a server restart it complains that the authentication server is unavailable. Im assuming it means the mssql server that it uses(which is up), and ill base my troubleshooting on that, but i could be wrong. PMs this is why troubleshooting custom applications takes so long!

 I've decided that's fine, I will just do it manually when needed -- whatever. Maybe MS will fix this. Nope. I think it's time to do something else.
 I know that some sysadmins are deploying printers locally to computers by using IP addresses. I'm unfortunately not very fond of this idea as you lose centralized spooler for that printer. Also way less painful if there is network change…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm quite new to networking and using servers in general and I'm experiencing a weird issue that's only just started to occur that I can't really find a solution for with google.
 I have a home media server connected to my network running Xubuntu with a static IP address (192.168.0.69) that I use at home to connect to for storing data, listening to music, programming and occasionally other things.
 Recently, I've been waking up to find that I can no longer connect to this device via my network.
 If I ping 192.168.0.69 from any device I own I recieve the following response:
 Pinging 192.168.0.69 with 32 bytes of data: Reply from 192.168.0.41: Destination host unreachable. Reply from 192.168.0.41: Destination host unreachable. Reply from 192.168.0.41: Destination host unreachable. Reply from 192.168.0.41: Destination host unreachable. 
 This problem, however, can immediately be resolved by going downstairs into the room where my router and server co-exist, and simply pressing the power button on said server, waiting until it switches off, then pressing the power button again.
 As soon as I do that, everything returns to normal and everything is up and connected for about 2-3 days until I inevitably wake up the next morning to find everything disconnected again.
 This has only just started to happen, it's been fine up until now.
 Any help is appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me start this by saying this whole situation is utter hell, but it's a necessity.
 I have a server that came from a company we acquired. On this server, let's call it HV1, we have a HyperV installation with 2 DC's, an APP/RDS Server and a DB server (MS Access), and all of these servers are on Server 2012 R2. This host is sitting cold on the network and will never touch the wider internet. On the APP/RDS server is a proprietary software that was developed by the former company over the course of 15 years and there's no documentation. It talks to MS Access files on the DB server and there is a mapped drive to these files on the APP/RDS server. The software is loaded from the APP/RDS server and seems to be very tied into the domain with domain authentication and will not boot unless one of the two DCs is powered on. If the DCs are off, I get some SQL network errors saying the system cannot contact a DC to service the auth request. Boot them on, the software loads and asks for credentials.
 I now need to repurpose this G9 server and use it for production, which means I need to migrate this setup away from this host and onto an older server which can continue sitting cold for X time. Essentially, replicating the entire setup from one server to another, and the only difference being that I'll be moving it to VMware instead of using HyperV. Instant concern when I was asked for this was the domain controllers.
 I've done the initial backup & restore using Veeam, and I now have all of the servers sat on my new host. The problem of course is the domain and DCs - They aren't functional/working and that domain essentially is non-existent at the moment.
 Before I go any further, I want to have a think about the potential best ways to bring these DCs back to life, purely for the purpose of getting this application working again.
 Thoughts?
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unfortunately we're still very much learning how to use Endpoint Management with Azure, as the main business is still on prem. However, the "side business" uses exclusively Azure
 We don't have auto enrolment available to use, and are relying on users logging in on the new laptop. The problem then is that the user becomes local admin, which is bad. The solution to this has been to create an entry in user account protection that sets the only admins as "administrator" (local admin) and a special pcadmin account we created on Azure AD. To my understanding, this is fine
 The issue we have though, is if we need to support a user remotely, we can't elevate privileges in Bomgar (BeyondTrust) using the Azure account, it only seems to support local user accounts. This hasn't been a problem as we were with the users logging into their laptops, so we could set the admin password at the machine, but the case has arisen where I need to do something on a laptop which was bought and remains in another country
 I was hoping I could, as a temporary workaround, add a PS script to enable and set the local admin password, but either it's not working or the laptop just won't sync, because it's not made a difference
 Is there a solution to my problem, or do I need to take a few steps back and make some bigger changes to our system (other than auto-enrolment)
 ​
 Bonus question - my employer will pay for training courses. Is there a recommended one I can go on for Enpoint Manager/Intune? I've seen the Azure course, but I fear that doesn't really cover the device management I need to learn

 We've introduced a new ERP back in August. We've got Vmware Horizon VDIs (4 cores, 8GB RAM, Win Server 2016) and the employees use MS Edge to access the ERP. Everything worked great until now, now some of them are having major performance issues when scrolling/clicking through the webclient. It doesn't crash, but the entire browser becomes unresponsive for 8-10 seconds. Same result with Chrome and Firefox. The majority has Teams, Outlook, a few Excel sheets, a few Chrome tabs and MS Edge open, which uses around 30% CPU and 60% RAM altogether.
 I tested it on the local thinclient browser and it runs fine there, so the problem only seems to persists on the VDIs.

 Now, I was expecting at least some sort of minimal central management, but sadly no. It's just spreadsheets, as far as the eye can see, each "designed" by someone different and with varying levels of techno-fluff.
 So, my first job is to sort those spreadsheets into something manageable. I've no experience managing this much equipment and objects, so no idea where to start - my background is developer/opportunistic devops/dogs body, so it's not like it's particularly daunting for me.
 For what it's worth, Zabbix is installed and actually appears to up to date and useful, so it's not so much monitoring that I'm looking for as it is management.
 On my list to check out is:
  
netbox
 phpipam
 openDCIM

 Printer/copier/fax: Canon imageRUNNER 1730i
 Is there a way, for documents that are forwarded from the fax machine, to show sender info in the body of the email?
 ​
 Curently fax's are fowarded from [copier@ourcompany.com](mailto:copier@ourcompany.com) and sent to all staff emails. These emails have a basic subject line which I can edit "our company ltd" and have an attached pdf of what was sent through. The naming of the pdf is randomly generated and no sender info is available in the body of the email.
 Currently faxs are not printed, only forwarder to all of the team.
 It is very difficult to find older fax emails as there is no way to search by specific sender email or phone. (I think they are all coming in via fax # but have no way to confirm.
 I feel there is a check box somewhere in admin settings I am missing or not understanding that could apply sender info to fwd'd email somehow.
 Any help appreciated!
 Cheers,
 Cheap

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can anyone suggest why an MSI unattended installation (using msiexec /i) would work when the installer files are copied locally, but not when they're on a network drive?
  
The installer uses files external to the MSI.
 The MSI contains a copy of 7z.exe which it extracts to a folder under %TEMP% and uses to extract the external files (they are .wxi.7z files in an Installer.Components folder).
 I've already tried setting the FilterAdministratorToken registry setting in case it was to do with that, but that had no effect.
 The MSI was made using the WIX installer toolset.
 I tried doing caspol.exe -q -machine -addgroup 1 -url file://Z:/* FullTrust -name "Z Drive" as WIX is apparently a .NET application and may need extra permissions to be able to access network drives, but this did not fix the issue.
 I tried doing a Process Monitor capture to see if I could identify what was wrong, but nothing popped out at me.
 The installer log file contains the errors "Error. Failed to attach console to process. Error Code: 5. Error. 7z.exe returned exit code: 0"
  
Because the install files are large (total is around 24GB), I don't want to have to copy them locally onto machines I need to deploy this app on.

We're using some consumer-grade tethering hotspots with a stipulation that users connect to the corp VPN when using it. They're mostly fine when coupled with EU data-roaming SIMs, but setup is manual and we have no policy control so the system isn't scaling well and we can't debug issues. 
 What I'd like is something that's still a small, rechargeable device, but that offers enterprise niceties such as:
  
Dual SIM (Not essential, but it can help in some edge cases)
 Management portal with signal and usage metrics and connection logs.
 Simple L3 controls. (At least so I can force users to connect to our full-tunnel VPN)
  
If you're familiar with the Cradlepoint ecosystem, then basically this, but with a smaller, battery-powered chassis.

 My colleague who does not work on this project anymore, created the CA infra on my domain. For some testing purposes he created multiple certs for both the root and the intermediate servers. 
 I would like to sanitize this config, so only the current and valid cert is visible. 
 On Certificate Authority app I right click the server at the top of the tree, Properties, and on the General tab there are 2 CA certificates for my intermediate server. I revoked (from the root) the one which I don't need, published the CRL, deleted this cert (backed up previously) from the intermediate server itself (cert store), but on this list it is still visible.
 Is there a way to delete from this list? Or is that enough what I have done?

 I have a migration of a server containing all the backup copies of our VMs via a hardware RAID, and I am looking for information on the feasibility of the trick.
 Currently I have an HP DLXXX G8 with 12 SATA LFF, and I have a DLXXX G9, with the correct slots, and a P840 which is fine.
 My seller more or less told me this: "Normally, you move the disks, and the RAID is automatically recognized, and it starts again", I find it hard to believe that it will go so well, however, I do not have the technical possibility of moving all the content to another storage (no space available, no financial means to buy 12 LFF of 8 TB , we are a very small company). 
 Have you ever had the experience, it goes well in general? Thanks in advance :D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/networking
 Looking for some feedback on something. We have had a dev come to us - asking for access to pcap driver for sniffing traffic to locate certain devices.
 My initial reaction to this was a hard no - as I was always taught this was a very bad thing to do. With the risk of intercepting unencrypted data such as passwords etc.
 In today's world - would you consider this as much of a risk? My personal thoughts are:
  
L2 boundaries (such as VLAN with SVI) will limit what can be easily sniffed.
 plaintext data is a risk no matter what (should be wrapped or encryption).
 purely talking about sniffing of packets, not any other related attacks, the risks are minimal if everything is encrypted?
  
edit: I should mention my recommendation was for scanning the ip-ranges instead (as this would also allow for situations where devices are in another l3 network). You could pre-populate with the ip range of the adapter used for the scan.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/networking,
 I’d love to get some advice from the community and get some pointers on where I can take my career. I’ve worked at a MSP for about 2 years and for the last 5 years I’ve worked for school district where I’m the lone systems and network administrator. I’m fully in charge of maintaining and upgrading about 100 switches and 400 access points, mix of Meraki and Cisco across 11 sites. About 5000 users in total. For the network end I’ve implemented and swapped out access layer switches, implemented a basic single area OSPF, setup vlans/port security/BYOD network/etc., maintain a wireless network and troubleshoot various problems that come up. 
 As for the systems side of it. I’m also in charge of managing and upgrading servers. I’ve done multiple domain controller upgrades, file server migrations, NPS servers, DHCP, Print, Hyper-V upgrades/deployments, Image creation from Windows 7 to Windows 11. 
 I’ve also been point person on several projects, some with outside vendor and some internal. 
 My question to the community is, I feel I have a very good picture of IT from a big picture but I would love to become a more advanced network engineer and climb up the salary rank. Where can I take my next step to really speed up the learning process? I’ve done MSP work before but feel they always get bogged down with lower tier busy work and are very cookie cutter from my experience. 
 I’ve got my degree and in the midst of attaining my CCNP. Any advice? Any recommended industries?

 Besides getting a networking job(soon, fingers crossed) are there any good resources where I can learn about network designs at a high level? Not so much ones concerned with the minutia of network configurations.

I had seen the occasional iPhone have an IP DHCP learning failure and not really causing huge concerns nobody was really yelling about it but was getting a little concerned as we move close to doing a mass deployment of a major building. It turns out from looking through some forums and then my own config I hadn't actually had the DHCP helper addresses on the SVI in question on the controller.
 Here's my problem, I don't know how any of the devices were getting thcp if there was no relay address configured. The only thing I can think is in the WLAN config I did have the IP of the DHCP server entered, but that's different than the helper address. So I'm a bit stumped as to why it ever worked, also why iOS seems to be the only operating system that felt any impact.

 We have a lot of staff turnover, so machines go from old user to new user, often.
 We have a fleet of identical hardware with identical SOE yet the odd machine will die on users, apparently. I'd really like to thoroughly test the machines before handing to staff.
 I can run memtest, I can run prime95 but is there anything bootable? Even some kind of intense linux benchmarking suite would be fine? I just want to 'fire and forget' - come back to a machine 8 hours later and see if it passed or not.
 Anyone got something even close to this?

 At my current employer, the engineer before me configured each switch weird. On the switches; the first 24 ports are for the Data Vlan and the next 24 ports are for the Voice Vlan. The issue is computers and IP phones are connected to random ports - which then makes a lot of computers and IP phones on the wrong vlan.
 ​
 What is an easy way of cleaning this up? Only way I can think of is going to each port and assigning the correct vlan. Is this the correct way to do it?
 ​

We simply used the Schannel registry method to disable strong mapping, but we'd like to fix the issue properly. The doc below from Microsoft leaves a lot to be desired in terms of what to do with AD CS and existing cert templates. 
 It sounds like using an additional field in the Alternative Subject Name might do the trick, but should I enable that on the existing certificate template and wait for clients to auto renew, or issue a new one? Issuing a new one seems wise so it can be dished out in stages for testing, but it's unclear if the correct cert will be chosen if two exist in the user's personal store. 
 Do we also need to issue new certs for the actual NPS server?

 In my short time here, we've received several types of tickets asking for "the PC sitting over in Karen's old desk area" to be reimaged or "Frank left the company a few months ago, I have his laptop in my lower desk drawer. Can someone go grab it and image it up ASAP? His replacement starts Monday and he's going out to a customer site Monday afternoon."
 I mentioned to my boss this seems out of the ordinary and he insisted it's always been this way and he'd rather have the end user's departments responsible for managing their inventory than it falling onto us. Consequently, there are HPs, Dells, Lenovo, Microsoft and Asus desktop & laptops out there due to departments making the decision on what they want to purchase.
 Is there anyone else out there in a similar situation? If so, how do you make it work? My gut reaction is to push for this to be changed, but I'm so new and not sure if I want to rock the boat quite yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is Microsoft support just non-existent? Did all of the real talent holding things together just leave?
 Years ago, i would open a support request, get a response in 6-24 hours, work with a 1st tier support, get escalated once or twice, then work with someone that really knew the product, or watch as the person i was working with gave KVM control to some mythical support tier person that would identify an issue and return a fix. It could be AD, Exchange, windows server, etc. It was slow, but as long as your persisted, you would eventually get to someone that could fix your issue.
 In the last few years though, something has changed. I get passed between queues. I get told to make changes that take services offline. Simple things like "the cloud shell button works everywhere but in the exchange admin web console" gets passed around until i get an obviously thoughtless response of i ..."need to have a subscription to Exchange to use the cloud shell."
 This extended beyond cloud services. I've had a number of tickets for other microsoft products that get no where. I've received calls from support personnel angry that i would agree to close a ticket that has not been fixed. I get someone calling me at 4am to work on a low-priority issue that ive' requested email communication.

These PST files were exported when an employee departed from the company before everything was moved to 365. Some may be ancient and can be deleted. Then that leaves what to do with the other 50 PST's from former employees that are sitting there not being accessed?
 Option A: Move to Sharepoint with the rest of File Server Contents. 
 Option B: Move to shared 365 mailboxes.
 Option C: What PST's? I never seen them. 
 Option D: Portable Hard Drive :/
 Update: From the responses it seems clear the best path is B which I was already leaning heavily towards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 One of our sites is having an issue where external calls are occasionally getting static. It doesn't happen every time nor with every phone, but they get it consistently enough that it seems to be on our end. Looking at some of the calls they have reported on in Mitel Connect Director, there seems to be a correlation of either a high MOL, high delay, or both with these calls, but I'm not sure how to troubleshoot this further, mainly because the site uses our organizations main PRIs and no one else has reported any issues with static. We had some issues with one of our PRI recently that were resolved, and I was hoping that might also resolve this, but the problem has persisted now for over a month. 
 Is packet capturing the way to go? Are there any other methods to troubleshooting I should try or common causes for poor delay or MOL? Jitter has notably been perfectly fine across all the troublesome calls.

I went to the ASR 9010 and did “no username Cisco” and “no username root” ,then created both users again and changed password using “secret xxxxx” .So while recreating the users ,I didn’t assign them to respective groups/task groups.So right now on one ASR 9010-I can access it but I can pretty much not do anything on the router ,Not even see running config because the users I created have no privileges and I can’t enter “admin conf” mode to give privileges to a user .
 Is there any way I can fix this screw up ? Any links or suggestions welcome .
 I didn’t screw up the other ASR 9010s,I just went to each user and changed password instead of deleting and recreating a user to give them a password .
 P.s we don’t have Cisco tac access anymore because we are about to handover the devices .Some political bull shit

 Some recent projects have us with some spare (and old) equipment that is probably worth keeping for at least a little while. Our current organization system has them in a anti-static bag at the bottom of a drawer. 
 Anyone have a good suggestion for a cost effective way to organize transceivers and DAC cables? 
 For fiber patch cables we use handing folders in a portable file tote. One folder per cable length works fairly well for what we normally have on-hand. Cables have a little bit of protection, it is easy to grab and take with you and you can very quickly find the length you are looking for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think this is a story many of you here can relate to...
 My ex-boss hired me in January of this year. He'd kept the IT dept running on a small budget while putting in the overtime and working weird hours to patch things outside of business time. He made no bones about being overworked but it was obvious he wasn't going anywhere since he'd been there for so long (at least, that's what I had assumed given his long tenure with the company - 15+ years).
 Requests for a larger budget to replace equipment and grow the IT department were universally rejected. There has only been one exception recently which was the addition of my position to the IT team. Apparently this is something my boss had been pushing for years since the company is doing really well and expanding across the board. 
 8 or 9 weeks ago some shit hit the fan, one of the higher ups spoke to my overworked boss in a way that definitely was not well received. All of this revolved around a situation that I'm sure could have been avoided with properly scaling IT to the company's growth. My boss put in his 2 week notice on the spot.
 Fast forward to today - servers are down and multiple services and network storage drives are inaccessible. There are 3 of us at the help desk with no clue how to fix it. There are plenty applicants and interviews to fill the position but I can only assume the salary offers are too low since none of the people who come through are ever heard from again.
 A large part of the company is dead in the water today. Good times.

 idk, I have to research and test all the individual items, then validate them across platforms.
 Great, how long will that take?
 i.d.k; some items might take 10 minutes, others might take 3 hours to figure out. It's impossible to say. Also, this has been tertiary priority so far. We've been prioritizing patching and security issues over this.
 Ok, how soon can we deploy this?
 It's impossible to say. Would you like to prioritize this convenience item over patching and security concerns?
 Obviously patching has to come first, but when can we get this one done.
 FFS, ID-F'N-K. 
 ​
 seriously..... What am I expected to do? just quote some random bullshit time frame that I pull out of my ass on the spot? There are 60ish components in the convenience item, that have to each be individually developed, tested, verified, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm sure there is a name for this I just don't know what it is. Other than corporate fat.
 All the chatter recently had me thinking about this and I've been helping a farmer the past couple of weekends finish up his harvest where we are hustling all day which is a loose comparison to IT but there's no Pingpong table or game room to slip off to (this is a big company reference). (and feels good for a change of pace.)
 I was thinking about the 8 companies I've worked at over the past 22 years other than the super small companies with 1 or 2 people in the whole IT department every place I've worked at has so many wasted hours. 
 I've hired on at more than one place where they are going on about being swamped and then it's two weeks before I even get a laptop and spend half the day chatting with everyone or listening to them complain about policies. 
 Then in every place with a team of people, there have always one or two superstars and the rest are just there either doing busy work or not really doing anything. 
 Next are all the meetings, the bigger the company the more you have, and the more you just get invited to for no reason other than you replied to an email one time. Of course, there are always people who just love to take advantage of this rather than get work done. 
 I've been on both sides of it too. I worked at one place in the early 2000s where I spent six months going to quiet rooms in the building and spending the day playing Civilization V without anyone noticing or caring. I've also been the superstar who's spent a solid 30-40 hours a week getting something done. 
 This is just my opinion but overall from what I've seen in corporate America the next major recession we are going to see job reductions in IT similar to what happened to manufacturing jobs in 2008. And those job nubmers never returned to pre 2008 levels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 ​
 I inherited the wonderful responsibility of having to approve new softwares to be introduced to our environment. Basically, as of now, users submit requests for new softwares to the helpdesk, and then they ask my team to review the software prior to allowing it to be installed. The only issue with this current process is that, I have exactly zero idea how other medium sized enterprises validate software. My question is two fold.
 ​
 Firstly, what information do you request from the users when they ask for a new software to be introduced to the environment. So far this is the list i've come up with.
  
1. Is there existing software that can be used
 2. Business need for software
 3. Is this for a project
 4. What is the impact if this software is not approved
 5. What specific task will get done using this software.
  
Secondly, how do you know if the software is safe to introduce? Right now, here is what I do..
  
Run the software installer through our EDR sandbox
 Check if the installation is signed
 Try installing the software on a test box
 Googling the software / the hash
  
The only issue with my current method is that a lot of times our engineers find these really niche tools from github etc that do extremely specific things. I don't have a good way of validating any of these as I can't read through the code and understand what they do in a timely fashion. That would take me several days / weeks if I did that for every software. Any advice would be great!

A lot of them use old software like Impact, Incode, KVS and absolute garbage like that, if you're familiar. Most of them are looking for new software (finally) but i don't really have any suggestions. I don't know much about this stuff, but i was wondering if any of you fine folks would have any ideas.
 EDIT: Thanks for all the suggestions. I didn't think my post would get much traction and I appreciate the feedback.

This is used in our Horizon environment, the UAG points to this for authentication. Since we have had various issues with this server, instead of upgrading the current server, I have been tasked with standing up a new Ubuntu 20.04 LTS server and setting this up with FreeRADIUS and Google Auth, then migrating over the configuration/database to avoid having to enroll all users with Google Auth again. I did some research but did not find too much information on how to easily migrate the Google Auth database to the new server. I found these two articles (Clone and Restore FreeRADIUS Setup and Sharing Google Auth Keys), but I wasn't sure that it would work. Does anyone have experience with a migration like this, who could point me in the right direction?

 What I'm not sure about is this: so inbox 1 last synced 30 minutes ago. Inbox 2 last synced yesterday at 5:54PM. Inbox 3 last synced at 2:21PM. There is still mail arriving to these inboxes, and I want to make sure that no mail get's left behind when I complete the migration and swap the MX records. Does a "final sync" run when I approve or complete the migration batch? And if not, then how do I ensure the mail in the recipient inbox is up-to-date the minute of the switch?
 The mail account domains need to be the same while the migration runs on the sending and receiving end, due to this we can't set a forward that will work. So assuming there is no way to do this "final sync" I suppose I could complete the migration batch on Thursday evening, swap their 365 accounts to .onmicrosoft.com, set up the forward from the Gmail accounts until they leave on Friday while manually sending over the few emails that may have been missed by the migration sync, change the MX, then log on and set up their profiles. Bit of a long way around it but eh there's only 5 users.

        <updated>2022-11-21T13:49:07.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, recently purchased a refurb DL380 Gen9 with the NVMe enablement kit (part no 774741-B21 which consists of a PCIe NVMe controller, drive cage with backplane and 3 PCI express cables). I installed 6 x Kingston DC1500M drives (firmware version S67F0103, no newer available) and whilst they all work, I can only get PCI express Gen 3 link speed on port 1 & 2 of the controller. The other 4 drives (port 3, 4, 5 and 6) only operate at Gen 1 link speed.
 Output in lspci with correct speed (port 1 & 2):
  LnkSta: Speed 8GT/s (ok), Width x4 (ok) TrErr- Train- SlotClk+ DLActive- BWMgmt- ABWMgmt- 
 Output in lspci with slower speed (port 3, 4, 5, 6):
  LnkSta: Speed 2.5GT/s (downgraded), Width x4 (ok) TrErr- Train- SlotClk+ DLActive- BWMgmt- ABWMgmt- 
 Things I tried:
  
Reset BIOS: no change. There are also no options to configure link speeds.
 Move drives around: no change. It doesn't matter which drive is connected where, port 1 & 2 run at Gen 3 whilst the other run at Gen 1
 Move cables around: no change
 Swap cable connections: connected port 1 & 2 to port 5 & 6 on the backplane. Still only port 1 & 2 run at Gen 3 whilst the the other run at Gen 1. That rules out a backplane problem
 Swapped NVMe controller: no change
 Connect only port 5 & 6: runs at Gen 3
 Firmware upgrade of NVMe controller: was already at latest version 1.78
 All other firmware is up to date
  
So it looks like in whatever combination, I can only get 2 of the 6 drives to run at full Gen 3 speed whilst the other downgrade to Gen 1. There are some jumpers on the NVMe controller but I can't find any documentation on what they do and I doubt it's going to make a difference anway. Needless to say this quite kneecaps the performance of the NVMe drives... Anything else I can try?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Redditors,
 I am currently facing a business requirement that is outlined in the image below:
 https://imgur.com/a/gZ76JIm
 This is a hard-set requirement from management.
 My current idea is to use L3VPN and play around with RT-Import/Export to achieve this (I am open to different suggestions as well). 
 However, I have faced the following problems so far:
  
I have to achieve this with IPv6 as well, it seems some of our equipment doesn't support 6VPE, my question is, would there be any other way to accomplish this for IPv6 in this case? 
 Looks like I can't have different VRFs for IPv4 and IPv6 in the same interface nor can have IPv6 in the main routing table while the interface is part of a VRF
 
 We have an anti-DDoS system that injects routes via BGP to modify the communities for the attacked /24s, currently, this doesn't modify the next-hop (we keep the next-hop intact) we just modify the community in order to tell the edge routers "stop all broadcasts to all transits but the scrubbing capable ones". However, being that this is going to use AF VPNv4 and VPNv6 I don't see how I can just keep the next-hop unaltered nor how I could set this up. 
 I can't just tell the network "the next-hop is the loopback of core/dist-1" like we currently do, since now the network is inside of a VRF
 Just to clarify, the anti-DDoS injects a route with a higher LPREF than the ones advertised by the core/dist switches at this moment, this causes the edge routers to prefer that one and apply policies based on the communities present on that specific one 
 
 I have also concerns about scalability, we currently have ASR1004/1006 with RP2@16GB and receive full routing tables from prov-2 and prov-1, IXP routes from prov-3 and around 50k routes from prov-4 (and this is only IPv4)
  
Our equipment is a mix of Huawei CE68XX and Cisco ASR1004/1006. 
 Any ideas, hints, or guidelines, especially if you have solved an issue like this before would be really appreciated.

It’s on site and I’m a mom so I would have to pay for day care and I’m near DC, day care is super expensive around here. Luckily my boyfriend works and makes the money, so it could work. But not sure if $20 an hour is enough, especially for where I live.
 I’m just not sure if I should take this position. Maybe it could be a good entry level experience for me to move up but again, I’m studying for Cyber Security and have 0 experience in the field at all. Thoughts? Should I take the position?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying to find a way to scan all our mobile devices for their eSIM capability and so far I've come up empty.
 We are considering switching from physical SIM cards to eSIM but did not take note of the IDs when we received the devices. And we've got a few different iterations of devices even within the same modell (Gen1, Gen2, ..) so it isn't entirely clear to us which devices support eSIM or not.
 Scanning for regular broadband internet capability is easy enough:
  
netsh mbn show interfaces
  
And even getting information about regular SIM cards is no problem:
  
netsh mbn show read interface=*
  
But I can't find an easy way to figure out whether a device supports eSIM or not.
 Reading https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/configuration/esim-device-configuration and https://www.petervanderwoude.nl/post/configuring-esim-profiles-on-windows-devices/ lead me to believe that I somehow should be able to get at least the ICCID somehow. But the first netsh command above only returns the regular broadband adapter with no hint whether the device supports eSIM or not.
 Further reading brought me to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/mb-esim-operations and the "Hardware Lab Kit" test from Microsoft which is supposed to feature a "netsh mbn test feature=esim" test but ... this feels way out of scope (settings up a HLK server and whatnot) for something that ... I feel should be a lot simpler.
 The only way I've found so far is manually checking the broadband settings GUI of the settings app for the availability of eSIM profiles. Which is ... not great for automation.
 Does anyone have a better idea on how to scan for eSIM capability? (Preferably something PowerShell or cmd.exe (netsh) if needed. No Azure or Intune (we use SCCM).)

 I'm looking to receive around 1000 emails in a minute at some point. Is there any suggestion of what I can do to make sure that I receive these emails? It is not continuously 1000 per minute, it is just approx 1000 all in one go in one minute and then that is it for a long time (days).
 Is there any paid service I could use that doesn't have such rate limits? If not, what do you suggest?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morning All,
 ​
 At my wits end here and not sure where else to turn since Microsoft are unable to help.
 ​
 We recently have been trialling a new backup solution, to start with it was working fine, then when we expanded it to more servers we started seeing the issue where the avhdx files are being created but cannot be merged because "Error: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process. (0x80070020)"
 ​
 We also have an important server that we want replicated to another site and are unable to replicate because the HRL file also cannot be processed because of the same error.
 ​
 This is affecting multiple servers, with different versions of windows, 2016, 2019 and 2022.
 ​
 Suspected a windows update, removed the last few and rebooted, no change, removed the backup solutions agent and rebooted, same, no change.
 ​
 As a temporary fix, I shut down the VM, removed the VHDX file from the VM settings and moved it to a different folder then re-added the file to VM settings.
 ​
 Checkpoints seem to work and the backup solution will run fine manually, but then it will eventually stop working again.
 ​
 We used to use Veeam, but this has been removed. We also have another solution installed that we were going to use but never configured. I believe this is based around Acronis, but as I said, its not running anything, just installed.
 ​
 Any suggestions?
 ​
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For weeks now I have been trying to wrap my head around a problem I just can't figure out. I'll try to explain it as best as I can.
 We are providing our users with Dell Latitute computers. At the moment we have anything from 7490 to 7430, and somewhere around 5320/7420 the problems started to arise.
 We issue our users with Jabra Evolve2 65 headsets so they can participate in Skype for Business meetings (we are not allowed to use Teams, don't ask...). It all seems to be working well, until after a week or two when the users who have been issued with a new computer comes back and complains that Skype is crashing when they use the headset. If they connect the USB dongle whatever sound settings you open (be it Skype or Windows), will freeze the program. 
 I thought it was just a simple problem with Jabra, but after testing more thoroughly it turns out the problems are there for any USB sound dongle from any brand. We've tried updating the Realtek driver, and that works but only for a while once again, or just makes the Sound settings incredibly slow to navigate, not entirely frozen. Its also not universal which computers work decently with new drivers, and which will still not work.
 The problem is now big enough we can't decide on new headsets to buy, because we simply don't know if we can make them work. Are we the only ones with this issue, or has someone else found a solution to get us through this dongle hell hole?

 ​
 But in the process I wanted to see if I can make the usb installation more hands off with a unattend file, but I keep running into the issue that a product key is needed. The few things i've tried are using the windows 11/10 pro general key under the windows-setup/UserData/ProductKey, not having the point to having the point but no licesnse. But still the same error about not being able to read the <productkey> part from the answerfile.
 ​
 How do you guys usually handle this?
 ​
 I'd preferably not have a license in the unattend file, since the computers all come with pro, and I want to activate the already given license.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have experience working with dual boot pc-s, setting them up and hacking them (in the old sense of the word) but only 1 at a time. Now, I the computer science teacher became the sysadmin of the school where I teach and I should get them in shape. Now Ubuntu and Windows 10 Pro are installed and every PC has one user with admin rights (yikes!). I would like to change this.
 I have a general idea and I know that I'm capable of hacking something together but I would like to do it in a proper way, e.g. in a way which probably requires me to put in more effort in the beginning but it should then spare me headaches in the future.
 My idea in general is the following: Students should learn how to (de)install apps, use said apps + MS Office + webbrowsing, get to know the OS-s (Windows 10 Pro and Ubuntu), learn the basics of fotoshop, do some programming in Python and execute them in the command line. On the other hand, it would be nice if let's say after midnight every PC would return to its original state which would prevent the students to do nasty stuff. The student would need to store everything in the cloud of on a USB-stick. The cherry on the pie would be the fact that the PC-s update themselves whenever needed. I'm thinking about maybe even creating a user for every student? But that seems a bit unnecessary, given that they can only access the PC-s in the school and not much else.
 Is there any software which already has this bundle? Or how does one achieve these goals without reinventing the wheel?

 On my laptop Dell Latitude 5410 ( with Windows 10 ) I have installed VMware Workstation Player 16 and inside it I have an AlpineLinux ( with static IP 192.168.1.114 ) with a VPNC client for company private networks . For this I use a route in windows ( route add 10.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0 192.168.1.114 -p ).
 When I use Ethernet connection (cable) everything works fine, but when I use Wifi card/connection I can't connect to these private networks.
 The VPNC client connects to the networks and I have connectivity to the private networks from AlpineLinux but not from Windows.
 I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the network drivers (wifi and ethernet) and nothing changes.
 On that VM I use the "Bridged: Directly connected to physical network" connection.
 Thanks a lot.

 I'd like to know if there's a possibility to disable Windows Updates "forever"/OnceForAll" with a policy in the AD. I'd like to have a group policy so nobody can't update windows or better. That no one is able to choose that option.
 I don't know if it sounds like very difficult or if there's way to deactivate for a group.
 Thanks alot in advance.
 I've been learning a lot the couple of month and I think with the redditors and community I feel motivated and please keep learning and sharing. =)

 I‘d like to have some advice on a migration/integration topic:
 I was tasked to plan the integration of the infrastructure of another company into mine.
 Both infrastructures contain an Active Directory and Azure Environment as well as Intune/Endpoint manager.
 Needless to say that I’ve never done that before – and my knowledge of Active Directory stems from my apprenticeship which was many years ago. In the meantime, I’ve worked with an IAM solution like Okta. 
 While the way the new accounts are created follow a fully automatic process,
 I wonder if there is an “easy” way to migrate all mailboxes, teams, groups, and MDM devices. All I found were guides that seem to include a huge amount of manual work – or deeper knowledge of PowerShell. There solutions might turn out to be frictionless and not that hard, but I cannot evaluate that based on my knowledge/experience.
 So, I see two ways to solve that problem:
 1) Get into the PowerShell Scrips to automate parts of the progress
 2) Search for a full featured migration tool that handles the work for me
 For the second point – of course it will be less effort, but my main concern on that topic is time. It must be done as soon as possible. 
 I am looking forward to getting some new insides into this.
 Thanks in advance for every advice

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Folks,
 I'm looking for some guidance as a very green sysadmin. I've recently joined a new MSP as a Support Engineer. I went out to work on a VPN connection issue the other day and noticed something extremely badly configured. I suspect the reason we're having so many issues is that the clients' LAN is on a 192.168.1.x/24 subnet...the most common subnet ISP routers provide.
 I'm fairly new here, but I looked around the firewall and found a ton of NAT rules that are basically trying to get around this problem of "What happens when you're on 192.168.1.x and you try to connect via SSL VPN to LAN that is also 192.168.1.x so you can RDP into a machine " 
 Obviously, this is a bad configuration I think what needs to happen is that network needs to be on VLAN with a more corporate-friendly subnet(172.x.x.x or 10.x.x.x) but I honestly don't know where to start. No one's going to fix it without a nudge, or they might do something nutty like I've seen already and just make an interface with a 172.x.x.x IP on the firewall and NAT *Everything* through that. Where do I start with a plan to fix this network?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, 
 I´m having a problem regarding a surface pro 7.
 I wanted to reinstall windows on said surface using a bootstick I prepared with Windows 10.
 I accidentally picked the wrong stick with Surface Hub OS on it.
 Since the installation is the same as a normal Win10 installation I ran through it and noticed that I installed Surface Hub OS on my Surface Pro 7,
 Now I tried to get rid of it in the following ways:
  
Win10 Bootstick
 LinuxLive Bootstick
 Surface Reset Stick with Serial Number
 Surface Hub Reset Stick with Serial Number (from a real Surface hub because the Surface Pro 7 isn´t a Surface Hub)
 Resetting the UEFI firmware
  
Everything I tried didn´t work.
 When trying to boot from USB it either kicks me back to BIOS or it just boots up SurfaceHub.
 Since the UEFI firmware reset it gives a red line on the bootscreen but it kicks me back to BIOS though.
 I don´t know what to do since MS Professionals recommend booting from a Win10 stick *facepalm*
 I hope someone can help.
 PS: I already heard someone say "just get the ssd out and partition it on another device" but since it´s a surface and I don´t want any soldering action I don´t want to try that.

 I'm turning to you guys for help. I don't know if what I'm looking for is possible, hence maybe you guys can help me out. 
 I have a private laptop (Dell Inspiron 7391 2-in-1) and a work Laptop (HP Elitebook). Both notebooks support thunderbolt. I have 1 monitor (Lenovo Thinkvision), 1 mouse, 1 keyboard, 1 headset and a external harddrive. 
  
I am looking for a compatible docking station for both laptops and my periphery devices. Something I can just connect one laptop, and then pull out and connect the other laptop (one at a time). I have been looking at the Targus 190 and the Dell WD 19TBS. 
 I was also wondering can you hook up a KVM switch to a docking station? So that you can just switch between the computers with a press of a button? If no, can you hook up a KVM switch to a monitor? I have the UGREEN USB 3.0 Switch - but it somehow doesn't hook up my monitor. 
  
​
 Thanks for your help - sorry if these questions are a bit "dumb".

Now I can choose when booting: windows or ubuntu. Now I want to move my windows to m2 ssd. So my question is, how do I correctly install now Windows so I won't lose my Ubuntu installation?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I got a question but I feel like I first have to explain the background a little bit: I have a customer with very specific requests. They need a system of 4 client and 2 server machines (will all be Windows 11 / Windows Server 2022) together with some additional network hardware (NAS, printers). The special thing is that this small network will run completely isolated and will not be connected to WAN or any other networks (for a fact I'm planning on physically plugging non used LAN ports on all devices). They need an AD running but only with generic users (Factory User, Storage User and so on) and no personal users. One of the servers will function as a Domain Controller. And They need that exact same system running on several different sites across the country. Like it has to be exactly the same, down to every single AD user.
 So since the the setup will be identical on all sites and not connected to the outside whatsoever, I had the idea to set this up in my lab one time, configure it to the customers likes and then just take images from every machine. If then the order for a site arrives, I could just use my specific images to prepare the machines. I've done it like that before but never with an AD involved, hence my questions. Oh and we use Symantec Ghost for imaging, if that matters. So here my questions:
  
Can you think of anything arguing against cloning AD machines, for example a Domain Controller?
 When I clone all machines after they are added to the AD and then restore these images on other machines, will they be added properly to the new site's AD (since the hostnames get cloned as well) or will this be spotty? I could join them to the AD manually for each site if need be, but it would increase the workload.
 Overall thoughts / input on my plan?
  
Thanks in advance and have a nice week.

The offline one is completely dead everything locked which is wiped and reinstall. The other one my employee unplugged when it was "being infected" so only around 40% files locked. Personally i suspect its from phishing email or something, Our IT consultant (external, with us for about 10 years) says they could have somehow found out network vulnerability and hacked us. (which i find unbelievable). And he suggest us to upgrade both the servers and buy some other anti virus and such. amounting to around USD 10k each. (im not from US).
 I personally dont see how this can prevent the same thing to happen next time, but i do agree one of the server is quite old so could do some upgrade. just looking at other options here.
 i have read about synology or NAS or cloud stuff, in fact anything is welcomed as im not an IT guy. we have around 15 employees, max 20, usually all need to use the printers, server files and programme concurrently.

 I'm not very familiar with FMG, but was thinking about creating a new 6.0 adom and moving the devices there (or even the root adom) instead of deleting. Would that work? Also, what happens to the policy packages? Will they be moved along or do we have to move manually? Would moving policies from 5.4 adom to 6.0 adom screw with the objects?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 Hoping for a bit of help with this one as it's driving me crazy.
 I've got a handful of users whose laptop intermittenly will boot them off wifi, and take 1-3 minutes to be able to rejoin a wifi network. 
 This only occurs on the corporate network at the office, only on windows 11 computers (But not to all windows 11 computers).
 Wifi setup is some older Meraki mr18's (I know I want them upgraded, but budgets). I've been unable to replicate this on my own device.
 Wifi drivers are at latest, devices are 1-3 year old dell latitudes, win 11 at latest version.
 The only error that might be related that I can find in the logs is the below:
 The server could not bind to the transport \Device\NetBT_Tcpip_{7579EFB6-7F3D-4D48-B802-A9E2614865D9} because another computer on the network has the same name. The server could not start. 
 They seem to think that another device has the same hostname as them (Despite this 100% not being the case).
 No errors on the DHCP server.
 Issue does not appear when the laptops are connected to other external networks, IE Home, the coffee shop, etc
 I have been pulling my hair out about this for weeks and the best available on google is "It's a non issue it doesn't mean anything", "Turn off power saving on the device" (Didn't work), and other similar inneffective fixes. 
 I would love a second set of eyes, thanks in advance guys!

 We have an old IBM x3650 M1 (machine type: 7979, model: B7M) that’s just suddenly shuts down. Error from IMM says “Planar Voltage Channel Fault” though I can’t find any explanation/references from the web. Did any of you experienced this? Is there a possible fix other than moving to a new server?
 Thanks

Basic web links seem to work ok, but anything trying to redirect such as a teams meeting will trigger the "please enter the code we emailed you to enroll this device" routine for any unique meeting address. I saw some suggestions that disabling all the privacy/security features on the phones may resolve the issue, but it is not a great look to ask users to kneecap their own device security because we can't be bothered to fix our configuration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 So, long story short, I just started re-modeling network for one of customers and the problem is I need to put 12U of hardware to 9U cabinet…
 The easiest solution would be obviously to replace current cabinets with proper ones but as always there’s a caveat. They all are “build in” the walls. Recessed about 30cm and welded directly to metal construction of the building.
 Replacing them would be extremely difficult and expensive and would include painting all 4 offices…
 So my “standard” setup for each of them is
 24 port patch panel for fiber
 48 port patch panel for CCTV
 Two or three 48 port patch panels for regular network jacks 
 Aggregation switch for fiber that’s linking all 4 buildings and for all others switches from the cabinet
 Separate cctv switch that has its own fiber uplink to the main server room 
 Two or three switches for regular network 
 2U NVR for CCTV
 2U UPS also for CCTV
 it’s minimum of 12 and in the biggest building 14U
 Just writing that I realized that I could move all NVRs to the main server room, I don’t like having all eggs in one basket but that is kind of not much of a choice situation. But this is still at best 1U or 2U above my rack size.
 In all of that “desperation” I started thinking that maybe I could somehow secure UPS outside, to the bottom of the rack cabinet? OMG

I followed Microsoft's documentation and met all the specified requirements, but encountered a bug which prevented me from using Connect-IPPSSession.
 When running the command with a known-working app and certificate, I was given the modern auth user signing dialog. This didn't happen with the Connect-ExchangeOnline cmdlet. 
 After some frustration, I finally found a recent stackexchange post which described this issue, and provided a workaround. 
 The issue appears to be that the module assumes the existence of an environment variable that only exists in Powershell Core. The workaround is to manually provide that value in your script by adding this:
 $Global:IsWindows = $true
 I'm not sure how to report this bug to the correct team at Microsoft. It was reported in the Powershell github, but closed there.

I don't want to have to change the configuration throughout my environment if I decide to add a second destination or change MSSPs. I would like to have a single point of aggregation and distribution for my logs. 
 It appears using Windows Event Forwarder for my Windows systems and a syslog-ng system for everything else might work, but in both cases, it seems like there might be real-world issues as platforms may misinterpret the source for all events as being the two forwarders.
 Everything I find on this topic seems to be cover centralizing at one point, but nothing about then forwarding again. Maybe there is a good reason?

 I have a dual boot setup with 2 separate drives, as well as a storage drive. I would like to isolate the other main drive and storage drive from the current Windows 11 installation and set up a Local Group Policy to prevent drive attribute changes.
 I'm aware that it is possible to add a policy to prevent a user from accessing a drive in My Computer but the policy states that:
  
Also, this policy setting does not prevent users from using programs to access these drives or their contents. And, it does not prevent users from using the Disk Management snap-in to view or change drive characteristics. I'm also aware that an administrator can reverse these changes but I'm trying to make it difficult for a user without administrative rights to change these conditions.
  
Can someone help me please? Thank you.

This led me to write a book about it when many of the most common problems are addressed. As the introduction already implies, it is fairly impossible to cover all aspects of the entire linux storage stack, as the storage ecosystem is vast. Nevertheless, I do think it covers a lot of what you might/will encounter in your daily work.
 I don’t want to have this post to appear as a blunt commercial, as that is really not the intention

My bosses reasoning for this is that our firewall replaces the need for this? My logical reasoning says this is totally wrong. 
 Am I over thinking it? Just because we have a decent firewall doesn't mean we should be disabling other security measures that are there to protect us.

 Anybody has experience about upgrading Cisco SG550X-48 firmware? 
 I had many issues during the upgrading. I am using these switches in stacking mode with 2 or 3 stack members. I read that, these switches are upgradeable in stacking mode, so I don't need to upgrade that individually.
 There are my experiencies:
  
case
  
Last year I upgraded a stack with 3 members from 2.5.5.47 to 2.5.8.15. I uploaded the new fw via WebGui then rebooted the switch stack. After that the network is gone on these switches.
 The problem was that the switch config is modified during the upgrade. All settings on TenGigabitEhternet port is gone. Meanwhile I had problem with the switch password. I couldn't login with my previously used password, so I had to do a Password Recovery via console cable.

It doesent have to be fast, even 100mbit would be plenty since its just for the internet connection. Its a 70m run and i need to put it into the same conduit as the cables running from the solar panels to the power inverter. My first thought was to use a fiber optic cable, but i'd rather use cat 5e since its cheaper. Im going to connect the cable to a telekom speedport smart 4. 
 My questions now are:
  
Will the solar panel cables cause any interference, even if i use a shielded cable?
 Will i need to boost the signal with a switch or something?

 full disk Imaging is a potential solution but creates problems elsewhere in the chain.

 When someone logs in with an alias and tries to access the farm they get the error attached here.
 What I checked:
  
It happens randomly to people in the domain.
 
There are some that work great for them and some that work for him.
 
 In terms of comparisons between computers, I compared hardware, software, operating systems, versions, etc.
  
I checked logs on RDS itself and on the broker server.
  
The broker servers work in HA configuration.
  
I checked the correct settings of the alias.
 
I dug each and every post on Google and various forums!
 
 ​
 Facts about the environment:
 All 2019 operating systems, the most advanced versions of Windows 10.
 Defaulttsvurl is the alias definition in the RDS environment, and it worked fine until this issue occurred.
 ​
 I would appreciate your help because I can't quite find myself anymore.
 Thanks!

 In this case the only requirement is that the WAF service is operated by a European based company. The rest is probably more like, work with what you get. Since I don't expect the same type of services like Cloudflare where i can easily hook up an existing Terraform provider have the automation done within a few hours.

I am also attempting to do this without too much monitoring downtime and effort. My question is though, how would other recommend setting up data center monitoring? Should I break it into folders like servers, networking, environmental. Then break it down into domain controllers, specific app, firewalls, switches, UPS, ATS, Genset, etc. Or should I break it down into different VLANs/Networks so I can use the auto discover feature?
 ​
 What is other peoples recommendations when administrating a tool like this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone around here running racks of DL360 G10’s? We have a problem with them running hot, not internally, but more hot to touch. As in so hot they’ll burn your hand if you try to remove an SFP and hot enough to melt the labels on our fibers connected to them.
 We did note there is a vent on the top of the chassis but find it hard to believe this is related to cooling since the server is designed to be rack mounted on top of other servers without any spacing.
 This has caused some political issues with our site guys who are now insisting we space them out by 1RU which kinda defeats the purpose of purchasing a high density 1RU solution. Might as well go DL380 which is 2RU and get the extra storage capacity, but we want 1RU because our bottleneck is CPU cores.
 Anyone had any similar experience with these servers? HPE support were less than helpful lets just say.

(No, I haven't looked at Event logs to further understand why this is the case.)
 It's not my environment. Technically I may be able to access SCCM/MEM, perhaps create a special group for these older systems in order to deploy individual patches identified as being missing. Anyone else have ideas? Anything to beat remoting in.

 IDk exactly if this question is off topic or not but making it simple , here it goes like : 
 My company is running Cisco anyconnect servers + OpenConnect servers on some specific URLs with load balancing and different managements which non of them is making me a problem other than the network my clients are sitting in and the problem is that :
 I have multiple clients sitting behind a firewall that doesn't let them have access to OC/CA servers of that company on that specific port and URL but There is an other client(server) in this network that can pass this firewall without any problem and I can run my own domain on this client So the question will simply be what Kind of hardware or software do I need on that specific client to make a bridge into company's servers without extra routing, encryption/decryption and SSL certification ? Is HAProxy capable of doing this ? Do i need Remote SSL offloading ? 
 ​
 In other terms : Something like a Proxy that takes OpenConnect/Cisco requests from clients on the inside network and just forwards them to original servers without regulation ? I want Clients to not change anything other than the URL 
 ​
 And there are reasons why I want this scenario to be unchanged so please understand that I'm not looking for better ways of doing something like this but rather making this work

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm tasked with finding a UPS solution for our company's server rack. Adding up the servers' power consumption from what their PSUs are capable of I got to around 10kW. So this means with all servers at 100% load a minimum of 10kW is needed to supply enough power to keep the devices running. I figured, to be safe, I'd recommend getting UPS units totaling about 12kW to allow enough time for a graceful shutdown in case of a power outage.
 My coworker thinks this is overkill and he'd rather we get a UPS just big enough for our average daily load. It'd be more work to measure all our servers' power consumption but it'd save us money. He also believes we just need UPS to cover for power fluctuations and spikes.
 Is it feasible, if safe at all, to "skimp" on UPS like that? I'm not great at putting my thoughts on the table and my coworker has spent more time in the company than I did so if the answer to the previous question is no then I'll need convincing arguments.

But let me tell you, for my hypervisor in my home datacentre, I have continually had value in Proxmox VE in the 10 years I've been running and upgrading it.
 I started with Proxmox VE v2.3, 2x node cluster, which has expanded over time to 3x node cluster and upgraded over the literal decade to now v7.2-11. Same cluster, upgraded in-place. Earlier versions were a touch rocky to do major version upgrades on, but documentation was there, and I was able to get it sorted.
 Over the decade I've not only had performance improvements on the same hardware, but new features, and all sorts of great things. I update with some regularity (several times per year).
 I went to take a backup of my VM and found a feature suddenly there that I didn't know I needed. "Protected". I can take backups that don't get auto-pruned by my backup task! SO AWESOME!
 Also, Proxmox VE gave me an HTML5 local console to my VMs months/years before VMWare even had it, and Proxmox VE did it so much better (so much more responsive).
 And these are just some examples.
 So, I gotta say, fuckin'eh to the Proxmox VE devs! I don't know if you read this. But I tip my hat to all involved in the Proxmox VE development ecosystem. Thanks!

 We are currently prepping our first windows 11 image for rollout via Desktop Central and are having a ton of random issues.
 After deployment the OS will not open a ton of apps (no errors and no processes start) including settings, paint, ms store, notepad to name a few. This seems to be happening across any hardware we try it on. If I try to run settings via task manager I get an 'this app is not installed' prompt. 
 I've ran SFC, DISM, with no errors found / no improvement. I can't really get to much else to try to repair the install/apps either (settings is completely dead).
 It is worth noting that the current windows 11 version we have been testing with is Enterprise 22H2. We have tried fresh installs of 22H2, upgrading from windows 10 to windows 11 and running updates, as well as updating from 21H1 to 22H2. Due to the nature of the business/our security policy we can't deploy anything below the latest MS patched device even if the latest version is unstable (yeah idk).
 Any ideas/comments?
 ​
 TLDR: Does Windows 11 Suck or do I just suck? inb4 both.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We were switching out our 2901 router with a Fortigate firewall, all worked and had connectivity to all sites but we had one major problem. Our VOIP phones couldn’t get calls in or out. ISP says we have to have the router in place with the call manager, something with SIP trunk. I put the router back in and took out the fortigate. Looking to reconfigure the design, and the install the FG again. 
 I’m not a voice guy at all, like 0. What’s the best route here ? I was thinking out fortigate on edge and run FG < router < LAN.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 Trying to see if we can get some feedback on a problem we are experiencing in a site we recently took on. We had this problem almost daily around September where all inbound traffic would stop while all of our VPN tunnels stay up to our other 2 sites. When this happens bandwidth at the firewall on our WNA interface and our LAN interface is both minimal, 4-5 mbps if now lower. The problem disappeared till it started again a few days ago. The ISP says something on our end is maxing out their AdTran 5660 CPU causing it to start discarding packets. I feel like I should be able to see a spike on our firewall in traffic if we are in essence almost DOSing their router. We have mostly used Cisco Meraki and Fortinet in the past so Juniper is not our strong suit but from what I can tell they seem to be setup correctly to handle broadcast storms etc., but I could be missing something. Any suggestions on where I should start looking? 
 ​
 Some background on the site:
 Fortigate 400E firewall (handling DHCP)
 Juniper EX4600 Core fiber switch 
 Mix of EX 3400 and EX2300 switches throughout the site (around 25)
 Previous admins have the site setup flat with one large subnet (/20)
 Major things running on network are around 200 Hikvision cameras and 10 or so DVRS, around 100ish IP based clocks/speakers in rooms. 
 Site is running Ruckus APs and Zone Controller.

Things were good at first but having to drive around didn't cities to provide support for 30+ sites got old even though my schedule was pretty flexible with no one to directly report to in my immediate coverage area.
 Got tired of being away from home and felt like I also hit a ceiling as far as knowledge goes. The position focused very much on hardware over software and didn't feel like I could further advance my career by staying at current company.
 Fast forward to November 1st this year. I started a new position with a different company that has more of a focus on Windows products ( Windows Server, Office products, etc). The previous IT guy they had at the company unfortunately passed away back in June from cancer. With that he also left no documentation whatsoever when it came to passwords, credentials, anything for that matter. 
 Now I'm dealing with a Windows Server that is currently running on an evaluation version because they were attacked by Ransomware back in September which caused them to restore their server without a license I guess? They are also using a combination of Google docs and Office 2016.
 I've already bright these items up to the CFO who is my direct report and I don't think he understands the sense of urgency to have these items implemented

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for some feedback, and thoughts on how to be better at my job. I'm an Architecture / Engineering manager, in prior lives I've been in development, ops, infrastructure, data center, all at the same company. It's a really big environment, and I've gotten a reputation for understanding how most of it fits together.
 I've been a manager for about 3 years now, finally feel like I know what I'm doing, but mostly with a small team. I'm probably too hands on/ in the weeds, and I like to work on side projects still, but I get good feedback from my team, and boss/ peers. My team's going to double in a few weeks, and I've been a bit worried about coming off as a know-it-all, or a micromanager to the new folks. I try to be cognizant of setting a goal and letting the team figure out the best way to get there, but I definitely have opinions about how we should be building things.
 So, I guess my question is how do you prefer to interact with your boss, when they're not just the people manager? Do you like having them help figure things out, or would you rather they stay out of your way and let you come to them? Or those of you that are in this situation, how do you balance it?
 Hope that didn't come across too self centered, thanks for the consideration

 We encountered an issue where a customer was attempting to run an RFC 2544 test along a circuit we provide. The circuit will pass on all tests except for the small MTU sizes of 64 and 256. We see a drop in line rate on the throughput tests to about 750Mbps for 64 byte and 820Mbps for 256 byte.
 We are using the ASR 900 and ASR 920 routers for each end of this circuit. It’s a L2VPN point-to-point circuit designated at 1Gbps. 
 Has anyone else had any luck getting their RFC 2544 tests to pass with these routers at the lower MTU sizes? It seems like there could be a CPU limitation preventing these smaller sizes from achieving line rate throughput.
 Thanks for any help!

 I’ve got an issue I run into every month with a specific server when patching. When shutting down after the monthly CU has been prepared the server sits at Getting Windows ready… for anything up to a couple of hours.
 This is the only Server that does this.
 It has the following roles 
 AD Domain Controller File Services inc. deduplication 
 The server is a hyper-v virtual machine
 When I open resource monitor on the hyper-v host I can see a lot of disk activity, but oddly it’s on the vhd that acts as the storage location for the file services on the server. 
 There is approx 4TB of data, all small files.
 Can anyone advise why the update process seems to be so interested in that location? Is this normal from others experience of large file servers?
 Any insights much appreciated.

 Would it make a difference to start my robocopy job directly on the source server instead of an admin machine on the same network? When I start the job on my admin machine, would it be a additional hop (cache) for the files, so the copy would take longer?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for some level of understanding with Cisco Hyperflex. We will hopefully getting official training on it soon, but my team is being asked to take over a multi-site Hyperflex solution that was created by, well lets just call them non-IT people to be nice, and my first impression is that it wasn't built right. But they insist they followed all the Cisco recommendations. So I have some questions I'm hoping to figure out before I get called at 3am on a Saturday.
 First, the way these systems are configured is there is 6 VMware hosts, all with 6 SSDs in them, then the 7th server is the Hyperflex management server or something. Each server has a single NIC with 2 ports, 25Gbit, connected to two different switches. Those NICs are handling anything Hyperflex, VMware DRS, VMware Management, storage, and VM traffic itself. 
 Questions:
 1 - I've always gone with the school of thought that 1 single dual port NIC isn't very good for redundancy, but they insist this is the Cisco recommendation, are they really right?
 2 - I also would never shove everything through those two nics, is this also Cisco's recommendation?
 3 - The storage in VMware looks like iSCSI, but I haven't been able to get hands on. Where does the iSCSI adapters on the VMware host connect to as a SAN provider? Is it the management server? What happens when it crashes?
 4 - Is the Hyperflex storage like VSAN where there is a replication delay? if so, how long is that delay?
 5 - They told me DRS should be turned off for Hyperflex. Is that true? IF so, why?
 I guess open ended, is there any other tidbits of info you can supply me? Imagine that you are being asked to support a pair of these systems in different geographic locations, without ever seeing the damn thing ever.
 That's me

 ​
 What is the best practice for deploying a firewall for a CDN service hosted in on-prem DC?
 ​
 So, as we know, traffic in CDN networks is mostly outbound and the ratio can be 1:99, where only 1% are requests from the Internet to the CDN, and 99% are responses from the CDN to the Internet. On the one hand, we are obliged to use a firewall and requests from the Internet to the CDN service must pass through it. But should the return traffic go through the firewall? For example it might be possible that traffic from the Internet is only 1 Gbit/s, while outgoing traffic can reach hundreds of Gbit/s and it seems unreasonable to use firewall for outgoing traffic, because we trust our servers, plus we need a more expensive firewall. But on the other hand, if the return traffic won't pass through the firewall, the routing setup will be a bit tricky, plus we'll get asymmetric routing and so on...
 ​
 So, again:
 What is the best practice for deploying a firewall for a CDN service hosted on-prem DC?

 The end users had access to the contents on this vhdx which was mounted on one of the VMs from this ext HDD. I just can't see how that was possible considering hyper-v won't even boot a VM with this vhdx added, regardless it can't even be mounted to be explored.
 Is it possible to mount or attach a vhdx stored on a fat32 drive so we can explore the contents?

 So this week we suddenly had a load of users who all needed their account unlocked. Upon investigation what had happened was we had external attempts of multiple logins to azure ad power shell that had failed and triggered the lockout policy.
 The attempts were clearly scripted as we had hundreds in a matter of seconds, all from different countries. The logins have since died down.
 I could find a conditional access policy to specifically block Azure AD power shell but found a post where you can block all apps then allow all the apps you use. This makes me nervous so currently have it in report only mode.
 This got me thinking how easy it would be for a malicious actor to do a DOS attack on a company which could cause a real outage and if there is a true way to protect against these attacks?
 Any ideas?
 Thanks

 Within a few hours of opening a session in some cases we can see handle count for explorer.exe reaching 250,000+.
 Seeing it on mostly Windows 10 but also Server 2012 R2.
 When I run handle.exe tool it just has like 200,000 entries all in the root of the share and this is often without any applications running or files being opened (i.e. the share is just mapped/user has opened a connection to it at some point)
 Thought it might be AV or Windows Updates but have temporarily disabled AV and installed latest patches but problem still occurs.
 Not sure how to investigate why explorer is just continuously opening these handles and then proceeding to not close them/letting them just pile up. Thought it was a server issue but this is happening across multiple different SMB servers/independent storage systems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today I upgraded a JIRA app called BigPicture on our productive environment. I'm not a professional JIRA admin, but I do 1st and 2nd Level Support aside from my main tasks.
 The company paid around 6500 $ for the license for that app.
 By default, the app creates a database dump whenever you upgrade it.
 Cool, I thought. Upgraded it with few clicks. Closed the ticket – went on with my day thinking that it worked out fine. Nope. I received an E-Mail that the entire configuration from the users was gone.
 I looked into it and, yes, all the things that they were working on were gone. Communicated the situation to my other admin colleague and to the key users. Then I tried restoring the data from the database dump. This did not work because the database scheme has been upgraded as well, and we would have to revert the app to the older version to make the restore file compatible.
 So, I went into test environment, downloaded the older version of said app, installed it, but no. It did not downgrade. Apparently you'd have to uninstall the app first and then reinstall the older version. Sure thing, so I did just that (on the test environment) and tried to restore the backup there. Failed. Nothing happened when I click on the button to restore the data. And I also cannot restore the data on the test environment as the database dump only applies to the prod environment (due to the upgrade).
 Note that this is not the first time that this happened. We've had the same issue with this app around 1 month ago, where I created a ticket. Apparently it was a bug, which then got hotfixed. (We even tested it and it worked). But now we are back to where we've been in the beginning. I reopened the ticket, and I'm still waiting for feedback.
 Got a message that this issue has been perceived very negatively, and I understand. Now they want me to get the app working ASAP or I might get fired, but there's not much I can do.
 Yikes.

We have many branch locations that are fed by MPLS services with no current option to add local internet access. Our wireless is centralized and we have no appetite at this time to change to flex-connect. 
 So, knowing this, I’ve landed on a minimum bandwidth of approx 3.5Mbps per client. I haven’t nailed down the amount of clients yet but I have a method to figure that out. What I’m struggling with is how much oversubscription to go with. 2:1, 5:1, 20:1? Or any other insights you may have. This is a healthcare environment, so a large portion of our guests are transitory, but while they’re here we want a good experience. 
 Thoughts? Totally to open to suggestions.

 Earlier this year I shared an OpenSSL cheat sheet and it seems to have been received well by this community. I've made a few typo corrections and wanted to share the latest version.
 ==> OpenSSL Cheat Sheet v1.7 Direct Download <==
 The cheat sheet includes these commands and various flags/arguments and notes for how to use them:
  
openssl rsa
 openssl genrsa
 openssl dsa
 openssl gendsa
 openssl dsaparam
 openssl ec
 openssl ecparam
 openssl pkey
 openssl genpkey
 openssl x509
 openssl req
 openssl pkcs12
  
The most up to date version of this cheat sheet will always be available at pracnet.net/openssl, at the moment that is v1.7, so feel free to use the direct download link above. (no registration or e-mail sign ups required)
 The cheat sheet is a part of a course I teach on OpenSSL, and if you use OpenSSL for troubleshooting and inspecting SSL/TLS, you might want to consider the whole course. Since it's coming up on sale season I figured I'd also throw in 1000 free seats to the course on Udemy:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Evening fellow SysAdmins. We have been a long time GWorkspace customer and have been pretty happy overall. We now have to begin expanding our email retention and archiving requirements. Google has Vault with unlimited space and retrieval options for an add on. I've read pros/cons using Vault, compared to another 3rd party service, especially in how it performs and for lack of some features. It seems so much easier to get Vault and administer from the same "Dashboard" though rather than another service pooling all our email and using a side vendor. I was hoping follow members, either uses a service that works with Gmail very well, or their direct Vault product and what their take is on it. Thank you for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all!
 it is some kind of a theoretical unequal-cost load-balancing question.
 Let's imagine that we have two parallel connections between two routers 400M and 700M, or any unequal M:N ratio.
 What we have now for load both connections M:N ratio (let's forget about Mice and Elephant flows).
 E.g. if we have Cisco from both sides - we have an proprietary EIGRP for this, which does an excellent job with this.
 So question - what if we have two different vendors on different sides (or one non-Cisco)? 
 What options do we have? BGP + DMZ Bandwidth Community? Static M:N routes? Do we have another non-Cisco proprietary solution for this?
 Is there anything else?
 I will be glad for detailed answers with explanations, Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good afternoon,
 I work Helpdesk for a printer company and had an interesting situation that seems to be network related.
 The printer had a static IP, .0.24. I enabled DHCP, rebooted and it grabbed a 0.250 address (no APIPA). Also confirmed they were on the same Wi-Fi as the computer. The IP would not respond to pings and the UI was not reachable but the IP could be seen in an arp -a command. The MAC matched the printer. Typically, if you cannot ping it’s either on a different network or offline completely, and with this being visible in arp, a good Wi-Fi connection status and the printer rebooted, the only thing I could think would be to reboot the router. Any thoughts on what could cause this?
 Thanks very much!

I don’t ask people for free haircuts or to come clean my house for free. Why do they think they can just call or text me with their IT problem and expect me to give them an answer? I paid money and spent a lot of time to get my certs and education. My solution to this has been to tell people, “sure, I can take a look at that. My diagnosis fee is $50. I can’t guarantee I can fix it but I will take a look and we can go from there.” I actually just got my first client like this. It was meant as more of a deterrent but I got a client. Lol. Sorry for the rant. Just wanted to see what others think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I'm a SrNE for a global biotech company and we've been running approximately ~2k+ C9300s spanning the globe for a few years now. Over the last 3 months we've been experiencing complete failures at a very alarming rate. We're currently running IOS-XE v17.3.5.
 Switch failures have occurred for various reasons, entailing:
 - PoE capability of switch death (Non PSU related).
 - Switches experiencing faulty boot flash requiring more RMAs.
 - Switches randomly bricking with no lights whatsoever. Just a complete and total death.
 - Switches randomly bricking and giving "BOOT FAIL W" error on console and non-recoverable. Can't even access ROMMON. Validated via Cisco bugID CSCwb57624, but not recoverable via power cycle/reload as noted in Workaround: https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb57624
 Further, after our team pushed Cisco to how unacceptable this has been, they came back acknowledging a potentially faulty batch of many of our C9300s with corrupted DIMM.
 Guys... In my 15+ years of networking and having managed C3750/3850s for the majority of my career, I've never experienced or witnessed anything like this from Cisco.
 For years now, I haven't been fond of the direction Cisco has taken their Catalyst platform with moves like axing Catalyst IOS, consolidating IOS-XE to catalyst hardware, and their continued merakification of Catalyst which lacks the tight integration needed for rock-solid stability (IMO). 
 Cisco's moves have mostly felt more like cost-cutting measures than anything truly beneficial or innovative from an engineering standpoint. It's all giving me FirePower vibes which is why Palo is now dominating that market-space.
 Anyone else running C9300s in their environment at scale?
 Any failures?
 What software chain?
 I can't imagine our org is the only one experiencing this.

 Can this be done with something like NPS or FreeRadius? I've been checking documentation and I'm getting mixed signals on how easy this would be to configure with FreeRadius (seems like it doesn't play well with AD, requires Samba, etc.) and I have no experience with NPS, but the documentation seems pretty straightforward.
 Any recommendations on how to dynamically wireless users to specific VLANs via AD group/OU without paying out the ass for a NAC?

 I looked at the ticket history and sure enough, they did submit a ticket months ago. That ticket did include a domain and at that time the tech notes on the ticket were.
  
The domain resolves and opens on a few computers that I've confirmed access on. Please confirm that you've typed the domain name/website name properly. I am keeping the ticket open for a few days, please let me know when you are available to perform further testing from your machine/location.
  
The status on the ticket was changed to 'waiting for user response', which keeps the ticket open and informs the user at least once a day that a ticket requires their attention. It does this for 5 business days then closes the ticket if there is no reply from the user or if the tech doesn't modify the ticket in some other way.
 The user ignored the notes from the first ticket that 'they put in months ago' and I'm sure this user is bad mouthing IT. 'I can't get to this site, this is dumb, I already put in a ticket, they never help me!!!'

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quick background first - Got about 10 years of professional networking experience but I have NEVER touched proper enterprise grade cisco equipment. EVER. Mostly worked in places that couldn't afford or didn't need all those features and a new ISP that did a Juniper/Calix combo. FINALLY started working for an employer that has the scratch for Cisco with Palo Alto for Firewall.
 TL;DR: I'm very green on what Cisco hardware can and cannot do.
 We are getting tasked with stopping users from being able to communicate directly with each other within their same subnets. They only need to communicate with specific servers and cloud services.
 With Calix, I was able to use a protocol called Mac Forced Forwarding (MFF). In conjunction with DHCP Snooping and IP Source Verification, the switches forced all traffic to the gateway where a host was assigned via DHCP. My original thought was to use this and have the PaloAlto's regulate this traffic. Well to my surprise, these catalyst switches (9200, 9300 and 2960) do not have this feature. Seems to be limited to ISP grade switches.
 I tried using Switchport Protection (Private VLAN Edge) and this worked when the workstation where on the same switch. But it allows me to communicate to other workstations on other switches. While all of my access switches do trunk back 1-to-1 to the core switches. If I put those switch's uplinks into protected status as well, I might get what I need. Still "testing" this out. 
 I'm also looking at VACLs but I haven't fully grasped the cisco mapping features yet.
 Can anyone give me some suggestions on how to tackle this requirement?

 I think what I need to do is set all ports as Untagged for VLAN ID 1 and Tagged for VLAN ID 1003? This seems weird since I don't want to "tag" incoming traffic I just want it to pass through if already tagged. Is my understanding correct or should both VLAN ID be shown as Tagged?

 I recently added an ROA to try and reduce the risk of a BGP hijack of our prefix. Shortly after creating the ROA, the ISP stopped accepting our prefix and of course it dropped off the internet. The ISP wasn't able to give much information as to why this happened but by removing the ROA, it came back up soon after.
 I'm assuming what happened is, the ISP had a filter on their router which looked up the ROA for our advertised prefix, saw it originating from a private AS which didn't match the ROA and then dropped it. Would that be normal behavior for an ISP? Would they not trust the private AS as they were the ones who provided it to us in the first place?
 Or is using an ROA just not possible where the originating AS is a private one?
 We do have a public AS that was recently assigned but have not started using it just yet.

Is there a reasoning for this rather than just including the ISP gateway in the provided public IPs? We usually have a firewall at the edge but when provided with this ISP set up, we have to use a router to bridge the WAN and LAN. Just wondering if there is any reason behind this configuration?

 I'm a software engineer who came from a non software background and am in that "holy shit, computers and the internet are amazing, let's understand how the world works phase." I work for an awesome company that has networking problems and even though I don't work on that part, I do want to understand it thoroughly.
 Anyways, I am looking a for a book that's basically self contained/will give me enough information that I can read it and say "ok, I know how this works and can sort of make a mental model of it in my head." I tend to read books cover to cover/work through as many problems as I can along the way.Ideally I'll only need one book.
 Current recommendations/on my list are
 - Comer, Internetworking
 - Tannenbaum's Networking textbook - Networking a top down approach
 Thanks in advance for your advice

 example.com is the public domain, ad.example.com is the internal-only domain. Lookups to records under ad.example.com will succeed against the internal Samba domain controllers will succeed but will fail against public DNS servers.
 As we can see, a lookup for rt.example.com returns the CNAME, but then doesn't "follow up" to get the IP address, even though a lookup for rt73a.ad.example.com returns the IP address.
 The context is that I currently don't want rt.example.com to be accessible over the internet but I might want that in future. Was hoping to be able to that without requiring a change of URL used to access it.
 Is DNS supposed to behave how it's behaving for me, or is there some setting I need to change to get the behaviour I want?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are replacing the old DCs in our organisation for cyber security which has made us create new print servers. All the printers are installed and work from the servers in the configuration we want, using dns for port names etc.
 Now because of print nightmare we are trying a work around to install the printer drivers via intune and then a login script to map the printers after the drivers are installed.
 Here comes the issue, we have noticed that all of the printers with v4 drivers are being installed with MS point and print driver. The printer with v3 drivers are installing with their appropriate drivers.
 We have found that some of the V4 drivers are not installing, so adding that to the driver install script, removing and re-running the login mapping script, it still adds the printers with point and print. 2 of these are for the main office and need user preferences enabled so they can select trays etc. But point and print doesn't enable that. Without that we cannot shut off the old DCs.
 Now we don't want to disable the print nightmare registry key or amend it to a state where it is not 1 as this will be picked up in the cyber security audit in March 2023. I am at a loss as to what I can do to bypass this issue. It seems odd that all websites on the Internet state V4 is the answer to fixing it but V4 is causing the problem.
 At the moment we cannot move to a driverless system as we need to get new printer contracts first.
 TLDR; printers with V4 drivers are shown installed with point and print and is not suitable for our environment.

AppLocker is set to block anything to do with OneDrive, however it keeps getting reinstalled during every monthly patch. As far as I know, its not a requirement for any other apps and we have already been blocking it for a few month. 
 What this ends up doing is making is users constantly see "blocked by admin" and error messages. This does not effect functionality but it causes an uproar from users.
 My suggested solution is to disable OneDrive usage via Group policy but actually "allow OneDrive" via AppLocker to prevent these messages. 
 Is there anything Security/STIG related that makes my idea sound like a bad one? For reference this is the policy I want to enable.

 Was wondering if anyone on this forum could shed a light on a strange issue I'm seeing on a network. 
 I have a VRF (all configured correctly as reachability to other subnet across the MPLS are reachable fine) presented on a port facing a host (windows laptop) the IP facing this host is:
 192.168.0.1/24 
 The host laptop is on:
 192.168.0.2/24
 I can ping the laptop fine sourcing the gateway interface on the router and the host can ping the gateway, however it is unable to ping other hosts inside the VRF on other sites (the laptop can ping the gateway to these other sites just nothing sat behind the gateway). 
 To remove any possibility of it being an MPLS issue I created a loopback interface on the router where the above 192.168.0.0/24 subnet sits: 
 Loopback100
 10.10.10.10/32 
 I still cannot ping the host 192.168.0.5 sourcing this loopback. I instantly assumed the host default gateway was wrong as I could ping directly connected but no further, however the hosts address/subnet mask and default gateway are 100% correct.
 ​
 Was wondering if anyone had a similar issue, the router is question is a Cisco ISR 1100.

 I'm not versed in the ways of the sysadmin but i have to work with daily users fixing little and larger stuff (Helpdesk).
 I like my job but i don't know what to do anymore for a specific individual. 
 This person is paranoid, delusional and thinks the entire world is following her and changing stuff behind her back.
 It started years ago, she claimed her skype account got hacked multiple times, she couldn't reset the password since she never got the reset mails.
 Turns out her recovery address was a gmail address and she never cleaned that up so the mailbox was full.
 She doesn't want to clean it up so she can never reset any service she claims has been blocked or hacked that is connected to her gmail address.
 This person does not accept nor want to hear any rational explanation.
 She claims all her phones, laptops (private and work) are being monitored and things "change" the next time she logs on to any device.
 For years we ran scans with antivirus, antimalwares etc ... nothing is ever found except some harmless cookies.
 We can never verify if anything she claims is true since the "present situation" cannot be compared to the "previous situation" since all files are always locally on her laptop or at home or anywhere else where we have no backups.
 Finally we got her to place some documents on our internal network drives with the specific question to only follow what happens to these files while she works on them. (She really didn't want to put them on the network) This way at least i can look into the backups to see what has changed. But even that doesn't prove anything.
 What would you do so you could "prove" that either she changed something or at least see what changed and by whom ?
 This person can tie you up for hours and days complaining we don't do enough to find the culprit on her work pc and i don't know anymore what i could do to help her.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All
 Further to my post about using Azure/365 non licensed users. I am wondering if there is also a 3rd party provider that can link to various identity providers to be the single source of identity so we can then point SSO/Saml config from the various saas provders instead of azure.
 A comment has been made, that they want to keep out tenant as clean as possible, eg only users with licenses and have access to company resources and equipment to reduce risk. This will likely be 300 users in next few years. But overall staff could be 5000+. Of the 5000+ , they wont have email acct, nor equipment but do need access to like HR Saas portals etc.
 Personally, I think its going to be cheaper to just give everyone a basic 365 license that inc some form of email and can control the MFA part of the identity provider. But business wants alternatives as they know as soon as I enable email, I will be going, headocount, headcount (not that I said I can turn the email part off).
 I am thinking like of Okta etc but wanted ot ask here first.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking at other threads on here about other VPN hardware providers and I've heard a general concensus of Cisco anyconnect and Palo's global protect. As being great options 
 There's only a few concerns/requirements I'm looking for.
  
Pre-windows login auth to domain servers for new user authentication
 Saved credentials that can be used with said pre-windows login
 And multiple gateway options for fail over to redundant ISPs
  
For requirement #1,2 we have a few branch offices with a decent amount of turn over so new users are always signing in and out of the domain'd pc so a saved set of VPN credentials that user's can't see and don't need to be reentered for an employee to authenticate to the DC to is a must
 We currently use Watchguard fireboxes with IPsec clients as they allow prelogin auth with saved creditials, but my only gripe is that the VPN client doesn't allow for multiple gateway options with out making a new profile, that users have to swap to and sign in again on. (The VPN client has to swap gateways on its own as I don't trust my users to toggle to the back up, and to toggle back to the primary when connection is stable again.) 
 I'm hesitant at the Cisco option as I don't have much Cisco CLI expertise.
 We have about 25-35 VPN endpoints at any given time. 
 We are a full windows org and only IT uses VPN on phones (mainly to just test if the VPN connection is working)

 I have found that i need to identify and exclude any onedrive shortcuts in all users onedrives as well as:
 1 prevent them being moved via robocopy (we are lifting and shifting all onedrive content into a "documents" folder for each user)
 2 prevent any files being moved from users homedrives going in to any onedrive shortcuts folders, this is to prevent personal files being uploaded to SP or a Teams SP site. (Happened in testing...)
 Currently I have a robocopy to do a move (it's more complex than this example) :
 Onedrive root -> Onedrive\Documents Hdrive -> onedrive\Documents
 Issue being folders are merged and onedrive shortcuts will upload content to whatever sites they are part of.
 This is a task set out as we can not use the provided onedrive migration tools due to some clash with known folder redirection and pther issues that i wasnt part of initially. 
 Any ideas? Or am I over complicating things.
 I have created a complicated powershell script so far that does alot of prechecks (network,diskspace,homedrive space required, etc) but this actual lift and shift part just gets more complicated when I look into the nitty grity bits.

Since i’m relying on Aruba to host my customer websites and email server (talking about imap/pop ofc), i would like to move to a vps to increase the income and to simplify my management work. I started looking at OVH but i need a “lot” of storage because my customers want a lot of GB per email address and on OVH to obtain more than 160gb i need to pay for the 8core/8gb ram vps that i don’t need (i can’t consider the option to add a secondary partition because cpanel can’t officially store email on another partition). So i started looking at A2Hosting, the “Lift 16 Vps” makes more sense for me since it has 450gb storage so i can fulfill the customer needings about email capacity. The exchange server is not a viable option due to costs. I would like to hear opinions about a2hosting, if someone has better ideas than mine and if cpanel has some sort of problems on multi-hosting that i didn’t consider. Thanks in advice

 I am working as an MSP for Small Businesses (<10 employees). None of our Customers have Services that are available through port forwarding nor do they use VPN connections. They have a proper professional Endpoint Security Solution (with Firewall) installed on every device.
 Now to my question: Does it make sense to deploy a "Next-Gen Firewall" into their network? I don't really see any benefit they would get out of an expensive Firewall compared to say a small MikroTik Router doing NAT (properly configured of course, VLANS etc.) . I heard that all those fancy things like Deep Packet inspection come with their own Downsides that i would rather not deal with. (And my Endpoint Security Solution supposedly does the same thing but right on every device with little to no configuration)
 Do you think the added Security weighs out the cost of buying, monitoring and maintaining a Firewall for such a business?
 I personally would think the money is better spent on awareness trainings for the employees than on such a device. 
 What are your thoughts?

 Other problem that happened is that if I installed the printer first in one user the error 0x000002e4 comes up, but if I login with Admin and install it, and then login with the user and install it, there is no error.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I want to test my Samsung SATA drives since some of them cause trouble when recording large video files over time, causing drop frames. Seems to be due to the SSD not being able to keep up the pace. I know the usual suspects like Samsung Macigian, Crystal Disk, Smartmontools, etc. 
 But it seems none of them gives me a comfortable way of dealing with slowly degrading disks of different types and vendors. Do I really have to go into the specific SMART attributes and check on the significance of each one of them, also having to monitor them changing over time? 
 For ex. my not so good old 840 Pro (256GB) passes all tests and currently gives me 56 CRC errors and 5216 wear leveling count. I also suspect that any kind of bad sector checks also don't really work with SSDs as they trim the bad cells away!?

 If not then does anyone have any suggestions how to identify the traffic across a multi vender OS estate? I would've considered a GPO to tag it with the correct tag if it was an all Windows estate but since MAC and Android are involved to, I was hoping Teams already pre tagged in traffic.
 We use Meraki MR46 access points and there is no option to build a custom rule based on source ip address annoyingly to as I know Teams has a predefined source port range it uses across the board

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm looking at implementing wireless QOS across our wireless estate.
 With this mainly comes the need to prioritise Microsoft Teams traffic over anything else first and foremost.
 I have read a few Meraki and 3rd party posts/blogs on setting it up with no real answer to this question...
 Do the default rules (or custom ones for that matter) shape traffic themselves on the AP's or are they only a means of tagging certain traffic with the correct QoS tag?
 The reason I think the AP's might arrange traffic and shape it themselves is because the option to "Shape this traffic" is there on the default and custom rules to.
 I haven't really been able to find an answer to this.
 Our link speed bandwidth across this new site we are building is more than enough! But since there are going to be a lot of people wirelessly "hot desking", wireless will be even more prioritised than wired. With that comes a need to make sure all the AP's prioritise traffic such as Teams (mainly) etc... over others like YouTube etc... 
 If the default rules do shape traffic on the AP's into low/high priority queues behind the scenes then they will be enough for what I'm looking for here given that the default tags from Meraki seem to be correct across the board for things like VOIP and Teams etc...

Usually we test circuits and such with iperf, but I was thinking it may be useful to setup a html5 speed test server on each of our datacenters that users and clients could be directed to with a url link. Opera would still be used for when we need to test isolated links. But for initial testing, it would be much easier than walking clients through iperf. 
 This isn't something I want internet facing or anything, just for internal testing to our datacenters. 
 Has any one set something up like this in an enterprise setting? I see open speed test as an open source solution. But curious about potential security concerns because we would have to get it past security obviously. 
 Just looking to see if others have done something like this and what recommendations people may have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone else or just me? The amount of trouble and drama that these cause me is unreal at times. Absolutely hate the things!
 In an environment where your place cannot ship goods without the printed labels, it is a bit of a showstopper!
 We use Zebra printers at site, quite a number of them, printing various labels from SAP, so they often have to be specific printers for each label type. These are types such as 110Xi4's, 220Xi4's, ZD500's and ZT610's. 
 A long while back, I made some suggestions around purchasing maintenance for them but this cost and idea wasn't being entertained. So at the time, looked at purchase a spare of each printer type so in the event of failure, we can roll out a new printer immediately, minimising disruption and downtime. We went with this idea and knowing it could be months before replacement printer would arrive as lead times are about 3 months now. Obviously this was long ago now and spare is in use. 
 So today, printer seems to have a mechanical fault, is out of warranty and Zebra don't really want to know. I'd sent them a video displaying fault and they now recognise it as being mechanical fault and needs a visit, but they ask me to contact a partner for this!
 Being the only IT guy about the place, this ultimately falls to me. I'm an IT guy yes, but I am not a printer engineer. We have our limits but it doesn't half stress me out when these things go down.
 It honestly felt as though I was doing same thing over and over again with the printer and expecting a different result. I also find printers the most mundane sort of things to be dealing with which I suppose doesn't help!

My HR Dept is tasking me with reaching out to the termed employee and coordinating the return of equipment. I dont feel like it should be IT's responsibility. I do believe that I should provide the list of equipment but not be the means of recovering it. I am curious on everyone's thoughts and what procedures you all might have in place for this.
 Edit: I would like to thank everyone for your feedback. A little more background here, small IT Dept, I am a lone Sysadmin with one tech support rep. We have a company of about 225 employees and I report directly to the COO. I posted here because I keep getting put in situations of having to deal first hand with termed employees. And of recent I was put in a situation to meet up with a termed employee at our offices on a Saturday when no one is there. I have drawn the line here and documented my concerns in an email to HR and management. Thanks for the reassurance that I am making the right decision here stepping up to management.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for an MSP and I am fairly new to my role. I have a head on my shoulders to not do something like this.
 A client has a server that was setup about a year ago. I was working on the server recently to install a TPM chip to have BitLocker setup and come to my surprise; I didn't see a RAID controller; and then I went into Disk Management and confirmed my suspicion. 
 Disk 1: 500 GB: for OS
 Disk 2: 2TB (Spanned) for DATA Drive
 Disk 3: 2TB (Spanned) for DATA Drive
 Disk 4: 2TB (Spanned) for DATA Drive
 Disk 5: 2TB Unused (Empty) 
 https://imgur.com/a/Y46NSS7
 Server is PowerEdge R540 128 GB Memory / Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4214 CPU @ 2.20GHz 
 Client has about 7 VMs being ran on this span of 3 hard drives. Fortunately all together the total amount of data being used is just a bit over 1 TB and we have Offsite backups running. Client doesn't know this yet. 
 I want to look into getting a hard RAID Controller for the server and get RAID setup. Should I go for a RAID 5 and move the DATA off the D: Drive to the unused Disk on DISK 5? Or setup the server to do have a RAID 10 configuration for the DATA Drive?
 Also it bothers me that the OS is just sitting on a single drive with no redundancy as well. I was thinking of doing a RAID 1 for that.
 How would you go through and handle this issue and prevent as minimum downtime as possible to get this s*** fixed?

 I am using an old switch to practice a few things on first, so that I dont screw up production.
 So with that said, I pulled an old Dell N2024P switch out of the closet, flashed the latest firmware, and did the following which seems to have worked in terms of setting up a management VLAN. What I did:
  
Add VLAN 10 called "Mgmt"
 Assigned IP address 10.11.10.6 /24 to the VLAN 10 interface.
 Removed the IP address from the default VLAN 1 interface
 Marked ports 1-23 untagged VLAN 1, marked port 24 untagged VLAN 10.
  
So with that, I now can only access the management interface for the switch by plugging into port 24 and assigning a 10.11.10.X /24 IP to my network adapter. Great, this is fun…]]></summary>

Obviously NBAR and some traffic shaping would be an easy fix but I’m convinced our company leadership has compromising photos of our department head and when the higher ups complain about the quality of their video stream, he will pass the problem onto us to implement some sort of solution.
 Currently our internet link utilization averages around 75-80% and we just use QoS to ensure critical traffic is guaranteed bandwidth when there is congestion. Increasing the capacity of our pipe isn’t an option and we’ve tried for years to alter our network acceptable use policy(people LOVE to buy switches on amazon and plug it into both wall jacks in their office). 
 Any recommendation regarding how I can manage this upcoming problem? I’m assuming that we’re not the only team with this issue particularly South Americans who also have to deal with the time difference and beloved sporting event happening during work hours.

 Is this viable? Or would it be seen in a negative light by employers, having all these "career breaks"? The way some people make it sound is if there is a 1-month gap in your resume, questions start being asked. 
 I appreciate any feedback! I feel like I need a change from the normal work lifestyle of indefinite mon-fri 10 hour days for the next 30 years until I retire. Contracting seems like it could be a good way to keep things fresh, experience different infrastructures and learn new skills. And generally seems to be better pay, I'd likely earn the same if not more even with the time off.

 One of the company I work for would like to test some chassis before deployment. They can recover some parts from a partner venture (ISP) before purchase a batch of those.
 Initial config would go as follow:
 ASR-9006-AC-V2 (2 fans, 3 pwrs both V2)
 2x A9K-RSP880-LT-SE
 2x A9K-8X100GE-SE
 Beside common BGP, OSPF they need to be capable of :
  
Multicast Routing Protocols (PIM, IGMP)
 Security package (SSH, SSL)
 SSO-NSF, FHRP, LACP, BFD
 MPLS (Traffic Engineering, Layer 3 VPN including VRFs, RSVP, EVCs, Layer2VPN, EVPN)
  
For what I can read online, I don't understand what difference is between A9K-RSP880-LT-SE and A9K-RSP880-SE is there any limitation to the LT version?
 Also I can read that we would need to buy some licensing for VRF which is this A9K-800G-AIP-SE.
 Is there anything else that would be required in order to make this work?
 Obviously I could go and ask Cisco but I already know I would only receive a explainer with a BOM for ASR99XX which we are not interested in currently.
 If anyone is an expert, I would glady listen to advice.
 Thanks in advance.

 The implementation is across two physical Locations where one is a giant freezer and the other is an Ambient Warehouse. The AP's in each area are in their own AP Group and Flexconnect Group. 
 The issue right now is when handheld devices are in the Freezer they have no signal.
 From what I can tell when testing signal on site. My laptop stays connected to the Ambient Warehouse when inside the Freezer. All the strongest signals I see when standing in the freezer are from the Ambient Warehouse AP's and very bad signal from some of the AP's in the Freezer.
 The AP's in each area are different models. C9115AXI-E and AIR-CAP1532E-A-K9. A 3rd party designed and configured this solution, and I am lining them up for a troubleshooting session.

 Has anyone got any recommendation on what I need to be looking at?

 Currently we don't and I have no problem with it, but my boss is annoyed some people ask for headset when they might have had one already.
 My thought is maybe some kind of Microsoft form and some how targeting new hires with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, first post on here but I have utilized this subs info for quite some time.
 To paint the general picture. I recently started a new position and found myself needing to assign some of our available static IPs for new security cameras that were being installed. This led me to the IP spreadsheet that the company utilizes. I know that this is not uncommon, but I have never encountered one so inaccurate/outdated. A few basic NMAP scans showed just how bad it is.. but not to derail, I got approval to begin purging and updating the spreadsheets.
 My current process (only testing atm, I have not begun updating the spreadsheet) is an NMAP scan: nmap -sn -PR and: nmap -sn -PS. I also run a scan through the IP Address Management tool in the Solarwinds toolkit that the company utilizes. Finally, I will ping the IP from the local switch itself (if applicable).
 I know this technique is redundant and most likely not the most effective method. Thus, before I begin, I was hoping to gather any suggestions or techniques that others may use to ensure that an IP address is not in use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an FYI post. For the last 2-3 weeks we have been having intermittent flapping of connectivity within our Meraki AutoVPN network. We have 4 offices in a mesh topology. The event logs on our MX firewall would show entries for 'VPN Tunnel Connectivity Change' and 'connectivity: false' while specifying the peer losing connectivity. It seemed to happen on the hour, and last about 5 minutes. Ping attempts during that time would timeout between offices. However, normal internet access was not affected - only the VPN tunnels. So what was the cause? After working with a couple of engineers at Meraki support, some suggested firmware upgrades and rollbacks (to no avail), we requested an escalation of the issue. After some analysis on their end, they discovered that the VPN Registry servers we were using were very busy. They changed our primary and secondary VPN registry servers. Since then, no more issues. Hoping this post will save someone some time in the future.

 After Reading microsoft's documentation, i'm a little lost.

So, everything is saying I will find a redirect to a redirect xml. I am seeing a list of words with the names of the discovery items and 0 as the dword value. The list contains autodiscover-s.outlook.com, and our owa, which isn't reachable at the time. This is the first time I have seen -s. My DNS is a CName: Audotdiscover that leads to autodiscover.outlook.com. 
 How do I change these settings globally? Should I change this? Is this even a problem? Do you have additional resources/information? I know OWA is unreachable, and that might be causing some of this problem. 
 Thank you for any information you can help with.

 AIR-CT5520-K9
 Mix of Cisco 3800/9120 APs.
 I was looking at the WLC and saw a few potential settings to modify to improve client connectivity. The building itself has a pretty good density of APs (over 90) and we do not want to or think adding more is the correct solution to fighting concrete everywhere.
  
Want to change client roaming aggressiveness under Wireless ----> 802.11a/n/ac/ax to a minimum RRSI threshold of -80.
 Changing RF profiles specifically for this building.
  
Any thoughts or tips you guys have used in the past for this type of environment?

 We have all Dells and some desperately needed updates, this script does that and even changes the bios password if a existing one is already applied. Obviously this can all be changed to fit your needs.
 The regkey adds and take aways in the scripts are because that how we know if something is install or found in intune.
 This also takes away Dell bloatware. All in all im proud of it, took a while to fine tune it but it can always be improved. Just thought Id share.
 There is a Install, Uninstall, and detection script so it wont install on machines that arent Dells.

Now, it seems, in the corporate space, due to the appeal of Microsoft's vast product suite, most companies have moved or will be moving to Microsoft 365. Question: Is this setup healthy?

 Cyber security is often very dry, confusing, and uninteresting to the average user. Ninjio has training which I think is informative, entertaining, and easy to digest. 
 Since we've started using them, our security instances have gone way down. 
 Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hey i was wondering today why the private ip spaces are exactly e.g. 10.x.x.x or 192.x.x.x etc. instead of e.g. 1.x.x.x and then up to say 3.x.x.x. I didn't find anything right away, but maybe someone here knows. 
 ​
 And also another question about this. What other IP spaces are there? I know about 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12 and 192.168.0.0/16. But I also know that there are spaces like 0.0.0.0/0 and 255.x.x.x/x.

Their main SSL certificate expired 4 days ago. Tried to create an account to reduce the amount of captchas to fill for unblocking while handling a range of IPs that seems to have gotten a few IPs blacklisted there for some reason, the confirmation email required to activate the account never arrives (which makes sense if they use the certificate on their SMTP, providers would likely reject email from a server with an expired cert). And when using their contact form to let them know i get the very helpful response of:
  
An Error Occurred!
 Error:
  
And nothing else. 
 So, if anyone has an alternative way to nudge those people to go and fix their SSL, please do so. In the meanwhile i guess it's captchas time...

 My problem is that I have racked my brain over a user issue which I cannot seem to solve using the obvious means and after lots of research online. What's worse is that the user is already pushing hard and escalates things with our manager (yes he works in the it department as well).
 My question is whether it's ok or not to admit that I don't know how to resolute an issue, especially after exhausting all options I can think of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On all our administrative GUIs (VMware vCenter, Storage Systems, Back-up solutions, SAN management, iDRACs, Container Environment), we configure AD authentication together with basic (local) authentication. This basic authentication is used as a 'workaround' in case AD would be unaccessible, or someone messes up the AD binding, or makes a change on AD level.
 While there are already cases where we had to use the local user, it poses a huge security risk since these are static credentials and there is no policy in place to rotate them. 
 How do you guys approach this? I'm aware Microsoft doesn't recommend password rotation anymore and instead advices to use MFA together with long/complex passwords. I assume this is not possible with basic authentication? Would you disable basic authentication completely? What happened where you than were lock-out because of an underlying AD issue?

 as it is now I log in as a standard user to my desktop. For any type of desktop elevation I need to perform, I use my la_first initial last name account. If I need to log into the file server for example, I use my ja_first initial last name account to log into any server BUT the file server and jump to the file server using admin share to do what I need to do. Create a folder, permissions, etc. 
 So that’s 3 accounts I have. Well my boss has only recently started practicing separation of duties and we are looking at ways we can standardize this for both of us. I’ve just been recently promoted to a Jr. Sys admin and am going to be given more access to servers. 
 How do you handle this in your org?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just wasted an entire morning understanding why a static source directory was apparently changing files, only to realise Robocopy may be reporting the summary wrong.
 Each time I run a threaded command like...
 robocopy \\source\folder \\destination\folder /MIR /MT:32 /Z 
 ... on the same location I get a summary report each time with differing file counts and sizes.
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Total Copied Skipped Mismatch FAILED Extras Dirs : 547 547 547 0 0 0 Files : 1353316 0 1353513 0 0 0 Bytes : 699.840 g 0 700.014 g 0 0 0 Times : 0:00:09 0:00:00 0:00:00 0:00:09 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Total Copied Skipped Mismatch FAILED Extras Dirs : 547 547 383 0 0 0 Files : 1356866 501237 855802 0 0 0 Bytes : 693.333 g 34.89 m 693.693 g 0 0 0 Times : 12:12:38 0:39:56 0:00:00 0:02:27 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Total Copied Skipped Mismatch FAILED Extras Dirs : 547 547 547 0 0 0 Files : 1353619 0 1353787 0 0 0 Bytes : 698.507 g 0 698.686 g 0 0 0 Times : 0:00:36 0:00:00 0:00:00 0:00:36 
 ​
 But running it standard (without the threaded switch)...
 robocopy \\source\folder \\destination\folder /MIR /Z 
 ...I get the same, correct result every time.
 ​
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Total Copied Skipped Mismatch FAILED Extras Dirs : 547 0 547 0 0 0 Files : 1370293 0 1370293 0 0 0 Bytes : 707.611 g 0 707.611 g 0 0 0 Times : 0:08:38 0:00:00 0:00:00 0:08:38 
 The threaded command copies the files fine (when I check manually), but I need to prove the results after and the summary suggests an incomplete copy.
 The threaded command is wicked fast compared to the normal way, but I'm having to run a slow /L after the fact just to prove the file counts match.
 ​
 Has anyone else experienced this? Am I just doing something wrong?

I am peering with my RP via bgp on the edge of my network, a direct connect, that router is configured to accept multicast now but due to an oddity I have a switch next. So it is foreign RP, router, switch1, firewall, switch2, multicast clients.
 For the switch1 how would you all handle it? Would you turn on layer 3 and route multicast between the router and firewall or just extend a vlan between the two.

 I was thinking to go for professional version but I’m not entirely sure whether it will cause any legal/license issues to me later on since my professional version will be for Personal use.
 I asked company IT team and they said as long as it doesn’t prompt local admin credentials to be entered, I can use it. 
 Some clarity would be helpful here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there anyone here who has experience using Snipe-IT that can advise on its capability for tracking a large volume of repairs and RMAs?
 For a Little context, we currently use an out dated system that was developed in house to manage movement of assets(we provide retailers with IT hardware and often install loan equipment while we repair or obtain replacement equipment for the customer). We recently won a contract to distribute specialized network switches nationally but the catch is that we now directly take over the warranties and our current system is not suitable for the now large amount of RMAs we have to process and track. I have been asked to evaluate Snipe-IT as an alternative system before we spend a small fortune developing new Asset Management Software.
 I have played around with the demo and while It will easily address most of our needs the only way I can see us using it to track assets that have come back for an RMA is by creating a new status or duplicating a location and adding a suffix (example, having "Location A" and "Location A-RMA area"). However, due to their high volume, we want to treat the faulty switches as an entirely separate beast, in order to make end of month reporting easier.

 ​
 I face an issue in my network environment, the detail is as following:
 We have 2 ISP with the IP's (example) below :
 ISP 1: 103.45.24.0/24
 ISP 2: 203.17.25.0/24
 ​
 here is our brief environment: https://ibb.co/gv36xDx
 ​
 There is requirement from my manager whether is it possible, if we have app publish to internet where if the IP public from ISP 1 (103.45.24.0/24) - dnat to - Web Server is down or fail then the IP (103.45.24.0/24) failover to ISP 2. Otherwise, if IP Public ISP 2 down or fail then the IP failover to ISP 1 ?
 ​
 I have searched and still looking for anything about BGP who explain this explicitly but still have no clue how to configure it.
 ​
 I have basic knowledge in networking and make use GNS3 for lab and prove of concept before going into production.
 ​
 If there is a paid course or anything in particular or video tutorial that i can follow.
 I would like to take and pay for it.
 ​
 Really appreciate anyone who look into this.

 ​
 We have a few hundred notebooks and (Mini-)PCs in our company, and a few months ago it seems Microsoft introduced a (or a few) very, VERY annoying bug(s) when it comes to mainly DisplayPort connected screens... things still worked pretty much without issues, so I (we) suspect a random Windows Update as the culprit by this point.
 ​
 People have called many, MANY times by now about (but not only) ...
 ... flickering displays
 ... screens that randomly turn black mid working, yet Windows still sees them as connected so it suddenly becomes a "ghost display"
 ... random colors flickering
 ... screens not waking up once it went into Standby
 ... weird resolution issues when using Display to DVI adapters
 ... and so on...
 ​
 I am... really at my end here and so is the rest of our IT team. This doesn't just happen on notebooks, this also happens on Mini- and normal full size PCs, it doesn't matter what graphics card even. This happens on Intel... NVidia... AMD... and so far this almost exclusively is happening on DisplayPort connected screens. Almost all of those displays don't have HDMI tho, or if they have most of the Docking Stations only have one HDMI out.
 So yeah, just a little rant about this...

But I've never used/managed ADFS before, nor MS Dynamics 365 CRM. I walk through MS documents, get the certs setup for ADFS and get the Relying Party Trusts working again. I get certs renewed in the 365 Deployment Manager. Updated the CRM IIS bindings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm pretty experienced with Varnish and VCL (sysadmin 2 years), but this seems to be an uncommon case because of a couple of factors.
 I have a new hitch/varnish server running as a remote caching proxy serving a node.js backend halfway across the Internet. The backend is serving HTTP on 9801 but is also serving websockets on port 3000. A user visiting the site enters the domain https://foo.com, gets taken to the varnish box and views the site, where the site javascript then tells it to connect to websockets on wss://foo.tld:3000, but it can't connect. There are lots of solutions for setups where varnish is running on the same localhost as the backend that it's serving, but this one seems to be a problem. My VCL includes the standard req.http.upgrade -> return pipe with the connect headers copied, and it worked with our previous frontend proxy that was on a different CDN, and I suspect the old CDN was playing a part in making the websocket connections work.
 How do I get varnish to pick up the client connection for WSS on 3000 and pass it transparently back and forth to a remote backend that is running WS also on 3000? There's so many possible factors at play that I'm a bit lost. All replies appreciated.

 Now, he has some Ethernet-capable CNC machines and a monitoring device (from Chatter), and the monitoring service told him to set up VLANs. So, he asked me to set up VLANs.
 I go out, set up VLANs as follows:
  
192.168.10.0/24 -> VLAN 0 (default, original)
 192.168.20.0/24 -> VLAN 20 for CNCs
 192.168.30.0/24 -> VLAN 30 for Wifi
  
For the machines, we set static IPs since he uploads designs to the machines via FTP and he types in the IP address directly. Fine, good.
 I set the CNCs' static IPs as:
  
192.168.20.11 (later)
 192.168.20.12
  
VLAN 20 DHCP range is 192.168.20.101 to 192.168.20.200 to reserve the lower range for static IPs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been testing Juniper Access switches and Mist wired assurance recently. I have gone through testing all the features we require (802.1x, dhcp security, voice vlans and qos, switch stacking, etc) and it seems to check all the boxes. Mist is missing a few knobs, but we can accomplish these through CLI templates. What is everyone's recent experience, specifically around ex4400 and potentially ex4100? We use MX routers and have had very good success with these. We also have been deploying Mist wireless with good success. My main concern is code and hardware reliability.

I'm making a completely fresh AD/AAD environment for fun, trying to mirror our current hybrid environment, and want to make sure I do it as cleanly and future-proofed as possible. It's going to be my personal test environment, I'm hoping it can save me some trouble in the future since half the time there seems to be some little bug or security hardening that sneaks through unnoticed (or undocumented) for monthly patching. Plus it's a fun project in general, I always end up taking jobs where it's all set up already, never got to try making my own environment fully from scratch. So far I'm just building lots of Server 2022 VMs in Hyper-V on a spare laptop and using a free Azure account to see how far I can get, going to be a long road ahead to get everything like our work environment but hopefully will learn a lot.

 I admit I’m not the best manager I’m a systems engineer who got thrown into management. I let the get away with a lot to try and avoid conflict. One day I got fed and told them no more games, no more messing around at work, and started opening tickets up for everything. I really turned up the heat. I ended our 2 day remote policy.
 The help desk guys started dropping like flies and quit with out having another job. I’ve re-hired new help desk guys and 6 months later they are the most efficient group ever and the company is even giving them a raise due to the hard work they put in.
 I learned my lesson as a new manager. I’m so happy that everything ended up okay.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So may be a dumb topic, by hey nothing gained if nothing ventured.
 So I pass CCNA last year in January which been sitting on collecting dust since I been focus on RHCSA which finally passed yesterday. So I realize I should look into ways on how to renew it. I think Continuing education credits would be the quickest but also going for CCNP would work as well.
 with the later however, it meant to go more in depth on networking which would be interesting. only problem why I'm a little hesitant is from a Odem book I had some time ago certain topics in the early chapter mention technology which was cisco exclusive. I mean that expected since its is Cisco lol, but reason CCNA get respect is that it try to stay as foundational as possible.
 So I want to ask anyone who made a jump to 301 to ENCORE (which I gather the most congruent pathway) just how similar are they in term of concepts. like a 20% differences, & if so are said differences more Cisco's exclusives protocols and such?
 P.S if anyone know where to find learning material which just touch the new stuff. pretty please let I know!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve recently come into the position of being the IT admin for a small video company with existing IT infrastructure and could use some help recovering a VPN that’s stopped working some time in the last 2 weeks. Now when trying to connect — all our VPN clients run macOS Ventura or Monterey — I instantly receive the following error message:
  
VPN Connection
 The L2TP-VPN server did not respond. Try reconnecting. If the problem continues, verify your settings and contact your Administrator.
  
I’ve observed the same error message on both macOS versions mentioned.
 The public IP doesn’t respond to ping — which I know doesn’t necessarily mean anything other than all the ports on the router are stealthed, which is fine from a security standpoint — although all other network resources (authentication, NAS access, internet access from the inside) are working just fine.
 The network runs on:
  
A Ubiquiti UniFi USG-PRO-4 firewall
 A Ubiquiti UniFi Switch 48 US-48-500W PoE switch
 A Ubiquiti UniFi Cloud Key Gen 2 UCK-62 controller
 A Dell PowerEdge T320 running Windows Server 2012
  
I reached out to the previous IT guy, but he’s incommunicado. Then I found some Windows Server updates pending … those’ll get installed tonight.
 Any help, even diagnosing from first steps would be greatly appreciated!

 And so here I am, asking this community for your thoughts, feelings, experiences with the multitude of products out there. I don't have any preferences (paid vs. open source, etc); I'm just genuinely interested in your reviews and recommendations before diving into any number of free trials and getting talked up by sales folks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been in my current role nearly 10 years, and to be honest for the most part I really enjoy it. They've been pretty lacking in pay raises and bonuses though, and when a former colleague set me up with an interview, I took it - my first interview in 10 years.
 It went well, and they made me an offer which is nearly 35% above my current salary. Obviously it's an incredible offer, and I'm delighted to get it. My boss says that he wants to make me a similar offer, but it's going through the quagmire of the company HR department and nothing concrete has materialised after about a week. The new company needs to know by the end of this week whether I'm accepting.
 Not counting new job fear (in which I hope I'm not alone, and everyone here has from time to time!), the big thing for me is that company policy says I'd need to be in the office at least 2 days a week. I currently do the majority of drop offs and pick ups for my little girl (who's 3), which is possible due to my WFH schedule. The commute to the new job would be about 40 minutes each way, so days that I worked, I wouldn't be able to do the nursery run.
 My new prospective boss says that in his team, he's super open to being flexible with WFH, so it may not even be this much. I'm just.... Hesitant. I know that it's because of my WFH lifestyle that I'm used to - I guess I'm just wondering, how do I get over this fear? Have any of you made a similar transition?

 Currently have a small network with a single ISP line. We are adding another ISP with matching address space. Our address spaces are from the provider and are too small to advertise with BGP. 
 Outbound traffic seems pretty easy and lots of options with FHRP/track objects/route maps/etc but was wondering about inbound traffic. We have an authoritative DNS server being hosted on-prem. Wondering if I could add multiple glue records with each provider's address and have multiple host records to allow inbound traffic to failover.
 Also wondering the pros/cons of using VRRP vs track objects and a floating static route. Have labbed the scenario just having a floating static on the main provider tied to a track object and having the secondary provider router inject a default route into OSPF. If the primary goes down then the static will be replaced by the OSPF learned route.

We have no security posture and whenever I mention security it is treated like it’s working against the company. As with many companies security is an after thought which is then ignored. As I have a life I’ve stopped working late to support the company because I need to have a work life a balance. 
 Development of course has many people many devops engineers but there is no infosec, CTO, CIO, Tech lead or anyone of the sort.
 P.S I know quitting is a good move considering I care more about the company than the owners but I want to see if I can find a way to get a managerial promotion and if I can save this ship. I’ll probably be leaving anyways.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm looking to get rid of a Fast Ethernet Bridge that links two nearby office buildings. I would replace it with an SFP Module that plugs directly into the main switches in each building. That said I want to make sure I get the right module.
 From what I see, we have a black (Multi Mode?) run that runs underground into each building. From there it goes into a beige box with multiple jacks. The beige junction box then connects to a Fast Ethernet Bridge using a Fiber Patch Cable.
 I'm not sure if you can tell from the picture but I'm pretty sure I need a MultiMode SFP Module for both of my switches. Any clarification\correction on the correct module would be appreciated.

 Sorry for a probably very novice question. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: How do you use REST APIs to improve your monitoring abilities?
  
With the increase of focus on DevOps has led to performing many actions and automated tasks with APIs! You can write a script that performs actions on a device or group of devices, and make intelligent decisions based on the CRUD responses. 
 What about for network monitoring? API calls to devices can obtain much of the same information, if not more detailed information than SNMP MIBs can get - but how could they be worked into an operations environment? 
 Most environments, mine included, have a number of monitoring tools. We use a combination of SolarWinds, DNA centre, Intermapper, and a few other methods. These systems poll devices every second (or several seconds) for new data. This is no different than the request/response format which would occur for API calls. 
  
 Are there tools built to utilize API calls to network devices? 
  Have any of you ever built a custom web application specifically to display their desired information in specific ways? I'm not an application or web developer by any means, so I can't speak to the complexity for a task like this, but I'm more looking into the need for something like this if there are existing commercial tools that do this already.

 In my company, we are supporting many remote office locations. A common complaint is to see that wireless or wired network speeds are slow (most engineers will be familiar with same). 
 Just wondering, what tools/apps you use to document and test network speeds in a global network environment?
 I am thinking of a way to benchmark network performance. i.e get an onsite contact to run a series of test on LAN/WLAN etc and to document the results versus what the expected results should be.
 This can then be used as the benchmark when future issues are raised to help understand if the speeds are compromised, links saturated or other IT issue etc
 Any suggestions on tools or similar processes or any thoughts in general?

From mid-June through mid-July 2022, CISA conducted an incident response engagement at a Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) organization where CISA observed suspected advanced persistent threat (APT) activity. In the course of incident response activities, CISA determined that cyber threat actors exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability in an unpatched VMware Horizon server, installed XMRig crypto mining software, moved laterally to the domain controller (DC), compromised credentials, and then implanted Ngrok reverse proxies on several hosts to maintain persistence.

 Does anyone know of a set of Visio stencils (preferably vendor-agnostic) containing pretty much all conceivable switch sizes - 8, 12, 16, and so on - with anchor points on each port? 
 I'm putting together some Visio diagrams of an existing network we'll be taking over. It's an absolute rat's nest, and we're likely going to tear it all out regardless.. but I'd like to write an as-built that encapsulates Layer 1, and review it with outgoing IT to make sure our cutover plan captures everything.
 edit: Guys, respectfully, I'm not looking for pointers on network documentation. This is a unique situation necessitating this visualization, and I'm just asking if anyone's aware of a stencil set that might help accommodate it.

 The scenario is a disaster happens at the primary site. Everybody needs to login at the secondary site. (different FW, different VPN). We disable the IPSEC tunnel and we disable the FW policies between the two sites to simulate the disaster at the primary site. Everything works and is tested.
 I was just wondering what would happen when the DC in the secondary site can't reach the DC's in the primary site and vice versa. What would happen if there are some actions to be done at the DC in the secondary site during the business continuity test, like password resets, GPO changes etc. Will the changes sync without issues to the DC's at the primary site when the connection is restored? Not planning on doing modifications though, just in case. 
 No Active Directory Sites & Services configured, I know, it's on the todo list :)

        <updated>2022-11-16T14:07:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning,
 I am having an issue with my native VLAN assignment for some reason and I am not sure why. I am very new to Aruba but worked with Cisco for a few years and most recently Alcatel-Lucent (unfortunately). The issue that I seem to be having is that at my branch location I have a newly deployed Aruba 6100 that sits in the IDF and connects via SM fiber back to the MDF. I have been using VLAN 100 for my native VLAN and my networking equipment all lives in that subnet. On the MDF side, I have my VLAN assignments set up like this
 BR-44-MDF> show vlan members port 1/1/49
 vlan type status
 100 default forwarding
 112 qtagged forwarding
 164 qtagged forwarding
 184 qtagged forwarding
 188 qtagged forwarding
 601 qtagged forwarding
 When I set my native VLAN on the Aruba switch trunk to match the MDF I lose connection to the switch and have to wait for the checkpoint to revert my changes back to the native VLAN being 1 before I can access the switch again. My trunk interface on the Aruba side is set up with 
 Native VLAN: 1
 Allowed VLAN List: 1,100,112,164,188
 I also noticed that the Aruba switch VLAN 1 is pulling a DHCP address in the same subnet as my VLAN 100 address which surprised me that it didn't throw an error for overlapping subnets. 
 BR-44-IDF# show ip interface brief
 Interface IP Address Interface Status
 vlan1 10.1.94.21/25up/up
 vlan100 10.1.94.125/25up/up
 I am not sure if I am missing something silly that I need to do in order to stop this behavior and have the VLAN 100 act as the native VLAN with a static IP instead of VLAN 1 with its DHCP-assigned IP. Any help in finding the piece I am missing would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have been looking into upgrading our systems from RC4 encryption to AES-256. The first time I turned it on it broke everything. DC's couldn't talk to each other at all. It was my first truly oh shit moment. Took down the company for 3 hours. Today I got sometime to go back and start looking at the issue . The password for the krbtgt account has not been reset in about 8 years. When I run the klist command it shows AES-256 connection from and to every machine I have looked at. The only exceptions is the krbtgt and our QNAP device. QNAP will be something I look at afterwards. We have an old one and are talking about replacing it the first of the year so I don't want to spend too much time there. Anyhow, my thinking is it is still using RC4 because that was the last time the account had its password reset and to move it up to AES-256 the password needs to be reset. 
 ​
 Can anyone confirm if my thinking is right?
 I've been told by multiple people that resetting the password for the krbtgt account has not caused any problems. Has anyone had any issues with this?

 Sorry for this rant. It just annoys me that i need to have 10 different spares instead of a single standardised one.

 Our tools are showing "brute force attack" alerts because thousands of accounts in AD are being locked out. And i'm talking sometimes a dozen lockouts per account per day. 
 But here's the kicker - we have no login failures. So there are no failed logins at all for 99% of the affected accounts. 
 We have no idea what is triggering the account lockouts. The source of the account lockouts is showing a web server we use for the website, so we were considering whether its AD-integrated web server which is causing the issue, but its also showing thousands of account lockouts originating from dozens of other assets/servers in the network. 
 We have a decent sized team looking at it but we're coming up with nothing. 
 Any ideas here?

 I wanted to send notifications from Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows.
 I created a new azure user ie.: [Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com).
 I added this user to the group which exclude the user from any Conditional Access settings.
 I created NewSMTPBasic authentication policy (AllowBasicAuthSmtp true) and assigned it to the user
 I setup SmtpClientAuthenticationDisabled : False 
 My settings of Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows are 
 smtp server: smtp.office365.com
 email: [Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com)
 port: 587
 SSL/TLS: Yes
 user to authenticate: [Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com)
 Password: password of [Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com) 
 My problem is that it works only with above settings. If I want to change email address to any email like: [djwheele@domain.com](mailto:djwheele@domain.com), [anymail@domain.com](mailto:anymail@domain.com), any existing users in our domain it doesn't work. 
 Did You ever had similar issue? Can You help me to solve it? Why I can send emails only to the user who is used to authenticate on smtp.office365.com ???? 
 Thank You in advance.

 Im trying to connect a copper SFP 10G (from Mikrotik) to a stacked C9300 to a DELL switch (that also supports 10Gb) but there is no link between them. I've tried different ethernet cables but no success. I tried the same ethernet cable to connect between two regular 1G copper port and it works so nothing wrong on the cable (it is a CAT6 cable). 
 I also tried to connect the copper SFP between the stacked switches (I connected one copper SFP in one port on the master switch and one copper SFP in the slave switch and connected an ethernet cable between them) and still no success, but Im not sure if you could do these tests between stacked switches.
 Either way, I also checked if that the interfaces are not in shutdown mode or err-disabled mode.
 I configured the "service unsupported-transceiver" to see if that will change anything but no success. 
 The setup I have is a stacked 9300 (two switches) and plugged in two copper SFPs, one in the master switch and one in the slave switch that goes to a dell switch so I can form a LACP between the stacked C9300 and the dell switch.
 Appreciate any help.

 I'm currently reworking our corporation's wifi and I've got EAP-TLS working, however I want to permit only a specific group of users from our local AD.
 I've got the CA up and running and publishing certificates all around to the computers (old setup) and I've got the ruleset for EAP-TLS working with GPO on the Windows domain computers.
 My problem now is that I need to permit access only to a specific group in AD as the ruleset just points to users/domain computers so everyone with a domain computer gets access.
 Once a user who's not in the group logs on I want the authentication to fail.
 I've tried adding /users/domain computers AND /group/ as a requirement in the auth policy, but the group I added in ISE External Identity Source/groups doesn't show up in the policy. I also removed a few groups and it doesn't seem to update in the policy set or the condition library.
 Is this a known bug in ISE 3.1?
 I need the computers to log in to the wireless prior to actually logging into the computer so it can reach the DC for login, then drop out of the user is not in the specific Security Group.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies if this is the wrong place to be asking this question, but it is my first time seeing this issue before thought I would try my luck here.
 We have an on-prem environment using a local domain - just a standard dc server with AD and a RDS server - User1 is already logged on to the RDS server. Then User2 comes in to start their day logs into a Windows 10 PC which is domain joined and receives "Welcome User1" in the windows login greeting and User1 is then disconnected from their RDS session and User2 has actually loaded User1's profile - desktop icons and all.
 Any ideas what may be causing this, I have tried the following:
 -Removed User1 and User2's profiles from the Windows 10 PC and then re-added only User2 back on to the device but the issue is still occurring - User 1 no longer uses the Windows 10 PC just works on the RDS.
 -Removed the Windows 10 PC from the domain and re-joined to the domain. The RDS server itself is new only a month or two old has been happening ever since the RDS server was setup I was informed.
 any further suggestions on what else we can try here? - getting close to the too much time wasted - blow away windows and reinstall and see if it happens again.

 We can't use our teams account to skype to them but we also can't create a "personal" skype account beceause we have teams accounts...
 i would like to prevent to have users create skype accounts with their personal emails... how can i create a "personal" skype account with a "business" email adress.
 (FYI: Skype is still beeing heavily used at our suppliers)
 Thank you for the input and feedback!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Dear Subreddit, 
 I need to migrate a IPSEC Tunnel from a Sophos UTM to a Fortigate 200F.
 Remote Gateway is a Checkpoint Firewall. So far so good. 
 Now I face 33(!) SA's which are established on the Sophos. Let me point you a picture:
 Sophos : Site A
 Checkpoint: Site B
 ​
 Site A got following Networks:
 192.168.105.0/24
 192.168.100.0/22
 and a Host 192.168.40.100/32 
 ​
 Site B:
 10.3.0.0/24
 10.2.0.0/24
 10.1.0.0/24
 10.1.7.0/24
 10.1.4.0/24
 10.1.6.0/24
 10.1.2.0/24
 10.1.1.0/24
 10.1.8.0/24
 10.1.5.0/24
 10.1.3.0/24
 ​
 I'd love to do SNAT on Site B, but I've never done that on Checkpoint. I know on FortiGate we can use 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 and let the Policies do the Denying. Is there a way to do that on Checkpoint or how would you go about this problem ?

 But recently a loophole was discovered - on Android phones at least, users have the ability to trick the system by enabling desktop mode and then logging in through 2 factor.
 This is possible because getting into email by 2 factor through personal computers is allowed. But we don't want people on their phones doing it, otherwise what's the point of using an MDM? This loophole was discovered only on Android but it's possible it exists on iPhones too.

 I am trying to have traffic come into the LAN ports on the router and then get routed to my sperate internal network.
 The static routing doesn't seem to be working. All of the LAN cables have to be plugged into the PR-600MI and there is no way around that aspect.
 I'm trying to fix the internal routing as the solution.
 PR-600mi network: 192.168.1.1/24 Linksys velop network: 10.10.10.1/24
 I had the Linksys velop on the 192 network but the pr600 was blackholing all dhcp requests and wouldn't work.
 Tried changing it to a different subnet but now the pr600 won't route to the 10.10 no matter what I do, including static routes.
 Does anyone have any experience with velop ? Maybe it is a Linksys side issue?

 If you click the returned website on the left it correctly goes to the site. Ping the address and it returns the correct IP as recorded in the ICANN lookup.

 I am trying to do redirection using iptables. The number one problem is that local connections do not go through the PREROUTING chain in nat. I also suspect that they bypass the nat table altogether because none of the connections are reaching my rules in nat. 
 Is it possible to redirect traffic from the filter table instead of the nat table? 
 Before I started, I was worried about redirect loops but now I'll be happy if I get a redirect loop.

 I was recently hired to a small company as the sole IT guy. I've had about two years of non-traditional Helpdesk experience at a different company handling their proprietary machines and software.
 The company I'm at now has about ~60 devices exclusively on MAC OS and no MDM, administrative directory or cybersecurity solutions in place. They want me to come up with a solution for phishing and other threats. I did some research on MDMs like Jamf Pro in conjunction with Apple Business Manager. I've also looked a bit at Barracuda for phishing. I've figured an MDM would be a good starting point but apparently need a strong knowledge-base to implement (lest I break something) along with some scripting.
 I'm honestly not really sure what direction to go in. Any resources for learning how to implement an MDM for Mac OS if this is the best route? Other suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I work for an MSSP and we have a customer sending Meraki logs to our SIEM - they have enabled FLOWS, which results in a "flow" type as well as a "ip_flow_start" and "ip_flow_end". The flow log contains more data than the start and end logs - it has the mac of the source, the outcome (allow or block)
 As far as I can tell, the only value of the start and end logs are calculating the elapsed time of a flow. However, there is no unique field that ties the two together, only the source and destination IP and port. 
 I don't think the SIEM has any rules that rely on the calculation of flow length - so I figured I should just turn these off to save the customer some $ on data ingestion costs.
 Has anyone ever disabled just the flow start/end logs? In the interface there is only the Flows role. Googling this tells me the customer may need to engage Cisco support in order to do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone! I posted about this a couple months ago when I was trying to get the hardware, but now that I've had everything in my hands and have been trying to work with it, I'm stuck. I've literally been trying for 2 months. We currently have 2 TRENDnet TFC-110 MSTs that link our two buildings together using fiber. With the help of some others on Reddit, I purchased these two items (https://www.fs.com/products/11774.html and https://www.fs.com/products/43465.html). I got 3 of each to have backups in case one went bad. My Unifi switches recognize both SFP modules, but I cannot get the two switches to talk to each other with the fiber line that works just fine with the TRENDnet modules. Does anyone have ideas? I've tried everything I know (switching the fiber connections, restarting switches, changing cables/modules) and I'm stumped. Thanks!

 Now, this hasn't always been going on, and I'm not entirely sure what changed to make it begin popping up, but it's causing a lot of issues with our AnyConnect Management Tunnel connections, as the mgmt tunnel will not even attempt to connect if the credentials prompt is up. Once you "x" out of the prompt, the mgmt tunnel connects immediately.
 Has anyone else run into this?

 I'm a one man show. I do have the support of a MSP available and their usage approved, but is that additional expense warranted? It's a small company but I'm managing their entire tech stack. So far I haven't used the MSP for the help desk. Should I start?

 We have some later generation Extreme BOSS switches with multi-link trunking or MLT downstream to some VMWare ESXi servers. We have four links from the switch to one of our servers for instance.
 Are we supposed to ONLY configure trunks (no other LAG/LACP/MLT) downstream to these hypervisors? I noticed we have an exponential amount of broadcasts coming in from these MLT downstream switchports.
 IE on Cisco: conf t int fa0/1 switchport trunk encap dot1q switchport mode trunk
 We don't have a distributed vSwitch connecting to these switches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a self-serving post where I am patting my own back, but I don't care. I'm happy.
 We rate people on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the highest. Once a manager rates their employees, they need to justify the rating to senior management, who almost always challenge the rating, especially when it's a 4 or a 5. So, my manager is meeting with senior management and tells them he's giving me a 5, and they just say "We're good with that. Who's next."
 After that, he tells me what an outstanding job I do. How my troubleshooting skills are god-tier, at times. How somehow I seem to be available 24x7, and on and on.
 Honestly, I don't think I am all that exceptional. I MIGHT spend 15-20 minutes after hours responding to emails from people. And I usually stay VPNed in till the VPN times out at 8:00 PM and kicks me off. If someone needs something done and it takes 5 minutes, I just go do it, because I am already VPNed in and I don't want to deal with it in the morning.
 So, in a month, I don't work that much overtime. But when I am sitting in bed and watching something on my iPad and I see an email pop up where someone is asking for something simple, I'll just reply and tell them I can deal with it in the morning.
 So, this really is the ILLUSION of putting in an insane amount of after hours work. When it's really just me responding to an email now and then. As an old boss told me: carry your Blackberry on you at all times (this was the 2000s). 99% of the time, you'll never be bothered. But that one time someone calls you and you answer, you're everyone's hero. And they'll remember you're the guy who answered the phone when there was a problem.
 It's good to be recognized sometimes.

It is now unreliable and I need a replacement suggestion. Would like to go for 10G copper even though we have nothing with 10G just to be prepared. $2k budget each, 16 port or more. Nothing fancy. Don't need managed/L3/redundant PSU/etc. Max switching traffic at full load would be 2Gbps/ea but backups never run during business hours so it's unrealistic.
 I dug around for a bit. Is the Aruba 1960 any good for light iSCSI?

 I've been googling around searching for what would be the most practical solution to monitor our 6 /24 segments but I haven't found a definite answer. (We're a new and kinda small ISP).
 I've already set up a remote server that is monitoring these segments with Smokeping, but now we need a way to monitor them locally.
 I haven't found any info indicating that you can configure Smokeping to use a different interface or to ping with all interfaces, so, the faster solution would be to set up one Smokeping instance per each of our segments?
 Does anyone know a tool or service that could do this?
 Sorry if my English is a bit clunky, it is not my first language.
 Thanks in advance!
 EDIT: I just need basic ping and packet loss monitoring, like ping to Google, AWS, Netflix, Facebook, etc.
 nothing more at the moment.

 According to the article, someone 'high up' clicked on a bad link and it led to everything from their backups to payroll, scheduling, inventory, ordering and many other systems all being compromised. They also lost patient pharmaceutical info to the attackers.
 For this to be true it means a number of the most basic industry standard security practices were not followed, like:
  
MFA/Conditional access on remote access to email, VPN, RDP, etc...
 No separation of regular user accounts from admin, server and domain admin accounts
 Backups not immutable or air gapped
 Likely no 'next gen' firewall UTM monitoring internal servers
  
It also just seems crazy to me that so many systems could be accessible from a single user credential. This is a company that had $30 billion+ in sales last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been having a problem with Azure Virtual WAN routing and was hoping somebody might have some insight. I also posted to /r/Azure but did not get any replies.
 For testing, I have created a network described by the network diagram at https://imgur.com/a/Yf0INds . In my scenario, I am creating a traffic flow from VNet_1 to 10.200.0.10. BGP is used between the VPN Branches and the VirtualHubs.
  
At first, the traffic flow uses path 1. This is expected.
 If path 1 becomes unavailable then the traffic flow uses path 2. This is expected.
 If path 1 recovers then the traffic flow continues to use path 2. This is not expected.
  
My expectations are mostly based on the routing scenarios from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/about-virtual-hub-routing-preference . My understanding is that path 1 should always be preferred if it is available because the Virtual Hub will prefer a directly connected route over a route from a remote hub. I would at least expect the routing decision to be deterministic.

 I am wondering if there is best practice when it comes to firewall deployment or is it whatever makes sense to you.
 For much smaller deployments, such as an office with 100 users or less, to me, it makes sense to just terminate on the firewall but then again im not concerned so much about the inter-vlan traffic and the firewall policies are a bit more lax compared to a datacenter rollout.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for advice on how to resolve this dilemma, and thought it best to include a diagram that shows the current topology:
 https://i.imgur.com/Id3NwcL.png
 I recently added a second nexus to our core. For WAN connectivity, we have one MPLS link from the carrier plugged into the original Nexus. This nexus is learning the BGP routes from our remote sites just fine.
 The second Nexus, however, is not. Instead, it is learning the routes from the firewall via OSPF, as each site has a VPN tunnel to the firewall as a backup WAN connection.
 Is it possible for nexus2 to receieve the BGP routes from nexus1 in the short term? Ideally, we would get a second drop from the carrier to have an uplink in nexus2, and they could also establish it as a bgp peer.
 Otherwise, what are my options?
 I could add static routes for each remote subnet on nexus2, but that doesn't seem ideal, either.
 Right now, the bgp config on nexus1 is as follows:
 router bgp 999 address-family ipv4 unicast network 10.1.16.0/24 redistribute direct route-map allow redistribute ospf 1 route-map MPLS neighbor 10.1.99.2 remote-as 99 address-family ipv4 unicast soft-reconfiguration inbound always 
 And Nexus2, I configured bgp in case I ever needed to physically move the MPLS cable over.
 router bgp 999 address-family ipv4 unicast network 10.1.16.0/16 redistribute direct route-map allow redistribute ospf 1 route-map MPLS neighbor 10.1.99.2 remote-as 99 update-source Vlan999 address-family ipv4 unicast prefix-list no-default-route in router ospf 1 redistribute bgp 999 route-map MPLS passive-interface default redistribute ospf 1 route-map MPLS route-map MPLS permit 10 match route-type external internal

My ticket was migrating our email gateway away from going through Sophos Security to now use native Defender for Office because we upgraded our MS365 License. Ok cool. I change the MX Records in our multiple DNS Providers, Change TXT Records at our SPF tool, great. Now Email shouldn't go through Sophos anymore. Send a test mail from my private Gmail to all our domains, all arrive, check message trace, good, no sign of going through Sophos. 
 Now im deleting our domains in Sophos, delete the Message Flow Rule, delete the Sophos Apps in AAD. Everything seems to work. Four hours later, I'm testing around with OME encryption rules and send an email from the domain to my private Gmail. Nothing arrives. Fuck. 
 I tested external -> internal and internal -> internal, but didn't test internal-> external. Message trace reveals it still goes through the Sophos Connector, which I forgot to delete, that is pointing now into nothing. 
 Deleted the connector, it's working now. Used Message trace to find all mails in our Org that didn't go through and individually PMed them telling them to send it again. It was a virtual walk of shame. Hope I'm not getting fired.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right now we have identified many different scripting/coding methods being used to automate processes like reporting, database updates, account modifications, SharePoint updates, and much more. Things like PowerShell (.ps1), Batch files (.bat/.cmd), Shell scripts (.sh), Perl scripts (.pl), Autohotkey scripts (.ahk), Python (.py), complex Excel/Access creations, SharePoint forms/automations, and custom executables from god knows where (.exe).
 Everyone who came before was handed multiple jobs to complete, as their peers left the company. And they managed to do it. They automated it to make it possible. But then they were poorly compensated. No raises, or even pay cuts. CEO makes 2 mil, yet they get dropped from 100k to 70k to make it happen. So they left. Now the company is relying on this automation, but it keeps breaking. Nobody has expertise to deal with so many different cobbled together pieces. They basically eliminated 20+ jobs through automation, then let the people behind all this stuff walk. We're not even sure which servers it's all running on (dozens of them at least).
 Any recommendations for dealing with this stuff (other than leaving)?
 Any tools that can log all of this, and try to map out what everything is doing, and on what servers?

 I'm currently just messing around with some network traffic of an infusion pump and it's connection with the online configurator. The two are exchanging their communication via TCP. 
 I also did a vulnerability scan using GVM/OpenVAS and found out that the infusion pump is using an old/deprecated version of TLS (version 1.0).
 Now the data that is being exchanged is send in plain text (also a lot of sensitive data) despite TLS.
 I'm kinda new to networking and the whole security aspect that does with it so excuse my ignorance. However, shouldn't the data be encrypted in some sort because of the TLS that is implemented? The way i understand TLS is that the data is being encrypted right before it is being send over the TCP-Stream and then again decrypted at the destination.
 ​
 Any help is greatly appreciated.

All of a sudden last week something changed and our users are having difficulties logging in. They are getting all kinds of TLS and connection refused errors. It works intermittently but when they are able to log in, page elements don't load, it says quotes are submitted when they actually aren't.
 It's extremely old obviously, it can only run in edge on compatibility mode now, it was originally designed for Internet explorer. The kicker is that there's been no maintenance paid on this and it cannot be updated without that maintenance, and the person who created it left the company 10 years before I joined. I asked around and there's nobody that supports this app nor has there been anybody since the man who created it left supporting it.
 Now I have procurement beating down my door in a panic because nobody can do what they need to do. I told them I have no knowledge of this and that the solution is to cough up the maintenance to get this working but I was told that isn't an option. My job duties do not include application support. I am a systems administrator. 
 I'm all for helping out where I can but what do I do?

 Recently I created a link aggregation group consisting of two ports. According to the docs, VLANs should be assigned only to the master port, but what about access lists? Should they also be assigned only to the master port or to both the slave and the master?

 Is there a way to sign subdomains as well with the same key?
 Ie.:
 foo.com
 *.foo.com
 I can't find out how to do it and I'm starting to believe it's just not possible.
 We just can't set "Domain" parameter in opendkim.conf because we are sending emails with hunderds if not thousands of domains.
 rspamd is not an option because it's too heavy weight (slows down the mail delivery singificantly at this scale of emails).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I had an interview with a recruitment agency today, was a general chat with the usual personality questions, from the junior consultant girl. Followed up with some more technical networking/infra questions from the senior interviewer. 
 Long story short, the senior said she's probably got something VMWare lined up with a 3-6 month contract, and will called back tomorrow with a series of technical questions. I am a systems/network administrator with proficient L1-L2 experience, and even build servers both physical and virtual from the ground up, utilizing technologies such as Hyper-V and VMware on the occasional blue moon, or when the need arises. I have been doing this for roughly 10 years. 
 Now I understand while the market is pretty good for IT jobs at the moment, I can't seem to get over the fact, that all these high level engineering questions get thrown at you, or something that is super specific to the business. Half the time it's not even listed on the job advert and here I am thinking yep, a suitable sysadmin role only to be thrown curveball after curveball of things non related to original advert, or what's listed on my resumé.
 Does anyone else experience these sorts of things in the application process and what sort of questions should I expect tomorrow? She knows I'm not VMWare certified but still stated that an 80% success on the questions will land me the job!!! 80%!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 My environment consists of ten terminals and two file servers in different sites.
 The file server consists of drives:
 D-data
 P - fslogix profiles disks
 L - logs for storage replica
 All on OS server 2019
 ​
 During business hours I ran the test-srtopology command and then the entire network was disabled.
 I guess it happened during the ICMP traffic test or during perfomance tests.
 I honestly couldn't find and understand why it affected the entry to the terminals.
 Because I performed the replication in general on a different drive from the profiles, I ran the test and the command on drive D.
 The logic says that there is no effect on the function but the facts show that the problem started close to the time I was working on the file server with the command I explained earlier.
 And the problem was solved when it was over.
 ​
 I would appreciate your help in understanding this, what was the problem?
 And is the storage replica solution suitable for file servers with a function like mine.
 Drive D contains regular files and documents.
 ​
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, I'm a bit of a beginner so was hoping to get some pointers on how to achieve the below please. Apologies if my question appears ignorant. Any input at all would be greatly appreciated.
 I am looking for a way to streamline some aspects of my job by doing some remote commissioning of PLCs, BACnet gateways, Modbus devices etc.
 While I am completing these works at the moment, the site is typically under construction, so there is no internet access or core switch operational. I have to manually plug into network switches around the the site and configure devices that way.
 I have got my hands on a cellular 3G router and have got it configured so I can use it to remotely connect to a site PC via RDP and use that for remote commissioning.
 What I would like to achieve is being able to plug this 3G router in to any isolated network switch on site and be able to connect to and pull data from devices such as the PLCs and gateways dynamically and communicate with a remote PC rather than a local RDP.
 Ideal setup would be:
  
Remote PC at home (192.168.xxx.xxx)
 3G router plugged into switch on site (10.10.xxx.xxx)
 Applications on Remote PC at home able to communicate with IP devices plugged in to network switch on site (For example opening my PLC configuration program and plugging in the 10.10.xxx.xxx IP Address to be able to configure it remotely.
  
I have got the dynamic DNS side of things working and am aware I can set up specific connections via port forwarding, but I am looking for a more dynamic solution where someone on site can plug this router into any switch on site and I will be able to talk to any of the 10.10.xxx.xxx devices dynamically without having to set up dedicated port forwarding for each unique IP address.
 Is a solution like this feasible, or should I continue with the site laptop/3G router combo I am currently using for remote access via RDP?
 Appreciate your time and input.

 The short text on this post is that I've been exploring backup options, we're currently an Acronis house for on-prem backups, and I've lost the will to live looking at a 300% jump in costs if we want to implement backups for the ~8TB data we have in 365 through mailboxes, SharePoint and OneDrive. 
 We're a nonprofit, and our 1.5 FTE staff in IT are supported by an MSP who want to resell us Veeam. We have Synology NAS for storing VM and database backups, distributed across 4 sites. I'm told the Synology 365 solution sucks but it's basically free. I want to save £5k a year by using it anyway. I'm looking for more impartial opinions than I've been given so far.

 Main problem i am faced with currently is tidying up the current AAD estate. 
 All applications are assigned directly to users in AAD rather than through groups, the problem i currently have is; 
 I want to assign applications through groups such as (Core Apps, Engineering, QA, Customer Ops) groups based on departments/roles within the business which will help in me automating application access. 
 My main concern currently is all the applications assigned directly to existing users, I wanted to avoid doubling up giving access but I'm struggling to think of a way to put everyone into groups, giving them the access they need and not creating duplicates. 
 Of course there's the manual route which I'm happy to do but will be kicking myself if there's an easier way to do it and i find out after.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, we've got a Ruckus Virtual SmartZone Essentials box and for staff/student WIFI we use Radius to authenticate with a DC NPS server which then assigns a VLAN to route through the appropriate filter on our Sophos XGS.
 It works, but is a nasty experience, especially on Android where the user has to choose encryption type (LEAP, PEAP etc) and certificate - with Google Pixel not working at all. On desktop and Apple devices it's tidier just taking the username and password.
 I'm being sold CloudPath as a solution but I just can't wrap my head around why I need an extra product.
 I've managed to get a landing page to authenticate to AD which works OK, except for all the certificate errors for the Ruckus landing page and then for XGS.
 Anyone got an idiots guide on how to improve this or am I going to have to fork out for a proper onboarding solution?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, 
 Our Commvault 5 year deal is coming to an end.
 I'm not in that company so ling, so I inherited it with the job.
 It's going to end in about 5 months and I was considering my options.
 I've been working with veeam before, so I am familiar with it, but also considering 2 more vendors, veratis and rubrik.
 I was wondering if anyone can offer some technical tips in 2 scopes:
  
Things to check when look for a solution, like deduplication and encryption for example 
 
Comparison with the vendors I mentioned from your experience. 
 
 My current setting in comvault is with a dell scv2020 and a server connecting the storge (called media agent).
 For comvault renewal I've been notified the server won't be needed anymore but the storage is out of service.
 I can get 3rd party support for the storage, using it for a few more years and saving costs but I understand other vendors has their own appliances with internal storage and such, that will probably cost more to implement then using the storage I have now.
 I mostly backup DB, important data server and our vcenter.
 Also backing up to cloud, using metallic. 
 Any advises?

 Is there any sort of group policy or other setting we can change so our devices forcefully require the password to be entered once every 10 log ins instead of face ID?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve always loved linux and networking since I was a kid in highschool. My greatest project at that time was putting msfconsole on a jailbroken iPad mini. This project took me 2 weeks to complete (slacked off about half those days) but once finished it gave me biggest rush to see msfconsole load up, even if I did absolutely nothing with it. I knew I had to do this for a living. 
 fast forward, graduate college with a BS associates in computer programing because I hate school and couldn’t beat another 2 years. Finally get my degree at 20 and what do I do with it? Nothing. For 3 years. Since out of highschool I worked BS manual labor jobs. I always knew I wanted more, but didn’t think my degree would get me anything. Until 6 months ago. 
 Now, by pure luck, I’m a tier 1 sysadmin (skipped help desk completely) at a VoIP company, writing a script to fully automate the setup of a wireless modem in a fanless PC, to cut a two box implementation down to 1, and simplify the process for those who need to install the equipment. 
 Pinch me I’m dreaming. 
 There’s nothing like the feeling of rebooting a device, watching your logs show you over and over again a successful setup, and knowing the months it took to make this happen resulted in a (somewhat) stable configuration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know what some might say right away, imposter syndrome, etc, and there might be some of that.
 But in other real ways I’m not good enough at my job and it’s hurting me, hurting the clients, and hurting the customers.
 There’s really two problems: one is that I’m tech-savvy and have a real knack for this stuff, but past a certain level of technical difficulty and outside of a certain level of emergency I lose focus and falter in knowledge. Like, if the server is down right now, I can figure outa way to get it back up. I might not be able to articulate how, but I’ll get it running again. But ask me to troubleshoot what happened after the fact and I’ll flounder. Similarly if you give me a bunch of machines and an end result, I can get them running… but are they configured correctly, or do they just “kinda work”?
 The second is I really have a hard time working hard enough or doing the work I need to be doing. If I don’t have a person calling now, I try to go to my ticket queue, and I can sit and stare at tickets or click in and out of them multiple times without doing anything. And that’s if I don’t give in to the temptation do something else entirely. I’ve blocked Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook on work computers during the day, and it helps, but I can still find ways to not do work. I have things that sit in a queue for days or weeks because I get so anxious I avoid them until I can’t any longer.
 I’m failing the rest of my team, and I feel like shit all the time about it. And that just makes it worse.
 I think about jumping ship to another job, but I actually like the company and people I work for, and I know it would only help for six months to a year, and I’d be right back where I started.
 I don’t know, this may not be the place to talk about this, this is less a technical conversation than maybe mental health mixed with discipline, but maybe some of you have some advice to help me get back on track.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two industrial machines that communicate via broadcast and multicast traffic. 
 I'm trying to block a set of ports and multicast addresses while keeping the other broadcast and multicast features working. 
 So far the devices I have laying around will only apply the firewall on routed traffic, not touching the devices on the same network.
 Looking for a recommendation on a device. Hoping to avoid a micro PC with two network ports: our setup is portable, people tend to yank power before worrying about shutdown sequences.
 Details:
 Broadcast is used for detection then multicast for actual communication, so both machines need to be on the same LAN to play nicely.
 They also use two realtime communication protocols at the same time, one protocol is nice and efficient, and the other one tries to hog the entire link to itself. The nice protocol uses IGMPv2 and the 236.0.0.0 range, the other protocol is a blackbox but uses 239.0.0.0 and opens ports 30000 thru 30007. I think if I could drop 239.0.0.0 and the associated ports I could solve my issues.
 I'm trying to add Point 2 Point wireless for long range comms using the lightweight protocol, but the heavyweight protocol seems to saturate the wireless bridge and the lightweight protocol can't connect. Everything works OK enough with Wifi 6 links, but I'm trying for hundreds of feet in a noisy environment, with TP Link P2P or Ubiquiti P2P limited to their 100Mbps ports. Upgrading to the 5ghz P2P stuff seems like kicking the can down the road, since at 15 feet away the heavyweight protocol is laggy over 802.11ax.
 Googling around brings me to articles about "Packet Filtering Firewalls", but without naming any devices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was using explorer patcher to move my taskbar to top successfully before 22H2. But yesterday my computer got updated and the taskbar went back down. So, I tried a bunch of stuff until I managed to get it back on top and, as I found this instruction nowhere, I share here in case someone needs it.
 The difference between this solution and the regular instruction I found around the internet is that they all suggest editing values of a "MMStuckRects3" key, which was working for me before 22H2, but not anymore. The hack is to add a new REG_BINARY to the registry key below (create if does not exist):
 [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MMStuckRectsLegacy]
 The name of this new value must be the device instance path (second property when navigating to Devices Manager > Monitors > (target monitor name) > Properties > Device Instance Path). Get everything after "DISPLAY\" and replace the other "\" by "#", such as:
  
Device Instance Path: DISPLAY\PHLC056\5&3C07B47&0&UID266
 Registry key name: PHLC056#5&3c07b47&0&UID266 (letters in lower case between # and &UID)
  
Using this as the name of the value, enter the following binary value:
 30 00 00 00 fe ff ff ff 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 3e 00 00 00 28 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 60 00 00 00 01 00 00 00
 Restart explorer.exe or sign out/in and the second monitor taskbar should be at the top.
 Hope it helps!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A bit of background:
 I'm responsible for deploying Android-based devices in MDU/manufacturing/healthcare environments. Anywhere from 50 to over 1500 at a time. The process involves updating the device firmware and enrolling into an EMM/MDM of some sort. Because of the nature of the industry, a lot of the time we're forced to use guest Wi-Fi networks or a mobile hotspot to do so, which means we're limited to running 4-8 at a time, and even then, still run into issues that require a reset and re-enroll of the device.
 That said: here are the back-end requirements needed to complete these steps:
  
For the firmware updates, an HTTP/S server (apache, IIS, nginx, etc.) w/ relatively quick on-board storage (SATA SSD or PCIe NVMe).
 For Google services and EMM enrollment, a decent (unrestricted) pipe to the internet.
  
I'm thinking I can kill two birds with a single device, but I've yet to find something that supports the following:
  
Wifi 6 router supporting HTTP/S server functionality and
 Cellular WAN functionality (5G or LTE cat. 16 or better) OR
 the ability to authenticate via RADIUS to hotel landing pages that require a last name and room number, for example.
  
My initial thoughts are to go with an x86 appliance such as the FW6D from Protectli, though I wanted to get your thoughts before I made a decision. 
 Thanks in advance!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last couple jobs were at a large regional ISP. I mostly did the capacity maintenances for the edge aggregation routers to the core, via ROADM. I’d add and drop fiber links from the ring, add the configurations for the new interfaces in IOS-XR, write the MOP, sometimes order equipment and deploy it to a hub, and either ran the maintenance or scheduled it to a overnight guy to do for me. 
 I also did new turn-ups of E-BGP peers on the CRS-16, and helped manage the core route reflectors. We were first escalation for outages as well. 
 I left work for FMLA reasons and my confidence is low. Most jobs are enterprise and not sure what to expect really. It’s hard for me to remember some topics I knew inside and out. Managed primary the underlay transport but did some MPLS L2VPN, L3VPN, and VRF stuff for enterprise BGP peering.
 Anyone have any tricks or tips to quickly catch myself back up? I find re-reading material I’ve already read to be difficult. It’s like the information is in the back of my head and the moment I read it again it becomes boring.
 Also having trouble finding interviews. I used to get several lined up and competing offers. Barely even getting responses from company recruiters. Often passed up and never even spoken too.
