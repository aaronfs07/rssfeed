        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone looked into this? I did some digging but all I found were logs from https://www.gharchive.org/, these are helpful but I'll have to download all of them and then extract the usernames, and then after that clone each repository.
 ​
 Just asking if there's already an existing tool, it would be nice to have something where I can have a threshold of how many stars each repository has.
 ​
 I already did most of the work and I can continue using my method, but I'm just asking if there's something that already exists and is maintained.
 ​
 Here are the steps I took:
 I've downloaded all the logs in 2 methods
  
using the API on https://www.gharchive.org/ `wget https://data.gharchive.org/20{15..22}-01-{01..31}-{0..23}.json.gz`, it actually ended up being 800GB which is insane
 the other way is to use google cloud platform BigQuery, I downloaded a CSV of users which was almost the size of 300MB CSV file
  
now that I have these, I can then use github api to get their repositories.

 I’m looking to move away from my QNAP NAS to a DAS. The DAS will be connecting to an HP ProDesk 600 G6 Mini which is running as a Plex server / Home Assistant server, and which supports USB C 3.1 Gen 2 (or USB 3.2 Gen 2x1 as HP like to call it!). It doesn’t support Thunderbolt. The DAS won't be moving to any other computers at any time, staying connected to the server.
 I don’t want to add extra stress to the server (i3-10300T and 32gb DDR4-2667 but runs 24/7 for HA) so I’m thinking hardware RAID, and because I’ll be running at least four drives I want RAID 5 support. I can’t fit a RAID card in the ProDesk 600 G6 min…]]></summary>

 I have a external 4TB USB Disc that goes to sleep when it is not accessed for a certain time.
 ​
 It this model in 4TB: https://www.tradeinn.com/techinn/en/intenso-memory-center-3.5-usb-3.0-6tb-external-hdd-hard-drive/137796299/p
 I access this disc via ISCSI on a Debian system. I noticed that this disc becomes unavailable as ISCSI Target, once it has gone to sleep because apparently the drive name changes and it gets a new device name usually the next free letter for example instead of /dev/sdd it changes to /dev/sdf messing up my targetcli setup.
 I followed advice and instead of the device name I pointed targetcli to /dev/disk/by-id/...
 But unforutnately that did not help either. After sleeping the disc will not be accessible on ISCSI. 
 I'd prefer to have the Disc continue to go to sleep in order to save energy, but still want it to wake up and be available on iscsi. On windows, I also sometimes had issues with the disc not being detected anymore once it went to sleep. It usually helped to rescan for the USB devices to redetect the disc. Also manually reswitching the power button helped. 
 Is there any way to make sure that targetcli keeps the external hd connected, even if it goes to sleep on Linux Debian/Ubuntu?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[(Wow. The title is awesomely misleading.) I have a lot of conference videos which i need to stream to people who are interested in listening to again. Youtube is good enough but i have been recieving copyright notes for background muisc and its becoming a pita to keep checking them off. Also sometimes muting them is not an option as sometimes the speaker voice too gets muted.. Another issue im facing is rating and other issues. These videos are medical in nature so, blood and viscera are involved and i am uncomfortable putting them in public domain. Sometimes for case disscussion purposes we have to go into " nsfw" territory ( for common folk). Using plex is good and all, but i have to send my iot home id to all for login, which i dont want. Any options to that?
 We are open to buying but all are strictly low budget as it is more of an archive and reference material.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After having many issues with flash drives over the years, I have recently reverted back to using optical media for backup/ archival purposes. Specifically for Documents and Photos. Occasionally videos. 
 I've found keeping adequate backups of multi terrabyte libraries cumbersome and expensive. I keep only one copy of anything unimportant. Three copies of anything important. Then for photos, documents, software, or any content I make myself, I keep a 4th copy on optical media. Typically DVDs or Blu-Ray. Usually burned when I put photos on the computer. 
 I also use Rewritable media, to copy anything I'm working on periodically. 
 I've had a bad run with USB drives, and have given up on all of them. I use SSDs instead.

 need help with this plan. 
 The book is about 150 pages.
  
Cost of 500 a4 papers is $5
 per page cost in printer is $0.0036 [which multiplied by 0.0036 * 150 pages is = $ 0.57
 binding or spiral with holepunch will be less the $1 i guess??
  
I will be using software like bookbinder 3.0! or BookletCreator! and use back to back printing to save page and ink.
 is there a better or cheaper way to do this?
 please dont say buy the book because believe me i would but that not possible and nor can i use an ebook reader or kindle or tablet or a phone because those options are not possible for me for this particular issue. Since I have the copyright so there is no issues there.
 need to print the cheaply as possible.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently saved some data to a flash drive, a sandisk cruzer 16GB that I can't quite remember when I purchased and how much I've used. It was certainly more than 5 years ago but I have probably only used it sporadically. It had only been about one month (!) since last used and was "stored" on a desk top and when I went to access it, some of the data was corrupt. (I'd been experimenting with par2 files which I had never used before and ended up using them to restore the corrupted portion successfully, so in the end it was a nice learning experience)
 I had heard that flash drives lose charge over time but this seemed ridiculous. One month!? It wasn't the newest drive but even so, maybe just bad luck. I had another 16GB drive just lose the entire partition table in the past to the point where I needed to reformat but that was certainly longer than 1 month. That drive seemed OK after a format but for how long?
 Is there any reason to think cheap m.2 drives are better in this regard? They are similar in size and more deeply reviewed than usb flash drives. Maybe I should switch to using them for any serious usage? Of course SSDs have their components changed pretty often these days so reviews are not as reliable as they once were.
 I have some interest in this since at work we archive test data using flash drives. It seems like a bad idea but I have thought that perhaps the risk is overblown. But now that I've run some tests on it I'm starting to change my tune. Maybe I should advocate for switching to external hard disks or blu-ray/mdisks. Tape is probably impractical
 (Unrelated: I ran some tests with another flash drive with some small magnets around it and it appears the data remains solid on flash drives even when sandwiched between magnets for a day or so. So that information looks to be accurate so far. I tested with md5 hash compare in this case.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This may seem like a very odd post. So when I was a kid (around 10), I used to be messy and a hoarder (of physical things). But I would also hoard in roating cycles from OCD-Hoarding to ultra-minimalist material lifestyle.
 Never truly being able to find an appropriate balance. As with the hoarding always made me feel extremely burdened and cluttered in my mind. Then the ultra-minimalism of materials, made me have to slowly start buying consumer items that I needed (or think I needed). Never finding stable ground in either.
 Now that I have transitioned into adult hood in my 30s, the same shit is happening in the digital space. I have a NAS Synology which has been great!
 I have so much memory available in my drives. And even though my NAS occupes a small amount of cubic inches in my apartment. Having it fill up with files makes me feel cluttered in my mind/life, but then deleting the files (because I feel like it would de-clutter my life) makes me anxious because what if I need them one day? Then I ask myself, what's the point of hoardingdata? I can't seem to feel at peace over this.
 I am sorry if this isn't the right subreddit, but I want to know if anybody has ever experienced something as similar to this as me?

Traditional approaches to securing OT/ICS do not adequately address current threats. 
Operational technology/industrial control system (OT/ICS) assets that operate, control, and monitor day-to-day critical infrastructure and industrial processes continue to be an attractive target for malicious cyber actors. These cyber actors, including advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, target OT/ICS assets to achieve political gains, economic advantages, or destructive effects. Because OT/ICS systems manage physical operational processes, cyber actors’ operations could result in physical consequences, including loss of life, property damage, and disruption of National Critical Functions.
