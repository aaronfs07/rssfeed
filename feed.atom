 We've been using it with one of our clients for a few months now and we have this issue that occurs for maybe 10% of users. 
 Their setup is like this: Dell Wyse 3080 Thin Clients with AVD/WVD package installed. We have an MFA policy in place to prompt for MFA every 12 hours. This is working and users are being prompted every 12 hours but this is where things get strange.
 90% of users will then be served the desktop shortcut on the thin client and they will be able to access that with no issues, but some 10% of users don't get the RDP desktop shortcut, even with successful auth. Has anyone experienced this and have any idea what we can do to resolve?

 We can track computers to each room if staff ever move them.
 Does anyone know of another tool other than solarwinds we I can use to export a list of which MAC address is connected to which switch port? I'm looking for something a bit more efficient, and solarwinds isn't always reliable.
 I'm sat looking at a PC now which is connected to the network, but solarwinds says it isn't lol

 I've been building/repairing/troubleshooting my computers for many, many years. I've always been the "computer guy" among friends and family. I've gotten my A+ Cert (this actually expired, but I did it), and my Security + cert, currently working on my Microsoft admin cert. I can do basic programming in JAVA, C#, and Python. I've built quite a few computers over the years, I've troubleshoot a ton of issues. I did once work in a PC shop building/repairing computers when I was a teenager but now I'm much older. I'm pretty good at figuring out solutions to my problems. 
 The job is help desk however I'm kinda wondering am I really prepared? I guess you could call it imposter syndrome? The person who hired me says he's confident, but I'd like to hear about others and their first IT job experiences.
 My end goal is I think I'd really like to be a System Admin, or director of IT. I know I don't want to be anything like a software dev.

 Externally this is possible as the connection to the ADFS comes via the Application proxy (WAP) but internally its failing to connect and prompting for credentials vai Forms type prompt.
 does anyone know if it is possible to pre-authenticate the chromebooks so they can access the IDP login page without getting the Forms prompt.

 I always used to do this with a scheduled task login script - but that's proving to be unreliable these days.
 Does anyone have any ideas how I could get some local user accounts to reliably map a domain mapped drive with domain credentials.
 This is for a non-long term necessity so can script the login temporarily.

 Is this something that can be disabled for all Windows users on laptops via Active Directory/Group policy -im not yet familiar with administering Windows Servers i'm L1 User Support 
 So in our work network all work laptops, work desktops, and user's personal cellphones use Static DHCP addresses. We allow user's personal cellphones on the staff network for communications. I have however noted that some users avoid formally requesting for their personal cellphones to be connected to the staff network so they just create mobile hotspots off their Windows work laptops when they come in to work and connect their phones. Some users bring extra devices e.g home laptops, or they get visitors and just do the same to get a connection. We do have a guest network in place.
 Is this practice a security risk, something to worry about and can this be blocked

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think this is the right community for this topic, but if you think there is some other more adeqaute sub reddit, please tell me.
 I am in the process of migrating our Hpe StoreVirtual (LeftHand) VSA cluster to a new (and supported) solution.
 Our HCI infrastructure is a basic two nodes stretched cluster, in a network raid 10 configuration. These two nodes are in two different CEDs rooms, connetcted through a 10GbE fiber cable. LeftHand has proven to be a reliable solution in these 8 years we used it.
 The only (big for me) cons I have toward Hpe is the support policy: if you do not have a valid maintenance contract, no one besides hpe personnel can gain access to the OS in case of problems. I mean the OS of the StoreVirtual virtual machines that "do the magic" abstracting the local storages and make them visible to the vmware cluster as a (one or more) vmfs shared datastore(s).
 Our reseller strongly advised us to move to Hpe SimpliVity, because that's the natural step forward basing on our specific topology. SimpliVity too has the (big) limit above: once it will go EOSL you will not be able to gain access to the "ninja" console in case of troubles.
 Personally, I gave a look to Vmware vSAN solution and I proposed it as an alternative to my reseller. They discouraged me for the following reasons:
 - VMware vSAN solution is not natively fit for a two nodes stretched cluster. It born for a three nodes cluster, and in order to cover the gap with other vendors, it later adapted the solution to work with two nodes solutions as well.
 - vSAN does not have the "data locality" peculiarity. Data blocks for a given virtual machine are written across the nodes, independently from where the vm is located. SimpliVity, as opposite, has this advantage (inherited from StoreVirtual VSA after all).
 Do you agree with this analisys or the reasons cited above are weak and vSAN is in any case a better solution for my cluster topology?
 Thank you,
 Francesco

 I've started working on a telecom service provider company, and my job is the assurance process for multiple mobile services among those is the Private APN service (if you dont know what this is, its basically a custom name tag for your mobile connection so that the service provider can route you to your private network)
 ​
 Honestly I feel lost, there is not much info on the internet about the subject, and the company only started to provide this service since 2019, so there is no experts on the subject. 
 ​
 What I'm working on right now is a proactive approach for monitoring this service, and I just don't know what to look for, all of the in built alarms/systems/indicators we have are for monitoring the core network as a whole, and nothing i can find is APN based or even single customer based.
 ​
 So on the slight chance that anybody here works on the same thing as me, I would like to meet them

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone have any advice or best practices for creating resilient network file shares?
 I have 2 machines directly connected, and they each share a read-only NFS folder with each other. It's important that the mounts don't go stale and can automatically connect despite the boot order or unforeseen temporary disconnections. E.g. if computer 1 boots first, then it should connect to computer 2 NFS whenever computer 2 comes online.
 At the moment i've achieved a workarond using a '@reboot' cron script to clear stale mounts but it bothers me that i have to do this. I imagine there's a proper way for this since I imagine it must be a common problem.
 Thanks for any suggestions!

 We're relying on email forwarding from our support address to another mailbox to create tickets, it's been working fine until now, but all of a sudden the original sender information is no longer kept, and all tickets appear to be raised by our support address.
 any input is greatly appreciated

We are developing a new version of the system and i, as a DevOps am responsible for the topological design. Even though our application servers are on a somewhat private network it is IMO still not secure enough since everyone in the organization connected to the network can possibly sniff the traffic.
 We have an application server, a database server and an AMQP server. Sensitive data will flow between these servers so i need to encrypt the connection. I use a rather simple docker setup, because i don't think the application is big enough to justify k8s or other orchestrators ATM. 
 I have thought of two solutions: 
  
TLS configured directly on the AMQP (RabbitMQ) and SQL (MySQL) servers. I have heard, and seen benchmarks that shows a rather significant performance impact.
 Create a wireguard-based overlay network (netbird, tailscale or something else) to use for all traffic between services.
  
Have any of you solved similar issues, or just have some thoughts i am listening.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hiyo
 It's my turn to perform the IT orientation for a new C-level user. Other exec's have been promoted from within, so they got their IT orientation when they came on board as manager, rank-and-file staff, etc. This person is new to the organization.
 My usual orientation involves a bit of a discussion on how to get support, how we handle IT assets, where to find important data, important distribution lists and groups in outlook, where to find printers, brief conversation about IT policies (and where to find and agree to them), and so on.
 Specific LOB tools are oriented by other groups - HR does the bit about payroll tools, finance/purchasing does their bit about procurement, and so on.
 It occurred to me that this is probably more finer detail than this person needs or wants. I was thinking that I should probably keep high level - save your data "here" (OneDrive), we use Teams as a communication platform, here's how you get support...
 If you're the new executive to a company, and you've got ~30 minutes of an IT orientation, what's the most effective use of that time?

 For those of you who work in environments that have built solid QoS policies, wha model are you guys running with? My inclination is to implement an 8-queue model in my lab... however, if that is not likely to reflect the "real world", please let me know and I'll do it differently.

WE had sccm which was covered under our gold partnership but we lost gold because MS sucks. Our laptops are covered by intune anyway and it just so happened we had a catastophic failure and lost our main sccm server. We actually could restore it but we have lost of lot of the licensing for it and dont really need it anymore as we only used it for updates and laptop deployment. So it's only windows updates that is the issue now. I cant seem to recall where I setup the gpo to point to the internal ms server aka sccm. I need to undo this and for now have them all go to the internet until I get wsus setup for servers, I've tried rsop and everything and cant seem to find the right gpo to change this because rsop shows that it is the local policy where this was set. Doesnt the domain policy overwrite local. Do I need to remove ccm etc before it will work. SCCM is a weird beast to undo

 The quick story is that I've got an interview with a very nice job that's networking related, although the job description is more of a jack-of-all-trades type description, which is perfect for me. This is in a school district, so you MUST be professional. 
 I'm 20 with some 'hippie hair' (Down to my shoulders and poofy-like, very neatly kept), and my Dad's really wants me to get the position as well, but he keeps insisting I get an almost military cut, saying 'You Need To Play The Game' and to 'Grow Up'. I'm an avid Homelabber, and since my interview is over zoom, I'm hoping that will be the strong point in winning them over, I really doubt they'll pay my hair second mind, but anxiety's getting the better-half of me, so I wanna know how it would affect how if you saw a candidate with professional looks, all boxes ticking but they 'look like a stoner'.

Just wondering if anyone is aware of a trade secret to accomplishing this. The environment is a non-production testing system, but will ultimately have a proper license applied.
 A quick google produced this method: (appears to apply to versions below 7)
  
Start the SSH service on the ESXi host
 Start a SSH connection with a SSH client (e.g. PuTTY)
 Delete the current license:
 rm -r /etc/vmware/license.cfg
 Copy the new license:
 cp /etc/vmware/.#license.cfg /etc/vmware/license.cfg
 Restart the VPXA service:
 /etc/init.d/vpxa restart
  
Just wondering if anyone's actually done this before and can provide some insight.
 I need to maintain access to Vcenter and the ability to Vmotion, and power on/off vm's for possibly another 60 day eval period.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm setting up a centralised syslog server using rsyslog, and so far I've got the server set up to receive syslogs from remote hosts on 514/tcp, which sends the logs from each host to /var/log/remote_syslog/%SOURCE%/%YEAR%/%MONTH%/%DAY%/syslog.
 This isn't the worst thing, however I'd really like to be able to split out the received logs to the same log files as they are on the remote end; i.e. /var/log/messages from host1 goes to /var/log/remote_syslog/host1/2023/01/12/messages, /var/log/secure goes to /var/log/remote_syslog/host1/2023/01/12/secure, etc.
 My config for the receiving end -- the server -- looks like this:
 template( name="file_server_template" type="string" #string="/var/log/%$YEAR%/%$MONTH%/%$DAY%/%SOURCE%.log" string="/var/log/remote_syslog/%SOURCE%/%$YEAR%/%$MONTH%/%$DAY%/syslog" ) *.* action( type="omfile" dynaFile="file_server_template" dirCreateMode="0750" dirOwner="root" dirGroup="root" fileCreateMode="0640" fileOwner="root" fileGroup="root" ) 
 And the config for the client:
 *.* action( type="omfwd" target="<ip_address_of_server>" port="514" protocol="tcp" StreamDriverMode="0" action.resumeRetryCount="100" queue.type="linkedList" queue.size="10000" ) 
 The closest I've come to splitting the resultant log files on the remote end is using %PROGRAMNAME% in the template, but that doesn't preserve the structure of logging to messages, secure, etc, instead it logs each program (e.g. sudo, su, crond, rsyslogd, etc.) to its own file, which is not exactly what I'm looking for.
 I can't find any example configurations which achieve what I'm trying to do, hence I'm asking here in case anyone has figured it out. Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have all been asked the question where they ask you how much do you want to be paid when you have interviewed. I found the "best" answer for it that has worked really well for me. As soon as I am asked that question, I ask "what is budgeted for the position?" That turns the tables on them and they need to come up with an answer. A lot of the time they do not want to name a number hoping you can be gotten cheaply but this changes it into your favor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry for the lack of understanding.
 I have a router doing the neighbor discovery and route advertisements.
 PC on the wireless gets an address using SLAAC cause there's no DHCPv6 on the network, and it's within the right prefix.
 But I can't ping, can't do dns lookups or anything. I would have thought acl but it's allow all and SLAAC isn't possible without permitting traffic to the client for sure. 
 Client is windows 10 Aruba WLC and AP
 I learned that SLAAC being advertised by the router makes that router the GW and there's no way around that. But not all parameters supplied in the RAs are being adhered to like the dns server. 
 My routers and switches and the WLC can all ping one another fine using the global unicast.
 Does SLAAC require the GW be link local? It just seems maybe that is the issue but I'm not certain.
 Thanks in advance

But I need to put together a plan or "order of operations" for the order and times it'll take for each job involved in the process. I'm thinking it'll take all in all, about 4 months to do it properly.
 In your experiences doing this in the past (my first time, hence the question), how do you go about putting one of these plans together? I'm going to give myself buffer times in each job involved to so I can cover mine and the other engineers asses to. But how do you go about putting it together, do you do them on word and elaborate on each step with a time associated to it, or excel for it or something else?
 If its a bit of an odd question then apologies, but it's my first time doing something big like this and I thought it made sense to put it out there and ask

 UPDATE: After an hour working with a microsoft support we were able to retrieve the mailbox and downloaded inboxes into PST files. After importing one of them, it is not showing many of the emails. It is only showing the deleted emails, nothing in the inbox, nothing any where else. I am still searching online for answers. Possible it is corrupted?
 I still have the back up plan of loading the OST file from the user. I have a question about that though. So the email/outlook login is on a different domain profile, so the user has only logged into the new domain profile. Is that OST still safe, as long as I disconnect from the internet and then login to that user account. Also, will that OST file have ALL the emails?!?
 I would like to thank everyone for their input. I really want this nightmare to be over lol

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this is an odd one, but bare with me. So i recently attempted to migrate a clients core switches from 2 Nexus 3ks in a VPC configuration over to 2 Arista 7020sr’s in a VRRP / MLAG configuration. 
 After swinging cables, everything was working except for ONE virtual machine server (which was of course mission critical). This server lives on their one and only ESX vSphere host, on VLAN 100. Mind you, there’s about 15 other servers on this VLAN 100 network that were working just fine.
 VLAN 100 lives on the core switches, with the VIP being 10.64.100.1/23 shared between both switches, and .2 and .3 physical IPs living on switch 1 and switch 2 respectively. So .100.1 is the default gateway for all the virtual servers. 
 Their ESX host connects to the switches via a port channel that participates in MLAG, and carry’s all vlans across it. 
 Now the issue we were seeing on this single server (which was address .100.147) was that it was not installing arp entries correctly. It was unable to ping its default gateway (.100.1) and ONLY had an arp entry for .100.3, which is the physical IP for VLAN 100 on switch 2. All other servers were correctly installing the arp entry for the VIP .100.1 as expected, but this single server was the only one not properly handling ARP entries. 
 Any ideas on this one? I’m quite new to using VRRP / MLAG so i wasn’t sure of any possible limitations, or what i should be looking for in vCenter or on the VM settings. 
 Any help would be appreciated! Sorry for the “all over the place” explanation, im hella tired after the cutover attempt.

I have been working for an ISP and we mainly used BGP for everything so it's been a while since I used either of those protocols. I nailed every BGP question btw.
 They also ask me about switching, firewalls and how to tshoot high latency problems. In all of those questions I think I did great so idk. Would you hire someone who doesn't remember OSPF and EIGRP packets?

 Everyone these days acting like devops is some renaissance/new age enlightenment of automation. Guess tools like Ansible has made it easily accessible to the masses, but I never understood why old school shell scripts was any more difficult.
 Now this craze has spread to the neteng community. People who work at the largest scales absolutely need these skills to even survive and work efficiently. It's nothing really new. I just don't understand the hype....people have been doing this shit for ages.

 If I try and enable shadow copies on one it works on another it fails with a 0x80042306.
 Found some articles that point to competing backup software but none is installed and the fact one drive works and another doesn't makes me wonder about the drive.
 The drive permissions are the defaults on the one that works and on the one that doesn't the drive is set at the volume/root as SYSTEM and Administrators Full Control.
 The data folders have the required users level permissions added on them.
 Could it be that?

 For our Windows-Clients, we decided to go with Defender as we already pay for MS365 Premium License where its included and its easy to manage and configure over the defender portal. 
 For our 20+ Windows-Servers, we are not really sure in which direction we should go. We are looking to update everything to Windows-Server 2022 in the next months, is the default included Defender functionality enough? Or should we go with Defender for Business? Or is Defender at all not enough for our Servers and we need to go with one of the bloated, complicated 3rd party solutions like bitdefender, trendmicro etc. pp? 
 What do you people use at your companies? I have a lot of experience in Linux-Admin stuff but not really in the microsoft world, thats why I would be happy to get some insights from the experts here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning,
 I run IT for a small defense contractor. One the compliance controls we have to meet is some sort of authentication before users can access our network. Our users all exist in Azure AD, so my thinking was that I'd implement some sort of SSO portal users must go through when their computers join the network in order to gain full access to the internet and internal resources on the network. 
 However, all of the solutions I've seen seem to be designed to work with an on-prem AD, which I'd like to avoid deploying if I don't need it. Are there any tools you all are aware of to achieve this goal? Maybe even through SAML?
 Our networking is handled through a SonicWall TZ300 and a few HP Office Connect 1920/1950s for reference.
 Any guidance is greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a small accounting dept of about 3 people.
 They have 2 contractors who do work for them.
 We have no on prem infrastructure, everyone uses SharePoint.
 Problem: When the contractors make Excel workbooks, they link other workbooks to it. Then when they drop it in SharePoint you open an Excel doc and all the links are broken. The only way to "fix" it is to go into every new Excel workbook and manually update all of the links to point to the source files they put on SharePoint. I cant expect accounting to do this all day, I wouldnt want to either.
 This is a HUGE problem. Accounting has files fractured everywhere and the consultants with all these inter workbook links are making everything a tedious mess.
 What is an appropriate solution to this? I imagine step one is getting the consultants to actually START the workbooks in the same space that we will end up accessing them from, and also keeping the sources there for links. Assuming they will actually listen to that, is SharePoint a workable tool for it? I need something that doesnt involve VPN but also isnt too complicated to learn for the end users and consultants.

 I inherited a new environment and it's a Parent Child Domain. I need to implement RBAC which is not a big deal but there were some questions I had to anyone out there they may know the answer. The Big thing that none of the Windows SMEs or Linux SMEs here can figure out whether or not to enable the "Other Domain Supports AES encryption" in the trust between Parent and Child. Now we run mostly Win2012R2 and Above on the Servers and Domain Controllers and all the Linux Servers are at least RHEL7. We do keep RC4 Encryption enabled. We I started RBAC on the child in which the Exchange Server Resides, I enabled Kerberos and it broke the Exchange Server that resides in the Child (All services were running email was not flowing). So I am working on RBACing the Parent First before doing the child. I am wondering from both a Windows and Linux perspective and since we still need to use RC4, should we check this box or leave it unchecked for now still.

 Long time lurker - first time poster.
 I manage the IT for an 80 person consultancy company, my work laptop - a HP Probook 435 X360 has a weird trackpad issue which HP seem to be unable to resolve, and are not accepting liability for. 
 The trackpad works fine in BIOS, and from a bootable Ubuntu USB - but not in Windows 10 or 11 - no matter which version I use, or even in the Windows set up from bootable USB. The trackpad did originally work when the laptop was new (it's about 4/5 months old now.)
 I've tried uninstalling the device in device manager, running all updates, updating firmware, tried different OS's. It seems to fail on any Windows OS. 
 Any ideas before I lose my mind?
 Thanks in advance.

 Which one would be more beneficial to my career of the above. Currently I am working for a known vendor's firewall TAC. The end career goal is nice contractor role; I've seen that network engineer contractor roles are more predominant in DC than Corporate environments. 
  
MSP providing private cloud, colocation. Scope: Mostly support/change requests with some chance of minor project work. Ticket example: VPN TSH, creation, FW rule creation, generic network support tickets. Tech stack: Fortinet, Cisco SW, Forti SW, VMWare
 Some few Cisco Asa, other vendors scattered 
 NO SDN/SD-WAN/NSX hands-on.
 Automation is out of scope for role.
 
Note: Support is ONLY for private cloud related network and firewall deployed by MSP in customer's enviorement.
 
Major ISP providing private cloud, colocation. Scope: General maintenance, new customer instance ( can't recall word ) creation, project works in ongoing migrations Tech stack: Cisco ACI, Cisco shop with Nexus, Blades etc.
 
Automation is in project and they allow room for / support involvement in the automation and other projects.
 
 Your opinion is appreciated.

I'm sure we've all been there where users return laptops and they are in a disgusting state, or even equipment we have such as switches, routers, APs, servers that have been sat in a dusty store room neglected for months if not years.
 What do you use to clean your equipment and screens?
 Personally for my own home and desk set-up in the office I have a plush microfiber with screen cleaner. A small brush for my keyboard and mousepad.
 For laptops, we are lucky enough to work in a lab so we have access to a ton of Isopropyl alcohol. I use some Costco microfibers and Isopropyl to wipe down almost all laptops, keyboards, mice, servers and switches.
 But I'm interested in hearing what you all use?

 Now I'm all about some documentation, but two years? For one for one device replacements?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I've been tasked with mapping out our infrastructure across both the on-prem datacentres (which I already have tools for) and also our AWS/Azure networks. Is there anything you'd recommend that is capable of doing both or am I looking at using multiple tools and bolting the outputs together in Visio or similar?
 Note: I'm not looking for anything to perform monitoring, just collect the information and ideally be able to run on a schedule so I'm not having to manually chase changes made by other teams.

 I'm looking for one that integrates with Intune, so i can pull out our existing devices and automatically assign them to our users, and most importantly pull warranty information for me, so I don't have to look up every serial number manually. 
 ​
 I've already tried several, including SnipeIT, EzOfficeInventory and BlueTally. The closest I got was with BlueTally, except they only pull warranty information for Dell and Lenovo PC's.

 Is there anything out there that does these two things?

 I'm setting up a new solution that will help automate various processes in my company, one of the processes is the permission assignment, the permissions will be affected depending on an element that the user chooses, as is known, users do not usually remember what permissions they may be given when selecting a certain profile.
 I was looking for a solution to document all the permissions that are granted with each profile, the idea is to make it easy for the tech team to manage and for the users who need to see the information to see. 
 That the solution has integration or easy implementation within Microsoft 365 is a plus. 
 Some idea?
 Thanks a lot.

 https://imgur.com/a/51gpns5
 Looking for the exact Part Number (18ASF2G72PDZ-3G2R1) provides several results for about 78$ Examples:

 https://www.serversupply.com/MEMORY/PC4-25600/16GB/MICRON/MTA18ASF2G72PDZ-3G2R1_348565.htm
 I expected to pay a bit more for OEM parts, but almost 10x the price seems a bit too much.
 What I am missing? Is this just a robbery by Dell? Do you have any experience using non OEM memory in Dell servers?

 i wanted to check with you guys if any of you have experienced this issue on your Win 10 machines. For us it started about two weeks ago, and I cannot, for the life of me find the cause.
 Basicly what happens is that Outlook/Teams will not sign in, and the Start menu button is not responding.
 We have about 500 Win10 clients, and so far it has been about 30 machines that have come to us with this problem with random intervals. The eventlog is jam packed with errors, the same as you see in the link below. We have a fix in place that works well, and the user is up and running again, but I am struggling to find the culprit/cause of this. I worry that this will continue with more and more computers coming in to us with the same issue.
 I`ve eliminated windows update as a cause, our antivirus, and we do not have ClickShare installed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow sysadmins.
 We have a certain user in our organization, which of reasons I am not really able to discuss, is in need of a very strict computer policy, mainly in regard to web browsing.
 The user itself has asked for a surveillance solution where they know that every X second a screendump is taken and saved to a location the user itself cannot access, but that the user knows a supervisor both has access too, and frequently browse through. This will effectively prevent the user from doing wrong things on the internet as they know they will be “caught”. 
 In addition, we are thinking of installing a VNC-server so the supervisor at any time can connect and remote view the screen. This will pose as an additional “threat” to the user to not do anything they should not be doing.
 Any tips regarding a working web filter would also be appreciated. 
 Obviously, we will have a signed contract between the end user, the supervisor, and the company in regard to this deal. We will also make sure local authorities accept our solution as not to violate anyone’s basic rights. But like I said, most of these ideas originated from the user itself, and we believe the legal part of it won’t be an issue.
 Technically we are hoping to run this on a domain-joined desktop with Windows 11.
 In summary:
 1) Need a software/solution for taking a screenshot every X second and save to a folder inaccessible to the user itself. Other ideas are welcomed. 
 2) Software alternative to VNC in order to being able to remote view a computer at any time without end user interaction.
 3) Any working webfilter to block certain types of websites.
 4) Other tips on how to set up a secure and surveillance of a computer in order to make sure the end user knows they cannot perform any foul play even if they are tempted to, or technically able to do so.

So far we have two N5k with four N2k each as fabric extender in use. The two N5k are configured as vPc peers. Virtual machines and servers are connected with vpc to two different fabric extenders each, in order to create a failsafe and to be able to perform ISSU updates without interruption.
 We plan to replace the N5k with slightly "larger" Nexus 9300 and the N2K with slightly "smaller" Nexus 9300 as fabric extenders. this means to rebuilding the old design.
 I realize that the future of data center best practices is in a different. (ACI or VXLAN) However, I think the traditional design meets our needs and requirements.
 Now my question is, do you disagree with here to replace the N5k with n9k and also the N2k with n9k as fabric extender? Are there perhaps more elegant options?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, fellow sysadmins!
 I work in a large manufacturing company (cca 1300 employees and cca 500 PCs). Almost all PCs do have enabled Remote Desktop Connection, which works great. We also have WOL set up, which also works great. During COVID time the need for a work-from-home option has been introduced. So we set up remote access to PC via Remote Desktop Gateway. We also put 2FA on it. Also no problems. Last month our boss told us, that we need to set a policy on all PCs that would put them to sleep (so the company can lower the power consumption and especially the bill for it) after more extended inactivity. So now the problems start.
 Most PCs wake up when you want to connect to them via RDC (either inside a company or from home), but some just do not want to wake up and the RDC window put out an error for failed connection. But the strange part is, that if we send the WOL packet to the same PC it will boot/wake up without a problem. So BIOS and NIC are configured correctly for WOL. Are there any different settings for waking up PC from sleep when there is network activity to it? Did any of you experience similar problems?
 I'm grateful for any answers or suggestions.
 Regards

All servers are in 1G and 8 SFP+ ports are unused. Original connection was wired with Cat 5 and unmanaged switches but we are buying new POE switches (7-8 in numbers) and my question is:
 Can we buy 10G uplink access switch and connect SFP+ from access to SFP+ of core C9300??(Star configuration)
 OR 
 How to connect all acess swithces to core any suggestions??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Preface: Yeah, I know. "Don't span L2". This is one potential option for a migration from a legacy network in an industrial environment, not a traditional enterprise environment. There are options to migrate to a routed design but it would be significantly more work so I'm considering this option as well. 
 For the topology, imagine 50 routers with wifi and ethernet interfaces (bridged), connected in client mode to a backhaul wifi mesh. The same subnet should be available on ethernet behind all of them. Minimal performance requirements means it doesn't matter if they all terminate at a single hub and have to route through the hub every time to reach each other.
 My first thought was EVPN/VXLAN over IPSEC tunnels in a hub and spoke setup, however I don't think the Cisco IR1821 (which is otherwise perfect for this design) supports EVPN. I may try to find the minimum device that supports it and see if it fits the budget because its fairly standard at this point.
 Next was L2TPv3 but it appears to be point to point only, i.e., the hub could only have a L2 pseudowire terminate with one other device.
 Just bridging ethernet onto the mesh and encrypting the mesh isn't an option unfortunately.
 Are there any options I'm missing? 
 To avoid an XY problem: the only requirements are that layer 2 traverses the backhaul network, encrypted/terminated by well-known-ish-vendor devices we control (not the mesh itself). Bonus points if the terminating devices include the wifi radio because it removes a point of failure.

 say there is a small office configured with 4 switches same model and all in the MDF, your firewall has 4 LAN ports. would you just run a trunk to each switch or is it more common to run to a single switch and chain them all together. I do not see saturating the 1gb connection at the site but I would imagine running a cable to each switch would be more redundant. I don't want to over complicate this property and spanning tree should do its thing if someone connects the switches together somehow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We run 100G internally at our data centres, currently using DAC cables to connect the servers to the switches, however we are seeing very high failure rates on the DACs. We've replaced at least 5 in the past 3 months. Considering we only have about 30 in total, this seems high. Every server has redundant connections (2xDAC in LACP) so it doesn't impact production, but it's wasting a lot of time having to RMA the failed cables with Juniper, and coach Remote Hands through replacing them physically.
 The equipment has been in place for about 4 years, and the equipment is never touched except to replace failures.
 Could we be doing something wrong with the DACs? Should we consider replacing them with AOCs instead?
 Each DC is a single rack, so distance is not a concern. Cost is also of minimal concern.

Why is this the case when there is still the other fiber in the pair plugged into the switch? 
 Might sound dumb, but I’m really trying to understand the ‘exchange’ that happens in order for the link lights to turn on. Because it looks like there is some negotiation that happens to determine what a valid Ethernet link is. Thanks in advance!

 ​
 it is my understanding, and I have been told that if you have a domain controller, it has to do DNS and possibly DHCP. 
 Is this correct? 
 I find that the problem with this is that if the server goes down, it obviously takes Internet along with it, so it is a double whammy outage for the business. 
 What are best practices? To have DNS and DHCP both on the domain controller, or to configure it on the firewall and have backup / fail-over / secondary DNS, DHCP configured on the domain control?
 What do you guys do and prefer?
 My clients are generally 10-100 employee businesses, have a couple between 100-300.
 I don't want to over-complicate things, but I also want to maximize reliability & redundancy, within reason.

 I'm a junior sysadmin based in the USA. I'm sure you guys have seen the news regarding the weather on the west coast. 
 Today we had a power outage and as of this post we are still without power. We are currently powering the crucial servers which host the domain controller vm's etc via a gasoline generator with 240v extension cords lol. 
 Needless to say the power outage sparked a big conversation, at work, about the cost of maintaining on prem AD environment. For instance we had to call an electrician to fix an issue with our generator, how often do we need to be testing out the equipment in the case of another power outage, etc.
 We have a hybrid AD env but the most crucial files are hosted on prem. I floated the idea of moving certain files shares to azure so people can work (process invoices) in the event of another outage, among other things.
 As I started looking into replacing AD with Azure AD I came across the this article (mentioned in the title of this post).
 To the more senior sysadmins out there what are your thoughts the article and more importantly it's general sentiment; e.g. Azure AD is not a replacement for on prem AD but rather an enhancement?

 The issue stems from the original scope expanding and OKTA professional services being engaged to do the architecture. This effectively resulted in additional orgs being created that weren't necessary and we had users cross federating between them which created duplication or triplication of users and jacked our consumption up. At no point were we informes we should account for consumption or take additional user life cycling measures.
 As a result we've got 4 months to fix it or piss them into the wind and go to another offering. We came from Azure MFA and SSO, has anyone ever gone back? Has anyone else had any bad experiences with OKTA that left a bad taste?

 I had a bend press out on the production floor give us the old ‘no hard disk found’. Took the computer out of the machine completely dismantled it to get to the hard drive (it’s basically an all-in-one attached to the machine with a swiveling arm and the back of the case is a inch thick aluminum plate which is the heat sink for the pc). Put a new IDE SSD in it, restored the ghost image, and put it back together. 
 ‘no hard disk found’
 Grrr. Started to suspect that something more than just the drive was crapped out. 
 Got the forces in motion to request lead time and cost for a new (!) computer, which would still have hardware capable of - and running - Win XP (the servos in the machine require specific software which only runs on XP)
 6-8 weeks. $60k
 ‘Wut’
 Took the computer back off and pulled it apart again. Retraced my steps to see if I missed something. I didn’t. 
 Put it back together. 
 Back in the machine, I booted the computer again. 
 ‘Invalid partition table’. 
 Interesting… it sees a hard drive. 
 Took it back apart. 
 Hard drive back into the ancient laptop we keep around just for this kind of stuff. 
 Had to get creative.
 I suspected the MBR to be missing/corrupt. The replacement SSD had smaller capacity than the original spinner. I had to tell our ghosting software to resize the partition, which I think messed it up. 
 So I wiped the drive, looked and found a XP Professional dvd, and installed a fresh copy. Once done, I booted the ancient laptop back to the ghosting software, and wiped the partition I just created with Win XP install. 
 I then ghosted our backup image back. 
 30 mins later, I had the computer back in the machine and it was time to go for a test run. 
 Booted right up, they’re happily running production as we speak.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for a gateway / IDS / IPS solution that offers reporting a bit like Meraki's for wLAN, which provides per user activity logging based on url's visited, providing an overview of "productive time" and "recreation time" that can then be shown daily / weekly / monthly. I realise this is somewhat intrusive, but I'm tring to convince management not to install employee tracking software on all user machines, so is a kind of a lesser evil.
 This is for deployment into GCP/AWS for a remote working environment where all machines are to be auto-joined to a VPN at boot, likely using tailscale, but this has not been finalized yet.. i.e. we could consider an all in one solution, if one exists.
 Any recommendations would be appreciated!

 Is it possible to move into this kind of role and jump from 110 -> 160-180 ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We appear to be running into an existing design constraint with an IPSec implementation with Azure VPN gateway. Essentially, we have a VPN gateway in it's own vNET, peered with this, is a hub vNET which peers with many other vNETs in a hub/spoke topology. The VPN gateway vNET and other vNETs are spoke connections connected to the hub.
 ​
 We need the ability to have inbound connections from our other spoke vNETs to be NATTed to addresses on the VPN Gateway's vNET. 
 For example:
 User VDI vNET: 10.10.10.0/24
 ​
 VPN Gateway vNET: 10.100.0.0/24
 VPN Gateway Route: 10.100.10.0/24
 ​
 As traffic is being sent through the VPN Gateway to 10.100.10.0/24, All inbound addresses from 10.10.10.0/24 need to be mapped to an address in 10.100.0.0/24
 Conversely, Inbound connections from 10.100.10.0/24 to 10.100.0.0/24 need to be able to return to 10.10.10.0/24
 ​
 After spending a good amount of time reading documentation and creating a test environment to validate this, I've not been successful. Unless i'm reading something incorrectly, it appears that only the VPN Gateway vNET itself can be NATTed to a new address. 
 ​
 Is there a design constraint here with VPN Gateway or this there another design constraint that needs to be considered?
 ​
 Thanks!

And they are always tied to SIB 0 plane 0. All the devices with link errors tied to SIB 0 also all have Major Processing Errors on the PFEs. I'm tired of dealing with JTAC because they request the same solution to RMA which does not fix anything(SIB0 has been replaced). Could this be a software issue, and technical issue causing the Processing errors on the PFE that are creating the FPC link errors ? Please share...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I am a Network Engineer for a Municipal ISP. I finally got around to requesting IPv6 space from ARIN and have been assigned a /32 prefix. I've been doing quite a bit of research regarding design and deployment best practices, but I have a few questions that I'd like your thoughts about.
 Thus far my Ipv6 addressing plan is to assigned /64 to all service provider infrastructure, such as customer facing interfaces and VLANs, /56 for PD, and /127 for p2p segments.
  
In accordance with RFC 6177, I'll plan on assigning /56 prefixes to customer end sites using DHCPv6-PD. When a customer site receives a PD, how does my PE router know what interface to route the assigned PD prefix towards the customer? I'm not sure if this is vendor specific, but let's assume I'm using Windows Server for DHCPv6 server and my PE is a Cisco Catalyst 9500.
 
When a customer wants public Ipv4 space from us we usually just allocate a /29 and statically route that prefix to the customers IP on the p2p segment. Is this methodology considered best practice for Ipv6 also? 
 
 Thanks in advance!

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month's updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft's Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft's updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work.
 Test, test, and test!

 Just want to get a pulse on what marketing/buzzwords are going around.
 Kinda makes me roll my eyes when I hear these buzz words cause I feel like nothing as really changed from a fundamental implementation perspective.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a rant but also a question.
 I work for a small size company in America. My boss is American and has been quite harsh on me lately.
 A few years ago, he decided to outsource some of the company operations to the Middle East. That didn't work too well but still kept some guys there.
 Part of my job is to provide these guys in the ME with training and advice, which I do in almost a daily basis. What is happening is that they don't seem to comprehend any training I give them. I have been giving them countless of trainings and spent a lot of hours that ended in nothing. 
 They get the idea but when it comes to real work, they cannot connect the dots. I'm not an English native speaker so I'm not quite sure how to word this without sounding too harsh.
 I recognize I'm not the best instructor and possibly being English not my first language has something to do with it but still, I'm puzzled. Not sure what to do. Is it cultural? Maybe they are not thinking logically? I don't know.
 Example: I teach them how to solve an issue (e.g restoring a backup). They say "Ok, understood". When the same situation presents again, but varies slightly, they screw it up and cannot solve it thus making my boss really angry AT ME. 
 If something changes, even slightly, they get mega confused and cannot solve it.
 Have this ever happened to you? If yes: How did you explain it? 
 This is probably more a linguistic question than a sysadmin one but still I wanted to try here. 
 I'm so tired of being reprimanded for other's people mistakes.
 Thanks for reading 😥

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy y'all,
 So I work at an ISP as an edge tech/engineer or whatever you want to call it. Anyhoo, I mainly work on PON systems and the corresponding CPE that we deploy at sites. What I am struggling at the moment with that I am trying to solve is that we currently have the Calix Cloud services to onboard and monitor the Calix Routers we deploy along with some Nokia Beacons from a prior agreement that I am trying to pass down a DHCP statement to onboard them into the TR-069 server without the Calix routers having to phone home first to get their TR-069 address because that takes forever and the Nokias want to phone home to their native address that is burned into the firmware which is what I want to avoid. I've already created my class statement in the DHCP server config matching the OUI of all the models we deployed but when it comes to the subnet pool statement, I either have the option of only allowing members of the class to get a DHCP lease from the pool or I can issue a "allow unkown-clients" statement which pushed the option 43 statement to all devices in that pool. Without creating a separate pool for all other devices that aren't Calix or Nokia, what is the right convention for like an "if not a member of class" then assign a regular DHCP lease without the option statement?
 shared-network LAB {
  subnet 12.3.456.789 netmask 255.255.255.128 { 
  pool{ 
  allow members of "CalixONTOpt60"; 
  vendor-option-space CALIXGC; 
  option CALIXGC.acs-url "http://gcs.calix.com"; 
  option CALIXGC.username "insertusernamehere"; 
  option CALIXGC.password "insertpasswordhere"; 
  option routers 12.3.456.789; 
  range 12.3.456.789 12.3.456.789; 
  default-lease-time 1200; 
  } 
  } 
 }

 Recently just joined a company and IT management who arn't technical have been sold DNA by the cisco sales monkeys. It is now a critical project (lol)
 It's only going to be used for deployment off 1500 switches and some assurance monitoring. SDA will never ever be used.
 My question is. It appears we're only receiving two appliances. Going off the cisco documentation I can only see reference to having 3 appliances in a cluster or a single stand alone instance. Are you able to have 2 nodes within a customer or does it need to be 3?

For the most part everyone has just maintained their old emails, but the question got brought up of the industry standard. I tried phrasing this question a ton of different ways to google yet I didn't get back anything nothing useful. Do we create them a new email account? Do we archive all their old emails and wipe their current account so it's clean for their new role? Do we just continue as we are and let them keep everything? Some of our employees have access to confidential information that they won't need after they leave their role for another. This got brought up because we are currently going through a massive network/system restructure and standardization process.

 My company has a listing for a blue collar field job right now. The wage is 35% higher than what I make and only requires an Associate's Degree. I have a BSIT to clarify that last sentence.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello ! 
 In my infrastructure, I have some ESX dispatched on two sites. 
 My problem of the month is to run GPUs in my ESX, for sharing on several VMs. 
 DC1: 2x HP DL380 G9 Bi-xeon / 382 GB RAM / Quadro M2000 
 Both are in a vSphere cluster, so I can manage them that way, or from the esxi 6.7u3 interface on each of them. 
 These GPUs are compatible with these machines from HP, and are well recognized under vSphere. 
 I would therefore like to be able to allocate for example 50% of the perfs and 1 GB of GPU vRAM on each of my 4 VMs (WS2019 RDS servers). 
 How can I proceed? I go around in circles, and Nvdia wants to sell me its A16 at the price of a car to make it "compatible". 
 Thank you in advance and good day !

A large majority of docks we have been getting seem to have an issue at one point or another, whether it be right out of the box or a few weeks/months down the line. No amount of updating firmware or drivers seems to help. We finally gave in and started looking at alternatives.
 Behold! The Dell WD22TB4 docking station, MFG PART # DELL-WD22TB4
 Oddly enough, we have had zero issues running these with our Lenovo laptops. One monitor, two monitors, three monitors? It doesn't care. We've deployed a few dozen of these and so far no complaints. Your mileage may differ, but figured I'd share my experience so far.

 We have a process where a vendor will be sending us content that needs to be dealt with by our end users. The content is delivered via SFTP to a Windows Server 2022 box in our Azure environment. I have the ability to move the files around our network to various locations and I even have the ability to move the files into an Azure Blob storage bucket but I don't really see a great way to get these files into my end users' hands to deal with them. Ideally the destination is something they are familiar with, like a SharePoint document library. 
 I did find some PoSh mechanisms to move the files into SharePoint but as I got down the rabbit hole, it seemed overly complex for what I needed so I was wondering if there was some mechanism I am overlooking before I full send and start working on PoSh.

 weirdest thing: I got two Draytek Vigor2820 routers. 
 I can't find them on the network, even if i connect directly to them via a network cable I cannot get onto the portal page. 
 ACT, USB and CSM Leds are solid, sometimes the remaining LEDs come on (all at once, apart from DSL). 
 I tired multiple times to use the Factory Reset hole but it does not do anything. No reset, no flashing ACT light. 
 Exact same thing with the second 2820 router that I found in the office as a backup. 
 Anyone experienced this before or has any other idea? I ordered a new DrayTek which will arrive tomorrow to test. 
 Thanks

A simple gui to sync (ignoring deletes with some versioning) maybe could be enough.

 I have my own desktop pc and leptop from my work. I have 2 monitors also.
 Normally i run my desktop, after that start RDP connection to leptop and start working. So i can use same keyboard + mouse + 2 monitors for both system.
 But i need to connect smartcard reader to leptop (host) for development. RDP doesn't allow to use host smartcard reader, i guess it disables winscard.dll when remote session started.
 There is another way, connecting reader to desktop (client), and share smartcard readers over RDP. But it doesn't meet my needs. I use vmware and, reader should detected from there also, but readers doesn't even seen in device manager, so i can't pass them to vmware.
 I don't want to connect 2 monitors to leptop and use different keyboard mouse set. What can i do about this issue ? Reader issue has made me very sad, i was so happy for my current system.
 I tried some VNC apps, but they only control current leptops screens. Doesn't share client's both monitors.
 I don't know is there any way to do it, but i hope for it..

 We have been working on a network monitoring project for a client, we are using nProbe to collect NetFlow/sFlow from different devices (ASA for example), flows are then exported downstream to an ELK stack where we visualize traffic and generate alerts in case of problems.
 As a late request from the client, we have been asked to monitor BGP backward transitions as well, I know we can set up specific SNMP traps to monitor BGP events effectively but what about NetFlow data, do you think it's possible to monitor BGP events (esp backward transitions) using NetFlow data ? if so what metrics should I be looking for? 
 Hope my question is clear, happy to provide more information if needed.

We created the template with the required x509 extensions in our internal CA and successfully created all the necessary user certs. The one thing I noticed though is that the SKI is identical on all of the generated certs. Shouldn't this be a unique value on each cert? Each cert was created using a unique CSR and submitted through the CAs web portal if that matters. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello community,
 I have some servers in my office I would like to connect to through a "VPN"; 
 I can either:
 - install an OpenVPN, and a dyndns server to connect to a bastion
 - use services like Tailscale or Cloudflare Tunnel. 
 Is it more secure to go through Tailscale or Cloudflare ?
 They would be bottlenecks right ?
 The advantage is that they provide integration with an identity provider.

 Computer Configuration\Policies\Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Windows Update\Configure Automatic updates I've set to option 4, "Install during automatic maintenance True", "Every Day". 
 I've then applied this to the OU for DR servers. If I run gpresult on a target server then I can see the GPO has been applied BUT the "Install during automatic maintenance" is set to "False". Everything else is set as per the GPO EXCEPT this value. 
 The end results is that these servers (windows 2022) do not install updates automatically. 
 Any suggestions what I can try?

 regsvr32 schmmgmt.dll 
 Yup, still the same on Server 2022. But why? It's not difficult or anything, but I just don't understand why Microsoft chose to do it like this. Why is it hidden? Because you can royally screw up your AD? Well, ADSI Edit would like a word with you. And why make it visible like this? I can't think of any other sysadmin task where manually registering a DLL is the normal way to do things.
 I'd like to know the reason behind this, if anyone knows or has a good hypothesis. 
  
PS. I'm aware I can just do
 Move-ADDirectoryServerOperationMasterRole -OperationMasterRole SchemaMaster 
 for moving the role, but not to make the snap-in visible.

But I think I might have been wrong about that as I remember having this usb extension/converter connected to usb c port on my pc and I was using that with my astro a50’s. Today I decided I needed to charge my xbox headset, so used the usb c extender and connected it to a usb of a micro usb and plugged it into my steel series, within 10minutes of pc running it got a blue screen. When restarted my astro headset wasn’t being detected, I had to re-plug it to fix it. Is it possible the usb c converter/extender caused the blue screen?

 We're in the process of upgrading our backup room. We are decommissioning two ancient P2000 G3's and replacing them with two MSA 2052's. We're running Veeam as backup so copying the backup files is relatively straight forward.
 My only issue is the amount of stuff to copy- it's well over 40TB of data across two of the old SANs. That's about 110h+ of copy time over the 1Gbps iSCSI link available to me at the moment. The links are still in use for backups and communication so maxing out the link would be a best case scenario.
 I know the old and new units have got a SAS port but can that be used for copying data or is just for disk expansions? If there is no other way then I'll just have to schedule a few days of downtime.
 tl;dr- Need to copy 40TB from P2000 G3 to MSA 2052 fast. 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For months I have had an issue where all my e-mails sent to other Microsoft tenants gets either quarantined or junk mail sorted as phishing. Internally or to other e-mail services there is no issue. I have tried every reasonable recourse such as remaking signatures, changing my e-mail address and so on.
 Recently my dad who works in a different position in my company also started having the same issue. And a while back my brother who works at a different company had also reported similar issues.
 So today I created a test tenant with Microsoft to troubleshoot. I just did out of the box developer config with standard e-mail filtering for the receiving address - which is what any company on O365 is likely to be running.
 What I found was that as long as my display name includes my last name (a 4-letter word with one regional character) Microsoft categorically flags the e-mail as junk. This is regardless if the e-mail comes from my company's domain or from my private domain. As long as the display name includes my last name, it is considered junk by Microsoft. My first name doesn't have any impact.
 If I change the name by replacing or adding a letter, it is no problem, so it is specifically this name that is always flagged as junk.
 So apparently people who have my last name are by default not allowed to send e-mails to companies that use O365 for e-mail. This should affect a few hundred people at least. I already have a support case open and am planning to talk to my contact at Microsoft, but neither of those options have been very useful in the past. Is there more I can do to restore my family's honor with Microsoft?
 And also, who tf uses display name to filter spam? That seem insane.
 I have had users in my company report similar issues in the past but it passed after they changed signatures and such, but for me and my father it seemed like our last name in the display name was the only thing that impacted spam filtering.

 First interview went great, nailed it I think. They called me back for a follow up today to meet with the CIO. Also went really well.
 In the course of the discussion I asked about their health coverage. I have a wife and son and we all have medical needs in some capacity. I was given a copy of their benefits handbook for new hires and was told to expect a call within the next day or so.
 Once I was home and settled I took a look at the health coverage and HOLY CRAP!
 Even their lowest tier plan was more than double what I am currently paying through my counties insurance and they are both Florida Blue.
 I thought that it had to be the total before the employer contribution so I reached out to the recruiter and he passed the question along to the companies HR.
 They confirmed that those numbers are the employee share. Their initial offer was 13k more than what I'm making now but would actually be a 7k pay CUT after selecting the plan that provided the coverage we need.
 I countered and told them I would need 5k more than the top advertised range for it not be a total wash. 30 minutes later I got a call saying they could go up to the max, but not above it and I had to politely decline their offer.
 I was honestly shocked at how expensive their coverage was and how little it covered. Maybe it's because I've been in the public sector for the last decade but there is no way I can see paying $1700/mo to cover myself, wife and son just so that mental health visits are included.
 I was also baffled that their mid tier (still 1300/mo) was the same plan number I am currently enrolled in BCBS 5302 but my coverage (PPO) has FULL coverage for counseling and mental health office visits, no co-pay or anything.
 Oh well...

 Currently when they try to replicate their VPN issues in-house, because everything goes through the firewall it fails at 10% and does not connect. The solution to this is to have someone pull out their phone and set up a wireless hotspot and connect to that, and then log into the VPN for testing. Often times someone won't have a data plan that supports hotspots, or or signal is weak, so it's kind of a pain to test VPN in-house, but knowing their VPN is going to work when going off site is also critical.
 So my big bright idea was to plug in a dumb little Netgear router I had from home into our equipment at…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just recently received my forms for my merit increase this year. I'm not going to get into how much of a joke the amount is, how with inflation I'm technically taking a pay-cut for the 3rd year in a row. No, that's been said before. I want to call out this blurb:
 "To protect your private information, details of your compensation should not be shared with other employees..."
 It goes on to say that you should contact HR if you have any questions/concerns/etc... about your pay. I have read several articles and forums that suggest we should in fact be talking more openly about our salaries. That would encourage fairness and quality. That would allow job seekers to know what the starting pay is along with how much others in that same position make after a few years of tenure. However, in the real world knowing that Slacker McCoy over there doing 10% of the work gets paid the same as me, and Flipper Jones in the other building makes more than me, would really build some resentment and in turn a hostile work environment. I can see it from both of those points of view.
 Unions are pretty open about their salaries and public (government) jobs are typically a line item on a budget someplace and public information, so you can find that too. Is it because companies need to stay competitive so they keep compensation a tightly guarded secret?
 ​
 EDIT: Good convo so far but leaning heavily on the legality of the request. That wasn't really what I was getting at. I rather like my job and the organization I work for. We have posted pay ranges and grades so I know roughly what most people are making, if I cared to look it up. I was just wondering what the general thought was behind the secrecy amongst peers.

 I'm using MSCHAPv2, and I've been steering people toward using the Push Notification option as their default as that and phone calls appear the be the only two supported methods when using CHAP.
 It's been working great, however I've had users get confused and forget to check their phones to hit approve. The AnyConnect client doesn't give any feedback about needing them to accept the push notification.
 Has anyone done anything to work around this? Is there any customization that can be done in AnyConnect to show them that they need to accept the request?
 I see that the PAP option has more options, but 1. isn't PAP considered insecure? 2. I am using class 25 to send back a tunnel group after they login, and from what I'm reading in other threads, PAP may break that functionality with Windows NPS.
 I did see this about PAP in a Cisco doc, but I'm still a bit uneasy about using PAP:
  
By default, the ASA uses the unencrypted Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) authentication type. This does not mean that the ASA sends the password in plain text when it sends the RADIUS REQUEST packet. Rather, the plaintext password is encrypted with the RADIUS shared secret.

Also, are there any other segmentation technologies or methodologies people like or are gaining popularity?
 I've spent a lot of time looking into these options. Including talking to various vendors. but I wanted an outside perspective.

 I wonder if any one knows any solution for me to split one ethernet cable in to two but also send PoE for both devices. Originally there is one camera but need to add another device that will need network and PoE as well. So 2 pairs for one and two for other device. I know that wouldn't be a problem if there is no PoE as normally it's just two pairs for data is used. Any device/adaptor/converter to send the power over the same four data wires? Tnx.

 My on-site IT team sometimes struggles with company ownership that we're not always constantly available to assist with very basic end-user support like sharing the screen on MS Teams, setting their phone to DND, etc.. We're of course just busy with various modernization efforts OR assisting other users. We make reference materials available but they're not always utilized. My defense is usually that basic things like this are a waste of IT resources and end-users in today's age should be expected to handle these things in today's increasingly technological world if they want to work in an office setting.
 My personal gripes aside, I was just wondering what you guys would consider to be baseline minimum of IT skills for white-collar office professionals in current-year?
 I would probably name things like:
  
Login/logout, basic authentication, your 'Windows' password versus your email password being separate distinct credentials,
 Email usage basics, out-of-office/vacation responders, etc.,
 Phone usage basics, softphone, voicemail greeting and OOO replies, etc.,
 Basic familiarity, navigation, and effective use of features for popular conferencing platforms, MS Teams, Google Meet, Zoom Meetings, etc.,
 How to change Display Settings such that you can extend/duplicate/adjust your monitor real estate,
  
...just to name a few. What do you guys think? Is my position on this topic valid? If so, what things would you guys add?

Since we have a couple of buildings (100/300 meters away from where cores are), I thought GPON could be an option to distribute network to the entire place, instead of only connecting buildings. This also could help with my concern about EMI in some areas.
 I don't have that many endpoints (around 200 total), but price end up being interesting, because of transceivers/switches/licenses that would need to be replaced with a CAT6 project too.
 ​
 So, anyone uses GPON?
 As someone that never worked with, I would appreciate your thoughts on this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been tasked with configuring Cisco switches so that some code (a TCP server) running on a Windows PC can communicate with some clients, while having link and hardware redundancy.
 Unfortunately I am not a network engineer and so have had trouble setting up the switches in the best way possible.
 The current topology looks like this, basically everything is connected to everything, the idea being that server A (or B) can talk to all clients even if one of the switches goes down, with all the links being doubled as well.
 A relatively default configuration of the switches works, however whenever one of the links goes down, or anything requiring a topology update, the reconfiguration will easily take 2min, which seems way too long to me for such a "simple" network.
 Are there ways to configure the switches and ports so that a switchover would essentially be instant (a few seconds) in case of a failure? I looked up LACP but it's not clear to me if that could even be applied in this case were the redundant paths are not on the same switch.
 I feel like there should be some straight-forward configuring I should be able to do before I start tweaking hello times and whatnot... especially since the network is fixed and will essentially be locked in a black-box with everything having fixed IPs with no risk of having random devices connected by accident.

 I would Like to reach PC-B from PC-A with RDP. I have a static NAT rule in the asa 192.168.50.6->192.168.1.6. So I can reach 1.6 via 50.6 outside. If I put a laptop on the outside it works fine, i can reach PC-A via the tunnel too. I opened up the firewall completely and I do not even see hitcount on the acces lists when I would like to RDP from PC-A to PC-B.
 The tunnel is up and working. Important that the two ends of the tunnel are 2 routers not the firewall. I cannot put the router behind the firewall because it is a GSM router.
 Is it even possible to reach PC-B from PC-A? Since I have to "leave" the tunnel on the other side. If yes please give me a few tips becuase I am out of ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I will upgrade an HA pair Firepower 5516-X with FTD module that is in active/passive state. 
 When reading the documentations on how to upgrade a Firepower that are in HA, it makes me wonder about the HA function in Firepower. And to mention, I come from the Fortiworld...
 Documentation: Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Configuration Guide for Firepower Device Manager, Version 6.3 - System Management [Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense] - Cisco 
 Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Configuration Guide for Firepower Device Manager, Version 6.3 - High Availability (Failover) [Cisco Secure Firewall Threat Defense] - Cisco 
 In the first link, it says:
  
If you are upgrading the units in a high availability group, upgrade the standby device, switch modes to swap the active/standby units, then install the upgrade on the new standby device. 
  
If I understand it correctly, does it say that before upgrading, I need first to switch the active unit to the secondary and make the secondary unit active. From the secondary active unit, I upgrade the secondary active unit itself. And when secondary active unit is upgraded, I'll switch to the primary firewall and make it active and upgrade the primary active unit. 
 Have I interpreted it correctly? From the Fortigate world, you just login to the firewall and upgrade it from the active unit; it will first upgrade the secondary and after that it will upgrade the primary, all by itself. In the firepower, it seems that I manually need to do the upgrade on both firewalls. 
 ​
 I'll appreciate your insight on this one.

 To not load the paper correctly can make jams more likely, and can cause the paper to curl excessively. This is mainly due to the manufacturing process.
 Hopefully I'm not alone in this. I wonder how many jams could have been avoided.
 Edit: It's extremely amusing to me that their are a handful of people that seem to deny that this is even a thing. Here's a regular ream of printer paper that specifies "print side". Apparently this paper is used specifically for forms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two separate environments. In both cases, the operating system and domain levels are the same. Win 2016.
 Env1 created ten years ago. Persistent errors. Env2 created three years ago. Clean! No errors that I can find.
 Env1 I'm getting persistent errors. If I look back at historical logs, we have had this problem since October 2022 at least (prior to the Nov patch problems).
 In Env1 if I look at the logs in Microsoft-Windows-GroupPolicy/Operational I don't see any problems at all. No errors in processing for users logging on. In addition, if I execute "gpupdate" in the cmd line, it succeeds without problems.
 However if I look at the System log, I see the recurring events every two hours.
 Event ID 40970 The security system has detected a downgrade attempt when contacting the 3-part SPN LDAP/host1.domain@domain with error code 'The attempted logon is invalid. This is either due to a bad username or authentication information (0xc000006d). Authentication was denied.'
 Event ID 40970 The security system has detected a downgrade attempt when contacting the 3-part SPN LDAP/host2.domain@domain with error code 'The attempted logon is invalid. This is either due to a bad username or authentication information (0xc000006d). Authentication was denied.'
 Event ID 1030 The processing of group policy failed....
 After rebooting a server, the problem goes away. But randomly, it will begin on a domain server and then persist indefinitely until rebooted. Then on another day, another server is affected the same way. It could be any server that becomes affected. It seems to occur at any random time. No other problems seem to present in the environment. 
 The goal though is to remove these errors and to fix whatever issue exists in the domain.
 I'm wondering what the connection is between event ID 40970 and 1030 and where to look for clues here. Does anyone have any ideas?

Any ideas or help would be great! TIA!

 I previously worked for an MSP that had a client that had RDS access, their RDS and GW servers where separate. If you tried to access to server IP address to the RDS GW it would act if those there wasn't a website there but users were able to connect through RDS using 2FA. The 2FA part I can easily do on my own its just the security lock down of the GW so it doesn't broadcast IIS I am trying to figure out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Got a strange one here. 
 I have a distribution group that was created on premise and synced to O365 with AD Sync. It has been working fine for years. We had some staff terminations that affect this group and as part of our offboarding we removed the user accounts from all their groups.
 However, 365 still shows them in the group. I have checked repeatedly that there is no trace of either user in the AD object, and I see no errors in the AD Sync logs, but 365 still has them present. I can't remove them in 365 because it's an AD-mastered object. 
 Short of deleting the group completely and starting a fresh one (which we will eventually do anyway in our normal DG -> MS Teams upgrade process), any ideas? 
 One note - this domain used to have on premise exchange, but the removal was extremely thorough and no trace of the old org exists. I have no on-prem Exchange management tools available to troubleshoot, the Ex2019 installer fails to install the tools because it can't find the org. So I'm not sure this is even solvable.

 Management now want all staff to be able to see these files/folders in a read only manner, but they don't want them added to the Team under any circumstances. So essentially I need to give all staff access to the SharePoint backend without adding them to the group, as this will add them to the MS Team. Got to love it, right?
 My first thought was some kind of Flow to just replicate the files from location X into location Y which all staff can access. However just in case I'm missing something I figured I'd ask here.

 As far as I can see from other forums, then the issue could be many things.. One of them from the iPhone, but as written, the meetings has been created from the laptop?
 We use Office 365 and the problem has been here since November month where I received the first ticket about the problem.
 Does anyone have any idea what to do?

 In my organisation we constantly have projects ongoing which are managed by dedicated PMs but I've found that there's only a handful of sys admins the PMs want because of our experience, work ethic and skill. 
 As such the same people are always booked on huge, complex projects. 
 I myself am on 3 large projects all with similar deadlines and I'm fully booked until end of April now, so I can't take a single day off. Some days the PMs expect me to work Out of hours to do their project as there isn't enough time in hours as il end up as double booked.
 Not forgetting that I have my usual sys admin responsibilities to deal with (tickets, licence management, knowledge management)
 How and what can I say to my manager, the pms and head of serivce to basically ease up on my work load. (I can't expect them to reassign some projects because no-one will touch my poweshell scripts and will take me a week++ to get someone up to speed) 
 I had two weeks off over Xmas and it was glorious but my first 4 days back have been the longest month ever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our main infrastructure uses Aruba CX 6x00 serie switch and we manage everything with SSH and CLI. We really love them and have no issue so far.
 I have to setup a few temporary remote branches, but I don't have the budget for aruba switches.
 The remote branches would each be about MAX 10 workstations with a 10GB single mode fiber uplink, so a single 16 port switch should be enough.
 Can you recommend a low cost solution (<500$) for a 16 port switch with 10GB uplink that would be manageable with CLI(SSH) (we only need layer 2 for VLAN and MSTP). No power redundancy is required. And most importantly, that would have no issue with the Aruba uplink? I know it should be industry standard, but I've been bitten a lot of times by low cost solutions in the past, and I prefer not to lose time.
 I found the D-Link DGS-1510 line, but I have no idea what it is worth management wide, as I never touched anything else than main vendors (Cisco, Juniper, Arista and HPE/Aruba).
 The aruba uplink is a 6300 (JL658A). I don't have the SFP modules yet. Fiber is single mode OS2.

 Currently I want to expand my market worth and just knowledge in different areas. At work my permissions are restricted somewhat, we are an international company and even though my department operates without the complete oversight of our mother branch, permissions are restricted which is normal.
 I am looking at getting the dev program licence for 365 so I can actually evaluate the entirety of it and get the full picture. I am an admin in the majority of areas but can’t go running around Willy nilly and start playing with global settings. 
 Currently I am looking at getting docker, vmware (the backend stuff I don’t understand) and maybe centOS so I can learn Linux a bit more and of course my own 365 tenant.
 Do you peeps have any suggestions on sought after platforms and what free resources they have? Or an insight on “what’s the next big thing”? 
 Any and all suggestions are appreciated!
 P.S my work does fund training but that is already being used in more network related areas.

 Lets say one of the customers is running a forward proxy on their host for outgoing traffic. And because of this proxy requests from my app to the SAAS i host are not able to get through.
 ​
 Can the NO_PROXY variable be used to circumvent this like `NO_PROXY=https://saas.com\` 
 If yes then once NO_PROXY is set which software is it used by? 
 is my app that is making the requests supposed to read this env var and set something special in the request so that it goes through without the forward proxy
 ​
 or is it supposed to be read by forward proxy so that it acts like a sort of allow list in the forward proxy and lets the request from my app pass through to the internet?

 The meraki switches cannot act as a dhcp so my solution was to setup a windows server vm which would act as the dhcp server for all sites they would connect to this vm with site to site vpn’s.
 Then I would setup L3 routing and interfaces on the switch and relay the request to the VM. Is this possible or am I way off the mark any help or pointers is greatly appreciated.

 Google Store TOS says 10 devices of a model per account before you get banned, Android's EMM directory of resellers have shot us down for low volume (they wanted an initial order in the thousands, which we don't need). At this point I'm even willing to forego EMM + zero-touch enrollment, simply because we need devices.
 Trying to target popular current models - so along the lines of Pixel 7 or S22.
 tl;dr Any ideas where to procure a "large" (compared to consumers) but "small" (compared to large enterprise) numbers of unlocked, SIM-less/no service Android phones?

 ​
 I work for a small MSP and one of the roles i have is to do an inventory of customers equipment. As it is now, i have an excel sheet that i go to the customer's site, and go through each computer, 1 by 1, noting down the system specs and info (like serial # and IP address) on each computer, then i move on to network devices like printers, switches, routers, APs, etc.
 Is there any easy way this can be done? 
 Most cases this is only done with NEW customers, so we dont have full access to their network yet, and are just assessing the network, so we wouldn't have installed any RMM agents or anything YET. Only after the audit is completed, and we propose a contact with them, and they accept, do we go forward with RMM tools.
 ​
 What im looking for is a tool i can use before the later stages of us installing, example, ninjarmm agents on the computers.
 ​
 In short, is there any software (preferably free, but will consider paid as well, depending on the price), that i can arrive on someone's network, plug into their network (or connect wireless), and scan taht subnet, and get all the system info for all devices? (Even if i have to enter like a domain admin credential to allow it to authroize the scan on domain computers).

Deny any inbound ICMP traffic to the office enterprise network by default for security and allow only from trusted monitoring sources as needed. 
 Allow all inbound ICMP for ease of monitoring (say circuit uptime) or troubleshooting convenience assuming the chances of an ICMP DoS attack on the office public IPs is potentially negligible.

 Might be a stupid question but here goes....
 Were currently experiencing network performance issues, the internet speed is very slow on client devices that are hardwired into the network. All client devices are apparently negotiating at a 1Gbps connection but the network cabling in the walls does not look like it's CAT 5E or higher, possible CAT 5 10 / 100 Mbps. All patch cables are CAT 5E and above.
 If the client devices connect to the network switch like the example below, will the computer negotiate at 1Gbps speed or will it say 100Mbps? 
 Client Device > Cat 5E patch cable plugs into wall jack > CAT ? > goes to patch panel ? CAT 5E patch cables to the network switch.
 Thanks.

If you need a short run, lets say maybe 0.5 - 1 foot I know what you can get DAC cables of that length, but what about using SFP/SFP+ connectors with fiber cables into a LC/LC fiber keystone? 
 TLDR; From a practicality and performance standpoint, would there realistically be any issues with using SFP/+ modules and LC fiber cables to connect switching appliances for short runs instead of DAC? (excuse my ignorance with anything here lol new to fiber networking and trying to go 10Gig!)

I'm most likely to end up doing mostly backend stuff (which honestly isn't my ideal choice).
 It's not that I don't like devops work (least what I've seen so far) it's just part of me I guess will always be a programmer in nature (I just can't see it in the backend work we do). 
 Has anyone been in a similar position before? I'm honestly at this point leaning I guess towards the devops work just as a bit of future proofing I guess, but in my brain its a bit of a mess of what I should really pick/would be happy doing.

 Hi Everyone
 I have been tasking with upgrading all devices at a client from 2013 Office Pro Plus to 2019 Pro Plus I have to do this for approximately 80 Computers. 
 I want to avoid downloading the installer on every device so I have specified a source for the installer. 
  
I have a folder on a shared network drive that has the xml/setup/setup files: Folder/XML File. "Office" is where the installer files are 
 I have a batch file that has the install command setup.exe /configure Configuration.xml
  
When I remote into a test device, and run this batch file, I get an issue where office "Fails to Download" 
 Searched up and down all over the web and I cant find anything specific to ODT
 https://imgur.com/a/as8nkFz
 If I remove my source path and let it download the installer runs fine,
 Does anyone know what might be causing this? Id rather not have the deployment download the files 80+ times on every device as this will hammer the network too much
 Thanks

I am not sure what to do. I worry a lot about switching positions or careers but feel quiet rudderless at the moment. The hours seems to be getting endless and no time where I feel like things are “complete”.
 Maybe this will be deleted idk, just looking for some help. Maybe it’s my company (small org)

 For example I am company A that goes to company B for IT services, company B outsource to C and D and so on. Quality drop because it workers are treated like crap, low pay no benefits etc. And companies also suffer because they get bad services. 
 Here's another example comp A outsource to Company B. Company be sends Billy to be there full time and look after then. Billy get paid $20 hour and company B bill company A $100 for Billy... Billy is not happy. Company B suffer too. Why doesnt bring all IT back in house and treat them like humans.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Started doing IT work last year, and I inherited the last person's backpack. Great to have it but it is enormous on me; he was a big guy. I have narrow shoulders and am short, to boot, so it hangs too low and is pretty uncomfortable walking around wearing it when it is full of 15" laptop, chargers, cables, misc parts and batteries, etc. I saw this thread on different sub, and the Everiki Atlas looks great except some Amazon comments say it is large for a small person to wear comfortably. Looking at other posts on this sub, I do love Swiss Gear but yeah, too big. Comfort matters more as I age.
 Any small people who have recommendations? Some brands make "women specific" packs for narrow shoulders and smaller frames, but these are mostly hiking type backpacks. I like the multi-section approach of a tech specific pack like the Atlas, and since I also want to use it as an under-the-seat backpack for personal travel, I appreciate the extra features of easy access top pocket, sleeve, etc. I may just buy a 11-15" Atlas and try it, but thought I'd check here first. Thanks.

 I always been curious if I downgrade the license for one user from Exchange P2 to P1 (Or E3 to Business Standard ) while user is already having 70GB of emails in his storage. 
 I think after downgrading to P1 he will have 50GB of his emails still exist but what about the other 20GB he has before? where would it go? especially If I returned back his Exchange P2 license again would the emails appear like nothing happen? 
 Did Microsoft talk about it in any documentation? thanks

 just curious whats best practices for OSPF networks (single area). Let‘s say having a large network with many subnets in the range 10.0.0.0/8. The vlan interfaces are on different routers across the network. Would you rather configure the whole 10.0.0.0/8 on every OSPF routers, or just configure every interfaces subnet under area 0.

 ​
 to make things clearer 
 we are creating a new network 
 segment dedicated to backup systems.
 that network needs to be accesible from a small
 number of computers. 
 ​
 our initial idea was to filter it via 
 fw but then again the new network
 might still be visible to others.
 ​
 is is possible to create some sort of 
 an access list per vlan?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I've just realised something that is a bit annoying. When I create a symbolic link to a network share, then navigate to that symbolic link and open any subfolder on that share, the context menu "New" option only shows the "Folder" option with the UAC logo. See this picture.
 These are the steps to recreate the issue:
 1. Create a symbolic link on a command prompt: mklink /d d:\LocalFolder\ \\NAS\NAS_Folder 2. Navigate to d:\LocalFolder 3. Open any subfolder inside that symbolic link. 4. Right click/New. You will see only the "Folder" option with the UAC shield. 
 It's worth noting that if I directly access the \\NAS\NAS_Folder and open any subfolder, the New menu shows all available options and the UAC shield is gone.
 What's going on and how could I prevent that behaviour? Disabling UAC from registry only gets rid of the shield but the context menu still shows just the Folder option.
 PS: I've tried this also on a recently installed Windows VM. Same thing happens.
 ​

 So basically a tool that could pick out interesting pieces of information that a human may not spot (or even think to look for). Or even produce stats that someone spends hours each month producing. Anything that may have added value to your business. Thanks

 I had a quick question today - Has anyone created a form which users can fill (First name, last name, employee ID and email) which then goes to the sysadmin email distribution list for approval. The next step is a tad more complex - If approved, it would then make a local AD account automatically.
 I was looking for a solution using Power Automate, but that seems to be mostly aimed for Azure environments and I think needs a PS script to perform the LDAP related changes. I've also been investigating a locally hosted PHP/HTML/CSS/JS instance which could do this, but it's not my strongest skill.
 I did see a paid product called Adaxes (I believe) which can do this, but ideally would like a free solution.
 Just looking for a solution to ease the flow of new staff members at my site this year.
 Any suggestions are welcome!
 Thanks!

 If I'm on a fresh install of ubuntu on GCP, are there any tips or tricks for setting it up? I know this seems like a very very vague question but I've just been really struggling and getting stuck at different points during each attempt. 
 (worst case scenario we could hire someone to set it up, as our college IT doesn't want to get involved in our pet projects, but the goal is low cost)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a container that I want to expose to the public internet which acts as a proxy to a private subnet hosting a bunch of applications. The exposed container is an authentication proxy that validates auth headers before forwarding upstream to the private subnet.
 Is the idea to put the auth proxy container on the host network since host can communicate to all bridge networks? From here, I would put NGINX & all software on a user-defined bridge network to isolate from the public internet but accessible via the auth container on the host network?
 Curious if I'm missing anything with respect to security and isolation.
 Example:
  
Auth Proxy: Network mode is host running on port 80 and 443 for plain HTTP and TLS
 
NGINX: Runs in user defined bridge network, let's say 172.16.0.0/16
 
App 1: Runs in same subnet defined above with static IP 172.16.0.5
 
App 2: Runs in same subnet defined above with static IP 172.16.0.6
 
 I don't want the public internet to be able to talk to NGINX or App 1 or App 2, but force communication to proxy through auth container bound to host. 
 As an additional question, is it true the host can always talk to a container on a user-defined bridge network? Is it possible to ensure only App1 & App2 can only be communicate to via NGINX and not the host? I assume something like the following would suffice?
 iptables -A INPUT -i docker0 -j DROP

To test this I have been running ping plotter on a machine directly hooked up to my WAN switch. When the packet loss happens the route in the Carrier network changes to 1 or more different routes until it returns back to the route that I have had previously. So far the longest packet loss that this has caused lasted 3 seconds. This has been observed multiple time in an hour during business hours.I have to wait until Monday to hear back from my assigned engineer.
 For those working at carriers is my observation correct, or is there something that I could be missing?

 I was wondering if anybody had any useful tools to visualise / document network address space usage.
 We use a /16 network address which is subnetted by environment then subnetted again, and again….
 This address space usage is currently documented in a table and although accurate, it isn’t the most “accessible” documentation.
 I was wondering if anybody had any tools / tips for improving the format of this documentation to show more clearly the “hierarchical” structure of the network, the size of the subnets and the unused address space we have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone. I have a question about point to point vs multipoint networks (hub and spoke).
 I work in a school district which is very high density. Multiple sites connected over a Metro E connection. Would a hub and spoke or a point to point be better for this application. I would think a hub and spoke would be best due to limiting the broadcast seen by other switches. To give you an idea of my network, on a daily basis I sit at roughly 14,000 devices. I think a hub and spoke is the way to go due to limiting traffic on the incoming interfaces to what is destined to that router. The switches all share the same native vlan 300 (no IPs exist). Each individual site and the shared core have a unique vlan (vlan 30x) with their own /30 between the two. 
 Even though they all share the same metro e, am I correct in saying a hub and spoke separated by vlans (30x) would be better then all of the sites sharing the same vlan (300)? The sites really dont have a reason to communicate between each other. Traffic mostly goes between the site and the core, then out to the internet. 
 Thank you for your help.

The engineers currently work on a hybrid rota meaning they are on site 3 out of 5 days a week, and work from home the remaining 2. The team is currently made up of the following resources:
 4 x Permanent 2 x Contractors
 The plan is to keep the 2 contractors until I can hire permanent staff to replace their roles and transfer any knowledge. 
 Interested in hearing how others approach managing their teams from a rota basis. For example, should contractors be expected to be on-site 5-days a week unlike perm staff who are on-site 3? How about swapping days

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have no idea how IIS works, so please forgive any obvious lack of some fundamental understanding with this question. After so many years of system admin experience, I honestly feel kinda silly typing all this out:
 So, I have a webserver at my office where multiple sites are hosted. So there are several domains all pointed to, for example 192.168.1.50. How is the traffic differentiated between domain1.com and domain2.com when IIS receives the traffic?
 If I am setting up a second webserver or troubleshooting dns issues, etc, I am aware that I can edit the hosts file locally to force a computer to resolve a particular domain to a different IP. So, for instance, if I am migrating one webserver to another, I can do preliminary testing by updating the local host file on a test PC. I guess my question is, is it possible to pull specific web pages via IP somehow, and not edit the hosts file?
 More specifically, if I simply browse to 192.168.1.50 I just get an IIS page. What would the syntax of the url be if I am able to pull a specific site by IP? I feel like there is some building block here that I'm missing that keeps me from really understanding what's going on here.
 If my wall of text isn't clear, heres an example scenario:
 Web Server 1 - 192.168.1.50
 DNS a record domain1.com 192.168.1.50
 DNS a record domain2.com 192.168.1.50
 I set up Webserver 2 and perform a migration.
 Webserver 2 192.168.1.51
 no DNS records, but IIS is serving out a copy of domain1.com and domain2.com
 So, I can set the local host file on a network attached PC to point domain1.com & domain2.com to 192.168.1.51 and perform some testing.
 Is it possible to pull domain1.com and domain2.com by IP on 192.168.1.51 without editing the local hosts file? If I simply browse to 192.168.1.51 at this point, I would just receive a welcome to IIS page or whatever.

I think certifications are great when trying to learn new technologies especially when you may not have real world experience but want to broaden your knowledge. However, I believe real world experience goes a lot further with future employers than just have a cert alone. So I am curious, if you hold a cert in a given area and have years of real world experience in that area, do you try to keep your certs active or focus on learning new things and moving on to other certs? I am a network engineer with 7 years in the field. I currently hold my CCNP but it expires in Aug. I am contemplating renewing my cert mainly due to how time consuming it is, when I could be working on broadening my knowledge base with say a cloud cert or some other technology. Any thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey r/sysadmin,
 we finally got approved budget for testing for our fairly new department and would really like to create a test environment so we don't have test things in production and pray to god.
 At the end of the month there are going to be 8 members that need to have a place to test thing out before we do any changes to production/show new solutions to our clients. This is going to be totally separate tenant.
 We need to be able to replicate real world scenarios ranging from O365 (apps, sec), Exchange, hybrid AD / AAD, Power Apps to Intune, Windows devices, Security, Compliance etc. so we are ready to offer the solutions with them.
 I've got couple of ways in mind on how to do this but I would like to know how did you guys approach this; 
 - Did you just copy/paste tenant settings from the production environment?
 - Do I just purchase 8 E5 licences or its mostly E3s and couple of E5s for edge cases?
 - Or do we just purchase licences for the generated test users that we are testing things on and admin accounts stays unlicences / have plain O365 E1 for email?
 - How many test users you have in directory?
 - Is everyone global admin or you select few global admins and rest have their own individual permissions?
 - For computers do you use VMs or just couple of old laptops?
 Any tips are appreciated. Would really like to make this right for our team. Thank you.

According to an image from Wikipedia, the RJ45 connectors have an extra tab or keyed space. Based on this information, I am guessing that my laptop uses an 8P8C connector for ethernet connectivity because I don't see a keyed or tab space in the port. However, I could be mistaken about this. Can anyone confirm which type of connector my laptop uses for ethernet connectivity? Additionally, I am wondering where these two types of connectors are typically used.

 We are getting a DNS issue that we have never faced before.
 We host a domain with our own nameservers. Our domain has this zone (zone.example.com) in which we created a CNAME record (www.zone.example.com) and pointed it to a CloudFront website (a123455789.cloudfront.com).
 This website only works in some world regions because for some reason the nameservers of zone.example.com in those regions changed to the AWS CloudFront website NSs. As such the clients can no longer resolve the address.
 Every CNAME we create point to that CloudFront website gets this behaviour. I am very new to DNS but our partners are also unable to explain it...
 What am I missing? Really confused here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had a site that has been a problem child for me since I've started working my current position. I noticed a decent chunk of packet loss, but it's in the middle of a canyon and the only connection we are able to get at the moment is LTE.
 In the past I had written this off as a bad connection due to LTE and haven't looked into it a ton, but after monitoring the LTE modem I didn't see a ton of packet loss to it. I figured no problem, they get a ton of power outages, and don't have a generator.
 Their router is likely fried. Since it's the middle of the winter I held off on driving to the site until I had a free day to tackle it. I replaced the router and tested and everything seemed fine, but after a few days I started seeing heavy packet loss again.
 Looking at the logs I'm seeing that it's giving ESP errors and all of my phase 2 tunnels are constantly going up and down. I've verified that all algorithms match up perfectly along with DH and autokey time. The VPN profile is a carbon copy of all of my other sites but this is the only one that has any issue.
 My setup from the branch to the data center is Fortigate (Station FW) -> Cradle point Modem (LTE) -> Palo Alto (Data center FW). My ping times vary between 100-500ms and I'm wondering if anyone else has experienced something similar whether doing passthrough with a cradlepoint or with high latency causing the tunnel to constantly crash. Or if there are any pointers on what else I can try.

 I often participate in online discussions related to computer networking and datacenters. And of course there I like to share my own experiences about those topics there. However/ a bit of background information, about me, I live and work in the balkans. Some naysayers would say central europe, but 'ex-Yugoslavia' might be a better term. However for practicality I will call it 'the balkans' as for the purposes of this post I don't want to be confused with Germany or Switzerland.
 Let's get back on topic. I like to talk online about my experiences in computer networking and datacenters online. However, all my experiences have been on the Balkan. When I hear the word datacenter, my first thought are the three local public datacenters I often visit and the local state run IX.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I help out periodically with some former contacts and I had one approach me to help find a VPN solution that they can roll out to take that load off their firewall. Currently all SSL mobile clients authenticate against the internal user database of their firewall, which also deals with the user certificates. Their rate of growth has made this a bit of a pain to manage needless to say and almost impossible to monitor and audit.
 They are going to replace the firewall (already have the new one) and found they can't simply migrate the users, so we are on the hunt to find something more manageable and fluid. If they have to reconfigure each client, may as well move forward rather than sideways. Authentication against on prem AD is a must, 2FA is a bonus. 
 Cisco? Palo Alto? Fortigate? Full disclosure- I have been out of this game for a few years now (after 20 years in the trenches) and I haven't really followed too closely. Looking for ideas and places to start digging. It seems most want/ require you to change your firewalls out for theirs. This isn't really an option nor is it desired. To be honest being able to host something on a VM would be the best option, but even a dedicated appliance is way better than what they have currently.
 ​
 About 50-60 mobile clients, mostly RDP connections- that's really about it.

 I know some DisplayLink docks support hot desking. Does anyone have experience with that?
 Any other options?

 To some degree, I wonder if this is a lose-lose battle since users have different needs (resolution, scaling, etc.) and then on top of that if you can provision display configurations how does it know which monitor is which?

 We work closely with an MSP who manages our Windows updates/patching through the RMM they provide. Reboots are forced on Thursday evenings for updates to install.
 The problem:
 Today (1/6), several users reported their computers unable to boot. All of these users were on our 2019 HP Mini Desktops and Windows 10- model is HP EliteDesk 800G4M. The HP SureStart logo appears briefly (2 seconds or so) before the machine power cycles itself.

 We were hit on the at the end of December. We don’t have an IT department any more (we are a satellite office albeit a large one), so I’ve become Mr. IT for the time being. (I’m not a novice by any means and it’s not that far from my real job, but I’m certainly not the IT guy or Sys Admin!)
 Parent office dealing with the “proper stuff” (legal, dealing with the “hackers” etc) but I’m trying to restore order to the place, bring functionality back. 
 Obviously now is the time I’ve realised no one has ever thought about verifying our backups before….. they are a mess! All systems having to be rebuilt from scratch (not a bad thing really…….), but at least some of the important data we needed still exists.
 There’s not really a point to this point apart from a general “what a week” and “screw ransomware groups” (although I have a slight respect for them - It’s very impressive the damage they can do, it’s slightly fascinating!)

I looked at dumb TVs, and the Sceptres had a lot of bad reviews. So I am hoping to find a consumer TV that will default to the HDMI input, so the users don't have to deal with the smart features.
 Edit: This TV will be in a conference room, and only used for showing presentations during meetings. That is why I want the input to stay on HDMI at all times. It won't connect to a network at any point. The perfect solution for this is a dumb TV, but since those are either junk or too expensive I can't use one.

A week does not goes by with out us having to reset our cable modem or/and deal with a couple minutes outages, sometimes even hours. We are subscribed to the 600/35 plan. I have always wanted more upload speeds so we started looking for a fiber connection.
 After contacting 3 ISP I narrow it down to two companies. One is offering 1gbps symmetrical from one of their nearby PON for $489 no SLA, this connection is not dedicated, but the sales person claims that the PON is not currently being used by any other company and this has been the case for years, he even claimed (and I actually believed this) this should remain the case since the types of businesses in my street are not the type to required these speeds or reliability. The second company is able to provide a dedicated fiber line to their datacenter, after weeks of negotiation I was able to get them to come down to $730 a month for 1gbps with a 99.999% SLA. Both connections requires a 48 months agreement. Honestly we dont need this level of connection but we could really use the upload speeds to run our own cloud storage solution (nextcloud, plex, databackup services) and couple other things. in reality a 100x100mbps connection is sufficient but the price at that point wouldn't be substantially lower since they need to recover their construction cost.
 My question is, under these circumstances would you pay $241 more to have the dedicated connection with a SLA and guaranteed speeds, latency and data packet loss? or should I just save the money and go with the cheaper solution. Thanks for your opinions.

 Configured a new ASA 1010 and shipped it to a branch across the country to replace a dead 5505. Of course with the 1010's, Cisco must assume all of their customers manage a single, local branch, because they don't let you use crypto commands until you register with the Smart portal to unlock strong encryption (you know, that thing that was preloaded on all the 5500 series firewalls since the PIX's went EOL???). So that means I have to wait until the site connects it to the WAN cable to get internet before I can register it and unlock VPN commands, which the business won't run without. Even worse is when it needs to go to a country in another timezone. On the 5506's I used to be able to just preconfigure the VPN, ship it and tell the on site guy to move the cables over when he starts his day in his timezone and all will work. No no. Now Cisco wants me to wake up at 2am (8am for the site the ASA is getting installed at) so I can register with them, and THEN...only then will they let me register and be granted permission to unlock crypto commands. Scum.
 Today this scenario happened for me, but the Smart Portal is spitting traceback errors at me, and as a result, I can't view my inventory or create new license tokens, which means I can't register the 1010 to be able to put the VPN's up, and had to roll everything back. 
 Come on Cisco. Your ASA customers are NOT Fisher Price engineers managing one location, and nobody that buys an ASA is doing so for their home. Yet you insist on making things easier for residential and mom/pop shop operations and harder for enterprise/commercial grade large multi-location international companies with every new generation of hardware.

 I have noticed that going to Apple.com that the page loads up just fine. I can go to any of the pages except for one. When I go to the store tab or click on buy it shows as "The page you're looking for can't be found." for some reason. It is still apples website and not a 404. I can click on other parts of the page and it will take me to where ever. But only the shop page does not work. I have flushed DNS on client and DNS server, history, cookies etc. Maybe there is something else that I am missing? I used different browsers. This is not just a single computer specific problem either. It does not matter what device I am on.
 Currently studying for my CCNA. This would be a great problem to learn from.

 Does anyone know what the behavior will be if the manual accounts are removed? Will they re-sync based on the AzureAD connector?
 I've gone back through IAM and created groups/roles so some accounts (assuming they re-sync from AzureAD groups) will have permission changes, like going from Owner > Editor. Just not sure if other resources that these users may have created will get caught in the process.
 Looking for the best way to clean this up, since usernames are the same on both sides.
 Production workloads were stood up in GCP before I was even aware of it and not terribly familiar with Google's behavior so just being careful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, 
 I'm having an issue I've never encountered, and I'd like to get some insight as I've scoured the internet for days. It takes some work to explain. 
 For context, I took over at my location about nine months ago. We recently had a scheduled power outage at our location. Our primary devices were on generators to prevent them from shutting down. Other devices around the location did get powered off. 
 Our core switch is a Ruckus ICX7650-48F. After power was restored, I cannot ssh into any Cisco switch directly connected to the core. Any HP/Aruba device directly connected works with SSH and ping. The same is true for any cisco device downstream from an HP/Aruba. 
 Although this is happening, everything around the site is running fine from an operational standpoint. We have wireless and all ethernet working. 
 We have a Cisco 3650 directly below the core in the rack that I've been troubleshooting. When I checked spanning-tree on it, I noticed a VLAN ID mismatch with two different VLANs. Our management VLAN and the Trunk VLAN. Nothing has changed in the configuration, and I've double checked that there isn't a mismatch like it says. I get this error with all Cisco switches. 
 I've done quite a bit of troubleshooting and need more ideas. If you need more information, I will make sure to send that to you by PM. 
 Thank you!!
 TLDR: Scheduled power outage, and the management VLAN doesn't work on Cisco devices.

 I DON'T understand why but, Why is it that when someone asks for help in the IT world on reddit, SO many people seem to just comment with anything BUT the actual help needed. If you cant help maybe just move on to something else?
 It may be a different weird type of nerdy 'cockyness' but god, why can't people just be courteous?
 Why waste your and my time just to be useless and put others down?
 Anyways, For those of you who are on the opposite end of the spectrum, Thank you :)

 We are demoing a Palo Alto firewall and I'm interested in getting visibility into our intra-network routing to the firewall, and putting up some blocks in place. For instance, only our Faculty/Staff users need access to the printers and projectors VLAN, but guest wifi users don't.
 Is that the right move? And if I do that, what is the process of moving the VLANs up to the firewall? I've been reading over this thread on the Cisco forums and it sounds like our path, but If I delete the VLANs off of the core, VTP will wipe out the VLANs on the access level switches

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm currently setting up a VXLAN connection between 2 sites. The sites are connected using redundant 10Gbps infrastructure, there are some routers (2 or 3, depending on the connection) in between. Unfortunately I cannot change these connections and the MTU I get at each end is 1500 .
 I've setup a linux machine on each side, created a VXLAN connection in between, connected an additional network adapter to the network of the site and bridged the vxlan interface.
 FRR distributes the needed information using BGP evpn.
 I can ping from left to right without problems, iperf testing using UDP gets me to a little over 1Gbps (less than expected, but OK for now). However, iperf testing using TCP gets me 10Mbps at max.
 Is this purely the path MTU that is messing with the TCP connections?
 Is there a way to get TCP faster in this scenario or should we just ditch it and look for other options?

 So yeah, Digital Signage xd everyone fav topic 
 The requirement. 
 40+ Sites, one TV each per site
 Central control over the system
 Limited Control for local site admins 
 Useable by non-tech people/ Stable units.
 POE + WiFi
 Patchable/Upgradable units from the admin Panel 
 I just finished a POC of Airtame, units appear to be ChromeCasts, but they don't appear stable for us.
 Their cloud dashboard is clean, but the results when running the playlist weren't great.
 Powerpoints looped when in a playlist, for example.

 We upgraded 1 of 3 domain controllers from 2008R2 >2012r2 > 2019 about 2 weeks ago. 
 A week later we started having people experience RDP issues that were strange. When connecting by hostname people were sporadically getting invalid credentials. Changing it to IP resolves the issues.
 ​
 Luckily this is only affecting select remote users and of course IT while attempting to connect to servers.
 ​
 Replication seems to be working as intended... any advice is appreciated! Thank you

 We are in the process of relocating to a new office building, which will include a network setup build from the ground up. We currently have around 200 employees and are expecting to grow within 2 years to around 500-600 employees. 
 We currently use Ubiquiti for our AP's, switches and firewall. I have read online that Ubiquiti is fine for home and small office environments, but not so much for anything beyond that. This is also something that was confirmed by our IT partner that will be installing the network equipment in our new office. They suggest using Extreme AP's in conjuction with Aruba switches and firewall.
 I was wondering what everybody's take on this is ? Is it indeed a good idea to switch to Aruba/Extreme, or should we stay with Ubiquiti?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been chasing down an issue for several months now that first presented itself as the Start Menu not working then Office activation/sign in issues. I've gone far enough to know that it appears to be related to moderns apps being prevented from running. For example, I go into event viewer under Applications and Services / Microsoft / Windows / AppLocker / Packaged app-Deployment I see a ton of errors relating to AAD Broker Plugin, Windows Search, Start Menu experience host. We don't have any applocker rules and it's only affecting random machines. I can't explain the cause but does anyone know the fix? We have about 15,000 machines+ and our service desk gets probably 5-6 calls a day on it. Re-imaging the machine has been our only fix to this point. If I try running powershell scripts to re-register these apps I get an error saying it was blocked by policy. Also to note we are using WSUS/SCCM and block the private store as we use store for business. I have enabled a registry key to allow for automatic downloads of store apps.

 It seems there are a lot of approaches (Azure Migrate service, Azure Disaster Recovery, etc).
 But none of them is explained clearly in the Azure docs.
 So, I can make an AMI from that AWS EC2 instance and store it in AWS S3.
 And then I can copy that AMI file to Azure Storage.
 But what do I do after that? 
 My goal is to duplicate that VM on Azure, I'll still keep the one on AWS. And there is no data getting updated in real -time.
 So, there is no concern regarding downtime or replication or anything like that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're an MSP. One of our clients has 11 main sites, with a few satellites at a few of the main sites. Most of the main sites have WatchGuard Fireboxes. We were tasked with whitelisting two fairly large CIDR blocks (a /20 and a /23.) It's easy to do in WatchGuards, in "Blocked Site Exceptions," where you can choose an IPv4 network. But, one main site has a cheap Linksys or Netgear. (I can't remember the brand. But, I'm pretty sure it's one of the two.) 
 That site is pushing back on cost and wants to know what the cheapest firewall is that can whitelist CIDR blocks of IPs. I don't think stuff off the shelf at retail shops can do it. Any ideas? Since we're a MSP, we've switched to the new leasing monthly choice for firewalls. (I don't like the new model, personally. But, I'm a team player.). It doesn't even have to be real cheap, but rather a pay once and you own it. But, they do want the cheapest that can do this.
 This is for a PCI scan to occur from a 3rd party PCI compliance scanning company.
 Also, is whitelisting essentially making an allow any statement for ports 1-65535?

 Just wanted to ask a more career-based question for you all. Work for a company that supports about 450 users, some with assets but mostly just M365 accounts. I have 7 Months of professional experience so far in IT. I am tech savvy and in my personal life built computers and always had a basic understanding of how electronics work. Though I am very inexperienced and a noob I still, however, am responsible for 3 networks and their safeguarding and troubleshooting.
 I am the most senior IT person in the company because I am the only IT person in the company except for the new hire who is more hardware focused. I know I have a long way to go experience wise but I am working toward a master's in computer security management followed by Sec+ and Net+. The title at the moment is basically help desk but with the responsibility of a systems administrator, network engineer, and Azure cloud engineer.
 CEO asked me to start thinking about what my next title should be but I don't even know what I want to do in this field. I love IT, love making something work after multiple failed attempts, and the rush of self-accomplishment when the problem is solved. I like working in Azure and Intune, have not tried my hand at coding or scrips because I am not confident in my ability to not blow everything up in the process.
 What I am asking for is just some insight on what a solid next step title would be from helpdesk. I eventually want to become a CISO in the next 8-10 years but just unsure of how to get there. Unsure of what path to take because I want to do what is best for me and also have mouths to feed at home.
 ​
 Thanks

 I asked my manager for a payrise and they wasn't able to get it.
 its coming around to the yearly review in march for payrises in the traditional sense but thats still months away.
 I personally feel deflated and have lost all motivation to go above and beyond when my colleagues doing much less are on the same money and new joiners with no knowledge can be on more.
 I personally do not want to leave in the next 6 months atleast due to happy with arrangement of working whilst I get to see my baby at home.
 ​
 Do I do the following
 Tell my manager I feel demotivated due to this.
 Do nothing and do less work
 Do above and beyond on the hope of raise in 3 months.

 The only really thing i'm struggling with is finding some network switches, that doesn't cost a fortune. 
 Anyone have a good idea for a SFP+ switch that can be used for storage, have used Lenovo and Aruba switches for this before, from my old company, but budget is tight. Refurbished is fine for me. 
 Also i also need a layer 3 switch for management network and 1GB ethernet equipment that need to be connected.

 Hey, I'm not a regular here, but right now I'm kind of at a loss.
 I never liked using the cloud service to remote manage, but right now they seem to be down for us and I fail to come up with a plan b that doesn't involve driving over there and using a port.
 Anyone know if you can grab a token from the cloud site and login directly? The http request to their site seems to include one, so they aren't entirely dead I guess.
 thanks, cheers, have a great weekend,

 Im interested in asking what you would say is key knowledge and qualities of a good sysadmin. When i hire developers we usually do a programming challenges is there something similar in the sysadmin space?
 What types of questions would you be interested to ask if you where recruiting a sysadmin?

The client router is in "gateway" mode, and in the network settings the gateway IP is the outside interface of the firewall. We have acl and nat set up to allow the client router port to inside. I can ping the client router from the server router and PC, but not the firewall. I tried trace route, but when I try to reach the other side of the firewall it looks like it does not go through the VPN tunnel. And I cannot ping the outside Interface of the firewall, however ping is allowed for testing. I upload a logical diagram, we would like to RDP from PC-A to PC-B. When I RDP i just enter 192.168.1.6 and it worked before the firewall, now the other side of the tunnel is on another subnet 192.168.50.0 Any suggestions? Should I switch the client router to router mode and create a static route? Why can't I see traffic on the firewall? .

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We all hate them. But we all have 30GB+ shared mailboxes in our environments that we can't eliminate. Or worse shared user mailboxes that are even larger.
 I've done what I can with retention policies and online archiving to reduce the size as much as possible but the performance in online mode is still appalling as you would expect.
 Cached exchange mode is essential for Exchange Online to fix this imo but what about shared folders, are you enabled "Download shared folders"? Enabling it drastically improves shared mailbox performance but at the cost of huge (20GB+) OST files. You could reduce the amount cached to 6 or 3 months but that affects user mailbox caching as well. How are you all handling this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 So we are running a kind of hybrid environment still. Users are created in On-Prem and synced to Azure, Servers are in on-prem and workstations are in AzureAD and managed by Intune.
  
 Currently our minimum password age is at 1 day as per CIS18 1.1.3. But this is causing such a headache.
  
 If a password is reset through Azure AD, like if a supporter resets a passwords and gives to a user. They are not able to change it for 24 hours, since our on-prem AD will not see it as a password set by an administrator.
 Even worse is if the "Force user to change password on next login" is set. Then the user is asked to change their password when they log in, but they are not able to do so, since their password is not more than 24 hours old.
  
 Is there any way around this? I was hoping the minimum password age could be something more reasonable, like 15 minutes or even 30. But 24 hours is just causing such a pain in the ass for support and for the users.

I have a long background in Sys/Network Admin but with this new job as an Applications Manager I've started to learn a lot of DBA skills on the fly. Getting ready for bed I thought "Did I enable archive mode after importing the dump file?". So my anxiety got the best of me. I went to go check and sure enough archive mode was not enabled. So I ran 'shutdown immediate' (which hung for a bit and I thought I was screwed) and then started it up and enabled archive mode. Made some changes in the application and everything appears to be working. Whew! To you experienced DBAs, what would have been the downside to leaving archive mode off? Also, is it worth using RMAN for a 20GB database? The application vendor's DBA helped enable it last year when we moved from on-prem to Azure, but I have no idea how to use it if something went wrong. My plan is to use a BAT script to create a dump file every night in conjunction with Corporate's nightly backups.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was wondering if it was possible to sniff packets over on cellular network, I can't find much information online, so I thought I would ask. Now I know it would be difficult, as you don't have control over the cell tower like you would over your home or business's router, but if you can receive what other phones or cellular capable devices are transmitting couldn't you be able read what is in the packets just like you can in a Wi-Fi network, as you are connected to them? Or is a different encryption key used by each device? And as I haven't been able to find much online, could someone link some information on the encryption methods used on cellular networks? 
 I have one more thing that needs clearing up about cellular networks. What exactly assigns your IP address, is it something at the cell site, meaning your address changes as you change towers? Or is something else responsible for that? And how is data routed to the cell tower, how does it know that your data is intended for it, does it have it's own IP address? If so how does it know in the case of mobile calls and SMS, because as far as I am aware those don't travel over the internet? Again if you have any relevant information that you could link it would be greatly appreciated.

 I work for an MSP, so my scope of knowledge has been very wide. I know I will want to edit it to cater more specifically to each job I apply to, but I do want to have a general resume uploaded to Indeed. Any recommendations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My understanding with something like Zscaler is that it's done by stitching Layer 7 TLS tunnels. There is an App Connector component which functions like a reverse proxy. It sits in front of the application server and establishes outbound connection/tunnel to the Zscaler cloud (Service Edge). On the user's device, the client software also creates an outbound tunnel to the Zscaler cloud. The two tunnels are stitched together by the Zscaler Service Edge. For each client-to-app connection, there is a separate micro-tunnel pair.
 I think Azure AD Application Proxy works in similar way except instead of client software it's just the client's web browser. Basically a client-less version.
 Have I understood this correctly and do all other ZTNA products work the same way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Inspired by the recent post of bombing an interview, for about a thread for the opposite? Mine just happened a couple of weeks ago. I had an overzealous recruiter (in a good way) that checked on me prior to the interview, and promised to call after. Anyhow, the interview is going ok from my standpoint. The questions are really focused on one particular area of expertise, not my strongest but I keep my resume honest and spoke to my knowledge in the area. About 40 minutes inI notice a call from the recruiter come through which of course I send to voice mail. The interview was originally scheduled for a half hour (lol) so I figured she was just being eager to follow up. Anyhow it wraps up about 15 minutes later and I call the recruiter back. She asks me how I thought it went. I said so-so, it wasn't my best interview, but it wasn't a bad one. 
 It turns out that she was calling because mid-interview the interviewer had messaged the recruiter to go ahead and prepare an offer letter. I've got to say that's the first time I received an offer before finishing an interview.
 So, what's your interview that you absolutely nailed?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a linux host with virtual box running a few VMs, one of which is a vyos router. The router has an adapter configured for 172.16.31.10, and a DHCP service to serve IPs on that address. It is bridged to the host ethernet adapter (set to 172.16.31.9) which goes via a switch to a Ruckus WLC, which is connected to an access point. Currently I can connect to the wireless network provided by the WLC, but my PC does not get an IP address on that network at all. The address for the configuration interface on the WLC is 192.168.10.14. Does this need to be set to the 172.16.31.x subnet, and if so should the gateway be the vyos router address? I can only find articles that explain WLCs from a high level, or in depth configuration guides for specific WLCs that assume an in depth knowledge of networking (which I do not have.. only some basics). My current understanding is that the vyos router should serve up IP addresses via the host (since it is bridged) and then the WLC should 'pass that' via the access point to my PC. Since it isn't working I'm guessing that is incorrect, but I don't have enough knowledge yet to know where to start looking for the issue or how to trace it. Any help/advice is much appreciated.

The solution utilizes Palo Alto pre-rules and within them access is either allowed or deny based on AD group membership (or lack thereof).

 Before I get too deep into implementing this over the next several months, I can’t help but feel like this is not very sustainable and that there is a better way to approach this. Any advice?

 ​
 About one in five American workers—approximately 30 million people—are bound by a non-compete clause and are thus restricted from pursuing better employment opportunities. A non-compete clause is a contractual term between an employer and a worker that blocks the worker from working for a competing employer, or starting a competing business, typically within a certain geographic area and period of time after the worker’s employment ends. Because non-compete clauses prevent workers from leaving jobs and decrease competition for workers, they lower wages for both workers who are subject to them as well as workers who are not. Non-compete clauses also prevent new businesses from forming, stifling entrepreneurship,…]]></summary>

 Every job listing in networking seems to emphasizes a high level understanding of OSPF,EIGRP, BGP or other routing protocols. While I have labbed these out for certifications I barely ever have to touch them in production environments. I never had to do translations between these protocols and really the only time I needed to touch them is if I am adding a new network which for the most part is pretty basic. I am just wondering if any of you have a similar experience?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been ~ 2 weeks since LastPass's 2nd breach disclosure(merely 21 days apart from the 1st - 30th November) hit mainstream news.
 Some things to note:
  
Your vault isn't in plaintext. URLs are in Base64 & HEX but passwords ARE NOT. You can confirm this from Mr. Gibson's show notes. They have directions to obtain your vault/blob via a browser - https://www.grc.com/sn/SN-904-Notes.pdf
 LastPass's offsite cloud backup data was exfiltrated. The offsite backup includes backups from their on-premises servers and regional data(required for regions with regulatory reasons)
 You should check your master password iteration counts. If it's 5,000 and you have a short(most likely 8 character password) you might be in pickle. Steve's also explained this and the history of how it came to be in the show notes. Change your master pass immediately to a longer one *and also passwords for individual sites*. Also up the iterations to 350,000.
 If you're an old(started using it circa 2008 - LastPass's start) LastPass user your vault might be a mixture of passwords in CBC & ECB mode. It seems LastPass has left passwords created in CBC "as is" when they realized and shifted to *ECB*.
  
They've made mistakes along the way like having several data breaches. Some are forgivable and can be given a pass. But I do agree with Steve that they should have *automatically "upped" the iterations on Password Based Key Derivation Functions(PBKDF2) for all clients*, Pestered people to shift to longer master passwords on client UIs and lastly, shifted those old passwords from CBC to ECB.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an MPLS connection that I route = specific voice traffic over in one of our India offices. I run EIGRP between the MPLS PE and my core so that when the routes go down that traffic is then routed out the default gateway. This works great for when users were in the office but with the shift to remote/hybrid its causing some voice quality issues for remote users.
 Users have been told to use the tunnel all option to force that voice traffic through the VPN and across the MPLS. Obviously tunneling all their traffic is less than ideal and we get a fair amount of complaints about slow downloads and poor voice quality. We do have split-tunneling but that sends that voice traffic out their local gateways and that can be painful as well. We are doing dynamic split-include for some other domains but without the MPLS need on the backend. 
 What I am trying to figure out is if I add this voice domain to that split include will it route it via the MPLS when the routes are present and out through the ASA when the routes are gone (because MPLS is down)? That domain would be tunnel'd all the time and I simply don't know how it will work when the routes are gone?

 What do you guys think would be some of the most useful things to do in this situation would be? What do you wish your predecessors would have done before they left?
 For background, there are a couple of junior guys, but there is a pretty good experience and training gap between them and me. There are a number of systems that neither of them has ever touched. We have some documentation, but it's pretty basic, mainly just indicating what systems we have, where the backups are, etc.
 I don't know whether the company is going to hire a replacement, promote a junior guy, or something else.
 Edit: I'm leaving because a really good opportunity at an interesting place came up, and not because I'm mad at my current company or anything like that. We are parting on good terms. I have colleagues here that I know well and am on good terms with. I've used some of them as references before, and probably will again.

 We use Office 365 at my org.
 We also have SPF, DKIM, and DMARC, configured.
 I'm analyzing reports using dmarcian and it's showing multiple office 365 servers as failing SPF being unaligned.
 I've already verified that none of my SPF records are >= 255 characters. (we use several "includes"s).
 We do have spf.protection.outlook.com in there as an include. When I look at the report, there are some servers in the 52.100.0.0/14 block are listed as being unaligned, but they are, in fact, in the record.
 Anyone know WTF could be going on here?
 EDIT: Problem solved. See the answer from /u/lolklolk in the thread. Thanks everyone!

 We're looking at ordering an Aruba CX6100 (JL677A). I need it to do 2 or 3 very basic static routes for a small network with relitlvely little traffic. It says its a L2 switch, but the datasheet (linked below) very specifically says:
 "Static IP routing provides manually configured routes" 
 Aruba CX6100 Switch Series - Datasheet (arubanetworks.com) 
 My VAR, though, is saying that this is a misleading statement in the datasheet, and it'll only allow for a single "default-gateway" command and won't in fact route traffic, and that we need to step up to a 6200 if we want any basic static IPv4 routing. 
 Does anyone have any direct experience with this model and can weigh in on its capabilities?

 Now, we have a problem. First of all, it's been replaced only on some of the computers, also in the same Tenant (all have the 2211 version of office, managed updates).
 Second problem... It wants to use Roaming Signatures. THAT feature that MS is trying to implement from july 2021, and it still isn't working. And it always breaks the powershell commands to set signatures for the accounts.
 And with this new screen, it's not possible to select a local signature as default. Only cloud ones. IF you can select one at all. On some of the computers, everything is grayed out.
 And Cloud synced signatures... sometimes they're there. Sometimes an older version is there. Sometimes they're not there at all.

 I have never implemented DKIM nor have any prior knowledge on how email security work when it comes to DKIM & DMARC so please bear with my ignorance.
 I recently implemented DMARC, then discovered that all google calendar invites are going into users' spam folder. I turned it off while I investigate. This article says DKIM must be turned on. I had not set DKIM yet. My question is what could potentially break turning on DKIM? I am not finding any warning online on how this affects email delivery and to prevent chaos.

I could perhaps understand AV on an outside accessible web-server or something, but for internal servers like LDAP, DNS, DHCP, print services, those type of things, I've never installed any extra or 3rd party anti-virus. These days, Windows Defender (or whatever it's called) is pretty great at detecting potentially malicious code/tools, and obviously no end-users are touching these machines.
  
Do any solutions exist that act like an "AV server"? In that, it's a server that perhaps runs a nightly scan on a list of machines, so that a 3rd party AV wouldn't need to be installed everywhere?
 What do you guys do for AV on servers? 3rd party, or Windows Defender enough? Everywhere I've worked we didn't install 3rd party AV on servers. Newest place I work they have Malwarebytes installed on EVERYTHING. They want it replaced with bitdefender and told me to be careful because when they installed Malwarebytes it wreaked havok on the servers, blocking critical services and whatnot. I personally don't want to put bitdefender on the servers, rather just for end-devices. If there's a good cloud or hosted AV solution that can be run from a central server and not be required to be installed to system, that would be cool.

 I'm currently in adoption of some Security Standards, like ISO 27001 and 27701. And there is always the moment that we need to talk about "employee security training and awareness". 
 As in most companies, security isn't a big priority to the employees here. The rule is "the easier, the better", and security falls to the bottom. 
 So, I'm here to ask for some guidance. 
 What are your experiences with Training, Awareness and Education on Security? Both on the perspective of listener and speaker. Which points should I focus? How to make it interesting for the End-Users, and yet, assertive? How to make it work in a non-tedious way?
 And by "Training, Awareness and Education", I mean e-mails, quick tips on security, blog posts, big presentations, gamifications, surveys...
 Thanks :)

 Some help please!!!
 I have been tasked to migrate/consolidate 2 file share server running on Server 2008 to Server 2018. 
 ​
 I have spent some time looking at the Microsoft Storage Migration Service tool, it seems that there are three main tasks to perform 
 1) File Share discovery 2) Copy data from old to new server 3) Final cutover, I notice that the Storage Migration Service tool 
  
doesn't seem to support consolidating multiple file servers into one
 doesn't seem to allow file share migration in a phrase approach, e.g migrate a smaller number of shares first, test/confirm its all working then move on to the next lot. 
  
Am I missing something here? I start to wonder if the Storage Migration Service is the right tool for the task?
 Any help would be much appreciated. 
 ​
 Thanks,

 It's a SMB network in a VERY niche manufacturing industry and the company WILL NEVER become very big. It's about as big as it will ever get. This is fact. Subnet expansion isn't an issue. It will also never expand to other locations. This is purely for compartmentalising interal resources, e.g. servers, phones, laptops, guest wifi, cctv, etc.
 How would you subnet in this scenario?

 I'm writing you this as a rant about Cisco switches.
 What went down? We established a new kronjob on our switches that basically saves the config every week and pushes it to some remote fileserver as backup. 
 What I did not know up to that point: There's a bug in the switches when:
  
C9000 Switches are stacked
 Kron Job with "write" is in the config
  
that causes the switch to crash whenever you want to save the config afterwards.
 "Well that looks like a major oversight and has to be fixed in some point right?" HAHAHAHA
 That bug is known by cisco since May 2019 and there is no fixed version right now. They only tell you to use the EEM instead (wich is a really cool feature ngl)
 To top it all of: There's a chance of the master-switch to crash and reboot when you try to get rid of the config line.
 *sigh*
 Hope y'all had a somewhat chill start in this year. I'm off fixing/restarting switches in our facility...
 On a positive note: Cisco EEM looks really awesome. Will get into that a bit and see what you can do with that.

The answer on the question was to use strings.exe and gave some examples on what to look for from strings' output.
 Some examples given are:
  
InstallShield: "This Setup was created with a BETA VERSION of InstallShield Developer"
 Inno Setup: "This installation was built with Inno Setup"
 Wise: " This installation was built with InstallAware: http:// www installaware com "
  
I'd like to get your inputs on the other tools you know that we can add on this list.
 I'm currently looking at Winrar uninstall exe but can't find any clues on what tool was used to create it, but I know that the install switch is /S. I'd like to build a process where we can have a good guess on what the silent uninstall string are for most programs that doesn't use msiexec to uninstall.

 I want to remove all the mapped drives for the current user when my users are shutting down or restarting their devices. 
 I did a task scheduler that's triggering those actions and did a little cmd file that doing the job. 
 The issue seems to be the account used during the task scheduler. When running with "Builtin\Users" I don't have any errors, but it seems that the script is not running correctly. Using my AD account, everything is working well of course as I have local admin rights. 
 Run only when user is logged on is ticked. 
 Run with highest privilegies is ticked.
 Just doing that in my cmd : 
 net use * /delete /y
 reg delete HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Network\* /f
 In Action tab, I just select my batch file.
 Any idea on how can I solve this issue? 
 Thanks!

 We have 3 sites (A, B and C) all connected by 1GB/s fibre links terminating on Layer 3 switches, the network consisting of 4 distinct subnets separated on the switches using VLANs (1-4 say) with individual switchports belonging to one VLAN (Access) and the link ports being Trunk ports. All working fine when switch A-B was an old Zyxel but this went pop and we replaced with a Dell (set up identically). After the replacement, one of the VLANs (4) on switch B-C (also Dell) stopped working and after a bit of investigation, we realised Spanning Tree had kicked in and stopped all traffic. As we currently have nothing on VLAN 1 on switch B-C we moved the cables to ports on that and all is now working. 
 I've no idea how to even start to troubleshoot this so any ideas would be appreciated. Thanks.

However, on our big 4510 switch - I'm having a hard time. 
 So I guess what I'm asking is - Is this the correct upgrade?

I was presented with this question today and didn't have an answer other than wait for them to come back up. We could disable MFA, but that's a tremendous risk especially in a time when potential attackers know Okta is down.
 I understand this is a tradeoff of going to SaaS and cloud in general. Kind of like asking what do you do when Exchange Online goes down other than wait. Does anyone have an creative ideas or experience here?

 Some of our most capable engineers use linux. They have vastly different preferences in distro etc.
 There are a few paths that we could go down--forcing specific distros on them, having them work in a virtualized environment, etc. but I'm wondering how you folks address the problem of both demonstrating that Linux workstations are compliant as well ensuring functional security measures like full disk encryption are in place.

 Can I just implement QOS on the firewall to do a form of 'packet queuing' prior to traffic reaching the ISP, or must I implement QOS across the entire LAN to get my intended effect?
 
 I have one machine that I want to prioritize over anything else. My LAN is Gig everywhere, but we only have 200Mbps symmetrical for WAN.
 Example: We have 120 Mbps average traffic to internet during business day, and the priority machine wants to use more than the remaining 80 Mbps.
 Firewall is a Sophos XG310. Switches are mainly HP ProCurve, but there are slew of others too. Hoping to not have to futz with all of the switches.

 I'm currently looking at Mist from a wireless perspective. Currently we are an all Cisco shop (Routers/Switches/WLC's/AP's and DNAC for assurance). Would it be possible to run a Mist environment on top of a Cisco switching/routing platform as a POC? I'm thinking more end to end trace clientapswitch>>core. I don't see our org ripping out the Cisco switching/routing but possibly the Wi-Fi as long as I can end to end trace such as what DNAC can provide.

 Thoughts?

 I have a Cisco ASA configured for staff VPN, it's working great. But all of the sudden last night I'm getting a HUGE uptick in event logs from my Domain Controller handling authentication. Typically I see about 100 logs a week or so (we have about 100 employees and connecting to the vpn is not a requirement with remote work). But now it's in the 1,000,000's and is blowing out my cloud logging ingest budget.
 What's odd is I never usually see this AD account log in, but now i'm seeing it all the time, also it's authenticating accounts just fine. Its just being.......extremely noisy.
 I also have not done any changes to the firewall, nor anyone else. I've been on vacation since the middle of December.
 -Rebooted DC's already but it seems like it may have helped a little bit
 Like I said, it's a shot in the dark if anyone had and specific issues with this authentication weirdness, and has any suggestions that would be great!

That said, the data throughput is tiny — a few hundred MB/s max from appx 12-15 devices per switch. Available switch options w/ this PoE++ capability kind of standardizes high bandwidth function, like QSFP or SFP+. Given, the aggregated data flow is far below thresholds for QSFP or even SFP+. Also keeping in mind, the Tx/Rx properties of the modules and mode properties of the fiber are compatible. 
 Now to my query — can an LC QSFP uplink to an LC SFP/SFP+ interface port on the aggregate switch?

 In France we have what we call « croissantage », the principe is if you leave your computer unattended with your session unlocked one of your colleague is allowed to send a message “croissant” to the whole team on Slack (or any IM / email system) and then you have to bring croissants the next morning at breakfast for everyone.
 This is some sort of security awareness but more fun (well not for everyone ofc). 
 So Im trying to find or create a bot / integration on Slack to do that. So far I found this but it’s not free and I’d like to call it “croissant”. 
 Any idea to help me? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What's the consensus on using network segmentation and firewalls to control management access to such devices.
 EG: 
  
Firewall/network equipment management interfaces. 
 Domain controllers (RDP, RPC or WMI etc etc)
 Radius/TACACS services
  
The attempt is to control access (Using identity based access via firewall eventually move to ZTNA) on such devices that manage other services within the domain/LAN but... issues arise when there is only one NIC which is used for access as well as standard service traffic. 
 Is there a clean way to accomplish this? Really easy to do on networking devices, but servers or apps depending on what they are adding a second interface and routing only specific traffic is a toss up.
 Anyone have any words of wisdom or is this a you'll need to build as you go rather than overhaul.
 Thanks in advance.

Mostly looking for your experiences for a single pane of glass for automating and deploying tenants network infrastructure. This is the lay of the land but basically looking at trying to figure out a way to auto spin up firewall instances or at least the configuration piece of this. What have you guys had success with?

 The fix was released in build 9611 (5th september 2022). So hopefully your Passwordstate instances have been updated by now and are not exposed to the internet.
 The CVE was already published December 19th and proof of concept code is available. I was able to confirm the exploit using the proof of concept code.

 Edit:
 Can anyone try this out on their own vulnerable instance? I've only been able to test this yesterday, however my organization has patched the system now. I want to be absolutely sure that this is as bad as it seems.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I worked on a wifi solution several years ago. It was the time the Wireless controller was king and we went with cisco stacks (Catalyst 3850 if I recall correctly) with integrated WLC functionality.
 Despite the AAA complex setup (handled by ISE and Active Directory) we managed to have it working correctly in a very fast way, and it proved solid and stable even after we added a domain trust after a company merge (basically we had two companies wifi SSIDs for both employees PCs, with different certificates and CAs).
 I'm not a Cisco fan anymore (since at least 10 years, after everything became a license), but I must admit that setup was old days(C) cool. 
 ​
 Now I took a glimpse to the current scenario, and everything is cloud based and AI managed and visually simple and <put marketing buzzword here> and shitty shitty shitty no CLI whatsoever and centrally administered (by someone else), microservices (what the hell is microservice for a tunnel?) and cloud-who-cares-where-it-runs.
 ​
 I know this is going to be our (hellish?) future, but I just want to put a couple of stackable switches, run the controller on them and attach (with dual redundant cables, possibly) as many AP as I need or the software allows to.
 Does any of you have a branded, enterprise or at least SMB ready solution, with local, non-cloud based wireless solution?
 I saw Cisco now sells the controller on the APs directly, but besides of a small scale (I could survive), I fear about bad performance and I would need to buy switches (with probably way more horsepower than a single AP) to connect the APs anyway.

 I'm setting up a small non-profit, starting from scratch. Since there will only be 5 users initially and likely no more than 10 in the foreseeable future, I'm questioning whether this office really needs a domain controller. Budget is tight so I'm trying to help as much as I can to save them money and resources.
 All users will have Office 365 accounts, so they will have access to Azure Active Directory. Microsoft gives a nice discount for non-profits, so that certainly helps!
 What's your experience with small offices? What can we leverage from Azure Active Directory to remove the need to an on-site server acting as a domain controller. What about print servers?

I know it's not ideal, but our funding comes from the Government and it's a process to get replacements - besides the fact I think there's an underlying issue since the drive shouldn't be growing like it is. The only thing installed on it is Server 2016, everything else goes to different volumes. This is a classified system, on a private network, so there's very little going on in the background, or there shouldn't be at least. I cannot use treesize or similiar applications because of the security measures in place. Does anyone have any ideas how I can find out what is continuously filling up the drive? I really don't want to have to reinstall the OS. I've done the basics such as clearing caches and disk cleanup, didn't get much help there. I imagine it's some kind of log files, but near impossible to find without the handy apps.
 Thanks!
 ​
 Edit: Just to be clear, I cannot use 3rd party apps to assist(treesize, windirstat etc), or I would have most definitely done this to start. There's a process that has to be taken to classify anything that's put on the network (This is a Goverment Top Secret network). And the mighty overseers of the network will gladly tell me to frig off and just reinstall the OS before they allow it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I apologize if this is a stupid question but I am curious to how this functions.
 ​
 say you are denying all outbound traffic besides services that are required for a server to function, per your software vendor you create some firewall objects (*.SASvendor.com) and create an l3 rule to allow traffic to said vendor. If I were to do an nslookup to get a hostname from that IP that the software is communicating with it resolves a AWS datacenter address, but if I know the address that it is communicating with say... (prod1.SASvendor.com) it resolves to to that IP. I assumed that when the firewall is asked to resolve the DNS record it becomes aware of the FQDN and says ok yep that is good, but my DNS server is not forwarding DNS to the firewall, so how does the firewall know that an IP address is part of the *SASvendor.com domain? I create the rules and it works but I just like to understand how this works..

 However, some computers give me trouble as they are running 16-bit software, on 32-bit XP (and obviously, the software company is long gone, and replacing millions of dollars worth of heavy machinery because the computer shipped with it is too old is not a possibility)
 Moving forward, I can see two ways of doing this: * Windows 10 32 bit, taking advantage of NTVDM to run the app almost natively, but it feels like running straight into the wall, 32-bit OSs are clearly or the future.
  
Using some kind of emulator, like winevdm, to run the application on 64 bit OS, but I am not sure how business ready this tool is, and how reliable it can be for business critical applications.
  
Do you have some feedback you can share ?

 For some background, I'm the sole sysadmin of a <100 person company. We've been mostly WFH since covid, I come into the office when I need. They have been trying to get people to come back 2 days a week, but I haven't seen too many people abide by it. I absolutely dread going into the office, especially as of late. I'm temporarily living about 1.5 hours away from the office with regular traffic and even though I don't go in often, it's slowly draining me. Other than that and the general office time wasters/chit chat, I enjoy the job and people I work for. It's pretty laid back and I get to implement the things I want for the most part. 
 The annoying parts of the j…]]></summary>

 Currently we monitor with reporting from our gateway for internet/vpn activity, CRM with activity logs and selected systems with background monitoring applications. 
 This got the job done with minimal requirements. As we grow, this solution is becoming cumbersome and doesn't fit like needed. What are your suggestions for user / systems activity monitoring? 
 We will be in the range of 50 users, 100 - 125 devices (laptop, desktop, mobile and then some) and about 5 to 7 servers. Would like to have reporting on user or device when needed. Open to looking at any platform. Thanks!

 I've found this interesting post but it only prevents the user from using apps, I want everything to be hidden as well and i don't want the user to be able to "geek" his way through somehow.
 I've also found that you might be able to use SELinux to do something similar ? I am not experienced enough so if anyone know about a good tutorial about SELinux and apps / users restrictions i would gladly take it as i haven't find any satisfying post on the matter yet.

 This is on a Dell PowerEdge R620 server. These servers usually don’t come with a dedicated GPU so in Microsoft for the display card is says “Basic Microsoft Display Adapter”. 
 The Linux installer has a GUI so I’m theory when it boots it should load. I searched the Internet and found out it’s probably a display adapter issue, with most of the “fixes” being to update or install graphics drivers…but I don’t have an nvidia or whatever graphics card to install drivers for. I checked the XFCE server and saw this error (attaching image to this post). 
 https://i.postimg.cc/02gDsq5Q/86-E5976-C-64-EE-44-E2-8452-FC62-E47152-AA.png
 Windows is all up to date, all drivers are good. Upon installing Linux I can do Ctrl alt F3 and get to the CLI to check this stuff. Basically - Kali boots but after the Kali logo (before the log in screen) it just goes to a black screen with a flashing “-“ in the top left. 
 I’ve done these commands sudo apt update sudo apt upgrade sudo apt install update sudo apt install upgrade
 I’ve tried restarting XCFE with the startxfce4 command and then I see the error that it won’t start. I check the log and that’s where I found that error in the screenshot. I’ve reinstalled Kali multiple times to no avail.

 I have an application (Twingate) running at a remote site, which needs to connect to public IP's outbound on TCP 30000-31000.
 Occasionally, and intermittently, Twingate reports that it cannot connect to these IP's on these ports and suggests the ports are blocked. The remote site is within a serviced office. We operate our own firewall, which is connected to some internal/unknown networking at the serviced office, which is handed off to the local carrier. We have a publicly routable IP addresses on our firewall.
 Is there a way to find out which upstream device is blocked these ports?

So my idea was to get Mikrotik Chateau LTE18 as a router, Ubiquiti Networks U6-PRO for the access point, and Cloud Key Gen2. With that would get small UPS to plug it all in that and a small rack to store it.
 ​
 What do you guys think, is that going to withstand 40-50 devices at the same time? Once we get on location we are fixed, and we need our network for all users and their tablets (40-50). Was also thinking about getting some additional LTE antenna if we lack signal quality.
 ​
 Problem is that I read about the chateau sometimes just stop working and needs to be restarted, never used it myself so I'm not sure how reliable is it?

Upon checking the PrestageContent.log it keeps failing with error "SetObjectSecurity failed; 0x8007051b". 
 It runs on an elevated cmd, user is a member of Administrators on the server. I've even tried setting up a fresh dummy DP on a virtual PC and repeated the same thing but I get the same error there too. The dp is "configured for prestaged content" and I am running out of ideas. 
 Anyone here experienced something similar? I've tried googling the error message, seems to be related to admin rights, but I get zero hits on SCCM related errors. I've tried doing this using the local admin account, domain admin account and other members of the Administrators group on the server. The folders on the site all seem to be owned by "administrators" so I don't see why this fails...

 Is there any Vendor that offers APs that can operate as Clients and integrate in a already existing WiFi or is offering WiFi Bridges that can be managed from a Controller?
 I found the Aruba 501 Wireless Bridge, which seems to offer everything we need, but i am not sure if it is manageable from any kind of controller.

 So I am not sure if I am doing it wrong or just not supported (and need to come up with a workaround, I do have other options- including adding a line or 2 into my c# app to create the key on app start).
 So I have a custom-built app that uses a custom URL schema. I am able to register it etc into the registry so someone can type in "coolapp://blah" in start-> run or by clicking on a link in their favourite browser and it would fire up my app and pass on prams etc.
 Now what I need to do is allow Outlook desktop app to open those links without getting this "Microsoft Outlook Security Notice - Microsoft Office has identified a potential security concern." message.
 I can add the custom url schema key in "HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Security\Trusted Protocols\All Applications" and Outlook won't complain anymore for the current logged user.
 Now when I went to put that same key under "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Office\16.0\Common\Security\Trusted Protocols\All Applications" (and remove the one in HKEY_CU) I am finding that Outlook is not picking up the key under HKEY_LM and starts complaining again.
 Am I trying to do something that is not supported or am I putting it in the wrong place?
 I followed this: https://superuser.com/questions/1365501/office-365-ver-1809-how-do-i-specify-trusted-protocols and it got me 1/2 way there - ideally I would like to set it global and be done with it.
 Running GPRESULT /H GPReport.html brings up nothing and gpupdate /force and rebooting didn't help.
 Cheers

 ​
 Your computer can't connect to the remote computer because the Remote Desktop Gateway server address requested and the certificate subject name do not match. Contact your administrator for assistance. When I view the certificate, it shoes the valid remote.mydomain.com certificate.

 What am I missing?

 Adobe Acrobat Reader (Read only)

 Fast ability to search text with CTRL-F in large PDF's (aka textbooks)
  
What is important for me in a PDF Editor:

 Apparently VP saw this somewhere, but I do not think this is possible in vanilla windows 10 LTSC. But I am never going to hear the end of it for the next like week so I thought should through it out into the void and see if it rings a bell for anyone.

 The environment that I work at is using VMware Volumes to deploy web applications such as Chrome, Edge, Etc. I have an application that is installed on the golden image that calls upon the default browser to auto start a web Applicaiton. The instructions stated to put the program installed on the golden image in the "Startup" folder which would normally launch the application. VMware Volumes is not instant and i know that so instead i made a scheduled task to start the program 90 seconds after the initial login (It doesn't actually take 90 seconds for Chrome to appear). The scheduled task runs as the "BuiltIN\Users" group which i assumed would take on whoever actually is logged in sort of like a wild card. I am finding that the application will launch and launch fine when clicking on the desktop icon, but when its ran from the scheduled task it doesn't work properly.
 Is there some other group I can use that would assume the logged in user? Yes i considered writing a simple powershell script or batch script, however both of those are blocked as per domain policy.

I was offered a significant pay increase (think 30-35%). However, I have now heard from both my new supervisor and another source I trust that the position is going to be changed- instead of managing IT for a small department, I would be managing someone doing that role as well as the larger groups main help desk.
 This was never mentioned in the interviews, and isn't something I'm interested in. I had several other offers on the table while searching last year, and have been approached for a number of other positions since accepting this one. I'm torn. On one hand it feels incredibly inconsiderate to immediately turn around and leave...but I was deceived about the true role I would be in.

I need then for VMs, and outside of $200 a piece from MS, I cant find a good way to go about this. Were mostly an Apple shop, but I do have an O365 instance. Also I do not have an agreement with a reseller. TIA for any recs!

Today he called and texted me asking me to call him about our server and backups. No additional info, no emails with details… It’s been two hours and I’ve not called him back.
 I have a lot flexibility where I work but hot damn, I cherish my days off and don’t want work interruptions unless it’s an actual emergency. There are other people on the team that are working today, put their feet to the fire.
 I’m not on call this week. I may regret it but I won’t call him back until tomorrow and just say I had my phone off. I’m tired of this disrespect.

But it feels like there are far too many people who see it as black magic or the next greatest thing without really understanding how it works or what the benefits are. So I want to hear from you. Did you implement a segment routing solution? Why (or why not)? How did it work out for you?

I need to re-setup everything as I want to start using VLAN's. However after reading all the horrible things abut their business practices on deploying firmware upgrades, I don't feel comfortable paying $29 a month for the cloud controller. 
 I've been reading that the Aruba Instant On AP's are good. How are they for someone whose actually a network admin vs just some person who wants an easy to setup WLAN? I'd go with meraki ones if I was actually going to keep the meraki after expiration, but I want to get rid of that piece of garbage. 
 As for size, we currently have about 8,512 SF office space with most of it being open concept with some people in offices. Currently 20 people but planning on growing. Also possibly opening multiple locations world wide so would like to easily control these. 
 Would the Aruba Instant On's be good for this or should I look at something a bit more enterprise? Growth and security are top priority for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a mix of Cisco routers at our remote sites that create either route based or policy based site-to-site VPN tunnels back to our main datacenter firewall.
 The policy based VPNs tunnel ALL traffic back to the datacenter, including Internet. This is done with an ACL like:
 permit ip 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255 any
 Our route based VPNs only tunnel a handful of subnets back to the datacenter. We have static routes like:
 ip route 10.10.10.0 0.0.0.255 Tunnel0
 My question is how would I convert our policy based VPNs into a route based VPN when ALL traffic should be tunneled? If I create an ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 Tunnel0 statement, it would break the current default route for our routers to get to the next hop, which is the ISP router.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey team, remember that flexible work policy we started working on pre Covid and that allowed us to rapidly react to the pandemic by having everyone take their laptop home and work near flawlessly from home? Remember how like 70% of the team moved out of state to be closer to family or find a lower cost of living since we haven't bothered to give cost of living increases that even remotely keep up with inflation? Remember how with the extremely rare exception of a hardware failure you haven't even seen the server hardware you work on in nearly 3 years? Well have I got good news for you! 
 We have some new executives and they like working in the office because that's how their CEO fathers worked in 1954 and he taught them well. Unfortunately with everyone working from home they feel a bit lonely. There is nobody in the building for them to get a better parking place then. Nobody for them to make nervous as they walk through the abandoned cubicle farms. There is also a complete lack of attractive young females at the front desk for them to subtly harass. How can they possibly prove that they work the hardest if they don't see everyone else go home before them each evening?
 To help them with their separation anxiety we will now be working in the office again. If you moved out of state I am sorry but we will be accounting for that when we review staff for annual increases and promotion opportunities, whatever those are. New hires will be required to be from the local area so they can commute and cuddle as well. 
 Wait, hold on one sec, my inbox keeps dinging, why do I have 12 copies of the same email? Oh I see They are not all the same, they just all have the same subject line. Wait! you can't all quit! Not at the same time. Oh good Bob, you were in the office today, wait what's this? Oh Come on, a postit note? You couldn't even use a full sheet of paper?

 I'm working on trying to figure this out but getting stuck on saving the IP of the peer since the variable is a dictionary of dictionaries.

 Should I just replace them all out-of-hand as a few seem to have already failed?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Problem: Need to set up fully redundant nework for NAS/SAN and Hypervisors
 Question: Looking for an affordable, but easy to manage switch/platform that will provide me with a completely redundant network configuration.
 Topology: 
 |--------Primary Router------Switch-----|
 ISP Switch | X | |--------NAS, Hypervisor
 |---------Backup Router------Switch-----|
 NOTE: Routers have connections to both switches, and switches have connections between each other. This is the only way I can think to be redundant in the event that 1 switch goes down. I don't have a fully VRRP router setup, just online/standby. One router has to go down completely before the second kicks in.
 ​
 Additional Background:
 I have a iXSystems X20 NAS with 2 controllers running on my network. I have been running into issues where the NAS will freak out and drop all connections when there is a change on the local network (switch firmware update or VLAN changes). I am currently using a UniFi Switch Aggregation switch to connect the NAS to my ESXi hypervisors.
 I am hoping to solve this issue, but I am not familiar with every redundancy technology. I know I will probably need to purchase other switches, but need to know where to start looking and what other people have in their setups.

For example, we have 2 offices on the east and west coast in the US and 3 offices in Asia. Is it advisable to have a separate VNet for each office or would you setup VNets for multiple offices in generally the same geographical area? Interested to know people's thoughts...

 Me, fighting through an aneurysm: There are no receipt emails in $user's account. However, there is an exchange between you and $user where you signed off on using $user's personal email for the subscription.
 HR: I'm aware of that exchange. Thanks for checking.
 So, to recap:
  
All of $user's accounts have been active for 3 weeks since their departure.
 I have no idea where user's equipment is.
 HR is co-signing subscriptions tied to personal email addresses.

 But this keeps happening.
 I am part time IT support for a location as the ownership is still too damn cheap to transition me to full time hours and benefits despite our business picking up after Covid.
 So I work my three days and have been for over a year.
 But dumbasses on site who got a hold of my number as management shared it like chickenpox call me at all hours of the day "Taco are you on site?, Taco are you working today ?, Taco have you seen the ticket I submitted 3 nanoseconds ago (if they even send in a ticket) ? Taco something IT knows is a issue but they keep getting denied the budget to fix is broken , what's your backup plan ? "
 ​
 Its freaking frustrated none of them seem to have any respect for my private life, 3 times this morning I was woken up while still in bed (now to be fair one of those was Oracle (and that's its own rant that they don't seem to ever check time zones for gods sakes )), i get called at like 2AM by the night shift staff and there's no empathy there, no apology for waking me up in the dead of the night, instead "why are you always so grumpy when I call? "
 I don't know jackass, maybe its because its been a long week and I am trying to sleep and you call me for your petty shit!!!
 ​
 Sigh...I need to get out of that place, its going to kill me with stress if I let it out.
 And I will smile and laugh as things go to hell without me there, as the only other IT person for the organization is 2 hours drive away with good traffic. Not the location, the Organization, a organization with locations on 2 continents.
 That is how goddamn cheap they are.
 What about the rest of you, anyone else got cases of being treated like crap with your phone and personal life ?

Currently, i'm working on a project to put as many of our systems as possible through our Duo Network Gateway (DNG from here forward). 
 The end goal is to put every administrative interface behind the DNG while we implement Zero Trust. (Being inside or outside the org doesn't mean I trust you, there is no inherently trusted device.) To reach a device you first need to use a MFA secured portal to verify your identity. 
 As part of this we are attempting to move our VMWare vSphere web interface behind our DNG, it appears natively this is not supported so we are first going through a NGINX reverse proxy to present a single supported web interface.
  
Here is the config needed in NGINX to make this work for all parts of vSphere…]]></summary>

Over the Christmas period BBC iPlayer, ITV Player and even Prime video started blocking all devices on our network from accessing content. On all services I get messages saying we are either not in the UK or using a VPN. We are based in the UK with a static IP address from a UK based ISP. We don't send our traffic out through a proxy server or a VPN at all (although we do have one remote user who gets into our network through a VPN to our Router). Does anyone know what it is about our IP address or network that would cause this? Any ideas why we are getting flagged and how to fix would be appreciated.

 The logs look like below
 Dec 30 18:48:04.400 UTC: %SEC_LOGIN-1-QUIET_MODE_ON: Still timeleft for watching failures is 0 secs, [user: foo] [Source: 192.168.1.5] [localport: 443] [Reason: Login Authentication Failed - BadPassword] [ACL: sl_def_acl] at 13:48:04 
 Here's the thing though, we are a strictly class A 10.0.0.0/8 network. There isn't a single 192.168.1.0/24 network in our enterprise. So I'm kinda stumped on how this is happening and what I should do. 
 I think I'd like to just turn on having 443 available for login, because I don't really use it.
 Thoughts?

Used their stupid SARA tool to uninstall and reinstall
 Updated the registry to force modern authentication
 Fully updated the machines
 Removed the "work or school" profile
 New user profile and new email profile.

Mid morning today it started showing as offline on all PCs, despite us being able to access it's web GUI and ping it. We were able to add it again via WSD, but not via IP. After some googling we found that changing it over to from RAW to LP and a few other settings fixed it.
 I'm curious as to why there might be a sudden change. I thought an over the air update to printer, but can't see anything in it's logs to suggest that might be it?

 I imagine Windows recently made an update that caused this malfunction..?

 I cut off the ends of the cables and have been struggling to terminate them correctly. My uncle says it’s impossible and that I used the wrong cable …I’m determined to terminate these without having to run new wires…
 He claims the gauge of the wires in the flat cable are too small and that the rj45 connector pins won’t bite fully into them when they’re crimped. This seems to be the case because every time I terminate one, the results on the tester keep changing.
 Is there any way I can terminate these ?! Is there a special rj45 connector I’ve never heard of?
 Thanks so much!

 These logs are filling up a lot of space in Splunk, and so our security asked us to track down the cause. I've seen this come up a lot online, but the only real solutions I've seen is to turn off auditing, but that will then flag us for not following STIG.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my wife and I were looking for a project to work that we could leverage to possibly help us in our business and upskill some of our SWE skills. We have begun to try and centralize our organization's (and other organizations that we work with) communication and kind of command center on Microsoft 365 and specifically Teams, but augmented by the whole ecosystem. In our opinion, it makes things simpler for many users, and we have been decently happy with Microsoft products over other vendors.
 We decided to develop a ticketing system/helpdesk software. Obviously this is a crowded space, but we could only find one other option that allowed you to work with the tool in any serious way inside of Teams. We are planning to add some other features that may be less focused on with the bigger brands as well, but overall it will be a simple, affordable, SaaS that can be utilized through a web browser on our standalone site OR entirely through Teams - for both the technicians and the end-users.
 This started out (and has been a great success!) as just wanting to build something that we would at least use and that we could learn from. However, as we build it out more - I am wondering if:
  
This is something you or anyone you know would actually use/like? 
 What additional features would you love to see in a product like this?
 Would you pay for it?
  
Appreciate your thoughts, have a good day!

 I'm looking for a solution for creating forms - mainly for manual check-ups on hardware and software.
 I have tried Acrobat Pro DC, but it seems rather tedious and the text-formatting is unstable, at least when I edit or try to move text-fields and so forth.
 Essentially what I am looking for:
 - Offline (If possible)
 - If/Else (Example: Ability to hide text-fields unless a checkbox is checked)
 - Export to PDF when filled.
 - Easier scripting for the if/elses?
 I thought an interactive PDF would be the easiest way to accomplish this, does anyone know any better or is Acrobat perfectò?
 We have M365, can is Microsoft Forms good enough for this?
 Greets!

 im a sysadmin (mostly windows) and my coding is mostly limited to powershell, although i learned a bit of C a long time ago and dabbled with C#.
 Now i want to develop a small tool that does the following:
 - running as a service on a windows machine- accept commands (via REST-API would be best i think?)- execute PowerCLI Cmdlets (Powershell)
 Im not really well versed in .NET programming. My first instinct was to write a Powershell-Script and let it run as a service by a tool like nssm or use something like Powershell Universal. Then i found out you can run ASP.NET core in a windows service. Not shure how to execute powershell from this though.
 Maybe someone has advice about which technique would be the best for my task? Or maybe there is a framework or tool that already does what i want?
 /edit
 Ok here is what i want to do:
 We have a monitoring system that can do rest calls. When the status of certain monitored asset changes i want it to send a rest call to my service. When all of the monitored assets are down, i want my service to shut down specific VMs through powercli.

 Admins have quite high privileges to servers. As Microsoft best practice suggests, their domain user (domain.com\admin) high privilege account which they use logging to PAW has no local Administrator privileges.
 Now there is situation when those same level/tier PAW-s need to be managed/administered by some of the same level admins. For example execute Powershell scripts on those PAW-s remotely, access ADMIN$ shares, etc... Looks like another domain user (domain.com\paw_admin) is needed for them which has to be inside domain group (domain.com\paw_administrators) which is member of local Administrators group. Nobody wants to have many MFA tokens.... Am I missing something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have set up private endpoint for various Azure resources (SQL Server, Web Apps etc.) and set up conditional forwarding to the Azure wire server within our DNS configuration.
 A ping resolves to the private IP of the server (i.e. that of the private endpoint) when testing from Azure VM's within the VNET, but when testing from local machines, it seems to flip flop between returning the private IP and returning the public azure endpoint, meaning I can sometimes connect through to these resources from my machine (when the private IP is being returned) and sometimes not (when the public IP is being returned).
 We have our local machines pointing at Cisco Umbrella for their DNS resolution already, and have therefore opted to have the relevant azure endpoints forward onto our VM-based DNS servers using Umbrella's in-built DNS forwarding capabilities. 
 If I test through this method I can replicate the issue, if I override this method using my hosts file (pointing the relevant URL's directly at their private endpoint IP address), it works consistently, suggesting the issue is with Cisco Umbrella, and it is not consistently handling the requests.
 Any ideas on how to resolve this?

 I currently have a portacabin set up with a slow (4-7 Mbps) DSL line and I am looking for advice on the best way to upgrade it. My options have been presented as follows:
 1) point to point wireless connection - this could be an effective way of connecting portacabin to base office but I am concerned that the large ships around the operation could adversely affect the connection.
 2) Ethernet circuit (leased line) - I have been advised this is a costly option.
 3) Starlink connection. Not a great match with our current Watchguard Firewall as it's a bit of a pain to configure but is probably one of the better options in my opinion.
 Interested to hear what professionals/experts have to say about the above. Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Reaching out here as my Google-fu seems insufficient for getting my head wrapped why and how this is happening.
 We run RDS farms with RDGateway/RDBroker services. Recently we decided to decommission some of the older RDGW servers as they were unstable and poorly documented, and set up new ones.
 They work as expected, except for the fact that a handful of end users somehow have created full local user profiles on the new RDGW servers... It seems to be completely random, and it's only about 8-10 accounts out of thousands that access the farms. The profiles are empty, and they have functioning/actual profiles on their respective collection session hosts. Creation date is between 0-4 days from when the new RDGW servers were put into production, and no new profiles have appeared since.
 Anyone know what could cause this? Any setting in user object and/or collection(s) that might trigger this behavior?
 Any help appreciated.

 I hope that everyone has a good new year.
 I was wondering If I could get feedback from the community about my resume.
 Currently I'm looking for a remote Linux sysadmin or possible a junior DevOps position in Europe.
  
I am currently getting my CKS and an AWS certificate. Should I put them in my resume and saying that I'm currently pursuing them or would you advice not to?
 I spoke with a recruiter and he said that my projects are not "mature" enough, I asked for feedback but didn't hear anything back. What would be considered a "mature" project in your eyes?
 Did I list to many projects? I have a portfolio but I noticed that no one was looking on it.
 Would you think I could get a remote job in the United States as a 1099 contractor or is that to early?
  
Again, thank you for your input!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have a but of a mystery regarding my network, where devices in my network are not capable of accessing a web service which is outside the network, on port 80/443. The service is otherwise reachable from everywhere else (my home network, LTE, etc.).
 The network has 1000 IP's on the same subnet and all devices in the network are behind a Debian firewall running iptables. All outgoing traffic is allowed and likewise for established connections.
 In particular, I have no problem reaching other instances of the same service on those ports from devices in the network. To my knowledge there is no iptables rule that precludes accessing the web service from my network.
 When I run tcptraceroute from a device within network, the tail of the trace is identical to running it from a device outside of the network with the exception that the last hop to the server with the web service is missing. To me this points to the packet being dropped by the server.
 Does this point to a misconfigured iptables on my end or could the problem be that the packets are rejected by the server running the web service when it belongs to my IP range? Everything has worked fine until recently. Port scan shows it runs IIS and only ports among top 1000 that are open are 80 and 443.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for a school system, and foolishly installed the December updates before I left for Christmas break. I didn't notice any issues immediately, and honestly, I'm not sure if the updates are even related.
 I run Windows 2022 Server on Dell hardware. I have 3 Hyper-V VMs on that. A domain controller that does DHCP and DNS, a storage server, and a "support" system that I use for troubleshooting. The support system will not get a DHCP address from the server, which is connected to the same virtual switch.
 I read about the issues with the Dec update and Hyper-V, but I thought it was for newly created VMs. I went ahead and applied the OOB patch to the host anyways, but no luck. I then uninstalled the updates, no luck. I had DHCP failover setup, so I removed that, no luck. Thinking that maybe something with my scopes was corrupted, I loaded a backup, no luck.
 The odd thing is that the server gets the request, assigns an IP, which shows up in the leases, but the support system never receives the IP. I do have firewall enabled on the server, but outbound shouldn't be blocked. I can use our Meraki switches to give out DHCP addresses, and the support system gets that with no issue. I can ping the DHCP server if I set an IP on the support system. I have 11 servers, 9 of them appear to have this issue, but all were updated at the same time (I think the other two are working, but haven't worried about those until I figure the others out). I actually may have fixed one of them, doing the above...but doing the same to another server didn't help. So I'm thinking it was a fluke, or I didn't find the right combo.
 I'm hoping someone has seen something similar, and can point me in the right direction.
 Thanks

 That was one of the worst stretches of on-call I ever had, it was with a mid-sized company that had a shit infrastructure and poor management that was always in react mode and slapping bandaids on everything instead of fixing it. I wasn't even a sysadmin there, but my jobs would get impacted every time they had an outage that would have me spending a couple of hours figuring out what data was janked up. That was also the shortest stint of any job I worked, in and out in less than a year but I was called after hours every freaking week.

 I've been in IT for about 25 years, I am thoroughly a Generalist, but the last 15 years has been SysAdmin / IT Manager with maybe 15% time in the field- racking new gear, replace a few AP's, pull a few Cat 6 drops. I've done maybe 1000 terminations in my time. So I don't consider myself an expert when it comes to structured cabling and termination.
 I am preparing to help a church do a network reset and need some advice on some particulars. Up until a couple months ago I would not have told you that I had a preferred brand of Cat5e / Cat6 keystone jack, but on that job I had to terminate a dozen Cat 6 cables to jacks and was provided Panduit brand jacks. I felt like they were easier for me to terminate than anything I had used before.
 With that being said I wonder if you experienced folks have a preferred brand or model of jack? I estimate there will be around 150 keystone terminations to do with the church job, and I will be installing these into modular (blank) patch panels.
 I would like to try out the JackRapid tool, and see that it has versions for many different jacks, anyone have good or terrible experience with the tool itself? 
 Does anyone know the practical differences between Leviton 5g108 vs 5g110? 
 Is there any reason to consider Cat5e these days or should I just go straight to Cat6? Is there a cable brand that is preferred, with regards to colors being clear and easy to see, cable not too bulky, etc?
 Thanks for any advice!

Our suites can be locked up though any time we want. In the common area of the building on the second floor is a wall for bikes and on one wall is all the ISP demarc equipment for all the tenant. Since we opened our office back up this has been a massive red flag to me since we have had homeless people barricade themselves in the bathrooms of our building. It would be quite easy for someone to just disconnect, break, or steal the equipment on the wall, nothing is locked in any enclosed racks. 
 I'm writing our building management about this problem and telling them these are my concerns but are there any building codes, or legal requirements to put this equipment in a room that's access controlled or at least locked enclosures so it's not just exposed to anyone walking down our halls I can use to back up my concerns?

 When you see a DKIM signing, you see a that a particular domain has signed the email.
 However, from where the domain in the “d=“ is taken from? 
 Is it like the SPF, which points to the Return-Path domain?(envelope from(SMTP Mail From)? 
 Or the domain in the d= can be taken from the “Header From” as well? Though it would not make any sense because then every domain that will be attempted to spoof, we see it’s DKIM signature.
 So whenever a message has been signed with a DKIM of a particular domain, and let’s say that the DKIM header was not “added” by forging, it means that I can stay “calm” and realise that it was really sent from a valid domain because it means the return path is that domain?
 (Not including BEC)
 I know what DKIM does, I just wanted to know where that domain in the d= comes from exactly.
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Coming into a new work environment and I noticed that first user logon takes about 4-5 minutes.
 I turned on Windows logon verbose logs and I noticed that the "Apply Group Policy Registries" step would take the most time to complete.
 ​
 GPOs were created originally by a third party. 
 Looking at the GPOs, I see that the third party created 100+ registry items which I assume is the culprit. These are all user policies.
 Examples of Registry items that are being deployed via GPO:
 (Note: 95% of these GPOs are set to run Apply One and do not reapply)
 Windows Icon Size
 Startup Page
 TaskbarAnnimations
 ​
 My thinking is to write a powershell script or create a .REG file and import these settings into the Default User registry Hive to save time.
  
Is this (manually adding the registries to the default user) the best approach to mitigate the slow logon time caused by lots of GPO registry items
 If I manually make these changes (powershell, .REG), and still keep the GPO Registry items, will the group policies see that the key, item already exists and skip the step, or will it just continue to run and apply the registries (write over my work)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This probably isn't a true /r/sysadmin worthy request ... but I'm hoping another admin has run into this before.
 Long background exists but the short story is that the former owner of the company was allowed to keep his company email for a lot longer than it should have been allowed. As a result he is now an over 70 year old gentleman and dependent on everything remaining as close to the same as possible. We have multiple insurance/regulatory/compliance requirements that say we need him migrated off ASAP. Current mailbox is in on-prem exchange ... size is roughly 15gb.
 My original plan was to have him get a gmail address, export his mailbox to a PST file and ship it to him to use inside Outlook. He flipped out that he wouldn't have his *extensive* folder organization system available on all his PCs/mobile devices like he does now. Current owner wants me to find a solution that would make it work with the least amount of friction possible.
 So thats the backstory ... now to solutions ... I'm open to anything that gets this resolved with the least amount of a 70 year old swearing at me and my helpdesk tech. 
 Can we upload his PST file into Office 365 Business either manually or through some wizard? Even just folder copying for him if need be.
 Any slicker solution you can think of?

 -A FORWARD -m conntrack --ctstate DNAT -j ACCEPT
 it means that it accepts packets that have had their destination address updated by the NAT, but im confused about when the NAT updates the destination address.
 Say this is the NAT table:
 NATed Address NAT-host Address Destination Address 192.168.1.2:53452 x.x.x.x:53452 8.8.8.8:53 
 the x.x.x.x would be the public address of the NAT router.
 So if the NAT receives a packet with destination x.x.x.x:53452, does it ONLY update the destination IF the source address of the packet is 8.8.8.8:53? What if its 8.8.8.8:2000? What if its 1.2.3.4:8000, but still destined for x.x.x.x:53452?

That school is only teaching programming. I'm pretty good at JavaScript and am starting to learn python now.
 My dyslexia and dyscalculia have made programming very challenging. Still, I'm now pretty good ( not close to job-ready) at it, but I'm interested in learning cybersecurity. I'm not a native English speaker, and if I'm reading something for English text, I'm using like 80% screen reader. My dyslexia is very severe.I understand that because of these learning disabilities, I will never be a very competitive programmer in the job market. I'm okay with that.

I've been meaning to do this for years, but I bastardized it for SysAdmins and bought it up to date. Hope you enjoy it!
 ​
 Real SysAdmins don't eat quiche. They like Twinkies, Coke, and palate-scorching Szechwan food.
 Real SysAdmins don't write application programs. They program right down to the base-metal. Application programming is for dullards who can't do automation.
 Real SysAdmins don't write specs. Users should be grateful for whatever they get; they are lucky to get support at all.
 Real SysAdmins don't comment their scripts. If it was hard to write, it should be even harder to understand and modify.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys
 I work for a large company with a not so huge corporate network footprint. It's not medical, it's not government. But they have to work or we potentially lose a ton of money. We manage about 8 FortiGate firewalls in our realm and I just do not see eye to eye with the other engineer.
 So this persons process is this: We have 6 versions to go through to get the version we want. These are important firewalls as far as our traffic flow goes and all have HA redundancy.
 The engineer will backup and compare configs and run tests after each firmware update. That means 6 times we do this to ONE firewall before we reach the version we want. 48 times all together for the whole network.
 On each incremental update we test all functionality, then let it "run" like that for a day or two, fill out a checks form then upload our configs then do it again for the next incremental update.
 Am I losing my mind here? Why are we not doing incremental upgrade, run a config comparison then upgrade to the next until we are done and then do our final checks on the final revision. It would take an hour instead of a week. Am I being too relaxed? I've probably upgraded thousands of these things in my life but this is the first time I seen someone do this so manually and labor intensive and slow. Everything this person does is done manually with a mouse and a gui.
 How would you handle this knowing a zero day vulnerability has been exposed? Does anyone do it to this tedious of a process?
 Open to convo and opinions on the process. This isn't the first time I've disagreed but I want to hear your experience be it fortigate or Cisco or whatever.

In either situation, traffic will be traversing through a third party's network (a service provider)... and isn't the whole idea that you don't want these third parties to be able to see/alter your traffic?
 The internet would pose a greater risk, of course (with traffic traversing many different service providers as opposed to just one... potential for BGP shenanigans too)... but, the risk still seems to be there with MPLS.

 Reason for switching is due to cost - very expensive for our needs. Looking for something similar to Zendesk with good reporting tools and automation.
 Zoho seems to be the best bet as it looks like a complete clone, even coming with an import function for Zendesk.
 Freskdesk is another one I keep hearing about.

 I have a problem with the delegation of mailboxes. 
 Many times in the new admin center when delegating an email box to a user, I give access to the user, the service says it may take up to 5min but the fact is that the box does not appear in the user's Outlook and if I go back to the delegation part the access does not appear, as if it was never given.
 However, in the classic version of Exchange (ECP), the access appears as given. This has been happening for a few months now with some mailboxes, but there isn't exactly a pattern.
 Does anyone have any idea what it could be?
 Thanks!

 I looked into various tools but nothing really convinced me. I have only basic requirements right now: get windows events, filter out the few we're interested in from the application, and make them available, e.g. a CSV file on a share.
 Recommendations for this scenario greatly appreciated.

 i am using HP CMSL during my SCCM OSD deployment to fetch the latest version of HPIA on my new computers. This works fine.
 In the next step i am running HPIA silently to install all CRITICAL components - which is working fine as well.
 At that point i am wondering if i oversee something or if the CLI options offer less then the UI of HPIA.
 UI
 In the UI i can select for example a subset of:
  
CRITICAL
 UPDATE RECOMMENDED
 INSTALL RECOMMENDED
 ...
  
While i would like to have:
  
CRITICAL 
 UPDATE RECOMMENDED
  
but not
  
INSTALL RECOMMENDED
  
simply to avoid bloatware being added. So in the UI i can select fine-tuned what to do.
 ​
 CLI
 In the cli manual (http://ftp.ext.hp.com//pub/caps-softpaq/cmit/whitepapers/HPIAUserGuide.pdf) i can only find the following
  
ALL
 CRITICAL
 RECOMMENDED
 ROUTINE
  
so no way to differenciate between
  
UPDATE RECOMMENDED
 INSTALL RECOMMENDED
  
Am i reading it wrong or is the CLI offering less then the UI?

 So, I spinned a lab for a test, and there are some problems:
  
after update install, access to 2003 share by name was lost (expected). RDP login is working. Hosted application works.
 after settings DefaultDomainSupportedEncTypes to one of values 0x3F, 0x1F, 0x1C login to server breaks. Both RDP and console login. 
  
It only works with default value 0x27.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been tasked with architecting an SD WAN appliance that supports bonding, automatic failover, and use of GPS location to dynamically enable/disable a WAN connection.
 The basic requirement is for the system to support up to four gigabit WAN connections and disable one or more based on GPS location. The stretch goal is for the same device to support Multipath TCP so that traffic can be routed over multiple WAN links and recombined at a cloud server.
 The purpose is for a system installed in a vehicle that can leverage multiple different WAN links (5G, Starlink, Wi-Fi) to maximize bandwidth, provide seamless failover, and disable certain WAN links (Starlink and/or 5G) when operating in areas where the service is unavailable or not approved for use.
 I have prototyped these technologies individually using a Linux PC, but I need to find a reliable hardware + software platform for a production industrial grade system. If you were tasked with such a project, what platform would you chose to build it on?

 I would like to discuss Azure Pass-through authentication. 
 My understanding is that:
 a) All password validation requests are sent to Windows Server Active Directory via Pass-through authentication, and Active Directory is the actual place where auth occurs. So, with this in place, I could run scripts against Active Directory to look for dormant/inactive user accounts that have not be used for x days, and have them removed afterwards 
 b) For AAD Guest accounts, the identity provider, or authentication system would be Azure Active Directory 
 Are my assumptions correct?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a firewall you have a routing table and a policy. The routing table is used to determine what traffic goes to what next-hop IP-address or interface, and a policy is used to specify what traffic is allowed through the firewall. 
 Now a colleague of mine has come up with the idea to start using policy-based routes instead or normal routes as an extra layer of security. The idea is to use policy-based routes to specify which sources (subnets or interfaces) are routed to specific networks. His argumentation is that if you make a mistake in the firewall policy and accidentally allow too much traffic, the PBR rules will prevent the traffic to being routed to the addresses it shouldn't be allowed to reach. 
 This to me sounds like a really bad idea, and makes an already complex network more overly complex. I have never seen PBR being (mis)used for something like this. What are your thoughts about this and using PBR as a security measure instead of a tool for traffic flow management?

 We have an existing 2016 box we are going to retire. It's within one of our own networks in another region. It employs most of the STIG rules. It is domain joined.
 We use this for:
  
Jumping into routers
 Jumping into restricted VMs/Infra
  
With the new host, I have a couple of questions:
  
We're looking to move it to Azure so if anything in our network is compromised, we still have the jumphost for admin functions
 Domain joined or not to be domain joined - just becomes a headache around administering it
  
Any other suggestions you have would be welcomed.

 I know there are the big players like Aruba and Juniper Mist, but the thought of a cloud vision managed VXLAN campus + wifi is intriguing to me. Arista seems to be the best folks to do it, given their roots in DC networking.

 I have 2x Dell PowerEdge R740 (just 1 year old) with Seagate HDDs (DL2400mm0159, SAS 10K 2.4TB) with RAID-5 (1 hot spare) configuration.
 Past few months, I've been experiencing multiple disk failures. Since Oct 2022, so far at least 10 disk failures on two different servers. 5 disk failures on each server..
 I replaced disks (when it failed), physically replaced PERC H750 RAID Controller, upgraded firmware of HDD & BIOS as well but disk failure has been happening randomly on different slots and today another one just failed. Dell Tech support says they do not perform any root cause analysis of HDD failure and does not provide me with any reason for this massive failure. 
 Any idea why disks keep failing?

 My company has tens of thousands of photos, dating back decades, scattered across local file servers, SharePoint sites, and Box accounts. After reorganization attempts from several marketing people, it has gotten to the point where people can rarely find the photos they are looking for if they don't already know exactly where to look.
 I'm looking for software that will scan the media in its existing location and build a searchable database based on the file's metadata. Ideally it could use AI to allow users to search for subject matter. I would also like it to allow things like tagging, rating, and favoriting media.
 In my searching, I have come across Digital Asset Management software, but I'm struggling to get my head wrapped around what they actually do. It seems like they are trying to be more of a wholesale replacement for a file share, but I can't really tell.
 Any advice on if software like this exists or on best practices for managing a large media catalogue with multiple users and contributors.

I’m a new sys admin at our company which is very cloud-focused and we’ll be inheriting an HPE server with Server 2019 and Hyper-V installed with 4 VMs on it. We’ll need to implement our own alerts to let us know if the Hypervisor or any of the VMs go offline. Something to note is that there is a plan in place to migrate these VMs to Azure or shut them down completely if we don’t need them within the next few months. So we’re looking for more of a cheap stopgap than anything. 
 I was thinking of setting up Azure connection monitoring to accomplish this since I see you can also monitor on premise machines. But if there’s something better available that fits this scenario, I will look into it. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm an individual contributor at my organization. A previous manager and I had a conversation once about pursuing a Management position vs remaining an individual contributor (Admin/ Engineer/ developer etc...) position.
 ​
 Basically it boiled down to my manager saying that remaining in technical roles can be more rewarding than going into people management type positions. Siting that high level individual contributors have high salaries than management people. I find this hard to believe. From my perspective, no manager would ever make less than their direct reports because of the mindset "They report to me, I'm high in the org chart, therefore I'm more valuable." 
 ​
 Difference between the roles aside, Is there any truth in this? Can any of the individual contributors out there confidently say their salary is higher than their manager? Was remaining a system admin more lucrative for you? For those that made the switch from an admin to a people manager, do you have direct reports that make more than you?

 The problem is, when you have about 100 of these switches (mix of SG300, SG350 and the new CBS350 of various sizes and PoE/non-PoE) and they all need pretty much the same configuration save for some special use access ports..... do you guys/gals use any special tools to bulk configure them?
 I've done some crude automation with DHCP Options / TFTP and a gold config file, but once you need to start tweaking the individual switch it all goes manual.
 And please don't ask me to use FindIT, or Cisco Business Dashboard, or PNP, or whatever half-baked tool Cisco decides to stick into these switches... I'd like something where I take a switch out of the box, stick it in the network, it gets autodiscovered then I can configure it and maintain it almost entirely in bulk.
 EDIT 1: I already have the initial config sorted. Like I said I can do it with a golden config file, DHCP Options and TFTP. This is fine. My question is about follow up config changes, monitoring, config backups, and individual port configurations.
 EDIT 2: Basically I’m looking for a “WiFi controller for switches” for these models. Aruba, Ruckus, Cisco Catalyst, Cambium, Meraki - they all have some form of centralised controller… I’m looking for something similar for these switch models.

 At this point I'd like to start from scratch and work my way up as I can't even get a simple data VLAN working correctly.
 Here's what I would like to do to start.
 There is a Sonicwall TZ370 firewall (acting as router) and a D-Link DGS-1100 switch. Modem plugs into X1 WAN port on SW. X0 Lan port on SW is plugged into port 1 on switch.
 The main company network is 192.168.1.1
 I would like to create a Data VLAN 20 at 192.168.20.1 which assigns IP address in that range when plugged into port 7 of the switch
 I have create a virtual interface in the Sonicwall (X0:V20) and assigned it 192.168.20.1 and set up a DHCP lease range, 192.168.20.2-254
 In the switch there is a default VLAN0001 with all 24 ports untagged, Native VLAN (PVID) checked, and all ports set to hybrid.
 I created a VLAN 20 Data. Here's where I get confused. What do I set port 7 as? I have tried all options. 
 When I select tagged or untagged, Internet works but I still have 192.168.1.1 address. Not sure what I'm missing.
 Any ideas? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So in the new year I’ve decided I should improve the security for our Veeam Backup infrastructure by deploying a dedicated AD Domain just for the Veeam servers to live on. It got me thinking, should I also move vCenter authentication over to only using this new domain, should I point it to both domains, or should I leave it as it is on the production domain?
 Looking to minimise the chances of lateral movement within the network from bad actors by making sure compromised credentials from the production domain can’t be used to tamper / impact the backups. There’s already a bunch of physical servers acting as repositories / tape servers and a number of VMs acting as proxies and data movers(in addition to the Veeam Management VM), so adding an extra couple VMs hosted on the physical repository servers will maintain the physical separation.

 Border agents have the upper hand, you can be detained and your devices seized. Key disclosure laws make it legal to force you to surrender your passwords and biometric access. Back up your devices, use encrypted cloud storage, wipe and factory reset your device, create new travel accounts, restore your devices when you reach a safe network.

Recently started a new work with a much bigger team than my previous job. While discussing with my manager about plans for outages during the holiday, he said he’s not expecting to be able to reach me not anyone. They have a small team dedicated for such outages as first responders. 
 So this holiday has been the most quiet holidays I have had for the past half a decade. No email addressing to me. No server alerts. Nothing. Feel surreal. Gave me time to binge on a few anime I missed.
 With that said. Happy holidays and new year to everyone. For those that have to work, best of luck to you all!

 So I have been thinking of doing a career change to System Administrator or Cloud Engineer/Architect and I'm wondering what my first steps should be. 
 I currently hold a bachelor's in Aerospace Engineering and a master's in Mechanical Engineering. I currently work as a Systems Engineer (not IT Systems Engineer) in the defence sector where I do various work from designing to testing of naval military equipment. I have 2 years of experience after graduation. None of my work experience is related to System Admin or Cloud Engineering. 
 I have done some research and found that I should probably start with some of the certifications listed below: 
 Solutions Architect Associate
 Solutions Architect Pro
 Data Analytics Specialist
 Azure Fundamentals
 ​
 Will getting these certifications be enough to land a job at one of these positions? Should I do anything else to stand out? Any help is greatly appreciated.

My current salary, senior systems administrator, is $110k which for here in Ohio I've been happy with. However, after looking at very similar roles I'm seeing salaries of $120k - $135k. I don't want to leave the company I work, it's a great place to work, and the benefits are excellent. What's making me look around is simply my salary which I believe may be a bit low considering my experience.
 The company I work for has a process for adjusting salaries based on the job market. I'm not sure how to approach my boss and do this dance. A raise of 20% would put me more in line with what I'm seeing from other job listings. I'm thinking I'll need to bring in evidence to justify the pay raise but I'm not sure what sources would be best to use. Should I even bring a copy of the other job listing that shows the higher pay or would this be a mad move? I could wait to have a more concrete offer but I know that once that card is played you have to be prepared to leave if a counter offer doesn't occur.
 Thank you

 We have had remote users lose network connectivity or lose audio and microphone functionality due to unexpected driver changes for the NICs and audio hardware.
 The fix has been to manually redeploy the working driver to their system. If it’s a network driver for a remote user and they can’t get back online, we have to ship them a replacement laptop and they lose days of work.
 Is there a setting to restrict drivers to the versions were have tested and are deploying?

 Background: I have to create a solution for auto certificate enrollment for IoT drives based on a locked version OpenSSL by the vendor. We are their first customer requesting 802.1x for nac port security but don't have a preference on how to automate the enrollment /renewal of certificates. Right now it's a very manual process. We use our own internal CA for laptops/desktops with GPO and AirWatch for company iPhones (6000+). Renewal period maybe 1year,2year or 5 year depending on the intermediate Issuing CA. 
 Does any one have any experience with this? I would also use this we future developments and axis cameras. There would be over 1000 devices to start and would increase over time so must be scalable. 
 Looking for some Pointers, would keyscaler solve this problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Curious to know what tools you're all using for network configuration management in automation. 
 The network I manage is not well connected (mobile units) and as such, many devices can be expected to be offline at one time. I've thought about using Ansible for pushing configuration changes, but given the high probability that a node is offline, I would have to develop intelligence that pushes until successful over an interval. This could get a little finicky. 
 I'm thinking of testing out a pull-based automation platform, but I don't have any experience with them whatsoever. My Ansible experience is limited to laboratory environments. I've used Nornir to backup devices, but again, hit or miss depending on what's online. I schedule this to occur once nightly at a time where I should have a decent success ratio. What would be easier? Having the configurations managed from a central automation platform and having the devices pull that down. 
 I don't yet have a Single Source of Truth developed, but I am working on this. I came into the organization with phpIPAM as our IPAM tool. It doesn't do DCIM very well whatsoever, so I'm wanting to move to something else (Infoblox, Bluecat, or NetBox if they'll let me go FOSS again). Meanwhile, I'm shopping automation platforms.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks,
 I don't know if it's okay to ask this in this subreddit, but since I got a lot of information regarding testing new hard drives from here, I thought I give it a shot.
 I recently purchased two Seagate Expansion Desktops (16 TB each, the one I started testing with is a ST16000NM000J model) and did a little research to check if and how I should test my new storage devices, since I'm new to this whole topic (Windows 10).
 Here is what I came up with: https://pastebin.com/HHXPsEmu 
 If somebody wants to read and / or correct me - be my guest.
 Following my research, I wanted to do a Erase Test with HDDScan on the new drive as a first step, but it immediately started listing bad blocks and doesn't stop to list them (SMART values were all okay) . Now I read on several links (Link1, Link2, Link3), that this probably is a failure of HDDScan. I tried 3 or 4 times, always starting HDDScan as admin, re-assigning the drive since it won't get detected anymore after canceling the Erase Test, turned it on and off again, turned PC on and off again, nothing seems to work. 
 Is my drive just flatout broken, does HDDScan just don't work correctly (what am I doing wrong?), is there a fix to this or what is the problem? 
 Is there any other way of doing a destructive read / write test on Windows to verify my drive, that this community recommends? I heard about badblocks, but I'm not in the mood to set up a Linux virtual machine just for this and I don't want to upgrade to a Windows 11 Developer Build just to get a functioning mount-command for WSL.
 I didn't test it with the other redundancy drive yet, but since this seems to be an error (or at least it seems to me), I did what any regular human being would do - frantically ask some dudes on reddit. I will test the other drive the following days and can update this thread, if necessary. Any help is appreciated <3

 In the cisco corner we have a 3750 with 3 vlans (1,2,20) and in the D-Link corner we have a 1510 with the same vlans configured. Should be simple to connect them, trunk port with 2,20 on the trunk and 1 as native, then on the D-Link side a hybrid port with 1 native untagged and 2 and 20 tagged.
 Nope only vlan that passes traffic is 1 (native), so we abandon that idea and setup an access port for 2 and another for 20,sfill no dice. Only mac address learnt was the port on the dlink.
 Checked the config on the dlink in cli, nothing odd at all really quite basic. Even withy everything broken out into access ports vlan 1 was the only one that passed traffic.
 So, any ideas on this one, as I'm at a bit of a loss how something that should have been simple just failed to work as expected.
 Cheers.

 https://delinea.com/resources/password-strength-checker 36 quadrillion years 
  https://password.kaspersky.com/ 4 months 
  https://bitwarden.com/password-strength/ 1 day 
 
 As you can see the results are all over the place!

 PS: Dont worry, Aband0nedFairgr0und is not a password I use and was made up as a test.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have a good sized DMVPN environment with approximately 100 spokes. One of these locations, happens to be my office.
 My office in this case, has 5 x WAN links, all of which today are VDSL-class 100Mbps lines.
 My ISR's here, are 2951 HSEC+ K9 with the ISM accelerator.
 Performance is satisfactory for 100Mbps circuits, however there are some issues:
  
I am replacing the VDSL links with 3 x Fiber links, each of which is 1Gbps down, 100Mbps up.
 The machines are getting old, and my facility is the only one that must have aes256 tunnels, hence IOS 'up2date' is very important here, the 2951 is now eol.
 If I can cut down on physical equipment I will be happy
  
Downstream of the ISR's (dmvpn spokes) I use ASA5585-X's with WAN traffic zones for load balancing. Each ISR has it's own transit network with it's own /29, and therefore the ASA sees each ISR's downlink as a separate WAN
 All of this today, works very well, I could say that I'm very satisfied.
 However, with the new year coming, I need to make changes to match the new WAN links that are inbound.
 So, my question:
 Is it possible for me to purchase say a modern ASR, link 4, 5, say 6 WAN links to it directly (route to internet direct), and then with that single ASR, join my DMVPN cloud?
 Consider that the single ASR, will have a single serial number, hence a single certificate, and I'm trying to join DMVPN with a single ASR as "multiple spokes"
 The reason for this is that each WAN link needs to be encrypted by way of dmvpn, such that the transit downlink to the ASA is encrypted. The ASA knows only that he sees 4-5 WAN links, which are ultimately DMVPN spokes
 Thank you for any feedback

 So myself and, the Intune guy ( we are both new at a Company of around 2,000 users )We need to enable secure boot; not done at setup, but we have bios passwords, all different based on a company asset sticker.
 Yes, they do a few things backwards; I'm working on it :)
 I found some manufacturer Bios passwords, I wondered if anyone knows a lenovo one.I've tried these so far.
 https://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000451.htm 
 My goal is to use the Lenovo, wmi commands to edit the setting, but you need to pass the bios password from there documentation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have run into an install error that I have never encountered before and cannot figure out how to solve. Attempting to Google this is absolutely mind melting. I can only hope someone here is able to help solve is. 
 I have a company computer that I am not an admin on, nor do I manage the AD domain or policies. I do, however, access to the local admin account. I have one application only that is not installing properly and installs without issue on non domain computers.
 The error I receive is,
 "This application requires a minimum of Internet Explorer 3.0 for this Operating System before installation. Please install minimum requirements and restart.
 The install will now abort."
 The machine I am on has IE 11, Edge, Chrome, and Opera GX. All of them are up to date and operational. Running as admin, disabling, re-enabling IE, booting to safe mode and forcing the installer, direct login as local admin, most everything you can think of does not solve this issue. 
 At this point I'm at a complete loss and don't even know what else I can check. I'm not even sure what group policy could be effecting this. The local admin account is also part of the Administrators group. Any help is more than greatly appreciated.

 Started as a PC tech and moved up to Sr Admin. It's public sector so the pay isn't great. I'm 60% remote with a 2hr round trip the other days.
 I love the work and the people but I'm at the ceiling, I'm at the last rung of the ladder unless my boss meets a meteor.
 And being local govt things don't change so I'd be looking at the same thing for the next 3-4 years.
 Got called back about a position 15min away. Private sector hospice center. In office for a month then 40% remote. It's not a Sr Admin but would be an increase putting me above what my current director is making.
 My main concerns are:
 They are VMware shop, my experience is with Xen/XCP, Proxmox and Nutanix.
 They are a Cisco shop, my experience is with Avaya/Extreme.
 But they looked at my resume and wanted to schedule an interview ASAP. Fingers crossed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, looking for some help here and can't seem to find the right words to Google it.
 I just finished a web application that requires Google chrome and a specific extension to run. The point of this application is for customers to schedule their own appointments in our system. Boss wants to have a PC set up on location for the customers to utilize this app, so I need to get this PC (that is running normal Win11 Home) locked down.
 What I mean by locked down:
  
The PC should only allow chome to be opened in full screen, and only the application's url allowed. (All other web traffic should be blocked)
 
Users should be unable to launch any other programs (i.e. file explorer, cmd, start menu etc.). Ideally, they wouldn't even be allowed to exit chrome's full screen mode or get back to the desktop
 
Disabling keyboard shortcuts (Win+R, Alt+Tab, Ctrl+Alt+Delete, etc.) 
 
 I'm sure this is a pretty common use case for PC's, so the answer has to exist, but I can't seem to find the right words to Google to start figuring out how to set it up. Just a bunch of chrome troubleshooting. Appreciate any advice or references to articles that would give me a push in the right direction.
 Edit 1: Thank you everyone for reminding me that "Kiosk" is a word. That's definitely what I'm looking for. The limitations by not allowing extensions is bothersome, but I might be able to reconfigure the app for Firefox.

If it is, why wouldn't setting active/passive be the norm?

 Our core switch in our office is an Aruba 2930F. The access switches connected to it are all ruckus ICX 7150s. I am trying to add a tagged VLAN to one of the access switches. The core switch is running MSTP.
 I can tag the upstream port on the core switch for the relevant VLAN, but as soon as I tag the downstream port on the access switch, I lose connection to it and the core switch logs show that the port has been blocked by STP. 
 I have tried this twice for two different access switches, with two different VLANs, neither of which appear to be in a loop, as they are only conn…]]></summary>

 In a hybrid cloud environment where you have your dedicated connection between the public cloud and on-premises (AWS DirectConnect, Azure ExpressRoute, Oracle FastConnect etc.) and:
  
The dedicated connection is provided by a third party service provider (not listed in the direct partner listing for the cloud provider)
 MACsec is NOT supported on your CPE
 You have to comply PCI-DSS, and you have your non-CDE communicating with your CDE over the dedicated connection
  
Do you encrypt the dedicated connection with IPsec? As in, is it normally required by PCI-DSS auditors in this case?
 P.s. Before anyone asks, no, I do not have contact with the auditors so I can't ask them directly - they will be contracted by my client but that would be a few more months.

Since a domain-joined device places 'Domain Users' in the local USERS group by default, is there any reason for having the device's primary user's domain account in the local USERS group as well? 
 For example, Sally works for Contoso and is provided a domain-joined Windows 10 laptop named SALLYLAPTOP and account named 'sally@contoso.com'. SALLYLAPTOP's local USERS group has the domain group "Domain Users" in it. Does Sally's individual domain account also need to be in the local USERS group of SALLYLAPTOP? 
 If the answer is NO, and adding the specific user account is just redundant, why do you think so many machines have the user's domain account in their local USERS group? Is Windows doing this by default? If a domain user signs into a domain-joined laptop for the first time, does Windows automatically add the user's domain account to USERS? And is it worth my effort cleaning up all those local USERS groups, removing those individual accounts?

I followed the procedure from EVE-NG, everything is ok but when I start client (Windows on QEMU), it is too slow. I can use various ISO ( Win7 /10) the result is always the same. I can install Windows but then it is stuck on "Windows is starting..."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been having some issues with our sip service over the past few weeks. Occasionally we are not able to dial out. We never have issues with inbound calls. After some additional troubleshooting I found that we were not able to dial out after our sip trunks were idle for some period of time, an inbound call would "fix" the problem and allow us to dial out. 
 I ran a packet capture on a L2 switch in between the SIP trunk provider's SBC & the ISP's router - we see the SIP Invite packets leaving their device but never get a response.
 The SIP Trunk provider states that the issue is they are not receiving those packets. It's about a dozen packets sent to 3 or 4 different WAN addresses. They're stating the the ISP isn't delivering them. 
 I want to call BS on the SIP trunk provider as we've had zero issues with our ISP otherwise. I reached out to the carrier anyways to see if it'd be possible for them to "prove" they are delivering the packets per the sip trunk provider's request. This request seems to be confusing them. 
 Normally I have the ability to just do things myself and figure out who's to blame but this is a new one for me. I tried switching our SIP Trunks over to our backup internet (different ISP) and wasn't able to reproduce the issue but it wasn't a long enough test window that I can say with confidence the issue doesn't occur. 
 Any recommendations on how to proceed?

 With so many damn ways to communicate anymore, how are sysadmins handle all the platforms people are using? At this point I have internal and external colleagues on Teams, Zoom, Slack, Meet, Reddit, and Discord. I tend not to be very active on them half because of them being scattered. 
 Back in the days of IRC there used to be clients to merge all the platforms into one app. Does anything like that exist anymore? RSS feeds? A digest app? A dozen monitors? How do you guys manage it?
 Edit: I'm going to add a little extra context. Our org has "standardized" on four platforms: Teams, Zoom, WebEx, and Slack. Which platform meetings are held depends on the department we're dealing with and how inflexible they are. I try to force all communication through Teams, but it's hit or miss.
 Vendors and other external orgs (e.g ACM slacks) I deal with tend to use Meet, Zoom and Teams. Again, I try to funnel through Teams but our org doesn't do guest accounts and some vendors are stubborn.
 Reddit and Discord is mostly me trying to stay up to date with tech news.

 I'll try and make this a clear without diagrams as possible.
 Currently labbing L3 down to the access layer utilizing OSPF in area 0. Everythings working with each access switch having two equal paths up to the internet. Happy days.
 I've had a play around disabling one of the links on the uplink switch so that only one link is now active. When running a constant ping from a pc on the access switch to 8.8.8.8 I get a loss of 3-4 packets. My understanding was that if both equal paths are in the routing table then theres no convergence and there should no loss.
 I've configured BFD which hasnt resolved. Could this be due to meusing ICMP and EVE NG as a test? Or something along the lines on the routing table not refreshing quick enough?
 I'd like to know your thoughts as this wouldn't be a good scenario within a datacentre

I'm kind of inheriting a mess and down for making it work. Smaller business, 100 employees. 30k Sq Ft office. Nothing tracked but machines, not even 100%.
 We outsource our helpdesk for now. So I'm looking at asset labels, but until I get that approved I'm just using a label maker. 
 We have several nicer label makers I want to see if I can make work. I still think the laptops needs legit metal tags for durability but in office monitors etc are fine for labels.
 Label makers we have: Zebra ZP 505 Zebra QLn420 Dymo 450 turbo Dymo Letra Tag Brother PT-D400
 Are any of these viable asset tag creaters that would make me not need to order metal/vnyl tags from asset tag.
 As far as asset tracking, I figured these categories were appropriate, pretty much anything over $50 in value. 
 Laptops Desktops Monitors Docking Stations Keyboard Mouse Combo (standard new hire) Keyboards (some are $250) Mouse (some are $100 ) Monitor Mounts? Every person has 2 arms and 2 monitors UPS Units ( So I can track and perform maintenance ) TVs in meeting rooms
 Consumables I understand are toner, office supplies etc.
 So, any of our current label makers be able to be sufficient in a decent quality tag? 
 I'd love to have it say 
 Property Owned by: Name/logo Company 
  123456
 But I need it pretty small. 
 And do those categories look pretty standard. Should I break it down by Individual office desk or just the general office. ( we have 2 suites ) 
 Thanks yall, I didn't see a better sub for this. 
 Also not many great videos on snipe it. I may have to make some.

 Our intention is to put a NAS (10GbE) and specific clients (10GbE) on VLAN50, all connected to the Switch 1. I just want to make sure, if we copy files between VLAN50 clients which are all on the same subnet and connected to the Switch 1, will traffic stay with the switch or also pass through the router and bottleneck the 10GbE requirement?
 If traffic does stay with the switch, would you still recommend us offloading the inter-VLAN routing by letting the Switch 1 be the gateway for VLAN50 instead of the router?

 I have a client that was recently infected with ransomware and all their files were encrypted. The worst of it was their MSSQL database with all the data they need to run their business without having to restart from the ground up. Due to not following best practices (Not my fault, I work for the software development company that developed the software that uses the database, not their IT provider) they were hit with the ransomeware. They paid the ransome, got the key and had some other company decrypt the data. 
 We got the unencrypted database MDF and backup files. I'm pretty sure the data is still there but the headers are gone so we are unable to attach or restore the files. I'm not the most savy with SQL so I thought I'd probe the mindhive. 
 Has anyone else had any success recovering SQL databses corrupted by ransomeware? TIA

 The uplink ports of the layer 2 switches are connected to the VRRP routers.
 Multiple layer 2 switches will be connected to the VRRP routers. Normally I would put each layer 2 switch in a separate VLAN, but with VRRP this has the downside of wasting a large proportion of public IPv4 addresses in each subnet. Most switches have 24 or 48 port which do not align with subnet sizes.
 IP unnumbered would appear to be a solution to efficient use of IPv4 space, but I can find very little documentation about its use with VRRP. Well, other than information from Arista that it isn't supported:
 https://aristanetworks.force.com/AristaCommunity/s/question/0D52I00007EzQehSAF/unnumbered-ip-interfaces-and-virtual-router
 Does anybody know if other vendors, such as Cisco or Juniper, support VRRP with IP unnumbered?
 Huawei has a concept called super-VLAN, which is similar to IP unnumbered and it supports VRRP. Is this my only choice, other than trusting port isolation and proxy arp or wasting a large percentage of my IPv4 space with subnets and VRRP?

 I can create an Outlook Rule that uses the "Redirect" message and that will bypass the transport rule block.
 I implemented the Remote Domain method . It did not block emails if the user set up Redirect to in Outlook.

 ​
 - Event ID 4624 (successful login)
 - Event ID 4627 (group membership info)
 - Event ID 4634 (log off).
 ​
 So far so good I didn't really care about this, since I noticed some that some PCs are connecting way more then others.
 ​
 Like my PC generates 6 events/h and another generated something like 540 events/h. WHY ?
 The PCs are the same, they both are already done with their encryptions, and they show no errors in the MBAM reports.

 Any ideas...?

 I am the only IT member in the company for about 40 people in the HQ office. Is there some type of monitoring software or hardware that would give me the ability to see what is being downloaded, anytime an external hard drive is plugged into the machines, and things of that nature. We use laptops not desk tops and dont know if its even possible to do this type of monitoring with laptops. Does Azure have this form of monitoring?

 Hey I am currently developing a Shopify store and have found the offers in the app store lacking. 
 Im looking for a warehouse management system that can properly track all of my inventory, meaning that it can tell me where Product A is, e.g Product A is on shelf A.
 Concurrently it should also include an order processing system, which will compile a packing list of all the orders that have been paid for.
 Our old system has these features and it would be nice if there was an App that could do the same.
 I have found a couple companies that provide this externally from shopify, although i am not sure how trustworth they are (sksuvault, skusaavy) They seem to have everything I need, but they are very low key and I cannot find enough data supporting them to be reliable. I am willing to consider external apps that can be integrated into shopify aswell as shopify apps themselves.

 Elon Musk’s orders were clear: Close the data center.
 Early on Christmas Eve, members of the billionaire’s staff flew to Sacramento — the site of one of Twitter’s three main computing storage facilities — to disconnect servers that had kept the social network running smoothly. Some employees were worried that losing those servers could cause problems, but saving money was the priority, according to two people who were familiar with the move but not authorized to talk about it.
 The data center shutdown was one of many drastic steps Mr. Musk has undertaken to stabilize Twitter’s finances. Over the past few weeks, Twitter had stopped paying millions of dollars in rent and services, and Mr. Musk had told his subordinates to renegotiate those agreements or simply end them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So up until recently I worked for one of Fortinet’s competitors, and the general consensus (from our competitive intelligence team) was that Fortinet SD-WAN wasn’t truly up to snuff for a few reasons:
 (1) Supposedly, using ASICs in their hardware (as opposed to general x86 CPUs) means that customers have to rip and replace their appliances to get new functionality… I find this hard to believe, as aren’t their ASICS actually FPGA’s/programmable?
 (2) Lack of a “true” overlay… only VPNs with basic IP SLA’s attached. However… based on what research I’ve done, I don’t really see anything lacking in this area?
 (3) They require switches to sit in front of the appliances for HA… however, I understand that the newer branch models have built-in switches. Is this no longer a requirement?
 What’s your opinion? Was I fed lies / information that was no longer accurate? What’s the consensus on Fortinet SD-WAN?

 One he’s at a country I’ve blocked being able to connect to my VPN so made exception for him. Ticket had CEO CC’d who he is BFF with and had high urgency. 
 Replied to try again and he replied doesn’t work. I ask if I can remote into his machine and he says okay. I use ConnectWise and I’m in. Before I can even start investigating I get disconnected. 
 Try to reconnect and no go. Call him and no answer. I use CW on my office workstation and works fine. Email him to call me back. 
 4 hours later get email VPN still down. He finally calls me from a weird number and goes yeah I still can’t connect. I told him I was disconnected and he’s like yeah I closed the laptop lid to conserve battery. I’m like I called you why didn’t you answer. Oh yeah I jumped in the pool with my phone… I need a new phone. Then he goes don’t worry you can fix issue after New Year. I go you got my email on your phone right? And tell him you don’t need VPN to check email and if you get email on your phone why did you need your laptop. He just says Merry Christmas even tho we’re past it and hangs up. LOL
 Normally I’d be annoyed but it’s slow and my projects are done for year and I’m just studying for my next cert so this was a entertaining distraction of sorts.

The assistant IT director insists this is a safer method than service accounts, but I'm not sure if I agree. My concern is if DHCP reassigns a previously allow-listed address, it would potentially be possible for that device to spoof emails, or at least send emails using whatever domain address they want unauthenticated.
 What are your thoughts? Should I address this with our IT director?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve got a bit of a strange problem with a Dell R520 that presented a no boot device error when rebooting for Windows updates. 
 IDrac shows no hw issues, perc h710 mini shows good health and ran a consistency check with no issues. Virtual disk is selected as boot volume. Single VD, 3-disk raid5. 
 In the bios settings the boot is correctly set to uefi but no bootable devices are detected. 
 If I boot off an iso into Windows recovery I can clearly see the Windows partitions including the efi part and all the files. I also attempted to rebuild the eco boot record from a Dell support article. 
 I’m suspecting a quirky hw failure of the raid card but wanted to check with the community to see if I’m missing anything. Its one of our physical DCs and is redundant so it’s not hurting us, but if I can I would like to repair so I don’t have to do a rebuild.

 With the move to laptops from desktops. How are your workplaces handling the management of devices? Compared to an always on desktop getting security patches and software updates overnight versus laptops users and managers seem to tuck away and bring back online weeks or months later at time?

 I've dabbled with automation/python here and there, decided I want to really dig deep into automation for 2023 and move into a network automation role. The cisco devnet associate exam caught my eye and I'm really loving it so far...UNTIL it started to get really heavy into the cisco proprietary stuff (DNA,APIC,ACI,NX-OS,CISCO SD-WAN,ISE,UCM,FIREPOWER) UGHHH. I don't have real world experience with any of these products, I've always worked in a mixed vendor environment.
 Would it make sense career wise to just tough it out and learn this stuff with no experience ? or should I just learn all the popular automation frameworks/tools/CICD stuff - work on some projects then apply to jobs ?
 Would this cert give me any leverage vs other folks who apply for the same position ? I don't know what to do.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The IT manager title might be a bit generous, but I've been overseeing a three man IT team for a mid-sized nonprofit for the past 5 years, and have worked for the company for over 11 in total. My old boss and I built the department from the ground up when I first started there, and I stepped into his role when he left. Like with most small teams, my position wears a lot of hats from management/planning to hands-on sysadmin and tech work.
 Unlike when my old boss left, I don't think anyone internal is capable of filling the role, so while I'm sure the ship will be kept afloat for a while, they're eventually going to have to hire externally. I don't consider myself to be particularly hot shit, but unless they get lucky, they're going to have a hard time finding someone qualified to fill the role for what they're paying. I mostly stuck around as long as I did because of personal investment and the fact I was given freedom to operate and learn, which I value highly. I know their ability to replace me is ultimately not my problem, but I want to do what I feasibly can to make things easier on the guys under me when I leave, especially one who has a lot going on personally at the moment and is unlikely to be able to start job hunting any time soon if things go south.
 I'm giving a three-week notice after new year's. My current plan is to tidy up a couple of existing projects, make sure documentation is all shored up, help with hiring if HR miraculously gets candidates in time, and just generally be a resource until I leave. I might give my boss my contact information to potentially provide services at a contracted rate for emergencies as well, but I'm undecided on that.
 Is there anything else you guys would do specifically in my situation to help ease the turnover for your team?

 1 extra second X minimum 2 times per day X 200 working days per year = 400 seconds (6.6 minutes) X 10,000 employees at a large company = 66,000 minutes (1100 hours, or 46 days = 137 standard 8 hour working days) of employees dismissing the corporate warning message.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After all that flooding in the MDF a few days ago, I've begun planning the hardware replacements. 
 Currently we're all in on Aruba/HP switches, with the occasional Netgear. They work great and I like them (besides the netgears). 
 We had new single mode fiber installed in 2015 and its never been used. We're still on the gigabit multimode stuff. 
 I figured its time to go 10g, we have 240+ 4k IP cams everywhere and they network is pretty much idling at 90% of 1gbps. I've had to start lowering bitrates on cams.
 The firewall is currently an aging SonicWall NSA2600, which I hate. Considering going Fortigate.
 The question is, Should I go Fortiswitch, or stay Aruba? We have about 40 switches. I hear full stack Fortinet is a magical thing.
 Currently the Arubas are managed by CLI/NetDisco. Its great, but NetDisco cant do much beyond identifying devices, and setting the untagged vlan - and I need to break out putty for anything else.
 Also need a Wi-Fi solution, FortiAP? Currently have Ruckus managed by the ISP, but we hate the ISP to the point where we're suing them and will be kicking them out next year. They'll probably take their R710s with them. We'd need about 500 WAPs with PPSK that can guarantee about 300mbps across 900 relatively modern devices.

 We've run into a major production issue with our pair of Dell 4032 switches - they are used as iSCSI for 3 esxi hosts and distribution for other devices. Issue is: out of the blue we lost access to several VMs. 
 Rebooting one of the two restored access, however, the issue keeps coming back and the only fix is a reload. We replaced one of the switches but the problem remains - after 1 day (at most) we lose access to critical VMs and until we reboot the device. There's nothing relevant in the logs (I'll attach the spanning-tree detail and running config). There were no changes made to the environment or configs. besides setting the root bridge ID to a lower value on one of the two (from the default 32768).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there any living person on this Earth that actually disabled NTLM in his environment?
 Not in a lab or something like that, but with real working functioning production services.
 Because, you know, there is a lot of cybersecurity fuss about switching from NTLM to Kerberos and real vulnerabilities.
 I know that for Kerberos you need to be in contact with DC to acquire tickets or use something like KDC proxy and it is not always feasible.
 I know how to audit for NTLM usage on servers or on DC.
 But the question stands: Has anyone actually did disable NTLM in his production environment? How did it go? What’s the caveats?
 I’m thinking that it is possible to disable incoming NTLM authentication traffic only on some of the servers and audit helps here.
 But the main target here is DCs. So, how about disabling incoming NTLM auth only on DCs? And I haven’t seen any success stories on this matter anywhere.
 I’m asking this question in r/sysadmin specifically, because I don’t need any more guides on how to do it, but actually I need some information from people that actually did it and do support these environments afterwards.
 UPD: I'm not talking about disabling NTLMv1 and just forcing NTLMv2. I'm talking about complete disablement of incoming NTLM auth. This GPO for example: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/network-security-restrict-ntlm-incoming-ntlm-traffic

 What's the deal? Are they cloud managed like Meraki? Are there limitations for end devices? I'm not looking for a full conversion over to them but they are priced cheaper and in stock... Don't want a device that doesn't mesh well with what I've got.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone else experienced this? I feel like every job I've had I constantly have people adamantly tell me things as golden truths that turn out to be flat wrong. Then I have to work backwards to find why they think something, how it actually works, and get the information correctly, then inform them that they are actually wrong. It's usually just "oh okay, thought you meant something else". 
 I just don't understand it. I'll gladly be the idiot constantly saying I don't exactly know, but I have an idea let me get back to you in a bit. Some people just hammer down concrete facts (to them) even though they are blatantly wrong, and it leads to so much extra wasted time to unravel what's actually going on. There have been times when I straight up trusted coworkers and did something exactly as they or their documentation said and its still wrong lol

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We had a new user that got locked out of her account three days in a row. We'd remotely unlock and provide a temporary password, with a forced reset at first login, and she'd be good to go, but the next day it would be the same silliness again.
 After a few days of this silliness, I walked to her desk and watched her log in. No issues.
 The next day, she couldn't log in again. I walk over, and she tries again, and no issues. She has no idea what's happening and suspects we're messing with her. I assure her that we're not.
 The next day, inevitably, she can't log in again. So I walk over and watch her log in. When she's in, I make her log out and back again. And again. After the third attempt, she's convinced everything is good, so I walk back to my desk, and she's right back there saying it stopped working again. 
 I was irritated by this time, and I asked her to describe exactly what she did after I left.
 "Nothing, I swear! My login only works while you're here!"
 Back at her desk, I watched her type in her password more closely and facepalmed. 
 When we gave her a random password or while I was at her desk, she would look down at her keyboard as she typed, and it worked. But all the other times, she would touch-type her password and instinctively add a space at the end.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our company has both internal and external IT support to tackle all of the tasks required from a medium / large organization. A year ago we hired an MSP to help be our "virtual CTO" and were woo'd with promises of stability, future infrastructure projections and 24/7 on-call support.
 All was well for the first six months, but now we are over a year into the relationship and the veil has been lifted. We no longer get the quarterly check-in's with fancy charts and future mapping, the MSP IT team really only have one or two specialists that can work on network issues and complex SQL problems, and worse yet, their "projects" team is a place where tickets and requests go to die unless we babysit the progress.
 We are looking to move to a new MSP that we believe will be able to meet the demands of our company, but until then we are still semi-reliant on our current MSP to handle routine tasks, be on call, etc.I am working to get their knowledgebase of our company extracted for internal documentation in hopes that we can make a smoother transition to a new MSP at a later date. 
 I just want to know what your experience has been with difficult MSP partners, and how to handle them?

 He needs a script that downloads a specific language and sets it as default, configure locale and regional settings. We checked for those things online, and found some long scripts in powershell to configure regional settings and locale (locale is easy), which don't appeal him. I'm just wondering, is there an option to switch regional settings with a single cmdlet or maybe do it programmaticaly in C#? And to download a language package, install it and set it as default?

 I have just few users on E5 and some on E3.
 How does the Defender for office 365 work currently? Does it need only one user licensed or each one needs to be licensed additionally?
 The users with E3 only will not benefit with Defender for Office 365 at all in this case? So no additional scanning of attachments, safe links options and so on?

Ever since we enabled Hybrid AD join in our organisation (or at least I think that is the issue, since I noticed they were gone around that time), most of the users’ machines disappeared from the devices tab under each user. Like we can see their phones for example, but the computer just isn’t there. It’s not a big deal but sometimes it’s the quickest way to find out someone’s machine and I’d like to bring it back for the sake of my own convenience. 
 What I noticed so far is that my own machine, that is not available to look up in my user devices page, its Join Type is Hybrid Azure AD Joined; MDM: None Then I looked up my boss machine, that one is actually available under his Devices tab and what differs is his machine’s Join Type is Azure AD registered, MDM also says none. 
 Could you guys help me fix this and bring all the users devices available under their respective Devices tab. Let me know if any logs/screenshots/etc is needed

 User contacts helpdesk. Helpdesk tech joins a teams meeting. Install. Admin Credential Prompt. Login by tech. Proceed. Next install. Repeat.
 Except at some point, user opens a command prompt for one of the installs and doesn't close it, just minimizes. Session ends.
 User now has an admin command prompt. lusrmgr.msc and they can grant local admin rights to themselves. Undoes everything regarding restrictions on local installs.
 Is this just failure by the user for obviously trying to slip by processes? Or failure of the tech to make sure they watched what they signed in for? Or failure of some larger approach that makes something like this impossible?
 What would you put in place to make it so that a user with an admin command prompt couldn't grant local admin rights? Or is this basically past the point of no return and the only thing you can do is make sure the tech watches what they login for?
 Granted. User's actions are trying to bypass the rules. I'm more curious what can stop this beyond better trained helpdesk tech's.

 I'm trying to setup a fortigate box with 4 VDOMs where each VDOM needs to access the internet with it's own IP address.
 I've used a Fortinet guide to setup the VDOMs and have the root do the WAN stuff so each VDOM only knows about it's own network and forward the rest to the root.
 Everything works but I can't figure out how to use a different IP for each VDOM's WAN.
 I have a /29 subnet so I have enough IPs but I can't find a way to set a different IP since my WAN port has a way to only set one IP for it.
 Any help is blessed!
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been thinking about a long held tenet of IT administration in the context administrative accounts.
 It’s good practice to have administrative accounts separate to day to day accounts, and only to use them for administrative tasks, but as an extension of that I wanted to find out if anyone had gone even further than segregation of activity by account and actually denied local logon in a windows centric network to admin accounts for administrative functions, relying solely on elevation where required.
 This would include servers and clients; currently my team and myself, login using our admin account to perform admin functions, I’m thinking of changing our governance on that to enforce login using standard accounts with elevation using admin credentials within the standard login required for changes.
 My thinking is that this will reduce the opportunities for misconfiguration by imposing an administrative control whilst simultaneously reducing admin account chatter in our siem logs for more focused reporting and alerting on admin activities.
 Interested in what the community thinks or does already.
 Cheers

 It's Friday December 30th, and you're wrapping up for the day in anticipation for the New Year's holiday weekend. You've got outstanding infrastructure changes to commit but can't decide if they should be postponed until the next business day, so you think "fuck it" and slap Enter. The loading bar crawls to completion and the rest is history.
 A day has passed and all seems fine. You're headed to your parent's place to kickstart the holidays and as far as you're concerned, the back-end changes were steadily applied the day prior.
 Your automated IT monitoring solution alerts you about a vague error, but you've just arrived at Ma's house so you figure you'll deal with it later. Before you can stuff your mouth full of spanakopita, your phone's ringing off the hook: it's your <insert scary C-Suite executive here>, screeching at the top of their lungs about a critical revenue-impacting service being down.
 You know how this goes. 
 You've abandoned your poor partner with woke Uncle Ross spouting mercury in microwave theories at the dinner table, while you troubleshoot issues from your parent's dialup internet in your childhood bedroom. The stuffed animals judging you from afar because you couldn't save yourself the heartache by implementing a change management freeze 'till 2023.
 For the sake of your vacation, your peers, your family, your partner, and your sanity, don't hit Enter.
 Happy Holidays and Happy New Year to all, and thank you for keeping this sub dope. <3

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Murphy's law got me... I was doing some maintenance before a holiday, and one of the steps was rebooting my core switch, an Aruba CX 6405.
 I rebooted it remotely of course, and noticed it was taking a VERY LONG time for the network to come back online. So I go to the datacenter and see an angry red fault light blinking, along with slot 3 blinking red. The card that has failed is a 48-port smart rate poe card with 4 50g sfp56 ports, part number R0X41A.
 In the logs, I found this information:  Message Event|3207|LOG_ERR|AMM|1/1|Line module 1/3 has failed: Internal error Severity Critical (Priority: 3) Syslog ID hpe-cardd Source Time 12/28/22 21:44:38 (1672281878338489) Sequence # 630,332,193 
 My Google skills are failing me here... I find that event 3207 mentioned in a few documents, but they don't give any troubleshooting steps. I have opened a ticket with ASP, but they can't even tell me when an engineer will call at this point.
 Any ideas what I can do to troubleshoot? Here's what I've tried so far:
  
Reboot again, crossing fingers and toes
 Reseat the card in its slot
 Upgrade to the latest firmware published at ASP
 Allowed the switch to perform an "unsafe update" on non-redundant modules (it asked to do this)

 I ask because we are a Cisco Shop. But most of our team in the last few years has retired. We have a 50/50 split and I've been tasked with looking at alternatives for our refresh. We are looking to replace all of our switches to Cisco 9K with ISE (We have), DNA(We have) and NetBox. We're going to be running an "SDN Fabric" for our refresh. 
 I'm looking at Juniper and Arista right now. I really don't care what we run. I really just want the best thing possible WITHOUT being overly complicated.

 And it accepts it but says "This exclusion is not recommended". Really? Where how else am I suppose to stop you deleting 7-Zip file manager.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[3D-secure visa payment in now compulsory in Europe. Wasabi does not support 3d-secure payment with visa cards, meaning European companies are left without practical ways to pay. Therefore Wasabi first asks to disable 3D-secure (which is not possible), then shut off these customers.
 That's an absurd way to lose customers, pushing them to other service providers. Fine for me, good alternatives exist.
 From the customer support :
 Hi xxx,
 I did just take a look at the conversation that you had with my Colleague XXXXXX, all of this was correct. At this time, the Wasabi Console does not have support for Credit Cards the require use of 3D-secure/OTP type authentication. If you do not have another type of card, your account will eventually be deleted form the system due to payment issues.

 Scenario: 
 I host a client's (C1) server in my datacenter. C1 is working with a vendor (V1) to have (site to site) VPN connectivity for V1's services. 
 V1 provides their peer gateway - I already have this peer configured for a tunnel for another client (C2). 
 V1 refuses to modify VPN to include C1 (already containing C2) (security policy), they won't provide any other peer, I don't have an additional peer to provide. C1 has already paid for V1's services, signed contract, etc. 
 I know this is a very dumbed-down scenario, but I have no clue how to even start tackling this. I don't have any access to C1's network. I do have a VPN set up from my datacenter to C1. 
 Could I get some assistance, something pointing me in at least a "starter" direction?

 Twice now accounting has missed bills and had our service shut off. However since all the users know that I touch all the phones they come to me. So its been fun seeing 85 percent of our phones suspended this morning. 
 Any idea about the best way to handle this? It's easy for the users to blame IT cause they don't have a full grasp of what we do. But Acct should really be in the hot seat imo.

 The project was to encompass a few areas. Not only did the company need a new phone system, but after my newbie eyes had looked at their network, I insisted that they redesign it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has been my experience that without an IGMP Snooping Querier on the network, multicast traffic effectively flows like a network broadcast within a VLAN (broadcast domain) and will hit every attached node. 
 When you have an IGMP Snooping Querier (like a gateway that is configured to support it) then the IGMP messages flow correctly and IGMP Snooping on the switch-side, which is typically enabled by default, has something to work with and properly filters outbound ports that aren't joined to the IGMP group. 
 This is likely an over-engineering rabbit hole, but for networks that you don't expect to actually do multicast routing - do you still enable an IGMP Snooping Querier somewhere on the network? That way things like SSDP stay within their boundaries (239.255.255.250:1900)? Although thinking further, the other chatty protocol - mDNS/bonjour uses 224.0.0.251 which is link-local multicast and from my experience doesn't get "snooped". 
 From some PCAPs I did see that Meraki has the layer 2 switch Querier feature enabled by default.
 Just curious if this is something others think about enabling.

I would like to make a new "connection profile" I think where if i have users in a non-employee group, they get put into a different profile with a completely different IP pool so I can put an ACL on their subnet and control them. I don't know how to do that and I don't know if I am using the correct terms to google for instructions. Can anyone tell me if I am using the correct terms and if not, what would be the correct things to google?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m wondering if the following setup is even possible to deploy. If so, what would I need to accomplish it, and if not, what would be the best way to achieve similar results.
 I want to have two lines with two different ISPs, and a VPS with a BGP session. Then, I would make a GRE tunnel to the VPS through each line and bond the two tunnels. Finally, I would go out to the Internet through the VPS’s own connection and using an IP range from an AS of my own, announced with the VPS’s BGP session.
 The objectives to accomplish here are mainly three, from the most important to the least:
  
Using my ASN. ISPs where I live charge extremely high prices for a line that allows you to use BGP, so I can save a big chunk of money here.
 
Redundancy. There’s why I want two lines with two ISPs, instead of two lines with the same ISP or even a single line.
 
Increased throughput. That’s why I want to do bonding instead of load balancing.
 
 The real question is: what do I need in terms of hardware and software?

The gauge is way to small to be a pull wire and also appears to be way too small to be any type of ground wire. I've seen this type of wire used for signals before, but I can't imagine what it would be used for. Gallery Here (three images)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Folks, 
 We have an issue with outbound emails which are not being received by our customers from past two days. Well it was working before and showing in Proofpoint outbound logs but now it's not. 
 We are sending via zoho mail and using Proofpoint as outbound gateway . Zoho support says the emails are relayed to Proofpoint, so you need to check with them. 
 We have raised the issue with channel managers and are waiting for their support (very slow) to respond. Is there any suggestion or recommendation by community members to troubleshoot the issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have multiple DCs in different locations for our company. We have a primary Domain Controller. On every DC, we have a constant barrage of event ID 4412 in Event Viewer, saying there is a conflict between files and the losing one is sent to the ConflictAndDeleted folder. I can’t figure out why this is happening. Files replicate correctly, but any file in the sysvol directory is subject to this error and having the copy deleted. I used procmon to see what files were being accessed. Files are being accessed by DFS service. I think it causes the service to think there was a change, and the 4412 event happens. We had nearly 1,000,000 files taking up 120GB before we realized what was happening. The ConflictAndDeleted folder on every server is slowly filing up, ignoring the limit I put on each CAndD folder in ADSI.
 When the DFS Replication service is turned off, obviously nothing happens. But when it's turned on, files will disappear from the folder, only to come right back a second later. The folder will have 8 items in it, then 7, then 8, and all I'm doing is sitting there watching.
 I've spent days on this, trying every article I can find. We have CyberArk and Commvault on the DCs. It might be the archive bit being changed by Commvault, but it's happening dozens of times a second, with the same files, and only in the sysvol folder.
 Thoughts?
 ​
 Thank you all in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[so it seems like Microsoft is disabling the option to install Win 10\11 22h2 for dynamic disks.
 This was their answer as for why
 " Dynamic disks have been deprecated from Windows and we don't recommend using them anymore. Instead, we recommend using basic disks or using the newer Storage Spaces technology when you want to pool disks together into larger volumes. If you want to mirror the volume from which Windows boots, you might want to use a hardware RAID controller, such as the one included on many motherboards. "
 why, just why? despite the fact almost all of OEM images already burned w i t h l i c a n s e on a dynamic disk...
 "oh you want to get the latest build? either you remove all of your data and convert to basic or pay for a 3rd party software like aomei to convert for you." Sorry for the rant but this is just stupid

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[About 11 years ago was when I had my first desk job, having moved from being a field contractor for Dell to a nice office as a Network/Asset Admin.
 After a short contract, I was offered said position at a software company specializing in data analytics/scraping.
 My entire life, I thought that anyone who could code or script was already at the absolute top of the food chain. Had already been there, done that, been through hell desk, and data centers!
 Boy! That Network Administrator position turned into Senior Hand Holder of the Dev Department.
 I was wrong. Very wrong.
 For years after, I continued to think the same of my fellow various admin’s I worked with. Everyone must just be better than me, I don’t know anything.
 Soon, I will be 30. Young-ish I suppose. But I’ve at least learned that we each have our skills. Whether that’s more, or less… 
 Even if someone appears as a prodigy, you can teach them something, many something’s perhaps.
 What did you believe, and when did that change?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Problem: I have a bunch of users that work on desktops, but depending on the day, they log into different desktops (think lab users, secretaries etc).
 They want their user data synced between the desktops, and importantly also their bookmarks.
 For the user data I would use folder redirection, it seems the most straight forward as these desktops are always online and in the domain, they are never moved off the domain so folder redirection should work very well.
 But unless I am mistaking, this cannot sync bookmarks of chrome, firefox and edge, can it?
 For the bookmarks I have been looking at roaming profiles, but this seems to not be recommended anymore as it often creates problems. I have found scripts that would make roaming profiles work with chrome and firefox bookmarks though, so it seems like a viable option.
 Is user profile disks an option here? I know it's designed for RDS, which is not the use case here, but rather profiles on local desktops within the domains. We don't have an RDS farm and would prefer not to set one up if it's not needed (due to licensing etc).
 Assuming user profile disks is a good option here, would it be best to combine it with folder redirection for all the 'standard' files (as it would likely reduce the size of the disk) or is it better to go with just 1 solution to keep it simple?
 Perhaps FSLogix is a solution here as well? To be combined with folder redirection or on its own?
 Thanks in advance!

Our company employs around 70-80 employees who are using mobile devices for their everyday work. 35 of them are using Windows laptops, 4 are using MacBooks and the rest 30-40 Field Service Agents are using Android Smartphones. 
 During Covid, we changed our IT infrastructure to a cloud-based one with ZOHO. We migrated from our custom-made onsite apps made on Visual Basic to ZOHO's Creator Platform. So far, it has been 2 years and with many ups and downs, we have finally made it to a somewhat smooth transition. Now back to my main question. As many of our employees are sometimes working from home and sometimes from the office, it becomes tricky to manage our devices. This includes windows updates, monitoring for any malware, system monitoring, etc. Is there any cloud-based tool that can help us monitor our devices.
 About me: I do not have an IT background but have to some extent knowledge of how things work. ;)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 We’re in the market for a new NGFW for our office. Just over 10 users but we host a variety of applications on our server at the office. 
 We currently have a Sophos XG and it’s ok, but I’m beginning to hate Sophos. I don’t know why we went down that path, it’s GUI is clunky, it doesn’t have mDNS (we do a lot of audio visual so it’s handy to have) and today we had to reboot the damn thing because it simply just decided to stop working. 
 We currently have a proxy on our server to handle all the request to different applications from our single public IP. Would be good to move that to the device but not a biggie.
 Our internet speed is 500/500.
 Security is a big thing, I regularly see palo being recommended here, forti too.
 I personally see watchguard, palo and Cisco in the field.
 A apart of me doesn’t want to spend a bunch of money but I know if it’s spent in the right area, I won’t have to think about it again. 
 Saw a silver peak device not long ago but it looks like they only do SD-WAN and not actual firewalling? We’re an Aruba house in central so would tie in nicely.
 We also use the connect VPN from Sophos, it’s good but average too. So anything with a “good” VPN is preferred.
 Open to all thoughts, ask as many questions to help best understand our requirement.

They don't have a dedicated IT department and our manager wants us to export the mailbox from their environment and import it into ours, which is Exchange 2013 on-prem.
 Now this would be simple if the size was manageable but it's not and we're trying to avoid .pst corruption and not interested in using any 3rd party apps. I've searched the web, this sub and a few other forums and the consensus is to break the export down into smaller .pst files by either date or folders. Which seems fairly straight forward but I figure I'd ask the experts to see if that's it or if anyone has input on any other workable options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[from the dhcp rfc:
  
Note that, in some network architectures (e.g., internets with more than one IP subnet assigned to a physical network segment), it may be the case that the DHCP client should be assigned an address from a different subnet than the address recorded in 'giaddr'. Thus, DHCP does not require that the client be assigned as address from the subnet in 'giaddr'. A server is free to choose some other subnet, and it is beyond the scope of the DHCP specification to describe ways in which the assigned IP address might be chosen.
  
Imagine a relay receives a DHCPDISCOVER on interface eth0 with address 192.168.1.1, then it forwards it to the dhcp server at 192.168.0.1, now because it's not required to give an address on the 192.168.1.0 subnet, it gives an address on the 192.168.0.0 subnet, how is this acceptable?
 ​
 Then another host on the 0.0 subnet would arp for the client, but the client wouldnt receive the arp broadcast since they are not on the same physical subnet.

The DMZ switches have reached EOL, and our network is small enough to handle the extra traffic load put onto the Core switch. Now back when I took my CCNA, I got the impression that the DMZ switch was supposed to be a separate switch, but my coworker, who has way more experience than me, says that in his experience they're integrated into the core.
 That being said, I'm trying to wrap my head around how the integration would work. I am thinking it's a case of directing incoming traffic from the ISP switches via VLANs to our firewall, before the firewall allows the traffic onto the core switch?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something I see with disappointing regularity in the sysadmin subreddit, and to a lesser extent in professional life, is criticism of the "previous sysadmin". That voiceless, anonymous entity who wasn't doing backups properly, left AD in a mess, let some critical server support contracts expire...which our intrepid hero swoops in to fix with a theatrical sigh. "Just another day single-handedly keeping this company afloat...what would they do without me?"
 Besides being a cheap vehicle for self praise and narcissism, they don't seem to consider how "their" network might similarly be judged by any new sysadmin taking their position. Suspending their disbelief for a moment that anybody could possibly take over their very important and utterly unique network, they'd likely find the new sysadmin would have no problem digging out incorrect configurations, design mistakes, oversights, skeletons in the wiring closet etc. 
 Because we all have them. Every network big and small. And what we all also share are budget constraints, time pressures, staff shortages, bad management, lazy colleagues. Take these into account next time you're going to shit on the work of the previous sysadmin, especially if you don't know them personally, because I can guarantee you the next sysadmin will equally be able to shit on your work too. It's very easy to disregard the good work done and focus on the "bad".
 I just need to remind myself every time I read a comment from somebody "fixing the mess left by the previous sysadmin" that they're likely inexperienced, lack exposure to multiple networks, and desperate to display competence to their peers. I was like this too in my first few years in IT, so quick to pick out mistakes to disparage "the last guy". Now, with some experience behind me, I find myself giving them the benefit of the doubt, realise that whoever set it up this way may have had extraneous factors going against them, and could probably explain if they were there.

 We are running a cisco environment, and I'm currently managing via putty.
 I was hoping to better organize the devices, so that I can label devices by names, instead of referring to a spreadsheet when figuring out what device I need to ssh into.
 I've tried one program, maybe it was superputty, that I used to organize myself. Then, after it's software updated, it wiped all my saved device ssh log ins.
 I though it may have been my mistake, took the time to rebuild all, and it wiped again after another update.
 So I've been using putty ever since. 
 Is there an alternative that works simply, that you guys are using? I'm looking for something minimalistic and easy to use without any complex setup requirements. 
 Looking forward to your thoughts. 
 Thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings Folks,
 We are running a cisco environment, and I'm currently managing via putty.
 I was hoping to better organize the devices, so that I can label devices by names, instead of referring to a spreadsheet when figuring out what device I need to ssh into.
 I've tried one program, maybe it was superputty, that I used to organize myself. Then, after it's software updated, it wiped all my saved device ssh log ins.
 I though it may have been my mistake, took the time to rebuild all, and it wiped again after another update.
 So I've been using putty ever since. 
 Is there an alternative that works simply, that you guys are using? I'm looking for something minimalistic and easy to use without any complex setup requirements. 
 Looking forward to your thoughts. 
 Thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been looking for a new job for a while now. Around the beginning of November, I got a hit from a small digital design company looking to bring on their first dedicated IT SysAdmin/Help desk person. Their Lead designer has been their acting IT person and the job has become so much that he's not able to do any design work. I have gone through two interview rounds with them as of December 16th and they just scheduled what I presume to be the final interview for January 13th.
 Enter job number two, an international industrial software dev. I applied to this job at the beginning of December, and they got back to me a few days later. I had an initial call with the recruiter. A week later, on December 20th, I had my second interview with one of their two IT personnel. He liked me and I let him know at the end of the interview that I had already done two rounds with the first company and was expecting the third and final round around the beginning of January. He thanked me and said that changes their interview schedule a bit. The next morning, I got an email to schedule the interview with their director of IT on the 22nd. This morning (27th) I got an email that they want to schedule a call for tomorrow to talk about final steps. I presume this means an offer because the recruiter told me both people I interviewed with had positive things to say.
 So, we get to my situation. Do I send an email off to the first company to see about getting the interview moved up to maybe January 3rd if possible? I would like to have two offers to mull over rather than getting an offer and either waiting to accept, or accepting, only to get a better offer and have to rescind my acceptance from the second company?
 Edit: ok, an email has been sent. Now we wait to see what happens.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an odd one - i'm not a networking guy, much more of a generalist. We have the vendor reviewing this but they are taking their time.
 We have a box in the DMZ that has a nic in our LAN and a nic in the DMZ.
 When it's up, it causes two external facing resources to go down which also have IPs in the DMZ.
 Running a packet capture from the troublesome box reveals that the impacted resources are retransmitting many packets and I'm seeing many SACK_PERM's, but it also appears to be as though this trouble box is jumping into other conversations. Example:
 381 7.286147 [impacted resource DMZ IP] [external IP of something outside our network] TCP 68 [TCP Port numbers reused] 443 → 53905 [SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=8190 Len=0 MSS=1460 WS=256 SACK_PERM 382 7.286170 [troublesome box IP] [impacted resource DMZ IP] ICMP 96 Destination unreachable (Port unreachable)
 Where packet 382 contains the source and destination IPs from packet 381. It's like the troublesome box sees packet 381, encapsulates it, and sends it back to the impacted resource, but gets a destination unreachable. It's not doing this to all other IPs in the DMZ either, just two of them.
 Another example of the trouble box showing up after a regular ICMP
 349 6.621700 [impacted resource DMZ IP] [some external IP] ICMP 62 Echo (ping) reply id=0x0004, seq=8403/54048, ttl=255 350 6.621737 [troublesom box IP] [impacted resource DMZ IP] ICMP 80 Destination unreachable (Port unreachable)
 And packet 350 contains this under the ICMP portion of its packet: Internet Protocol Version 4, Src: [impacted resource DMZ IP], Dst: [some external IP]
 Anyone have any idea what this thing is doing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I've got a peculiar problem that I have not been able to resolve on my own. Google does not give any good results and none of the suggestions I've tried seems to help. This is a hybrid O365 enviroment, all affected users have been transfered to O365 a long time ago, problem started about 2-3 months ago.
 The problem is that some users (about a dozen or so) randomly loose the ability to send emails ie the email is not sent but stays in the Outbox folder. Only solution so far is to remove the email profile on the affected computer and create a new profile. That helps a week or so before the problem pops up again for the user.
 When the user is unable to send email I can not open the users email settings from Outlook or from the Control Panel/Mail. Nothing hapens when I try to open "Email Accounts...".
 The obvious Send/Receive manually does nothing. Outlook is online and new email arrive without problem. I've tried to reimage the computer, sfc /sannow (yes, I'm desperate), reinstall Office O365, start Outlook in safemode, resetnavpane etc etc. My google foo have not given me any good match nor solution to my problem.

 Earlier this year I joined a new company where I am now the sole IT and there are things with which I am still unexperienced. 
 In this case, we run an on-prem exchange 2019 and clients can send and receive autodiscover request, however it asks for the server type (like here) and I just couldn't find if this is normal or if the autodiscover is faulty. I have seen nowhere any clue if autodiscover should provide what type of server you are connecting or not, but my instinct tells me that the autodiscover answer from the server should provide that.
 Anyone knows where to look at to send that to clients when they do an autodiscover ? 
 I have extensively tried the tools to test Autodiscover, and it says my settings are correct, however it doesn't say where this setting is supposed to be, if it actually exists.

Plan is to migrate mails from on-prem exchange 2013 (1 server) to Microsoft365 and then get rid off on-prem exchange server, but keep on prem ad server, sql server, legacy apps, SSO (same password for mail, pc). So we want to have some kind of hybrid environment with mails being in a cloud. We dont want to reconfigure all computers (or at least amount of time if it has to be), have at least amount of downtime.
 Reading MS pages and articles online gave me some info that minimal hybrid migration would be an option. But still there will need to be on prem exchange server to manage users? Are there any solutions to this to get rid of old server or have a newer exchange version on a VM just for management? Also i dont quite understand the line from MS article "Do not plan to continue to run directory synchronization to manage your users"? Isnt this hybrid migration?
 Is there a more suitable migration path for this case?
 TLDR version, plan is to get mail in a cloud, get rid off old exchange 2013 server and manage mails on exchange online. Infrastructure remain on prem. What is the most suitable option.

They looped in their attorney, and we asked them to communicate with our legal as well. they started to increase their threats, saying there will be a 25% additional penalty if we involve legal. Is this even legal? They are retaliating if wanted our attorney to communicate with them on our behalf? We never threatened litigation or lawsuits, and only asked for our lawyer to handle communication with them as We are too busy to keep discussing it with them. They know we are valid customers, as we spend $40k+ per year on their ridiculously expensive innovyze software, which they recently acquired to add to their monopoly. Any suggestion to responding to Autodesk, when they threatens to add additional penalties to talk to our legal? We paid them the stupid 5 licenses, at this point it sounds like they like to retaliate and have their customers bend over. Funny thing is we have alternatives, unlike architects who are dependent on Revit, etc. In three years we will move towards an Autodesk free environment.

 I spend the last 1.5 years working from home, using my personal desktop computer (PC). There were several things I had to install, to let me clock in & to connect to their phone system & network. One of the things was called SentinelOne; we were only told that it was for security/malware protection, since we would have access to a lot of sensitive information; made sense, since several hacks/breaches had been in the news around that time.
 It ended up blocking my PC's internet access, except for the program itself, so that it could continue running (can't close it, 24/7) & sending regular screenshots & reports (every 4 hours). Took a ridiculous amount of time, but finally managed to make them remove it (couldn't uninstall it myself, though I'm the administrator).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I've noticed a lot of threads regarding Password Managers. Since this place has helped me grow in the last 5 years, I'd like to contribute to the community.
 Today, I've put together a How-To guide on deploying a self-hosted BitWarden instance. The guide will go over the following:
  
How-To Create the Virtual Machine
 How-To Install the Operating System
 How-To Configure the Operating System
 How-To Install BitWarden
 How-To Automate the Maintenance for BitWarden
 (Later) Admin Training Documentation
 (Later) User Training Documentation
  
To see the entire list of high-level steps for this How-To, please view the overview page here: BitWarden Self-Host Installation Overview - GitHub
 The guide is broken into 4 Chapters (5 & 6 will be made when I have time tomorrow):
  
Chapter 1: Deploy Virtual Machine: Chapter 1: Deploy Virtual Machine - Github
 Chapter 2: Operating System Setup: Chapter 2: OS Setup - Github
 Chapter 3: BitWarden Application Setup: Chapter 3: BitWarden Setup - Github
 Chapter 4: BitWarden Automated Maintenance: Chapter 4: Automated Maintenance - Github
 (Hopefully tomorrow) Chapter 5: Admin Training Documentation
 (Hopefully tomorrow) Chapter 6: User Training Documentation
  
Chapter 1 & 2 will more than likely be skipped by many of you, but it was created to show the entire process from start to finish.
 In Chapter 4, I go through on how to automate the maintenance. The PowerShell scripts do NOT have email notification enabled by default. If you have your own email functions, you can swap in your function with the one in the script and uncomment the Send-Email lines within the script(s).
 Please leave your suggestions on what I should add, remove, or change. The scripts can definitely be updated (e.g., creating a PowerShell module would be a good start).

 When hired, I was told there were possibilities for growth etc. At the time I had some college experience and a couple months in helpdesk, so it was an amazing position for me. 
 The manager of the systems team publicly stated multiple times that he wanted me on his team and I should get training to move over. That was 5 months ago. I got my AZ-900 and constantly asked for permissions to take over more work. I was only ever given permissions to do a task after a month of begging to do more. 
 I got a job offer for a Jr. sysadmin position with a significant pay raise. They are aware of my limited experience, but liked my attitude. I gave my old position one chance to match and all I got was a job description of an "associate engineer" without my name, the date, anybody's signature, pay was verbal, and no effective date. No thanks 
 I'm looking forward to escaping the out of the SD for obvious reasons, but expect to come across an entirely different set of issues lol. I was the glue that held that team together, and I know for a fact that two people will be leaving right after me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a software engineer by trade, now a manager of software engineers. Three years ago my company (around 100 people) had an IT Director, A VP of Technology and an Assistant IT Director. The VP of Technology moved on. Then the IT Director moved on and the assistant was elevated and finally he left a little over a year ago.
 Recently my company asked me to be Director of IT and I said no. I got a look at what all needed to be done, our security needs, etc. and decided it was too much for one person and not what I wanted to be doing, so I said they should hire someone and turned them down.
 Recently, they started asking me to tackle specific IT tasks as one-offs and I’m finding myself drifting back towards a role I said no to. Being asked to take on more and more responsibilities related to IT. 
 I’m not sure what my question really is. I’m just lamenting the situation, I think. With some institutional support for decision making and maybe some staff to actually execute, maybe I could do the job. I don’t have the experience specifically in IT, though, and I’m muddling through based on having 2 decades of general software experience and enough systems experience to be dangerous.
 There is definitely more to this job, however, these days. More than just knowing how these systems work. There’s prioritizing the various risks the company faces and executing the implementation of systems and processes that we’re now behind on from years of neglect. To say nothing of how to deal with upgrading equipment, budgeting for long term maintenance, etc. It just feels very overwhelming and I’m wondering if it’s crazy that I just want to walk away.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MDF flooded today (12/26). Well more than just the MDF, like most of the building flooded today when the fire suppression system and water main exploded in multiple places. We're talking 110PSI of water flying out from an 8 inch water main somewhere in the ceiling and just destroying everything. I had a co-worker show me video of a poor HP prodesk getting blasted with unbelievably high pressure water.
 This actually started on xmas (yesterday), I was watching over the cams remotely and seeing the mess unfold. At the time it didn't affect me so I just sat at home and watched the chaos unfold. I thought they turned the water off for the whole building but today around noon - more water lines exploded in a few more places - and one of those was the MDF.
 By the time I got in there, it was no longer raining from the ceiling. 
 It was bad - water was pouring out of the 5x Aruba switches that sent network to the rest of the building, about 7/8 of the network was offline. Luckily the server room and about two IDFs not in the chain were fine. Basically, only the basement of the building near the server room, and one random hallway was unaffected.
 After 3 hrs of using a leaf blower to help the internals of the switches dry, I decided to go for broke and connected them back and they all worked! That part of the network was only down for about 4 hours, so in all honesty I think it worked out pretty well, most people were out of the office so it wasn't that much of an interruption.
 It will hold for tonight but I think I'm going to get my 10g network upgrade very soon. Eventually corrosion will kill those switches.

 I'm trying to set up an Apache as a temporary forward proxy. Actually all it has to do is forward everything to the actual proxy server until some client misconfiguration has been sorted out.
 My config works for http connections but all https connections fail.
 here is the virtual host config:
 <VirtualHost *:8001> ServerAdmin webmaster@localhost DocumentRoot /var/www/html ErrorLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/error.log CustomLog ${APACHE_LOG_DIR}/access.log combined ProxyRequests On ProxyVia On SSLProxyEngine On ProxyRemote "*" "http://xx.xx.xx.xx:9091" </VirtualHost> 
 The error in the log says
 AH01144: No protocol handler was valid for the URL...
 Anyone here can help me out how to get it to work with https? The SSL doesn't need to be terminated on the Apache. Everything should just be shoved to the actual proxy.

 I left the industry just over a year ago, in order to fully commit to my business, and I'm absolutely certain it saved my life.
 Back in 2011 I started working at a small (10 - 40 people) company that managed insurance claims for private companies and public bodies like water boards, regional councils etc - a few years before I left we even managed to secure work with the government, including some government ministries. My main role throughout that time was IT Manager, but as with all small firms, I had to wear several hats - everything from sysadmin through to contract negotiations, and fixing laptop screens.
 Reflecting on my experiences now I think it's a wonder I didn't end up in hospital, or take my own life…]]></summary>

 They will either break stuff with updates or the fixes are questionable and you feel like you have to put them off for a month or two just so it doesn't cause any unneeded stress and extra work. If it's not Microsoft killing something then it's a user needing something after hours or on a day off. (I'm the only IT guy for the company which I know will start other conversations but that's not the point of this post)
 I've been getting into Linux here lately and was wondering if a Linux sysadmin position would be any different.
 I guess a lot of it will depend on the company and support structure so it could be possible to jump to a different company/position with the exact same issues that aggravate me now.
 Maybe I'm just getting burned out and looking for something different (less stress and responsibility) but that would require starting over and probably taking a pretty big pay cut.

 A few weeks ago, I left my job of 7 years as a solo sysadmin at a small company. I felt underappreciated by mgmt and was getting tired of everything landing on my plate. I wanted to be part of a team and have co-workers to collaborate with.
 I ended up at a large MSP about 2 weeks ago, but I'm starting to regret my decision. The position is remote, the benefits are good and the pay is decent, with no overtime/on-call necessary, but I'm starting to question whether I made the right decision.
 For starters, the position requires a lot more time on the help desk than previously indicated. The documentation is lacking and nobody on my team really seems to know what's going on. Every client's environment is…]]></summary>

 Year 2- RTM happens and it starts to sell well. Company goes public. Two guys no longer care about the product as they are multi-millionaires with hot girlfriends. 
 Year 3- A third party comes in to manage the company. They no longer listen to the community. They look for ways to squeeze more money to investors. Turnover is high. Support is sent offshore to companies who barely speak your language.
 Year 4- Every new release makes the product worse. Every new patch breaks something else. Customers already invested too much time and money to switch products. Customers complain but there's now no one to call or answer emails besides the offshore support company, and they are useless.
 Year 5- Sales start to tank. Company comes up with an idea to bundle the now horrible SW with other products that do sell and turns it into a subscription.
 Year 6- Company is delisted and the SW is sold multiple times to equally horrible companies who try to sunset the product and get you to move to their other more profitable products.
 Year 7- SW assets are sold multiple times over the years until no one will buy the product and it fades away.
 Year 8- Two guys come with a good idea for a product...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I received an offer for a network support position ( network administrator ) in a managed private cloud service provider ( VMWare, Azure as vendor ). Currently working at a TAC for a known network vendor supporting their firewall.
 I'm worried that this role being mostly support ( few change requests, policies, VPN tunnels, VLANs etc. ) could be less benefiting from a career perspective than a more generic network engineer role in an enterprise enviorement ( as it would include maintenance, support, planning , deployment etc.
  
Please share your opinion in the above worries.
 Can you switch into an enterprise role easily after a support role from an MSP?
 How do companies offering contract role view MSP experience?
  
They highlighted that the role is challenging at least 20 times during two interviews and that after 6-12 months project work ( FW deployments, migratons etc. ) can be requested as well.
 Tech stack: - Firewalls: Fortinet, Clavister - Cisco ASR Routers - Switches: Arista, Cumulus - VMWare NSX - NO Automation, NO SD-WAN 
 Tickets are highly variated, examples but not limited to: - Change requests - L2/L3 redundancy - IPSec, SSL VPN, interconnects - Generic R/S TS

 If so, what are you looking at?
 We've just renewed support for our vSphere licensing for 3 years to give the business some runway to figure out if we are going to stick around or not. 
 That gives us time to see how much of a damn dumpster fire this Broadcom deal is going to be, but I figured I would see what others are doing.
 Hyper-V is high on my list as we are a Microsoft shop primarily, but XCP-NG looks favorable too. Red Hat Virtualization seems promising as I have played with oVirt but is daunting to deploy. 
 Anyway, thanks in advance for the feedback!

 I had to tell them the classic Linux WiFi example from back in the days of forums where you just didn't ask the question or you would end up with dozens of smart-ass comments and no answers or everyone letting you know you are a dumbass ass for not knowing a simple config. You had to pose it as a challenge or insult. They understood.
 The classic Linux WiFi example - When you have a problem you need help with, how you deliver the question makes all the difference in getting a fix. For example if your wifi stopped working on Ubuntu never go on the forum with a question asking for help to get your wifi working. No matter how detailed you are all you will get is snarky comments, RTFM, you are a dumbass, any noob should know that, and no answer. 
 No, if you want a solution quickly simply post "Ubuntu 10.04 Linux is a hacked together piece shit that won't even support wifi on my Lenovo T43. I'm going back to Windows." Now check your post in about an hour and you'll have a hundred comments calling you a dumbass but also another hundred comments with a step-by-step solution just to prove you wrong that wifi does indeed work on Ubuntu. That my friends is how to get answers on the Internet.

Before, on my Windows 2012 VPS, I was using Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer to scan it for vulnerabilities that hackers could use to hack into my VPS. Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer was quite good and if my memory is correct, it would also check your ports, check if certain protocols were enabled that hackers could abuse (ie. checked if SMBv1 was enabled), etc, which was really useful.
 Unfortunately, Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer (MBSA) has been discontinued by Microsoft and I don't think the last version is even applicable to Windows Server 2019/2022. Is there another very popular software that administrators use to scan a Windows Server for vulnerabilities and if so, how much does it cost (MBSA was free)?

 Their website has some pretty good info on it around their security model and how secure they are but of course "they would say that wouldn't they" seems to apply.
 I have a few people who've been using LastPass now asking me what I'd recommend and usually I say to look at Bitwarden or 1Password but this looks quite good.
 Is anyone using them please and if so what's your feedback on the product both for enterprise and individual use?

For a couple very small sites I know, it estimated <200 visitors in a month, and the rank was like somewhere in the millions. For a much larger site, like cbs.com, it reported/estimated it at top 100 or so, and I think I entered 'facebook.com' and it said #2 at 600MM visitors. I understand these estimates are directional at best, but I thought it was a neat addition to a typical whois search, which doesn't really reveal much these days with GDPR in effect.
 I was using Private Mode on Firefox, so it didn't log in my history, and I can't remember the site now and it's driving me nuts. Anyone have a lead? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys! First time posting on this subreddit, so please forgive me for any mistakes. 
 I am starting a company where I will give my partners/users, an android device, which has a few apps they still use to access my service. The concept is kind of like doordash, but perhaps a bit more individual. 
 For this system I have been looking into a few things, among other things the Soto MobiControl system. To give a better insight of what’s needed and why I will provide a short description below.
  
A way to remotely access the devices so that my team can do the debugging in case something goes wrong, instead of having to try and explain to the users what to do. 
 With this I am also looking to heavily restrict what apps can be accessed, and also settings so the device can only be used for its actual purpose, and the chance for problems by pressing something wrong occurring decreases.
 An easy way to automatically set up the devices with the right apps and restrictions, perhaps using a connection to a pc or something along those lines.
  
I have looked a bit into the Soti platform, but as far as I have understood I need a dedicated server with databases and stuff to use their solution, which is per today not an option. 
 The perfect scenario would be a cloud based system for accessing the above mentioned functions, preferably a cheap one too since we are a completely new company with not much money to spend. I am looking forward to you guys’ ideas!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been handed over an issue that is a strange one. We use AnyConnect for NAM only and F5 for our VPN.
 There's multiple windows laptops (MACs aren't experiencing this issue) that run into an issue in which when they disconnect from the F5 VPN or when the VPN session times out their WiFi connection will drop and AnyConnect will either sit there and say associating to their home WiFi network or say "No Adaptors Available". The issue will persist until either the AnyConnect client/service is ended or the laptop is rebooted.
 Cisco TAC insists it's not AnyConnect. Microsoft doesn't feel like touching it since it's 3rd party software. 
 Our client team has tried every WiFi driver they could get their hands on. They've tried Windows 10 and Windows 11. They've tried a fresh image. All resulted in the same symptoms.
 Has anyone seen these kind of issues before? Any solutions or suggestions?

 Find out that the IT person copied the documentation to the server and threw out the book. They also got rid of immutable backups because it costed to much money. 
 They offered me my old pay (per hour) to help.

 I have used, and will continue to use, the example of cracking the verifier, as that has a nice analogy to cracking password hashes on a traditional service like Barkbook. But what is at stake here is whether Mr. Talk, given access to what is stored on our servers, would have the capacity to decrypt Molly’s data. Molly’s 1Password Secret Key means that the answer is no. Mr. Talk would not be able to crack that even if he put every computer on Earth to work on the cracking and ran them for zillions of times the age of the universe. I am happy to use words like “never” and “impossible” for that.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Team is looking at using RedSeal's on prem tool to map our network out. Supposedly you can ingest firewall rules from your devices into the program and it plots out your network for you, showing you what could potentially be exposed to the internet and on what ports so you can review and shutdown any open holes you're not fully aware about or got lost in bad documentation/poor communication issues.
 It's pretty pricy though, the 1st demo I had looked decent but the inventory side of it i've already accomplished via Netbox. I could do the network topology too via Netbox but that's manually entering things in instead of allowing a tool to go out, grab the firewall rules and ingest it properly. I'm sure there's a ansible script method I could use to poll all that info and feed it up into Netbox's api but that's more work then I have the time for currently.
 Was curious if there were any other open source alternatives to this tool or people's thoughts and opinions on it?
 Mostly a RHEL/Ubuntu shop with some Windows hosts peppered throughout.

 Long time lurker here and nonnative English speaker.
 ​
 Prior to my current role I have worked as helpdesk and field support specialist.
 I love computers and am always motivated to play around on my homelab.
 At home I have an ESXi and Hyper-V host with, Windows server with domain stuff, Linux VM’s, OPNsense, Docker, unRAID, VEEAM. I have 11 entry level IT certifications, MCSA, Exchange, LPIC, ITIL, Comptia, CCNA the basic stuff.
 At the moment I work in an office as internal IT in a team with 3 other junior admins. We are the escalation point of the helpdesk which does suck because we still have to do helpdesk work. The helpdesk techs are on the lowest level I have seen in my career, tech and communication wise.
 My coworkers like to waste half of the day talking about Marvel with the helpdesk technicians and all other types of nonsense. (This will not improve with current management and will probably take years to turn around)
 I currently work on IT projects with other teams and my senior colleague which is interesting. But I do not get any useful input from the other junior admins, they prefer slacking off and goofing around. So, I am kind of a one-man army I have only my senior colleague as a sparring partner and he has a full schedule.
 I find it hard to stay motivated, I am the most technically knowledgeable person in IT besides the senior admin and architect. My colleagues do not show any interest in improving and I have to spoon-feed the helpdesk. So it feels like I do all the giving.
 Does anyone have any tips to deal with this?

 We have had issues with techs changing port configs for key systems or taking things out of agg groups because they don't understand what they are used for. Even after these mistakes I would push towards POLP and they would shoot it all down.
 Well today I'm having to rebuild an ESXi cluster due to another issue caused by untrained people having access to key systems. I'm sure when I go to the lead meeting on Wednesday they will still shoot down my suggestions.
 Who else has to deal with this nonsense? I'm all for people leveling up but a production environment is not the place for this.

I have been told that geolocation rules do not apply to people connecting to the VPN and for example if someone tried connecting to our network from a country we block such as North Korea or Russia and they had someone’s credentials they would have access. I can’t see how this would even be possible or even allowed? We require Duo for additional verification but I am sure there are a ton of people that don’t do this.

 However, when I try "what is my IP address" in the browser, I see the same IP address, so I'm puzzled.
 Shouldn't the IP address be different too ?

Inside the box will be an 8 port network switch. Switch will be connected via fiber down the pole and into buried conduit back to the main building.
 The NEMA boxes will be in direct sunlight. It's Florida. It's humid. And also, tt's going to be really effing hot in those boxes.
 I've found a few switches rated up to 60C but I don't think that's high enough, based on our testing. Last summer, we put one of the NEMA boxes in direct sun and put a simple mechanical thermometer inside and it did in fact reach 65C/150F. 
 So... anybody got any ideas that can do PoE (only maybe 50W total) and survive these kinds of environments? Or some other way of doing this?

 I’m thinking of postpone the script and has a medium or something to approve the script after the error has been corrected. 
 PowerAutomate seems promising with the cloud flow + desktop flow integration (premium license). Something along the line of sending email to a monitoring mailbox, extract the body, condition check the extracted body, and call desktop flow to trigger another PowerShell script. 
 Discussed internally and one guy bring up using teams to triggers power automate process. How does this works, does it work with a 1-1 chat or has to be teams channel chat. I looked up google but nothing really pin point my answer. A lot of posts hinted to a teams channel. 
 Anyone has any working automated approval process for scripting or anything similar?

 I solve all kinds of problems and face all kinds of situations without anyone's help.
 I see my other co-workers and they are usually wasting time on social media watching videos, memes or things like that.
 Yesterday we had a brief meeting with the head of the IT department and he said that his goal is that we all get the same payment, even knowing that their level of education is different (I have undergraduate, graduate and I'm studying to get a CCNA certificate) and the others didn't even went to college.
 Honestly, I can't understand why. It seems like all the effort I put in doesn't bring any return and I'm tired of it because when things get tough I'm always "need to be" there to help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would like to set up a tftp server in AWS to provide a central place to copy equipment configurations to, from network equipment I have all over the world. 
 I am able to connect to the tftp server on udp/69 but the data transfer to copy the data on an alternate udp port seems be blocked. I have permitted all udp ports on the security group for the instance, but not luck. Does anyone know of any other location in AWS / VPC that may block udp traffic of a tftp server?
 I was able to verify that the tftp server does work. I am able to transfer data via tftp within a VPC subnet. It does not work when the traffic is coming from outside the VPC 
 Also I tested two different tftp servers, tftp64 on windows, and in.tftpd on Linux,.and the same behavior occurs on each system. 
 To reiterate. Connections on port udp/69 work. The file name comes through to the server and the server creates the file name to be written to. But the data stream that transfers the actual file data on an alternate udp port seems to be blocked and no data is written to the file. 
 I am stuck, but would like to learn more about AWS plumbing. And felt this might be a pertinent issue to other folks on this sub.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We started using MS Defender Plan 2 for email protection, which gave us two canned presets, Strict and Standard. I have several users on the strict policy, but I don't like that it's immutable, i.e., no granular control. And it seems to stop processing rules below its priority, so incompatible settings never get applied. For instance, it won't allow the first contact warning tags, and it isn't campatible with spam notifications and letting the users release their own. I don't need all that work. So my question is: Is there anything the presets do that can't be done by building my own policies? Can I still get the same level of impersonation protection, etc.? Thx!

 ​
 ​
 I will design DFS-N environment for my company. But I have some your valueable ideas.
 ​
 1 - (Option 1 )DFS-N multi namespaces for each department or (Option 2) DFS-N single namespace for all department. What's best practices for this ?
 ​
 I want to config very manageable structure.
 ​
 ​
 Option 1 :

 ​
 ​
 Option 2 :

 ​
 ​

 ​
 ​
 ​
 2- What's best practices for those permissions for DFS-N environment? I will setup something like that. 
 ​
 ​
 e.g
 ​
 ​
 DFS NameSpace Name : DATA
 ​
 ​
 Permissions : (Everyone removed, & Authenticated Users = Read) under Customize and FULL Control for Administrators
  \-- IT (Folder) --> Folder Target : NS\_IT 
 NS_IT : Sharing Perm : IT_SG : Modify and FULL Control for Administrators
 NTFS Perm : IT_SG : Modify and FULL Control for Administrators
 ​
 ​
 ​
 3 - I will use Item-level Targeting for drive mapping. I will use Security Groups. Also I want to do the drive mapping for each department.
 ​
 So , G for IT DePartment ,H for HR Deparment and so on. 
 ​
 Lets say , any user moved from the IT department to the HR department. How can I manage the GPO here?
 ​
 ​
 Now I have tested it. I have created a GPO like below.
 ​
 But , although the user moves to the HR department, IT sharing mapping still remains.
 ​
 GPO:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 We are planning to migrate Azure AD Connect from version 1.6.x to the latest version on a new server, via the staging mode method. I already did this in the past, and the process is quite straightforward.
 But in this context, this is a bit different. In the initial configuration of Azure AD Connect, ADFS was configured as the sign-in method. So, during the the AAD Connect wizard on the new server, we have to choose « Federation with ADFS » at the « Sign-in » step, and then, selecting the existing ADFS farm.
 My main concern is about the next step "Azure AD domain": (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/hybrid/media/how-to-connect-install-custom/adfs6.png)
 We have several federated domains, and here we can choose only one. What will be the impact for all the other ones ? And also for the one that I will select ? All these domains are already correctly federated, I don't really understand what will happen at this step. Do we have to expect user impact ?
 Thanks for your help. Kevin

 I have been doing some googling and some old recommendations seems to be Squid with DansGuardian ( we prefer Linux based platforms ) but i notice DansGuardian is no longer a thing. E2Guardian seemed to take over but that also no longer seems to be active.
 Can anyone recommend a current open source platform we can use that can be cloud based on our own server.

 - While interning at a company the devs were in bed and suddenly the service went down, no-one had the willingness to get up and SSH into the server and fix it. Fix was a restart. Overenergetic intern was willing but not granted SSH access since even with minimal permissions it's a security risk and interns cannot be trusted with production server.
 - While interning as a backend dev, push to staging branch auto deployed the changes, but since maintaining SSH credentials for every employee/intern is tedious, I had to Slack call the server person and get a screenshot of logs which was a pain

 MobXcess is a tool suite that can run commands 🛠️ on your server☁️ from your mobile📱 device securely
 PS: No SSH Needed 🤫🙅‍♂️
 MobXcess is developed in two parts:
  
Server-Side system developed using Golang
 Client-Side system developed using Flutter
  
The communication is secured using AES-256-GCM cryptography.
 Since it's a REST API, adding SSL will elevate security to a new level.

 merry xmas!
 Does anyone know if there is a source with all the IP Ranges used by Microsoft Autenticator? We would like to use the Location part of the new number-matching feature of Microsoft Authenticator.
 However, since we are using a web proxy it keeps showing a location very far away from where the user actually sits (depending on web proxy location - ZScaler in our environment). The idea would be to exclude the IPs from ZScaler in order to get real and authentic location information.
 How did you solve the issue?
 The obvious alternative would be to deactivate the location matching in the Authenticator but we actually like the feature.

 So it is Christmas morning, I wake up to a phone call from our on-call agent who also happens to be the senior architect/engineer/sysadmin/flavor of the day. "Are you still in town?" Without thinking, I stupidly answered "yes". That was how I got to spend Christmas day traveling hours to a rural radio tower and replacing a dead firewall.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a little ways into an MSP job that requires daily standup meetings that often run for 90 minutes or more. I'm making my best effort to pay attention and take notes (if for no other reason than to force myself to focus), but I often find myself tuning out anyway. And I won't know until several minutes into a topic discussion that my boss is going to conclude the discussion by assigning the matter to me, whether or not my attention span had failed me 45 minutes into the meeting.
 Which brings me to my point: I need technology assistance here. What software solutions can the community recommend to live transcribe these meetings using the microphone on an Intel Macbook Pro? Unfortunately, it looks like the built-in Mac live caption software only works on Apple silicon. I'm willing to pay money if that's what it takes, but hoping to avoid shelling out for full-blown Dragon.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel as if Azure ADDS is extremely limited, I realize that it isn't a replacement for ADDS, but being cloud only and having multiple vendors who use/integrate LDAP, it seems that Azure ADDS has very limited functionality. No way to integrate ADDS into Azure ATP, Cannot do custom delegation, one way sync from Azure and if I want to move groups to different OU's, I'm having to create them in ADDS, but can't reverse sync them to Azure, machines also don't hybrid join, so having a hard time with intune GPOs, the list could go on...
 Recommendations? I think having devices join to AAD is great with Intune, but I don't think being cloud-only for identities, and not having an on-prem instance is ideal.
 Ideally, I'm thinking we leave the environment in it's current state, but move identities on-prem, including groups, and sync everything via AD Connect, while leaving machines joined to AAD, so on-prem won't really need to be open all over with VPN tunnels flying around, just for the purpose of syncing objects, servers, VM's, etc and far better management. Thoughts?

 We currently have 3 ESXi 6.7 hosts connected to a 140TB HPE Nimble CS-1000 on 10gbps iScsi. This Nimble only has 4TB of deduplication capacity. The Unity 380 we were quoted is 384TB with the first shelf (about 74TB) being all SSD, the remaining capacity is 7200 rpm HDDs. 
 Looking for advice and opinions on HPE vs. EMC in this configuration. Most of our storage usage comes from Windows 2016/19 file server VMs.
 How would you compare HPE Nimble to EMC Unity especially in regard to deduplication?
 All of our ESXi hosts are Dell R750s (upgrading from R730s)
 Thank you for any help or advice.

It spins and spins like it is testing, but the fields are blank and no results ever show up. The wire map test still functions fine. So has my $180 cable tester has just became a basic wire map tester going forward? 
 Anybody experience this TDR testing issue with theirs?

New job is over a 60% salary increase, better PTO, and explicitly remote. The current place made a counter offer to match and offered a 75k retention bonus paid out after 1 and 2 years in a 25/75% split. 
 The day before I had my interview scheduled, it was announced that the company was acquired. While larger, the acquiring company's IT infrastructure is lagging behind and was hoping to leverage my company's expertise to help modernize their systems and processes. That expertise heavily is me.
 Fuck em. I make less now than when I was hired due to inflation, and it's like that across all departments. If you're not at the exec level, they don't care about CoL. I might get my piece but my team is still going to get their shit raises. And I'm just... jaded. I don't think I could be happy with anything they offer.
 I'm spending all my time left brain dumping and documenting, I'm not going to make stuff hard for my team. I wish I could take them with me, and I've warned my managers that a couple of them are definitely underpaid and may lose them. 
 Best Christmas in a long time.

 I think there is a need for every engineer to do some basic scripting as it can save a significant amount of time. I can appreciate the skill, but I just haven't been able to bring myself to enjoy it.
 Working with python and go have just felt awful for me, especially the xml, json and expect stuff.
 Shell scripting feels a bit more natural since I don't spend time reinventing the wheel on a ton of functions and I can just pipe to other programs. It's like a black box. I throw in some input and out comes what I need. It's not without it's issues either.

 Ideally, I want a simple sensor we can just data cable (not WiFi) to a switch, with a basic cloud based server. It would alert us (via text, email, or app notification) when the temperature goes outside of a specified range or when it loses connectivity or fails to report within a certain time period. And last, keep a record of temperature reported so, when it loses connection, we can see what the trend was. 
 It seems to me this is a decently big ask on a small budget, but I thought I'd reach out and see if anyone has an experience or recommendations in this field. So far Google has brought up a bunch of options without much context of what is a good option and what is not.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 We're a medium sized MSP (250 employees) and we're currently using LastPass and in the light of what happened we're really unsure of what service to continue with, and currently leaning towards not continuing with LastPass. But before we decide fully we want to do some evaluating on LastPass. Our Yearly subscription renews at the start of February and so we decided we want to switch to a monthly payment play in order to not commit to a full year.
 So on hold for their billing support for 1H because you cant cancel auto subscription on your own, you have to call them.
 Then they proceed to tell me that they dont have a monthly subscription, only monthly billing. Meaning I will still be committed for a year even if I pay monthly.
 So I essentially tell them that in that case I will have to cancel because I don't want to commit for a year
 They respond with saying "Go ahead cancel then because we only do yearly subscriptions".
 Honestly, hope they go under.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wrote a small GUI-based tool that uses the Windows Imaging Format (WIM) to create full backups of computer systems (operating system images) and then restore them.
 The application is hosted on GitHub, is open source, and is offered under the Apache 2.0 license.
 In addition, the repository includes an illustrated step-by-step guide to help get it up and running.
 Maybe someone can use the solution for their purposes as well - I would be happy. Have fun with it.
 Brief summary:
  
WIM backup always requires an external bootable media such as a USB flash drive.
 From this drive WinPE is booted to perform a backup or restore to or from an external medium (e.g. a USB hard drive).
 On the bootable USB flash drive the WinPE must be set up before (is documented illustrated in the readme).
 After completion of the respective operation, a status message is displayed whether the operation was successful or failed.
 After restoring a backup, you can boot normally from the destination drive.
 Both the backup and restore process are relatively simple (not "rocket science").
 To set up the solution, you need about 30 minutes time in the best case due to the necessary downloads (e .g. ADK)
  
The project can be found here: WIM-Backup

 The CCR2216 has 2x QSFP28 ports capable of 100Gbps, and 12x SFP28 ports capable of 25Gbps.
 The MS355-24 has 4x QSFP ports capable of 40 Gbps.

 Any help with this setup is greatly appreciated! Thank you.

 The computer name and license key used are listed and we don't recognize the computer as it isn't named the way we name our PCs.
 I email Autodesk support and get this response:
 "I understand that you have gotten a verification/registration email for a computer that your organization does not recognize, my name is Dionne, and I am happy to help. However, I apologize, but we can't see where the installations of products are made from. My apologies. 
 Best,

 So basically, they have no way to track where their software is installed . So they should not be relied on when they want you to pay for more licenses for more seats since they cant prove anything.
 Absolutely asinine.

 Some context: I like the relaxed pace of doing local in house, I can handle it well with my slight anxiety. But my current employer has 0 place to grow (after promising tons of place for growth when being hired), and after asking for a raise, I heard through the grapevine, HR/management was wanting to give my job to an offshore employee that makes $6/hr. Which they obviously didn't when they realized that's impossible. (I do their daily physical maintenance and support as well, basically 3 jobs in 1)
 This isn't far from NYC btw. 
 Im always seeing horror stories in here about MSP's but the money would be life improving.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for advice on Mitel VOIP appliances. Recently joined the business and there is a Mitel VOIP appliance in play for the usual VOIP business requirements. Took a look at the setup and at first glance there is some good practice: the VOIP is hosted on linux servers sitting in their own VLAN segmented from the rest of the network. The only public facing server is the Mitel's conference bridge suite. 
 But there is something i dont understand cause i lack experience with this VOIP software - 1) the controller is being hosted on a Windows OS, iirc its supposed to be on Linux boxes, 2) the devices are domain joined - so i assume the creds of our admins when they are logging in and out of the Windows OS VOIP controller, will be leaving their creds behind in memory no? Or even a LSASS dump could result in compromise of any domain admins that have administered the Mitel suite in the separate VLAN? Am I panicking over nothing here?
 Seems kind of obvious to me that eventually someone will pop the internet-facing conference bridge, move to the Windows OS controller server in the same VLAN, and then dump creds until they find one that can break them out of the VOIP VLAN and get into the rest of the network. 
 Any thoughts?
 Should the Mitel VOIP stuff be domain joined? 
 Should any of the VOIP VMs be a Windows OS?
 Is this setup as vulnerable as i feel it is?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I would like to setup a personal lab for PowerShell practice/testing, which I can't do at work, and for which I can't accommodate the tin (or a VM) at home.
 Is there a facility where I can have a suitably isolated hosted VM as if an "on prem" DC with AD services, which I can then sync with a Tenancy in AAD/365? 
 I could just buy a vanity domain + DNS hosting, a hosted VM with Windows Server Licence, link to a Tenancy, and go from there - but even for just a half-dozen dummy users with an E1 or two thrown in, my test bed is costing a sizeable chunk of salary.
 Conversely, though, I recognise any hosting is going to incur some cost, and that's "fine".
 Any suggestions please?

 yesterday at around 3pm the our Hyper-V server started running hot and the fans were on full blast. Due to the exchange being there etc. I couldn't restart it before 9pm from home.
 Today at 7am I arrived in the server room and it was super hot (temps said 30 degrees) so I remoted in, powered it off and unplugged it.
 I then carried up a mobile a/c and turned it on to 17 degrees, the a/c inside the server room at 18 degrees (both on high) and turned it on again.
 It's now 12am, and the fans still run at 100%, Hyper-V manager doesn't show any significant VM load (around 2% CPU max.).
 What could the issue be? I opened the door so cold air gets in from the floor, and the a/c's are still running. The fans should start powering down once the room cools down, no? 
 How come it still runs at a 100% even though it's significantly cooler there now?

 ​
 Looking for genuine opinions whether Microsoft Unified Support is bringing you value for money if you are using it.
 Yes it is quite pricey, but we are going all in in Azure and 365 and have struggled with getting good quality support from partners so are looking for alternatives.
 Most times we get support from MS, the initial engagement is problematic, but once I start having conversations (moaning...) with our MS account managers and they escalate the incidents to the right person, issues get resolved promptly. It appears that having Unified Support may well get you to the 'right person' quickly.

 100 user company on 365 business premium, hybrid environment, roughly 10TB of data, hosted on-prem right now.
 What is the easiest lift that can keep file/folder permission in place and allows easy mapping via GPO? I'm working on getting Intune/AutoPilot set up, testing how the enrollment process works in a hybrid environment now. Haven't seen to many examples for hybrid specific in my research, but I digress. 
 Obviously we have a company OneDrive, I believe 1 TB for biz prem, I would think you could increase the capacity for a fee. Issue is permissions are not a one to one from my understanding. SharePoint is also an option but again, kind of a mess for management in my limited experience. And now there is Azure Files, that seems promising but being my first foray into Azure, seems pricey. 
 Ideally I don't want to redo any permissions and need to have a reliable way to map drives for users. Curious to see what others have done. Thanks in advance

 I am in the process of revamping our service desk team to shift their mindset from reactive to tickets coming in the desk to proactive with a focus on ticket reduction through anticipating customer needs, automation to streamline/free You resources and delivering white glove service.
 I am curious to hear any success stories on areas you’ve focused and seen great success in addition to red flags/issues that came up with unintended consequences.
 Some of the areas of focus for 2023 are: - improve work from home experience and technology performance - conduct a monthly “check up” With all employees with at least 3 being video - revamp onboarding experience and shorten day 1 orientation timeframe - while supporting an issue, proactively review drivers/vulnerabilities/windows updates and address those before logging off.
 These are just a few examples of ways that we’re focused on prevention/proactive/mindset shift
 Any feedback on things that have/have not worked for you?
 Greatly appreciate the insight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm currently working as IT support, and most of the issues I get reported end up being because of simple windows 10 updates, I was wondering is there a way to modify something on each computer so they force update every time there's any kind of update, I want this computers to search and install updates the moment they are turned on. there's already a policy on the active directory but is not that efficient and I don't have the authority to modify it yet and even if i had the authority it's not that efficient... If you guys know a proven way to archive this please let me know, I think this would help a lot of people working as IT support around the world.

 Long story short been at this company for about 6+ months that’s just a one man show (aka me) and just feels like they are abusing it and not getting the help I need. Other positions I’ve had is either MSP or in healthcare where it’s a hit or miss when it comes to pay. 
 Been in a salary position for the last 3+ years but been offered a job where it’s more pay but it’s an hourly pay vs salary. Any suggestions on how to go about this?

 I have been tasked with upgrading the fleet of Office 365 Installs for 80~ Devices.
 These devices all are using office 365 2013 Pro Plus Im needing to upgrade them all to Pro plus 2019.
  
I have generated an installer and an xml file from config.office.com. 
 I have downloaded all the relevant files with the /download switch in the batch file
  
Im having some issues when it comes to trying to install
  
My install O365.bat file is located in \\DC\netlogon\Office Deployment Upgrade: https://imgur.com/a/MKfK17F I have the @pushd and @popd in this batch file becuase the file is in a network location. It was the only way I could allow this file to be ran on an end user machine
 When I run this file I get an error message around the files not being able to be downloaded: https://imgur.com/a/Ouw61rt
  
Im also needing to figure out how to push this batch file once and only once so it only uninstalls 2013 and upgrades once. Wether I use PDQ or a one time scheduled task im not sure. 
 I have been at this for days and im yet to figure it out
 If anyone can assist that would be great
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are you ready for this nightmare story?
 I have a Virtual environment (VMWare, Microsoft) and lost everything on the SAN including VMs and backups. Data recovery is in the process but it will take weeks at best and I am not getting any high confidence from the data recovery team. I have an online backup of user data but no viable backup of the actual DC or any other servers that I can restore. I say that, but there is a remote possibility that I can restore my DC from 6 months ago when we upgraded from 2008 to 2022 and swapped roles, etc., however, that is looking like a pipe dream as well (this would be the 2008 server).
 It is a Hybrid Office 365 environment with on-prem DCs and Azure AD (free) for authentication and all. I am assuming that if I were to create everything from scratch (new Forest and DC) there is a high likelihood of all mailboxes getting affected as well because the on-prem SIDs and GUIDs and Object IDs would be different from what they were previously. Waiting for weeks isn't happening but I need at least some domain functions back to survive the carnage.
 I am looking for some bright ideas to get out of this mess!!!!
 My terrible options at the moment are:
  
Create everything from scratch and deal with hybrid issues later
 Hope and try to restore the DC from 6 months ago and minimize the impact to only new users from that point on.
 Can Azure AD be the savior here? - Can the information in the cloud be used to spin up a DC in the cloud? - If that is possible, does this mean I am not fully cloud-based domain environment, or can I then also have an on-prem spun up later?
  
I am sure there are some bright minds out there to help navigate this mess.
 Thank you!!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a year ago, my manager let me know he was going to be moving to another team and my department director would like to promote me to my manager's position. Nice! Over the following months this shifted to, "we have to post the position and you'll need to apply, but you're our candidate of choice." Interviews were earlier this month and I didn't make it past the first round of interviews. My director pulled me aside afterwards to say that I interviewed well, but he had decided to look for someone with more experience. It sucks but business can be that way, I'll just keep my resume updated.
 ​
 Later, it was dropped that the new manager won't be meeting with our team at any point during the interview process. This manager will also report to two directors; during my interview it became clear they had directly opposing ideas of what the new manager should achieve, (director 1 said it would be the new manger's job to take on work from their team and say no to new work from director 2, director 2 said exactly the opposite), and it very much gave me "divorced parents arguing through the kids" vibes.
 ​
 After thinking about this for a bit, I never would entertain an offer like this if it had come from another organization. If I was applying for a manager role and couldn't meet the team at least once and was expected to report to multiple directors with directly opposing expectations, I never would consider the role!
 ​
 While it sucks that I was strung along for so long, I'm grateful that it helped me see that this probably wasn't a position I would be happy with, and that a healthy organization probably wouldn't make these kinds of decisions.

You’d expect it to be a forever issue if they’re average.

 we are running a OLD fileserver (Windows Server 2012R2) with a really big multiple data-disk (D:\ , E:\, G:\, H:\ ,J:\ , M:\) of round about 6,5 TB. This server is virtualized by VMware. We will migrate my old file server to Windows Server 2022. My question is :if I put in different VLANs for each file server , will there be any performance issues? 
 We have Checkpoint FW. Also , We have 10G network infrastructure. (Cisco Nexus Switch)

 I have one domain in the forest, and the domain currently has 4 Domain controllers. One DC is obviously holding the FSMO roles. I just noticed that the FSMO role holder is also a GC. Now in the past i've never paid any mind to this, and the domain seems fine... for years even. But Looking at the microsoft instructions for moving FSMO roles, they clearly state: "Do not put the infrastructure Master FSMO role on a GC".
 Why? My domain seems to be running fine. Whats the difference between a DC that is not a Global Catalog, and one that isnt? Can it still be used the same way?
 I only have one DC at this particular site, if i switch off GC, will everything still function correctly?(Auth, Kerberos, etc).
 ​
 My other Domain controllers are also Global catalogs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If there's a better subreddit for this let me know, but I'm having a lot of trouble and dealing with very poor documentation and hoping someone else has tried this. 
 I am primarily the video guy at an arts center, but since my venue went to NDI I have also become the defacto sysadmin for our dedicated video network. It's not fancy - we have a Netgear M4250 managed switch driving the network, and then a bunch of CAT6 run through the walls to our endpoints. I'm trying to add wireless for easier troubleshooting and access to the GUIs for my devices. I thought this would be easy (lol). That's the context, now here's the problem:
 I have installed the Ubiquiti Unifi Network application on my Windows 10 laptop, plugged both the laptop and the U6-LR into the switch (PoE+ capable), and am trying to "adopt" it to my Unifi network on the Windows app. That's what the documentation covers. However, the adoption always fails, then asks me to "enter the device credentials that were set on the previously installed location under network device ssh authentication." Except that I didn't set any of that - this thing is brand new out of the box. I press the "forget" button, which says "the device will be restored to facotry settings". That sounds like exactly what I need, but in practice it just starts this loop over again. Same if I hit the hardware reset button. Adoption failed.
 I'm stumped. Does anybody have any idea what I'm doing wrong?

 Clearly the messages are phishing. I’m wondering the best way we could handle these? I was thinking I just create a mail flow rule to say if anyone inside the organization receives a message with the body text matching what the custom NDR rule outputs to just drop the message.

What am I missing, and yes I did swap the tx and rx on the patch cable just in case it was crossed somewhere.

 There is a situation that has to be resolved:
 In AD there is a file server srv002 with shared folders Folder1, Folder2, etc.
 The server is running out of space. It was decided to add another server srv003 which has sufficient disk space and use DFS to 'distribute' data between the servers.
 The other intention is not to change paths to which users have got used.
 Is that all possible?
 I am testing with one of the shared folders that exists and cannot get the same namespace...

But god it feels so much longer than that. I'm also the only IT person at an organisation with ~250 people.
 A lot of people lack basic IT skills, which is totally fine, that's why we have IT people. Except they get so mad when I ask them to make sure their username/password is correct, or if their cable is in properly or if they're trying to log into the right platform. People don't understand resolving IT issues isn't always instantaneous and sometimes we need to wait for equipment to be delivered. It seems that I'm often expected to resolve everything Right Now and people get frustrated and upset when that doesn't happen. 
 It's a bit overwhelming to be honest, and I'm still trying to wrap my head around everything. I got 3 day of training before the last sysadmin left. I'm not sure how you guys deal with people who are rude/impatient/irritated. I also get frustrated at the bad communication and poor common sense. Anyone got any advice for this?

 I have a cheap dell t310 with hba sas card and 16gb ram with a zfs1 pool on n°4 sas HD 4tb 7200 rpm each without compression.
 I use proxmox on dell perc raid with 4ssd raid5 hardware managed, where I run some VM and container saved inside the SSD lvm raid and the zfs pool is only for my works files storage with samba with a 2gbps network bonding.
 Also I have an unused 4 old 10k sas disk of 250gb each.
 My question is: - the zfs1 pool has 3X read speed gain but no write speed gain.
 Want to have the sense to install one small sas 10k as a log disk for zfs to speed up write operations?
 If yes, I can work only with a LOG disk or if I add a log also I need to add a cache disk?

 I hope the hive mind has some input on this.
 We have a legacy application that uses SMBv1. We have recently stood up a new site in AD with a new domain controller. Devices in this site are unable to open the SMB share via \\hostname, but are able to connect via \\IP.-.add.ress.
 Wireshark shows me " KRB5KDC_ERR_ETYPE_NOSUPP ", but zero configuration changes between the devices in site A and site B. I've literally moved VM's from one site to another and have it work in A but not B).
 Site A:
  
DC running server 2019
 XP SMBv1 share
 Clients can connect to SMB share
  
Site B:
  
DC running server 2022
 clients cannot connect to SMB share
  
​
 As a test, I've associated the subnets of Site B with site A in AD sites & services. After a reboot, the devices are able to connect to the SMB share.
 So that leads me to believe there's an issue with the DC in site B, but I'm unsure what/where.
 ​
 Any tips would be very welcome!

 I am a junior Sysadmin for a NGO and we are planning to upgrade our network infrastructure.
 We are using D-Link managed switches (layer 3 functionallities for backbone, access layer 2, ..) and I was looking for good, sustainable alternatives. The D-Link swiches are doing their job but they aren´t that good to handle for my favour.
 While looking up some alternatives I´ve noticed that I dont know that much about the differences between switches from different manufactures.
 Since I´m rarely active in this Community I though I just ask you and maybe join the discussion.
 Maybe some of you could list their favourite piece of hardware they love working with and shortly state why? :)
 It would be nice to get some advice for middleclass price options aswell.

 The SOAR we are going to use is Shuffle.
 What can be achieved with those integrations and what are the differences? How do those systems work together in the SOC environment? 
 Are the cases updated automatically in TheHive with the information from MISP/Cortex or should they be configured to be updated automatically if certain conditions are matched with a SOAR?
 Is it a good practice to use both MISP and Cortex?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to enable ADFS on a vCenter but I get this error:
 “com.vmware.vcenter.trustmanagement.impl.InvalidArgumentException: java.io.IOException: Server returned HTTP response code: 503 for URL: http://localhost:1080/external-vecs/http1/XXX-XXX-adfsservername.XXX.local/443/adfs/.well-known/openid-configuration”
 I ensured that the ADFS is working via this (internal) link: https://xxxadfsservernamexxx.local/adfs/ls/idpinitiatedsignon.aspx
 I believe this is an issue with the certificate. That is because during trial and error I got different errors related with the certificate. Like: "Error occurred while adding trusted root certificates""com.vmware.vapi.std.errors.Error" "Certificate bearing subject""is not a valid CA certificate""Please retry with a valid certificate chain".
 We have a CA in the domain and newly created Windows 2022 ADFS server. 
 I have followed the steps in this link: https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/78029
 But there is no clear instructions on what certificate to export and import or how to generate one or whatsoever. I am missing this part. Do I need to get a certificate from ADFS server? From the CA server? What format? How to export? What is a chain? Any idea on how to handle this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, I will post this in the IT Careers subreddit as well, but I feel like this sub has helped me incredibly and I greatly respect the opinions of us folk who are in the trenches daily.
 I took a position as a entry level help desk technician at an MSP a few years ago with no experience. I was stagnant in my previous line of work and wanted to try something new (I’m in my mid 30s). In a few years, I’ve learned a LOT, obtained the triad of CompTIA certs, VMware cert, CCNA, and some Azure certs. I assist in managing our VIP clients, and have been promoted 4 times to get near the top of the food chain on the help desk (about 50 of us).
 I love the type of work I do and it just clicks for me, but a huge downside for me is OT. I understand there is OT for every position out there. That’s part and parcel of work. But the daily 1-3 hours (and weekends) of maintenance and troubleshooting the inevitable issues that arise from that work each night is just something I will not continue to do. Give me 40-42 hours a week. Take your money. I want the time off, away from the office. I’m not going to spend 12 hours a day working when I have a wife and 2 kids at home. It’s just too much, I’m burnt out quickly, and I can’t give my family my full, undivided attention they deserve on a daily basis.
 Are there any options out there for me that I can work my way to that is a more traditional “9-5” job in the IT world? When I’m done for the day, I want to leave my work at work. Obviously a sysadmin role at a company is out of the question. Am I more suited for a solutions role or pre sales? Sales? Account management? I’ve only been in the industry for 5 years so I’m fairly new to what options may even be available for me, if any. So I’m at the point where I need to decide if another career move may be needed. 
 Any advice at all would be appreciated!

 I don't need tons of features. Saving sessions would be enough. Doesn't even need Credential management, as that's done through ssh config and keys.
 Is there anything for windows that doesn't rely on putty?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! As the title suggests ive been tasked to look for a self-service tool that provides temporary local admin rights. Right now all of our users have local admin rights on their work devices which is a security risk we would like to mitigate.
 Points to consider are:
  
straight forward administration of the tool
 the tool should be easy to understand for the user
 there should be a way to evaluate who / when / how long someone requsted local admin rights
 it should be possible to determine the duration of the requested admin rights
 Company of about 200 - 300 users
 We are using Microsoft 365 E3
  
Questions we asked ourselves are:
  
Why do coworkers actually need local admin rights?
 can the tool / software be automatically be updated with our images without admin rights?
 can devicedrivers still be installed with manufacturer tools like Dell SupportAssist?
  
As it stands right now in my research on the subject i stumbled upon the tool EAM (Emergency Admin Manager) from dynasys, which looks kind of promising.
 I was curious if any of you have a useful suggestion or better solution to my problem at hand (im still fairly inexperienced and just started my first job)
 im grateful for any help, thank you very much!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all Got a call this morning from a prospective customer who is in pretty bad shape. 
 Ransomware'd, majority of data lost and no backups. They switched off all on-prem domain controllers soon as one of their techs noticed weird behaviour.
 Their only saving grace are two domain controllers running in Azure, showing no signs of infection and pretty segregated away from their on-premise environment and adequately backed up.
 I've been brought in as a secondary pair of eyes to relieve the pain on the lone tech on the ground.
 I'd be grateful if you could validate our approach below and any suggestions and pointers you could provide to work around any dangers you may see.
 Approach I'm thinking of taking is, once we're 100% the DCs in the cloud are unimpacted
  
Build clean network
 
Perform authoritative restore of the dc in the cloud into a new on-premise virtual machine
 
Install AD and configure roles onto the new VM
 
Restore system state data from the backup to new VM using Windows Backup Utility
 
Boot new VM into DRSM and run ntdsutil command to start Directory Services Utility
 
Use authoritative restore sub-command to mark relevant objects as authoritative
 
Commit, restart
 
Perform deep AD Health Check
 
 In terms of FSMO roles - unfortunately they were all on one of the on-prem domain controllers, now powered down - would this simply be a case of seizing the roles once I've configured the new on-prem DC properly?

 For reasons I won’t go into, I’m in a need to setup a M365 subscription (E3 Enterprise, likely with the security addons on later) pretty quickly for a business which will host ~1000 users. 
 For these subscriptions, I need to contact the Microsoft sales team. I’ve done this but they’ll take a few days to get back to me (which over Christmas will likely take a bit longer)
 https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/enterprise/e3?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab
 Are there any other ways of spinning up this tenant without engaging a human?
 I’ve noticed E3 Business subscriptions can be done directly from the portal. Can I just sign up for this and then upgrade? Or is this going to cause issues later?
 https://www.microsoft.com/en-au/microsoft-365/enterprise/office-365-e3?activetab=pivot%3aoverviewtab
 Any other options appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're a fairly small shop. Staffed mostly by young developers. We like to have fun when we can, in the past this was done by playing URT on slow days or before holidays. In the last two years there's been a lot of turnover and current folks just aren't into it damn kids.
 So after sneakily gathering intel for the last two months I've gathered that they ALL like to play minecraft. Surprise!
 So, tomorrow as a end of the year gift the company will be playing a Ya-dead-ya-dead minecraft game in a server I spent today building. We're confident most employees have already purchased the game but I've gotten an approved PO to purchase a personal copy for any employee who doesn't so they can join in, and it's theirs. Ties to their personal accounts. 
 I spent the day preparing a full java minecraft package, to deploy at 11:59pm tonight to all systems, and have a custom message that will be pushed at 10am directing users play some minecraft and join xyz server. 
 Once they join everyone will start at a specified point with some messages to read regarding the "game". They'll have the entier day to build the most elaborate home + an attempt to reach "the end". Most likely nobody will get there as its hardcore. Also, if you die you're dead. They've all been provided a named box with the same supplies to help them get started, food and a map.
 Its not much but I'm really happy I was able to get this approved and am able to give the company a few hours of fun before the holidays.
 Any ideas on change to the theme of the game for more fun? I thought YDYD would lead to good braging rights theme. We do have some sales, Admin, and HR folks but they're already all GONE for the holiday. It's literally just a bunch of very young devs and myself for tomorrow.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two servers with their own 10gb NICs installed and I'm trying to get an iperf test to make sure all looks good. The issue is that I can't make the connection. I'm using openmediavault as my server and in it I've configured the main port of each NIC with it's own IP.
 Server 1 NIC IP = 172.16.61.8 as a bridge, netmask 255.255.255.252
 Server 2 NIC IP = 172.16.61.9 as a bridge, netmask 255.255.255.252
 ​
 On server 1 I'm running this on iperf:
 iperf3 -s -B 172.16.61.9
 ​
 On server 2 as the client:
 iperf3 -c 172.16.61.9 -B 172.16.61.8
 ​
 But when I run this it just hangs for 2 minutes and then says 'iperf3: error - unable to send control message: Bad file descriptor'
 ​
 What am I missing here? I'm calling the IP for the server's 10gb nic and establishing my local server's 10Gb IP as well but just not making a connection

 I have a device connected to network 1 which uses mDNS for auto discovery. These network attached devices are only accessible by its software application. 
 I need to be able to VPN into network 1 and access the network devices via their software.
 What I’ve done so far; 
 I’ve got a L2TP vpn to work between the two and I see the device via IP. But can’t access the device since the proprietary software doesn’t see it. (mDNS / Bonjour doesn’t transfer over VPN)
 What are my options here ? How can I make it work. Do I need any specific hardware ?

 Some fiber links have a 60 KM SFP on one end and a 20 KM SFP on the other end. I'm not sure what issues this will cause either assuming all of the transmit and receive light levels are within spec.

 If this is not right, how do I turn them back to capwap AP's? The guide says to just issue ap-type capwap but that command isn't available. I also tried factory resetting but it keeps booting to the EWC partition.

OK. It's only been 2% for several years anyway. So not great. My reviews are exceeds to all of you managers. So I'm not just disgruntled. I'm pretty good at what I do. So what else is going to suck? We have to do after-hours support every three weeks for a full week. They are not going to pay us though. We have to volunteer. Now, in IT we've all canceled family vacations and lost money on plane tickets, yada yada.. It's not just happening to me personally, it's my team. My direct manager is great, and so is my IT director. They are very good human beings. I can't stress that enough. Mr. Rogers's territory nice. "Good people" if you're from the American Midwest. You know what that term means.
 I got a Teams call today from HR. I had used the F word in an email to my wife on 19 Dec 2023 at 0759 EST. I have a company phone and I had used a company phone to say the F-word in an email. OK fine. I violated company policy. I will endeavor to be mindful in the future when using my mobile phone, not to say the F-word or any other word that people find offensive. That list gets updated yearly. 
 I said to the HR rep " you called to chew me out about email usage, but a multi-billion dollar company is refusing to pay the IT department overtime when we actually work overtime? Can you see why I might be upset? You are not solving problems, you're just making problems up. You never just say thank you to us". The HR rep said, "Well, I guess you're thanked with a paycheck". 
 For the first time in 16.5 years, I started updating my resume. I can't continue to "volunteer".

 Example: I have a 200Mbps L2 circuit plugged in to a 1Gb port on an Arista switch. There's a bunch of output discards and I found myself wondering if it best practice (or would even make a difference) to shape the interface down to 200000Kbps. I attempted to do this as a test (rate shape 200000 kbps) and it didn't change the incrementing output discards (but I'm fairly certain I've still read this as best practice before).
 Any guidance on this one appreciated. Thank you!
 [EDIT]: I'm also (now) fairly certain my config was wrong as rate shape doesn't do anything without QoS queues defined, but I'm still curious about the best practice aspect. I believe this is how I'd do it on Arista (?): Rate Limit on Arista switch

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if this was posted already. Just got this e-mail from Rapid7:
 Beginning December 20, 2022, Rapid7 has responded to an increase in the number of Microsoft Exchange server compromises. The attacks appear to chain CVE-2022-41080 and CVE-2022-41082 together to bypass previously recommended URL rewrite mitigations that Microsoft provided for ProxyNotShell. Threat actors are using this to deploy ransomware. 
 Rapid7 recommends that organizations who have yet to install the Exchange update (KB5019758) from November 2022 should do so immediately and investigate systems for indicators of compromise. Do not rely on the rewrite mitigations for protection. 
 Customers already have coverage to assist in assessing exposure to and detecting exploitation of this threat: 
 ​
  
InsightVM and Nexpose: InsightVM and Nexpose added checks for CVE-2022-41080 and CVE-2022-41082 on November 8, 2022.
 InsightIDR: InsightIDR customers can look for the alerting of 8 rules listed in our blog post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this morning I was alerted by some users to a suspicious email. I figured it was yet another phish that made it through filters. But no.
 A worker for a state agency seeking child support from someone who MIGHT work/have worked for us was reaching out. Legitimate email. Now, did they send this to HR? Some high profile person in the company? No. Somehow they managed to figure out three of our internal distribution lists (likely more, but only those three accept email from outside the domain) and sent a blast out to all of them.
 This is already in "Oh hell no" territory. But it was worse. There was an attachment as well as the person's name. And the attachment, an OFFICIAL DOCUMENT, had the Name, Address, Family Members, and SSN of said person they were looking for. Sent to a distribution list with hundreds of recipients.
 HR notified, and well... I'd been putting off on learning how to mass delete things via Exchange powershell. Email is gone except for what's been saved as evidence, but that information was still accessible for several hours. To hundreds of people.
 In HR's hands now, and I really hope that state worker gets more than a slap on the wrist.
 Bless all of you who put tutorials online.

 I have something like this across 2 data centres (green is Site A, yellow is Site B): https://i.imgur.com/nKKrVnN.png . The 2x2 ToR switches are OS10, and I'm new to them. 
 Each site has its own edge so internet bound traffic is always directed from the 2 switches to their respective local firewall as their default g/w. 
 Is it then possible to configure the ToR switches to monitor an internet IP and if it is down, change their default gateway? 
 Take for instance the green side. I want 172.30.0.11 and 172.30.0.12 to monitor an internet ip (say 8.8.8.8), and if its unreachable, change its default gw to 172.30.0.4 ? 
 Thanks for any tips.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We had basically no spam filtering when I inherited my new role managing a company and their email was just a firestorm of spam and garbage.
 I enrolled the domain in a new spam filtering service (Antespam) which I've used many times in the past and love it and it offers users the ability to whitelist/manage their own spam and have great customer support.
 Not 3 days in and I'm already getting all kinds of push back from people whining that they don't want to have to babysit their email.
 I've tried telling them that checking the sidelined emails every day or at the beginning and end of each day here initially will give them the chance to add senders to their whitelist and as a result, legitimate emails getting sidelined will occur less frequently.
 "Thanks, I hate it."
 I implemented the filtering on Friday night and it's blocked 9 viruses, one spear phishing attempt and 91% of inbound mail was spam.
 The users heavily impacted by spam in the past are singing praises from the mountaintops (some would get anywhere from 50 to 100 spam mails per day) but those who got relatively no spam are up in arms that they didn't need it, want to opt out (you can't) and are seemingly trying to convince management that we don't need this.
 The CEO is on my side, agrees that it's best for our network safety and approved the move to the service. I am just trying to craft that diplomatic message to the nay sayers who maybe weren't really affected by spam before but now are having legit emails get put on the sideline and causing them to have to routinely go and check for mail sitting in the filter.

 A problem i cant wrap my head around arose. How can i just receive a signal from a CWDM4 transceiver?
 I have one pair that's linked between two routers, i've put an tap/splitter into the the lines, but i need to receive this signal. When hooking it up to the rx port of another CWDM4 transceiver all i get is a sad day :(
 ​
 Edit: Just to clarify i have the tx from each of the transceivers tapped, and im trying to input this into the rx of another cwdm4 to see what i am receiving. The problem is that i'm not getting anything from the transceiver even though i have great signal strength.
 ​
 Any tips for me?
 Eternal gratitude will be given to those who can help me.

 so i am new to this field and landed few months ago this "helpdesk" role but i am kinda a jack of all trades.
 I need to take on some security tasks, one of them is to split all the admin accounts to 2 accounts, 1 account to do admin stuff and 1 "normal" user account. (so for example, the IT personel now only uses 1 account for everything like normal desktop and mail work and also admin work). we want to split these into 2.
 I thought the best way to do this is to take a copy of the existing admin accounts and demote the existing admin account to an user account and the copy is the new admin account to do admin stuff. 
 Does any of you guys has experience with this? i am a bit stressed to operate this project. Any help is welcome.
 We are on a hybrid Microsoft environment.

 I have normal Windows 11 Pro machines at the office and I never have to log into MS to setup the wedget, as for the Windows Hello I haven't experienced it yet as the owners don't believe in laptops. LOL So this one is our first.

 Let's say my domain is domain.local and my domain controllers are DC-OLD and DC-NEW. I have promoted DC-NEW to be a Domain Controller and Demoted DC-OLD. When I look in my DNS I find:
 1) zone _msdcs.domain.local, this zone contains all records I expect, SRV records / _gc records / _ldap records etc.
 2) zone domain.local, this zone contains all servers / computers / etc.
 3) subzone, _msdcs under number 2. This is a DNS Delegate if I am right (grey icon). In this subzone I only find a NS record pointing to DC-OLD
 The NS record under 3 is not updated by the DC promotion and demotion (number 1 is updated correctly). Feels like it is not actively used in my situation, if I do a lookup to _msdcs.domain.local it will answer with information found in number 1. I think this is some sort of pointer solution used in ealier versions of Windows AD.
 What is the right thing to do? I can think of 2 scenario's:
 a) Replace the NS record of DC-OLD with DC-NEW
 b) Do not give it any attention, let it just like this
 I think scenario a is the best option. Is this correct and does it have any impact on my AD / DNS if I take this action?

 I have configured an M2 based Macbook for a remote user, and part of that is installing the DUO client. Whilst setting it up, everything worked well and Duo sent a push notification to approve the login.
 Now the user has it, the laptop is obviously not configured for their home wifi, so Duo complains that it can't do anything as it has no network connection. Putting the user in bypass mode makes no difference, as the client still can't connect to the Duo servers...
 Apple in their infinite wisdom doesn't allow you to connect to a wifi network from the login screen. Using the Option key to boot up and connect to a wifi network doesn't pass the connection through to the login screen either.
 I have sent the user a USB-C to LAN adapter which said it was plug and play on Macs, and although it works on their personal Dell laptop, it doesn't work on their company issued Mac. I don't know if this is because it doesn't work on M2 devices, or if the Mac needs to silently install something when it's connected, but because the laptop isn't logged in, it's not able to.
 I've ordered another adapter for the user which claims compatibility with M2 Macs, so I'm crossing fingers for that.
 The user is 2 1/2 hours drive away, so a visit is not really practical.
 Does anyone have any ideas on how I can best get this user up and running?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Problem: People are missing non-junk emails because they end up in the junk folder. Especially if they are auto-forwards from another domain.
 Ideally, we want nothing to go into the junk folder (unless on the block senders list). So everything goes to the inbox, notwithstanding malware and phishing. With everything going to Inbox, it would also be nice to get some indicator of junkiness as a MailTip on the message, but we'd settle for pre-pending the subject.
 Have a ticket open with Microsoft, and here's what we tried:
  
Change the anti-spam policy. Any actions that say 'send to junk folder' have been changed to prepend the subject with 'Possible spam'.
  
This doesn't really work. Yes, the subject is changed. But the email still ends up in the Junk folder. Maybe Outlook is doing this by examining the SCL. But there's also no way to turn off the junk filter in Outlook. Just in case, I checked the blocked domains/emails list, and it is empty.
  
Set up a transport rule to change all inbound mail to SCL -1. 
  
This works, but I don't like it because a) it doesn't prepend the subject, and b) it alters the SCL artificially, so by the time you get the message, you don't know what the original SCL was.
  
Adjust the rule to prepend a subject. Ended up pre-pending everything. So we adjusted the rule to only apply to inbound mail where the SCL was above 4. But then the rule seemed never to get applied.
  
Advice? (other than use a 3rd party product)

 I know you have to order the DNA licensing but don't have to renew it but what I can't see is if you don't renew are you then on a reduced bandwidth? 
 I need the C8500-8S4X to have 10Gb available throughput and looking at the license options it has the below: 
 DNA-P-T3-A-3Y = Cisco DNA Advantage On-Prem Lic 3Y - upto 10G (Aggr, 20G) 
 If I get this and it expires after 3 years will it then reduce the router down to it's base throughput whatever that may be? 
 Or am I looking at this wrong and the C8500 series isn't license locked anyway?

 I know this sounds unbelievable but whenever I try to run a non-powershell command in PowerShell in a GNU screen session, the terminal is getting stuck.
 I am able to reproduce this on my Ubuntu 20.04 server:
  
Open up a screen session by invoking screen
 Run a non-powershell command in PowerShell: pwsh -c "id -u"
  
This error occurs both when starting a screen session on my host, connect to my server via ssh and run pwsh -c "id -u" and when first connecting to my server, starting a screen session on my server and running pwsh -c "id -u".
 My current workaround is to instead run pwsh -c "{ commands }" | cat.
 Running pwsh -c "id -u" in a screen session on my host (i.e. without ever connecting to my server via ssh) works.
 Does this sound familiar to you? I'm very confused - it doesn't make any sense to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, 
 We have an small on-prem AD with 10 servers and 35-40 clients. Users are warehouse users working at packing stations on kiosks and the servers are controlling warehouse stuff + microsoft infra servers. 
 Now the wsus have stopped working. 
 ​
 Thinking with only 35-40 clients (servers are managed by Azure Update Automation which is not supported for Windows 10), wouldn't it be easier with updating against WU directly? 
 Bandwidth is not a problem. But we want maybe be able to do half of the workstations at the time if we get an bad update. 
 Whats your take? 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was configuring CA policies as a global admin and may have locked myself out. 
 I have hardware toke,password and authenticator for the account. I can sign in using one of the two(for admin)but it shows Verify your identity. My understanding is that additional verification is set to have 2 methods, verify using email and authenticator. 
 I was testing out authentication strength and enabled the highest one with hardware token or windows hello or business or Certificate for admins. I do have authenticator and if the prompt shows up(when I sign in to non admin stuff) it gets stuck on verify your identity because authentication strength for users was also enabled to passwordless. I do have that but I am not excluded from the policies. 
 I have already contacted Microsoft and they have arranged a call back but I was wondering if there is any solution. No glass break account available. If I click cancel, it shows account as signed in but. It goes to verify your identity when I click on it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Folks,
 I think MI Support is playing me here.
 We are currently running Core 11.5 and we usually use a policy to restrict iOS devices not up to date to connect to our Infra.
 Our current config is set to quarantine anything before iOS 16.1. With the arrival of 16.2 we wanted to update said config to 16.2 but it is not listed there.
 ​
 Mobile iRon is not telling me to update Core because only EPMM 11.8 will support iOS 16.2.
 They are sending me a bunch of kbase about Compatibility and according to said kBase even Core 11.7 would be not compatible with anything above iOS 15.5.
 ​
 Am i the only one having such problem with Ivanti/Mobile iRon ? 
 ​
 ( We could upgrade, but given the poor support, i'm not sure this would fix it. 
 We are on freeze due to year end, so that would anyway require a thousand approvals from the business.
 yes i have done the Device and Platform update manually ).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Might be a long shot with such a specific monitor/series of monitors but the issues we are experiencing are killing us and Dell are mostly denying there's anything wrong with their hardware.
 We have a few thousand of these in use. On the latest firmware (*08). Power Saving turned off. Dell laptops. Dell keyboards and mice. Dell everything. Some of the issues our user's get:
  
Loud screeching noise from the speakers begins randomly while user's are in Teams meetings. Monitor has to be power cycled to shut it up.
 
Various devices inside the dock will randomly not be passed to Windows (eg: ethernet, 2nd display (daisy chained)). Sometimes both displays show nothing but peripherals like keyboard and mouse work. Unplugging the USB-C cable and plugging in 3 to 20 times seems to resolve it until next time.
 
Slow detection/starting up of monitor/dock once USB-C cable is connected. Users say they "often" see it take a minute for the screens to display anything.
 
Arcing / crackling sound when the monitor is in standby and no laptop is connected. Power cycling stops the noise temporarily.
 
Microphone quality / audio issues during Teams meetings. I'm aware of the "double noise cancellation" issue that occurs when Teams is trying to reduce background noise and the monitor's microphone is trying to do the same, but come on, these are supposedly "Teams certified" devices. How is this conflict expected behaviour?

Boss allocated few licenses for 2016 and we still have issues - certain files won't open and network usage sharply increasing during opening that certain file, although, mail text is empty sometimes, some has crashed when setting up signatures.
 Switched from 2010x86 to 2016x64, clean install. Additionaly installed SAP and Oracle SmartView and updates. We were also trying to open a file without sap and sv, no change.
 That accounting department won't pay us for that switch lol. The funny thing is that this issue is only on new laptops company bought. Both new laptop and old pc has same os, same updates and same software with add-Ins, but laptop won't open docs that pc can.
 Reinstalling windows would be a nice idea tho. Still, this case has 33% chance after reinstalling windows.

 We have a new 1GB DIA circuit from Zayo in the datacenter we're colocating in. The datacenter tech ran a SMF jumper from the Zayo handoff to our cabinet where for the time being I have it going to a 1.25GB SPF module in an EdgeRouter X SFP.
 That's it. Simple and sweet, but I'm only getting aprx 150-180Mb down, 300-400Mb up speeds. That's testing from every major speed test website, as well as running Iperf to the public 10Gb servers. Also tried testing directly from the router itself using Ubiquiti's speed test built in UISP. Same every time.
 I tried both setting the router up as a L3 gateway, and as a L2 switch. Same results.
 Naturally Zayo refuses to even consider the problem may be on their end.
 Any suggestions?

 I noticed what I've done 3 hours later and immediately restored their deleted accounts in the Exchange "deleted users" recycle bin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[At one of our branch sites, for the past few days, users have been complaining about network connectivity being lost or crawling while attempting to access certain websites. During the time they say the issues are happening, no maintenance, or backups are occurring. Something tells me to check the routes on the customer edge router at the site and I see that all of iBGP learned routes are recently learned. Flapping has crossed my mind so I check the logs, and around the same time users “lose”connectivity to the sites, one can see BFD adjacencies going down between the CE spoke and a WAN reflector we have in another location. 
 Interestingly enough, the websites users are attempting to access are not suppose to be learned via iBGP. They are externally redistributed in EIGRP. During the issue, when checking the time of the EIGRP routes, they are days old. So how could users not have access to the sites? When you run a trace to the website during the issue, it makes it there. When you check the ISP vrf, the route to the PE is still there. No circuit issues are seen. 
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I am looking into start of authority and am curious about something.
 We have 5 Domain Controllers, 2 of which are having replication issues. DC1 is one with replication issues and also so happens to be the SOA for all DNS zones on all of the DCs.
 DC2 is a direct mirror of DC1, with the exception of ADFS, and so I thought "what if we made DC2 SOA for all the DNS zones across all DCs"
 If this change were to be made, what potential issues would you expect I run into?
 The reason this thought exists is due to replication being down on 2 DCs, we want to demote and repromote without DNS giving us an error, especially since we already tried this and we found out that it was due to SOA.
 Any insight into this or helpful suggestions, would be appreciated.
 **additional info*\*
 there is a bit of background missing here, most of which I do not have since I have only been in this position for 5 months.
 From what I can put together from various conversations the prior sys admins made undocumented changes to the DCs, which ive been working to understand,. its slow going.
 The issue we have is 4 of the 5 DCs have the same DNS forward/reverse zones and the 5th is minus a few the other 4 have.
 The replication issue came on roughly 2 months ago and only hit DC1 and DC5 with an error that states "sysvol inaccessible"
 We tried to demote DC1 and repromote it, but when we did we got an error stating the DNS server was not present even though the role existed. 
 One of our contractors helped look into this and determined it could possibly be a start of authority issue.
 I have never had to actually do this before in all my time in IT, so this is very much uncharted waters for me.

 Thank you

 I have a question in regard to setting up some filters on Juniper EX switches and I hope you can help me out with a sanity check and ideas on how to make my configuration better. Or if I am on the wrong path - set me towards the correct one.
 For the sake of this question, let's assume the following very simple topology:
 ​
 Juniper MX Edge ----> Juniper QFX Core ---> Juniper EX top-of-rack ---> Host1, Host2, Host3, HostX
 ​
 Each VLAN is up on the QFX Core and the EX TOR switches act as simple Layer2 devices only. Ideally, we want to keep this configuration like that and not bring VLANs up on the EX switches - only ACLs.
 ​
 Currently, each of the hosts connected to the TOR switches (in our case - dedicated server services) are in their own VLAN with a /30 of IPv4…]]></summary>

 I have an HCI cluster connected to two disparate switches. The NICs on the cluster are set to active-backup, so if the active fails for whatever reason it is supposed to switch to the backup.
 The two switches are directly connected via LAG/Trunk (LACP). The two switches are also connected to the core for user traffic.
 I'm trying to avoid potential issues with spanning-tree topology changes causing all of the ports to go into listening mode for 30 seconds, and crashing the whole cluster. I have implemented portfast/admin-edge on all ports connecting to the HCI, but I also want to enable it on the Trunk/LAG.
 I've been taught to never implement portfast on uplinks to other switches, so I'm afraid to pull the trigger on that last part. But I would think that the core uplink from the secondary would always be in a blocking state unless the primary core uplink goes down. Does that sound right? 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 Recently I was connecting 2 floors together with the exact same Cisco 9300s, running near the same SW Ver (One is running 17.03.04 the other 17.03.05). While connecting these two with SFP+, I put in the EXACT same SFP+ modules, and I couldn't get a connection, even though the switches saw them both. Both SFP+ were brand new. After much troubleshooting, I swapped one out with a different one, and viola, I got connection. Now here are the two SFP+ modules, and tell me how this is working, and why the exact two didn't. (I'm new to working with fiber, so please bear with me) 
 Floor 3: SFP-10G-BX ; 1330nm ; LC Connection
 Floor 2: SFP-10G-BX80 ; 1270nm ; LC Connection 
 I thought the wavelengths HAD to be the same on both ends? What's the deal? Also, this is a single wire, yellow cable, (SFP's are single too) which I believe to be single mode. Any insight would be appreciated!

 Anyone here able to give me an unbiased elevator-pitch like opinion on it? I have a server with openisp but postfix on it keeps giving me the odd grey hair, and it is overly complex to maintain IMO.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm wondering if anyone has any thoughts or experience here before I jump down this rabbit hole.
 I'm in a ~80 user environment that has on-prem AD (probably not going away) that's using ADConnect to sync users to the cloud and O365/Exchange Online (for many years). Exchange has never been installed in this environment, so there are no Exchange attributes in AD.
 I have a few items I'd like to tackle (mostly cleaning up the GAL (hiding on prem DLs, hiding certain users), ability to add additional addresses to users) that seem they would be easier if I had the Exchange Attributes in AD. My understanding is I can just run 
 XX:\Setup.exe /IAcceptExchangeServerLicenseTerms /PrepareSchema 
 and that will give me the attributes I need, not install Exchange and I can do basic management from ADSI. I know I'll need to refresh the schema in ADConnect, and I know that for "msExchHideFromAddressLists" to populate, "mailNickname" needs to be populated an unique.
 Here are a few questions I've come up with
  
Will this overwrite anything in the cloud and 'break' existing mailboxes (stuff like legacyExchangeDN or X500 addresses)
 Should I continue with the installation of Exchange server for management purposes? If I go this route, do I need to set up Hybrid Mode? Or is 'just installing' Exchange enough?
 Am I muddling my environment by adding Exchange? Should I instead take alternate routes to accomplish these goals? (like use msDS-CloudExtensionAttribute custom sync rules) For what it's worth, if I installed Exchange, my plan would be to have it on a server that's only booted when doing management tasks, but otherwise not powered on.
  
I'm wondering if anyone else has gone down this path before, and curious what you've seen... most of my worry is in overwriting something that was custom set on the cloud for a sync'd user, though I know most parameters must be sync'd from on-prem.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings,
 ​
 I am trying to write a batch file that goes through a text file and for each line of the text file runs psexec net user command.
 ​
 So far I have the following
 ​
 @echo off setlocal EnableDelayedExpansion :: Reset file Type Nul >"C:\outputfile.txt" for /F "delims=" %%a in (C:\ip_addresses) do ( set Var1=\\%%a psexec.exe VAR1 net user COMMANDS_HERE >NUL 2>&1 If !errorlevel! equ 0 ( echo %%a Account-Created echo %%a Account-Created>>"C:\create-account.txt" ) Else ( echo %%a Account-NOT-Created echo %%a Account-NOT-Created>>"C:\create-account.txt" ) ) pause 
 ​
 I am definitely getting the second part of the else statement because I can't figure out a way to add the "\\" to the %%a placeholder so that psexec executes on the target machine.
 ​
 I know the command I am running with psexec works without an issue as I have tested individually.
 ​
 I have to use this process or manually go and touch about 50+ machines ;-)
 ​
 I appreciate any input.
 ​
 Edit:
 Fixed formatting so my code was in code block format.
 ​
 Edit2:
 Powershell remote administration is not an option...I know, I would much rather use the fantastic tools supplied with Powershell.

In Mimecast the email bounces with an NDR 5.4.1 Recipient address rejected. At first I thought it was a problem with Mimecast but it seems this is the bounce you get when DBEB is rejecting the email. Now I didn't know much about it too be honest until the last few weeks. Microsoft support is useless. They just constantly refer me too their support page explaining DBEB. This user is replicated correctly within O365 from what I see, and our accepted domains are all set to authoritative. Besides that, I am convinced this support system sending these emails (amazonses) has the user on the account level suppression list due to the bounces, but I don't have access to this account to verify. Either way DBEB is the first barrier I need to make sure is not rejecting emails to valid addresses. Anyone have any ideas?

 I'm pretty unfamiliar with ACI/Dashboard, but they're pushing this because I wanted to use VDCs, and they're saying I can do the same thing but with 'slices'. 
 Additionally I can see us using VXLANs as well.
 WTF am I getting myself into? Managing Nexus at the cli is no problem for me, but selling my soul to a dashboard (one from Cisco at that) is something I'm wary about.
 Should I bail?

 I'm looking for the smallest footprint network monitoring and alerting software available. I need to install it in *NIX. All I need is icmp/TCP checks on around 20 remote devices, and then email alerts if those aren't responding after a certain amount of time.
 I don't need a web interface, or graphing, or historical data. I'd even prefer to avoid installing mysql or any DB if possible.
 Does anything like this exist? I've used LibreNMS/Zabbix/icinga2/etc in the past and they are fantastic, but they are overkill for the needs I have on my current project.
 Maybe my best option is to throw together a crude bash script?
 Thanks in advance for any ideas you can send my way!

 So my question is:
 Do I need an exchange online license and MDO licenses for each shared mailbox? Or is a MDO license enough?

Problem is it doesn't seem to work with M365. I've gone in one of our domains and changed the MX, then went into the verifiers and added one for M365 and authorized it with Microsoft but it won't test and it won't discover mailboxes. Tech support says to use the M365 verifier and RCPTTO for discovery but it doesn't work. And the error I'm getting on every single page of the website is a generic "an error occurred. If this continues contact the administrator" not anything like "failed to discover mailboxes" or "verification failed". It's like a web page error.
 Support has been no help at all. They keep saying the same thing about using the verifier and RCPTTO and that there's an issue with the testing. When I explain I've done that they ask another dumb question like "are the mailboxes not being created?" And then don't respond again. I've had pretty good luck with them up until now but I'm seeing the Rackspace fiasco all over again.
 Anyone have this working?

 Just checking the logon events in the security event log journal on one of my DC and i'm wondering if this is the expected behaviour that i have this:
 A Kerberos service ticket was requested.
 Account Information:
 Account Name: my domain administrator account (administrator@mydomain.whatever) Account Domain: my domain Logon GUID: xxxxxxx 
 Service Information:
 Service Name: a workstation from the domain$ Service ID: domain\\workstation$ 
 ​
 Network Information:
 Client Address: ::1 Client Port: 0 
 ​
 Additional Information:
 Ticket Options: 0x810000 Ticket Encryption Type: 0x12 Failure Code: 0x0 Transited Services: - 
 This event is generated every time access is requested to a resource such as a computer or a Windows service. The service name indicates the resource to which access was requested.
 This event can be correlated with Windows logon events by comparing the Logon GUID fields in each event. The logon event occurs on the machine that was accessed, which is often a different machine than the domain controller which issued the service ticket.
 Ticket options, encryption types, and failure codes are defined in RFC 4120.
 ​
 ​
 Do you guys think it's normal to see my administrator account requesting kerberos ticket?

TSB has been fined nearly £49m for an IT meltdown in 2018 that caused chaos and left its customers unable to access online accounts for several weeks.
  
 https://www.bbc.com/news/business-64036529
  
Full report:
  
This situation has all the hallmarks of business management strong-arming the IT organization into an unrealistic timeline. When business leaders push for overly-aggressive timelines, or regulators ask for multiple competing risk frameworks and excessive after-the-fact incident reporting, this all puts a strain on the delivery organization’s ability to untangle the complexity before ‘go live’.

We just got a new email spam firewall service and it’s taken a lot of constant attention to get back where our old service was. So I’m going through the message log and see an email to the Director of IT saying the main domain registration expired! 
 Call and Director of IT. Credit card applied. Swears didn’t get any other notifications - I can see 3 in the email firewall 🙄
 DNS NS record was only down a few hours and seems to be cached most places. 
 Technically I’m a consultant to a former employer (my choice). Just earned my fees for at least this month. 
 And figured out why I couldn’t sleep all night. Now to double check my backups.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 After 10 years, in march of next year our root vpn cert will expire. I was tasked with renewing the cert(s).
 We have a large volume of connected devices that sometimes can have a downtime of few weeks, so i need to think and implement a solution fast so it can propagate.
 The devices have various hardware and software configurations, from different time periods, so i want to make as minimal changes as possible (e.g. avoid redirecting to a different openvpn instance).
 My google-fu gave me one method - stacked certificates - also explained by hexonet on their blog: https://www.hexonet.net/blog/migrating-new-ca-for-openvpn , it seems that i could simply regenerate the client certs based on the new ca cert and swap them one by one without killing "old" access for not-yet patched cients.
 How would you approach it? There are milions of users so i would prefer to not introduce any significant downtime.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I'm writing this post to get some advice regarding a problem that is affecting the network of the company I work for.
 Our infrastructure consists of L2 devices (switches, radios etc) within it and is "delimited" by many L3 routers which are the edges of our unic large broadcast domain. Obviously there are several VLANs within it, but we have to propagate them over the backbone links, preventing us from segmenting the network.
 The problem is the following: every time we put a new PC on the network, it starts a NetBIOS boradcast storm that propagates to all our switches, causing us many problems. We have intercepted the packet with WireShark and we are certain that this is the problem, what we don't understand is why the packet continues to run even after disconnecting the offending PC. We have already taken steps to put in the broacast limits (storm constrain etc) but we would prefer to solve the problem at the source.
 Has anyone ever had a similar problem? Is there any way to prevent the storm, apart from disabling NetBIOS? Could this be due to a malware installed on one of our networked devices?
 Thanks to all those who will respond!

 Now what i would like to get is the connected server name, Local pc name, logged in user, windows build version of the client pc, and which groups/roles are added to the pc and logged in user.
 My current vbs script is visible here: https://pastebin.com/raw/iqnXY3VF
 I already searched on google but most of the things i could find are for local pc's.
 thanks everyone in advance

 I have a problematic that I'm not sure how to solve easily :
 Previously, we had some Office 16 licences and we used them on some PCs from our fleet. But they weren't many and we widely used LibreOffice instead. So when we wanted to install Office on a certain PC, we used a .exe and did a manual install.
 Today, we decided to switch to Office 2019 for all of our users, and with that comes a problem.
 I have to create a GPO which checks if Office 2016 is installed on a computer. If so, it should uninstall it and then install Office 2019 with our key.
 But I also have to make sure the PCs with Office 2007 are excluded from that GPO, since we still use that with some applications that require 2007 specifically.
 Do you think I can do that with only one Powershell script for example ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone use them? 
 We have them in several locations and I've recently taken the role as primary maintainer. What I've found is that they seem to be very buggy. They come with a process that will initiate a reboot when internet connectivity is lost but once in a while, they don't fully recover from the reboot. power cycling to reboot again doesn't work. 
 We also see an issue where the admin interface ssh daemon fails and you can't log in that way. webui still works. 
 Their support is... lacking to say the least.
 Their firmware path is questionable. 
 Multiple power cycling doesn't appear to help, only consoling in and rebooting that way allows it to properly shut down and restart.
 So it almost seems like our out of band management system needs an out of band management system.
 Anyone else have experience with Perle and maybe some hints?

 We're running through Cyber Essentials, and one of the passing criteria is to block models that no longer receive security updates from the manufacturer (eg Pixel 3a with Android 10) from accessing cloud resources (authenticating via Azure AD).
 How are people managing similar scenarios, it seems a bit over kill to force users to enforce users to use Edge and enroll into Intune to manage this.
 My thoughts turn to Conditional Access Policy, where for iPhone I could block by iOS version, but that's only shows a major version, ie iOS 16, not iOS 16.2. Android is even worse where it seems to just display Android
 Have others had to achieve the above and if so how are they tackling this? Is the only way by enrollment? I'm using a Microsoft 365 E5 license if that helps suggest options.
 ​
 Thanks in advance,

 I’ve been working as a sysadmin (linux, networking) and then a dev ops engineer (cloud stuff, some python for building tools and automation) for close to 10 years now. Started doing entry level stuff and then “senior” now according to my job title.
 However, one thing that has stayed consistent is that I’m always expected to do on-calls.
 Over the years, on-call has taken its toll on me. I lose weekends that could have been spent on hobbies, or with friends. I have chronic insomnia due to all irregular work hours and late night calls. In short, I constantly feel tired, lonely and mildly depressed.
 Asides from that, I enjoy the job and tinkering with the tech. I don’t think I am ready to leave this industry and do something completely different (like woodworking or something).
 From where I am, what are the possible jobs that I can transition into that doesn’t require on-calls?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 I was watching a video on switches that stated a switch can store MAC Addresses in it's CAM table after there has been an attempt to communicate from A to B and then a reply from B to A. That would store the MAC addresses of both A and B, but if this is the first time either of these are communicating on the switch I assume it would have to broadcast the entire message from A to B to all ports (similar to a hub) and listen for where the reply comes to map B to it's proper port. If that is true could that be a security risk? 
 My other thought is that it would just be one frame (since after first frame it would all be routed directly A to B) so it might not be a huge deal. All of this for the main question of is it possible to have the switch send essentially a "discovery" frame to every port and map the replies so that it wouldn't have to send an initial message to all ports. 
 I also think I may be overthinking a relatively miniscule detail but it just caught my attention and was curious. I appreciate anyone taking the time to read and reply!

 Long story short
  
There is an MBAM server (reporting doesn't work tho)
 There is a GPO with Bitlocker settings
 Wanted to move Bitlocker to SCCM 
 Log said on clients that policy did not apply, as the workload for Endpoint Protection was switched ot Pilot Intune (crap)
 Looked at MDM... literally nothing set - just enable bitlocker drive encription
 
  
At this stage keys still get to AD, but it seems that most of the GPO settings won't really apply (e.g. 256 bit cipher is set there, but checking on the client with manage-bde the cipher is 128 bit.
 I think literally the MDM setting takes over and it soley turns on bitlocker, but doesn't really configure it to our needs.
 I'd happily move the slider over back to ConfigMgr, but Endpoint Protection has a lot of other stuff, defender firewall and what not...
 The pilot collection is however a huge one. With 95%+ of our clients... bummer.
 I am crying... any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[From Ars
  
Researchers recently discovered a Windows code-execution vulnerability that has the potential to rival EternalBlue, the name of a different Windows security flaw used to detonate WannaCry, the ransomware that shut down computer networks across the world in 2017.
 Like EternalBlue, CVE-2022-37958, as the latest vulnerability is tracked, allows attackers to execute malicious code with no authentication required. Also, like EternalBlue, it’s wormable, meaning that a single exploit can trigger a chain reaction of self-replicating follow-on exploits on other vulnerable systems. The wormability of EternalBlue allowed WannaCry and several other attacks to spread across the world in a matter of minutes with no user interaction required.
 But unlike EternalBlue, which could be exploited when using only the SMB, or server message block, a protocol for file and printer sharing and similar network activities, this latest vulnerability is present in a much broader range of network protocols, giving attackers more flexibility than they had when exploiting the older vulnerability.
  
Good news:
  
One potentially mitigating factor is that a patch for CVE-2022-37958 has been available for three months. EternalBlue, by contrast, was initially exploited by the NSA as a zero-day.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 Context:
 I hack companies legally through called bug bounties. A few months ago, a Fortune 500 company gave me the opportunity to run phishing campaigns on their employees at a bug bounty event. 
 For some reason, they believed they were "unphishable" and offered a bounty for each employee I was able to phish. They were using Okta & Duo for MFA. 
 So, I bought a domain similar to theirs. I used Gophish & Mailgun to send an email, and Evilnginx to bypass MFA. I abused an XSS in one of their subdomains to redirect to a phishing page. Got 50+ pairs of credentials & Okta sessions, and full access to their AWS console within 2 minutes. I was blown away and terrified by how simple it was to compromise them. 
 Questions:
 I'm looking at how people are defending against phishing.
 From what I hear, Proofpoint and Mimecast don't stop most phishing emails. Security education can only be done so often and techniques are evolving.
 Vendor email compromise makes it even more difficult to prevent. 
 I know many people also run phishing simulations, but a recent study found "that embedded training during simulated phishing exercises, as commonly deployed in the industry today, does not make employees more resilient to phishing, but instead, it can have unexpected side effects that can make employees even more susceptible to phishing"
 You obviously can't expect everyone to be a tech expert and you can't expect email gateways to catch all phishing emails. If phishing simulations can have unexpected side effects, then what? Is trying to prevent phishing a hopeless pursuit?
 So, I'm curious:
  
How are you currently tackling phishing (including vendor email compromise)? 
 What providers do you use? (abnormalsecurity.com, inky.com, breachless.ai)?
 
 How often are you requiring security awareness training? With who & why them?
 How do you detect compromise? What do you do next?
  
Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all. I hope this is the right place to ask.
 I am developing what has turned into a small mmo. Every tick of the server sends an update packet for the actors to each connected client. There are other times a server will queue packets for other events to download partial compressed contents (zip) for the next area if the player does not have it. 
 The network code is very simple. We use UDP and have our own packet processor that handles queuing, waiting, sorting, chunking packets for various data-types types. 
 Lately more players are reporting a lag. The servers are taking longer to reply, some cannot start isolated P2P combat sessions when they could before, and so on. I have no expertise in this area except for the protocols I've read about and network architecture to for games. 
 Is it possible that ISP's are throttling unrecognized packet types? Since our packet structure is in-house, and each one varies, my hunch is the ISP is scrutinizing and scanning this traffic because it looks suspicious. I wonder if we wrap our packets in a well-known protocol like WebRTC for instance, if we'd get faster response times. 
 The code itself isn't the culprit because the players reporting the issues are using the latest client which has not changed in a year now. If it's possible the packets are being throttled, my next step will address that. But if it's not likely, then I will need to consider other factor causing online stability issues.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a question regarding single homed devices on a n9k vPC setup.
 Take for example a security server connected on the vPC primary n9k-1 on eth1/1. It has a single nic
 that terminates on a security VLAN on just that one switch. 
 If I leave all VLAN's trunked across the peer link then eth1/1 gets flagged as an orphan port. If I prune the security VLAN from the peer link then that flag is removed. 
 My question is...is there any downside to just leaving the VLAN on the peer link and having an orphan port? If the peer link goes down nothing would happen to an orphan port or non-orphan port by default and we want this port to stay up if the peer-link fails. If the entire switch fails then we would have to physically move the uplink to eth1/1 on the secondary so that traffic would leave out that path.
 Correct me if I am wrong, but I feel like the orphan port concept is more geared toward active/passive devices where you want to explicitly shut a port on a switch that has shut its vPC ports to prevent black holing of traffic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 My company has asked me to "Load balance the SSLVPN".
 Basically, we have two locations, Main and our Disaster Recovery location. Both of these locations run SonicWall setups with HA and Dual WAN failover. Both have SSLVPN enabled. We use Local + LDAP Auth & TOTP currently. We use Azure AD Connect to sync on prem AD to Azure. 
 The idea is this -
 If our Main site's SonicWall were to go down, the boss would like for users to be able to seamlessly connect to the disaster recovery site without needing to change binding/URLs.
 How it works now -
 If the Main SonicWall were to go down, users can type in the URL to the secondary (DR Site) SonicWall's VPN Office Portal. From here they can bind their TOTP, then log into NetExtender, change the "server" on Net Extender to the DR site's URL, and log in with their credentials using the DR sites 2FA token.
 How they want it to work - 
 Main SonicWall goes down, users go to the same URL and can use the same 2FA token to login. Users would not have to change the "Server" on Net Extender. 
 I'm planning on setting up Radius regardless, and I'm looking into alternatives like Azure AD 2FA with NPS, though I'm having a hard time finding articles/research to help me achieve what I need to accomplish here. Anyone able to offer suggestions/ link articles that could nudge me in the right direction? My experiencing with load balancing is not the best I'll admit.

We are looking to do an entire network refresh of our switches and access points in all of our plants, offices, and data center. Right now we have a hodge podge of manufacturers from all of our past acquisitions and we are finally moving forward with standardizing our network. We have met with a few vendors and done demos are looking to make our final decision on who to proceed with. 
 We're currently contemplating Cisco, Meraki, Fortinet, and Aruba. I'm attempting to make a list of items to evaluate and grade for each possible option and would love some of your feedback and ideas on what are some of your key features and criteria you'd look at when evaluating a new platform. Whoever we go with we will also purchase their NAC and that is a large consideration as well. Fortunately price isn't much of a deciding factor as we have excellent backing from upper leadership to move forward with this.
 Thank you all very much for any advice and input you have.
 tl;dr: What criteria should I consider when evaluating switch and AP vendors?

 But now I'm thinking, well what next? My company I work for deploys a reasonable mix of Cisco and Juniper (mainly Cisco) - so I'm trying to decide whether to go for JNCIP straight away, get a few extra JNCIA certs (Sec/Dev) OR.... start on Cisco and get the CCNA. Or something else entirely!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hey, how are you guys? i need advice for a network automation and cmdb architecture. we have a network which is until now manually managed without any kind of automation (>5k users, multiple sites, just ipv4). we use: 
  
hpe imc for switch management (VLANs, ports, configs)
 infoblox for dns/dhcp and ipam
 currently device42 as cmdb but are switching to i-doit
  
devices: 
  
firewalls are checkpoint devices
 switches and routers are mostly hpe cw7
 aps are aruba
 fortigates for site to site vpns
  
ticketing system: jiranow i have to provide accurate data for our new cmdb (we switch from dev42 to i-doit) and to create a network automation solution. 
  
how could a network automation architecture look like for networks like this in general? where should i start and how could a project plan look like?
 whats a simple nsot? should we use nautobot or use concepts like using git a data source (but how would you provide an API then)?
 how would you manage comware devices - open source solutions unfortunately lack support for comware compared to cisco/arista/juniper etc.
 whats your advice providing data from our devices and systems to i-doit? should we establish a nsot, aggregate data there and provide a single api to the cmdb? or a proxy script like netpalm? connecting the cmdb directly to the devices/systems? connecting the cmdb to hpe imc?
  
i would be thankful for any kind of advice!

 The circuit is giving off odd performance issues. A typical speedtest via Oookla I'll not be able to get more than aoud 600Mbps down, upload I can peg out to 950 / 980Mbps. This is with a laptop directly connected to the providers NTE. Other speedtest sites can be terrible. UKFast / librespeed for example I'll struggle to get 100Mbps in fact any speedtest site other than Ookla gives terrible results.
 I've logged a support ticket with the provider and we did some iPerf tests during a change window. iperf tests from an endpoint on their network saw roughly a Gb up/down. so their response was that the circuit is fine.
 For me that only proved the bandwidth between those two points on their network can transmit 1Gbps and that there's an issue elsewhere. I've been advised by the provider that this is an 'internet issue' and there's nothing they can do.
 We have multiple 1Gbps internet circuits from the same provider, and an identical test from an alternate circuit shows me getting the full 1Gbps up/down, that to me proves it's something on their network.
 What other tests can I perform to help build my case with the supplier?

 This is the year that I have blocked numerous people on phone call, WhatsApp and skype more than i have ever done in my life due to users trying to evade the helpdesk, or call me at odd hours or when I'm off work...
 For example, we all took a break from work 3 days ago for the Christmas holidays and we are resuming work in the 1st week of January but today alone I've received 6 phone calls and 2 messages from some users which I have obviously ignored, yesterday it was 2 phone calls and 1 email -the level of disrespect for my personal time off is huge huge huge
 it has gotten so bad that i no longer answer 90% of phone calls from numbers that i don't have saved in my contacts. If i receive a phone call from an unsaved number i ignore it and do a quick look-up to see if its some person from work, if it's not i answer i.e if they call back again or i will call the person
 next year im just gonna be ruthless and more strict with this thing. When i joined the org 3 years ago i thought some of the seniors are just grumpy fellows who dont like to instantly and joyfully help some users (not that they are always like that) but there would be instances where i thought a user was given a cold shoulder -but now i seem to start getting it

 What would be your ideal system of naming user accounts? Do you have please methods of dealing with this issue?
 Given that we've already issued many accounts which are basically just the person's name, do you have an original way of handling "john.smith2"?

 I'm not sure how to correctly ask this question, but here goes:
 I recently set up an Ubuntu server and shared a drive with Samba to my Macbook. I confirmed that it is working, however, I decided to change the user owner of the shared folder, now I'm unable to 'forget' the current network and re-add the drive with a different log in.
 I try to remove the credentials from the keychain and then do the Go > Connect to Server routine to get the share again, but when I try to import it, it doesn't ask for user or pass, it just automatically logs in as the previous credentials and they pop up again in the keychain.
 I hope this makes sense, could I please get some assistance with this?

 A few months ago I learned about autounattend, and made me an installation USB stick to use at the computer shop I work at. Recently my Home version of it broke, I made a new one, and put in the autounattend file from a backup. Now when we use it, it installs Windows Pro, so I doublechecked, and compared it to my Pro stick, and the generic key in the file is in fact for Home.
 Is there something else that could cause this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've stepped into a new role and have found a bit of a mess left behind by a previous administrator. 
 There is a group policy in place for our O365 that prevents older word files (I.E Word 95) from being opened. From what I understand, this Group Policy was implemented aprox 3 years ago. This is a very sensible Group Policy and I don't want to change it. 
 However, I've also discovered that there appears to be a raft of Word 95 documents still within the business. IT never converted the pre-existing Word 95 documents on our 8-or-so file servers. 
 It appears the plan to deal with this was to be 100% reactive. If a user cannot open a document, they raise a ticket and the HelpDesk would manually convert the file. I believe the idea was that the Word 95 files used within the business would eventually get converted this way and this will become a non-problem. But 3-years on, this still seems to drive calls to the HelpDesk.
 I'd rather pro-actively convert all our existing Word 95 files and call it a day. My problem is it's probably been a decade since I've needed to do a mass conversion of Word documents like this. And so far my Google-Fu has been failing me.
 Does anyone here have recent experience with a utility that'll scan a file server and convert old Word documents en-mass?

 ​
 How can i "upgrade" this Windows 10 ISO to Windows 11 so that each time i run it it installs Windows 11 -roughly 80% of our users were upgraded to Windows 11 on the new laptops acquired and should there be an issue that requires a windows reinstallation it would be a pain and great time consumer to start with that outdated ISO
 ​
 EDIT: I don't know the key for the Windows 10 ISO that we use, when I joined the organization I was handed the ISO file as part of work 'tools'. i don't deal with a key during or after installation

 documentation atm is a disaster, being spread across multiple OneNotes. I finally convinced management to invest in a good documentationplatform, and now I have to choose one.
 My first thought was confluence, but reading up on it I am starting to have second thoughts: slow, cluncky, atlassian, steep learning curve and what not,... I read some good things about Nuclino, but I was wondering what this sub have to say (about this or other platforms).
 I know confluence works together with Jira. We do some in-house development so Jira could be useful to us. But it's not like we are a codingshop that has multiple external clients that are in need of storyboards and such.
 requirements:
  
saas (yup, not even selfhosted on azure)
 kanban
 documentation
 some projectmanagement..
  
thx for the help!

 Pretty new to this and I'm searching for an easy way to backup up to 10TB of data for a mid sized company. Let's say I have this data on a server in some RAID. Is it still a viable way to do a full backup once a week to a seperate drive and store it off-site? Wouldn't this take forever? As of today the company uses SharePoint which is quite problematic because it works dynamically and messes with the data sometimes. I want to do a backup once a week and not everytime something is changed. This backup is just for the case the office burns down so the RAID is destroyed in its entirety.
 Thanks!

 I have a lot (~100k in last 24hrs) of events 4771, 4625 and 4776 mixed together, for only one machine account. The reasons is always "User logon with misspelled or bad password" or "This is either due to a bad username or authentication information".
 It is Windows 7 Pro, fully updated (with no possibility to upgrade to Win10 due to lack of compatibility of installed software).
 All our domain controllers have installed Oct 2022 cumulative udpate.
 Computer is available in domain, I haven't noticed any issues using it , everyone can log on it, GPO are working. First thought - it's Win7, maybe old kerberos encryption used, so I've checked if computer is using DES / RC4 encryption - seems like it's not.
 I cannot confirm if this issue existed before November patch, I've seen it few days ago. Shoud I be concerned? Any ideas?

 I will preface this by saying that i'm new to networking and dont have so many years under my belt (1 year alltogheter, 6 months technical support B2B, 6 months technical support B2C).
 I'm currently working with a customer who has issues with bandwitdh, it is a 1gig link. The customer has two routers from us that are configured with redundancy (VRRP). Recently we tried to configure another gateway on their equipment and we suddenly see a increase in bandwitdh.
 When the VRRP group address is configured on the interface to the customer they only manage to measure 50 down and 50 up, while if we change the IP to one of the available IP's in the range, for example the next IP, the customer suddenly measures 900/900..
 The issue only seems to persist on one of the VLANS that is configured, with a /29 net
 As long as they configure one of the other IP's in the range as their default gateway they have no problems, but if they use the VRRP IP the problem appear.
 My understanding is that for the failover to function properly the customer has to use the VRRP IP as their default gateway, or else the clients dont know where to send their packets if R1 fails.
 I would greatly appreciate any tips for this problems.
 Keep in mind that I am new to this so my explanation may be lacking.

 The equipment was strewn all over the desk. My coworker responded "I've already done it".

 ​
 I've been using Greenshot the screen capture program for years because unlike other programs I tried it was really simple and intuitive to use.
 ​
 For a couple months ago it's causing a problem of capturing my screen of the past; to be precise when I play borderless games and do a screen-capture, it captures the screen of my game when I last alt-tapped instead of my current screen.
 ​
 Is there a fix to this? Also are there any easy screen capture program not just trailered for streamers but for casual usage? It would be nice if it's simple to use for a layman and can capture videos too.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for a small fintect business (around 100 employees) as a data engineer. The majority of the company's key data is stored on a 1 TB prod Azure sql database (with matching dev and QA, and another smalled 300 GB SQL Server on-prem DB. A few analysts do power BI reporting off these data sources, and one of them connects to a pricing app our sales team uses. We are a microsoft shop basically.
 We are trying to implement true data management program, knowing that we have these needs but also wanting to cover some that we aren't even aware we need. We do know we want:
 - Data dictionary/catalog so analysts know what are the main tables that have the data they want power BI reports and our own compliance
 - Some way to assign data stewards who can keep the data catalog up to date
 - Ways to tag data as PHI, or what it's retention time is, to encourage privacy and retention compliance
 - Seeing lineage of our pipelines
 - Features that help consolidate records and the 'golden record' pursuit
 - In general anything helping us get to the goal of practicing data management.
 The obvious answer is Microsoft Purview, and it seems to click a lot of boxes and we are a microsoft shop, but I'm worried about the pricing. It seems like it could get expensive really quickly with the pay for use model, beyond any value it brings. We have a reasonable budget for data management but it's going to be hard to justify huge bills for what to most people will just be a data catalog.
 Other's I've looked at are data.world, altan, collibri, and alation. Then I see these open source versions with apache atlas or linkedin datahub and wonder if I should be going the free route and spin something entirely myself? I'm not trying to turn this into a sales post because I am skeptical of all of them despite knowing we need something :)
 Has anyone solved similar data management wants with any of these tools? Or have any general advice.

 I just want to know if this is common place or if maybe I'm just too distrustful and this is something genuine.

 It takes roughly 20 minutes for them to boot into the IOS XE CLI and start passing data. 
 I am just curious if that is normal, or if someone else has run into this, and found some adjustments that minimize the boot time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys. Got a strange one that I am struggling with. We have a setup where has a pretty recent workstation with an AMD Ryzen 7, 16GB RAM and an AMD Radeon Pro W5500 on Windows 11. The GPU as far as I can tell is the issue here, which is basically a cut down AMD RX 5700. When using the system normally, everything is fine, but when using it as an RDP host, connecting to it via a system with a Quadro K620 and a 4K monitor, it becomes a laggy mess.
 ​
 In group policy I have enabled the following:
 ​
 1 - Prioritize H.264/AVC 444 graphics mode for Remote Desktop Connections
 2 - Configure H.264/AVC hardware encoding for Remote Desktop Connections
 3 - Use Hardware Graphics adapters for all remote desktop services sessions
 ​
 I have this setup on another workstation that is currently using an old GTX 1080, and performance is excellent (I get random artifacting every once in a while, but overall it's usable). For testing purposes I installed this card into the test system, and performance improved considerably. When checking stats on hardware utilisation, the Nvidia card shows GPU encode activity, whilst the W5500 (and my RX 5700 from my home PC that I brought in for testing) never show any GPU encode activity.
 What is interesting is that the GPU has no problem encoding when using something like OBS.
 ​
 Any ideas what I can do here to improve RDP performance on a 4K monitor using an AMD GPU? Latest AMD drivers are currently installed. I would rather not have to replace the GPU if I could avoid it, it should have the ability to encode properly. Suggestions appreciated.

 I do quant related stuff and needed to build a basic web app for work. I made a short Python script, and used Streamlit to host it locally. It takes data from yahoo finance and does stuff with it. Nothing complicated. 
 It was working fine a week ago, but now when I run it, I get the following error (not verbatim but close):
 Cannot verify identity: self signed certificate in certificate chain
 The app loads (in Chrome) but throws this error along with others and doesn’t grab the data. 
 I’ve been trying to figure out the solution for probably 4 hours now and haven’t made any progress. I can’t continue the project until I solve this. It also doesn’t let me install packages. 
 If someone could hold my hand and walk me through this I would be immensely grateful. This shit is literally rocket science to me.
 I already asked in stackoverflow but nobody answered

 I asked it for a RESTful API to accept an incoming webhook, check the data for inclusion of a string, extract a network address from the data, and make another external API call to update a list.
 It gave me probably 80% of the structure right off the bat. Decided to do a flask server with python3, in development mode. I asked it to please have that run in production mode. Boom, updated script and instructions for installing gunicorn along with the recommendation of running a reverse proxy in front of it. Asked it for http basic auth, boom first try. Not difficult things to do, but certainly easier to just ask and verify the answer.
 It definitely isn't perfect and will confidently give you some BS. But it's remarkable how often just calling out the BS will make it reconsider, apologize, and then fix it.
 I'd say it took a 2 day project down to about 5 hours. 40-50% of the code was written by me in the end, but that's damn a damn good improvement for one tool.
 Apparently there are already vscode plugins for it.

From what I understand, HA syncs the config between the Fortigates so each Fortigate will have its own aggregate interface - it looks like when this was first configured it was thought that port 1 on each firewall would be a member of the single aggregate interface.

 I kind of like freshservice better between those two, but that’s only because we already live in the freshworks platform with freshdesk. 
 What you think? What y’all using? Please don’t recommend servicenow, lol. We just a two man IT team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I could've posted this in AITA (and even might still 'coz it's good content) but let's face it, no subreddit will understand this scenario better than this one. 
 School holidays are upon us and this means people are bringing kids (and ipads, and phones, and Nintendo Switches...) to work and demanding the WiFi so the kids have something to do all day. 
 Fair enough, I get it. We connect them to the guest WiFi, which is segmented from the network. Only problem (for them) is that the guest wifi is throttled at 5MBps and now the kids are complaining to their dads/mums/anyonewhowilllisten about how the WiFi sucks. This means their parents can't get any work done so they're complaining to me to "fix it" so Johnny can run his games/app/movie without disturbing them.
 I've explained that we throttle to protect the work connection but twice I've been told to "put them on the staff SSID". I've also explained the security risks associated with adding BYODs to the staff network and that this contravenes policy. 
 I'm not fearing an order to "connect them anyway" 'coz I have the autonomy/authority to reject that order but I am concerned about generating a hostile work environment. 
 I could increase the throttle to 10Mb. Short of that, any other ideas?

My terminology is not going to be right, so apologies. I am good with non business networking and wiring so I CAN understand.Can anyone theorize with me?
 This business is in what looks like condo's. They will get ATT Fiber coming in, and will get a router with that. Beyond that, I can do whatever, but there IS existing wiring to the walls, both upstairs and down, to ethernet jacks, carrying cat 6.
 The existing backbone is The panel, Existing, is a punchdown block, telephone style ish. I don't know the proper term. The ATT router will be left alone and installed as a stand alone piece, with wireless, but that's not sufficient for wireless for the whole place.
 SO....From the ATT router, I would like to have 2 switches come right off of that. THEN, I would like to terminate the cat 6 with rj45 ends, THEN plug those into one switch for the upstairs and one for the down. I can't see room to mount them, but It might be fine. There is NO give in the leftover from the block. THEN on each level, plug a wirless router into the switch to give better wireless.
 Beyond that, I am plugging 10-16 computers into each floor level at the wall, and one wired networked printer per level. I will manage the devices from the ATT router, but can do from each wireless router as well.
 I'm sure I'm not thinking of about 15 things.
 I'm trying to add a photo of the existing bloc, but this won't let me?? I am attempting to draw this up for my own concept understanding as well. It's going to take me a little while.
 Can anyone visualize this, and offer design advice? Am I at least on the right track?

 I hear horror stories about the big names like SAP and Oracle. I personally dislike Mircosoft, seeing as both Teams and Microsoft 11 are dogshit.
 The company where I currently work is in the midst of sacking up in order to move on from the truly hideous "ERP" system we currently use. I've posted about it before, but it's some partially-aborted, terribly maintained IBM AS/400 continuation. It contains our pricing, inventory, shipping, point of sale, manufacturing data, and lots of other info that I'm not currently privy to (working on it, but the disorganization of data is a whole other problem).
 I don't hate the Salesforce portion that our sales team uses, and I understand it has a fairly robust API ecosystem. 
 Does anyone have resources to research or any experience switching a(n) SME from a shit ERP to a less-shit one? The current solution is untenable, and our senior IT staff are getting quite senior. The underlying business (wholesale/distributing/manufacturing) is quite sound, so funding isn't as much of an issue. Buy-in from senior management/board of directors is the bigger problem (as always). 
 We are a 100-500 person company, NA-based USA HQ with ~10 locations in USA and Canada, and our aging workforce is a threat to irreparable loss of institutional knowledge.
 Thanks in advance for any help.
 Edit: Consensus opinion seems to be that ERPs are just shit. Which is what I feared. Time to get the checkbook out and pray. If anyone can DM me a recommendation to a decent ERP change consultant, that would be nice

Thanks 
 [As a side-note, I even didn't have enough clarity on what Bridge Domain is, why prefer one protocol over the other for underlay etc).

 The standard solution is O365, GSuit or something like Box.com. The problem is, management doesn’t like transferring business data over to these companies. Solutions where the data remains on premise are preferred. I understand! 
 Nextcloud is usually considered in these scenarios. I am not an expert. I have used nextcloud for personal use, and still learning it (eg, learning about different installation options). I also read a lot about it online. I personally like the software, but from my experience in the past years, I am a bit worried about updates getting broken between major versions, security vulnerabilities with a complex PHP app, and bugs impacting user experience. The web interface will remain open to LAN. 
 Do you have any experience with nextcloud in a small business scenario? How secure, robust and reliable is it, as a working replacement to something like Box.com?
 Anyone deploys nextcloud in production?
 On the other hand, I see governments in Germany and France and various institutions use it. I suppose they audited and vetted the code before adopting it. If it’s good for them, it might be good for small businesses too.

I have undertaken a project that requires data to be moved from multiple locations (let's say 10 for example) to a Central storage server. The problem is that none of the locations will be online, and cannot be online ever, so data must be moved physically by transporting the disks to the central location and unloading the data to the server.
 The satellite locations will have RAID-1 storage pools of 2 disks. Each location will have 4 pools. So in total we have 40 pools of 80 disks that need to be transported to another location, somehow mounted and have all their data copied over to the storage server.
 This will need to happen every month for a year.
 Have you ever done something like this? How would you approach it?

There's an online process and constant handshake that needs to be maintained and so my idea won't work. But this has opened up other ideas that are theoretically easier. Appreciate the responses!!
 ***Original
 If I am a complete idiot for this line of thinking please don't hesitate to let me know.
 I am currently running two identical separate networks (Main and Backup) each with only two machines on them - one "controller" and one "server". These networks are very static both logically and physically. Always the same computers.
 Everything is on the same subnet and the controllers can be any IP I want but the servers have to be the same IP. If they're not the same IP I have to do a ridiculous amount of reconfiguring every time I copy things from Main to Backup.
 Here's my question:
 Is there a way I can send the same TCP/IP to two identical networks or IP addresses?
 I was thinking about getting a 4-port mini PC and trying to use PureData to create a routing system and trying to use Mac addresses but maybe there's an easier way? Or maybe this won't ever work at all (because of what I say next)?
 I realize this is a situation that networking is generally designed to avoid but this isn't a typical data network - it's a live show TCP/IP based control network with no external connections and/or surprises. I'm hoping I can find a way to make this work!

 It's not ipv6 for sure. No pings back on that, or it's disabled.

 as the title said, I started working on a company half year ago. I am not 100% working for them but for a client. I don't received any call, and just 1-2 emails weekly and is for the whole company. They gave me a phone with a SIM. My original phone just broke and needed one. So that's why I ask that, if I use my personal SIM, can they spy my phone or just if I use the company sim?

 So we have applied for a Google cache.
 And at first they told us to wait two weeks. Then a month of silence. Then they told us to wait another month. They have stalled us for a total of 3 months now. And now they have finally given us a solid answer. Apparently they are 're-evaluating the entire Google cache program'. And that we will get a definitive answer by the end of the year 
 Anyone know what 're-evaluating the entire Google cache program' means for organisations that want to participate in it?

We ain’t that stupid to self-support it, so we applied for the renewal last week. We received a quote from the vendor and to our astonishment, it’s around 20% of what we paid initially. For just one year! 
 Question(s): What’s a typical price for the support contract? Should we expect extended hardware maintenance included? How is HCI different from SAN? In case we’ll decide to switch to HCI, which is another option we consider.

Its gotten out of hand and unbearable (just the damn glitching is one main reason). The reason is we have very specific things we need that google sheets does well, does anyone know a CRM that can do all of the below (we use freshdesk for CS already so covered there)
 ​
 1) Auto import orders as soon as they are made (hopefully every CRM)
 2) Attach photos to a specific order (be able to upload different images directly on a clients order that can be seen by employees)
 3) Have different bench marks employees can check off on each order (submitted to suppliers, order approved, declined)
 4) Be able to send emails for updates on a specific order (remind X employee to check this order again in 3 days, remind me to check for X in 5 days for this order)
 5) Easy to use and a design that will make all of the above easy to do
 ​
 if someone can recommend a CRM that can do this all I will be especially happy and maybe offer a small reward :) thanks everyone

While the team is hitting all the right notes (in fact exceeding expectations in some areas), I’m not sure I want it. I’m feeling burned out and the farther I get from ‘mashing the keys’ the more unhappy I seem to be. Has anyone else experienced this? I’ve just received an offer to go back to a more technical role and kind of feel a bit of the golden handcuffs as the offer is 20% less.

 I'm in a competition called CCDC (Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition), which puts you in a "Real" business, and has tasks(keeping a server and webpage up), patching your firewall, "setting up" printers, and other day to day stuff while under attack from Red Hats. All that just to say, I was looking for advice and help in finding services online/books that can assist me in preparing for this competition. 
 I've started doing some CTF stuff, learning from hackthebox academy, stack overflow, my team mates, and coaches.
 I personally will be monitoring the network(ports open, network traffic, services running, and firewalls) and any resources that covers that would be amazing. 
 Edit start: The OS is released a week before the start, but most the time it's a well known distribution of linux(normally ubuntu) and/or Windows Servers.
 This competition isn't until February, so I have a bit of time to learn!
 Edit end.
 Thanks!
 (sorry if this is the wrong group, real nervous to post anything online 0-0)

 Not a sysadmin, looking for some thoughts on a high quality kinda future proof, 10g switch for the following gear for mainly file sharing.
 - Up to 10 x 10g users (Mostly 10GBase-t because of short distance and our current NICs, I didn't know SFP runs cooler otherwise that'd been my choice for nics in the past, such as shame)
 - IXsystems All flash Truenas R20 with dual 10G Base_t (Once fully loaded can support more throughput and possibly can upgrade nics to dual 25g or more)
 Options:
  
S5860-20SQ (Seems packed with features, good price and expandability, I like how it has support for 25g and 40g which my truenas might need in the near future. But it needs transivers for my current RJ45 equipment)
 HPE Aruba Instant On 1960 12XGT (I guess software/support is better than FS, not sure? Has both copper and fiber)
 Cisco Business 350 (I didn't hear good things about it on reddit, seems like not really enterprise quality cisco)
 QNAP QSW-M1208-8C or similar. No comments, I have one and it worked well in a different gear. It's cheaper than the others but I don't want the cheapest now. I want the most reliable that has room for growth.
 CRS312-4C+8XG-RM Lots of great features and it's cheap but again cost is not my main concern

Like I told them 2 years ago they needed to get off this shit as it was showing issues, we couldn’t even get extended support, and everything else in shop is esx.
 We’ll I’m running in to an issue now that seems to be server 2008r2 + VMware tools related.
 On all these systems when installing vmwaretools 12.X+ everything seems to work, but if the server hasn’t been used in a bit it takes a moment for the network to “wake up”. What I mean is that if you log on to the console you’ll need to do a ping -t and let it fault for 10-15 times before it starts responding and then works fine from there on out. I tried the last supported version of tools I could find, 11.3, but this didn’t seem to rectify the issue.
 I’ve also made sure to remove the Nutanix guest tools and everything I could think of that might be interfering.
 I’m not seeing this behavior on why if the 2012R2, 2016, win10, etc…. VMs I’ve migrated. Just the 2008R2. 
 Anyone ran in to this before or have any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have some Cisco M5 servers that are running ESXi. These servers have 2 x X710 Dual Port NICs. We are noticing that in some of our load tests, we start seeing our dropped packets start to increment. When we dump the nic statistics in ESXi, we see Rx Missed counters are increasing. Someone told us that the Ring Buffers were dropping packets, and that the solution was to enable Receive Side Scaling (RSS). So we looked into that. 
 Inside of the ESXi operating system (VMWare proprietary Linux), the adaptors are using a driver named i40en. The driver is loaded as a kernel module. Per VMWare docs, enabling RSS involves passing parameters to the kernel module. We noticed there were two RSS Parameters (DRSS and RSS), which led us down a path of trying to figure out which one we needed to be configuring. We learned that there are two types of Receive Side Scaling: NetQ (RSS), and Default Queue RSS, the latter being newer. Since we didn't see any mention of DRSS in the Intel X710 documentation, we proceeded to set the RSS values to 4 queues per adaptor. We re-ran the test expecting a Eureka result, but nope - we still see the Rx Missed. 
 On this issue, we keep flapping between VMWare (who owns the OS), Cisco (who owns the server) and Intel (who makes the X710 adaptor). Can anyone shed any insight on this Rx Missed issue, and point us in a direction to go down that might fix this issue? We have to figure this out before we can allow a service to be rolled out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Okay so looking for a bit of advice here I've previously done roles where I was the sole IT support for the site, which was fine, I always was able to escalate if needed:
 Currently joined an international company where various IT roles are segmented, I'm (IT Ops) but we have a production network team, a internal network team, infra team, AD/Exchange team, even a procurement team all within IT. (When I joined I thought great!) 
 The issue I have is I'm currently running 3 projects which require communication accross multiple teams, and sometimes even simple tasks like shared mailbox setup take forever as they come to me first, and instead of just doing it.. I have to send it to the messaging team, then have no visibility of the case, so chasing up what I can't see for a relatively simple case becomes a headache. 
 On the other hand one of the other projects involves Setting up bespoke software (provided by the vendor) on a server provided by the production network team (None of whom are based in my country) and I cannot even install the software as their server is on their network, and their vlan that I have no access to, RDP copy paste is disabled etc 
 This meant I had to log a case with them to request them to open SMB traffic/share to our network so I can transfer the files. To which they said no. And then messaged my boss asking what was taking so long... 
 This isn't really a rant, some of the teams mentioned above are very helpful (rather some if their members are) and I have a good working relationship with them, however the above is a regular occurrence. 
 Basically I'm looking for advice on how other people manage this if they are in the same situation, or any tips, cheers in advance!

I finally have a working build with OSPF as the IGP and RSVP signaled LSPs connecting epipes into l2circuits. I found it strange that the official documentation on both sides said that it wasn’t possible it works just fine when you add proper compensation. I’m sure smarter people than myself have done it in the past but I’m very proud of my config. Anybody else ever deal with trying to merge entire networks like that.

 I really need to bump that up. They want $10 per mb for a 500mb line. 
 Is this really what this shit costs these days? 10 dollars per mb or $5,000 a month for a 500gb line? I feel IGF.

 Then I asked ChatGPT and... the answer was perfect.
 This is what I had after asking "How can I automatically set up out of office messages for disabled accounts in a specific OU ?" :
  # Replace "OU=Disabled Accounts,DC=contoso,DC=com" with the distinguished name of your OU $ou = "OU=Disabled Accounts,DC=contoso,DC=com" # Get a list of disabled accounts in the OU $disabledAccounts = Get-ADUser -Filter {Enabled -eq $False} -SearchBase $ou # Set the out-of-office message for each disabled account foreach ($account in $disabledAccounts) { Set-MailboxAutoReplyConfiguration -Identity $account.SamAccountName -AutoReplyState Enabled -ExternalMessage "I am currently out of the office and will not be able to respond to your message. I will get back to you as soon as possible." -InternalMessage "I am currently out of the office and will not be able to respond to your message. I will get back to you as soon as possible." } 
 Now, I know the tool isn't flawless, however, have you guys considered using it just like you do with Google to solve these kind of things ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been using Robocopy (RC) for many years... so long I don't want to say. That said, I am currently running a copy on a Windows 11 machine with its version of RC that comes preinstalled. I started noticing my /PURGE /NOCOPY options on batch command lines didn't seem to be working the same anymore. (subdirs were no longer being purged) So I added /S /E and it started copying zillions of files & directories instead of removing files. I verified there were a lot of new folders I did not want there, that weren't there prior to changing those parameters. I removed the /E and tested again, it looked like it was creating new directories, but when I looked at the destination it wasn't doing that anymore (like it think it should be working)
 I did see a blurb on the new Win11 RC version help page about them changing what happens on a certain system folder with /PURGE, but saw nothing about other changes to it.
 I did NOT go back and test older version, so maybe I only thought it was working and removing files from sub-folders if they weren't on the source. Don't know, and I won't invest any more time in that.
 So now with the added /S, but no /E its removing files/folders in sub-directories like I wanted/expected and not copying stuff.
 The /E option on that /PURGE line really screws the pooch! JFYI. -Bill

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 I was following come Cisco instructions to setup unified messaging to use OAuth2 authentication. Part of the process was to assign the Application Impersonation management role to the unified messaging services account. 
 I ran this command 
 New-ManagementRoleAssignment -Name: <RoleName> -Role:ApplicationImpersonation -User:' <Account> '
 After running, I ran a Get-ManagementRoleAssignment and I can see the role name and account, but under RoleAssigneeName and EffectiveUserName , I'm getting what looks like an object ID instead of what I was expecting to see...which was an email address. 
 I'm note sure if it was because I didn't use the quotes for the account...I used User: <Account>
 instead of User:' <Account> '
 I'm an extreme newbie when it comes to powershell so I've got the following questions:
  
Is this even a problem?
 is it the lack of quote marks that caused this?
 Are there commands I can run to change these to the email address?
  
Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 We at FilesNow are in the process of developing a new file sharing and storage service, and we're looking for some feedback and suggestions from the sysadmin community.
 What are some key features that you look for in a file sharing and storage service? In your experience, what has made a file sharing service stand out to you?
 We are aiming to create a service that is reliable, easy to use, and has good security features. Some other features that we're considering include the ability to share files with external collaborators, integration with other tools and platforms, and the ability to manage permissions and control access to files. Additionally, we want to offer robust file storage capabilities, including the ability to store and access large files, as well as support for various file formats.
 We'd love to get your thoughts on what features would be most useful for sysadmins and what would make our file sharing and storage service stand out in the market.
 Thanks in advance for your help!

 I've been working for 1 company for ~1,5 years by now. 6 months as anykey, 10 as system administrator. We have a small team of 3 people: me, lead system administrator and team leader. Company consist of 100 people in architecture department and about 100 in first-line tech support.
 Soo, I really like my job, my team have amasing chemistry, I can do almost all tasks independently, but I think that I'm sitting on the same place in terms of knowledge. All of our servers are almost 100% windows-based, and I do usually some simple things like managing users in AD, some share-server based stuff and of course managing problems with user's pc, but nothing extraordinary.
 And what I'm thinking that if I tried to switch a job now, I wouldn't pass an interview. I know how to do things but it is usually limited and on sense-based level rather solid knowledge.
 I'm feeling like I'm back on square one when I haven't got a job at all and I waster 1,5 years for nothing. 
 In advance I'll say that I try to learn new things of course, I try to make a note in Obsidian daily about networking and so on, but I can admit that I'm really not the brightest system administrator, so many things are quite hard for me.
 My question is it really I have imposter syndrome or is it a normal state? And, I know it is hard to give answer to that, what can I do to improve me so I can be valuable asset on a market?
 ​
 Many thanks in advance, and sorry for any possible language mistakes - I tried to catch them all, but who knows)

Most devices don't load at all. Just updated to v10 of firmware, was on v6. Further testing needed. Just curious if the community had input on this issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I have 1 firewall and 2 switches I have been working with. The firewall is pfsense and the 2 switches are a fortiswitch and a juniper ex. 
 I configured a trunk port from the fortiswitch to the pfsense firewall with native vlan 1 and allowed(tagged) vlan 20. This works as expected. I can still access the switch on the default network, and I can add vmware vms to vlan 20 and everything works as expected.
 However, I cannot replicate this on my Juniper. I attempted the same configuration (trunk port with native vlan 1 and tagged vlan 20) but when I do this I can no longer access the switch IP nor ping it (it doesnt appear to work on either 1 or 20). What am I missing that I need to configure for this to work on my Juniper? 
 Below is the output on the interface being used as the trunk.
 show interfaces mge-0/0/47.0 family ethernet-switching { interface-mode trunk; vlan { members [ 20 default ]; } native-vlan-id 1; storm-control default; }

While our IT department is a coworker and I + our boss who mainly does infrastructure, we are a company with a single office and about 160 people so until now we got by. Today the CEO dropped the bomb that we will expand from 1 to 3 offices over 12 months with around 40-50 new people for the new offices.
 My coworker and I are in the middle of organising and redesigning many processes and polices, together with a new infrastructure for a new software and implementing an intranet so 2023 was already packed. With the news we have to do the work that we planned on padding out over the year (also to be able to do our day to day tasks) in the next 4 months so we can develop solutions to our new issues with having more than 1 office (most of our infrastructure is in our local server rooms so we have to think if this will suffice).
 I am genuinely scared of the sudden rise in scope (neither our grown infrastructure nor our company policies and culture are, as of today, fit for the new environment), but also excited to not only execute the plan but also co-developing that plan

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I surprisingly couldn't find a script for this anywhere, so I wrote one myself.
 This script recursively converts all .rar and .zip archive files to the superior .7z format, set for highest compression.
  
Can specify formats to convert (in the VARIABLES section in the top of the script). Defaults are .rar and .zip
 
After each file is converted, the original archive is deleted, leaving only the new .7z archive
 
Logs by default to c:\logs\ (can be changed in the VARIABLES section)
 
Starts from the directory it was launched from and recurses down subdirectories from that point
 
 >> Script on Github <<
 I used this script to convert a lot of old log files we're required to keep around from Zip to 7-Zip, which saved ~380 GBs of space by the time it was done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I finally implemented MFA two weeks ago for our company after having a 'battle' with management for over two years. Everything went fine and already 95% of our users have set it up.
 This week I got a message when signing in to the Azure portal that there was a new conditional access policy created. I checked the CA policies and saw that a new 'Require MFA for admins' policy was created. In the logs it said this was done by an admin account of our MSP who does some support work for us.
 We didn't get noticed or gave the MSP an assignment to set this up. So I messaged our contact at the MSP and after some research from their side they say the CA policy was created automatically without their intervention.
 I can see clearly in the logs that their admin account created the CA policy but I'm not too experienced with Azure and CA policies. Is automatically creating a CA policy with MFA even possible in Azure AD?

 I understand that this greatly depends on size of the network, scalability, certification-requirements, etc. - but I want your input. I personally like using the firewall for a single pane-of-glass and ease-of-use.

 So - What do you think? Should L3 be managed on the firewall or at a core switch? Why? Change my mind!

Just wondering what kind of success/burn people have with them. To go with a <3K optic and it burn you and have to replace it with 80K optics is a pretty big gut punch. Even Cisco branded optics fail, so some failure doesn't scare me due to redundant links. I just don't want to be constantly swapping them either or worry about MTTF's lining up like you get with raid arrays.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So i have this topology in a mininet emulation:
 h1/h2 ---- s2 ---- s1 ---- s3 ---- h3/h4
 All links are restricted to 1Gbps.
 When i use iperf3 to send TCP traffic from h1 to h3, it gets close to that bw and everything seems fine. When i create two concurrent flows that go e.g. from h1 to h3 or both from h1 to h3 and from h1 to h4, the bandwidth they get also adds up to close to 1Gbps.
 However, when i concurrently have a flow running from h1 to h3 and one from h2 to h4, their summarized bandwidth is way worse and almost never exceeds 300 Mbps.
 There are some more retransmissions shown in iperf3 in this last scenario as well, but i don't really get why that is and i think that just the workings of congestion control causing a decrease of link utilization to below 30% seems unlikely.
 The retransmissions come in small bursts and those appear only every few seconds on average, which also seems too large of an in-between time to have me think that packet drops are causing this. This sounds more like timeouts, but then there should be quite some ACKs being dropped and why would that be?
 Cubic is configured on all end hosts. RTT measured by ping is mostly between 80 and 130 microseconds.
 Before i dig down further into the depths of congestion control (calculating timeouts and looking at whether the ACKs make it in time), i was wondering whether someone had any insights on whether that is normal behaviour or what else could be happening.
 Both memory and CPU utilization of any of the cores stay below 100%.

 Have you found this useful or not?
 Some people say their IP geolocation is wrong, but even if it’s not accurate, as long as it’s consistent, it could still be useful if you get a notification showing a login attempt from a new IP address in a completely different location.
 Some users may not like it even if it’s accurate because they will feel like their employer is tracking their movements.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are considering upgrading our small environment to 4x HP DL360's Gen10+, TrueNAS R10 storage array, and two 10 GigE core switches along with 3x 48-port POE+ switches with 10Gig uplinks to to the core switches. 
 Initial thought: Two Netgear M4300 with 12-port Copper (for the network traffic) and 12-port SFP+ DAC (for the storage traffic) but read that copper is hot and higher latency. So will get a switch with only SFP+ ports. DAC will be used in the server room and fiber to the 48-port switches that are through out the building.
 Does it make sense to just run a single SFP+ DAC from each server to each switch that will handle both network traffic and storage traffic or do I run two cables to each switch from each server and split the traffic? 
 I know Netgear is not enterprise grade hardware but $2,500 vs $12,000 for an Aruba 3810M seems like a major difference. Any vendors that are between the two as far as cost and feature set? For that price difference, I can have a spare Netgear on hand.
 For my DR site, I plan on having a duplicate TRUENAS R10 and 3x DL360's servers and nothing else. Can I eliminate the switches entirely and just run 3 DAC cables to the TrueNAS and plug the 3 servers directly into my two Fortinet 80F firewalls via GigE?
 Thanks

 I reached out to Threat Locker support to see about how to remove their product when tamper protection is enabled. They said it cannot be done. They provided me this link https://threatlocker.kb.help/uninstalling-the-threatlocker-agent/ however it doesn't help if you don't have access to the old MSP's portal to disable tamper protection. Has anyone run into this issue? Is there a way to boot into safe mode and rip this product out of the system and registry, offline if needed?

 They were big on team work, working together, and being able to think critically within a team environment. I then realized that I painted a picture that I do most of my work alone (which is mostly true) but I highlighted times in my past & current roles that I worked in a team setting so they understood that I can do the work but more than happy and ready to work with like-minded ppl and have that transfer of knowledge that I was not getting in my current role. I got that squared away and closed the interview feeling that I was able to convey "hey I can do the job and I miss working within a team environment with like-minded ppl and I am ready to learn and put in the work"
 I received my offer later that evening. They wanted to make sure I would fit well within the 9 person team and be willing to learn. 
 Thanks everyone who mentioned softskills are important. I am now a Network Administrator!

 I handle all of the IT infrastructure (End User Support, Sys Admin, Net Adm, etc.) and the current networking environment is running very old and EoL HP switches. I currently have a Fortigate 81f with HA installed with FortiManager. Along with that, we use FortiEMS and Forticlient for VPN, Anti-Virus, etc. I am considering the Fortiswitches. There is no inter VLAN happening, nothing layer 3, no PoE, just basic layer 2 routing. Keep in mind, this is for a small business, no larger than 60 employees. Would it be wise to switch to all Fortiswitches since I already have a Fortigate and Fortimanager? I had a demo and it was a huge difference compared to the current HP switches. 
 ​
 Has anyone used Fortiswtiches in a small business environment: no more than 10 switches. Are they reliable, dependable, or should I just stick with the big brands such as Cisco and Aruba? 
 Thanks for your feedback!

 We use O365 and I'm constantly struggling to keep up with the new features M$ decides we want. If something particularly useless or potentially confusing to users shows up I'll usually track down the GPO to disable it.
 Today a user came into my office to report a problem with her email reactions. I didn't know what she was talking about. She proceeded to show me that a couple weeks ago a new emoji button showed up alongside her Forward and Reply buttons in Outlook. I told her I'd look into it but that it sounds like a pointless new feature some people might have a little bit of fun with when it eventually rolls out to the rest of the company. 
 I could tell this response had more of an impact than the brush-off response I intended it to be - she then explained she had stopped sending replies to the majority of the emails she received from her team, opting to instead hit the 'Thumbs Up' emoji to indicate that their messages were seen and approved. I can only assume people thought they were being ignored. For weeks. 
 I also haven't been able to enable this feature on my own Client. I have Preview Mode on and am on the most up to date build.

 Currently, all of their data is in Dropbox. They are wanting to move from Dropbox to their new on-prem server because their Dropbox business account is getting pricey as they grow. Does Dropbox have any special migration tool like Sharepoint does or do I simply just download all of their data onto the server from Dropbox?
 I just did a few google searches and every article talks about moving from on-prem TO Dropbox.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Clarification: I know that pseudowire is a specific thing: a transparent, multipoint and redundant backhaul that encapsulates other protocols to allow them to operate as if they were on a native P2P network.
 In my long history, pseudowire has essentially been two things: MPLS MetroE/MAN/WAN to facilitate public IP circuit sales to end customers or intranet aggregation between multiple regional offices allowing communication between physical locations without logically going out to the public internet. 
 I've been reflexively using "pseudowire" when referring to SD-WAN type devices that do something similar with a standard public facing interface for public internet and a virtual/tunnel interface for intraoffice aggregation.
 When using this terminology with folks my age, they either understand what I mean or don't speak up to say they don't/ask for clarification/etc. However, recently had a conversation with some in their early 20's who had no idea of what I was talking about. 
 Wondering if pseudowire is just a "Oldman referring to Rust as BASIC" or if the advent of SD-WAN as a VPN appliance has deprecated the usage of that term.

 We have SP-A and SP-B, both of these are exact replicas of each other, using the same fibre cabling and SFP's, they are both configured the same to each other. However we are having issues with connections of SP-A. We are continually seeing the below error across SP-A. 
 "Lost access to volume 638f3632-e929b695-29a2-b49691e7e836 (VM Store 01) due to connectivity issues. Recovery attempt is in progress and outcome will be reported shortly.

 Target: 10.10.10.***
 esx.problem.vmfs.heartbeat.timedout"
 We are using Dell EMC and IBM switches - Dell EMC is hosting 3 EXSi hosts which all have difficulties with SP-A, however with SP-B they connect correctly

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll try keep this brief. My goal is to eventually become an SWE, and I've spent the last ~2 years self-teaching via Udemy courses, Harvard CS50, and other similar resources, learning Python, some JS, a very small amount of SQL.
 All of my professional work experience to date is in the automotive/customer service industry. The last several years I've been an automotive Service Advisor at a dealership in a wealthy area. I'm no stranger to difficult/entitled people and how to deal with them. I see this as one of my skill sets that may set me apart from others trying to enter the field. So with this in mind, I've shifted gears over the last several months a bit more toward the SysAdmin side to earn my A+ certification, and just this week I earned my Network+ and CIOS badges.
 My reasons for this are:
  
Develop some more foundational knowledge of how hardware/software/networking work because having a greater understanding of that can obviously be helpful.
 Have something concrete to put on my resume other than "I've been watching a lot of videos and practicing".
 As stated above, entering IT on the SysAdmin side may be a clearer path to getting into IT for me, given my background.
  
MAIN TLDR QUESTIONS;
  
Is it common for people hoping to become developers to enter via help desk or similar role, then transition to SWE? Or is it generally better to pick one patch and go all in?
 Should I go for my Security+ and get the "trifecta" before throwing applications out? This leads me to the next bullet point
 I'm supporting a family of 5, and my wife does not currently work because our children are still young and not all in school yet. I need to make $80k+ to be able to afford our monthly expenses. Is it feasible for someone without a degree to enter the field making that kind of money? I'm in central Maryland, so the median salary is certainly above average for the US.
  
Any and all advice appreciated. TIA

 I have to first press a certain key (it can be any key doesn't matter) 4 times
 then another key (again doesn't matter what key it is , it just have to be different from the first key pressed) 5 time
 then another key (again any other key but different then the other two) 1 time

 The HP appears to have the wrong driver listed next to its name (blue underline) - It's matching the Brother driver (red underline). Even if I remove the printer and readd it with a different version driver it still shows the 10.0.17xxx version which belongs to the Brother printer.
 I've searched forums etc but nothing appears to solve this issue. I have even extracted the working driver from my machine (I added it manually to test the correct driver) and 'replaced' it on the PRTServer. 
 Has anyone seen this before and if so, how did you resolve it?!

 I have always had the assumption that the younger crowd was better with newer tech, but may struggle with older systems. My generation (GenX) grew up building their own PCs and doing a ton of stuff "from scratch" like creating boot disks and having to actually install a TCP/IP stack. 
 Now though you can grab an iPhone or iPad and they just work for 90% of the things you want like email, web and messaging. If you're heavy into social media you may not even use a browser much as things like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram etc. all have apps.
 I supposed you could blame the fact that since these newer things work so well that skills like troubleshooting and figuring things out by building them have withered. 
 Anyone have any anecdotal takes on this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 Recently I've been tasked with enrolling bitlocker in our environment. As we don't have AAD and introducing MBAM did not seem to be worth the effort for our small scale environment, we decided to create just the policy and then activate encryption manually via script per workstation. It suits our needs as we slowly switching from old computer vendor hodgepodge to standardized modern enterprise Dell workstations. The policy was thoroughly tested and I've determined it works and is safe to use company wide, then GPO was applied "wide" on almost all workstation containers. I was 100% sure nothing will happen because everywhere i looked GPO managed bitlocker need a manual trigger of some sorts to encrypt the drive by design. Just one day after policy rollout we noticed some of our new Latitude 3420 we gave to the users earlier in the week have bitlocker encryption active. Good thing recovery keys are present in AD but loosing the control of the process is major concern. It's especially weird as it happen only to the latitude laptops. The optiplexes 3000 are behaving as expected. I've read about Dell OOBE bitlocker encryption but it shouldn't effect us as we reimage all computers straight out of the box using WDS. Investigation of windows events gave me nothing to hold on to. It seems like one time event per host because once decrypted it wont happen again. My hypothesis is that WSD <WillWipeDisk>true< is not clearing bitlocker partition containing some sort of residual Dell ransomware but it does not seem likely. 
 What are your thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey, I'm doing some work in really furstratingly secured environment and I'd like to know if it's possible to make a ssh tunnel through the following architecture:
 A Linux --rdp--> B Windows --ssh--> C Linux --ssh--> D Linux
 I control A (my PC) and D (bastion VM) Getting the Ops team to install anything on B or C will take weeks and I have work to do so can't really wait that long. 
 I'm not that comfortable with Windows so what I want to know is: is it even remotely possible to do a ssh tunnel through machine B even though I t doesn't have the ssh-server installed?
 And before someone answers: don't punch holes in your company's security - there's another company working on the same environment with much fewer security restrictions and I'm constantly getting complaints why are they doing things so much faster (idk Karen, maybe because they don't need 15 minutes to manually transfer artefacts through 3 jumphosts and can use rsync and other sane tools).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm a PKI administrator at a MSP and have to deal with certificates, CRLs and everything else on a daily basis (and 15+ years in experience). In order to take away the fear and insecurity of certificates from some of my colleagues, I would like to shoot a kind of promotion tour for certificates.
 However, in order to develop and create this, I first need to understand why many admins have a real fear of certificates. Is it because certificates have a defined expiration date, which cannot be jerked even in the event of a major disruption?
 Maybe you have some more ideas or can report from your daily admin life.

It's the CHADDR and source mac address. So, when clients' messages are received on untrusted ports, it checks if the CHADDR field and source mac address fields are same, if yes, forward, if not, deny. I came up only with this answer on https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/question/0D53i00000Kt7NhCAJ/dhcp-snooping-source-mac-address-vs-client-hardware-address but, didn't seem to understand profoundly. Could you, please, explain in a basic way the difference? Thanks in advance!

At that point, does host B also do its own ARP request before sending its ICMP reply? Or does it populate its ARP table based on the original ARP request from host A?
 I feel this is a simple question but im struggling to find a definitive answer.

 I've been in IT for 12 years, currently IT Manager/infrastructure engineer for a small business. The usual stuff from virtual servers, azure, AD, firewalls, iso27001 compliance, networking as well as a small amount of IT support.
 I've had a job offer with a considerable pay and perks bump (albeit current company have offered to match pay) to move into an auditor role, auditing a much bigger companies systems as part of a team. All around ISO27001. 
 Has anyone made the move? I'm aware it can be dry, but it seems less like people are going to be screaming at you when things go wrong which might be nice! I'd be interested to hear people's thoughts as I'm very much on the fence.

If the drives are in RAID 1 or higher and you have email alerts about drive failures and 3/2/1 backups, it seems like it would be a perfectly viable server storage solution for small and medium sized businesses, along with super high performance.
 If you buy on a sale, you can get an m2 2TB or 4TB for $100 and $250 respectively, whereas Dell charges over $1000 per 2TB SATA SSD.
 Has anyone here had a good experience installing MS Server to an array on an m2 raid card? If so, can you recommend any specific cards?

 We have a user with 3 PC’s, we use MS Authenticator for MFA/SSO.
 The feedback I’m hearing is that on one PC the user will check to not ask again for 30 days… then they’ll be in another location on PC 2 and attempt to access an app behind SSO and get promoted for MFA, they’ll say don’t ask again for 30 days…. Then further on PC 3… same thing.
 To confirm, this is the behavior we would expect, right?! The “don’t ask again for 30 days” is specific to the device that they made that action on… 
 Does anyone know a way to “sync” multiple devices to respect the MFA prompt? 
 I appreciate the feedback.

Got paid to actually work as helpdesk in the late 2000s, into MSP world shortly after, and have essentially bounced back and forth between Fortune 500 and MSP. I'm in the trenches. I've called the vendors. Fought the contractors. Managed the managers. Blah... blah.
 ​
 I'll probably get "Fuck AT&T" etched on my headstone. I struggle to think of two words I've put together more frequently. 
 Consumer wireless/internet/TV? Check. Fuck 'em. 
 Business DSL/UVerse/IPFlex/BVoIP? Check. Fuck 'em.
 It's not even necessarily the service. Or the price. Although both of those .... well, aren't the best.
 It's the support. I can't think of a more frustrating thing to do than to call AT&T because something is wrong. TODAY? 6 hours. Not done yet, either, but done for the day. I can't count the departments, personnel, time zones, cultures, and frustrations that I encountered along the way. The first call is never the right call, nor the second, rarely the third, and your chances of success only creep upwards from there.
 Man... Fuck AT&T.
 ​
 ​
 PS - if anybody got those good resources, whatever department, if you know a good number to get a specific thing done... maybe this rant turns into a saving grace. Maybe it's just another rant on the internet. Yes, it's short, far as rants go. I'm tired. I called AT&T today.

I know the economy is up in the air right now and I hear about layoffs, but not sure if that is a turn off for employers if you ask something about that. Since usually the first to enter are also the first to go when it comes to layoffs. 
 Just as a potential employee I would not want to get hired and then when the new year arrives get laid off.

Especially with how hard MS are pushing to kill IE once and for all and have everyone move onto Edge, to have no support for Edge for 9 months while the OS is supported seems really bizarre.
 If this is a Chromium thing that's out of MS's hands, I'd have thought they'd have enough clout to delay any underlying changes so they're not leaving this OS exposed like this?
 And yes, of course getting off 2012 R2 is the best option but not really the point of this.

 Obviously the configs will essentially be a copy/paste and what not, but how would you guys/gals go about cutting them over with the least amount of impact? 
 Since we’re utilizing vPC, could i just get vPC up and running on my new 3k’s and then cut over each port channel one link at a time? 
 Just wanted to get some thoughts/advice. 
 Much appreciated!

These past 6 months have been absolute torture. Our company fired 2 of our 4 techs in span of two months. Our client base has only gotten larger. Raises haven't been handed out. Me and my single other coworkers workload has gotten enormous to the point where we can barely function. We have both expressed our concerns to the owners but they seem to fall on deaf ears. I guess my question is, does it ever get better? The Stress? The anger and frustration? Anyone have any suggestions on how they dcompress? This job has all but ruined technology for me. The main reason I originally went into IT was because I just love the satisfaction of fixing something that is broken, especially in tech. But that passion is gone. I know I haven't been in the game that long so I don't want to write off the industry as a whole, but I'm genuinely gonna lose it. 
 Sorry for the rant everyone!

 Some Background:
 Around 6 months ago, I went from being a Level II Service Desk Analyst to an IT Manager for a small business aerospace company (less than 50 employees). Won't lie to you, no clue how I got the job, guess they liked my soft skills. Applied cause the company name was cool, I'm deep in it now and I'm ready to gain some crazy experience.
 This was a brand new position as they are trying to move away from MSP IT to Internal IT. As of right now, I am the IT Department.
 The first few months I was understanding the layout of their network and understanding their immediate needs. I've finally gotten their top priority needs out of the way and now I can work on the nitty gritty.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I have an issue that has been a complete PITA to troubleshoot and resolve.
 Infrastructure backstory:
 Core device is a fiber aggregation switch stack (2x Cisco C3850-12XS) that all MDF and IDFs connect to over LACP port channels (Fiber Sw 1 <> M/IDF Sw 1, Fiber Sw 2 <> M/IDF Sw 2).
 Wireless is handled by cloud management, no on-prem controller.
 Issue:
 Generally excessive amount of %SW_MATM-4-MACFLAP_NOTIF logs popping up in the fiber switch. Switch 2 interface for Port-Channel 5 and 6 have repeated state changes and appears to be related. The state change doesn't happen at the same time and is not consistent but does happen almost daily. Also, only the fiber switch side's interface is having this state change.
 Troubleshooting:
 Both fiber switches have been rebooted.
 Swapped the SFP modules from Sw 1 to Sw 2 and vice versa. State change issue remained on Sw 2.
 Only thing I haven't done yet was to move the SFP modules to completely new ports as this is remote site and I'm waiting on an onsite visit to get that accomplished.
 I am aware of the "why" this is happening, insofar as the MAC flaps caused by the end users roaming between APs that are on different switches, so it sees the MAC twice. What I'm perplexed on is why it's causing a couple interfaces to constantly drop. The drop is not causing noticeable issues and doesn't bring down the port-channel, just constantly state changing.

 Yes, I know they are EoL. Yes, I know the ports are oversubscribed. I'm fine even with the 6 Gbps per slot bandwidth of classic modules. Yes, I know they are power hogs.
 That being said, if I load a switch up with 384 SFP ports, it looks like it will only use about 1 KW of power. That isn't totally unreasonable. It's less than 3 W per port.
 Feel free to check my math:
  
redundant supervisors and chassis 554 W
 
8 x WS-X4448-GB-SFP @ 65 W each totalling 520 W
 
 Grand total 1074 W / 384 ports = 2,8 W per port
 So, what do y'all say? Yay or nay?

 The URL to their website is in the body.
  
The problem is even when you look at the Office 365 data it shows that DMARC and SPF passed AND that the URL in the body was not a threat.
 I have literally no data telling me why it was quarantined. We opened a ticket with Microsoft and it basically went nowhere. They wanted us to add it to the allow list in the account we were using for testing and they couldn't comprehend the bigger picture that this is a problem for anyone on Office 365 that they send to.
 What can we do in this situation? Microsoft's own portal says the URL is not a threat, we even checked the sending IP's, the smart host IP's and the website for blacklists (there were none). Has anyone been in this situation?

I have contacted a few users of various technical proficiency to test out the instructions I have written up for them (a lot of older, computer-illiterate folks) and one thing I didn't anticipate (although I should have) is that quite a few folks were hesitant to download the MS Authenticator app, with some even outright refusing. Not everyone has a smart phone issued to them so we are still offering the option to authenticate with SMS. It's not ideal, but better than nothing. 
 Other than reiterating that the app does not collect personal information and does not open your personal device up for FOIA requests, is there anything I can tell people to give them peace of mind when we start migrating entire departments to MFA? I have spoken with department heads and our city manager about the potential for unrest over this, but is it just a case of telling people to suck it up and do it or you won't have access to your account? I want to be as accommodating as possible (within reason) but I don't want to stir the pot and have people think we are putting spyware on their personal phones.
 Anyone dealt with folks like this before?

 im wondering if on juniper this is the best method for bandwidth across the two suites.. we are getting terrible connectivity issues in the new suite with about 300 clients. 10gig fiber is ran from suite to suite.

 I'm looking for a network switch that is at maximum 6" deep and can be rack mounted. I don't need a lot of ports, 12 would be lots. I'm dealing with an old install where the patch panel is mounted to a 6" deep 4U wall mount. I'm having problems finding anything like this. Most of them are the full depth switches.
 Thanks for the help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a user account hacked in 365 yesterday. Didn't know until I got an email that the user was blocked for spamming. From looking at the logs, I can see the login attempt from a remote location and a Authenticator MFA notification was approved. The user tells me that they didn't receive or approve any notifications. I tend to believe them since we have the numbers matching and location based settings turned on for Authenticator and I would think they would remember typing in the numbers.
 The strange thing I noticed is that the audit logs show a change in authentication methods at the time of the login. An iPhone was mysteriously added as an authentication method on the account.
 Has anyone seen behavior like this before?
 Update: After reviewing logs it looks like credentials were phished then an MFA approval by the user. I don’t think their lying, they just didn’t even realize they were phished. This created a mess because the attacker sent out 100’s of emails from the account. Thanks for all the info and suggestions that have been mentioned.

 Unsolicited b2b spam (the "I'm circling back at the risk of being a lingering annoyance" messages) really, really frustrate me for a number of reasons, chief among them though:
  
dozens to hundreds a day; and,
 it pisses off employees if/when certain ones make it through routinely (think specific senders or domains) and then I have to hear about it.
  
My solution... every one of these messages I see entering our mail system, I add the sending domain (not the senders address) to an auto-reject list. If they have multiple domains associated with them that I can find, I block those, too.
 The other day I have this b2b rep contact me because they've discovered my game (+1 for your tenacity in actually figuring out what I'm actually doing, but I'm not unblocking your domain), and I get this ugly email about how I'm being unfair, depriving them of income opportunities, yadda, yadda, yadda. 
 So here's the question ... am I actually being unfair? How in the world is anybody supposed to combat the sheer, unrelenting torrent of daily b2b spam? 
 If anybody else has a better or less predictable way of "terminating" these emails, I'm all ears.

 ​
 I'm getting the two windows errors 10048 and 10055 on Windows 10 after a short while of runtime indicating that the listening address is already in use or no more sockets are available.
 ​
 I tried the following solution found on the Net: Increasing MaxUserPort under: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters
 But that doesn't help.
 ​
 Also listing the opened Ports via netstat -a -b or tcpview.exe and trying to kill suspicious processes does not help. I have killed dozens of processes, but nothing helps and I failed to identify a bad process.
 Also there are not too many open listening sockets less than 50 maybe, so there is no way that the number of allowed sockets is maxed out. But still the system won't allow me to listen to any new socket, or any random port claiming that the address or socket is already in use or no buffer space is available to open any new connections.
 ​
 Only thing that helps is to restart the system and wait for the problem to occur again, which can happen within an hour or maybe work several hours for the error to occur.
 ​
 I'm out of ideas. The system was running fine for months and now this problem is bugging me since a few weeks without finding a solution that avoids a restart.
 Anyone has experience with these errors and has any suggestions beyond what I have already tried and mentioned above?
 The system is an I7 11th gen with 64GB of RAM running updated Windows 10.
 Thanks for the Help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a rule 6 / educational post (request).
 I live in Israel.
 Despite the country's reputation as being relatively advanced in technology, fiber optic has only begun getting rolled out here - on a largescale basis - over the past few years. 
 An awful lot of the rest of the network is still connected through vDSL and coaxial.
 I've been trying to make sense of how the various ISPs / infrastructure owners have been laying fiber in my city. 
 It took the best part of two years to finally become available at my building. And when it finally did, it seemed as if every fiber network (there are, I believe, at least 3) was hooked up.
 I know that the internet backbone is built on fiber and that the other inferior forms of connectivity are really used only for last mile stuff to bring internet to consumers.
 I guess what I'm curious to know is what kind of factors make it difficult and time consuming to go from getting fiber from a junction box to the point of being able to finally connect a building and then dwelling units.
 Liaising with other infrastructure providers? Waiting for permits from municipalities to dig up roads to lay cable? Lots of difficult splicing work that has to be carried out in the field?
 How does it happen, exactly, and why does it seem to be a long and cumbersome process?

 When he created the local AD account, it created a new user and never synced with the original account? The root of the issue is we use the Company Name field for a dynamic group in Azure for email. 
 However, this users company name is different in AD then it is in Azure (from his previous role). His email and everything loads with no issues with his previous inbox. I thought of using power show and the Set-AzureADUserExtension cmdlet, but it won’t allow me because it’s originated on an on-prem AD.

 "Ok, uhhh... What network cabling is being replaced and is any equipment changing or is it strictly just the Ethernet or fiber cables?" I ask, as knowing the IPs are set up for the necessary devices will determine how long today is gonna be for me.

 I come from BSD world where solution to the problem is rather simple. Socket flag SO_REUSEPORT_LB allows multiple OpenVPN processes to connect to a single socket that performs UDP load balancing.
 Linux only comes with SO_REUSEPORT (without LB part). I had tried to think of a way to run multiple OpenVPN processes and came up with this
  
UDP proxy on a host (ha-proxy/nginx)
 OpenVPN processes in a container behind UDP proxy
 Each container peers with the host and announces its tun* interface (BGP, OSPF whatever. Or even a bunch of static routes on the host)
  
Looks like a lot of overhead. So how do you Linux guys scale OpenVPN?

 I have been tasked with the great opportunity to destroy the data on 720 HDDs. I know. It's really cool ...
 I need to figure out a way to do it fast and secure. 
 In the past I have been using DBAN, but I need to figure out a solution to do batches of 10 or even more HDDs at once. 
 Any ideas what hardware is needed to achieve something like that? 
 The HDDs need to be reused, so it's just destroying the data on the drives that's needed and not the drive itself. 
 ​
 Any suggestions or experience with such a task is welcome.

 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm exploring different solutions for application patching on Windows endpoints (around 300 right now, different locations). My aim being:
 * Easy to deploy and manage * Unattended, low maintenance * 100% cloud based * Cover already installed software, not only new deployments * Focus on low priority apps, like 7zip or web browsers. Business critical software is managed via Intune, will stay this way.
 PDQ Deploy and alike won't really work due to cloud requirement. I also don't want to rely on Intune for every app, updating it manually. I don't have the manpower at the moment. This is a one man department with MSP support. I need this to be smart and automated, while keeping it inhouse within my control. Something I can setup and let it do the work, like with Lenovo Commercial Vantage for firmware and driver updates on our fleet of devices.
 I'm looking into winget right now, specifically this spin on it: Winget AutoUpdate - WAU and I really like it so far, testing in the lab. Of course I know it won't cover 100% of my inventory, but it works really well for what it is. About to launch small pilot with 10 users.
 I'd love to hear about your experiences, some success stories (if any!). Have you tried similar approaches, be it Winget or Chocolatey? Do you maintain your own repos, deploy software this way?

 I had a look at the mail headers and believe this is due to our mail going out to a signature server, applying a signature and returning before being sent to its intended destination. This is set up in O365 via connectors and has an appropriate SPF record in our DNS.
 Could this be giving a false positive and passing on DMARC? In the header details, Authentication-Results comes back as a spf=pass, dkim=none, dmarc=pass but this is with the IP of our signature server so that is good because we want that to pass. Whereas Authentication-Results-Original returns a failure: spf=fail, dkim=none, dmarc=fail.
 Has anyone experienced this before and do you have any advice in how to combat this? Given that Authentication-Results-Original gives the result I would expect is the signature server causing this issue?

 I was wondering what other people's experiences were with the current Anti Virus solutions? if it was just up to us(at the IT) we would just depend on the tools we have now in defender and such, but thats not going to be good enough with 90 to 100 teachers walking around.
 ​
 some small tidbits of info
 - we currently have about 180 endpoint clients running
 - we are only paying 8 $ per user per year with Kaspersky, which is dirt cheap.
 - we are currently using a google workspace environment but we are planning on migrating to a microsoft azure environment
 - we are located in Europe. I dont think that matters much but I have read some different experiences between certain solutions between regions.

 I'm still new with all the SAML/SSO stuff.
 We have an app that connects to an IdP. The IdP requires the SP Metadata to have an entity ID in URI. Everything works well with this setup. I can see in the AuthnRequest that the Issuer is in URI.
 Now, we've been trying to put AWS Cognito or Auth0 between the web app and the IdP.
 The problem is, the IdP that we're using requires the Entity ID to be URI.
 In AWS Cognito/Auth0, Entity ID is in URN format. 
 I wonder if Cognito/Auth0 is not supported by the IdP. Also, what's the difference between IdP's that require URI and URN for the Entity ID?
 Thank you!

Tried using regedit in GPO and a task scheduler that imports an AppAssociations.xml during login proces. None of it has worked and wondering if any of you has done something like this by not using computer configuration.

 For example, if you where planning on updating a customers server to the latest sql service pack, where would you even start to calculate a outage/update window. 
 Side note, there is no such thing as out of hours for this company as they are 24/7 so I can't just do it out of hours and let it take as long as it needs over the night.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve recently been involved in fitting out a new building with 400 desks and took the leap to using Dell USB-C monitors and daisy chaining display port to a second Dell monitor. We also use Dell Latitude laptops. Initially everything was working great except the cracks began to show quickly. 
 Because the second monitor is daisy chained Windows doesn’t know about it immediately when returning from sleep or hibernate. This means that any windows that were open before sleeping will all move back to the primary monitor. 
 Intermittently when docking, one of the monitors will be blurry. Changing resolution to anything else then changing back to 1080p fixes it. 
 Worst of all, randomly when returning from sleep and logging in, the whole laptop will reboot. We’ve been unable to figure this out and Dell are stumped too. 
 All up this has been a major reputation hit and we’re now having to go back to buying docks and having to mess around with re-cabling all these desks. On paper they were perfect but in practice not so much.

 I work at a small MSP and my boss wants me to put something in place to stop ex-employees accessing company resources. For example our Mailchimp account, [support@company.com](mailto:support@company.com) with a randomly-generated password. An employee leaves and we want to make sure they can't get into this account. Simple enough, change the password.
 What do I do when there's Mailchimp, Unifi, Namecheap, VMware, Cisco, 300 of these accounts? Changing all of these passwords individually when an employee moves on is obviously an option but there has to be a smarter way. For a bigger company with thousands of employees this would be a full time job. How do the big players handle this?

 Say I have a three-router full mesh OSPF network and all of them are inter connected with 10Gbps links . On R1, I wanted to steer traffic towards to R2 and only failover to R3 by manipulating the OSPF cost. I could use the bandwidth command under the transit interfaces to make R1-R3 interfaces have lower bandwidth OR use the ip ospf cost command under the transit interfaces to make R1-R3 path cost higher. But which one would introduce the least production impact? I believe either would cause OSPF to re-calculate and flood the routing table, right?

At this point all those circuits are currently 1G but I’ve read that the Ciena does have two 10G SFP ports. Would they be able to provide a 10G SMF handoff with these current 3930 devices?

 I'm totally green when it comes to networking. I went to a site yesterday where they had changed ISP's from Comcast to Ziply Fiber. The Ziply folks installed the demarc box, ran a cable to a RAD ETX-2i-10G and then left without making any other connections. 
 The people at the site had no idea how any of it worked and had no idea where the Comcast cable was coming in their building. I'm pretty sure I traced it to where Comcast comes in the building and goes into a fiber patch panel. 
 Am I able to just unsplice? the Comcast cable out of the patch panel and splice the new Ziply wire in? Or will they have to get a new patch panel to keep their current setup?

 The problem is with ECMP, I was expecting equal load balancing of traffic across all three nodes (with pfsense distributing the traffic with FRR). However, it looks likes its only choosing one "best" route even though it says the other two are multipath...

 Am I understanding ECMP correctly, or maybe FRR doesn't support round-robin ECMP? But if it doesn't, what's the purpose of any ECMP support?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 tl;dr: How do you provide internet to multiple locations and have it tie into your main network?
 I want to preface by saying that I have very little networking experience. However, the facility I work for no longer has a network administrator so I'm trying to learn some more of how it's setup. 
 Currently, there is one main location, and several satellite locations. From what I understand, the network comes in to the main building, and at some point is literally beamed over to 4 other locations. This is accomplished via emitters and receivers by Ubiquiti. As I've just found out, when one of those receivers goes down, Ubiquiti offers no support to help troubleshoot, or replace if needed. And replacing one involves climbing a long ladder with another ladder to reach the point that the receiver is on, mounting the equipment to the roof at a specific angle, and pointing it at the emitter at a precise point to receive the internet connection. All things that sound really specialized. 
 In any case, previously I worked at a school district. There were 19 locations, and no Ubiquiti or something similar wireless emitters in sight. 
 My question is, is something like this usually done by getting separate Internet connections configured, one for each building, and tying them into the main network? One of the Ubiquiti receivers is several miles away (so I've been told), I'm actually shocked it works at all. It seems like a really odd way to take care of something that seems mostly self explanatory... but I don't really know what I'm talking about.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone seen this before?
 To elaborate: For the past week now, maybe a little more, Google thinks my organization's IP range is in France, and not the US. After some testing we came to the conclusion that the problem is with Google.
  
Browsing to Google.com with any browser (we tried several), from within the company network: location shows as France
 Browsing to Google maps automatically opens France
 Location sharing in the browser is disabled company wide - browsers not sending location data
 Tried both Google and Bing; Bing has the right location
 We have our own ASN
 ARIN registration is current and correct
 Searched multiple publicly available geolocation DBs - all show the correct location for our IP range
  
Any advice would be appreciated!
 Or any clue on how to get a hold of the right people at Google. That seems nearly impossible!

If interested he directed me to reach out to their Hiring Manager, to which I did. The Hiring Manager emailed me back and stated "The job briefing and interview is conducted via email and you are required to pay attention, read carefully and respond as fast as you can to keep the conversation smooth. "
 I've never interviewed with a company that way. Is that normal? Seems very odd to me, and hard for him to even get to know me. Anybody else been through a similar situation?

 Can the Cisco switches be configured to automatically backup their configuration when a change is saved? Or periodically? Otherwise, what is the best way to save the configuration manually? I'm thinking in case I need to replace a failed unit. So then I would need to restore startup-config and the VLAN config. Anything else? Are there any gotchas or other things to consider?

But new office employees will be sitting at the farthest point, maybe 150M (edited after measuring) meters from the existing office and server room. The new space has its networking room and wiring. The owner wants new employees to connect to the main server room.

 The new space will have 60 employees. ( these users will be using our network share - lots of engineering drawings, etc. )
 How should I connect these two server rooms?

 I have been in the technology field for about a decade so not really long I guess. I started in the help desk and I am now a sys admin. I do not do any hiring. In my experience, when I work with a new employee (in the IT dept) and I see them doing the ol chicken pecker method to type out an email, I just feel like I am going to be in for a long day. Maybe its the few people I have worked with. I've seen people at my last job hire someone with "years of experience" just to find out they cant use the home keys. Next thing you know I have to explain a process to them several times. training new people is exhaustive.
 I have been using a mouse / keyboard since I was a kid so I don't expect everyone to be a fast typer but I feel like there is a correlation between keyboard familiarity and knowing your shit.
 Have any of you seen someone break this stigma that I have in my head? are there people out there in senior management positions that actually know what they are talking about and are chicken peckers? or new employees you got in? 
 Edit: a lot of people are taking this personally. I am not saying that I have an HR problem with a slow typer. or I wouldnt give them a chance. I wanted to see if anyone else that has seen someone be bad with a mouse / keyboard but be good as a technician.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm not sure if anyone else can give me a hand. I've started implementing MFA/radius auth across all my switches.
 The 2920's and others it works fine.
 I get to the 5406 and it's not. I'm half wondering if the source ip isn't what I think it is. 
 As the 5406 is a core switch, I don't know where the traffic is coming from.. (I would think that it would come from the IP I manage it from) but the commands primary-vlan and others mentioned in older docs don't exist anymore. I'm running KB.16.03.0006 
 radius-server host x.x.x.x key "******"
 radius-server timeout 15
 radius-server retransmit 2
 aaa authentication login privilege-mode 
 aaa authentication ssh enable radius local
 aaa authentication web enable radius loca
 ​
 At the moment I'm using this, the 5406 has a dozen IP's it could use to do authentications, the radius server requires I specify the IP the radius auth requests are coming from.. (fortinet's fortiauthenticator)
 Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We (the server/sysadmin team) have been managing SCCM for about 5 years. We use it for reporting, Windows client updates (monthly), some application installs, and other various means. 
 Recently, our Systems Architect has decided the help desk needs to manage Windows updates for the clients, his reasoning? They are workstations, the server team is not responsible for them. Ok, from a high level perspective, I agree. However, the system used to manage those updates is our responsibility. 
 He is really pushing this on the help desk, so I've decided him and I need to have a meeting about this. 
 I find several issues with this line he is trying to draw:
 •The help desk does not currently manage nor know how to use SCCM (I understand this does not mean it isn't their responsibility)
 •The sysadmin team has been managing SCCM for 5 years (this doesn't mean it's our responsibility)
 •None of our roles define SCCM as a responsibility
 Typically, a Desktop Engineer role would buffer this, but we don't have that role.
 So who is responsible? Managing clients is a gray area, some responsibility falls on us, some on the help desk. This all started when I pulled the data on our ~800+ clients running 1909, critically out of date. He said the help desk should have known and been on top of it, and here we are. 
 I have found little to no help desk roles in the industry where SCCM is a requirement, quite the opposite for sysadmin roles. 
 I look forward to and appreciate all your input.
 Edit: Lots of good points about this being an opportunity for the HD folks to grow. The problem is, they don't want to grow, or learn SCCM, or apply for our open sysadmin role. 
 I hope this provides some clarification on that front.

 I'm in the process of setting up an Azure VPN Gateway S2S connection (route-based IKEv2).
 For best throughput, Microsoft recommends to use GCMAES256 for both IPsec encryption and IPsec Integrity.
 Another supported option would be to use AES256 for IPsec encryption and SHA256 for IPsec integrity.
 I am wondering if there would be any security implications.
 Summarized, these are the configurations that I am considering for the IKEv2:
 configuration 1: GCMAES256:
  
 IKE Phase 1:

 Since throughput will be better using GCMAES256 for both IPsec encryption and IPsec Integrity, I want to use configuration 1.
 Would there be any reason to prefer configuration 2 over configuration 1 from a security point-of-view ?

 I am fairly new to IT. I am about to finish a 4 year degree (IT) and I have been working the helpdesk / light network admin work for the past year. I also have a few certs, Net+ and AWS CCP. 
 So I can’t say that I haven’t learned anything- I have learned a LOT. But I feel like learning actual in-demand skills at a high level, as well as actually retaining that information, is difficult.
 Recently, I’ve started taking my learning more seriously. Instead of just reading a book or watching a video, I actually break them down and document what I am learning in Notion. But I feel like the things that I am learning aren’t sticking like they do for some of the other senior guys on forums like this.
 How do you guys go about learning and actually retaining the information you learn? I’ve even had the thought that what I am doing now is right, because I am learning how to learn, aka getting better at learning new technologies, which I think is a foundational skill in IT.
 TLDR; How do you learn and retain knowledge specific to IT?

 Just wondering if when flipping the Auth method policy on to "All Users" if it'll cause any headaches with the previously setup alternative methods for authentication (such as SMS/etc), or only with those that may be using the M$ Auth App will that impact.
 We have been piloting it here since preview with a few of our staff, it works great. Its just trying now to figure out how to turn this on and then begin full migration over to it from those that are using the less secure methods (SIM Swap/etc). 
 TIA!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys
 Tbh, not sure if this is a Windows or Networking question .. but here goes.
 TL;DR - Is it normal for a DHCP server to show ~150 Request/Ack entries for a given PC for a given day?
 .
 On my workplace I'm investigating some logs from a specific PC, where I need to crossreference the timestamps with the DHCP server's communication with said PC.
 The PC was on-prem on the day in question, talking directly with the company DHCP server (although there might have been a firewall in between the LAN networks).
 When I ask my colleague to pull the DHCP logs (from Logpoint) for one 24-hour period, I get somewhere close to 150 DHCP entries in the log, with a ca. 50/50 distribution of DHCPREQUEST and DHCPACK (status: RENEW).
 The initial DORA process on the PC's boot looks fine - it's all the entries after that which puzzle me. The PC retains the same IP address all day.
 Lease time is 4 hours, I'm told (can't confirm on my own PC, working from home right now).
 .
 My first thought is that the user closes the lid many times during the day, and the PC will negotiate a renew on the lease when it wakes again. However, my colleagues insist that the PC should retain its IP when going to sleep (not hibernate). My Google skills fall short when trying to confirm this.
 But even if the PC renegotiates every time - it would mean that the user closes their lid every 10 minutes or so during an entire day, and opens it immediately afterwards. This seems extremely unlikely.
 I've asked the DHCP guys at work about this, but they're out of office these days, so I'm trying here meanwhile.
 Does anyone have an input as to why the Logpoint logs show ~150 DHCP entries for a single PC during one work day (assuming normal user behaviour)?

 I want to use LAPS only for clients. And setting the GPO to apply only on clients OU.
 Installing LAPS MGMT tool on a DC shouldnt be any problems right? As long as I dont set the LAPS settings GPO to apply for the DC.

 This guy has now gone to another job somewhere in security in the same business and handed over BAU support to us. This environment is ancient, all running on EoL hardware, out of support operating systems, lights up like a Christmas tree on pen-test reports that we've been trying to address for six months now...although at this stage it would be easier to just turn the whole lot off, politically that's not really possible.

I'll be honest that part of it is on me: in the past year, I've lost a brother, been hospitalized twice, had my wife hospitalized, father with a quad-bypass, mother very recently with a stint replacement, and a minor family member we've had to coach through some life-altering nonsense that I'd rather not repeat. So, yeah, I've been a little out-of-pocket this year, and that's on me. 
 I got this guy not only his job, but his position, then he did an end-run around me with an outgoing C-level exec to get team lead, and due to a manpower shortage at the time, fell into management. I was honestly okay with all of that, because I knew the guy was A-list material; I wouldn't have gone to bat for him otherwise. Also, fuck management... in 25 years of this, I've never wanted to be one, so more power to those who do. 
 So, here I am... trying my best to be cordial with a guy who has from day one of having access to payroll been upset that I make more than him, while he's talking to me like the goddamned godfather, filling a position I had the opportunity to leave at least five times, now trying to get out-from-under before I get fired or PIP'd into a corner, all while trying not to be the asshole who fracks off without leaving documentation. 
 Sigh... I was honestly hoping to be able to retire at this one. Ten years with an employer is a pretty good stint, in my book.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the last week, there's been 4 major attacks affecting certain social agencies and NGO's, i've been curiosly following these stories and one culprit that keeps popping up is 'MFA Fatigue' , in an attempt to secure our infrastructure or reduce chances of falling prey to some of these attacks, i've been implementing a handful of measures/policies, most of which i actually learnt from here through various posts and responses.
 In the wake of this, i have a few questions or concerns that i'm hoping to get some feedback on how you all handle this in your organizations.
  
how do you deal with MFA fatigue? by preventing MFA from prompting via push notification but rather require the user open the App and fill in the code? this way if you aren't logging in anywhere, you won't have the need to open the app?
 how do you also handle Atypical travel? blocking IP or setting strict account lockout threshold?
 is SSPR adviceable? or does it grant an attacker an added option to gain full control?
  
I already did research most this via google and Microsoft learn...so as the attackers. i was just wondering if there are any other methods apart from the obvious of dealing with these attacks.
 ​
 thanks.

The tunnel connects our US and China offices. Trouble is, I've never been able to explain why. To get it back I usually have to failover to our backup ISP in the US office (and fail back to the primary again) and it will come back up.
 There are other occasions when the tunnel from China to our other offices (also in Asia) fails so the common theme is China. What's the likely reason? Could it just be the great FW in China having an impact? We use Check Point firewalls - happy to learn something new!

 I've been a bit of an idiot and i didnt realize that Windows 10 had version 22H2. I assumed that was Windows 11 and onwards. My site of around 300 machines are all running 21H2 so from my understanding i can upgrade via the enablement package. 21H2 have support until the middle of next year so no immediate rush.
 I want to push this out to a few machines to test, i use WSUS and client side targetting so applying this to individual machines can be a pain as i would have to setup a new GPO to target a new client side group.
 I was wondering if its possible to get hold of the files and push it out via PDQ instead? I notice it says they are not available from the Windows Update catalogue though.
 Has anyone else used the enablement package outside of WSUS some how and managed to upgrade machines?
 Appreciate any advice

 Quite a few months ago (Or maybe even last year), we had a case of Conficker on one of our client's DCs. Back then, I thought I completely removed the thing, since it was coming from an old XP machine, made it's way to the DC and didn't really do anything else, since it was so effing old. I used ZenMap, to, supposedly, find all remains and remove them, but now I've gotten a notice, that the disk-space for C:\ is getting low. I checked to find Sophos Endpoint Agent creating snapshot files by the hour, because it kept finding and deleting the same file in Sys32, that is being generated by some mysterious Conficker Virus remains. 
 I checked online, but didn't get any real results, just some general tips, on how to remove Conficker. Now, I'm not really experienced, when it comes to malware and viruses, so I don't know, where to start, that's why I'm turning to your expertise again. If you need more info, please go ahead and ask, and I'll provide any necessary info.
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I work for an employer with a number of different sites. The organization's main office is moving from one location with multiple one-story buildings to a seven-story office building over the next year or two. Until now, our scheme for data has mostly followed 10.111.X.Y, with X being an arbitrary VLAN ID associated with a specific department and Y being the host. VoIP has typically mirrored that but with a VLAN ID equal to X + 100 (i.e. VLAN 50's voice VLAN is 150), and wireless has been a single VLAN across the entire organization. 
 At our new building, we are tentatively planning on sticking with 10.111.X.Y, but with X being an arbitrary VLAN associated with the floor, not the department. The idea is to hopefully simplify management on our end since there will be multiple departments per floor but only one switch stack. We're planning on the same voice VLAN scheme. We're undecided on whether to do a single wireless subnet or one per floor. We're also considering adding another VLAN schema (like X + 200) for various maintenance devices on each floor of the new building, like cameras, HVAC equipment, etc.
 Does this all make sense? Is there a more efficient way of doing this? What's worked in your experience? We don't have too large a number of end users or devices, but we figure if there was ever a time to adjust our addressing it would be now. As a side note, what is standard practice for VPN pools? Right now we are using a completely random range (10.100.20.x). Would it make more sense to use something in the 10.111.x range? Thanks in advance for your thoughts!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been in a few different positions at some level of Sysadmin/Systems Engineer for the past 10 years or so, have a 4 year degree in IT. I have worked in an array of different industries, most notably finance, manufacturing, and media.
 My previous position had me in DevOps engineering where I was able to master Kubernetes, Helm, CI/CD, and Infrastructure-as-code best practices. Unfortunately due to various reasons I reached that "burn-out" point where I was underpaid and overwhelmed with the work being requested of me, so I found a new position earlier this year, working in media.
 A few months in, the transition between the two environments has been, well.. extreme.
 Pros: Finally getting paid what I'm worth, in an industry more to my liking, with less responsibility!
 Cons: Mostly Windows environment (few hundred servers, mostly bare-metal), no documentation aside from a handful of spreadsheets, inconsistent communication within the department, no one's even heard of a code repository before, management is very resistant to change. 
 I'm someone who's done all the DevOps things and enjoys doing them when the workloads are reasonable. This is the path I want to grow in as (from what I can tell) the world is moving more towards microservice/IaaS models. 
 Am I in the right for wanting to gracefully push the place more towards modern standards? or should I just accept that this is the culture in the new industry and maybe this position isn't a good fit after all?

 I have a set of GS meraki go switches and GR wireless APs on which I’m trying to configure VLANs for GUEST network. I have a Firewalla which i set up in router mode but it doesn’t seem like i can configure VLANs on my Meraki GO equipment without a GX router. Is that correct?

arttime is a clock, timer, time manager, ASCII/ANSI/PETSCII/Unicode text-art and ~animation viewer that comes with a library of curated quality text-art. Notes: 1) it's coded in zsh, but that's not required to be user's shell to install or use. 2) art credits are at the bottom of release notes. 3) read how to render text art more close to artist's intent in arttime wiki. 4) Want to volunteer? read instructions at the bottom of release notes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have 3 AD. One in cloud. Two on prem. Recently promoted the Cloud to become Primary holding all FSMO role.
 Initially all replication are doing well. 
 Recently start popping error of sysvol failed to replicate followed by AD changes not showing on PDC despite DFS, repadmin, dcdiag and dfsdiag not showing any error at all. 
 Currently clueless on what to do. 
 PDC is hosted on AWS. Built fron scratch on Server 2019.
 Member server are Server 2016 which u will call SDC1 & SDC2
 Additional info.
 Sync between SDC1 and SDC2 are doing fine.
 Tried performing repadmin /syncall /AdeP and replicate from option in ADSS on PDC but still not showing latest changes (new computer object and user creation)
 UPDATE 1: If i perform repadmin /syncall on PDC it goes straight to syncall finished without showing the usual replication is in progress information.
 Update 2: will temporary put it as solved. As i realize its Inter-Site and not Intra-Site hence the default replication timing is 3 hours. But will keep a look out if problem still shows will do a ADFS restore.
