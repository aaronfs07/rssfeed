 I have a small company I am supporting in IT related topics. One of the users has a lot of spam mails incoming. Do you know any client solution that doesn’t necessarily need an email gateway installed? It could cost a few euros, that’s not a problem.
 Thanks in advance

 I wasn't sure where put this post , at r/sysadmin or r/programming, so i decided write here.
 I am 18 yo and I'm in an IT technical school so just starting my way in IT.
 I have a dilemma because I don't know what path to take. I'm very interested in systems administration,networks ( I passed CCNA) etc, but I also really like web programming (js and python html,css, etc). I'm graduating from technical school in a year, and I don't plan to go to college just study in my own. I would like to ask you guys for some advice, because I totally don't know what to choose and focus on something. I don't want to do and learn several things at once, because it doesn't benefit me much.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this happened. A long lost laptop was found in the company that was thought to be part of a rather large security incident we had 2 yrs ago. We really like to access the laptop.
 This is the case:
 - Boots successfully to the windows 10 login screen
 - Computer has bitlocked enabled, Bitlocker key itself is unknown however.
 - Computeraccount was removed from the domain and can not be restored anymore.
 - Because of this, no domain admin or other domain account works.
 - Previous user shown on login screen has unknown password, no other cached domain accounts.
 - Local admin account on the laptop is likely disabled and has an unknown password
 - BIOS is accessible
 We are most interested in a login to get the bitlocker key to enable decrypting the forensic backup.
 I'm really stuck here. Any thoughts?

 I have a question about a scheduled task
 If you have a scheduled task to run on a timer and the timer is one hour from the time the scheduled task is created. What happens if the user shuts down their machine before the hour ?
 Does the scheduled task never get to run? Does it run on next log on or next time the machine is turned on?
 The trigger is :
 Run powershell script after 60mins 
 Not after workarounds yet or different ideas. Just troubleshooting some that dont run and I want to know why first
 Thank you !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have inherited a Unifi Wifi network which uses RADIUS to authenticate computers onto an Active Directory domain. 
 Problem is, nearly every single laptop does NOT connect to wifi (v6) until the domain (or local) user logs in, and this is killing some, not all, of my GPO. 
 As an example, I set a GPO to add a local admin on laptops. That works. But if I try to deploy an .msi it fails miserably, with error logs telling me the network wasn't available. If I run GUPDATE, it fails with the couldn't complete message, in that it knows there is an .msi in waiting type of thing. 
 GP Result shows the policies are being applied to the local endpoint.
 I can give more detail when I am back in the office on specifics. 
 If I plug the laptop into the network (physical cable) the .msi deploys without issue, so i am relatively happy that I set the GPO up correctly. 
 I am not entirely sure RADIUS authentication is set up correctly on the DC, but if I am honest, I am a bit stuck where to look, or more importantly, how to check. 
 I have set the network to wait, and the laptops now take 60secs to boot to a Windows log in screen, but the wifi is disconnected, so it's pretty pointless having wait for network in place! 
 As mentioned at the beginning, I have inherited this, and there has been an absolute ton of work required to roll out an RMM to approx 150 laptops, much of which I've had to do via Powershell due to the .msi failing, plus other work to get the estate where it needs to be. This GPO thing has taken a back seat, but it is nagging at me to get it fixed. 
 I could leave it now i have an RMM in place, but I would prefer to fix it and have it working as it should so it doesn't bite me in the future. 
 I'm posting this from home on a public holiday, so don't have specific information to hand, but will gladly respond with any info when I am back in the office. 
 Any ideas?

 I have not responded to him, but I feel this is not right.
 I'm not part of the interviewing or decision-making panel, and i didn't even know about this upcoming interview -but i usually prepare the test computer which will have the practical tests or activities when im told to do so i.e just installing programs, dev environments, user profiles etc
 Should I alert my boss(who is part of the interview), ignore her, or hear what she has to ask
 On the other hand i just wouldn't want someone to lose an interview opportunity that could transform their life and that of their loved ones over something like this, i.e. if the candidate gets disqualified before the interview (it's just my little caring heart).. Maybe they mean well, or maybe they want to gain an unfair advantage by seeking insider information

 I'm pretty confident with Solaris and do a good amount of bash scripting. What's going to be similar between Solaris and Linux? What's going to be different? Are there any pitfalls I should look out for or handy courses I should take?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've completed the shift to be 100% cloud and have no need for on-prem AD anymore. We've disabled AD Connect via the Set-MsolDirSyncEnabled -EnableDirSync $false command and uninstalled the agent. We also ran Okta sync and uninstalled that agent as well. 
 We have Okta upstream as our profile source and users are federated with that. Everything appears to be operating nominally but AAD still has some remnants of on-prem AD. It shows Password hash sync, Seamless single sign on and pass-through authentication as enabled (this is after 72 hours of running the command). Running a Get-msolcompanyinformation shows the DirSyncService account name and PasswordSynchronizationEnabled as true but DirectorySynchronizationEnabled is set to false.
 Will that change/disappear over time or are there other things that need to be done to remove them?
 Also, does anything officially need to be done with on-prem AD? We are moving offices and have no need for the current network either so things like DNS and networking aren't a concern. I think it's as simple as shutting down the servers and scrubbing the hard drives but am wondering if there's a step or two that's missing.

 I've been a long time Zabbix user for monitoring. Though I recently discovered an issue with my Zabbix that basically means I need to re-install the whole thing. And that amount of work has made me question if I I should go a paid solution.
 What are people using to monitor servers and networking. And what do you manage.
 I am testing PRTG, and when I did a scan of a VM I started wondering, what do I actually need to check on a VM, is just space of drive and some services enough?
 Cheers.

 Maybe even someone there that knows you, or knows someone you know, and presumably has the ability to locate a person's activities. See that they visit certain favorites or habits or wherever.
 Is this realistic in any sense, like for someone who lives in a smaller town? Is anything stopping some random ISP employee from seeing what you do online if they choose? Is it de-aggregated in any way? Or is a VPN truly necessary for all activities, not just special ones...
 I worry that VPNs aren't truly secure. You're passing the puck to the VPN server host, and even then how do you know your VPN isn't leaking or dropping out for a split second? I have never been able to trust in VPNs.

This is a scenario I’ve done a few years ago in the past, though it seems newer security settings on Windows don’t make the exact method I used possible, and I’m not even sure if the configuration I’m attempting is possible in a secure manner anymore.
 I have access to 
 NPS on Windows Server
 Unfi Access Points
 Active Directory
 ADCS is set up, computers & users are set to auto enroll certificates. User certificates should be unique and are stored in AD so they will roam from computer to computer.
 Is there a way to have enterprise Wi-Fi set up so that when a domain joined computer boots, it authenticates to the Wi-Fi networking using the machine account (via certificates or any other manner), then when the user logs in, the Wi-Fi then authenticates as the user.
 I’ve been able to get one or the other working, but not both – client needs both because there are computers that do not have a ethernet connection that need to be managed even when users aren’t sitting at them. Ideally this will all be transparent to the user and use their credentials/certificates in the background.
 This needs to work for a user that has never signed on to the machine as well – and ideally I’ll be able to filter the users that are able to access the network (eg WORKSTATION1 always on at the logon screen – Bob can log in to WiFi, but Alex cannot as part of their AD Group Membership)

 I'm a run-of-the-mill shared hosting customer looking for advice: 
 For years, I had Barracuda's email gateway security product, sold through my hosting company, and I was always happy with it. Covered all email addresses on all domains, and I could still manage email accounts/forwarders from cPanel with the gateway kind of invisibly in the middle. 
 During the last year, Barracuda bowed out of the small-fry market and my ISP directed me to "professional email services" from titan.email which has not been great at all, and in some respects is absolutely awful (for reasons I'd be happy to share if anyone cares).
 Anyhoo, are any of you aware of a relatively affordable email gateway security service for someone like me? Between titan and spam assassin, I don't seem to have really good choices.
 Thanks in advance...

 We use Google Sheets/Docs/Google Meet a lot for our collab and video conferencing but lately we’ve been having a vendor convincing my director to migrate to M365 / One Drive / Teams. 
 I find M365 to be extremely clunky and diffficult to manage. Is it just me or ya’ll feel the same?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Traditionally, computing has been deterministic, which refers to the inherent consistency, repeatability, and provability of outcomes in data processing. This is because the output strictly adheres to the programming logic (code written by software developers).
 #LLMs leverage similarity search to process information. During the training phase, LLMs identify similarities among text tokens and create an extensive neural network to capture these patterns. These patterns are then represented in a high-dimensional vector space, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of textual data.
 When processing user input, input sentence is converted into a vector. The OpenAI model then searches for the nearest tokens in the multi-dimensional space, using the shortest distance as a measure of similarity. There is no developers doing the coding to write different logic. Each sentence is following same vector search process.
 Below I show how a sentence is transform into a vector. The model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) in this example is using 768 dimensions. OpenAI has its own API endpoint that do similar processing (text-embedding-ada-002) with 1536 dimensions.
 >>> from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransforme 
 >>> sentences = ["We are at the dawn of a new era...", "Each sentence is converted"]
 >>> model = SentenceTransformer('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2') 
 >>> embeddings = model.encode(sentences)

 I'm recently started learning about datagrams and IP header and I'm confused for now. To be specific, If we're sending datagram without fragmentation, I wanted to ask in which fields router is going to change their contents?
 I know that (I would post a picture of ip header but I can't) IP header constists vers, hlen, type of service, total length, ident, flags, fragment offset, ttl, type, header checksum, source IP address, destination IP address, IP options, padding and beginning of payload (data). So again, speaking of regular datagram sending without fragmentation, in which fields the content will be changed?
 ​
 Also, what is the difference if we would do that with fragmentation?

 some info about the systems : its HP,RICOH,Konika Minolta,Lexmark Printers, all of them sitting on the same VLAN dedicated to printers and have static IP address. We use 2016 print server.
 The issue, Printers keep going offline randomly and the only solution to wake them up is to disconnect the network cable and connect it back.
 Lets say out of 12 printers it keeps happening to the same 5-6 printers.
 Now I have disabled SNMP in all of the printers but seems it didn`t help, they use RAW and port 9100.
 I have checked sleep settings in all of them but you cannot disable it completely.
 We have ALCATEL switches and everything is managed by other company.
 My question is anyone had any experience with this kind of problem?
 maybe the issue is with the configuration on the switch ports since other printers don`t have those problems?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I got this small bit of "what's best way to implement this" for a small business.
 There's 3 WAN uplinks, from different providers - main one's fiber, second's through a point to point wifi high speed link and 3rd one is a last resort SIM modem with static IPv4.
 There's no ISP support to run a dynamic protocol on either of the 3.
 R1 must dial a PPPoE connection with auth, then receive static IPv4 on pppoe1 interface. Same for R2. Both can also get a /48 IPv6, but that's for another time. R3 has a static IPv4.
 Magic question here being: what dynamic protocol could be used between each of the 3 "R" edge routers and FW1 so that:- 0.0.0.0/0 is redistributed, but removed from advertisements should the PPPoE link fail- order priority remains the same (traffic flows through R1, should that fail, through R2 or - finally - through R3 as last resort)
 Initially thinking running IBGP between FW1 and each R router, but with a default originate, the session will always put 0.0.0.0/0 in the session no matter if the link is up or down, or with a "redistribute connected route-map X", with route-map X permitting just interface pppoe1, but I'm pretty sure such advertisement won't include the 0.0.0.0/0 in it.
 Any other alternatives/protocols just for the default route ?
 From a vendor perspective, all items involved - R1,R2,R3,FW1 - are Linux machines (VMs with NICs in passthrough mode), so any dynamic protocol supported by FRRouting is a go.

 One of my team members wants to go full Meraki. We already use their APs and their MX firewalls. 
 I and others on the team are resultant as we sometimes have needed more advanced policy-based routing and such on the Catalysts. On the other hand, we have a mish-mash of versions, routes, etc across the environment.

 Last time I was here, there was a lot of talk about the death of the "traditional sys admin" and how everything could be infrastructure as code soon.
 It also seemed that many were predicting the death of the data center and "everything" would be SaaS and/or AWS based soon.
 So I am curious:
 1) Is the traditional sys admin role dead?
 2) Is the physical data center dead?
 3) Did the infrastructure as code revolution actually happen?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings:
 My company previously rented a Meraki from an MSP that managed our switches. When we went with a new MSP, they advised we purchase a Fortigate 80E. However, in so doing, we lost the ability to manage our switches without factory restoring them (the first MSP took their secrets with them). The next MSP that sold us the Fortigate always said they would get around to restoring our Cisco switches but ... well, they are out ex-MSPs for a reason.
 So, our company decides to move everything internal. Updating the network is my job. Our physical footprint is shrinking so we have some extra switches. I restore a Cisco SG300 to factory, patch/upgrade it move it into production as a replacement for an in-production, unpatched Cisco SG300 (like-for-like). 
 The Fortigate was config'd to do all the heavy lifting. It does all the routing, hands out IP leases, etc. 
 So here is the problem. The updated/patched Cisco is installed and up and running. Switching like a champ except it is not appearing at all in the Fortigate ARP table. Further still, the Fortigate keeps giving it an IP address that has already been assigned from the DHCP pool. When I attempt to take DHCP out the equation and assign the Cisco a static IP by MAC address it does not work because the Fortigate never gives an indication it sees the switch (no entry in the DHCP table, no entry in the ARP table). 
 I suspect there must be something misconfigured on the Switch but I can't access the gui without a reliable IP address. I can access via console but I am not physically there until monday.
 So, in the interim, any ideas? I am sure its something simple I am missing but sometimes the simplest thing is the easiest thing to overlook.
 Thank you!
 EDIT: I’ll add that the web gui on Cisco was verified as working and it received a unique IP when it was not connected directly to the Fortigate.

 Looking at getting some basic fibre fault finding/troubleshooting tools to help with (just had this happen this week) "the fault is with your equipment" after fibre cutting and splicing has been done and said network was working right up until the point of the new joins being terminated into the comms rack.
 Anyway, looking at the Fluke (totally open to other options) FiberLert and VisiFault and if I should get both or just one or even something else totally.
 What I *think* we need is just a basic visual fault finder that shoots a light down a link but would like to hear from others what they recommend that onsite teams have/use for fault finding/troubleshooting before calling in professions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey gang, I have ended up wearing the IT hat in our small business (10-20 employees) and have a question as we've run into a bit of an expansion/growth problem :)
 We have a program we need to run to manage our projects which runs on windows and only within the LAN. This is great except a large percentage of our staff use Macs and work outside of the office (don't ask!). Our current solutions is to have a bunch of desktop PCs running Splashtop (similar to TeamViewer) within the office so people on macs/working remotely can splashtop in and run the application.
 While the Mac users can boot-up a VM and run the tool via VPN we find that process is way too slow compared to just jumping on a Splashtop machine and opening the app (and requires them to be able to set up and manage a VM+VPN).
 This works ok but we're finding it's clearly not scalable or efficient.
 ​
 Does anyone know if MS/someone else offers a terminal server product that would be able to host multiple remote connections and instances of the same application at once? Alternatively is there a recommended method for having a server run say 6 VMs each with their own Splashtop instance? I imagine this clearly requires a special MS license? Is there a way to do this with Azure so we can scale it up and down?

It looks like our RMM software has locked updates on our servers, which our infra admin found out when he went to patch today. The same settings have been in place on our workstations, and I was able to find the settings enumerated in the updates menu there. I just can't find them in local gpo or the registry.
 I'm not sure I can post the screenshot of the settings, so I'll just type them out here:
 Disable automatic updates Source: Administrator Type: Group Policy Get updates for other Microsoft products Source: Administrator Type: Group Policy Disable check for updates by user Source: Administrator Type: Group Policy Disable Pause updates by user Source: Administrator Type: Group Policy Set Automatic Update options Source: Administrator Type: Group Policy 
 Everything in local GPO under Templates\Components\Updates is set to not configured. A few articles online advise going through and turning on all the Windows 10 Telemetry settings, but I'm not sure that's the fix here. Thanks in advance.

But for crying out loud we have a balcony, hell take the disabled toilets if you really have to but the network cabinet’s ventilation is not as good as most people think it is (lost count how many times I’ve complained to facilities about that). Depending on where you release, the smell can linger and mature. I had to show one of the AT&T engineers to the networking cabinet in Friday and the smell was so bad I had to apologise and keep the door open for a good 10 mins before he was comfortable enough to work. 
 The worst thing is that this is not the first time this has happened, it’s the 3rd!!!!. I swear to God I only have 2 months left in this hell hole but I’m going to make it my life’s mission to find out who the serial cabinet farter is if it’s the last thing I do. Even if I have to suspend everyone’s security badge, I do not get paid enough to write an email to my staff on a Tuesday to reserve farting at a better more considerate place, can’t imagine how that’s going to go down.

I manage everything on the backend (NAS, VOIP, door access, etc), but I don’t have time to keep up with the workstations so it works. The MSP provides a security package for the users, handle printers, updates, and a few other odds and ends. We switched MSPs last year because of some interpersonal conflicts and the new company looked great. They had a nice portfolio, interviewed well, tickled my ears with a solid “we know this is your network we’re here to help”, AND they specialized in our business type. Part of their contract outside of their maintenance agreement was an AP upgrade for the building. They sold us on a UniFi system and we deployed. A few days go by and I start noticing some weird dropouts in a few different places so I put in a ticket for them to check the auto-negotiation of channels and see if the UDM recommended any changes, etc. crickets Two days later I follow up with an email crickets 3 days later I email the account manager and reply was “I don’t see anything on our end, if you have a minute can you log in and see what you see?” I let him know that a login wasn’t created for me yet, but I’d be happy to. I get the invite, accept, and my jaw hits the floor. The manager had given me access to every one of his accounts, with full admin, AND access to their other customer’s financial backups that they vaulted for them. Needless to say that was our last week retaining that company.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there, former sysadmin turned pentester here. Recently, in almost every environment, I've been able to privesc from a regular user to Domain Admin using AD CS vulnerabilities.
 I definitely recommend running Certipy or Certify (compiled binary) to see if you can identify any vulnerabilities in your environment. As far as I know, this stuff won't come up on a Nessus scan. I know when I was a sysadmin I set this up insecurely (has now been fixed). However, AD CS is easy to set up without knowing some of the security implications of the configurations.
 The guys over at Spectorops who came out with their paper on attacking AD CS (Certified pre-owned) also have a good talk on "ReCertifying Active Directory Certificate Services".
 Edit: I linked both Certify and Certipy earlier. Certify is a windows application. Certipy is based on python. I prefer certipy. If you want to run certipy it’s pretty easy. One way is to setup a Kali VM. Download that here. 
 Then next through the Kali install. If it pulls dns and up from DHCP you should be good to go. After you’re in, open up a command prompt and type 
 pip3 install certipy-ad 
 Then run
 certipy find -vulnerable -stdout -u lowprivuser@domain.local -p password

 Since the computer locks on sleep, my plan B is just to set the monitor and computer sleep timeouts to the same values, but out of curiosity I'd like to know if this is possible first.

At the risk of disclosing too much I’m in a management position but don’t have much technical skills anymore and was hoping for some general career advice and CV writing tips. Im pretty much getting butchered in a lot of interviews because I’ve “lost touch” with tech in general :(.

 I'm looking to backup Azure vms running MSSQL, and those servers have separate managed disks containing the MDF, LDF, and daily backups. Would veeam for azure also backup those managed disks or is it just going to grab the vm and it's OS drive?

 I have configured VLAN 2 on an SVI on the Juniper and Cisco switches, with trunk links between them. I can ping all the way from R1 to R4 with no problem. 
 Routers 2, 3 and 4 all have adjacencies to each other. R1 only has an adjacency to R2 but `show isis neighbors' shows R3 and R4 as being in the INIT stage. I've checked the MTU, even changed it and I'm getting the same behavior. I've put my configs below, and I'm hoping the experts here can point me in the right direction, what am I missing here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So in the past I've mostly developed custom solutions using SharePoint with JavaScript, HTML/CSS, as well as calling the SharePoint API. 
 I'm consulting for a company and so far I've talked only to the non-technical guys. The non-technical guys told me that their in house engineering team 'overcomplicated' the process by adding a lot of if/else conditions, etc. The engineering team hasn't written any documentation, so I'm not inclined to believe that the process that they came up with is the most clear and easy to follow. At the same time, if the process was super simple (setting up a SharePoint form, automating tasks with Power Automate and Power Automate), then the non-technical team could have just used the drag and drop interface and do it themselves. It's sort of a typical issue where the non-engineers don't understand exactly what needs to be done on the technical side, so they think the issue is way more simple than it actually is. 
 I've been asked to come up with a recommendation for the best path moving forward and I'm not super sure what to suggest. I'm leaning towards starting from scratch, writing custom JavaScript when needed, and then of course, writing clear and easy to use documentation. 
 Part of me wonders though if the hardest part of this whole workflow is simply working through all these very domain specific edge cases. I can foresee issues down the line where the people giving the directions / exec team doesn't have a good understanding of their current systems, yet they'll still want a very specific result. 
 I guess my question is what to 'recommend' for next best steps that gives the exec team confidence in my recommendations, and also reduces the headache / back and forth nitpicking that I am anticipating with the exec team?

 Amazon Bussness has a form where you can provide details of a project and they will give you a custom quote on huge quantity of something.
 I can't remember what the minimum is for a large quantity quote but I think it is truly meant for large enterprise rollouts. For example: 10000 Sticks of 16gb ddr4 ram or 10000 iPad cases.
 (Also open to other suggestions of of a good vendor to buy a large quantity of ram from and suggestions on the best brands.)

It was the power cord for the monitor’s power brick, so I can only imagine when it would lift, power would get pulled through the hdmi cable and, zap! He’d get a shock.

Web links [...] in the Outlook for Windows app will open in Microsoft Edge. [...] A similar experience will arrive in Teams.
 Links will open in Microsoft Edge even if it is not the system default browser in Windows.
  
Because fuck respecting user choices and leading by example. Gotta continue pushing Edge no matter what.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey y'all! I started working for a small nonprofit and I've been tasked with improving their network infrastructure. Currently, all their main network is in one main building and it's branching out to 2 separate buildings with an outdoor CAT 6 cable that is just hanging through the roof (it goes through trees as well). Of course, the internet in the outbuildings is very poor, barely reaching 50mbps while the main building has speeds of ~500mbps. 
 I'm proposing using Fibre optic cable underground that goes from the main building to the two outbuildings. My plan is as follows:
  
Dig a trench of about 18-30" deep. 
 Use PVC for conduit and pass armored pre-terminated single mode Fibre optic cable through it. 
 The ends will be connected to media converters to convert the optic signals both ways. 
 The media converters will then be connected to the router with an ethernet cable and from there to the switches. 
  
In yalls opinions, is this a sound plan? Am I missing anything or not taking into consideration something? 
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company purchased a building recently, and inherited a Honeywell access control system. The company we purchased it from had a ProWatch server that is now disconnected. Until we can decide on new floor plans/layouts and then rip and replace the access control system, we're currently stuck with the badges that we got from the old tenant. 
 We're running out of badges at this point, and I was hoping to be able to get connected to these controllers and add/change some badges. It's not a pressing matter yet because very few people have moved in, but as we start doing construction and the like it's going to get complicated. 
 We'd really rather not pay Honeywell for their ProWatch software only to replace it 6 months down the line. Anyone have any experience working with these systems outside of the way Honeywell intended? If we're stuck then we're stuck and we'll deal with it. Just looking for options.
 Failing this I may just get a badge cloner and some re-writables.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, Our department recently was given a couple free racks. However, we use vertical mount PDUs. This picture here shows how they attach, with the kind of 'hook on PDU slots downward with weight/gravity into hole in rack' - I don't know what this mounting connection is called, if it does have a formal name.
 Unfortunately, the new freebie racks don't have this socket-for-a-hook that our existing racks, APC units, have. Instead they have these odd square holes surrounded by small circular holes. Problem: I also don't know what this is called so my Google-Fu is lacking.
 I know that attachments like this exist where you consume 1U or 2U to add horizontally-jutting out attachments which adds these sockets, but I've worked with those before and they really take up a lot of space in a rack that I'd rather be using for network cables (gone are the days of one cable per physical host, hah). Also we put our Cisco switches at the top of our racks, exactly where these horizontal add-ons would go.
 So instead I'm wondering if any of you know of an item that can attach into those square holes in my picture, to add a round socket so I can hang my vertical PDUs. Or even just the terminology, so I can at least do more effective searches.

We place 2 servers 1 in each datacenter. Each server has a 100Gbit network card but 40gbit dac cable. We can only reach 30gbit instead of 39/40 bit with iperf. When the servers where directly connected they reached 39/40. Does anybody know what is going wrong ?
 The connection is like this
 Server -> 40gbit -> switch -> 100Gbit <- switch <- 40gbit <- server
 All switches are dell S5232f We ordered 100Gbit dac to check what will happen on that speed.
 Maybe someone has had the same problem before?

Not a big fish, but big enough to spend a few thousand $ per month and have a dedicated customer success rep. I'm pretty disappointed in the new team that was assigned to me, and I wonder if it's a widespread issue, or just the luck of the draw.
 Recently, a lot has changed at Cloudflare:
  
They reorganized things to downgrade their baseline enterprise support, and make you pay for the "premium" level that used to be the baseline. That's fine- I don't need that much support. And I was honestly surprised at how much handholding they gave me before.
 The Customer Success team turned over a few times before I could even meet them. Again, that's fine, and understandable if Cloudflare is shaking things up.

 The issue is that USB audio devices with microphones attached directly to the laptop will show that no microphone input is available. If you are looking at the old Sound control panel, you will see the microphone entry but no level meter off to the right.
 The fix was to rollback the driver to the previous version, in our case .6815 version.

Today i was forwarded an email by account asking if the email was legit. It had made it pas all our safeguards, looked legit but the person in accounting noticed the from email did not match the normal sender. 
 While picking the email apart it was indeed a spoofed email with a .PDF malware attachment. Caught by a keen eye, the security training we've done and the test emails are working! 
 Anyway through my dissection of the email i was able to track it back to the company that owned the domain and found that it was a compromised O365 account. It was a doctors office in NYC about 90 minutes from our location. 
 I thought "Great i got their contact info let me just give them a heads up to have their IT look into the issue." Let me tell you this did not go at all how i had hopped it would. 
 I called their office and asked to speak with the Doctor running the practice or the office manager. After a moment on hold i got to speak with the office manager. I explained who i was, what company i was with and relayed my contact info should they need to follow up. I then explained that we received an email from their O365 portal and that one of their accounts or possibly their whole O365 account was potentially compromised and they should speak with their IT team to investigate. 
 I don't know if i sent this poor persons brain into overload or what but as soon as i finished talking they started to berate me like i was somehow the person that compromised their systems. I didn't want any recognition i just wanted to do the right thing and let them know of the possible breach. But instead all i got was about 3 minutes of angry Karren before they simply hung up. 
 Any one else come across something similar? Try to do the right thing by letting someone know only for it to fall on deaf ears or worse?

 Our helpdesk is regularly inundated with tickets about Excel, usually along the lines of 'Excel is freezing or crashing'. It's almost every case, it can be narrowed down to a few standard culprits:
  
3rd Party Add-in (for us it's an add-in that pulls data from our ERP - Dynamics or JDE)
 Spreadsheets linked to 30 other spreadsheets, of which half the links are usually broken
 Macro or VB issues
 Some frankenstein spreadsheet with quarter-end balance info that's been in use since 1997.
  
Our finance team gets frustrated because they always come running to IT, but realistically there's little we can do, because 95% of the time it's not really an actual PC or app problem. We endlessly communicate this, but of course people come to see us regardless.
 We're thinking of implementing a policy of not being able to support Excel.
 Curious how you all handle 'those excel issues'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Having a debate with coworkers about Specops settings. We can ban dictionary words, but also set a minimum length for a passphrase. My assumption is that when the policy sees "Chocolate14$" it contains a dictionary word, and is not allowed, but if it sees "Ilikechocolatecake365!" then it sees it as a phrase. My coworkers contend that the presence of any dictionary word means the password is non-compliant, so the passphrase setting is conflicting and useless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone. There is a Dell Precision tower that has ubuntu loaded on it and is used by our developers. Someone tried updating cuda and it basically caused the SSD to not boot to the OS. A ton of error messages appeared. To make a long story short, I went into recovery mode, removed all NVIDIA drivers, cleaned it and booted to the OS with no problem. Once we rebooted the machine again, it reverted back to the previous state of not booting to the OS and now I'm not able to get to the recovery mode. I ran a ton of commands and can't get to recovery mode or to the login screen. So what I did was imaged another SSD and removed the old one. 
 My question is, is there a way for me to get the data off of the old SSD and load it onto the newer SSD? There are a few very specific files they're wanting off of the old SSD, which will save them time in recreating everything from scratch. ORR would it be ok to connect the old SSD as a secondary drive and they get to the files from there while the tower boots to the newer SSD??? I'm just trying to figure out the best way to go about this and I'm by far not great with Ubuntu; it's too sensitive..lol. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, you're my (pretty much) last resort as I am looking for a solution to this problem for quite some time now.
 Our small non-profit currently does not have dedicated E-Mail adresses, our members use their own (personal) E-Mail adresses (gmail, yahoo, you name it). I've set up some forwarding e-mails, e.g. finances@ourdomain.com to the personal adresses of our members. This is not the best solution since every position is occupied with at least two persons and everyone gets a copy of the E-Mail. In total we are talking about around 10-14 people/users and a total of around 6 shared inboxes.
 The next step was looking for an MS Exchange with shared inboxes and automapping to outlook. We cannot use the official O365 due to GDPR restrictions of our governing body and would have to use an on-premise solution. Microsoft does not allow for shared inboxes on mobile devices under on-premise hosting. All the available workarounds I found online (enabling insecure IMAP connections, enabling the deactivated user in the Exchange panel) are not allowed by either the hosting company or violate Microsoft licensing terms.
 So the next thought was several IMAP accounts. No usually as an admin, I'd have to give the shared account credentials to everyone involved. I stumbled upon the Nextcloud Mail App which allows for multiple mail accounts, maybe that's a solution. I've already posted this idea in the /r/Nextcloud subreddit.
 Do you have an idea concerning this matter? All in all, I want several users to connect to the same mailbox via their personal PCs (they use Outlook there) and their mobile devices (they either use a Mail App of their choice or I could talk them into using a separate app if neccessary).
 I'm really at loss here, hoping to get some ideas :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the past few weeks we have noticed odd behaviour with MS more specifically EXO. Our latest complaint is safe emails are now all of the sudden going into quarantine. We are a mortgage company and our users do business with many 3rd parties. Emails were flowing with out issue up until recently. Communication between our users and external 3parties starts out as it should, then for some reason the detection methods go crazy and quarantines the emails. Its becoming a headache to monitor the quarantine, release and report/submit false positives to MS. In the past 30 days we have submitted over 500 emails as false positives. On the MS doc for Secure by Default, it states that this cannot be turned off by admins. And the percentage rate is low for false positives. I dis believe this as we are seeing a high impact. I have done some tweaking by adding these domains to safe senders list but this has little resolve as some of the messages are marked as High Conf Phish. While reviewing the report in quarantine for these emails nothing is being marked as a threat - attachments, urls or images . All pass. No campaign or other indicators except for "Advanced Filter technology". I have turned off "mailbox intelligence" in the filters but that has done nothing. I have opened a ticket with MS and its going no where fast. I have even shared the article they have published on Secure by Default and highlighted that part where it states safe emails are being marked as phishing. Anyone else experiencing this headache?

As you can imagine, in that environment, the average lifetime of a tablet is not great. The other gotcha is that I am remote and have been setting these tablets up for him remotely - He connects them to the shop floor wifi, I do the rest.
 So what I'm looking for is some software (Free, paid, whatever) so that I can create a master image from one of these freshly set up tablets and then either write that to USB or maybe deploy via PXE (Not sure if the tablets can even have their boot order changed, so that may not be possible). If there is some software that can create a "Plug in the usb stick and walk away" image, that would be best as he's highly non-technical.

I imagine something like setting up some network boot environment as I have enough space for connecting some 20-40 laptops at once and boot them up. After performing the diagnostics I should have a saved report somewhere. Also if there is an option for wiping the laptop would be a big plus. As always, if it's open source, it would be better.
 I don't seem to be able to find anything useful and I would appreciate your input on this. Thanks!

 So i have some drives encrypted with truecrypt. Haven't uses the drives for a couple of months, but have the password written down somewhere
 I connected the drives to my windows 10 pc
 Tried login in with password... says it it's wrong
 Started to look for some information, some are saying, when this is happening, the partition could be damage
 After a while of thinking, i tried something i did not find, my partitions does not have any letters, but can been seen in any partition program, my solution to get truecrypt accept my password was following
  
Open diskmanagment
 Selectet your hidden drives and add letters to the drives
 Then a pop up windows says the drive needs to be formatting, ignore that, close down pop up window
  Remove the letters you added to your hidden drives
  Now you should be able access your hidden drives through truecrypt
  
At least my drives wasen't damaged
 But why did true crypt not find my hidden partitions in the first place? It did months before?

Yesterday I was chatting with a friend whose company just signed an agreement to lease 300+ desktops for 3 years and he shared that the agreement stipulated they had to return the equipment in the original boxes at the end of the lease. It still blows my mind a little and I've been processing it for almost 24 hours.
 Is this kind of requirement a normal thing in equipment lease agreements? If so, is it something vendors actually enforce? If so, how in the hell do companies store hundreds or thousands of boxes with packing materials for years? It sounds wildly impractical to deal with this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been discussing this with Mimecast themselves and they keep redirecting us to the Blocked Sender and DNS Authentication policies.
 What we are trying to determine if possible is, can we configure Mimecast in such a way that it would choose to honour a DMARC policy that has hold or reject configured, but have it ignore any policy with a none option set and then apply our own override?
 I can appreciate the issues this is going to potentially cause with valid business email being blocked as not everyone has DMARC correctly configured (hell, our sister companies don't!), but we are looking at this as purely a technical discussion right now. Mimecast's solution is to have manual intervention and have us manage the blocked senders list by adding domains in response to events such as a phishing attack. That's not a valid solution for us. We are discussing and looking for a purely automated solution here.

 I built DATA CENTER with central DC's VM that holds the DNS services and the RDS license services, and under it, I made all the VM's with Tree Trusted Domain (with realm Trust Type). Each VM gets its RDS license from the DC directly (through GPO redirect to the RDS license server's IP); sometimes, the VM drop from the RDS license server; I should enter the Remote Desktop Licensing Diagnoser, renew the connection to the RDS license server, and resupply the credentials!
 How can I reserve the connection to the RDS server? Is there any other method that can resolve my issue?
 Do I have to add a universal group with RDSadmins that can cross the trusted forest, and which appropriate's group should it be in the DC server?
 Thanks

 So we are using Aurora MySQL for our production.
 Once in a while, we need to manually do some data manipulations in the database. In these cases, one of the approved senior engineers who has privilege log in to a production container and run the queries required. Users who log in to the production environment are logged and recorded, however, there is no record of what they did. Maybe they did some data manipulation or maybe not. But there is no way to know it.
 How do you guys record these? Or what is the best practice for cases when manual data manipulation is required?
 Cheers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m extremely frustrated , please excuse my rant. I joined IT pretty late in my life, was 29 when I landed my first Helpdesk gig, 1.5 years later got headhunted by Microsoft to join their Helpdesk, made it to manager in 3 years from agent to supervisor then manager and yesterday got served my 3 month notice for redundancy. I’m based in the UK and I’m seriously disappointed. My comanager was barely around (constantly disappearing, never showing up to the office to look after his kids, taking weeks of sick leave) so I had to pick up on his slack and do the work of 2 full time managers. Even though we report to the same manager, I complained about him several times but my manager said there’s nothing she could do thanks to employee rights. Me being me, I constantly worked 10 hours a day as well as evenings, weekends, took my work laptop with me while I was on vacation to Spain and Cyprus. People see my success and obsessive nature but I sacrificed a lot, my girlfriend left me, I’m the fattest I’ve ever been, my cholesterol levels are through the roof and I’ve developed extremely painful haemorrhoids to where I almost passed out from the pain in the office bathroom. I get out of breath when tying my shoe lace! Now on top of everything I’ve been made redundant. 
 I don’t have anything left in the tank to do anything more, I bombed my last interview as a manager for a fintech company and with only 1 years managerial experience it’s doubtful I’ll get another manager gig. So by the end of all this I’ve ended up a sad fat lonely burnt out idiot who sacrificed literally everything to get to absolutely nowhere. Argh!!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Was doing some reading on VLAN 0 and how it's a tag that gets applied to traffic requiring CoS but is not associated with a VLAN. Then it got me thinking: what traffic aside from switch-generated traffic (ie: STP, CDP, etc.) wouldn't actually get tagged across a trunk anyway? According to Cisco:
  
A switch may also have to send untagged traffic across a trunk link. Untagged traffic is generated by a switch and may also come from legacy devices. The 802.1Q trunk port places untagged traffic on the native VLAN. The native VLAN on a Cisco switch is VLAN 1 (i.e., default VLAN).
  
So lets say a legacy device with a NIC driver that doesn't support VLAN tags is plugged into an Access Port. It sends traffic. An Access Port in a VLAN environment is always going to associate incoming traffic from an end device with a VLAN. To that point, wouldn't the traffic get tagged with that ID as it traverses a trunk port? What is it that's telling the switch to not apply a VLAN ID? There must be something, no?

We have two physical servers running Windows Server 2016 and 2019, both hosting Hyper-V VMs (<10 combined) in an AD environment. We also have a QNAP NAS for file storage. Given the following constraints, which is the least laughable option for backing up my VMs to the QNAP? (If not obvious from the below list, all are free options for me at the moment)
  
Using QNAP's built-in Hyper Data Protector tool
 Running Veeam Community on a separate, older Dell PowerEdge 1850 (would be spinning up as 3rd physical server)
 Running Veeam Community as a VM on one of the two Windows Servers
  
I'm currently backing them up using QNAP's HDP, which has been working fine. I'm a little nervous about its reliability and potential for vulnerabilities though, given it's not QNAP's main forte and they're not the most responsive to fixing them. I thought about trying out Veeam to see why everyone likes it so much. I know running on old hardware is a little risky, but I fear running it as a VM on the same hardware as the rest is riskier. If there's another free option I'm missing here that you'd recommend, I'd love to hear it.

However, in the first interview, the recruiter mentioned that he wanted someone to enjoy doing the work and doesn’t want a lazy person who just clocks in and clocks out and treats it as a 9-5 job.
 Should I just withdraw from the job posting rather than getting a rejection email? In my opinion, I felt disrespected and insulted because of this… Although I can take plenty of hits, the job workplace culture seemed toxic, especially because it’s just 2 employees the head of the department and a regular security analyst.

 Now whenever my company needs to connect our hardware to your network, IT inevitably must get involved.
 The biggest pushback is that my company’s hardware cannot be managed by the customers IT infrastructure whatsoever. (No domain joining, or any kind of endpoint protection). We expressly state in the purchase agreement that the equipment is managed and supported by my company.
 Our equipment is meant to be a single user device and has no need to contact the outside internet. Connecting to any network is only necessary for transferring the data collected. Technically, we have a samba server running on the equipment, and that single (or maybe the small group) of users have the credentials. 
 Would you then describe the equipment as an “appliance” (cannot be managed by policy)?
 Is this a common scenario in your company (you have an outside vendors equipment wanting to connect to your network)?
 What would you require (or assuage your security concerns) from the vendor? 
 In most cases I’ve told folks that they can secure the VLAN (firewalls, routing) by restricting what resources the equipment can access when connected to their network, but it seems like I have to go five levels deep in their organization to get this to happen.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm seeing several jobs advertising "On Call."
 While I know what the words mean, I cannot picture what an On call pay structure is like.
 Is it like being an Uber for helpdesk calls or something? Does it mean that you are paid per call, or for the hours that you are on call?
 Reason I ask is because I have a decent job in another field.. I desperatly want to get into IT and am willing to pay my dues.. but not go into bankruptcy for the first few years that I'd be entry level. My perfect situation would be a job that's 3-5 hours a day that I could work before or after my present job.
 I've tried part time.. what a joke. The part time positions want 40-45 hours a week.. they just claim part time to not pay benefits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, we have a situation where we have a CNX file that connects to a database in a specific folder. I attempted to modify this file by changing the database name and saved the CNX file. However, the saved CNX file still contained the old database name. To fix this issue, I deleted the original CNX file and attempted to create a new one. However, when I tried to save the new CNX file, the file editor showed that the CNX file already existed in the folder, even though I could not find the file in the folder. To investigate further, I created a new folder with the same name as the original folder. However, when I tried to create a new CNX file in the new folder, the file editor showed that a CNX file already existed in the empty folder.
 I am unsure why this issue is occurring, as I have checked APPDATA to ensure there are no old files causing the issue. Do you have any ideas as to what may be causing this problem?
 -Tried searching APPDATA for old information to delete -Deleted the old folder and created the same folder name, but this showed a ghost CNX file in the newly created folder.

 If you dont understand VMWare, its fine. Find someone who does. Dont assume taking a class for a week automatically makes you an expert.

A manager for the region in which I live asked if we had a technology vendor for disposal of equipment. I happen to have a desire to do this on the side and had started a very small website/advertisement in my area expressing this. I guess my question is: is there any danger in suggesting my own company as a vendor for my job? Much of the collection work can be outsourced so there’s no danger of anyone really seeing me collecting the equipment.

 All the servers here are Windows 2012 R2 and I'm familiar with Hyper-V, Active Directory, Group Policies, but I use the GUI for almost everything and know only a few basic Powershell commands. I was able to install and set up a pfSense firewall on a VM and during COVID I was able to set up a VPN server on it so that people could work remotely, but I just followed a YouTube tutorial on how to do it.
 I feel I only have a broad understanding of how everything works which usually allows me to figure out what I need to Google to find the specific solution, but it gives me deep imposter syndrome. Is there a certification I should go for or a test somewhere that I can take to see where I stand?
 I want to leave this company to make more money elsewhere, but before I start applying elsewhere, what skills should I brush up on that I would be expected to know? 
 Thanks.

 Wireless in the office is mainly for web surfing and emails and I deal with a lot of pt to pt wireless links for IP cameras in some remote work locations. The pt to pt links are under 1000 ft and as long as the radios are configured properly and have LOS they basically link up and work, but I don't understand 80% of the settings in the wireless radio settings.
 I'm not looking to become a wireless expert, but it seems that there is more to wifi than adding APs and moving closer to the AP. Yes, there is a thing as too many APs, I was just giving an example.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been studying up on MAC addresses recently, specifically the Universal/Local bit that Apple and Android take advantage of for MAC randomization.
 RFC 7042 says:
  
OUIs and longer MAC prefixes are assigned with the Local bit zero and the Group bit unspecified.
  
But seems to contradict itself one paragraph later.
  
If the Local bit is on, the holder of an OUI has no special authority over MAC identifiers whose first 3 octets correspond to their OUI.
  
In my mind, it only makes sense that all OUIs would be assigned with U/L bit set to 0, however I see many examples of OUIs that have the U/L bit set to 1:
  
02:C0:8C - 3COM
 02:70:B3 - DATA RECALL LTD.
 02:9D:8E - CARDIAC RECORDERS, INC.
 02:70:B0 - M/A-COM INC. COMPANIES
 AA:00:04 - DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION
 02:07:01 - RACAL-DATACOM
 AA-00-00 - DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION
 02:BB:01 OCTOTHORPE CORP.
  
... among others.
 Why is it that some OUIs have been assigned with the local bit set to 1? Is this just a mistake by the IEEE Registration Authority? Are addresses that start with these assigned OUI prefixes still LAAs or would they be considered UAAs? If I'm generating LAAs, do I need to avoid using these assigned OUI prefixes?

 I inherited this network, and sure enough I don’t have any internal information on it or what the running / startup config right now, I’ll need to console into the switch to see.
 I have some 2960’s around, but I’m a bit rusty here.
 It looks like it has 12.2(58)SE1-ip-serv-crypto running on it.
  
The “IP-Serv-Crypto” is the Layer 3 routing part of iOS? I’ll need to get a license for the 2960 and flash the new image to just to use one of my old switches on hand if what I’m assuming is correct. But that seems like it would be better to just acquire a new switch.
 
What would you guys / gals recommend if purchasing something new? I’m seeing the new “Cisco Business” stuff popping around.
 
 I appreciate any advice.
 Thanks!

 I know to measure convergence I need to send ping packets across the network. (Do I count the packet loss as convergence?). can I do this with wireshark (I have no idea how to use it but I've watched a few youtube videos)
 for packet loss, i think I can figure it out with wireshark. however any other help is welcomed 
 how do i measure delay?
 please help!

Additionally, our boss would like to be able to access the data and create a backup on an external drive or something. We are part of the maintenance team, but we are not experts in this device, and we were asked to create backups using just the manuals as guidance. We have tried using snapshots and copying volumes, but those methods do not meet the requirement of having a backup that can be accessed from other devices like an external drive (since it only creates a snapshot or volume copy in the disks that belong to disk groups within the same MSA). So the question would be, how can we make this? Is there a way or is it just what it is?
 We know that in case of a disk failure the spares will take over and replace the degraded one, but that it not enough for our boss, he is convinced everything will break at the same time and we will end up losing ALL the data.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As I'm moving through my journey being a lower-level Technician currently dealing with break-fix, I'm starting to find myself involved with a few more projects. How does everyone deal with the first stages of a request/demand? 
 Generally, a break-fix case is straightforward in that something is broken and you need to weed out information about the problem to fix it. Most systems are already in place, nothing new (generally) needs to be built/designed, or implemented. Anything new is usually ephemeral, required only for the duration of the troubleshooting, and generally doesn't have the same "will this scale" scrutiny applied. 
 I'm struggling to a degree with the Project side of things where you effectively get a wall of text from a Customer (Requirements, Demands, current/future state, Access required) all jumbled up into a little story with a whole heap of pleasantries, and thinking about how I break this down into something I can track, how I can assign or verify certain pieces with other teams, etc. 
 Right off the bat, Emails and Tickets are a task at breaking down possibly hundreds of small subtasks and requests into something that can be actioned (Intertwined with spelling/grammar and sometimes confusing sentences). 
 How does everyone do it? Do you start with kick-off meetings first, do you try to break down their initial correspondence into something like Trello or Excel and track all of the different points? Does anyone have a system for taking requests, pondering on them for a bit and effectively getting tasks/deliverables and questions from them to progress a project?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All!
 I'm quite new to IP transit and Peering but I have a few questions and if you could confirm if my understanding is correct?
 ​
 #IP Transit
 IP Transit would be to access the provider's peers, So for example, if I was with HE, I could connect to Comcast customers but not Comast's peers? 
 However, Arelion shows additional peers on the BGP Report? Which means I could also connect to GTT customers?
 ​
 #Peering
 Peering wise, I know peering with content providers like Netflix can be highly beneficial, however, how does it work if you peer with an IP transit provider?
 ​
 So if I peered with HE, I would be able to connect to their customers but not their peers, so no connection to Comcast customers? 
 ​
 #Peering Customers
 Customer-wise, would that be companies that have gotten IP transit with HE?
 If I'm peering with HE that means to connect to me via HE you would need their IP transit? So would I be considered a peer of HE or is it more complicated?
 ​
 Is that the case for most IP transit providers that offer peering? 
 I'm not sure if there are some providers that may only peer their own ASN but require IP Transit to reach the rest of their network or customers on their IP transit service.

 Note, I have found a way to prefill the registration page with data via registry (HKEY Local User). Not the best answer but at least they would only have to hit 1 button. Anything that we can do before install or before issues a system would be appreciated. It does require it per user login at this time, but only once.

 Im looking at MDM solutions for a company about 120 machines, and Im interested in putting it in the mix to see pricing/features, but for the life of me, I cannot find it. I swore I saved it in Reddit, but cannot find it after searching for 20 minutes. 
 Hoping someone can point me in the right direction on this, as I want to give them a fair shake.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm one of two IT employees at a small company. In terms of Employees we have probably about 75 and PC's about the same amount.
 We are looking into an IT Ticketing/Service Management system because as of right now we have no system to speak of. When users have issues, they come get us, and with the amount of work starting to pick up, it's starting to become an issue
 The main features that we are looking for are
  
A Ticketing system (pretty self explanatory)
 A system with some sort of knowledge base so we can centralize our Documentation
 Asset Management to keep track of all hardware that we manage
 Some sort of remote assistance tool that isn't VPN/RDP based. (We have multiple sets over an hour apart and it become a real pain when we need to do any sort of support to the other site)
  
What's the best way to go about getting all of the features? is there any system/software that has these features(but wont break the bank)? 
 Would it make more sense or be more cost effective if we were to look for multiple tools to do all of these things?
 ​
 I've worked with TopDesk before at a previous job, but that's about it for experience with these systems
 Any ideas would be appreciated, Thanks!

 I can't decide how to design the network in a new office. I am going to designate entire /16 for it, but I can't decide how to carve out specific subnets. I'm thinking of doing something like:
 VLAN 10 - 10.50.10.0/23
 VLAN 20 - 10.50.20.0/24
 VLAN 30 - 10.50.30.0/24
 and so on. I can't yet decide whether it's a stupid idea to let subnets follow VLAN tags, and to left out such big chunks unassigned and unused, or whether I should go with my gut feeling and just do what feels natural and easy to manage overall. I'm the sole administrator here. We will hire more people for 1st line support in the future, so I'm keen to keep things simple and descriptive.
 I've always been supporting what's already there, adding things into existing environments setup by people before me. I've never had an opportunity like that, to setup a completely new office from the ground up, so I feel paralysed by the sheer number of possibilities. I am clearly overthinking this, I know.

 I know this is a long shot but maybe the solution is right in front of my eyes.
 I need to evaluate the number of links needed to interconnect my X routers. While I want to minimize the number of links, I want to be sure that there is a shortest path of at most Y hops and a backup path of at most Y+Z hops.
 I use variables (X, Y and Z) so I can simulate multiple scenarios.
 I have been trying to implement that on NetworkX but cannot find the right way to do it. I suppose it needs a mathematician's brain that I do not have.
 How would you solve this problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello sysadmins,
 I have an issue I can't seem to figure out. My org had an On-Prem Exchange server that they decommissioned several years back (before my time) when they moved to a hybrid Azure environment. All mail is Exchange Online now.
 When they started syncing users to Azure/O365, they left many of the current employees with a "company.local" UPN Suffix, as opposed to "company.com." They also left all the msExch* attributes in tact.
 I recently implemented Conditional Access policies for MFA, and they wanted employees on site to be able to use a Hybrid-Joined computer in lieu of the MFA verification.
 So I set that up, but we discovered that it didn't work for some users. I found that it was due to the "company.local" UPN discrepancy between local AD and Azure (which had "company.com" as the Azure UPN). I switch the suffix and it fixed the CA issue.
 Director says to move everyone to the correct suffix to make it work, so I did that. Since the UPN's match, every user's msExch attributes are linked correctly in Exchange Online. 
 Users now show this error in the admin.microsoft.com portal, under their Mail tab: This user's on-premises mailbox hasn't been migrated to ‎Exchange Online‎. The ‎Exchange Online‎ mailbox will be available after migration is completed.
 These user's already had a mailbox, and it seems that most of them have no issues using mail still. We did have one user who's mailbox disappeared, I removed the msExchMailboxGuid and other related attributes from their local AD account, and had to remove and reassign their Exchange Online license. This created a new mailbox for them, but it is a fresh mailbox and does not have any previous mail in it.
 I changed the Sync Rules in AD Connect to push NULL out for the msExchMailboxGuid for all users, and it did sync the NULL value for everyone. But the error is still there over a day later.
 Is there any way to resolve this without losing everyone's mailbox?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, 
 Looking for a bit of confirmation on something I am trying to resolve with regards to DNS. A number of FW vendors (Fortinet, Cisco, Palo etc) offer a feature where a DNS record can be inspected that the reply amended to provide a different result, for example to give an internal client a different IP address. 
 I am trying to understand which vendors support the translation of the additional records field within an SRV record. It looks like all can successfully translate A records etc. 
 With an SRV record, it will usually contain in the answer an FQDN in the reply. As the FQDN needs to be resolved anyway, rather than wait for the requestor to send another A-Record translation request the SRV record will often pre-empt this and include the response to the A-Record lookup in its additional records data. (So even though the client hasn't expressly asked for it, it gets given it anyway)
 Particular interest in Cisco ASA - anyone know if the ASA can translate the information that is presented in the additional records field of DNS?
 Cheers

 I am currently trying to pass 5 NVMe disks to a storage VM as a passthrough device. Unfortunately, I can't find the right option in the BIOS that allows this. The NVMes are attached to this controller: "HPE MR416i-a Gen10+". Of course I didn't create a logical drive and the disks are marked as JBODs.
 I know from an old server that you can mark the NVMe as PT-Enabled and then you can select it as a PCI device in the VM settings.
 Does anyone have any idea what the appropriate setting is and where to find it? Thank you very much!
 Regards,
 Chris

 I'm sorry for what might seem like a dumb question. 
 In my day to day work I make tools for myself in python to make my job more easy and efficient and in some cases enjoyable. some of my coworkers have seen some of these tools and asked to get the tools as well.
 In the past it has not been an issue to use something like autopytoexe to convert my script to an executable that my colleagues could use but as security becomes a bigger concern restrictions on user machines naturally becomes stricter, something, I'm all for.
 However one of these restrictions is that antivirus now has gone from "I recognize this software as a virus because x,y,z" to "I don't recognize this software as a safe software".
 I understand this move completely as it makes it more difficult to obscure your virus, even if it confuses me a little bit that it doesn't treat excel macro's and bat files the same (I mean I know exactly why but I find the compromise frustrating).
 Is there a smart way to legitimize a piece of software I wrote for a small team of about 30 people without compromising security or teaching the users that "it's ok to open exe files as long as its from someone I trust"?
 Submitting the software for review with our antivirus provider and Microsoft is time consuming and expensive, and I have some concern with installing python on users machines.
 I could make some of the tools web accessible but that adds significant development time and a tool made to start with windows and remind you to stand up once in a while wouldn't work as a web application.

 ​
  
7 = Notify for install and notify for restart. (Windows Server only)
 With this option from Windows Server 2016, applicable only to Server SKU devices, local administrators will be allowed to use Windows Update to proceed with installations or reboots manually.
  
Forgive me for being stupid, but my Google searches arent throwing up the reference material im after. From reading it seems that this is specific to 2016 and Im guessing the reason I dont see this option is because my domain is aging (2012 functional level) and we're only getting round to upgrading OS's now SO perhaps the relevant ADMX files arent there. 
 This stems from an unexplained reboot relating to windows updates on a test 2016 VM - we've been advised to use option 7 ... so I wanted to test this to see what it looks like.
 Id be grateful for a reference to back this up?

 Users are able to create folders in "C:\Users\username\tenant", and these folders show in the company folder in the OneDrive client, but they're not synced. Users can store a ton of documents there and expect them to be backuped, etc.
 Any way to block or disable this?

 Firewalls are 2x Watchguard M270 Switches are 2x USW-PRO-24
 I am not a network admin so I am a bit out of my depth, I think I am on the right track but I would like a sanity check
 A crude drawing of my setup here:
 https://i.imgur.com/1ztQUCX.png
 Currently my setup is as above with the exception of the green coloured lines/X, what I want to do is wire up so my switches are fully redundantly connected with the firewalls, as I currently have servers connected to the switches but if SWITCH1 dies we lose internet/VLAN routing.
 So, in short:
  
add new interface to watchguard cluster (so one new port on each FW)
 connect both of those ports to SWITCH2
 delete the current line between SWITCH1 and SWITCH2
  
Would love some input if this looks alright or if I am about to create a loop and what I should do instead.

 We're trying out CodeTwo's MS365 signatures and I'm going to have to update everybody's profile info so that the placeholders can be populated on the signatures. I don't want to update all the info within Azure AD and then preform a sync from on-prem at a later date and have it all wiped out (is that correct?)
 Currently there is no sync between our on-prem AD Servers (2) and Azure.
 I was going to setup the Azure AD Cloud Sync but had a few questions I need help with:
  
Am I correct in saying that the sync is 1-way only, on-prem to Azure? So I make all changes on-prem?
 Will there be any interference with our MS365 email accounts once the initial sync has completed, as we use different passwords for AD and Emails.
 Any other gotcha's I need to watch out for? 
  
Thank you.

Since SSD was only a cache for read-only data, all of the data should be on the HDD just fine. But I cannot figure out how to get to it. The data is available in offside backup, so no big deal if it's impossible, but would be great to avoid the pain of restoring a massive remote backup, given that all the data should be on the hdd.

The camera spec says 15w max and says PoE 802.3af as well. The camera power lights just come on dimly and fade out every few seconds like it's not getting enough power on the small switches but as far as I know, they are rated for the same spec as the Cisco. I run a few security cameras off both small switches so I don't know what's different about the Cisco over the other switches. The only thing I can think of is that the Cisco might be sending power before negotiation completes or the small ones have some issue negotiating and don't deliver power long enough for it to complete.

 Directly in Windows you can choose English European which does this correct, are there a similar language in Edge?

 We have a system that is published as a bunch of RemoteApps on RDS server.
 It was requested to be built for our own users, and is working fine for that purpose.
 Now they have requested another external company gain access to this system as well.
 Any suggestions on how to solve this task? I can't imagine creating AD users for every employee from the other company and allowing them access that way through.
 RemoteApps and RDS servers is not a field I'm very familiar with, so I don't know what options I have. I have heard about Azure AD Application Proxy before, could that be a solution or is that for something else entirely?
 Best regards.

After joining, everything was going well. I was getting used to work culture, learning their procedures and after a month or two, I had a pretty good handle on things. In fact, I was able to learn/understand a lot of processes/tools without proper training or documentation. According to my manager "I am grasping everything very well" and he was pretty happy with my work here. 
 A month and a half after joining, my manager resigned and my teammate(same level and working 8 months longer than me in the company) became the lead and his attitude changed drastically after becoming my manager. Yesterday he told me I had to inform him if I am off my desk even for 5 minutes 🤯 anyway We are now only 2 people in the team. Him & me. We manage helpdesk and infrastructure. 
 A week ago I asked him if I can start work half an hour early and finish early only on Mondays so that I can take my 11-month-old kid to swimming classes. I thought it was simple request and out of nowhere he told me NO because as a helpdesk/sysadmin team, we are supposed to support 9 to 5. I agreed with him and asked if he can cover for the last 30 minutes and again, the answer was NO. 
 So today I set up a meeting and asked the same thing to the senior manager and he told me "because we had a couple of departures from our team, he can't give me that flexibility. And there are no plans to hire anyone anytime soon." 
 I mean, 2 people already left in last 2 months (my manager and another colleague), are you ready to lose another just for this one small request?(I guess they are lol)
 Anyways I guess it's time to start looking for another job. tbh, in my 10 years of career, I never had to choose between my family and my job. I always thought teammates help when needed.
 TL;DR: workplace indirectly asked me to choose between family and job

 Currently we have some servers that require starting applications up after a restart or verification that the application did not break after windows updates. This also includes taking snapshots.
 Due to that we are updating some servers manually and it takes quite some time to do it after hours. 
 Is this just a grin and bear it solution if the vendor doesn't have a way to automate the task?
 The only half solution I can think of is to schedule snapshots and schedule updates and then still do the manual portion before opening hours rather than after. I just wonder if most people work this way or if servers needing touched after restarts are less common.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Right now in our environment it is a choatic mess with printers...everyone has their own weird printer, from small epsons, canons, lexmark etc., you name it, on top of our huge Konica Minoltas and Epson C20600 (At least I think it is by epson iirc, I'd have to look at the notes I took again).
 As these printers die out I want to eventually bring in brother printers since I have heard good things about them, but I'm not sure how we should have our setup work.
 What I mean is, we spend so much money in various inks and it is a mess, outside of the ones we have auto managed for our surgery center.
 I was thinking that in order to save money, we have specific locations that have their own small printers, and perhaps incorporate large ones for regular workers like our call center and MA's area.
 But I also heard that having everyone get up and having to go get their stuff can cause delays with patients etc.
 What do you guys think? There's got to be a way to slowly move us in the direction of unity where everyone has the same brand, and also not spend thousands of dollars for all these different inks??
 At a loss on this one and I would love senior opinions from those more experienced than me.
 I appreciate it!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I posted this question 5 years ago. Looking to see how answers have changed.
 IPv6 was published as a standard in December 1998. With the 30th anniversary approaching, what has shaken out to be the most accepted way of assigning Addresses in an enterprise environment? 
  
SLAAC + RDNSS
 SLAAC with DHCPv6 for for Domain info
 DHCPv6 with SLAAC only for RA
  
(Yes, I know that Android is still not on the DHCPv6 train, but Windows is on the RDNSS train now, so major changes have happened in the last 5 years.)
 I know the NSA has published a document this January with the following:
 "NSA recommends assigning addresses to hosts via a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 (DHCPv6) server to mitigate the SLAAC privacy issue. Alternatively, this issue can also be mitigated by using a randomly generated interface ID (RFC 4941 – Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Auto-configuration in IPv6) [1] that changes over time, making it difficult to correlate activity while still allowing network defenders requisite visibility " 
 So how are you guys handling address assignment?

So user "jdoe" would be a regular user, but "jdoe-a" would have Administrator rights.
 The thinking is that you could not log into a machine as "jdoe-a", but you can log in as "jdoe" and when it prompts for an Administrator password to escalate privileges for something, the user could think first and then enter "jdoe-a" credentials if appropriate.
 Is this advisable? How can I accomplish this with AD Users and Computers and/or Group Policy?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! 
 I'm trying to develop a proof of concept for something and it begins with using a virtual Sonicwall Nv270 hosted in azure, and creating an IPSec VPN tunnel interface between the NSv and a remote site.
 I created this VM in line with the Sonicwall best practice which includes using the Marketplace template to stand it up.
 The remote site in question is a Cradlepoint IBR900 Cellular router. We've used a lot of these devices in other deployments - Including - Scenarios where we've deployed physical Sonicwalls in customer data centers and had IPsec tunnels to between them.
 The Azure VM is running Linux CentOS and it has a Public IP which is then bound to the virtual network WAN interface X1 which also has a private IP. 
 The Sonicwall isn't aware if it's Public IP - The WAN Interface X1 has an IP of 10.1.0.4 and sends traffic out the internet to its DFGW of 10.1.0.1 - I cannot change the WAN Interface IP nor the DFGW which I find really odd. 
 I have by default an NSG inside Azure which I've setup to allow traffic sourced from the Cradlepoint's public IP on ports 50, 51, 500 and 4500.
 I have created on both the sonicwall and the cradlepoint, a VTI and triple checked all of the configuration for Phase 1 and Phase 2 to ensure it matches.
 On the Sonicwall, I can see traffic coming from the CP on it's public IP on the allowed ports and the reverse leaving the firewall.
 I do not have an Azure VPN Gateway set up - I wanted to set this up without it if it's possible due to some limitations with it.
 I'm quite green with Azure so I'm trying my best to get something basic working but having difficulties. If you need further information, please let me know.

 I've noticed that large public Wi-Fi networks tend to have an IP configuration similar to this:
 Network: aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd/30 (I've seen segments from 28 to 30)
 Gateway: aaa.bbb.ccc.1 (default gateway is in any IP from segment 23)
 I just wanted to ask if anyone of you have deployed large campus wi-fi networks and know why this is the case. I have some theories of my own:
  
Helps with client isolation.
 Helps with bandwidth management, where you assign certain bandwidth capacity to each subnet.
 ??? (I just don't know what else could be the cause of this).

There's a few articles out there but somehow I still always had issues like NPS sending Access-Accept, switch logs showing successful login, but it would immediately disconnect me.
 This time I decided to document what I learned so that others might benefit.. i.e me in a few years when I forget again :)
 Switch config:
 ssh server enable radius scheme NPS primary authentication 1.2.3.4 primary accounting 1.2.3.4 key authentication simple MY-PSK-HERE key accounting simple MY-PSK-HERE user-name-format without-domain domain MYDOMAIN authentication login radius-scheme NPS local authorization login radius-scheme NPS local accounting login radius-scheme NPS local domain default enable MYDOMAIN line vty 0 63 authentication-mode scheme user-role network-admin user-role network-operator protocol inbound ssh idle-timeout 600 0 
 NPS
 --Network Policies ----Constraints ------Authentication Methods Uncheck all except for PAP. PAP required. ----Settings ------Vendor Specific Add an attribute "Cisco-AV-Pair" Add attribute value and enter " shell:roles=network-admin " 
 Obviously this is not a complete guide. This assumes you know how to set up NPS/radius generally. This is just the hang ups.

 Has anyone connected a Sophos XGS Firewall with the cellular modem add-on to the Telus cellular network in Canada? If so, what plan were you able to use with Telus? Also, what settings did you have to provide them in order to get the unit connected?
 Typically Telus will want the IMEI of the mobile device getting connected but I'm not able to find that anywhere in the Sophos XGS interface for the cell WAN connection. 
 Any advice or recommendations would be much appreciated!

 How you guys manage your Linux devices of WFH workforce?
 We have a whole Development team that works from home and uses Linux devices. Something about 15 devices. And, sadly, we don't manage any aspect of this devices. We're in the dark with it. 
 With Windows devices, we use Defender for Endpoint + Intune, to manage and protect. But for Linux, we don't have anything yet. 
 Have any of you used some solution of WSL or Cloud PC to this use case? Or any other solution?
 How it worked out? What was your solutions to this kind of problem? 
 The whole Dev team is remote, so it's hard to keep control of the devices, considering that they don't have any technician to help them out. 
 Thanks folks :)

 We would like to have 2FA authentication and in the best case a SSO with our azure credentials, does anyone have a recommendation or idea on how to get the app proxy working without having a on-prem ad?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Straight forward process:
  
You send the group a meeting request
  
 You have to say who you want in the meeting
 You have to have an agenda
 You have to justify WHY you need each person. Saying they report to "so and so" is NOT a reason.
  
When the meeting group gets the request they will vet it and see if your meeting is actually needed. If it isn't, then they will state the reason why and alternatives that you can do to get the result you need without having a meeting. EVERYONE is subjected to this - even the CEO
 If you try to go around them and host a meeting without their consent - you get sent to HR and they will handle things. You could lose the right to host a meeting, get written up, get a warning or even you could lose your job over this. This includes getting someone else to host the meeting for you when you have been told you are not allowed to host a meeting.
 After the meeting, ALL the folks who attended will be sent a survey to grade the meeting. This is used by the meeting group to grade the host. If the host keeps getting low scores, they are sent to training on how to host a meeting correctly. If they keep getting low scores after that, they are banned from hosting meetings.
 Meetings are by far the worst money waster in a company. Imagine how much could be done if pointless meetings could be eliminated.

 The question is, if the timeout in source address persistence profile is set relatively high (for example 8 hours ) how crticial can this become regarding to memory of the BigIP.
 If there are for example 1M entries (for 1M different source IPs) in the persistent table, does this effect perfomance ?
 Already tried 'tmsh show sys memory | grep -i "subsystem\|persist"' but thats not realy helpful.

Set the GPO "Allow non-administrators to receive update notifications" beneath Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Windows Update to disabled (not supported for Windows 10 and so I assume also Server 2016)
 Set the GPO "Remove access to use all Windows Update features" beneath Computer Configuration/Administrative Templates/Windows Components/Windows Update to enabled (valid for Server 2016)
 The same GPO beneath User Configuration set to Enabled and "Configure notifications:" set to "0 - Do not show any notifications" (not supported on Windows 10)
  
Is disabling automatic updates the only solution to this problem? (not tested yet)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As my title states. When you have a HA Firewall set to Active-Passive, the passive firewall only comes online in the event of a failure of some sort, even if the active firewall is running at full capacity. Meaning one should configure for Active-Active if you want to achieve load balancing capabilities and reduce latency during high levels of utilization, is my understanding correct?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Hoping to get some help with my current policy configuration.
 Basically, MFA is enforced (enrolment required and security info registration locked-down to trusted network) but I can't seem to get SIF working on Wi-Fi and I'm prompted immediately when disconnecting from ethernet.
 SIF is the only session control enabled on the "MFA Enforced" policy but not sure why I'm still being prompted after disconnecting from LAN (trusted location). SIF is set to 60 days and I can sign-in again (going through the standard MFA process, also not seeing the "Don't ask again" option which is a good sign) but I'll get prompted for MFA again if I join and then leave the LAN same day.
 Wi-Fi public IP is shared with other tenancies in the building so I won't add that to trusted locations but I'd still like SIF to apply regardless of location.
 Been scouring forums but can't find cases where they're configuring for trusted locations.
 TL;DR - No MFA prompt when on trusted network, MFA prompt immediately when not on trusted network even though SIF is set to 60 days.
 TIA

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys
 Hope someone can help us out as we have made a terrible mistake in our team.
 We have a task for every 3 months to reset the krbtgt password twice inside our domain. Normally we would do this like recommended to wait for 24h before doing the second reset and then go our ways until the 3 months mark has been reached. Never had a problem for years. Now today it happened. I reset the password yesterday in the evening and scheduled the second reset for tomorrow as there normally would be no harm to do that even a day afterwards as long as we wait said 24. well what happened. The second admin new to our environment started the second reset this morning thinking that I did not do the first reset today in the morning and now we cannot access our DCs, nor any other server which only allows admin access to them. 
 I saw that one would need to restart every server and afterwards all clients which connect to the domain. Is this true? Or should we already plan for the a recovery plan? Any help would be appreciated.

Only some emails, and the example I was shown this morning is fairly long chain with some screenshots in it. She got her collegue to print it and it worked fine. But her's, once the print window appears, that's it, print preview is blank, it says connecting to printer but it's frozen.
 I've tried:
  
Changing default printer
 Saving attachment to desktop and opening and printing from there
 Outlook in safe mode
 Enabling IE mode in Edge
 Making sure .mht is associated with Edge
 Online Office repair
 Made sure Outlook trust settings aren't set to automatically download
 Removing the outlprnt file
  
None of the above made anyu difference. 
 I did try it from OWA, when I opened the email, hit print, it came straight up fine. Then I noticed it was blocking some content, so I allowed that, hit print, it took about 30sec for the print window to load but it did then work fine. 
 I'm thinking broken link or something like that, but I'm not sure what else to try?

 My question was basically that does the firewall software limit users to 20 or is it unlimited but the company advertises it as 20 for declared performance? ( even if performance drops with more users it would not affect my 100Mbps right??)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How do you go about preparing systems, if they involve accounts that use an Authenticator app?
 We often set up new systems with all fine details and settings on our own, which are then shipped to the end user so that they can get right back to work with their new system.
 In the past the users gave us their current passwords once and changed it after the work was done. 
 Now Microsoft 365 requires a 2FA on the basis of an authentication app (Microsoft or third-party), which means that we have to go to the user every time we need to sign in, so that they can give us the necessary PINs. 
 Since Microsoft 365 requires a new login quite frequently during setup, it can then happen that we have to keep pestering the users over 1-3 days, our work gets held up if we can't reach them, etc.
 Have you found a solution and a reasonable workflow for this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, I am having bandwidth issues and after many tests I am now clueless so I'm hoping you'll come up with fresh ideas...
 So here's the main issue : using the VPN from home, we have a download speed of 1.5MB/s which is low given the VPN concentrator and infrastructure we have (from the office using the VPN, the download speed is ~30MB/s).
 But this low speed is mainly due to the link/path speed which is low even without using a VPN (8Mo/s). But I can't understand why I can only reach 8Mo/s on this link (downloading a file from home to the office WITHOUT VPN).
 What I can't explain is that the upload speed from the office to a Cloud Server (mega.nz or weTransfer) uses almost the same path but the upload speed is much better ~20+MB/s (and speedtest.net shows ~500Mbps).
 Here's a recap of all the tests I have done so far (no VPN). Know that the speed tests were done with 2 different devices to be sure it's not device related (2 file servers, 2 home office computers in different locations, etc..).
 My only guess so far is that it could be due to MTU / packet fragmentation but I don't see where would this fragmentation happen. Could they have different policies depending on the flow type (TCP established)? That would explain why Office -> Internet upload speed and Internet -> Office download speed (= same flow source / direction) are different but I don't see why they would do that?
 Thanks in advance and have a great day!

 On Exchange online you can just turn it on and off manually. Idea is that i want to make it less of a chore and automate this. For example turn on forwarding emails from user1 to user2 from datetime1 to datetime2.
 Idea is to use scheduler on server and run two scripts. One for turning on and one for turning off. Maybe some kind of gui that create two scripts base on use input and after the second script run, both tasks are deleted?
 Any idea how to proceed with this?

 I tried reporting Zayo, but no luck. When I ping my office using Altice, the time is fine, but if I ping a Zayo customer or vice versa, it's not. Both providers give me the default route.
 Do you guys have any ideas on what to do?

I configured the port the phone is connecting to as a trunk because it wasn't letting me ping the phone unless I did so. When I look in the phones settings it shows it has an ip given from the dhcp I set up, it shows the tftp server ip that I set on the router and it shows the routers domain name and hostname, and the routers ip, it shows that there is no codec on the phone and in the status when I reboot or factory reset the phone it shows dns no ip, so I tried configuring that but it still doesn't show up. And when I do the upgrade command or create profile command is says error deleted flash:/ then some weird file name that doesn't exist on the router. My supervisor said not to worry about it. Any ideas of what I could be missing? Also before I made it a trunk port the phone would say tftp timed out but now it has the dns thing which confuses me because we're not trying to pull anything from a dns and we have all it needs on the router.

Remember that there are many great people in the IT field, and retaliation only perpetuates the negativity. Keep pushing forward, and eventually, you'll gain their respect and prove your worth.

Regulations require holding onto stuff for a long time, and as I inherited it, and it was working, I left it alone. I started down the Veeam Backup path about 3 years ago as a more rich feature set, as well as a secondary backup system. Just got my Barracuda renewal quote and its a 200% rate increase. Its seriously making me consider that its time to throw in the towel and walk away. Anyone have experience trying to get legacy info out of Barracudas and imported into Veeam? Only idea I have at the minute is to restore the yearlies as a VM, then have Veeam back that up. Just take a point in time from every year. Thanks in advance.

 I’ve been tasked with the seemingly impossible job of trying to figure out how to make the Unitrends backup system meet the needs of our company. 
 In the 3 years we’ve been with Unitrends our situation has gone from bad to worse to where I’m spending majority of my day chasing backups and monitoring ‘round the clock because I can’t take my eyes off the system least I want to spend the next day or two rebooting appliances, stopping/starting tasker, re-syncing assets, etc.
 It’s like pulling teeth trying to get my tickets escalated. They’re putting most of their KB’s behind a pay wall! 
 I’m at my wits end trying to make lemonade out of this lemon. I’m working on picking up bash scripting, but are there any tips, tricks, custom hacks or resources that anyone can recommend for a multi- UB virtual appliance system? 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Background:
 So for some brief background I'm a Jr SysAdmin who has been working for a contractor for a little over half a year now. We manage the entire infrastructure for our client who has a little over a handful of buildings across multiple sites totaling a few hundred rotating users plus about 1500 devices. We use sys asmin very loosely so I was actually originally intended to do help desk.
 Somehow I've somehow found my way to working with firewalls, certs, GPOs, Endpoint-Management, Patching, as well as managing our ePO.
  
The situation:
 Now when I say working on the firewall, I mean teaching our new network engineer how our firewall works as he had never interacted with it (our former left). I don't have the permissions to touch it myself, however I was asked to start managing our certs (some internal, and externals) which would have come with said permissions. I was also set up to manage a site by myself, this being on top of my usual tasks I have been working on.
 Keep in mind I am the only "jr." and make the least money in our team of almost 20 despite me being one of the only 5-ish admins who work at the enterprise level. So with this, I decided to decide to come back and tell them I would be happy to do these things under the condition that they actually pay me more (I make 60, asked for 75).
 This request was then greeted with a sudden lack of interest as well as an email to colleagues behind my back to find out everything I am involved in and/or have been handed. Additionally asking them to stop laying as much work on me.
  
The question:
 I have not received any response in an official capacity yet, but I have a bad feeling. Do you guys think it's time to start applying, or do you think it may go well?
 Thank you guys :)

 Currently going through an M365 migration (E3). I have a number of third party applications that I like (Sentinelone, Splunk, Okta etc.), but there is a number of comparable applications that seem to integrate nicely together. 
 Generally speaking, I'm against putting all my eggs in one basket but I was curious if anyone has pulled the trigger and moved to 100% (or close to) 365/Azure/Sentinel setup and what your experience has been.

 A bit stumped on this one, as I've never seen this before. During this TCP handshake between a client and server, I noticed the client sends a [FIN, ACK] on step 3. Any ideas what could be happening here? Has anyone else encountered this?
 For context, I'm basically trying to send Netflow from a load balancer to a NetFlow collector. The firewall is not blocking this connection, but shows the app as 'incomplete'.
 Here's what I found:
 client: syn server: syn, ack client: fin, ack <---- ? server: ack server: fin, ack client: ack

Right now we're running a smaller Ubiquiti setup (12 switches and 20 Aps, since 2106) without a single failure, but we wanted to step up to a more professional grade brand, investigating Juniper, Ruckus, Forti and Huawei, however the first quotations are expensive, compared to our budget. 
 We need: 
  
24 ports switches: 6 units
 48 ports switches: 15 units
 Eventually 12 aggregation switches (in case there's no stacking option, such as for Ubiquiti)
 78 Wifi 6e APs
  
We have received a Netgear offer, but honestly, at that level I'd rather stay with Ubiquiti. 
 Just wondering if there is any other brand, which deserves to be mentioned, standing in between the top brands and the lower ones (Ubiquiti & Netgear)

 I’ve thoughtfully applied for over 100 jobs in the last few weeks, asking within their own posted salary ranges and never at the high end. I’ve provided cover letters, did research on the companies, the works.
 I want to work, and no matter what effort I put, no matter how I tune my Resume, I have not landed even a single interview. I’ve done everything short of getting on my knees for it, but nobody is hiring. I’m this close to just quitting the industry and joining a trade.

 I want to reorganize my network rack and will need some patch cables. I came across cables from FS.com and I love their snagless plugs and the fact they can be ordered in different lengths and colors but those patch cables are too stiff for my liking. They offer the thin cables but I have mixed feelings about those, especially for PoE patches. Can anyone recommend other brands of Cat6 patch cables that can be ordered in custom lengths and colors with snagless plugs at least as good as the FS ones? I think I would also be fine with Cat5e as I rock a 1 Gbps network.

Got a hit on a suspicious email over the weekend and since I'm on call I decided to take a look. What that email contained was a Powerpoint presentation and a large Excel file with several macros from an outside consulting company that we have hired. Basically, it details a large push to outsource almost all of our business processes by 2026. This includes all of IT. The plan is that we will cut down to less than 1200 employees.
 So, couple of questions. Those have went through an outsourcing before, is it customary for the employees being laid off to be asked to help in the transition? Only scenario I can see that being appealing if I was only a few years from retirement. Is there any other incentive for me to stick around?
 Besides updating my resume, anything else I should do?

I can establish an iBGP peering between the two routers and they exchange routes successfully. However, the firewall itself is unaware of that routing table and therefore does not know how to route to networks beyond the directly connected. While I can also peer iBGP with the firewall I would prefer not to. How can I set up an iBGP peering without also having the firewall participate in BGP?
 I think I would need some other IGP such as OSPF between the routers and the firewall with redistribution from BGP to OSPF in order to make this work. Does that make sense? It seems like a good compromise.
 ​
 TL;DR: How to peer BGP between two routers without having to peer BGP with the firewall between them?

 Sorry, bit of a word salad there. Basically, as I'm sure a lot of you can relate to, we have software that will be two or three versions out of date but aren't aware of it due to the time that would be needed to check each and every piece of software individually. I'm not even sure if something like this exists, honestly.
 Any help/input would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So it’s my first foray into MPO and I got stuck.
 I bought an MPO Type A cable and two Type A MPO-to-12xLC cassettes off FS.
 I know these should be straight 1-1 connected (port 1 = port 1, port 2 = port 2, etc) so using the regular cross polarised LC-LC patch lead at both ends results in the wrong polarity. So I switched around the LC plugs on one end of one of the LC patch cables but the link is still not coming up.
 I tried different ports and even a totally different set of MPO cable and cassettes.
 Using a simple LC-LC patch cable, eliminating the entire MPO/cassette path between the two end devices works fine.
 It’s all singlemode so I cannot “see the light” to figure out what’s going on, and I don’t have any fiber testing tools.
 What am I missing?

 I have two iR-ADV C5740 copiers.
 Recently they were moved to a new building, and now they are having issues with what seems like waking up from a deep sleep. When prints are sent, it's taking a few minutes for it to wake up and print. No settings were changed. It's on a 2 hour sleep timer, which is the longest you can set, and within that time frame it will go back into this deep sleep. It's definitely losing network connection during this sleep, which is why prints are getting stuck in a queue till a point in which it wakes back up. I've found this out when attempting to ping it when reports come in that prints aren't going through.
 Has anyone ran into something like this? I'm leaning more towards an issue with the network or switch than a sleep or energy saving setting, because like I said, nothing was changed.

 I came to the conclusion that there are two types of people that open tickets, people that want their issue resolved, people that want their issue documented and possibly resolved in the future. The second type of effectively uses tickets as a technology to do list. .
 Now, years later, in every job, for every team, every time I go through aging tickets, I identify that trend early on. Sometimes it's impossible to stop people from using the ticket queue as their personal to-do list but awareness is the first step to mitigating this issue.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, i would like some assistance to resolve the problem.
 I have one Jabra Pro 925 Mono headset, did not get it with a dongle when it was ordered.
 The issue is, one of my friends accidently stopped the firmware update on the headset, it was supposed to update to 1.8.2
 Now my headset is constantly glowing with purple color and is stuck updating,(firmvare version 0.0.1) in the aplication Jabra Direct i have the option to recover but there is the catch... So whenever i press the button it goes in starting update mode and goes for hours and never finishes.
 I saw in an old post that there should be a folder in the application:
 C:\Program Files (x86)\Jabra\SDKFirmwareUpdater
 But i do not have this file type (SDKFirmwareUpdater)
 I am using the latest Jabra direct.
 Please help and thank you, for all additional info i will provide

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks,
 I was configuring a new user on Windows 11 and trying to remove onedrive libraries for the Documents folder and also set it to a custom folder. Unfortunately I answered "Yes" to the prompt that gave the following warning
 "Do you want to redirection folder 'Documents' into another system folder 'Profile' located at C:\Users\username"? If you proceed with the redirection you will not be able to separate them or restore default location."
 I've since corrected some registry settings and actually do have the Documents library folder where I want it, however in explorer whenever I view the "C:\Users" folder, instead of showing "username" for the user profile it is showing "Documents" in place of their name. (If you click on the path in the path bar it actually shows the correct username, but whenever it shows folder names anywhere it reverts to showing "Documents").
 I can't seem to find what might be causing this or where it would be set. Is it possible to correct this?
 Everything seems to be working fine, it's just showing "Documents" in place of "username" in the C:\Users folder which is bothering me.
 Thanks.

 Shortcut target is the local path name and works fine when using explorer but fails within the "Save As" dialogue of any program (Office, Notepad, ETC)
 Obviously I can work around this by updating the shortcuts to the hostname/share path but found it weird that it works fine within Explorer. There is also a lot of shortcuts to locations due to the way the business has created its workflow.
 Last update to workstations was 17/04 and we believe its been fine since the update. 
 Im sure this used to work with no issues and there's been no major changes as far as I know. Couldn't be a DNS thing could it? Looking at it I find it weird that it even works in the first place and is still working in explorer considering the target path is D:\ rather than \\hostname

How many scopes were "manageable" on you DHCP servers? We are looking at a design that will require about 650 additional scopes to be added to our DHCP servers. Does this sound rediculous? It sounds a bit much to me (not that we would have so many subnets nationwide... just that we would have that all on a central DHCP server)

 Currently a helpdesk tech looking to learn more about networks to eventually move to a networks admin role.
 Just wanted to ask for a little help. I have been tasked with moving a switch over to a new site.
 I have the switch with me and have been given the new ip address and hostname i need to assign to the box.
 My question is how would I hook up the device so it's discoverable on the network?
 I assume I would have to physically connect one of the ports on the switch to the other stack of switches already there?
 After i do this i assume i just console onto the switch and change the hostname and IP.
 Thanks in advance for the help

 PROBLEM ISP supplied Nokia Gpon ont modem router crashes within 24 or Max 48 hours. Replaced Nokia 3 times and works fine for a month and then starts crashing every 24 hours ISP doesn't offer bridge mode 
 SETUP -Nokia GPON ont modem router with 100Mbps -VLAN trunnked to a Cisco switch and then -Connected to pfsense double NAT (ISP doesn't offer bridge) -Connected to Cisco wlan controller and APs Avg clients connected 200 - pfsense CPU usage at 2% and RAM at 24% temp normal - standard firewall rules except blocked ipv6 broadcasts -rfc1918 disabled on lan and wan -dns resolver and forwarder setup (was having issue with iphones not dnsing, now solved) - daily avg traffic up and down is 500GB - no captive portal - no dual wan - LAN subnet is 192.168.31.0/22 -pfsense wan IP is 192.168.1.2 -ISP modem router lan IP 192.168.1.1 - obviously public IP on isp router 
 This is what I have tried so far 
  
limit sessions to max 20k -session expiry 5 hours (default was 24 hours and sessions were reaching 20K) 
 traffic shaper using limiters limits speed to 20Mbps up and down
 DHCP expiry 6 hours (majority of clients change every 24 hours)
 nftop monitoring (found torrents and blocked)
  
Temp solution is to restart the Nokia and everything works fine. 
 What am I missing here? There is no way to bridge the modem and no other isp serves this area. 
 What is crashing the NoKia gpon ont modem router? 
 How can I use pfsense to detect the issue and solve it?

 I've got a customer who is moving from a flat network into an ACI/SDA, and want to move their various BMS devices in with them. First thing to move in will be the door access.
 Does anyone have much experience of this? As the door access are all on a flat subnet, they work nicely, then I move them into the SDA, do I need to run an L2 transit specifically for their own VN, or is IP Directed Broadcast where I need to be looking?
 The longer term plan is to move the BMS server into the ACI from the current LAN - as a further question, how can that be integrated? I'm siding with L2 transit..

Even though it involves servers and other enterprise equipment, I don't really know anything about setting them up. I'm slowly getting further and further into debt because it doesn't pay well, and I don't feel that I'll ever progress past the point I'm at now because this is literally all the company does. I'm at a total dead end. It's really impacting me mentally and I'm legitimately getting worried that one day I'll just decide to give up on everything.
 I've tried applying to a couple of IT support and SysAdmin jobs locally but it's clear that I don't have the skills they're looking for. I have no skills in anything else either, no degree or anything like that. All I can really do is self-teach if I ever get the motivation to do so. But it seems that everything I look at seems to be giving me different answers. I just want to know, from some people in the industry, what sorts of things should I be looking at when gaining the skills for a SysAdmin job? What software, languages etc should I be learning to use? Any way to learn them for free or as cheap as possible? I can't afford any kind of certification like CCNA or CompTIA, so is it worth making a portfolio? How would I do that?
 Basically just any advice would be much appreciated. I'm so lost and overwhelmed right now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I am trying to setup a Windows 10 Multi App Kiosk with some camera software (Hikvision iVMS-4200 Desktop client) which requires admin privileges. Please note this a staff facing kiosk not a public facing kiosk.
 Following this tutorial (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/lock-down-windows-10-to-specific-apps). I have managed to set up my Kiosk on a Standard Windows Account. With a seperate Admin Account to manage the PC. In the kiosk when I click on the application it triggers the "User Account Control" (UAC) pop up asking for the admin password. 
 I have tried the following to bypass this:
  
Changing UAC settings in Control Panel to have not notify. This works for the standard account when not in Kiosk Mode. But when I apply the kiosk provisioning package it seems to turn UAC back on. 
 Changing the compatibility settings to "Run as Admin" for the exe.
 Following (https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/app_compatibility_view.html) from Reddit Question (https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/khda06/windows_10_kiosk_mode_running_an_app_with/) I have tried to change this to "Run as Invoker". 
 Changing the permissions of the folder in which the exe lives in to give standard accounts full permission over that folder.
  
All of these "fixes" work when the kiosk account normally but stops working when I apply the kiosk mode.
 This would make sense as the single app kiosk docs say that UAC need to be enabled for it to work (https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/configuration/kiosk-single-app). I presume this is the same for multi app kiosk mode.
 Essentially is there any way that I can get an application requiring admin privileges running inside a kiosk without
 Or is there another work around. Something like are we able to create an admin account that could use its password to pass the UAC but does not have a "Desktop Login". Then I can just share that password. 
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently landed a gig consulting for about $150/hr. Contract is 6 months, but this is government work so it could probably last a year or more.
 Post COVID, with the advent of much more remote work, I've begun exploring taking several lower level positions that are 100% remote to help me reach my financial retirement goals sooner. 
 I feel like my salary is atypical. A 300k job for an engineer is quite rare in my opinion, but on /r/sales it seemed to be suggested that this was quite normal, with people going up to 500-700k and beyond for exceptional performers. 
 Now, working multiple lower end jobs, I can see myself comfortably achieving 300~500k (2-3 jobs). I basically just see myself as my own consulting business, taking on multiple clients who renting my time. Whether they use it or not is up to them. 
 I'm just hoping to get an engineer's take on how much of what is said on /r/sales about those salaries is chest thumping versus reality. Are 250k-300k sales jobs typical? I know SEs that get 220~240 for OTE. 
 I feel like you could be a great salesman, get a shitty account list at the wrong time (for example competing vendor wins project) and then be left with a dry patch and fail to make your number. Idk, it seems like it's not always under your control.

 If you have a router in front of your firewall and a small IP block from your ISP do you generally set up a transit VLAN between the router/firewall using your public space and NAT on the firewall or run RFC1918 space between them and NAT at the router? 
 I feel like it would be more beneficial to dPAT at the edge and static NAT whatever on the inside needs to be accessible but I see a lot of people deploying public IP space on the transit VLAN between router/fw and NAT on the FW.

 I guess my question here is if you are using MPLS does each branch location get its own public ip address for the internet? or is everything routed to the primary office then sent out to the internet? 
 If anyone has any material on this, I would really appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys. I’m knees deep in a cloning project for 17 laptops using Clonezilla and I’m wondering why you would use Sysprep in audit mode. 
 In my case- all my laptops that are getting imaged are all the same model. 
 After I’m done building my reference image, I plan on Sysprepping with /oobe/generalize and shutdown options. (I’ll also make sure I delete the user I’ve been using to install everything and create a new “offline account” to run sysprep so as not to trigger the Windows Store from interfering with Sysprep. Before reboot I’ll clone. 
 Let’s say after I sysprep, I realize I forgot a piece of software, or want to tweak a setting. 
 Wouldn’t it be just as easy to boot into the oobe, make any changes and sysprep again rather than going into Audit mode? You can sysprep the same image 1001 times now. Perhaps Audit mode was a better option when sysprep was limited to 3 times?
 Looking for an easy explanation of why/when to use Audit mode in sysprep. 
 Thanks guys!
 Edit to ask another question:
 Can you unbox a new laptop with an OEM image of Windows 10 , customize then sysprep it? Or do you need to install a Volume Lic version of your own on the new laptop? I have a MAK license.

Root access disabled via SSH
 Limited user provisioned

 UFW firewall only exposing the necessary ports
  
How well would you assess the security based on the above?
 Is there anything else I should do to have give myself peace of mind the boxes will stay secure?Would you recommend installing unattended updates?
 Are there any tools that can assess the security of a box? And make adjustments? 
 I'm a bit new to this, I'm interested to know what the industry standards are.

 We tried a FS.com 100gb qsfp breakout DAC on the Aruba to 25gb sfp on the fortigate but it's not recognizing anything on the Aruba side. Fortigate can see the transceiver but says unsupported. Aruba acts like nothing exists and unsupported transceivers have been enabled. 
 Aruba says it needs to be an Aruba transceiver. Fortigate says it needs fortigate. Go figure... 
 DAC would be ideal since it's a very short run but if anyone knows of optics that would work, that's fine too. Trying not to break the bank with 20k transceivers here. Don't want to keep buying things that "might" work.

Senior Management wishes to give out our Guest network SSID and password, without using our Network Access Control solution, to our customers. I was told that "those portals are clunky and a terrible customer experience". I argued that the NAC would require them to resign every 8 hours (i.e. daily) and prevent our lobby from becoming a Cafe. I argued that the portal will provide a disclosure laying out terms of usage, etc. I also argued that there's virtually no difference, in terms of effort, between typing a password vs. typing an email address.
 Any other arguments I can make to non-technical people?

Never thought I would have one of these post but here we are admins. I have had 2 interviews today and pretty sure I bombed both. One I already know for sure. I am only interviewing now because my current remote job denied me working in another state and just said no which I don’t understand because we have out of state workers. 
 I’m tired of failing technical questions to dumb easy shit I haven’t used in 8 years and not getting a job. I’m tired of being laid off job after job due to shitty management, being outsourced, Covid 19, or being forced to look because my current position won’t help. I used to love doing this job, I have for over 10 years now, but I think God, the moon, or something is telling me to change it up. I’m frustrated, tired, and just pissed that I am 36 and having to potentially change careers because if I don’t my mental health is gonna send my physical into a spiral and I leave my wife a widow at 40. 
 If you read all of this thank you for joining my TedRant. I’m gonna go for a walk and try not to break down anymore today.

The firewalls provide NGFW and NGIPS features between every VLAN and VPN connections to remote sites
 The Nexus switches will be 10Gbps connection for quite a few access switches. Only server and 1 department are depicted in this picture
 Full redundancy
  
My concerns with the design
  
Are the firewalls appropriately placed to provide IPS and FW functions?
 Are the Nexus switches overkill for this topology?
  
Any tips/assistance/comments will be appreciated.

I got called for the interview, and when I showed up, they immediately said that they needed me on their IT department based on my Resume (10+ years of self employed computer repair experience). I've only done low level repair work, and some minor networking, and I was completely honest about that. Well they hired me as a salaried junior network engineer, and just told me to learn as much as I could, and that they understood that this would be a learning process for me. I've just finished my 90 days and I have had everything dumped on me by my supervisor from configuring firewall rules to setting up domain controllers with nothing more than a "you'll figure it out". Thankfully I've been able to handle all the craziness thrown at me, mainly because I'm excellent at troubleshooting, but I've been terrified this whole time, and I'm extremely fearful that I'll mess something important up. I know I'm not qualified to do sysadmin duties just yet, but they're forcing me to do it. I've been made global admin within my first month of being here. Is this just imposter syndrome, and I should keep going and pray for the best, or should I let them know that I'm feeling overwhelmed before I face an issue that could hurt my reputation. Sorry it's so long just freaking out lol

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I volunteer for a youth organization that has a camp in BFE. Strangely, BFE has FTTH... Anyway, I co-admin the network spread between the various buildings on the property through fiber. Currently, services just include wireless internet, voip phones, and a couple of hardwired printers. Long range, I'd love to add some security cameras, but I need to get buy-in from the professional leadership that own/lead the camp. The network is purposefully flat with no vlans for quick repair and troubleshooting if one of the skilled network admins aren't on site.
 Historically, we've used older Cisco PoE switches (3750, or thereabouts) purchased off of ebay or the random cast-off from corporate donors along with a Cisco cleanair n-wireless controller and APs for wireless. Generally speaking, we only need 8 PoE ports plus a SFP uplink in 99% of our buildings since other than phones and wireless APs, everything is done over wireless.
 The most common failure mode of our switches are power supply failure, either from old age or occasionally poor power conditions. But, obtaining switches to replace a couple every year has been difficult and adding up. The Cisco 3750s are between $60-100 generally on ebay, but I am wondering if there's a better value PoE switch out there that isn't so long in the tooth? Yes, I know $100 or less per switch is really a pretty good deal, but when the budget is $0 and you have a very small pool of people willing to donate money or equipment, it gets demoralizing

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys,
 i am trying to troubleshoot why some OT devices in a big vlan ~281 hosts are not responding to ping after some time.
 We have a Client where every 30min a ftp connection to a ot devices is established. Sometimes we get the notification that the ftp transfer failed. The client is in a seperate vlan.
 I tried to sniff packets from the ftp client and the only thing I see is TCP Retransmissions of the first SYN packet everytime.
 Then I looked at the port where the ftp server is connected and I see that the TCP Syn Packets are arriving there. Also I can ping other devices on the same vlan during this time but I don't get SYN ACK packets back from the server.
 I see that the ftp server sends "Who has 192.168.100.254? Tell 192.168.100.250" then the Gateway responds with "192.168.100.254 is at 00:09:0f:09:1c:be". It is like this over and over until you restart the ot ftp device. The delay between the arp who has tell is 6,9,5,11,27 seconds.
 What could that be? A ping also from the same vlan to the ot ftp device during this time is also not possible.
 EDITED: IT's 281 not 1022 active Hosts the Subnet's size would be 1022 Hosts but only 281 Hosts are currently connected.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've been running Fortinet & Ubiquiti switches and AP's for a while, but now we might have a good line on Datto equipment.
 On the one hand, I REALLY like the Fortinet devices because of SPOG management and the NAC-lite features when integrated with FortiGate has been useful in our more secure environments.
 Ubiquiti is just plain affordable for our SMB clients and while it's nowhere near as feature rich, the base features are pretty easy enough to use that my techs don't need to know ALL the networking stuff to do some basic troubleshooting if they have to. Plus, the flex mini switch is honestly a godsend - a $30 managed/ish POE-powered switch is a fantastic alternative to some random box that gets added when someone needs just one more port.
 Our company uses Kaseya which means we could manage the network from our RMM platform - a potentially huge benefit. But I only know Datto from its software, not as a networking company, so I'm curious if their hardware actually holds up

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Was hoping to reach out to see if any of you have any thoughts on this. I have a M365 tenant of about 70 users, and they are all online, using OneDrive/Teams/Sharepoint. Have been on this system for almost 4 years. Been very happy with it.
 But over the last 6 months or so, we are seeing a dramatic climb in space usage, and we have had to provision more sharepoint space accordingly. But...we dont know whats causing it.
 Most of the teams sites are private, so they dont show up as anything more than 0 when looking at space. And powershell reports to CSV dont show much change of hard drive space at all. 
 For example, over the weekend, 10GB used up. 
 Frankly, Im unimpressed with how M365 reports some of this, so I figure there must be a better way, but maybe not. Thought I would flip it to you all to see if anyone has run into this before, and some pointers?

 I don't mind spending a bit more if necessary, but these were a great value and the UI/functionality was perfect, especially at this price point.
 Does such a switch exist?

We have any application that started failing authentication and it didn't work again until we uninstalled the patches from the DCs. This app uses a keytab file using RC4 and we have updated the service account msds-supportedencryption type to RC4 (which is what allowed it to work after the November patches). Interestingly enough, another application using the same keytab / service account (I know bad practice) continued to work fine but it was using our updated 2019 domain controllers (the broken app can't use these ones at the moment). I didn't see anything specific in the patch info that would be a smoking gun for this issue.

 Right now, my boss and I are trying to figure out if Defender is a good fit for our on-prem servers. The only critical thing that they're doing is DNS and DHCP management. None of them are open to the world. We have some internal teams using apps on different servers, but they're not critical to the operation.
 Has anyone used Defender in their server environment? Why or why not? I'll be transparent in saying that I'm not super familiar with either Defender nor ESET and am currently doing my research. I just like coming here to see what other people's experiences are.

 Hey everyone,
 With the unknowns in the economy, which lower cost of living city (prefer small to mid-sized) would you suggest relocating to? Currently in a major city - new location should have plenty of available IT jobs (excluding help-desk). Please include pros and cons for suggestions. This is for the US. Considering the midwest and perhaps south, southeast. However, open to options if the area is right - relatively safe and housing options are not the size of a shoebox.

 Some sites are small, with just a few users, and a couple sites are larger with access points, cameras, etc.
 If we replace our aging 2960x's at remote sites, Meraki has two models we are looking at:
 MS225 (no ospf, but capable of 16 static routes)
 MS250 (ospf, also does static routes)
 Do we "need" to pay extra for the MS250 in this case? Does OSPF matter at the edge if we are only using one strand of fiber?

 We host a domain-controller (2016) where they have been using folder redirection for some time.
 All of the devices are located on 4 other sites, connected with site-to-site VPN to the DC on the gateway-level.
 I want to revert this and move everything back to the local userprofiles.
 I ticked the box "Redirect the folder back to the local userprofile location when policy is removed", made sure that was spinning for some days before setting "Not configured" on all the folder redirections one at a time every other day. (Just to prevent slowdowns)
 Nothing happened.
 Tried enabling one of them and set it to "Redirect to the local userprofile location" and restarted.
 Got an error in Event Viewer (502) stating that the path couldn't be reached, it could be offline, even though I can ping and browse to \server\folder redirection.
 Any ideas on what might be wrong or other ways to move everything back to the respective user's local profile?

 The user has a Microsoft Bussiness Basic licence.
 We bought a Office 2019 proffesional plus license online.
 ( i like to add that we did this over a 100 times before and that went well all the time.)
 ok so now the issue:
 I start 1 of the office applications ( i does not matter wich one. in this case i use word)
  
The screen pop up comes that asks for a product key, so i put in the product key
 
i press activate office
 
a new screen comes that asks me to sign in.
 
when i enter the account its shows this account does not exist
 
 The same occurs when i log in to word first and then try to activate, same bad result.
 That why its so weird, ik can login to the office 2019 app and it reconizes the account, when i go activate office it shows account unknown. 
 I hope someone can help me....

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll try to make this as brief as possible. We're in the process of transitioning off our AS400 system. IBM said they would provide us with technical (hardware & software) support until August (to get support even up until this date has taken direct appeals to IBM for extensions on our support contract). I'm not sure what happened, but that story and timeline has changed to April 30th.
 (I believe it was simply human error on our end, a misread or something, but that is really irrelevant here and now.) 
 So, now we are scrambling to find a viable option for hardware support for this interim period (4-6 months) until we've fully switched to a new system. And to be clear, the team that setting up our new system is not equipped to handle support requests that might come in for the existing AS400 system.
 ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND: we are a rather small - I'd like to say almost mom/pop type - manufacturer in Northern New Jersey (Carlstadt, Bergen County). They've used the AS400 for nearly 30/35 years and what little tech expertise we had, has long ago left. I'm a new (~2 years) web designer and developer (and unfortunately, the all around IT person) here and the only person with adequate and competent technical skills. So i've been asked for help with this. 
 I'd be happy to answer questions if anyone has any relevant, but I am hoping experts out there might have some solid advice for me on where to start looking. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE TO ANYONE THAT TAKES THE TIME TO READ AND APPLY, I APPRECIATE IT.

 I started a business and needing a mailserver. I have different domains on my Cloudflare account which i want to use.
 Im going to use google workspace mainly with domain A.
 I also have domain B which is used by my services (git etc. to send emails)
 I also have domain C and D which are for my customers. 
 So im looking at a mail hosting with different tiers for example a lite tier with almost none features except sending emails and a tier which can be used as a daily mail.
 Does anyone know such a hoster?
 Looked at Mailbox.org and Zoho mail but idk if there is something better.
 Thank you all! Would be nice if someone could help me!

Are there any examples? For example, does one get extra learning points for CCNP if they have other professional certifications?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our Outlook signatures contain images promoting our upcoming events. We rotate these images every 2-3 weeks.
 Currently, our marketing teams sends an email around, asking everyone to update their signature, but this (obviously) is very annoying and I quite often see users with outdated signatures.
 What I tried:
  
Disclaimer in Microsoft 365 Exchange - not feasible because it doesn't support images and would require IT to build HTML from whatever the marketing team comes up with.
 Set-OutlookSignatures - Doesn't seem reliable. I had it fail for some mailboxes and couldn't figure out the reason for the errors "mailbox does not exist". It's decently documented, but it's OSS after all with no real support.
 Third party solutions - They cost like 5 bucks per user per month and I cannot get that budget approved. Also, an Outlook plugin alone doesn't really do it, because it cannot be used on Mac, phones or Outlook Web.
  
Ideally, I need a way to attach content from a Word document to all emails, so that the marketing team can change and update the signature on their own. We have around 35 employees.
 Any reliable, low-maintenance, not-too-expensive solutions you would recommend for an organziation with 35 employees?

 Our server rooms are wrongly set out, but thats the way it's going to remain... We have pretty small "aisles" Infront of each rack, so if we were to get a lift it would need to be quite small wheel based.
 Do any of you have something in mind? Either electric or manual crank is fine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Networkers,
 I have been trying to configure 802.1X with EAP-TLS in a Windows domain for a while now. Using freshly installed Win Server 2022 for DC and PKI, and ClearPass in a Lab environment (was set up after the configuration didn't work in the production environment). 
 Certificates for computer and user authentication are distributed cleanly via autoenrollment and authentication on the network works fine - but only after the user GPOs have already been processed and the user is already on the desktop. With this, the GPOs for folder redirects and drive mappings don't work because the client can't reach the file server without user authentication. Wireshark shows me that the client first tries to get to the file server long before 802.1X user authentication takes place.
 If I disconnect the network connection while logged in and re-establish it, authentication works immediately. 
 Microsoft support has not been able to help us so far and Aruba is not aware of the problem either.
 Do you have any tips?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Firstly I wanna say I'm a bit of a "noob" right now when it comes to this stuff, but I'm trying to understand. Just got a job as an It Support which won't include just regular helpdesk tasks but also more and more administrator stuff etc... So there's a few things I wanna ask.
 We're a company of around 60 employees and are expanding pretty fast, so we have to put some more effort on the safety side of things. Right now we have a shared network domain (is this the right term?) Where we have access to the same files etc... Now we'd also like to have a local? domain, where all users would fall under one place and at login you'd have that thing where you can log in to user or into administrator. We also have 4-5 MacOS users. How would that go, to have windows and mac on the same AD? What to use? Co-worker was mentioning LDAP and FREEIPA? I also saw something about NoMAD? Is there a way to have two factor authentication to log-in to windows?
 + when we'd have all of that set up, what would be the best tool to manage everything? Right now we're using Synology I think, for granting access to users for certain files... I also saw something about JAMF?
 ​
 Sorry if all of this is written poorly, as I said, currently my understanding of all off this is not the best, but I'd like to come up with a suggestion or two of "my own", if any of you would have a suggestion or two or point me in the right direction, that would be great.

 i had previously used the same driver on a different vps provider (vultr) & it worked flawlessly there meaning after installing the ethernet driver, it instantly connected to the internet.
 edit: i'm thinking becoz the windows not asking my permission to install the driver, it for some reason isn't installing the driver correctly even though it appears on device manager menu. i don't know what exactly is the issue, so i'm just spitballing here.
 Ethernet driver: Red Hat VirtlO Ethernet Adapter

 I've looked at a few FOSS options for various tasks, but the vast majority are self-hosted and for someone who has next to no Linux, Docker, etc experience and no time to maintain them, a lot of FOSS isn't viable.
 One tool in particular that I'm looking for is a way to manage logs from various sources (firewall, servers, etc.).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have currently a Server 2016 based RDS farm using roaming profiles. Everything is working just fine there. Whenever we install office in the OfficeDeploymentTool config file I have the information to use roaming licensing tokens
 Property Name="SCLCacheOverride" Value="1" /> <Property Name="SharedComputerLicensing" Value="1" /> <Property Name="SCLCacheOverrideDirectory" Value="%appdata%\Microsoft\Office" /> 
 Everything works just the way it should on those servers.
 So now im looking to move up to Server2019 based RDS host. I install office the same way, but on the 2019 host it doesn't seem to ever download the token. When you open office products you are greeted with a "Sign in to setup office" you click ok then get "Activate Office" At that point it ask for your email. Plug that information in but then it never ask for a password. Then all your office products get the pink banner up top stating "problem with shared computer licensing" I looked at the registry entries and those are correct. If I log into the 2016 RDS, activate office then copy one of the tokens. I can log out of the 2016 then come back to the 2019 and the token roams over and office is activated and just fine. Its just the initial downloading of the tokens that 2019 seems to be having a problem with. Is there something I'm missing about getting it working on 2019?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I'm trying to find an SMB grade router to replace the one we currently have (TP-Link Archer MR400 w/ 4G LTE), in order to support more devices.
 Some context:
 Currently, we already have around ~60 devices and we're starting to see problems with some devices being unreachable once we add new ones to the network.
 These are IoT devices (Shelly1 and Shelly Pro1), so the network traffic, while busy (mainly MQTT keep alive messages and similar payloads), shouldn't be the actual problem, rather it seems we're just hitting the maximum number of supported devices connected simultaneously.
 We have two locations (~400m distance) that share the same network. The IoT devices are located in two cabinets in each site.
 On the main site, we have a mix of Shelly1's connected via Wi-Fi and Shelly Pro1's connected by cable (RJ45) to the router.
 On the second site we only have Shelly1's, which connect to an access point that is then connected via cable to the router in the main site.
 Technically, most devices connect to the router by cable, rather than Wi-Fi.
 Given we'll be adding more devices (cable only, no Wi-Fi) in the near future, we want something that could handle from 100 to ~200 devices.
 I found related questions here, here and here, but didn't quite help.
 Could you share your experiences in similar scenarios and what you have used?
 I appreciate your time.
 Cheers,
 Q

I'm mainly storing immutable information, photos. I also have a different pool on the same NAS that has snapshots but I would like to move the snapshots out of the same hardware to make it more robust. I really would like to avoid cloud storage and I'm looking for a cost effective solution. 
 From the information that I was able to gather, looks like M Disk Bluray could be the solution. Anyone have any experience with it or have any other suggestions?

 I was thinking of doing a manual self audit and skipping any potential issues that the migration tool might bring up or if there is a learning curve involved in terms of setting the thing up.
 If i did set it up, would i be able to click and choose what object groups i'd like to migrate? Same for rules and NAT rules?

 I want to ask you if the firewall cluster ( that is draw in the diagram, bellow it's a similar diagram ) it's "in the right place".
 https://content.spiceworksstatic.com/service.community/p/post_images/0000339409/5c19c899/attached_image/filejpeg.jpg
 I also have some pure site to site vpn ipsec with others that it's "done" the ISR routers.
 On the ISR routers i also want to do the NAT + IPSEC site to site vpn + Anyconnect
 Can you also please come with other ideas/opinon ? It's a good design ? bad design ?
 the actual network right now it's in a bad shape and that's why i need to redesign the things.
 It's a not a big network behind ( 200 - 300 users something like that and more of them are practically remote and connecting via the anyconnect ).
 Also there are some servers behind ( 2 vcenters with some virtual servers + storage ).
 What do you thing ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have a layer 3 switch with a handful of vlans and SVI configured. I need to configure inter-VLAN multicast routing.
 The source and receivers are in separate subnets which terminate on the layer 3 switch.
 Multicast traffic does not need to route beyond the layer 3 switch.
 Can I just: 
 enable ‘ip multicast routing’ globally and ‘ip pim dense-mode’ on the SVI’s?
 Or is it better to:
 enable a loopback on the L3 switch, configure ‘ip PIM rp-address <loopback IP>’
 Configure ‘ip pim sparse-mode’ on the SVI
 Configure IGMP snooping on the downstream L2 switch ports? Is this required or just preferable?
 Or are both approaches wrong? 
 I have never needed to configure mcast until now and my only experience is reading the CCNP ENCOR OCG / watching Kevin Wallace videos / googling around. 
 Would either of the above approaches work or have I missed something crucial due to inexperience?
 Thanks as always!

 I'm trying to wrap my head around why anyone would choose this type of firewall for a small office that has 5-7 employees.
 When asked what is the purpose of the server is the owner doesn't even know. They only use the Nas for their data but that is a discussion for another time. My concern right now is why fortigate? Is it that much better than a Sonicwall or a pfsense?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just completed an overhaul of a nightmare network cabinet at a lab. I can't post before/after images here unfortunately. 
 I've used a 15U wall mount cabinet that houses some fans at the top, an Adva box, a Cisco box, a Draytek router, two 24 port patch panels, two 24 port Netgear switches and a PDU.
 I left a 1U gap between all the active equipment units. I mounted a 1U horizontal cable management bar between each patch panel and network switch. There's no spare space left in the cabinet.
 I used 50cm patch cables as I read this is the minimum certified length. However, the patch cables have ended up looking messy as there's no way to make them look neat unless I used shorter cables which I'm kinda reluctant to.
 So the question is, did I goof and should have gotten a bigger cabinet and left 2U for the patch cables or should I just go with shorter patch cables?
 Patchsave sell 10cm and 20cm ones.

 What is the most modern thing with the least friction people are doing these days?
 SCCM is overkill I think and I don't have a person to manage that platform anyway.
 Does anyone have experience with azure arc? even if we have no workloads on azure that looks like an interesting option.
 is there anything else I haven't thought of?
 The environment is relatively static. GPOs and WSUS take care of patching right now. Most of the applications running on these machines are unique snowflakes that don't work well with automation. So things are...ok.
 However whenever we want to make a small change to servers or deploy some kind of agent or new tool, its a pain in the ass without central management.

 I need to make a plan to get an entry level role in networking and need some assistance.
 ---------------------------------
 Wants:
  
I need a degree: I know WGU is nice and I can obtain CCNA shortly after. Anyone have any better recommendations? Cost is not an issue but time is, I want to finish it as fast as I can.
 I need certs: I only hold CISSP and Sec + (expired). I plan on CCNA and possibly some AWS certs (architect and dev ops associates).
 I need a job: I need to land an entry level networking role that can get me the experience needed to progress in the field.
 Future: I eventually want to progress to network engineer or network security engineer. Am not entirely sure what credentials (other than experience) I would need for this career.
  
---------------------------------
 Experience/me: 
  
I am 40 years old and retired military, am I too old? I know age discrimination is a real thing in this field.
 8 years military related IT roles in IT security. All RMF and compliance focused.
 4 of those years I did light sys admin work for classified networks. Helped design and build a few network segments and have hands on with VOIP, VTC, encryption (TACLAN) and Active Directory.
 Fluent in Linux (was studying for OSCP) and win environments. 
 Have studied for AWS certs and could prob pass the dev ops assoc. in two months time. CCNA would prob take me month or so as well.
  
---------------------------------
 So, what are your thoughts, recommendations or concerns? 
 If you have any advice or experience making a transition like this I would love to hear from you as well.
 Any ideas on how I can make this plan better or more efficient please let me know as well.
 Actually, any advice would be helpful.

I went to do this recently though and the old url isnt accessible "The specified key does not exist". How can I change the url of the object to what it used to be so its accessible from the old url??? Any help would be awesome as I am stumped on how to do it

 Does it matter what OS domain joined computers are on? From everything I've read only the lowest DC server version matters. So if you have a 2016 DC and a 2022 DC you can raise to 2016 domain functional level.

Since a few months this somehow broke. Users get the message that there are connection problems when trying to change their password. It's clearly not a connection problem but something in the configuration that broke. Only way to change the password is on the local AD. Admins can't change it in AzureAD either. I've already tested the sync and password settings with the AD sync tool and everything showed as working. Any pointers where to look to fix this problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was reading somewhere about this but I am not sure if it's true for most devices. Does this true for SSD disks? Can I have an SSD disk and periodically (once a week) connect it to a power supply or a computer to "refresh" the charges? Is there a way to determine if my USB flash drive refreshes the data automatically when I plug it in?
 Or it's best to delete the data with the Secure Erase unit command or similar method and then rewrite it?
 If I make a second copy does this guarantee to make a copy of the data or there are algorithms for deduplication that prevent it? My experience is that writing the data twice is about twice as slow, therefore I assume no deduplication happens. But I am not sure about all devices.
 My main concern with not erasing the drive and writing the data again is that the file allocation table may get damaged because some of the bits are not overwritten (refreshed). And I may get a random gibberish when I try to read my files.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A little background before I ask the question. I have been in IT for over 10 years. At my current job for 7 of that 10. Started as a deskside tech then network admin and as of 4 years ago a sysadmin. My manager at the time saw me doing more than just the network so he wanted to give me a different title as I worked with all the systems. The only way for me to make more than the 5% a year raise is to become a SR sysadmin. We had three SR sysadmins and then me up until 2 years ago when 2 randomly left. I stepped up and became lead on all major projects because I was skilled in many areas. The remaining SR was just apps and that is it. I worked with the Manger at the time to change my title and he wanted to base the requirements off of the past SRs job descriptions. I was ok with this because my skills and projects matched it. Thought I had it in the bag.... then the manager left.... nothing had been finalized or in writing. A new manager has been brought in and believes a SR is based off how many Certificates you have. Nothing is changing his mind. I asked if they would pay for them and he said yes. So I want to brush up on them and just start scheduling. I have had plenty early on to help my growth but they expired. He probably does not believe my talent and I want to hold him to it. Kind of a malicious compliance. Maybe he is trying to save money while under paying me for as long as he can...
 Question: would it become an issue if I started taking one every two weeks? Would is cause me any issues? Like would they question whether I was cheating or not? 
 I attend yearly training for any upcoming projects. As an example. When we moved to palo alto firewalls I took a week long boot camp and got certified 4 years ago.(expired in oct) We planned to move to azure. So I took another bootcamp to get ready. About to attend a bootcamp for my CISSP.

 Current I guess you would call me a junior sysadmin. I support about 6 very small schools, all using windows systems. I'm pretty confident in day to day tasks with windows server, win 10, and iPad support at this point.
 In your opinion, if I were to start looking at finding a new job, would you recommend upskilling further with windows server to the point I could potentially be a sysadmin on my own for a smaller business. Start learning everything I can about Linux systems (I have literally 0 experience with Linux) or look into cloud systems such as Azure or something else? Where do you see the most opportunities being opened up?

 I have a ton of MFA codes I use for work and I need a good iOS app that I can have a backup and is easy to switch and restore on another device.
 I already have Okta for my company stuff and Microsoft’s app for that stuff but a lot of our clients SIEMs need MFA so I have like 20+ codes I used daily.
 I initially set up Duo on my Android since IT recommended that for storing backups in Google Drive, but then I got my work equipment and they sent me an iPhone so I would like to move everything over.
 Some people recommended Airbus. What’s your recommendation? I don’t want to have to annoy engineering to reset my SIEM creds if I choose a shitty app that causes problems.

 So I’m hoping someone here maybe has a copy of it somewhere. Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a project that i am setting up some new servers with security baselines using DSC instead of GPOs. That's all good and the systems are getting configured ok.
 1) I can only assume that because these servers are domain joined the users who login carry policies from the OUs they live and that will be applied when the user logs in. Is this correct? Are there any implications if DSC configures the computer and GPO configures the user portion only?
 2) How can i configure restricted groups? Any idea? Do i need to resort to configuring the local groups explicitly instead ?? I am thinking to create a GPO with the restricted groups and try and export it as a baseline then merge is in my DSC config... Just a thought. Has anyone tried something like that?
 3) In case i need to build a standalone server with DSC security baselines only, how am i going to configure any user settings ? Is this possible ?
 3) Is there a loopback analogue in the DSC like the GPO?
 These are pretty much late night thoughts, i am going to crack on in the lab one of these days testing all these however i would like to hear from more experienced sysadmins just in case i save myself a lot of testing time!
 Thanks!

 There is likely going to be a potential opening for a new sysadmin role at my company, my manager is pushing really hard for me to get the promotion due to my previous training in Active Directory and network administration.
 However, we have a hybrid environment and while I've been really good at picking up on how to administer the various technologies we use (Intune, SharePoint, etc)
 Does anyone have any recommendations on certifications or recommended training?
 For background our full environment is hybrid AD/AAD with AD Connect Sync, SharePoint, Exchange, and Intune for MDM/MAM.
 I've been looking at MS-100-101 as our C-Suite is starting to take cyber-security pretty seriously and also AZ-800-801 as well.
 I'm also working on developing my Powershell skills.
 I'm passable at them but want to get much better at using it to make writing automation scripts and tasks easier.
 Any suggestions would be very helpful, sorry if this is posted a lot but I couldn't find anything in the FAQ so I'd figured I'd make a post.

 Structure: VirtualBox with Ubuntu 1 → USB2Ethernet → Ethernet2SFP → SFP2Ethernet → Ethernet2USB → VirtualBox with Ubuntu 2.
 (Add1: In reality I have a breakout-board with two additional SFP-Modules in between the SFP2Ethernet-convertes to inspect the transmitted signal with an oscilloscope - but since it does nothing to the data it seems irrelevant for the question)(Add2: The SFP2Ethernet-convertes are from 10Gtek.

I'm a CS major and have interned as a Software Engineer and Backend developer (modeling, testing and implementing DB's) but to be honest i don't want to develop Applications at all as a fulltime job because that doesn't really seem fulfilling to me. I rather have a direct impact on other Developers and teams / the people around me! 
 I do enjoy programming though, especailly Python to automate things with. I've been reading a little about sysadmin stuff and i do know the basics of bash scripting, know how to get around, use VIM, i've done a Kali linux class that was pretty extensive and have my CCNA from my Networking class in school and most important i quite enjoyed learning all that. 
 What i'm wondering is, are there jobs that kind of mix these things together? Where i can automate things, develop solutions for Developers around me while still leveraging my computer science / coding skills?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everybody,
 I currently work for a local government outside the US with a relatively small IT department. I am currently the teammember with the longest employment with just 17 months working here. It was (and still is) a wild ride.
 We currently face the challenge, that our core-switches and a lot of our network switches are extremly old. We also have two networks (one for the city government and one for the schools of the city) with different brands of switches that run together on a single core-switch each. The core-switches are not redundant. It's a bit of a mess.
 One network is currently running on Nortel and Extreme switches, the other one is mainly Aruba and HP. We also use Aruba for our WIFI.
 Out goal is to replace both core-switches, and make both networks run redundantly over both core-switches (still seperated via VLANs). Also, currently nearly all our routing is done by the core-switches instead of the firewall. We want to change that as well.
 We also have to replace a huge amount of our switches over the next year or two. Here we want to choose one brand for both networks, that we stick with in the future.
 Now I am not very deep into the networking side of things (yet). I am normaly more of a sysadmin. That's why I wanted to ask you guys for some recommendations on how to approach this.
 What brands of switch-manifacturers would you recommend? What technologies should I look out for? What should I avoid?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My understanding of SASE is that clients install an agent that tunnels up to the SASE provider’s cloud, and routes all outbound traffic via this tunnel, where it goes through the provider’s Firewall in said cloud instance, and then egresses from there. To access on-prem company resources, a light weight connector VM is dropped somewhere in the datacenter that tunnels up to the same SASE provider cloud, and acts as a proxy of sorts.
 In theory this eliminates remote access vpn full tunneling into your network.. remote users no longer get a routable IP that can be reached from on-prem, meaning they also can’t reach on-prem resources unless it’s via the “connector” and that can be locked down according to your heart’s content.. meanwhile all traffic destined outside of your network has the benefit of being secured by this cloud firewall.
 My question is, have any of you transitioned to a solution like this as a full-on replacement to traditional remote access vpn? What was your driver in doing so? (Checking a box for zero trust strategy? Eliminating the overhead of managing the remote access vpn infrastructure? (Patching appliances, renewing certificates, keeping client software version current, etc). Because a case study showed this was genuinely more secure than a traditional remote access vpn?)
 My other question os what are the shortcomings? Issues encountered, etc? I’m already thinking of an interactive app we use in our network that probably won’t work with this, since it establishes old school RTP sessions to endpoints.. so any stateful device sees two different sessions, one from endpoint, one to endpoint… I’m skeptical this will successfully traverse the “connector” proxy..
 Any other thoughts? Is this just another marketing fad and it’s really just over glorified “cloud firewall?” Or is this pretty much the future? Maybe I’m completely missing the point on what SASE actually is and why it is? I’m eager to hear your thoughts and opinions on this!

How are spammers and attackers in a CGNAT network traced or identified?
 
Do the Internet providers of the networks keep track of the traffic from each individual user, or just the traffic that is generated inside the CGNAT network as a whole.
 
 The ISP’s haven’t been really helpful, since most of their helpdesk employees aren’t very tech savvy. Thank you in advance :)

The program runs fine when we launch it on workstations within our main building using a batch command that calls the program through a shared drive. However, we're running into issues when we try to launch the program on remote hosts outside of our second building and over VPN.
 When we run the batch command in these situations, we can see active connections to the server over SMB, but the program doesn't actually launch on the remote host. It's as if the Java connection isn't going over the WAN/VPN. We've already reached out to our network team, server team, and the vendor, but nobody has been able to provide a solution yet.
 We've checked our firewall settings, network settings, and DNS settings, but haven't found any issues there. We've also tried running the program directly on the remote host, but that didn't work either.
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm sure this has been discussed here ad-naseum, but here goes nothing
 Have any (or all) of you experienced the pain of being forced to implement a system due to poor research, lack of communication, lack of knowledge, and just not understanding the existing systems implementation by a top level manager?
 How did you deal with it? I'm so tired of having to remind people who should know better that, in this day and age (old man yells at cloud), all major businesses are IT focused. Everything that deals with communications, advertising, data processing, analytics, word processing, email, all of the business rules, are related, if not directly under, technology. The business is an IT company providing services through technology.
 If anything tech related goes south fast, money stops flowing. 
 Communications? Lost money. Email down? Lost money. Shitty business rules? Lost money. Bad system purchases? Lost money.
 When will it be common knowledge that everything in a business relies on IT, infrastructure, database management, networking, backups, yadda yadda yadda.
 To the VPs who make 3 times as much as the poor bastards being forced to make a square peg fit in a round hole, being told that "well others are doing it, you just need to learn", being pulled in 15 directions because your word document emergency is more important than project progress: the business is an IT business that provides a market service. All of it. 
 Thinking of trying to integrate a sweet, shiny, and slick constant contact suite? IT
 New company policy that affects payments? Include IT
 Considering purchasing new monitors? Include IT
 Key cards? Include IT
 Entire systems? Include IT
 Reporting software? Include IT
 New building? Include IT

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey crew,
 I read a post on here a while back asking how one can reasonably use Power Apps to help alleviate some IT admin tasks, where one specific request was how to create new users with Power Apps. Since I was learning Power Apps development anyway, I took it upon myself to do create a "User Administration" app, so that HR for example could create new users and assign them to groups, without help from the IT department. I now hate Power Apps and Microsoft and my life. 
 Power Apps is clunky, tedious to develop in, and the licensing makes neither logical nor business sense when one realizes that all the "good" features are premium and Power Apps for Teams is the cut-rate model.
 All my bitching aside, the app is done, and I have thoroughly documented (no bullshit YouTube videos, I promise) the process of:
  
Creating an App using the free built-in connectors to MS365/Azure AD
 Realizing that these connectors won't cut it and redoing everything with premium connectors
 Getting the app finished and ready for y'all to download
  
I hope y'all find my experience or app helpful and if you would like to try to implement something like this in production, please let me know, and I will help if I can. Thanks r/sysadmin, my favorite, commiserating subreddit!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am wondering if this is a familiar story.
 Few months back we had an urgent ticket come in, estates had installed some expensive new building management (BMS) kit and now needed all the sensors networked in, some in really funky locations - think underground access conduits and roof spaces. Obviously without any heads up to IT. Not a simple fix, and thus it's one of those calls that emails start getting cc'd to directors and people are getting angry.
 So we run with it and design where we need to run new fibre, what devices we will place where, well documented and scope done, but because of the complications in this work (think drilling a couple of 6" reinforced concrete walls that are both firestops and holding up a 5 story building above) we pass back the documents to estates (who have qualified surveyors) and say can you can you please manage and implement.
 That was 6 months ago and nothing happened.
 Doesn't bother me, not my issue if project happens or not, but the underlying issue is just the expectations people have outside of IT, but never expect the same elsewhere.
 Off to make a coffee.

Walked in today (03/21) and no emails were working - program that was downloaded on users computer to automatically convert Outlook profiles didn’t work. My first ever time doing it - Office 2019 we just had to restart a few hundred computers and the program would pop up to configure the profile (not suppose to require a restart anyways) Office 2016 users we had to apply latest patch, then restart and the program would work to configure new profile. I’ve been having to tell people to use the OWA until I can get to them. Then found out that Microsoft is having 365 admin issues on top of it. I did not think it would be this hard. All this is a hit or miss operation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. Last year I got a new job as IT Specialist for an engineer company that has grown at an incredibly fast pace in recent years. The biggest problem I’m facing right now is that there is no central management for our endpoints and nobody seems to care: the general mentality in many respects has remained that of the family business.
 Since the company is constantly growing, now we have more than 250 endpoits to manage without an MDM, and most employees have the possibility to work remotely 2 days a week.
 We have mainly Windows 10-11 PCs, a couple of Macs, a dozen iPads and 70 Android phones.
 Is there a way to manage this all in some MDM with software management? 
 I looked into intune/endpoint manager since we are already using Microsoft 365 services with hybrid Azure AD join.
 I also need to deploy Autodesk apps (such as Autocad and Revit) on 40% of the Windows devices, and I was wondering if there is an MDM that is better suited for this task.
 Thanks in advance for your help.

 I’m looking for best practices and any guides that will help me along the journey of enabling AD sync between this on prem .local domain and our Azure AD counterpart. Of course, I’d like it to go as smoothly as possible.
 Once the domains are synchronised, how does it deal with those users who have different attributes. For example, if a local domain user is showing as in department A, and the O365 user with the same username is in department B, which department wins?

 Oh and lastly I know the Windows clients can add them via IP of course. But I'd rather not do that in-case the IP changes, as well as other reasons like making it easier for people to identify servers.

 Windows 11 for General Client Use (here's where "or more" come into play, there may be many clients, all of which should see the same user experience.) - 192.168.5.30
  
I can set up these three in Hyper-V such that they'll ping each other, and that I can map a network drive from the Win11 Server Access PC to view the contents on C:\ of the Server 2019. I will be setting up an Internal Switch for this.
 My Client General Use Computers, lets say I wanted to block www.latimes.com (just picking a site, nothing against LA Times), how can I network my computers, such that my Client Computers won't be able to access this website?
 The question is not, how do apply the block. I'll get to that later.
 Which one of these PCs actually accesses the Internet for that client? Is it #1, #2 or #3? I need that process explained to me and how to network it properly, or at the very least, a link that explains it well for a beginner.
 I am comfortable using Command Prompt, even more comfortable with Powershell (preferred)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Newer network engineer in the ISP world.
 I am at a smaller fiber ISP. We are trying to figure out the best way to calculate our network availability/reliability percentage for when subscribers or businesses ask.
 What scope would we use to define our availability? Entire network outages where no subscribers have access? Would we calculate for all nodes then average them?
 We have small outages all the time from fiber damage so would we count every single one of those?
 What should be included or excluded? Any thoughts would be great.

Would be working as part of a team, primarily managing and maintaining systems in their data center, managing O365/AzureAD, assisting with escalated tickets, and I'm sure a ton more.
 I'm currently an Azure Admin for a large MSP, and have been for a little over 2 years now, this job will require me to move back into an on-premise environment and learn VMWare. I'm not opposed to this, but just not sure if it would be a step-down, and I certainly would miss Azure. Job is hybrid, 2–3 days a week in office, I'm currently fully remote. Would be a 15% percent raise.
 Have a slight obsession with theme parks/roller coasters, so I do think this would be a cool position to have, with some opportunity to assist with system and network design for ride operations + the park in general.
 Anyone ever worked IT in the amusement industry? How bad is it?

We're in the home stretch of implementing a new ERP system consisting of various Windows Server 2019 VMs hosted on a Windows 2019 Hyper-V cluster. The vendor "requires" sub-0.500ms network response times between the component servers (SQL, web front-end, etc). We're far exceeding their IOPS specs for disk, so that's not a concern whatsoever.
 Am I the only one that feels this network latency requirement is unrealistic? I'm currently attaining values ~0.700ms, even between VMs on different hosts. I barely get sub-0.500ms response times between 2 Cisco network switches with a 100Gb interconnect.

 For example, when using conversation view and have 'Subject' field in the 2nd column, for every item in there the name of the subject is not repeated. However, if subject is in the 3rd column, the subject name is repeated for every item.
  
 Why does it do this and how can I make it so it doesn't repeat for every item in the chain?
 Similarly, can I force that behavior (to not repeat) if I'm using the 'Task Subject' instead of the normal Subject field?

 Need a tool that will visualization our network by grabbing our pfsense firewall/NAT rules and generating some sort of visualization.
 I know I can pull the xml configs of the firewall/NAT rules off pfsense but trying to figure out a good tool in order to parse that and visualize it.
 Our ISSO wants to have something in order to review and see which systems have outside connections coming in to them from the internet and over what ports.
 They asked us to look into Redseal, which seems to be capable of doing this but comes with a $60k price tag to it, which is way too high for what little we need it to do.
 We do not need a SIEM, Vuln scanner, CIS/SCAP benchmark tool, SOC analytics or anything else Redseal seems to offer. 
 Anyone have any suggestions? I haven't used python before to parse xml and visualize it into something but i'm sure it's been done before or there's something like this...somewhere lol. Just not sure where!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are we the only ones running into this? Several times, and with several different versions, we have been getting our Fortigate firewalls' virus scanning getting tripped by direct-from-Cisco IOS-XE downloads (specifically, 17.3.7, 17.6.4, and 17.6.5 for various sizes of 9800 WLCs and the 9300 switches) for "W32/MalformedType.PE!dam". 
 Fortinet insists that this is damaged malware according to their website, but - having pulled it down to a VM and scanned it with several tools and run a checksum on it - is absolutely a match for what Cisco lists for SHA512 checksum and comes back clean.
 I'm expecting to need to do battle with the InfoSec dragon on Monday, and I'd like to find out if anyone else is seeing this (or has seen similar in the past). I'm expecting it's a false positive on Fortinet's part given nothing else has tripped on scans, but certain individuals on the InfoSec team can be somewhat stubborn, and I can't choose who to go to on this one.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Not a sysadmin, but I handle some tickets for a lot of low-level items on the business side. Usually one ticket with many low-level items, i.e. 5 low-level items, one ticket. These low-level items are essentially different workstreams that can be blocked based on another user. Essentially, there are cases where 3 low-level items are cleared, but we still have 2 remaining, so the ticket isn't closed on our side. This causes a never-ending build-up. 
 Seeing as this sub probably deals with tickets, I wanted to see if there's an efficient way to deal with this. I can't play cat and mouse with the users forever, going into each ticket and firing off email reminders to clear their item, so I can clear mine. I also can't police the users to only have 1 item per ticket, it's not feasible.
 The only thing I can think about to combat this is to track these items at the lowest level in Excel, then automate a weekly reminder via Power Automate. Is this the right approach, something better out there?

 We have a group policy for MS Office that is being enforced at the domain level. There are a couple settings in there that I think are currently breaking some things, so I applied a test group policy with the opposite configurations to a test OU where I've placed a few computers. 
 My understanding is that the group policy should apply in the order of local -> site -> domain > OU. So even though I have the test group policy applied at the test OU the computer resides in, when I check inheritance for the test OU, the MS Office policy is taking precedence over my test policy, even after enforcing my test policy. Office policy is like #11 in the list of precedence whereas mine is in the mid 30s. 
 The inheritance seems to have everything at domain/site above the OU policy, which is contrapositive to what I thought I knew about GP. 
 What am I missing?

 My time has finally come to post here! I am seeking advice on how I should approach the following situation:
 Recently, I was offered two separate administration positions. Unfortunately, both of them are solo admins, meaning I would be the only "IT" person on site. This worries me due to my limited experience..
 For some background, I am graduating with a CS degree in less than a month, and have been working at a tier 1 IT helpdesk the past two years, and I feel like I am not ready to move into this admin position because of the lack of guidance.
 I would say I have intermediate knowledge in Networking, scripting, and virtualization topics, but have very beginner level knowledge in administration.
 What should I do??
 ​
 Edit:
 If anyone has some resources for anything administration related, I would be grateful if you shared with me :)
 ​
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For days we've had this issue of folder redirection breaking 10 or so minutes after users logged in. It started with one user, then two, and soon it became a large handful. Multiple engineers were baffled and threw in the towel.
 Today, I sat down and was determined to figure it out. After 4 hours of analysing event logs and intense Googling, I got it; the file server IP and hostname don't match in DNS. 
 The previous tech managing this environment before my company took over had no idea what he was doing. Because of this, there are configurations that at best make no sense, and at worst are dangerous. In this case, the file server had a static IP that's inside a DHCP range, so a client took over its IP causing the mismatch.
 Releasing the IP, extending the exclusion range and recreating the server's A record fixed the issue. I know there are other ways of sorting it, but with the random exclusion ranges already present, this was the safest option.
 It's Friday, I've had a long week, and this took the last bit of energy I had, but man do I feel powerful for figuring it out! 
 Just wanted to share this little victory. Have a good weekend guys.

 I’m afraid I know the answer to this but I need to ask just so I can go home for the weekend knowing I asked:
 I’m trying to Install an ARM MSI from GPO (that enough initials for everyone?). When I try to add the MSI I get “Unable to deploy package. The package does not support a Windows compatible platform.” I assume it’s because the server is an x64. I’m trying to deploy settings for some machines running Win11 on M1 Macs in Parallels, and other settings so far are ok. I figured this would be too since the GPO just points the client to the MSI on the network, and it doesn’t actually need to run on the server, but I guess it doesn’t like that it’s an ARM package.
 There’s not some magical checkbox or setting buried somewhere I’m missing to get around this, is there? The x64 version of the same installer works fine.
 Thanks.

They are wired and connected to a network switch (Aruba 1930) which is being tethered off another switch. All of the access points are connected to these switches and all 11 that were already here are working perfectly and everything is connected to the same network. I can not get the new access points to connect to the Aruba virtual controller. I add the MAC addresses, a checksum error pops up for a couple seconds then goes away. At this point there are no errors showing but the AP's stay red and don't seem to connect to the mesh configuration.
 What do I need to do to get these to work?

 I took a packet capture on my PC after working hours and I found a very high amount of multicast traffic. The capture was for 22 seconds and 63% of all packets were MDNS from other Mac devices in the network (1600 packets) and this is after working hours.
 ​
 Meraki has an option at the switch level to Enable or Disable "Flood unknown multicast traffic". Currently, we have it as "enabled" and I am not sure what it could break if I put it in "Disabled".
 ​
 Are you guys blocking multicast traffic in large WIFI deployments? What is your approach to this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a large task of reaching out to shared mailboxes that are still on prem in the effort to get rid of on prem exchange.
 ​
 I was thinking of doing the following -
 Set up power automate flow:
 Send Email to shared mailbox "hello, we are determining if this mailbox is in use or not, please response yes / no Yes(requires business justification and your name etc)
 ​
 If yes -> log response in sharepoint list
 If no -> log response in sharepoint list, marked for deletion etc
 ​
 ​
 Anyone ever have to do a project like this? Does my line of thinking make sense in terms of automation or is there a better method.
 ​
 Thanks

 I was having some wrist pains, due to my old chairs arm rests not being in line with my desk, and my wrists being at awful angle. New chair fixed my wrist pain, but the lumbar support is awful in it. I sat in the chair, for at least 30 minutes before buying, first 3 days this week where good. However, Thursday and today my lower back is in pain. It’s not even 11AM today, and my lower back hurts already.
 I was hoping to return it, and replace it with something better. I know Herman Millers/Steelcase are expensive, but I need something that’s better supporting.
 In anyone’s experience, are those chairs worth the $$$$$? My biggest ask in another new chair are, adjustable arm rests, good lumbar support, comfortable for all day work.
 Thanks for your recommendations!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Guys,
 I have been given the greenlight to start the automation journey for our current organization and go from zero network automation to hero. It is a mix of brownfield for our current devices and any future deployments can be considered greenfield.
 There is a TON of resources out there on how to use all of the network automation tools/frameworks but not much information on common pitfalls and how to properly scale the network automation operation so it doesn't blow up in your face.
 So my question to folks who have been down this journey.
  
Can you describe your current workflow?
 What does the lifecycle of provisioning a brand new device look like ?
 How do you handle network changes such as adding a new VLAN to a switch and keeping the source of truth/variables updated with this information?
 Are you constantly polling the device and comparing it to the intended state? How are you handling a mismatch from the intended vs what is on the device ?
 Are you pushing changes made in the source of truth to the device in your workflow?
 How are you handling multiple sources of truth ? 
  
I'm aware this is really dependent on the tools/skills available to the organization, hoping to get some inspiration and ideas how other orgs are doing their automation.
 Thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So as I'm reading this release/heads-up from MS about them turning on MFA as the security default in our/everyone's tenant in a couple of weeks, I'm a little concerned.
 I fully understand why they are doing it as a default - just the "right" security policy and takes (some) of the liability off of their plate. However, MFA will just simply not work for a lot of our staff. The bulk of our staff don't need multifactor to just open their email. Half of them can't even have their phones out at their desks due to client requirements nor do they have any ability to access email/system outside of the office itself.
 I'm by no means a "system admin" (more of a jack of all trades but master of none) but I'm the version of that in our office. I'm assuming that I can reverse this new default setting when MS flips the switch so we stay how we currently are set up - those that require remote access have MFA and those that do require remote access do not have MFA.
 Any help/direction you can provide will help settle my nerves. 
 Thanks.

 We want to be able to move a base list of Contacts to the user's phone/Personal Outlook Contacts so that when users text/call it comes up with said employee's name.
 What we do currently is during account creation we log in as the user into OWA and just import a CSV of the base list so it populates down to the iPhone when signed into the email.
 Is there a way to better automate this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I run a stream of the 90s Weather Channel using a software simulator. It's been on an Intel NUC, which has shown its age and is a bit noisy when the fan is going. I figured I'd upgrade and found a fanless thin client, an HP T620, for cheap. I figured I could just set it in write mode, install the programs I needed, then disable write mode and have it get going. Only issue is that in write mode, it only exposes about 250mb of C: - not enough for OBS and storing music. 
 I can't for the life of me find HP documentation on the T620 - everything seems to be a dead link. Is there any guide or documentation that people know of on how I can enable writes to the full 64gb storage capacity? Last time I did this, I was sysadminning a Citrix Xendesktop environment, and I used Citrix's console to create image versions as VHDs, cracked them open in Hyper-V, made my changes, and merged them in for the thin clients to boot to the image, but this is at drastically smaller scale and scope.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company has around 18TB of legal hold data we've gathered over the years that we cannot delete yet.
 The data: * Is stored on-site on an older Netapp we want to get rid of * Consists of exported PST's, network drive folders, and Windows PC HDD images
 The same senior people tend to get looped into multiple cases, so all of this data duplicates in half down to 9TB on disk with Netapp's deduplication.
 We want to move the data off the Netapp and securely store it in the cloud somewhere. The data is very rarely read. I would prefer to be able to keep a copy on site, but we'd need to purchase some new storage to accommodate for that.
 Any recommendations on inexpensive hardware (not a custom build, needs ~NBD coverage) for storing this data on-site and for services to securely store this data in the cloud?

 I was thinking maybe there's some type of service or local agent that can install to monitor this
 I basically want to be alerted if the mail flow for a specific account is not working connected to this internal relay 
 the relay is available only internally so I can't use an external service to monitor the specific IP and port
 Ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello r/sysadmin community!
 I'd like to share with you a project I've been working on, called NetAtlas C2 Server Search. It's a Java-based utility designed to detect Command and Control (C2) servers using the Netlas API. The tool offers a simple and user-friendly CLI interface for searching C2 servers, leveraging the Netlas API to gather data and process it locally.
 ![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/Q0g0ego8SK97elJvTHN5IXLzs.svg)
 To get started, you'll need a Netlas API key, which you can obtain from the Netlas website. Once you have your API key, you can use the c2detect command to search for servers:
 bash c2detect -t <TARGET_DOMAIN> -p <TARGET_PORT> -s <API_KEY> [-v] 
 This project is available on GitHub, and you can find the full README file with detailed usage instructions, Docker support, and a list of supported C2 servers there.
 If you'd like to contribute or have any feedback, please feel free to create a pull request or leave a comment. I hope you find this tool helpful in your sysadmin tasks!
 Happy hunting!

 we have a lot of devices that are registered several times in azure with the same device/computer name.
 Basically I think that every time someone else logs onto that computers and uses office 365 with their account it's creating a new device in Azure...
 I'm fairly sure that's not how it's supposed to be, because it's called "device" and not "device/user link".
 I have found a particular device that's 16 times in azure...
 we have more than 1300 "stale devices" because of this.
 Does anyone has any insight of to prevent this and/or why this is happening ?
 ​
 Thanks in advance !

 I have a RDP certificates deployed from an Root CA with now invalid OCSP location in the AIA. Connecting to every hosts now takes obviously more to check the invalid OCSP address. I would deploy additional valid RDP certificates, but I am unsure how it handles both certificates. If I am correct, then it won't bother to check expired certs.
 But would it check all RDP certs if they are not expired and then of course still complain about the invalid OCSP?
 I would hope that it somehow is satisfied with one completely valid RDP cert.
 With RDP certificate I mean a certificate with enhanced key usage of value "1.3.6.1.4.1.311.54.1.2"

 I have two buildings around 300ft apart and have 2 separate systems that need connectivity between the buildings.
 Each of the 2 systems is provided by a different vendor. They each have provided a pre-configured router that gets installed at building A, and each have provided a pre-configured WiFi AP that gets installed at building B. Each vendor has also supplied gear for a point-to-point WiFi bridge.
 I can’t avoid having the 2 routers or the 2 WiFi AP’s due to the preconfigured nature, but is there a way I can avoid having the 2 point-to-point links and use a single point to point link instead?
 I’m thinking I would need a managed switch at each end, setup VLANs, and connect the point-to-point equipment to a trunk port on the switches.
 Open to suggestions!

 We were buying Vostro laptops during the shortages and we'd send so many back within a few months. Poor quality hinge connection on the lids, keyboard and trackpad issues, audio device failure (happened to at least 10 machines), camera failure, and so on. And even the ones that survived are slowly dying
 But the Latitude machines still seemed to be good. We'd never sent one back, and the only warranty claim we'd made was for a failed hard drive many years ago. Fast forward to today and I've now had to have two Latitude laptops repaired, one needed a motherboard replacement before I even had it deployed, and another was deployed for a week before the charger jack mysteriously stopped working
 Utterly useless and terrible quality

 I was thinking of setting up a locally hosted dashboard that would replace the homepage (which is just set to the company website) where there would be "bookmarks" that takes you to notable items within the company like: ERP login, SharePoint, Office, Homepage, etc.. limitless potential. You could ask yourself why not just have standard bookmarks, but my response to that is; this would be cooler.
 As this would be locally there is the problem that while not connected to the local infrastructure or VPN it would not necessarily work, there might be a way to throw in a failsafe somewhere that just redirects to the homepage or something, i have not thought that far yet.
 So please Tech people of reddit, is this the most idiotic idea you have heard or is it a cool/semi good idea?

 The company I work for under went a restructure (make a load of redundancies and play chess to fill roles that are required but no manpower exists for, leading to a massive workload for everyone).
 An infrastructure engineer was bumped up to IT Team Manager, as well as several duties that the now non-existant Director of IT and Security did as well as QA tasks.
 There is no focus at all on automation, in fact if anything, we are unautomating things due to "cost saving benefit" (man hours does not seem to be a concern). 
 The manager is pushing back against cloud migration (despite it being wanted by the board by a certain date). We have plenty of sy…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While I'm a seasoned unix and network administrator with 30 years experience, I'm not into global internetworking and I don't really want to be, normally I don't care what happens after the default route my ISP gives me, but I now suddenly have to and the more I read about BGP, ASNs etc, the more confused I am, so please bear with me ;)
 We are a relatively small company whose managed hoster of 15 years just terminated the contract ("We no longer fit into their business model", I guess they couldn't bullshit enough money out of us, but anyway, irrelevant...) , so now I have ended up with a bunch of IP ranges (smaller than /24, so I can't take them with me) entered into dozens of firewalls either as ACLs or as IPSec VPN endpoints, that I now have to change, and all of which are in big enterprises where changes take weeks, if not months to push through the middle management layer.
 OK, I'll have to go through all the pain and renumber once, but how do I prevent not to have to do it again if or when similar thing happens again? The scenario would be that when moving between hosters, I would duplicate the environment (i.e. firewalls) and then just flip the route announcements and the traffic switches within minutes and If I did everything correctly I do not have to do anything on the customer side. How realistic is this expectation?
 Do I need an ASN to fully own an IP range? In RIPE requirements (we are in the EU) it says you have to be multihomed to get one, but we are nothing yet as we haven't picked the new hoster yet ;) Or am I doing things in the wrong order, first I have to pick a hoster and then get the range. What do I have to ask the potential hosting candidates to be sure the plan is going to work? How does one own an IP range, is it tied to a person, organization, ASN? How does one move it around between hosters?

 Edit: To clarify, we’re a single device laptop shop so staff plug and unplug several times a week as they take laptops home or bring them onsite (we’re hybrid). Ideally the solution would be somewhat aesthetically pleasing but effective.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are a growing healthcare company, recently expanding from 200 users to 350 users in the past couple of years. Up until now we have had a small IT department consisting of four techs who share all responsibilities, from help desk to equipment installs to device configurations to facilities work and vendor support.
 It has been increasingly difficult to manage projects and maintain our infrastructure due to how many hats we wear, the lack of staffing, and the constant interruptions of day to day issues. This has led to us experiencing a cyber attack and the loss of two of our staff due to burnout and the inability to keep up. 
 The company has managed to bounce back, but I am not seeing any signs of slowing down and we are still meagerly staffed and I can sense another implosion on the horizon. 
 But I’m getting too far ahead of myself. I guess my main question is - how do we structure our IT department as a growing company to assure we are staffed and handling issues correctly? I know we are going to need dedicated help desk staff, network technician, security officer, applications support, a manager, a sys admin, etc. - but what are the actual standards for a company from 300-500 employees? Is four IT staff enough? And what roles should they be divided into?
 I feel we are not organized and divided and staffed correctly, and since our current IT manager has zero IT knowledge, I want to see if I can gather some ideas to float up to higher management to get us the help we need before something major happens again due to lack of coverage/support and high burnout.

 I use RealVNC for remote access to computers around the house. It's free and works great.
 The two I would like to use the most at home is Auvik (network discovery, mapping, and built-in console/ssh) and ITGlue (device documention). I currently use nothing similar to Auvik and a simple Excel spreadsheet for device models, serial numbers, warranties, and similar.
 I'm considering using AssetTiger for documenting devices, but curious if there's anything else out there that would work better. I'm ok with self hosted as well!

The cut sheet has no tunnel IPs but when I asked I was referred to the cut sheet. I assumed this meant that I am to use an IP in a provided /28. 
 I went ahead with the configuration, created the requisite proposal, policy, keyring, profiles (one for ikev2, one for ipsec), and transform-set. I also configured a tunnel interface and assigned an IP and the aforementioned range. That didn't work so I tried the next, then another, and another. No luck.
 So I asked for a meeting with the third party. Expressed my concern about not having an IP address to assign to the tunnel, it was met with "well your NAT IPs...." and he lost me. 
 I'm not sure if it's my ignorance or his, but I don't know what to ask or Google at this point. I have read several configuration guides, all referencing an IP assigned to the tunnel. I opened a TAC case and reviewed my configuration with the engineer, their determination, you need an IP assigned to the tunnel. 
 My question for the group, have you ever seen a configuration like this?

 Tl;Dr what is your time management strategy?
 I'm a recent sysadmin supervisor after over a decade in service desk management plus a year as a sysad, and I'm struggling to juggle everything that needs to get done. I'm hoping to get some sage advice. 
 I am working for a company that had a 3-man IT department two years ago but experienced rapid growth and are now up to 15 IT folks for 200 end users. There's a lot that needs to get done. We're taking this place from a ma and pa shop to an enterprise-level IT environment from the ground up, and need to do it quickly due to auditing requirements. 
 I've been working 12+ hour days every day without a break other than rushing to the restroom, and it's still not enough. My calendar is booked in 15 minute increments for 2-3 weeks out at all times, with more being dropped on my lap every day. My two sysads are junior-level and struggle with most items, so I have to dedicate at least an hour every day to get them in a position to tackle their responsibilities.
 I average 6 meetings a day (my team, my boss, other IT departments, project managers, and vendors), plus project work, ticket escalations, emergency vulnerabilities, and any other random stuff that pops up. I'm stressed. My team is stressed. They keep threatening to quit and so I spend my lunch break every day helping them organize and prioritize and try to make sure they have everything they need. 
 I started meeting every 2 weeks with the CTO and my boss to adjust priorities as needed, but it has only helped me to meet due dates rather than be chronically late. He says that they don't have the budget to hire another sysad right now. 
 Finding another job isn't an option - I tried, and after applying to nearly 100 jobs I only received two offers for 20k less than I'm making now.
 Please help me. I'm at the end of my rope here. How do you do it? What's the secret?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[What's up, y'all?
 We're moving from on-prem server room to DC colo. We have a modest video distribution business with respectable storage and connectivity needs. Part of this move is scaling up, including storage, transcoding capacity and (tada) connectivity.
 We have a legacy FC network connected to a legacy SAN. The rest of the LAN runs on 1GbE. The LAN is upgraded to 25/100G.
 Our internet connectivity has been 1Gbps and we've been saturating it regularly. Looking to move up to 10Gbps in the colo. We average about 50TB of traffic in/out with our current firewall and connectivity. We won't have many users on this new network, primarily receiving file-based video, processing, and sending file-based deliverables out to endpoints.
 We're upgrading our entire networking stack with a life of at least 5 years before revisiting.
 Our new network build is:
  
Supermicro NAS with Mellanox Connectx-5 2x 100G ports
 Supermicro Top of Rack Switch with 48 x 25G SFP28 and 6 x 100G QSFP28
 Mellanox 25G x 2 cards on the transcoders, workstations, and distribution server back to the switch
  
The LAN side is pretty much done, but we're looking for firewall options that will offer at least 10G on the LAN to come up from our core switch and 10G on the WAN to fully utilize contracted bandwidth.
 We've considered building out our own box, but prefer to have an appliance with commercial support.
 We've looked at products from these vendors:
  
FortiNet (100F)
 Ubiquiti
 Netgate
 Mikrotik
  
These vendors seem to offer solutions within our budget (medium enterprise with good feature sets). Would appreciate some firewall recommendations from these vendors, to compare with what we've evaluated, and any others that we may not be considering that would fit.
 Thanks!

However, we have a very strong wireless Netwerk throughout this property and I’d like to use Wi-Fi for this. I’m finding several consumer type devices that can bridge. The Wi-Fi connection over to ethernet, but I’m not seeing any Enterprise or more business class devices. The consumer devices I’m finding are more wireless repeaters with an ethernet port built-in, and I definitely don’t want any wireless repeaters on my network. Is anyone else aware of a product that can help with this?

The Store seems to update when apps are in-use (or at least Windows is in use), but some computers go a long time before somebody uses them, but we'd still like to go ahead and have those apps get their updates. Can this be scheduled? or controlled via a GPO? We've already enabled "automatic updates" in the store via GPO but that isn't enough for all computers regardless of usage.

 It looks like that (I don't really care in showing the values)Cloudflare DNS dashboardPic of DNS propagation checker
 And my nameservers are set up correctly, pointing to the domains that Cloudflare gave me
 Did I fucked something up when deleting the records? If so, I can't tell what's wrong.
 Sorry for asking for help, but really IDK where else to ask for something like this
 And no, I am not hosting any kind of prohibited content, it's just CNAMEs pointing to docs of some projects of mine and for a few web apps (with API)
 EDIT: FIXED IT!!
 I had a loop in SSL redirects, like the browser requests in HTTPS to Cloudflare, Cloudflare turns into HTTP and forwards the request to my hosting, the hosting tries to force HTTPS by redirecting back to HTTPS and so the loops continues. I just had to go into SSL/TLS (on the Cloudflare panel) and change from Flexible to Full.
 This loop probably was crashing the websites that track propagation

 I guess red is too aggressive of a color.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Network traffic security Traffic goes from the gateway to Azure Relay to the Power BI backend cluster. This traffic doesn't traverse the public internet. All Azure internal traffic goes over the Azure backbone.
 Context: So we have an on premises DB which we are going to connect to Power BI cloud service. The connection is going to be established by placing MS on-premises data gateway app on a Windows server on our network. The on premises data gateway app will establish an outbound connection via 443 with Azure relay which further connects to Power BI cloud service. The above statement is from their doc. It is essentially mentioned that the traffic will not traverse public internet. But how could that be possible? Because Azure relay is in in an Azure region and on premises data gateway is in our DC. Wouldn’t the traffic between them go through the internet via 443? Are they mentioning that Azure internal traffic doesn’t traverse the public internet and makes use of Azure backbone? I’m really having a hard time wrapping my head around this. Can someone please explain the traffic flow in this scenario. I’ll be highly indebted to you for explaining this. I do however understand that traffic will be encrypted from gateway to Azure relay but will it be over the internet? Or how does it work. They say this traffic doesn’t traverse the public internet. But relay is in azure and gateway is in our network :(
 Below is the doc link:

 Since receiving that chassis, Aruba has discontinued the V1 chassis and cancelled the outstanding items in our order. 
 They are suggesting we order a 6405 v2 chassis to vsf pair with the first chassis.
 Has anyone built a VSF stack of 6405 or 6410 chassis with 1x V1 chassis and 1x v2 chassis? Has anyone tried/tested ISSU with this configuration?
 I feel like this is too guinea pig of a scenario to want to put into production. Having a mix of different chassis versions in a VSF cluster seems like I'm asking to be bug-testing for the duration of this lifecycle.

 We have a user who gets this message: "We cannot render a new actionable message right now. Please close an existing one in Microsoft Outlook and retry."
 When I search what an actionable message is, it shows an accept or decline type of email or mail that have those type of interactive actions. But my co-worker says she didn't engage with any email like that, so I'm not sure where the issue lies.
 I have already tried to rebuild OST, and make a new outlook profile but the problem persists.
 Is there any way to stop this message?
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For some background, we currently have to ADs as we are migrating. I will explain more later 
 I have a continuing issue with two users with office and using an application called Aria that work with office
 The ticket came in saying Aria had an error “command is not available” when trying to open a document. When opening office it says the license is inactive up at the top for both users. However for one of them when I had them try to sign in again they get a tpm error. (He has not been in the office so have not done any more troubleshooting with him)
 For the user who wasn’t getting tpm error here’s what I tried -removed account in school/work account setting He was then able to get into office fine. When opening up aria though he was able to open a document, then it would ask for his office email, he entered it, the it would freeze. 
 Now, I am not very familiar with Aria (though I believe this is a problem with office) but sometimes if we have a user log back in in our old domain then open Aria and then log back in our new domain Aria works. (It has to populate in the old domain). I go to do that and I get the same license issue with office(no tpm error) try removing account in school/work account setting, still doesn’t work. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, removed local file in app date and the launched again. Still nothing. 
 Last couple of things -version of office is 16.016130.20394 -both users work fine and have no issues on other PCs + verified they have valid licenses. 
 I’ve asked everyone on my team, endless googling and have gotten nowhere. User is getting frustrated so this is my last shot. 
 I’m a new help desk tech so please go easy on me if I’m missing something really dumb. Thanks in advanced for any help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I have some older 2520G (J9299A) switches that I would like to use in less critical parts of our network. The one hold up is that the wed interface still requires Java and is totally unusable. SSH is fine, but would like the web interface to be accessible as well.
 The switches are currently running a variant of the 14.XX firmware. From what I’ve seen on the Aruba downloads site, there is a 15.XX firmware available for these switches, and it specifically lists the J9299A model as supported in the firmware notes.
 I’m trying to update the switch with this firmware via XMODEM through the console port, but that’s not working like it has on other switches.
 Is there a better way that I should be doing this? Or is there not newer firmware for these switches like I think?
 Thanks for any input!

 I recently deployed this Teams Device as well as a companion touch screen to one of my clients, and after a few hiccups getting the Teams/Zoom firmware working correctly and getting the touchscreen properly paired it seemed to be a pretty nice solution in their conference room.
 Unfortunately, despite my testing without issue one of their primary users is finding the camera in the bar locks up when presenting a PP via her laptop while in a meeting.
 I have not been able to reproduce it myself, and do not have easy access to get hands-on as often as I'd like to.
 Has anyone come across any issues like this with a Yealink device? When the issue occurs it necessitates a complete hard reset of the device. 
 I'm already also working with their support, but they're China based and the time between updates is tedious.
 The firmware on both devices is latest and the Teams app has been recently updated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning all,
 Not sure if this will stay up, but I wanted to ask how you guys deal with having a boss who knows absolutely nothing about IT, and yet makes all of the decisions regarding IT.
 Some background: I work for a small municipal government as 1 of 2 IT techs. We fall under the Finance dept, so the Finance Director (FD) is our boss, and fills the role of IT Director. He knows nothing about IT, and looks at every issue through "cost-goggles" ie. what is the cheapest option and go with that.
 He also doesn't trust either myself or the other IT guy when we tell him information about our systems and what they need. He's extremely micromanaging, to the point that if we change the way the weekly update email is worded, we need to have three meetings with him before we can make the change.
 This is turning more into a rant than a question, but what would you guys recommend we do? I'd love to go to the city manager and say that we need an actual IT Director, but he likely wont listen, and also tell the FD about it, which will make our lives hell. I also can't go to HR, because the HR dept also falls under the FD.
 Any advice is much appreciated, thanks for your time, and have a wonderful Thursday!

 Dell, HP, they all do this. 
 In our experience here, 1 out of 10 of these laptops has problems with that image. So in the past, what we've done is just take any new machines we purchase, format the drives and do a fresh install of the OS with drivers. Then give it to the user.
 However, as we're growing, we're starting to get users in other countries. And it's impractical to order a laptop, (for example) from India, so it complies with export regulations. Ship it here. Format it, and ship it to the user.

 Here's how it was done before: people would print out the invoice, check if all entries are correct, put a stamp on it, and only then would it get scanned. 
 However, now the entire printing process will be eliminated. 
 Because of this, I have been looking for some software (preferably free, of course) that would help with this task. 
 For now, I have only thought of using a PDF editor and putting a "stamps" on it. But maybe there are some better options, so If you have any suggestions, I would love to hear them.

 maybe someone here can help me with our DNS configuration. I have an issue where the DNS entries for our Windows clients are incorrect. Specifically, the DNS entry is showing the IP address of the WiFi NIC of the client 90% of the time, even though the client is connected via cable. 
 The cause is likely that the clients are connecting to the network through a USB-C dock, and the WiFi connection is being established faster and therefore getting registered with DNS. But shouldn't the DHCP or the client automatically update the entry?

 With an attachment to the HTML, unfortunately I wasn't paying full attention and had already downloaded the html, but I never run it. Then immediately I deleted it again and then I downloaded it again but opened it in vscode and saw code that is fully obfuscated:

 If I try to use https://deobfuscate.io/, I get the following: var jamire = ["warn", "324758BZPRYz", "18MDJMtT"]; so they were probably building some webpage using this obfuscated array.
 Anyway, I'm writing it here to warn others + because I also saw this:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Heres the scenario , small team of 4. I'm on the helpdesk working under the helpdesk lead. Above us is Admin 1 and Admin 2.
 Sysadmin 2 died at my workplace.
 So admin 1 spend a bunch of money to outsources a lot of the security, networking and other maintenance and then tries to spread his projects to me on the helpdesk.
 I really don't want to absorb his projects without compensation and my boss knows this as I explained this to him but he tried to play it off like these projects are easy and don't take much to do and id be getting resume material. Some of them are manageable , as I absorbed handling the security training for our ~400 staff, all aging and in need of basic security knowledge. This alone seems like something worth compensating me for. There are more projects he wants me to do which feels like work i really need to be paid more to do. It requires coordinating with the vendors, purchasing software modules (so far we needed to spend like 12k on software modules for this project....), its expanding our systems capabilities, to me it is really a big project that I basically don't want to do. How do i navigate this fairly? Or what is to be expected here in other workplaces?
 Edit: thank you all for some perspective, my team and i have a good relationship overall. Id be very surprised if they wanted to get rid of me (especially after 1 staff member dying) so i think the best course of action is to rough it out with the project and hopefully secure a promotion in the future.

 I think it is:

 wait
 once the mailbox shows in 365 as shared remove the 365 licenses
  
But it seems the mailboxes in 365 don't always show as shared as it's been over an hour now and one still shows as user.

 I've googled every possible thing that could be added or configured to be blocking the casting to smart tvs from work domain joined laptops.
 I've checked what polices are inside the security settings, specifically for Wireless network (IEEE 802.3) and it is completely empty.
 I've tried opening the TCP and UDP ports that potentially allows Miracast to function.
 I'm still unsure if Miracast is the same thing as just "Cast" feature to any smart device, e.g smart tvs.
 Would love if anyone has an idea what other parts of the firewall Policy to check if it has something I can disable to allow casting?
 Thanks
 P.S* I'm new to the company with far more responsibility than my previous role and looking after the entire business on my own with not much guidance lol.

 I have a two part question which feels a bit silly but I'm not sure why things have been done this way.
 Microsoft Certificate Authority server has been configured but the web enrolment feature has not been added. Is there any reason why someone would not add this - a potential security risk perhaps? 
 The second question, how do I sign a custom certificate request without the web enrolment? I need a certificate with a specific dns name and also another alternative name, in the past Id create a csr and then sign it using the web enrolment 
 Because everything in my org is now hyper security paranoid I need to say whether having the web enrolment on is a risk and if it is I've no idea how to sign a certificate with custom names (this is all internal)
 Sorry for the clumsy question.

I tried using a GPO to silently enable, move, and sync, but it doesn't seem to work, possibly due to our use of a third-party MFA portal on 365 products. I am open to alternatives, even if they involve manually running a script on each user's laptop. If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know. all users are connected to a domain , i have remote access to everyone, so other than manually clicking on one drive and enabling the sync what other ways can i get through with this task.
 Thanks in advance

 I have to setup two new Linux servers for a new web-application. One should be for production environment and one for development and testing.
 I would start to setup the development environment, because for sure I will figure out that I need additional packages during development.
 But is there a method or a tool that helps me to setup the production server later exactly same like the dev-server? I mean same packages and so on?
 What is the best practice to handle server setup stuff?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Based on my past experience, Im leaning towards RAID 10. However, I have never implemented it with 12 drives, each with a capacity of 2TB, and I require close to 10TB of usable storage. 
 As this is a production machine with no cold spare drives, my inclination is to use 10 of the drives with RAID 10, which would provide roughly 10TB of usable storage, faster rebuild times, and the ability to tolerate the loss of 1 drive per RAID with a total loss of 2 drives. 
 Additionally, If have two spare drives available to replace any faulty ones due to only using 10 drives in the raid. Alternatively, I could opt for RAID 60, which would offer more usable space and still allow for the loss of 1 drive per RAID, but would result in slower rebuild times.
 What is peoples experience in this ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a client with a domain controller running on Windows Server 2016. This system was initially upgraded from an old SBS server which got obviously split into a DC and an Exchange Server. While this worked, it still got us stuck with some old domain scheme (I think it’s 2012 now), some old GPOs, settings and more. After a couple of years we’ve moved them to 365 using a hybrid solution for exchange and azure adconnect syncing the computers and users. 
 We’re now planning on replacing the local physical servers as they’re pretty old and thought about taking the opportunity to replace the DC server with a fresh DC Windows Server 2023, and ditch the old exchange server (which is basically turned off for quite some time now, but not removed). This will finally give us a clean environment with a updated domain schema, no old exchange servers.
 ​
 My biggest concerns are:
  
Keeping the users, data and configurations on O365 and connect it to the new environment.
 
Connecting the rest of the current servers to the new environment.
 
We’re also using Intune so would be nice to keep that working.
 
Keeping the domain name on O365 and local DC.
 
Making the whole transition as smooth as possible.
 
 ​
 Would appreciate any tips and ideas on how to approach this project, I'm sure some of you had to go through something similar. Thanks!

 We have two domain controllers running DHCP, each with two interfaces. Primary DC has 10.x.x.10 and 10.x.x.20 Secondary DC has 10.x.x.11 and 10.x.x.21
 Our Meraki's relay all DHCP discover packets to either the .20 or .21 interface, the rest of the DHCP handshake appears to go out the .10 or .11 interface.
 In this meeting that I was not invited to (I have a network engineering diploma and my CCNA) they decided to perform an audit of these latter two interfaces and decided that they weren't in use and to disable each interface. Obviously when I get in the morning I get a flood of tick…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I was wondering if I could get some assistance or pointed in the right direction with configuring two sonicwall devices as I am not the most familiar with these devices.
 My network is as follows: I have a set of WAPs that go into an unmanaged switch and into a TZ350 (FW1) on X0 to reach the internet. That works just fine. The private network is currently using 192.168.150.0/24
 We are switching ISPs and there is a NSA2700 (FW2) being added as well. Currently going through X15 on this sonicwall works fine as well.
 The issue that I am having is traffic will not want to flow from one interface to another.
 Right now it is WAP -> Switch -> FW1 -> ISP1
 And what I'm trying to do is WAP -> Switch -> X2 on FW1 -> X3 on FW1 -> x15 (DMZ) FW2 -> ISP2.
 I'm running into issues with getting any sort of traffic incoming on X2 to be shot out X3. I asked this question on spiceworks, but the things that were suggested did not seem to work. And one of the responses also seemed to be generated by chatgpt.
 If I can provide any additional information that would be of assistance, please let me know.
 Regards.

 A couple initial challenges are we use multiple MDMs and have multiple companies/locations: (for example, Company A uses AirWatch and Company B uses SOTI for transportation MDM. Company A and Company B both use Ivanti Avalanche for warehouse MDM). Our laptops and computers are currently managed on NAV (an absolute mess from what I've seen). Company B was recently acquired, and this is one note to resolve.
 Is it normal for Support needing to manage both separately (MDM for enrolling/updating, and a HAM for assigning, spare pool, etc)? Is there solutions that can help integrate together?
 We have a SAM tool that specialized in SaaS discovery, complexing licensing, and IT contracts, but doesn't have a HAM function. I'm considered discovery on ServiceNow for this, but I know that system can be a bull in a china shop and may be more than we need. Also like Freshservice's initial offerings.

 I would like to netboot a client from a different DHCP server. It is possible for me to specify which DHCP server to use on the client at PXE boot time?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I just got my Twitter API access notification today. We have a simple twitter feed widget on our digital signage
 At the top of the Enterprise sign up form (which is a Google Form for fuck sake) there is this statement:
  
DISCLAIMER: This is an Enterprise API tier application, which enables continued access to v1.1, v2 and additional Enterprise APIs. Pricing starts at $42,000 / Month based on usage and needs.
  
The digital signage widget only supports the v1.1 API and the basic tier only gives access to v2 as far as I can tell. 
 We also got notification from our web host that they are removing the twitter feed widget from their CMS. Apparently the quote they got from twitter to cover all of their customers would have required them to charge EACH CUSTOMER $10K PER MONTH. To display the last 10 tweets on our website. GTFO.
 Either Elon is actively trying to destroy twitter or he's so out of touch that he thinks companies are going to pay what amounts to extortion.
 I thought the whole purpose of charging for API access was to weed out the bots. Why is he charging for low volume pull requests too?
 Here's the enterprise form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScO3bczKWO2jFHyVZJUSEGfdyfFaqt2MvmOfl_aJp0KxMqtDA/viewform

 I was referred here from r/InformationTechnology
 Is there a specific Reddit for warning people to stay away from an IT equipment vendor or at least post my experience?
 I dealt with a vendor who accepted payment for items but never shipped us the order. After requesting a refund, they gave us excuse after excuse for 3 months as to why I hadn't received the refund. It wasn't until after I opened a case with the Attorney General's office of Pennsylvania that they refunded us our money. It was just over $4k they were paid for goods that were never delivered. The order was initially placed on December 6, 2022 and we didn't receive the refund until March 6, 2023.
 I want to warn everyone to stay away from Server Tech Supply of Prospect Park, PA. They also have a location in Woodbridge, VA

 Basically this will send app notification emails like Sharepoint, Teams, etc... from a domain and address you specify, and they are sent from your actual Exchange Online instance.
 This will mean it's an internal email and any External tagging you might have will not apply, which would also increase visibility on spoofs.
 Haven't yet turned it on since it's still in preview, but looks promising!

 I AM the mail admin. Changing my config would mean more spam, and less security. Can I tell management to tell the customer to go fuck themselves if they won't even talk to me?
 EDIT:
 Their 'senior infrastructure engineer' called me, and in chronological order: 
  
Ignored the diagnostic information I provided them
 
Blamed me for the problem
 
Told me to change my mail server config to accept their broken DNS (lol nope)
 
Told me to whitelist his domain (Why the fuck would I fake their DNS records on our server?)
 
When I sent the RFC Section & paragraph number...
 
Told me they're in the midst of a migration
 
Told me that they wouldn't fix it for months, if ever
 
Said they'd solve the problem by giving our employees their own eMail addresses on their mail server for 'ease of communication'.
 
 My manager gave me the ok to tell them to go fuck themselves. One less problem in my world.

 Despite testing the system on three separate networks, the problem remains. It also affects all devices, including Yealink, Windows, Android, and iOS, regardless of updating them to the latest Teams version.
 With our call queues operating in conference mode, we have attempted to disable this feature but to no avail. Gamma has conducted a call trace and reported that they were able to hear both sides of the conversation. We would greatly appreciate any assistance in addressing this ongoing issue. 
 It has now been a week since our phone system issues began, and we have yet to receive a concrete update or solution from Microsoft.

 I went all over the interface. We're using the singularity version. I can't find anything on scan settings. It just does scan then says its complete. 
 What am I missing here? I made sure the agent is running as "Local System". That was default I never changed it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This seems like a fairly straightforward problem, unfortunately we're having trouble coming up with a solution that doesn't seem janky.
 Our scenario: US-east coast based company, Windows 10/11 endpoints, we have a small (6 person) satellite office in Korea.
 None of our end users have local admin permissions on their laptops, so periodically they'll need IT assistance to install applications or install drivers (i.e. printers, etc.).
 For folks in timezones that have business hours overlapping with ours, this is a non-issue - we BOMGAR into their laptops, provide the admin credentials, and Bob's your uncle.
 The challenge we're trying to figure out is how to handle this where business hours don't overlap. We can ask end users to leave their computers turned on, which allows us to BOMGAR in unattended, but per best practices, we have a GPO that locks their computer screen after 15 minutes of inactivity, so up 'til now, we've been asking the end user for their password so we can impersonate them. I hate that we do this as it seems janky AF.
 I know we could always sign in as ourselves on their PC and install the software, but unfortunately a lot of the software we've seen is poorly written and has to be installed as the user account that needs to use it.
 The obvious solution is to tell the company that we need to extend our helpdesk operating hours, or we need to have folks on call to handle this type of issue. The first is a non-starter due to $$, and the second is undesirable because who wants to be on call?
 I'm curious if anyone has come up with a better solution for scenarios like this?
 If Windows had some sort of built-in impersonation functionality that could be used to login as an end user (that was properly restricted and audited), that seems like it could be a solution, but I'm not aware of anything like that existing.
 Is this something a 3rd party login manager like Okta, etc. could help us with?

 I need help.
 We currently experience very slow Internet speeds on one of my managed locations.
 According to the ISP it's because we maxed out our Internet bandwidth.
 That would align with my testing.
 Here is the Problem:
 How do I find out which device is using all of the Internet bandwidth all of a sudden.
 Nether the device fleet nor the internet bandwidth changes in the last weeks.
 ​
 I am worried it might be something malicious like a data extraction.
 We are using Unifi switches but I can't see any option in the unifi cloud to monitor device usage of the bandwidth.

Now, I've seen other companies use certs as the authentication method, and obviously I like these more than asking people to write down whatever the 2FA app tells them to, everyday. One thing I don't fully understand (and forgive me for this) is if these certs are the "token" of an actual VPN connection, or if these companies I've seen didn't implement a real VPN solution.
 I'm looking for recommendations based on latest available technologies, good practices, and overall easiness of use.
 We are less than 99 users and everyone has their laptop/VDI administered by an MSP, so whatever tool I decide to use... it should be easy to deploy.
 Thanks!

 The majority of our team members are using macs, some external guests might come in with a windows device.
 Am I nuts to seek for a cheaper yet better solution? This can not be that much of a quest, right?
 Too new of a topic for me, however if airplay wouln't have such a crazy latency i'd rather would suggest that.
 Also we would need to use an external camera + speakers (mic) in our setup.

 Ability to do some chained lookups. We do some complex collections that require correlating between different OIDs.
 Ability to stream data easily to other tools.
  
LibreNMS was one of the tools i tried but it doesn't really tick all 3 boxes.
 Prometheus+Grafana seems very interesting, but i am not sure that point 2 is possible.
 Some licence solutions we found are very expensive but also I don't like feeling "locked" to a vendor.
 Zabbix seems like a very fitting solution. I didn't like the luck of HA solution but there are ways around it.

 But developers do sometimes run queries that last overnight via a local install of ssms on the remote server over RDP. 
 Can anyone think of a couple ways for them to postpose the pending reboot of the servers they are expecting to use overnight but only for a 24 hour period? A desktop icon would be sick that runs a scheduled task that skips the otherwise pending reboot. Bonus points if instead a user can instead exclude themselves from a group policy that logs off idle connections albeit for a 24 hour period.

 We have some production servers and would like to change the backup method from push (the servers currently upload the backups it makes to an SFTP server), to PULL, so we have a remote server, which will run Truenas Core, and will pull the backups of the production server.
 This is usually done with Rsync via SSH, but the cybersecurity team is worried that if the backup server gets compromised, the ssh credentials could be used to open a remote shell in the production server.
 The backup server would be really isolated, only accessible via our corporate VPN and to the production server to grab the backups. But still, if a bad actor could get access to the corporate VPN, somehow get the credentials to the backup server, they could get the SSH keys used to do the rsync job and remote into the production server.
 Is there any way we could prevent this? maybe using other kind of software so we don't have to open SSH access between the production and backup servers?
 The production servers are mainly linux but some windows servers aswall. Is there any way a user could be make in linux so not only the user has access to just the backups, but is not able to execute other commands?

 I'm working on a new backbone, and I'm trying to understand/solve traceroute to internet.
 When packet enter on the backbone, I can see three IP by line...
 Ex:
 1 192.168.92.1 (192.168.92.1) 2.073 ms 2.681 ms 2.677 ms
 2 80.X.X.X (80.X.X.X) 14.157 ms 14.140 ms 12.365 ms
 3 toto (80.X.X.Y) 2.875 ms 3.561 tata (80.X.X.Z) 3.910 ms
 4 IXP (A.A.A.A) 9.806 ms tata (80.X.X.Z) 3.535 ms IXP (A.A.A.A) 8.044 ms 
 It seems like a loop, but I don't know where to start the investigation.
 It's a small backbone with OSPF as IGP. 
 ASBR1 ------- L3 Switch1 ====================== L3 Switch2 --------- ASBR2 
 ASBR1 and ASBR2 send default route via OSPF, so each L3 Switch has 2 default route (one is selected). 
 If you have an idea... 
 Thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got asked by a colleague to present MS Entra to my bosses (small company doing consulting for IAM). I have five minutes and the company works mainly with OIM, so every listener understands IAM way better then I do. I dont like to talk about stuff that I dont understand fairly well, so I am seeking for a bit of help here to not talk rubbish.
 Im fairly new to IAM and only worked with Active Roles so far and a tiny bit on OIM synchronizing CSV-Files to the system. So my knowledge of OIM is pretty limited. Knowledge about Sailpoint is basically non existent. 
 Last year MS launched Entra which includes AAD, a CIEM-Solution, Entra Verified ID and Workload Identities. As far as im aware "MS Entra Identity Governance" is also a new component. 
 I would like to quickly go through the components and then focus on things Entra does way better or way worse than the the other to products.
 I would like to focus on the connection to other systems (especially On-Prem-Systems), since it looks like this could be a weakspot of MS Entra. Is there anything MS Entra (or Azure AD) cant do and why?
 Lifecycle-Management is also a topic I want to focus on. Looks to me like I am pretty limited to what MS offers out of the box. For example if I create a new Workflow for a Leaver I can put in a step, that a mail is sent to the employees manager, but not to the colleagues. 
 Is there anything else MS does greatly or badly on this topic?
 I do greatly appreciate your help girls and guys, since I am really not sure about what to focus on and where the weaknesses of each application are. According to the websites they all can do everything and do everything best.

 I'm just curious as to how you filter routes in Viptela. For example, if I need to find a specific route in the vEdge cli routing table, do I only have the execute using "Include" or adding the correct IP and subnet? 
 Ex. It will take some time to verify whether I got a route if I attempt to to search this IP 10.1.192.1/32.
 vedge1# show ip routes vpn 10 10.1.192.1/32 vedge1# show ip routes vpn 10 | i 10.1.192. | nomore vedge1# show ip routes vpn 10 10.1.192.1 show ip best-match-route vpn 1 ipv4 10.1.192.1 * --------------------------------------------^ syntax error: unknown argument Error executing command: CLI command error - 
 It occasionally fails too by not adding the subnet or incorrect subnet. 
 What other option do I have to determine the route that a host or IP belongs to in viptela?
 ​
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to deploy a Windows 11 In Place Upgrade with our software deployment tool. The prep is already done, ISO extracted, batch file with all the params created. 
 When I manually execute the batch file that basically says 
 setup.exe /auto upgrade /DynamicUpdate disable /showoobe none /Telemetry disable
 it asks me for admin credentials and after entering them with 2 clicks it just does the upgrade. When I'm logged in as an admin it just shows the user access control window with Yes / No and does it. But that credential request shouldn't come up for regular users, obviously. 
 When I execute this batch file from the deployment service however it just doesn't do anything. The deployment script runs forever and never logs what went wrong. Doesn't matter if I use a silent parameter or not. 
 My guess is that the problem is in the context in which the file gets executed. And I have tried all the contexts I could think of. I assume I'm missing a vital part in the logic chain here that prevents me from seeing the solution. 
 Further info: The setup.exe and files are hosted on a file share that can be read-accessed by anyone. The batch file is on the deployment repository and gets downloaded to the client PC when executing. 
 And I've had a similar issue with a different software deployment tool already when I wanted to put a simple shortcut on the desktop of users on a PC as an admin. It feels like that was a similar context issue back then.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning everyone.
 I hope I am not too annoying with my questions lately.
 I am having some problems with Azure Information Protection and the valid applications.
 From what I am reading, it seems to work together with data classification and data loss prevention.
 Which means, if a certain document could contain PII, It can detect this and recommend or apply a sensitivity label on that document, making sure whenever it might leave the company, that the data will be unusable for everyone outside of the company.
 It's a defense mechanism, which extrudes outwards, into the public world.
 I've seen examples, where they only use 3-5 Labels with encryption and/or watermarking. This makes total sense to me, as I have worked with PII before.
 My boss now heard this and thinks, that this will solve all of our problems.
 He told me to create 5 sensitivity labels, for each personnel group of our company. From the CEO to the normal employee. Everyone should get access to documents with a certain sensitivty label, but not others.
 From what he described, he wants a protection, which goes inwards. His example shows, that the he is very wary about his employees.
 No watermarking or data classification. Just encrypt everything and make sure, that no normal employee has access to sensitive documents from his team lead or above.
 This feels wrong to me. I haven't found any example, where Information Protection was used like this. And with that I have a thousand questions and possible outcomes in my mind, because I feel like that it won't stay at 5 labels. In the end I might have to create a label for every project.
 I've seen the quote, that Information Protection are permissions, which move with the documents. But I feel like that my example is a bit "extreme".
 Has anybody used this before like this? Is this a valid use for Information Protection or is there another solution?

 But I've misplaced it. Can't justify dropping $450 to replace it right now. 
 Looking for a software for a windows laptop that can perform some of those same features when testing a single ethernet drop. 
 Honestly, the Link Sprinter has spoiled me, especially with the switch port ID when troubleshooting offline APs. No power? Cool switch port may have lost POE function. As long as I have solid link to a switch, I can ID which switch port the AP drop is on without toning/tracing. Saves multiple trips back/forth to IDF. 
 Any pointers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are a company of almost 50. We have had 15+ employee's personal cell phones contacted by a spam number claiming to be the CEO in 1 hour. One employee's parent was even contacted & they can't think of any place they have their parents' number (not as an emg contact, beneficiary l, life insurance etc... I first, immediately thought of a breach with Paychex or Bamboo or even LinkedIn, but I'm not sure... especially because the employee is sure her family member's number isn't listed anywhere. The fact that the employee's parent got a text is really throwing a wrench in this. We've had employees get texts from our "ceo" asking for gift cards, but this isn't that. I'm inclined to think... find where the family member's number is listed & find the possible link, but idk... nothing is standing out. The employee said she doesn't have her family member's number listed on anything work related. This is so scary. Any ideas? Our anti-virus isn't picking anything up. Our server & emails are fine I'm perplexed with the personal cell numbers. Help!

 I’ve been in my current role as an IT Technician for the last two years. Although my title doesn’t match what I actually do. My experience in IT is mostly call center and level 1 and 2 troubleshooting but with my current role I’ve been working more with networking and server issues. 
 I want to learn more about how our servers work, how the networking switches are configured and everything else I can learn. The issue is that I don’t know how to figure it all out and my boss doesn’t want to teach me unless it’s relevant at the time. The problem is I’m two years in and I don’t feel like I know enough. Also my boss doesn’t make himself available so when there’s problems I’m left scrambling for answers. 
 Any advice? 
 TLDR: want to learn as much as I can about our IT infrastructure but boss will not help.

 Many on the IT team seem excited to have these at their home, but my main question is doesn't all my internet traffic on my router then go through the company's firewall? This would be a stand alone device that hooks into my router, but that seems super sketchy to have a company device like that always monitoring my network traffic.

 I found two seemingly good deals: - HPE 5800AF-48G for around 300 $ - HPE 5130-48G-4SFP+ for around 250 $
 Both have enough 10g SFP+ which are important to me. The amount of ports are overkill for my scenario but I could not find a good L3 10g switch for less honestly. 
 I only need 8 ports in the distribution layer switch. NAS(10g), NVR, Internet Router(1g), 6 x access switches (Wifi AP, IPCAM, etc.)
 What would you recommend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long story short, got a call from a new client who has their internet drop out every 2 hours at the top of the hour.
 More Detail:
 Client has a 100Mb circuit, and for the past few weeks, their connection dies every 2 hours at the top of the hour for a couple minutes, then comes back up. Pings during those outages show connection to their sonicwall, gets to the gateway, and then dies out from there. At&t tech says that their connection is just getting over saturated with standard traffic, ran a pcap from their end, and no signs of DDos or anything irregular.
 I ran wireshark from a client machine and saw nothing out of the ordinary other than packets trying to resend during the outages, sonicwall logs show nothing, and during one of the windows when it always dies, I unplugged their network from the at&t circuit, plugged directly into it, and had no issues during that window. Next step is to setup a netflow monitor to PRTG and see what that shows, but just figured I'd bounce the issue on here to get any suggestions. Gut feeling (for whatever that's worth) is that it's an issue on the circuit that I'll have to convince the isp about. According to the client, nothing has changed inside the network before this started, and the 5 minute windows every 2 hours make it a challenge to test theories and chasing down rabbit holes.

 When watching different YouTube videos of people setting up their edgerouter x, they further tailored this router through its terminal to be more efficient with their use case. Honesty looked like black magic gibberish…
 I’m wondering if anybody has suggestions to make my network more efficient and dependable. Only thing I did outside of a standard/quick setup was hide my network name on the AP.
 Any suggestions and learning material are appreciated. Currently waiting for “introduction to show networking” by John Huntington.

 Is there some way to guesstimate the amount of data use per person, like caterers do? (For example, they plan on 1/3 lb. of beef per person for tacos. 100 people, do the math, add 10%.) 
 If we go over cap, we get dropped to 10mbps, so that won't do. 
 I have indeed tried to research this, but everything comes up with data info for Zoom meetings, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today i gave control over the entire IT to an MSP, because im leaving the company and there‘s no one left, which could take over my tasks. I was a single sysadmin/tech at that company. So my boss choose an MSP and today i did gave him my documentation and a training session. Job done. 
 However, what i saw truly blew my mind. Here are a few things, which made me believe i‘m in the wrong movie.
 1) Gave him access to one 1Password Vault. He didn‘t know what it is (fine, not everyone can know everything) and he said how insecure this is. I asked him, why he came to this conclusion when he didn‘t read the whitepaper and what tool he would choose. Answer: My laptop uses bitlocker, that‘s why i store everything in excel. I asked him what he would do if his devices getting compromised? As long as his device is powered on bitlocker doesn‘t help. Well, if i get compromised it‘s over anyway, a password manager wouldn‘t help. 
 2) he doesn‘t deactivate or remove the local admin account, because he‘s the only one who knows the password anyway.
 3) he couldn‘t tell the difference between MB and GB/TB.
 4) he has no clue about linux and has no employee who does and still manages linux machines.
 I needed to vent, cause i always was thinking i‘m still not good enough for a sole sysadmin role to get a job at another company (i did, but struggled long time to do this step) and did know more than a MSP boss with 100s of clients…

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am currently studying NETCONF and YANG data modeling, and so far, I am somewhat understanding creating filters to pull data. I can formulate a filter to request a container within the model, but I cannot figure out how to pull ALL containers at once, aka pulling the entire model's worth of data.
 Can someone please assist me in understanding how to do this? For reference, I am using ncclient and the YANG model I am using is ietf-interfaces.yang.
 Thank you.
 Edit: To clarify, I know that in the XML filter, you can call all the containers in one go. However, assuming a YANG model with too many damn containers, I'd like to find a way to call them all at once in one short, simple filter.

But it has a ground on the cable and I'm not sure what to do with it, I got a can of shielded cat6a ends from Amazon and I know it's the wrong kind because it's really hard to push the wire through and it dosent crimp well, what ends am I suppose to use? What am I supposed to do with the ground? It's obviously supposed to terminate onto the connectors but there's really no spot on them to do so, TIA

 The Federal Aviation Administration has issued a nationwide ground stop for Southwest Airlines flights, citing “equipment issues.”
 “Southwest Airlines requested the FAA pause the airline’s departures,” the agency told CNN in a statement.
 Southwest Airlines reported technology issues Tuesday morning and said it would “hopefully be resuming our operation as soon as possible.” c
 The flight tracking website FlightAware said nearly 800 of the airline’s flights – about 14 percent of its schedule – were delayed Tuesday, far ahead of any US carrier.
 Southwest called the problem “intermittent technology issues” in a social media post to customers. Several have taken to social media to complain about delayed flights
 “We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but we’re hoping to get everyone going ASAP,” the airline wrote in another social media post.
 CNN has reached out to Southwest and the Federal Aviation Administration for further comment.

 There are two other people on my team who I really like and I feel I’ve stepped up into a leadership role for them pretty well. 
 The problem is I don’t stop worrying about crashes, incidents and meltdowns any time I’m not online. 
 It came to a head this week when I canceled a vacation to Morocco because I didn’t want to risk being offline. 
 I’m guessing this promotion was a mistake? Any way to salvage this?

Deployed them all to %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Signatures... all good. Then last night during patch Tuesday, Microsoft implements new roaming signatures and such, completely changing the look and feel of the signature settings (so our screenshot documented instructions are no longer valid), but most everyone's signature is moved to "Signatures on this Device", not "Personal Signatures", and as Signatures on this Device, cannot be set as the default signature to apply to new messages! Not only that, but there's not a simple copy button to move it to Personal Signatures. (yes, you can copy and paste the text, go to Personal and hit New, give it a name and paste in the designer box, but we're talking about elderly employees that it took 5 pages of instructions to just to implement the signatures in the first place.

Both degrees look great from my perspective so sorry for my ignorance.
 Computer Science was my 1st choice but I would have to take a term break to take Calculus and re-enter and I don't see that being the play at this point, maybe a masters later, who knows.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Almost a month ago I was laid off, and without work for the first time in 15 years. I got depressed and it seemed like no one was hiring. I submitted over 200 applications and resumes and that first week or two all I got were rejection letters. I worked on my resume and cover letter and finally had 6 interviews last week. I ended up with 2 job offers so far, but what really got me was the way the manager of one of the companies went about it. He went back to his boss and asked for 15% more than the top end of the posted salary range because "We need this guy, and we need to be competitive in the market to get him" (his exact words). I ended up taking a ~20% pay cut from where I was before the layoff, but I think I found a place that wants me. 
 It was really nice to feel like the pretty girl at the dance for once. Keep it up, there is a job out there that really wants every one of us, I was just lucky to find one when I needed it the most.

 I get an auto renewal reminder email this AM saying my domain is set to auto renew in May for $1200 USD for the year!
 I opened up a support chat with NameCheap and they indicate the registry for .help now considers my domain to be classified as premium. 
 Wtf is this? There was no warning or indication of a price increase, a literal arbitrary cost increase based on an existing registered domain, and classifying it as premium after the fact is flat out extortion. 
 I’m considering transferring the domain away from NameCheap to another registrar. I’m looking for advice to see if anyone knows of any .help registrars that offer a free or low cost transfer option, and hopefully a reasonable renewal rate. 
 I see hover has .help support but their renewal rate is approx $1000 after the first year. I don’t know what PorkBun offers. Neither of these places I have an account for. 
 Has this happened to you before?
 Would it be worth bringing this up to ICANN?
 Would love to know your thoughts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen hundreds of posts over the years from computer techs who absolutely cringe at the idea of working on home computers, and I'm curious why.
 I work on home and small business computers. In a medium metro area I bill $140 for a home visit up to 1.5 hours, then $80/hour. Since many calls end up being "install a printer," or "get rid of my pop-ups" some of those calls end up taking 20-45 minutes, and I can sometimes finish 5-7 calls in a 8 hour day.
 Have additional problems? Book an additional appointment. 
 I've been doing this for about 19 years with VERY few major issues, and I find the stress to be incredibly low in my residential work.
 When it comes to income, if I maintain just 4 residential appointments each day for 45 weeks a year, income would be $126,000, again, with minimal stress (although admittedly more car wear & tear).
 When you are competing with the big box stores, you really don't have competition. 
 Why the hate on residential?

 What are some things I could pivot to? TAC seems like the logical answer, but I'm not sure how the pay would stack up. Network-related product testing/QA was another that caught my eye, but few of those don't require a software background. Any outside-the-box stuff I could look at?

 It lets you use a PowerShell command to set the membertimetolive attribute when you add a member to a group so the accounts automatically lose access to the group after a set length of time.
 Is this really useful? It seems impractical because I don’t see any parameter you can set to schedule a future start time. For instance giving a user membership to a group during a future change window.
 You would need to use a scheduled task running as an account with privileges to add users to groups and scheduling it to run the command at the future date and time. If you are messing with scheduled tasks anyway, you can do almost the same thing already without activating this optional feature. Just run two tasks. One to add the membership and another to remove the membership,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good day!
 May I ask for some help and recommendations, to setup Windows Defender? Especially for Mail attachments.
 Some Background. Currently we are switching from Forti Endpoint Security to Windows Defender for Business.
 I've checked all common options in Intune and checked out the windows defender playground and demo files. Everything gets detected from my tests.
 Regarding Internet Security I feel somewhat safe now.
 Though, I have problems in detecting email attachment. Several times per week I receive notifications from my forti ems server, about newly found malware in mail attachments. We receive a high amount of fake invoices, voice messages or other stuff, hidden in html files. Typical javascript stuff, phishing. 
 For me this is obvious. Invoices shoulnd't arrive in html format.
 And yet, people who are already using the windows defender ask me regularly "Is this spam?"
 Stuff like "Customer Invoice LIQUIDATION CENTER LTD.html" faking a identical clone of the microsoft authentication. Forti was able to detect these kinds of attacks, but not the defender.
 We have also setup a Office 365 Anti-Phishing Policy. But I feel like it's not working as it should, or it only applies to mails, but doesn't apply on attachments?
 What am I doing wrong? Why isn't stuff like this getting detected?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I want to preface this by saying that even though I use the word "we" extensively, I have only been employed here about 2 weeks. Our IT department is me and my boss. My position was newly created. So 'we', really means 'boss'.
 Also, links to a place where I can read more about this subject is appreciated.
 ​
 We run about a 100 android tablets through MaaS360 and android enterprise. When we first started doing this, we used a single gmail account to set up all the devices. However when we got to about 30 devices or so, it started dropping devices. So we created a second account. Same problem, but it was around 20 devices this time. So on so forth, now we have several gmail accounts managing our devices. I cannot find anything online that indicates a limit. MaaS360 doesn't have a limit in our range I know. 
 Now I did see that there is a limit to 10 devices per user in MaaS360. One possibility is that we would set up devices for different users, but my supervisor would set up test devices under her name. This would then cause registration issues for subsequent devices. This only sort of makes sense though, because I can't see her setting up 10+ devices for herself. I also think it was dropping other users devices, not her devices. 
 I feel the need to include timeframe here as well, in case things changed. We started this process about 5 or 6 years ago and slowly ran into issues. 
 ​
 Anything you can help me with this is welcome. Thanks!

 I think that there is a security issue here, since Administrator credentials will be cached on workstations.
 I wondering if the same risk will happens if that admin uses RDP to access machines remotely? 
 If a workstation is suddenly rebooted, cached credentials will be gone, correct, or will they still be there?
 Thank you for your suggestions

 My environment leverages Group Policy to install the LAPSx64.msi (I'm assuming this installer encompasses the client-side extensions mentioned in the article above). We have a number of OSs that miss the coverage window on the new Windows LAPS coverage, and so we will continue using the legacy LAPS solution for the time being. 
 Can someone check my logic?:
  
Installing the 04/2023 MS Updates on devices that currently have legacy LAPS installed will continue to operate normally.
 New devices that receive the 04/2023 MS Updates (baked into an image, installed via task sequence on deployment, etc.) and THEN receive the LAPS CSE msi will then break
 THEREFORE: As long as LAPS CSE is installed before 04/2023 update, legacy-mode LAPS should work fine. (?)

 Hey on a side note, if anyone is thinking about using LastPass for idp/SSO and MFA, my recommendation is fuck no.

 Its driving me crazy!
 Cannot seem to find anything in google that has been helpful.
 The fingerprint sensor is constantly trying to scan for a fingerprint when nothing is touching it.
 The impact of this is it keeps the windows lock screen active and monitors never turn off etc.
 Just keeps flashing your device is having trouble recognizing you, please try again, constantly.
 ​
 If you touch it, it logs in correctly.
 Device:Asus ROG Flow X13 GV301QE
 Fingerprint device: ELAN WBF Fingerprint sensor - asus driver version is 3.5.12201.11202
 Windows 11 with latest updates
 Troubleshooting: 
 Tried newer drivers, older drivers, specifically listed driver from Asus, no difference.
 Many restarts.
 Nothing specific I can find in event viewer
 ​
 For now I have deleted my fingerprint so its not happening and monitors will turn off etc.

 Running the repadmin /replsummary show command generates an error of 'repadmin can't connect to a home server. Error: An LDAP lookup operation failed with the following error: LDAP Error 81<0x51>: Server down'. 
 Running the repadmin /replsum command shows the following:

 error: <2148074274> The target principal name is incorrect 
 Finally, running the repadmin /showrepl command shows error KCC could not add this REPLICA LINK due to error. 
 The DCs at the site don't hold any FSMO roles so that should things a bit easier. For the replica link issue, I've come across a potential fix that says to delete then recreate the account. For the other issues I'm not sure what the best approach to take is.
 For the target principal name error, will this fix likely work? https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/identity/replication-error-2146893022
 Is it better just to create 2 new DCs for the site?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm reaching out for some advice, input, or just a general plan on how to deal with a challenging situation I'm currently facing at work. I work in a company where I am responsible for procuring everything but laptops (phones, chargers, monitors, docking stations, printer maintenance services, VESA mounts, laptop bags, headsets, mice, and keyboards).
 To make things even more complicated, I have to categorize each item properly in SAP so management approves these purchases, attaching the 'price offer' which is often just a screenshot of a price on a website. After that, I have to 'goods movement' them into SAP, attaching the invoice or proof of work.
 This process is causing me a lot of trouble since finance is constantly telling me that the material group, G/L account, or cost center is incorrect, which forces me to recategorize or start the process over. Unfortunately, my colleague already quit due to the frustration, and my boss has not delivered on promised changes to the process. As a result, I'm left alone to handle this mess together with all the IT work.
 This situation is taking up hours of my time daily, and I'm struggling to find a solution. My boss insists that we have to perform these activities and prioritize them, likely because his IT Director reports directly under a Finance director. Procurement says we have to open the Purchase Requisitions, as they can't transform them into Purchase orders themselves due to conflict of interest and policy concerns (although I doubt the legitimacy of this claim).
 I didn't want to vent, but I'm genuinely seeking advice and input from the r/sysadmin community. If any of you have faced similar issues or have any tips, suggestions, or a plan to tackle this problem, please share your thoughts. I'm eager to find a way to streamline this process or at least make it more manageable.
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 One of our customers using Sharepoint uses Onedrive to sync the libraries to their desktop PC's. Recently we have completely changed the structure of their Sharepoint site, renamed several Libraries and changed A LOT of rights.
 The problem I am now facing, is that users that now lost their permissions to certain libraries or libraries that had their name changed/got removed, will still see the folders on their respective PC's. The folders are no longer synced, but they are still present on the systems including files. Every user may even face this on multiple pc's as they work on multiple systems (flex). As you know, this may differ for every user aswell, because they all have different rights.
 Question is, do you know any way to automatically remove libraries that are no longer synced?
 The systems are managed through Intune and are all Azure AD joined. I haven't been able to solve this braincracker yet and our support desk has been called many many times by customers seeing 'the wrong folders' or people editting files locally, because they are not synced anymore.
 Thanks.

The issue right now is a lot of people are jumping ship due to poor management. As more and more people leave, I find myself taking on more work to keep things stable at the company. I thought this added responsibility would befit a raise to which my boss agreed, but I was offered roughly a dollar more (I’m salary). 
 The other part of this is that I was told that I was on track to becoming a VP , but that position was given to an outside hire whom I had to train. So I’m at a point where I feel like I am going nowhere in the company. 
 I was given a new job opportunity at a more mom & pop IT group. While things are definitely going south at my current company, I can’t help but be nervous that maybe I am jumping the gun. 
 The new employer has promised to match my pay, but I am losing earned PTO and my cell phone bill being paid each month. Should I take the position at the mom and pop place ? Whom offered medical benefits , but at a 50% employer paid rate. Or stay at the company that keeps telling me to stay in my lane every time I try to give help where it’s needed? They have no medical benefits at this time. I’m mostly worried about taking a small financial cut and no PTO to get out of a poorly managed company.

 How do people actually deal with this business risk? This was a single developer writing a single query to create what they thought was a custom metric, that turned out to be a custom metric per unique URL.

 So curious if anyone has any good solutions for organizing a mess of fiber patches, copper patches, various adapters and vendor specific cables, etc. Not really looking for a tool bag for ALL of my crap, just organizing out all the various cables and cable adapters a tech carries in the field. Ideally I'd rather just have all my cabling and various adapters in one location, but I'm not 100% opposed to separating it out to fiber and copper related.

I am trying to give access to the Trusted 1 to the Vlan interface (only some users but for the sake of the question lets says all).
 I created 4 policies TCP/UDP, from trusted to Vlan10, Vlan10 to trusted. and 2 same way for http and https since what is behind Vlan10 are cameras that I need to manage using browser. No matter what I do I do not manage to send or get traffic from or to the Vlan interface. I can ping the cameras from the wathcguard but that is it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hopefully this will save time for others.
 We recently started rolling out Surface Laptop 5 to our staff, replacing old models. Almost immediately staff started complaining about USB devices (keyboard/mouse/whatever) disconnecting at random times or not working at all.
 We spent one month troubleshooting to the point that we stopped any further purchases while working with Microsoft support.
 The issue turns out to be SentinelOne. 
 Scenario:
  
Device with Intel Smart Sound Technology for USB Audio – affects ALL Surface Laptop 5, but not 4 – probably it needs to be a specific hardware.
 S1 with Device Control enabled – it just needs to be enabled, no rules needed – We can reproduce with agent version 22.1 , 22.2 and 22.3
 Users plugs in a USB device that interact with the audio subsystem, directly to the USB port of to a USB hub, connected to the laptop, which would include : webcams, headsets, etc…
 All USB devices connected to the laptop (whether USB hub, USB hub through a dock, or directly), crash and disconnect, sometime the laptop may bluescreen or freeze.
 Uninstalling S1 agent immediately fixes the behaviour
 To workaround the issue and allow S1 agent to be installed, we had to add the following override, in S1 console under settings-policy override
  
​
 {
 "deviceControl": {
 "excludedDeviceSetupClasses": [
 "{4d36e96c-e325-11ce-bfc1-08002be10318}"
 ]
 }
 }
 ​
  
the 4d36 etc is the GUID Class ID of the Intell SST USB interface, you can grab it by right clicking on the device in device manager.
 Change will immediately apply, no restart needed, to all devices in the scope where you configured the policy override.
  
​
 I have passed all these info to S1 support so they hopefully can release new version of the agent.

 We are wanting to operate a popup wifi network for an outdoor event in a field. We have a basic idea of a design hardware wise and want to see if it’s even in the ballpark of where we need to be. We are wanting to keep the design value oriented since this will only be used for specific events. We want to support up to 5000 users with basic mobile phone usage over Wi-Fi. We have a 10gb fiber backhaul. 
 Mikrotik CCR2216 Router x 1
 Mikrotik CRS510 Switch x 1
 EnGenius Cloud ECS5512FP Switch x 2
 EnGenius ECW270 AP x 14 
 Would this cover our needs? We will have a 3rd party captive portal for authentication. This is for high level preliminary budgeting purposes. 
 Thanks!
 Edit:
 Thanks to those with constructive replies. We are definitely hiring a consultant and will have network engineers running the the show. This was a basic post to ask a question for a ballpark budgetary check. Should’ve posted this in the moronic question Monday or whatever it’s called.

 I downloaded the image and pushed it to the device, did an md5 verification and came back good. 
 I also tried issuing the upgrade command to R0 and then RP active with the same result. 
 I guess I can try redownloading the image and trying again but wanted to know if I’m missing something. Seems pretty straightforward though. 
 Not a major issue, just trying to clear a bug relating to power environment logs. I did upgrade to the latest gold star IOS-XE software beforehand. 
 Just looking to see if anyone experienced this.

 If I were MS I would feel embarrassed. It's a virtual certainty that any of the folks on this subreddit know more about their product than their first few levels of support. But since they're the gatekeepers under some circumstances, you're left with no choice but to suffer through days of aimless questions. 
 The language barrier in some cases for me is to the point where I can't even understand what's being asked of me.
 It's just a deeply frustrating experience. For one of the largest corporations in the world, they should be able to do much better on the support side of their business.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been running EVE-NG community edition for labs with cisco ios images for a couple months. I am overall very happy with the lab environment EVE provides. The one issue I have never been able to resolve is pasting in commands into the web browser CLI. It would save me quite a bit of time in my labs if I was able to copy and paste the initial device configurations directly into the web browser CLI (i.e. interface ip's, device name, username/password etc.). I am able to use PuTTY to SSH into my devices from windows but this requires me to set up SSH on each device individually. Hoping someone has a quick solution that would save me time so I can focus on the core lessons of the labs.

Overview and Context
The UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the US National Security Agency (NSA), US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are releasing this joint advisory to provide details of tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) associated with APT28’s exploitation of Cisco routers in 2021.
We assess that APT28 is almost certainly the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) 85th special Service Centre (GTsSS) Military Intelligence Unit 26165. APT28 (also known as Fancy Bear, STRONTIUM, Pawn Storm, the Sednit Gang and Sofacy) is a highly skilled threat actor.

 Our quarantine policy allows for end users to release emails from quarantine, but I was wondering if this is still submitting them for machine learning to improve the system.
 What made me question this was noticing that the end user doesn't have the option to "Report to Microsoft to improve detection" like an admin does when they release an email.
 End users do have the option "Report message as having no threats" but they are still getting multiple quarantines from the same domain and senders.
 Obviously I can whitelist the domains/senders/IPs in Policies and Rules, but this lead me to wonder are the end user releases actually sending data to machine learning?

 We've inherited an environment with a PowerVault MD3800i. We installed a few new drives in it (model MG03SCA400) that are listed in Dell's Support Matrix
 Using MDSM, the drives are seen but theirStatus and Mode are both listed as "Incompatible".
 My first instinct is that this is because they're on firmware version 0108 while DG09 is what is supported.
 The trouble is, I can't get the new firmware onto them! I go to Upgrade>Physical Disk Firmware, and choose the file, which MDSM does say that it's compatible with them. 
 Then I try to load it onto these drives it returns Error 249 - failed because they are bypassed/offline. (Incidentally I tried this in Online/All/Parallel modes)
 So unless I'm missing something it looks like a catch-22; I can't upload the firmware because the firmware is out of date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I got approached by someone who wants me to come work for them. The pay is going to be more, the estate is probably 10x’s bigger than my current place, and it’s a spin off from a huge company. So it’s sorta like a startup in the way that the tech is all shiney and new. No legacy stuff at all. 
 I love my current job. We are also shiney and new and since we are way smaller, I’m well known by everyone, even the C-Suite. They know the names of my wife and kids and always ask about them when they see me. I’m also respected and one of the leaders others seek out. 
 The team is siloed into 5 parts at the new place and I will be leading one of the silos but will take part in the other areas. Today, I do all 5 parts and do them well. So I’ll be less focused on those other areas. Also my work load is insanely easy at my current place. I can work 60 hours one week and maybe 40 minutes other weeks. I can come and go as I please at my current place, my boss doesn’t care what I do. The people at my current place are also some of the smartest people I’ve got to work with. And I have known and worked with these people (holy shit this just occurred to me when I did the math) for MORE THAN HALF MY LIFE! 
 I’m really torn here. Any thoughts from people who have been in this situation?
 Edit: A couple of the posts here answered the question. This post could tend to get a lot of responses so I’m going to stick with the current gig. I’ve been here since I was a teenager (buy outs, ipos, spin-offs). I haven’t had a real interview in 25 years so I’m going to get to the end of the interview process at this new place and kindly decline. I don’t want to burn bridges.

 When i disable NAT, i dont get the public IP on my firewall via DHCP, manually doesnt work neighter. Using PPPOE/DialUp and all that doesnt make sense neighter, because the router shows that he is already connected and has a public IP Adress, even when i disable NAT, so why should the firewall dial in when the router already did that
 So where is my error in my brain or in my configuration
 I just want my firewalls to get my only public ip adress so i can block certain countries for hosting

 I recently picked up a pair of used managed switches (TP-Link T1600G-28PS) for 1/4 the price of new ones. We have all TP-Link managed switches, so I'm planning ahead now.
 So, I go to test them; it boots up just fine and loads the web UI. Just like I'm used to, except this one is super quiet. Then I realize...the fans are off. Not low, they're O-F-F. Is that normal and to be expected? Did I just not notice the others doing this in the din of our "MDF"?
 I've seen a few machines running with no fans: I have an EdgeRouter (fan-less) at home and an arsenal of Raspberry Pis. But I've never seen this level of equipment running with no fans.
 So, should I be concerned? Does they need to be repaired or replaced? I'm not in tune with the thermodynamics (heat management) of network equipment. Please advise.
 FWIW, if I put these in production, they could potentially be feeding power to a few SIP phones and IP cameras (max 5W for both devices).

 Lately, more and more I am seeing domain joined hosts that just will not sync their time from a domain controller for love nor money.

 I have tried multiple guides online and usually what I end up doing is giving up and setting an NTP server on the workstation side which is not ideal 
 Does anyone have any sort of SOP for doing this, or any advice on best practice?
 Thanks

All the research I've done points to having to split the IP into four columns, sorting them, and recombining them as the only way to get Excel to realize that 20 comes before 100. This would work fine for a static document but for a living one, it quickly becomes a problem.
 Does anyone have a tip or trick to get it to sort IPs correctly without resorting to the process described above or use a program they can recommend that is similar to Excel but knows how to sort them correctly?
 Edit: Thank you for all of the input. I think I need to research some IPAMs now to see if any of those will work for what I'm needing to do.

This router will only handle North and South traffic as an aggregation of multiple service providers. Below is the one that I had found and though could be a good idea but let me know!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been getting interviews, with startups, mid size corporations and even Amazon. Some of these manage to go past the initial phone screen and to the hiring manager. I even had one where I talked to an executive. 
 What am I doing wrong? Is it due to the market? I admit that I know Azure, AD, Office 365 and have used Windows server but don’t have advanced knowledge, especially of server backups. I have 2 years of work experience, a Business IT Management degree and am studying for Network plus.
 How can I conduct myself in interviews better? I do dress up in an office shirt with a tie.

I found that it's buggy sometimes. E.g sometimes if i have subinterfaces configured i get no arp entries or unable to ping across the network.I have to reboot the nodes and they might work. If i use the bare interfaces they work fine. I tried the same images in eve but it seems to be the same. Anyone with a working alternative or any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This past week I've suddenly had 5 laptops flagged for hard drive usage exceeding 95%. Turns out it was the same issue for every one. Something was up with the Windows System Protection and Restore settings. The disk space usage was set to 100% which in turn filled up the entire drive. 
 Solution: Run > sysdm.cpl > System Protection tab > Configure button > Delete all restore points and move the slider down to something lower (I've been choosing 10%). No restart required, but not a bad idea to do one. 
 I'm not sure what's causing it. Just thought I would post something in case others ran into it :)
 EDIT - /u/SauceAdmin noted this potentially being a Dell issue specifically with the SupportAssist app: https://old.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/12pi2im/suddenly_workstations_have_95_full_hard_drives/jgmjgg7/

 How you handle with Accounts in Windows Devices to remote workers? The device is sent with a local Admin account and a Work account (to the user)? Or only Work account?
 Which one may be the best approach?
 We'll use Intune (AAD Joined) with Microsoft 365 accounts (Work Account) to the remote users. 
 The computer will be sent by a service provider, so I'll not have access to configure it by myself before received by the employee.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We were a bit late to the show on enabling proper DKIM and DMARC policies in our environment, but finally implemented it in our O365 tenant. 
 As a result, some vendors that send emails on our behalf (using our domain) have been routing to junk/spam as expected. We have resolved issues with vendors that support DKIM signing and DMARC, however some vendors just flat out don't support it. Before DKIM and DMARC we were able to allow these emails through just with basic mail flow rules.
 Service Fusion for example is a vendor that doesn't seem to support it (https://dmarc.io/source/service-fusion/). How do you deal with these particular vendors? I have suggested to my service manager to use the default domain (as opposed to using our domain), however he's wondering why we can't leave it the way it's always been.
 From his perspective, our "enhancements" to our email security are a step backwards for him and his department. He's requesting us to revert our changes (which we're not interested in doing). It seems to me like the obvious way to proceed is to use the out of the box domain instead of trying to spoof our domain without proper DKIM and DMARC, but I was just interested what the community's opinion is on this?

 Tenable
 Ivanti
 Automox (just for patching)

 For some reason, in this case this hasn't happened. There's no entry put into AD's DNS server for these systems.
 If I go on to one of them and try to ping the others, it works, but using an ipv6 address.
 If I disable ipv6 then try ping again, it works, but it says the target system name is '<hostname>.local'
 This was a standard deployment of server 2022 using MDT and in Feb I deployed machines the same way and they worked fine.

Windows Update for Business policies are very generic and not a WSUS replacement.
 What I mean by comparable control and visibility to WSUS is:
  
For every update, you can see which computers have installed, not installed, failed install, or are pending reboot to install it.
 You can make groups out of computers to report on and control
 Each update is explicitly approved by you (or a script/criteria you built) for each group, and under no circumstances can Microsoft push anything to clients without your permission.
 Drivers can be included if you're willing to deal with them on this level, or excluded and done automatically.
  
I don't like having to choose between control and visibility and the risk of remote users who don't use the VPN enough being outdated, or them just not being managed at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I’ve got Azure AD Connect setup and running ok. It syncs our local user accounts to cloud.
 I now want to start using O365 for pwd reset and need Azure AD Connect to sync the passwords from cloud to premises. 
 Azure AD app has Password hash synchronisation and Password writeback enabled.
 I’ve tried to reset a test account’s password but the password is not syncing back to premises. I can use the new password in O365, but can’t login to PC unless using old pwd.
 Synchronisation Service Manager shows latest sync and I can see the results user properties, and lastPasswordChange is howling as none.
 Any ideas on where to look?
 Many thanks in advance

 For the life of me I can't figure out why it fails to cast to smart tv's in the office and a Microsoft adapter, I know it uses the same technology. WIFI.
 This is what i've found out.
 - Casting to smart TV's on laptops that are not domain joined and not on the wifi *WORK*
 - Trying to cast from domain joined laptops fails or buffers endlessly
 - Disconnecting from the company domain WIFI also fails from a domain joined laptop.
 ​
 So it seems the issue isn't down to the network configuration but down to a laptop being domain joined.
 Does anyone else have any idea what to look at/check/do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I've come for your help once again /r/sysadmin 
 In preparation of migrating to Win11, and also because of general security, I am in the midst of moving our 802.1x authentication from PEAP to EAP-TLS. I am stuck on an issue that I can't seem to figure out despite reading documentation, watching tutorials etc. 
 I have a Computer group that i'll call EAPTLS-group and a computer that I'll call Computer1, that is a member of EAPTLS-group. I have set up NPS policys for ethernet, using smartcard of other certificate and enrolled the certificate used so that it is visible on Computer1. Being a member of EAPTLS-group is a requirement. The CA is the same as the NPS server. 
 GPO is set to:
 Autoenroll certificate and renew certs based on templates
 "SmartCard or other certificate" network auth method
 "Computer Only" auth mode
 Selected certificate issuer as well as trusted root CA's
 defined what server to connect to for NPS
 ​
 GPO is applied to:
 OU that Computer1 is placed in
 Authenticated users (also tried security filtering EAPTLS-group but that made no difference)
 ​
 To the issue:
 When trying to connect the NPS security logs say that for Computer1: "The Network Access Permission setting in the dial-in properties of the user account in Active Directory is set to Deny access to the user. To change the Network Access Permission setting to either Allow access or Control access through NPS Network Policy, obtain the properties of the user account in Active Directory Users and Computers, click the Dial-in tab, and change Network Access Permission" 
 This is not true, as it is set to Control access through NPS 
 Any ideas as to what might be happening? My apologies if I'm being unclear, I'm happy to specify 
 Thank you!

My feet can't hold me and I feel the pressure in the nerves of the metatarsal area. It's so painful and is causing foot deformation. Besides I had episodes of very painful legs, and blue veins (not swollen) I could see through the skin of my legs. I tried compression socks and they work wonders, but I can never go back to be default settings, a.k.a healthy legs. Am I experiencing early symptoms of deep vein thrombosis/blood clotting?

 My question is, is it a default behaviour that bitlocker is not suspended for Windows patch installation and reboot?

 I'm struggling to find a concise answer from google so thought I would ask here.
 Is RSTP Switch brand dependent? I have an SMB site where we want to swap out the switches currently running most of their network for new Zyxel Models w/PoE which seem to work well for us and have easy and quick config changes via mobile app - I am then looking to move the existing switches D-Link's over to their server cabinet for use here and wanted to use RSTP so if i lose a link between any of the switches in the loop it would be able to get round the other way. 
 I've had this running fine on a single brand of switches but is it possible between different switch brands? I'm looking to keep the older switches to save on costs
 Thanks

 We had App Password disabled in MFA Service Settings.
 We haven't touched anything in 365 so trying to work out if something is broken or if Microsoft have changed something as I see nothing in the notification centre.

 ​
 Got an Outlook issue that I cannot solve, so thought I'd put it to the hive mind.
 We are running Windows 10/11. Server 2019/2022, Office 365 and unfortunately Roaming Profiles (I know, I know, but this isn't changing anytime soon)
 We have a .vbs file that get user info from AD (On Prem) and runs via a logon script in GP to add a group of signatures to Outlook (It contains 4 different signatures as our company has 4 different entities)
 When we logon with a new user, this .vbs script does it's thing as it should but it tries to open Outlook 2016 (Note we are using 365) and tries to connect to an Exchange server which we no longer have, to be able to load the users emails.
 Everytime, I have to cancel this process, the run the actual Outlook (365) to get the user into their emails
 Anyone got any idea how I can stop this happening? I have set up a new user on AD using folder redirection rather than a Roaming Profile and it loads normally, I just have to logoff and back on to be able to view the signatures in Outlook 365
 ​
 If anyone could shed any light it would be appreciated.

 So I’m looking for options for a gateway solution and what I gather is that rspamd seems to be great. But is there a portal/product that it can be interfaced with so users can review, block and allow?
 Another big downer for PMG is that it’s not at all mobile friendly, something essential in this day and age.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 So I got an email from Microsoft recently. Subject "Migrate to the Authentication methods policy in Azure Active Directory by 30 September 2024".
 And I wanted to try following the instructions and try it in a small tenant of around 10 people, that I very sporadically give support to, before doing the same on other tenants.
 MFA and SSPR were already setup before. No Conditional Access available (only using M365 Business Standard).
 The instructions on this page are pretty good and easy to follow. Essentially, I enabled and configured the methods that were being used before in either MFA or SSPR.
 I do have a doubt though. At the end of article, it says:
  
Finish the migration 
 After you update the Authentication methods policy, go through the legacy MFA, and SSPR policies and remove each authentication method one-by-one. Test and validate the changes for each method.
  
So I followed through and cleared all the methods and saved successfully.
  
MFA service settings - screenshots: BEFORE / AFTER
 Password reset | Authentication methods - screenshots: BEFORE / AFTER
  
​
 My question is:
 In the new policy (screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/kV4xITt.png ), where is it being defined which methods are available to users willing to self reset their password ? This was very easy to understand in the previous "Password reset | Authentication methods" page but now I'm a little bit confused.
 ​
 Edit: cleared text, added new screenshots.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been in IT for almost 20 years now since leaving university and looking for my next role and relaised I have a huge lack of professional qualifications which is hampering my search. Currently I run the IT systems years for a small finance company in London (35 people), and I've been there over 6 years now. While I like the variety, challenge and autonomy, things like professional development and training haven't been forthcoming which has left me with no recent professional qualifications.
 My CV currently only lists ITIL Foundation v3 as a professional certification, which is now woefully out of date, but I feel like at least ITIL hasn't changed that much. I have however, made the choice to omit all of MS certifcations from 10 years ago as it really doesn't look great to have things like Server 2008 and SQL 2012 listed given how dated they are now.
 So my question is this, given that my free time is limited like most people, which are the best certifications to get which are fairly short 1-2 day courses and fairly cheap, while also providing good prospects for future roles, and a good line to have on my CV and LinkedIn. Ideally in the realms of cyber security, change management and the Azure Cloud.
 My initial thoughts are
 Cyber Essentials
 ISO 27001
 MS Partner courses in the more advanced areas of Azure Load balancing and cloud server migration.
 Maybe looking into upgrading to ITIL v4
 Change management courses
 ​
 I would love some feedback and suggestions, thanks!

 Most of the pc's are used as Cash registers. 
 My plan was to do the following:
  
TeamViewer on all computers for easy support
 TeamViewer Monitor to secure pc's are up to date and secure
 SpiceWorks agent for Inventory
 Create Admin account on all pc's and create a user account for the users
  
How would you all handle this?

 It's essentially controlling items in other people's calendars which I don't think is possible. Ttelling everyone to just hit the Holiday button in Options doesn't cut it. I've tried creating and sending an all day event to my test calendar but it doesn't prevent the recipient from hitting the Decline button. It's also nothing short of cumbersome.
 I don't think there is a practical solution, but there might be other methods I haven't thought of. So... open to ideas if anyone has attempted this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hope all are well,
 ​
 I'll start by explaining the dilemma I'm currently facing;
 I have a client who has slightly under 1 million folders/files in a single SharePoint site.
 They have had syncing issues for a fair bit of time now. Syncing from the explorer to the cloud
 can take anywhere from 5minutes-1 hour (sometimes many more or not at all).
 ​
 I have tested with a brand new SharePoint site with instant syncing (just to confirm it has nothing to do with the environment).
 ​
 Anyway, so my question is how common is 1 single SharePoint site for the entire business? How many files is technically "too many" regardless of what MS claims it can handle.
 I'm planning on rebuilding the SharePoint structure into individual sites per folder below;
 Jobs
 Quotes
 Projects
 Accounting
 Management
 Etc.
 ​
 I know I'm not Houdini and this is standard but it'll lead up to my second question;
 I'm having a hell of a time splitting the files since I keep reaching "File count over limit".
 Any PowerShell scripts that have worked for you guys moving larger folders?
 I have tried a few different scripts but to no avail unfortunately.
 ​
 Any tricks would be greatly appreciated.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, so I’m trying to figure out this issue. So far a small group of users (2 or 3) are experiencing freezing whenever they receive an email via Outlook or Teams. We’re running M365 with exchange online. The freeze lasts roughly as long as the desktop notification then stops. We switched to M365 roughly 6 months ago, and this issue happened within the past 2 weeks. Now one thing thst happened was thst the feature preview caused the app bar at the bottom of the nav lane to move to the left side. That and us switching to FS Logix to replace roaming profiles are the only real changes that I know of. As far as troubleshooting goes I’ve disabled notifications for anything to show on desktop, rebuilt the local profile, rebuilt the outlook profile, disabled the updated apps bar, and no dice. I have not noticed this on the physical machine, only when removing via Citrix storefront to use RDP, or use the Citrix Desktop. We’re using on prem AD, Citrix VDA to support multiple users to one server, I’m one of the users effected. If anyone has any ideas or needs any clarification I am an open book ask me and I’ll answer. Thank you all for your help!!

 I got an account which is Google Workspace Business Starter. This gives me 30gb per user. In the past, if a user needed 100gb or more, in the storage section, the account could be upgraded for an extra amount per month or year. Google has killed off this feature.
 The only way forward is upgrading to Workspace business standard, which gives a 2Tb pooled storage. However, this also doubles the user/month cost, which does not sit well with the board. (Moving the whole business off the Google account is a nightmare I don't really want to face). 
 What other external storage options do you guys use? 
 Basically external storage, cloud or self hosted, not looking at OneDrive or Dropbox, as I'm hoping there is something that would be possible to integrate with Google drive.

 @Netflix: To everyone who stayed up late, woke up early, gave up their Sunday afternoon… we are incredibly sorry that the Love is Blind Live Reunion did not turn out as we had planned. We're filming it now and we'll have it on Netflix as soon as humanly possible. Again, thank you and sorry.
 Love is Blind is doing a live event. ~Apparently this is their first live event / episode.~ this is not the first live event.
 Servers are down, no one can connect. They communicated 15 minutes until online and now it's been 20.
 Oof.
 Update: 28 minutes in and still down
 Update 2: 43 minutes in, still down. The hosts posted an update on Instagram saying they're working on it still
 Update 3: 57 minutes in, still down. Maybe they have an internal go live at 6pm pst, one hour in?
 Update 4: 62 minutes in, still down. We're in this for the long haul. This is bad lmao especially since they have the cast there just awkwardly waiting until they can stream it live
 Update 5: 75 minutes in, still down. All influencers are now streaming from their Instagram accounts and it looks like chaos
 Update 6: POSSIBLE FIX: PLAY THE EPISODE 12 AND FAST FORWARD TO THE ENDING. THEN ITLL SAY NEXT EPISODE AND PLAY
 Update 7: Well, it played for about 2 minutes live and then crashed again
 I was able to get in after 86 minutes. Now I can't get in again. Some people are streaming it off their phone on TikTok and IG
 apparently Netflix canceled the live stream and they're just recording it to post later. Not sure how true this is but it seems it is, they're going ahead with the event. 
 Back to just loading

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[BGP novice here. Our growing company will soon be opening a secondary office/datacenter in a different geographic region. Our primary site/headquarters is currently single-homed and uses provider-assigned IP addresses, but will soon be multi-homed and our new site will be multi-homed from day one. Each site will be served by local ISPs that do not operate outside their respective regions. We will be getting full BGP tables from each ISP.
 Each site will have unique IPv6/IPv4 prefixes. There will be VPN tunnels between the two sites, but no direct/dedicated connectivity.
 Would there be any advantages to having a separate ASN for each site? Would there be any disadvantages other than additional RIR fees?
 I am aware of something that Cisco calls "neighbor allow-as". Would we need to use something like that if the two sites share an ASN, or would the simple fact that they are announcing unique prefixes ensure that their use of a shared ASN doesn't get treated as a BGP loop?
 If it matters, we hope to implement RPKI from the start and we wouldn't want the secondary site to have a ROA (Route Origin Authorization) that would allow it to announce prefixes used by the headquarters or vice versa. (Such as could happen accidentally due to misconfiguration, or if the site were to suffer a security breach.) My cursory understanding is that we will be able to have distinct ROAs for each site with only the prefixes assigned to that site, but I it would be great if someone could confirm that for me.
 Thanks in advance for any insight!

 - Will we lose power to the devices if there are any issues with the network (not loss of power to the actual switch)
 In addition to this, I was hoping you could help with the best option out of these 3, this would be in addition to requiring a network connection to the devices.
 - Use switch POE
 - Use POE Injector at device location
 - Use standard 24V Power supply for device

 The article below describes how the Fortigate VM may be trying to reach the Azure fabric at 168.63.129.16 incorrectly over an internal port instead of correctly over the external facing port.
 https://community.fortinet.com/t5/FortiGate/Technical-Tip-FortiGate-Azure-showing-virtual-machine-agent-not/ta-p/214315
 That all makes sense - until the last part of the article. It suggests that if an internal or external load balancer is used ( it is in our case we use both ) then 2 static routes to the Azure fabric are needed - one to the internal port and one to the external.
 We have that in place and still we have an error.
 Thing is i can't get my head around why a static route to 168.63.129.16 internal port is needed as well as a static route to 168.63.129.16 over the external port. It makes no sense.
 Any suggestions much appreciated.

We recently purchased a new M640 blade and I'm working on getting it installed. I had it loaded into slot 3 and was able to get ESXI installed on it with no issues....HOWEVER, when the new blade comes up, blade/hose 2 goes down network wise...and they fight each other for pings. If one is working, the other isn't. It's almost like they have the same ip address(which they don't) nor do any of the 4 nics have the same mac address that I can see. 
 It's a small network, flat with no vlans, so there's no special config R1-2401 vrtx switch.
 Has anyone ever run into this before?

As we are a cloud provider, I must do nearly everything you can imagine. So networking, backup, virtualization, storage, web, Linux, windows, mail, web servers, and the list goes on and on. It is like I do something new every day, even after more than 4 years, it is like I never get to the point I can say, yes, now I am really good at this topic. Besides this I am also doing other jobs here, non-IT related.
 My boss, now, came to the brilliant idea we can also do pen-testing as well. Just like that. Without some outside training. Just search how and do it. Not to mention he also ****** over employees if they leave.
 Oh and the hours, some months they seem without end. Like now...migrate exchange to some open source software. Search, try, implement, test, troubleshoot, document, etc.
 I am getting tired. Next week it is possible I will receive an offer, Linux job, a bit less pay, but better benefits.
 I am also afraid to change, Stockholm syndrome?
 I am tired.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Due to lack of availability of high-speed (2.5Gb, 10Gbit) small switches with the right combination of features from our usual enterprise brands, it's been suggested that we could consider an inversion of sorts, trunking through inexpensive but higher-speed unmanaged switches at the core and still use enterprise PoE+ switches at the edge.
 The idea currently is that all traffic going through the "dumb core" would be VLAN tagged; anything plugging into the core would be VLAN-aware. Besides the edge switches, the core would have at least one NAS and several Macs, for high-speed media sharing workflows.
 As an unusual architecture, I have zero doubt that /r/networking will love it immediately. Assuming that we're not going to have any end-users able to plug anything into the core and looping it up, what's the pro/con and has anyone run this in production?

I love technology but I'm struggling to see the benefits. The only thing I've found that is remotely objective is that PoE is low voltage and therefore, does not require conduits to be run for lighting. After factoring the cost of switches and maintenance of switches, Im not sure this is still a benefit. Is there a real benefit to PoE lighting?

I've been a sysadmin since around 1995 in various sectors, even in the past 10 years when I moved into cybersec I've still been in charge of huge chunk of our infrastucture as this was seen as an advantage when we had any incidents - I was familiar with it.
 I'm moving into a new role in May and while is almost triple my current salary I can't help but feel nervous as it's completely focused on cybersec, I've taken the jump as frankly I can't work under my new boss who's just a disaster waiting to happen.
 Any tips? I think it's likely impostor syndrome, I was headhunted for this role so I'm trying to see that as a vote of confidence.
 Perhaps some of this is guilt, since I put my notice in my entire team have quit or are working their notice too so we'll be leaving my current employer without a cyber sec team at all (8 staff gone in <2 months).

 I noticed after upgrading to Windows 11 22H2 from Windows 10 20H2/21H2 some vulnerabilities (Nessus) appeared for apps like 3D viewer, Paint 3D and the new Windows Terminal. This is because these are Microsoft Store Apps that require updates.
 If you're in an air-gapped environment this proves difficult as everything points to GitHub, third party sites, or a license to get an Appx installer for offline networks. It's possible to update these apps but if your workplace is very hard set on risk avoidance instead of remediation you can remove these applications with PowerShell.
 You'll need to utilize the Remove-AppxPackage and Remove-ProvisionedAppxPackage Cmdlet to "uninstall" the Appx. 
 Nessus showed vulnerabilities for these apps afterwards because the Windows app directory exist for the vulnerable Appx here: C:\Program Files\WindowsApps. You'll need to remove the Directory related to the removed Appx. I've only had luck removing these directories by running as SYSTEM via MECM.
 Something to note, if you remove the WindowsApps Appx Directory before running the PowerShell commands above you will not be able to remove the Appx with PowerShell.

 Im new as sysadmin, and i have checked alot of resources to resolve this but no luck. Hope that you guys can guide me through this step.
 So basically, users cannot install apps without an admin permission. Risk has just raised a point that they are able to download and run portable applications. I have been assigned to block that.
 In our environment, we are using ManageEngine Central, i thought of uaing that to implement this policy, but there was no such option. The optiones offered by GPO is to block specific application installation by either name of hash, i need it to be general for all portable apps.
 I have imported a full list of all applications installed in our environment, thought of creating a whitelist and prohibiting any other application, but no luck in that as well as im not sure which solution to use to enforce this scenario.
 The department is willing to purchase a solution and implement it to control such aspects, as security has a magnificent intrest of the management. Please let me know if any solution provides this capability.
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning!
 Recently some tickets have been showing up and being escalated to me about users who can't open excel spreadsheets on a file share because they are locked by an unknown user. When I check Open Files on the file share I can see who has them open. Well, I asked the user if they could close out of the spreadsheet if they were done and they replied that they didn't even have it open. Sure enough there was no lock file in the directory either. If I kill the open file, then another user can open it but this problem repeats itself randomly.
 I'm starting to think it's a share permission or drive permission that's causing this but everything looks good... Is there a way to analyze permissions through directory trees (like see an overview of what the user has permissions to do starting from the root of the share) or is this something else entirely? I've googled like a madman and everything just says to remove lock files or close it from Open Files on the server itself.

 Hope this makes sense. Renewed the RootCA cert on a 2 tier install last week.
 I renewed the offline Root CA. No issues here. Took files and copied them over to SubCA and the other server where IIS is running. Did the certutil DSpublish command on the crt file and crl file. Command ran ok and says added to the DS store.
 When I look in pkiview though I have an error on the root level for AIA Location #2. Says Unable to download. The path is correct but it has the old RootCa crt file name listed and not the new one. Everything on the SubCA in PKIView shows OK and the AIA has the new root (3) file listed etc just fine.
 AIA Location #2 Unable to Download http://pki.domain.com/crl/name1(2).crt.crt) and it should be name1(3).crt.
 Both the old RootCA cert (2) and the new (3) exist at that path and I can see them when browsing to that location in a browser and both files will download fine.
 If I go into Manage AD Containers , the new renewed root ca cert shows up under Certificate Authorities Container tab as well as the AIA Container tab correctly. I cannot figure out why everything appears ok, but the file name is not updated in the pki path to the new cert name and it says unable to download. Both the old file (2) and new one (3) have the same permissions.
 What would cause that, and how can I change it? I have done this twice in the past and not encountered this.

 I'm guessing something to do with VSS snapshots?
 The reason for my question is that a customer is using WSB to backup a VM with an encrypted OS.
 The backup is showing as an Offline backup - I'm assuming that this machine will not be able to be restored in a running state thus undermining the disk encryption?
 Is an offline backup just a backup of the VHDX not in a running state?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone ever done a Unit4 ERP implementation? What’s your impression of the company? What was the process like?
 Currently I’m the IT person on the project team handling SSO and user provisioning and I can wholeheartedly say that they leave a really bad impression in every possible way so far. Their in-house consultants are absolutely clueless and the processes are archaic. I am just in shock after every meeting.
  
You want SSO? Create a ticket and someone in a completely different time zone will not read your request properly and it will take days to sort things out.
 What does the user status “Parked” and “Terminated” mean? No clue. One “consultant” went so far as to suggest to read F1 help - which of course did not help.
 What should be considered when choosing a user ID? Silence.
 Generally they can maybe answer about 10% of the questions, for the rest they need to ask someone else. Sometimes they even get back to you after that.
  
It’s a bit of a nightmare and other departments engaging with different consultants share that feeling. Curious what your experience is. Or does just every ERP implementation suck?

Was working toward the AZ-104 when I sort of got side tracked with PowerShell and have been focusing on that almost exclusively, currently working through the book 'PowerShell in Action', but I have moments of wondering if it's a bit overkill since it is a substantially deeper lever than anywhere near what is needed in my environment. 
 Still definitely have AZ-104 on my radar as well as eventually trying to learn Python, as I do not currently know any other languages. 
 My lack of networking knowledge/experience has made me consider pursuing a CCNA, but really I don't know if I have an interest in being a networking engineer outside of some of the salaries that I see. 
 I know. It's not all about money. But when you are in your early 30s with 2 kids and nothing meaningful saved up for retirement it does start to be about money. Looking for the biggest return on my time investment and am struggling to develop a concrete plan going forward for the next 5-10 years. 
 Please help.

But AppLocker works on any current cumulative update for Win11 and Win10 Pro, even if managed by group policy - it no longer requires Enterprise.
 So this is actually a massive improvement over needing to use SRPs, but Microsoft never really announced SRPs would stop being enforced so it's a security risk if you don't know to roll out AppLocker.
 The article on AppLocker being enabled for all editions is referring to some older updates but a lot of people are reporting it didn't start working until more recently. https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5024351-removal-of-windows-edition-checks-for-applocker-e3a763c9-6a3e-4d9c-8623-0ffe69046470

 I'm not sure I could even step half the users through noting off of USB, but that seems to be the only other option by making a boot USB, shipping it to them, and tailoring it to automatically run the tool to reset the admin password? Anything like that exist?

 I slotted in the new blade and saw it's firmware was higher than the CMC firmware so the CMC needed to be updated. 
 Got the CMC updated to the latest firmware; however, the internal nics will not come up to allow the blade access to external network. 
 Nics are all enabled on the R1-2401 and I can see blades one and 2 have all of their nics active, but this new blade will not bring them up. I've even gone into the switch an shut/no shut the ports to see if that would bring them up and nadda.
 ​
 Any thoughts? I'm not very familiar with the old VRTX chassis

I'm on your side, I know how valuable what you do is. In this sub though I see so much hostility to even relatively non-intrusive sales outreach like emails and LinkedIn here. 
 I don't understand why the default assumption is that any cold outreach is not possibly worth considering. I occasionally work with IT directors/managers but usually non-technical decision makers, and typically if I can provide a valid reason for why I wanted to reach out to them, they are happy to hear the 10 second version, provide a maybe or no, then potentially book a meeting.
 I'm biased, but it seems insane to me to assume anyone who emails you twice should be blocked - how do you know it's not a good product or service? Your job depends on sales and marketing too, you wouldn't be employed if sales and marketing teams at your company weren't pitching plenty of good products and services, the level of vitriol doesn't compute to me?

 ​
 Hello Everyone,
 I'm working on migrating all the DLs of the organisation across all the locations.
 So we have DLs with the domain [admin@oranges.com](mailto:admin@oranges.com) and newly created DLs with [admin@apples.com](mailto:admin@apples.com) domain.
 I am looking to convert all of them to [admin@apples.com](mailto:admin@apples.com).
 My plan is :
  
export all the DLs via PS in CSV (How would I do that)
 Remove new DLs (as they are already in the new domain) and teams groups (someone told me it will also show private teams groups).
 Add @ apples.com domain to the DLs.
 Make @ apples.com domain as primary domain.
  
Is it how am I suppose to do or is there any better idea?
 To approximately 50 most used DLs, I migrated them manually, also renamed as it had old company name in the Display name.
 Now I can't think of texting individual DL owners to see if they are still in use, so I am just thinking of migrating all of them.
 Please help how would go about this, any help is appreciated.

 I'm pretty sure scanners and copiers are something that is still used in some office settings so this this information maybe valuable to someone.
 ​
 If you have a brother multi-function printer that includes a document scanner and you keep getting an error scanner is not connecting you can always try removing this update and see if it starts working again for you.

 Currently my company advocates for static IP at the printers. We had some printers get moved around and lost their connections. I was told is because the new ports are not on the same subnet. I have no idea what that means but it sounded cool. 
 The other thing that is going on, the network guys want to subnet for printers and other collections. This means we have to re-IP all printers.
 I suggested that we us hostnames/FQDN for printers and it was like I was talking about someone religion, or their parents, or the best motor oil. 
 It seems to me if we go with a standard host naming convention and connected to those printers via FQDN rather than IP, things would run a lot smoother and the network chasers can re-IP all they want. 
 what is/are the best business practices here, short of chaining the printers to the wall?

In the process of replacing it with a 7600 ES+ card (76-ES+XC-20G3C) I had both in the chassis and pretty much copy pasted the config for each interface in use and unplugged the cables and SFPs from the old card and plugged them into the new one.
 Apr 15 10:24:24 EST: %TRANSCEIVER-3-OPER_ENABLE_FAILURE: Detected for transceiver module in GigabitEthernet4/10, module disabled 
 Some SFPs were disabled. A few SFPs, I only noticed after I took another look at them are actually DS-SFP-GE-T, not SFP-GE-T.
 I added service unsupported-transceiver and no errdisable detect cause gbic-invalid, but it made no difference.
 Is there no workaround for this? In the first place, what is DS-SFP-GE-T?? It doesn't show up in the Cisco transceiver compatibility tool, DS makes me think mds9000 maybe? But it worked without complaint in the older linecard while it won't work even with unsupported-transceiver in the ES+ one. 
 Right now I have both still installed until I probably end up getting the right SFPs, wondering if this was to be expected, on switches the hidden commands pretty much let you use any standard SFP with a scary warning prompt but on this platform it didn't even show me the warning, though it didn't have any effect either.

 Wondering if anyone has dealt with this issue and how they approached it. We have a few users who are being constantly locked out by brute force attempts (about 50 attempts every hour). The users have MFA so we aren't too concerned about them gaining access but finding it frustrating having to constantly unlock the accounts. We have conditional access policies in place but because the conditional access takes effect after first factor it doesn't prevent the lockout. I have reached out to our Contact at Microsoft for some advice also but thought I would check in here as well for any other ideas

 I'm experimenting with Telnet in a home lab setting, I'd like to connect to another machine from my main laptop and I'm having the following issue: I get the message “Connecting to 192.168.0.62… Could not open connection to the host, on port 23: Connect failed”.
 Here is a breakdown.
 ​
  
I want to connect with Laptop 1 to Laptop 2.
 Laptop 1: Windows 10 / IP address 192.168.0.55.
 Laptop 2: Windows 10 / IP address 192.168.0.62.
 Both are connected to the same wireless network.
 When attempting to use Telnet on Laptop 1 to connect to Laptop 2, I get the following message in CMD, with admin privileges, “Connecting to 192.168.0.62… Could not open connection to the host, on port 23: Connect failed”. 
 Telnet client is activated on both machines.
 Firewall settings on Laptop 1 enable me to use Telnet. I tested this and was able to connect to another machine, a Linux laptop, on the same network, without any issue. I totally disabled the firewall on Laptop 2, and I’m still having issues when using Telnet.
 I can connect to Laptop 2 using RDP on Laptop 1.
 Rebooting did not solve the issue.
 
  
Has anyone run into this issue before or have any suggestions? Cheers!

 Long:
 I recently dealt with a website that was compromised. There was a credit card stealer script embedded on the webserver. The script was caught by our antivirus software on a user PC they they went to buy something on this website. My user raised a ticket and I investigated. I knew nothing about this vendor of ours besides the domain. I queried the domain registrar for the owner email address and got the private registration proxy one. Armed with this information I fired a quick email to the following addresses about the security incident:
  
Registrar proxy
 abuse@
 security@
 webmaster@
 hostmaster@
 support@ 
  
The IT team of the vendor resolved the issue and I got a thank you email from them.
 However, of all these, only the webmaster@ address worked, the rest bounced back. I have come across this more frequently as new generation of sysadmins xome onboard, they don't know about this. So please, setup an alias or shared mailbox to monitor these accounts!

 I have a strange case with NTLM.
 I've configured my domain controllers, servers & clients to use LAN Manager Authentication Level : Send NTLMv2 response only, Refuse LM & NTLM.
 I've double checked everything, even in the registry LSA -> Lmcompatibility is 5. 
 If I look into the domain controllers security event viewer, I still see pretty much events with NTLM v1 successful logons (event 4624). I think that this is because of certain computers which aren't using the FQDN to connect to a share. 
 I'm just worried why it still shows me NTLM v1.... All the devices are W10, W11 & W2016 and as I understood, it should enforce NTLM v2.
 Do I miss something ? 
 ​

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! 
 I've been trying for a few days to setup a IKEv2 PSK (for simplicity) VPN server. This server should run as a virtual machine on a proxmox deployment. I've disabled proxmox's firewall for this specific machine 
 The host is behind a Mikrotik CRS326 router, on which i have configured port forwarding for ports 500 and 4500 UDP to the VPN server (at 192.168.1.7) in the dstnat chain, the firewall rules to allow traffic on those ports via the UDP ports are also in place. 
 The current /etc/ipsec.conf config is this one: 
 config setup
 charondebug="ike 1, knl 1, cfg 0"
 uniqueids=no
 ​
 conn ikev2-vpn
 auto=add
 compress=no
 type=tunnel
 keyexchange=ikev2
 fragmentation=yes
 forceencaps=yes
 ike=aes256-sha1-modp1024,3des-sha1-modp1024!
 esp=aes256-sha1,3des-sha1!
 dpdaction=clear
 dpddelay=300s
 rekey=no
 left=%any
 leftid=192.168.1.7
 leftcert=/etc/ipsec.d/certs/vpn-server-cert.pem
 leftsendcert=always
 leftsubnet=0.0.0.0/0
 right=%any
 rightid=%any
 rightauth=eap-mschapv2
 rightdns=192.168.1.1
 rightsourceip=10.20.30.0/24
 rightsendcert=never
 eap_identity=%identity
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 When i try to connect i see exactly one packet on port 500 on mikrotik's counter for firewall rules, well, NAT rules in this case and that's it, nothing more, the phone i'm testing this with gives up and states "disconnected", the whole process take 1-2 seconds. 
 I really have 0 idea what i did wrong.

 I am working on an assignment which basically has the question of identifying an exploit with a relevant CVE that would allow for TCP session identification. The closest I could find to this was CVE-1999-0667 with ARP spoofing, where the cache is poisoned to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.
 I am however confused, as I do not know if this constitutes as an exploit or just a technique within an exploit. I tried my hardest to skim through thousands of CVEs to see if there were any exploits related to the identification of TCP sessions, but most of them were just denial-of-service attacks.
 I would appreciate some clarification on this topic because I am just so lost

 I get that a SYN/ACK would be used in this case over a proxy server, but is that it?

After this, I do not know if the scanner host would send a RST or an ACK to the target network.

I have been asked to retrieve some of the data on this unit so I don’t think I should do that. Does anyone know of any other options? 
 Also, I cant seem to find any technical documentation on this unit. With the WD and DDN acquisitions I have no idea where to get any documentation….. or what support number I can call. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As the title suggest, I’m looking for an alternative for WSUS. In the last 24hrs I’ve been fighting the console along with other menial tasks that come along with the platform. I finally came to terms to just blow the install all away to start fresh again. I’ve been working with WSUS for the last 6yrs now with plenty of headaches I’d like to get rid of. So I’m reaching out to find some other patch management suggestions. We are a small business, I’m sure we can manage about 5k/yr but I’m trying to find something a little lower on the cost side if any. Also, if the solution could inventory the machines and present what patches are needed by machines (similar to WSUS), that would be a bonus. So what do you all have for me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Microsoft seems to be testing the waters with this announcement, with some sort of phased reveal - it's only visible in one of the three tenants I have access to. The link, if you have it, is https://admin.microsoft.com/Adminportal/Home?ref=MessageCenter/:/messages/MC541626 If you don't have it, here are the screenshots: https://imgur.com/a/qVMQxbl
 Basically it's a new feature coming where when you click a link in an email in Outlook on Windows, it opens Edge with a copy of the email as a side panel. Sounds kind of neat.
 But to make sure everyone experiences this, Outlook will also start ignoring your system's default web browser and opening links in Edge no matter what. Users whose default has always been Chrome, and whose bookmarks and saved passwords are all in Chrome, will be highly confused by a very similar-looking browser that has none of their stuff. They'll probably call the helpdesk screaming "why did you delete all my stuff?!?!"
 The user can change this in settings, but options being offered for admins to shut this off is lacking. Both options listed (the cloud policy service and group policy) explicitly apply only to Microsoft 365 Apps for enterprise (not business).
 So, for SMBs there seems to be no way out besides manually touching each machine. Of course, it remains to be seen if perhaps the end-user setting is in a registry key instead of some secret place... we can only hope...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last week my employer (a large robotics company) hired an MSP to work as our help desk. We had a different MSP for 10 years but due to some contract negotiation differences, we could not come to an agreement. The new MSP needed Jump boxes in the environment to use as administration systems to work from. 
 ​
 They requested 18 boxes 1 for each person. the box requested was a server 2016+ and local admin rights plus rights to have basic administration of DNS, DHCP, etc. We provided the boxes and the accounts. 
 ​
 Today (yay Friday!) I happen to refresh my server manager and find a few new ADCS boxes. So I looked at all servers on the network to find what roles were installed. I found many jump boxes had ADCS, ADFS, ADDS, DHCP, DNS, and ADLDS. etc. Many even had LDS instances. 
 ​
 I contacted the Helpdesk manager and asked why these servers have these roles installed when they are only meant for jump boxes and they didn't follow the documented change management process. 
 He then proceeded to respond "We needed these so we could administrate these services on the servers," I asked him why they didn't use RSAT because installing these roles leaves the environment up to more risks. He seemed surprised at the existence of RSAT. 
 ​
 I am very frustrated that the MSP would install and configure critical roles on jump boxes in the environment but I am also Dumbfounded that the basic tools for administration seemed to be unknown to them and it makes me question their knowledge. They to me seem to be a huge risk at this point. 
 ​
 Would it be a deal breaker for anyone here? Would you cancel the contract?

 The week started with it was "Excel not working" < The application was working fine, the issue was that they incorrectly formatted an excel formula. 
 Wednesday (8am): "Cant connect, please assist" < Turns out they decided to WFH, knows damn well we disable VPN accounts inactive for 2 weeks, and neglected to advise us. 
 Thursday it was: "My computer isn't working, tried restart" < This one was actually an issue, But I checked task manager and they did not reboot the machine, in 5 days. A reboot fixed the issue
 just now, Friday 4PM "The scanner needs to be cleaned" *send PHOTO of a screen with a notification* saying "IF your scanned doc has vertical lines it needs to be cleaned". 22 minutes later I am still waiting to see a document that has vertical lines. The scanned document is FINE...
 The most hilarious part of this is they claim to have taken a post secondary I.T course.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All,
 Our current environment is Windows Server and laptop based using local AD synced to Azure and Exchange Online.
 My co-worker in IT, which also turns out to be a middle manager, wants to transition the company (small to medium sized) from Windows based laptops to Chromebooks. My co-worker believes there will be less maintenance of the devices themselves such as constantly dealing with driver issues (Dell), plus they're much cheaper. 
 Obviously we'd have to virtualize any app so it can be accessible through a browser, which only would be a couple or so, and we'd have to start managing the devices via MDM. We would keep Exchange Online and Azure for email and authentication. 
 I'm trying my hardest to keep an open mind about this as I do not want to be a hinderance to new ideas, and this would fall mostly on me to make this transition happen, at least infrastructure wise.
 I would just like to know what any of y'all think of the idea of transitioning to Chromebook based laptops/tablets.

Working with a new var on upgrading an asr9910, requirements for the card ports are 6 40 gig ports and a handful of 10 gig with the possibility of upgrading two 40 gig ports to 100. A quote for a a9k-8hg-flex-fc was coming out to 174k per card with a 177k license per card for a 400g license which seems high. An original quote for a 400g line card with the bare minimum ports was about 60k each and 60 for the license. Is this just obnoxiously high or just cisco? Anyone have similar quotes from juniper or nokia? Those would be a full chassis quote at this point. The total bw on the backplane doesn’t go above 200g with a potential of upgrading to 3-340g.

 (for instance, teaming 2 NICs for a vmware vSwitch)
 Speed? Reliability? Load balancing for some reason?
 The reason i ask is that i have teamed NICs for the vSwitches in a few esx servers, but mostly because thats how it was set up on the first esx server i saw.
 I dont think that teaming two 1gbit NICs gives much better speed (for me, here).
 Both NICs are connected to the same switch, and the router mostly only has 1gbit NICs anyway, so i dont think much traffic would go over that limit anyway.
 And yeah, both NICs are connected to the same switch, so if that breaks its bye bye anyway.
 But yeah, i get some redundancy if one port on that dual-port card breaks i guess.
 Anyway, when you team NICs, do you always make sure they are connected to separate switches?
 And what more to think of?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the years, I've seen many debates about the value of certs.
 Just 3.5 months into my full-time career, I've landed a 'Senior Network & Security Analyst' role, and I believe truly having my CCNA helped A TON.
 First off, the last thing I'm trying to do here is brag/gloat. This is an anonymous forum and no-one knows me here. Simply trying to share my experience so that it can hopefully help others.
 For background, I have 1 year (three 4 month co-ops) internship experience, and have been working at my full time role for 3.5 months.
 Before anyone says anything about the 'validity' of the role/company, my new company is a huge employer and big bank.
 I understand this is Reddit and you should take my post with a grain of salt. You might have huge skepticism over if this is a true post or not.
 Luck/timing plays a big role. Clearly I don't have 'senior' level experience, but I do interview well, do have some work experience, but most importantly, I have my CCNA and DevNet, along with some network automation projects I listed on my resume (and no, not just simple projects from school. These are my own individual projects). I believe these factors were a massive help in me landing the role (the role said CCNP would be a nice-to-have and that automation experience was a plus).
 Another myth I want to shatter is about applying to jobs 'out of your league'. Again, by all accounts I should not have landed the role as I am only 3.5 months into my full-time career. But clearly there weren't too many eligible candidates and my new employer is deciding to take a chance on me.
 So just apply to any and every job that catches your eye. And there is absolutely no arbitrary 'time' you have to stay at a job before you want to move. I am the proof.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working on upgrading our switches to IBNS 2.0 config and up till now I've had little to no issues.
 We have mostly 3850s with a handful of 9XXX series switch's and just a few 2960c's
 I think I'm running into a bug with these ones. We have the port template use a parked vlan (666) and we do vlan assignment via ISE policy. When I try to do this on this switch it seems to tear down the mab session and repeat it forever. ISE logs show repeated successes and the debugs show successful vlan, dacl and SGT assignment but then immediately tear down and start over. My work around has been to just blow out the template onto the port statically as well as set the vlan statically everything works fine if I do that. and I'm fine with keeping it that way for now. However I'd still like to know. I'm likely to put in a tac case today but I'd figure I'd share in case anyone else is in my boat. 
 I've got a switch on my desk with more or less the same config and I'm unable to replicate the issue at least most of the time. Although I don't have 100% the same endpoints to test with.
 anyway here is the switch facts:
 WS-C2960C-8PC-L 15.2(7)E7 C2960c405-UNIVERSALK9-M
 ​
 Running config: https://pastebin.com/ETUVA3JU
 Debug of an example endpoint:
 debug radius authentication
 debug epm all
 debug radius verbose
 debug ip device tracking interface

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just wondering what the preferred setup for this is. We currently have a DMZ that is all on one VLAN. I got the directive to prevent east/west. The two easiest solutions I could come up with are switch it to a PVLAN or setup the host firewalls and just block traffic from the DMZ subnet. Harder solution would be split the VLAN up which would require readdressing the servers.
 Since I don't manage the servers, I think the PVLAN is the best solution I could implement. Anyone have their DMZ setup like this? Any downsides or concerns I may be overlooking? Most use-cases I see when researching are for segmenting customer traffic or guest networks.

 What are some of the jobs/things/operations you do on a daily/weekly/monthly basis and deem as standard or normal that would be a reason for a pay raise.
 Im bad at explaining this but i need bullet points i can hit with so that i can argue why i need a raise. 
 I do all the normal stuff a ~10000 user networking engineer/professional does, but im looking at things i might have overlooked but can be classified as specialized work.
 I feel like this is harder than nessecary, as daily upkeepings and tickets keeps rolling in they dont nessecarily keep increasing in complexity, but the hole of everything still gets expanded daily. 
 Again. Just looking at pointers and maybe even normal operations that may be deemed as things to be taking with me in negotiations in the next conversation.
 ANY reply is welcomed.

 We just got a fancy new Fluke LinkIQ network tester. When we do a PoE test with it, we get two results: HW Class and Software Negotiated Class. The HW Class usually shows Class 3 and the SW Class shows Class 4. What is the difference between the two and why is one Class 3 and the other Class 4?
 The Fluke documentation just says:
  
The hardware negotiated power class (Class 0 to Class 8) of the PSE device.
  
and
  
The software negotiated power class (Class 1 to Class 8) of the device.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi wonderful Reddit community! I am in IT but not in networking specifically. I was hoping someone smart here could help me with the puzzle I have.
 Preface: Long time ago a very experienced networking engineer told me to never run a single ping packet. This is because, even aside of packet drops, there could be some other problems (if I recall correctly, related to ARP resolution) that may fail connection on the first ping, but succeed on subsequent ones.
 Some facts (all of this is true with default parameters): * When in Windows I ping something it runs 4 pings. * When in Linux I ping something it pings continuously. * When in PowerShell I use Test-Connection it runs 4 pings. * When in PowerShell I use Test-NetConnection it runs one ping (validated with WireShark).
 Question: Can someone tell me if that networking engineer was right?
 Bonus question: If that networking engineer was right, does that mean that Test-NetConnection is a bad command?
 (Please don’t dig deep into command parameters, ports etc. - the question is about icmp)

We moved into a shared office space with another business, we are both using Shaw as our provider, me with the business plan and them with the home plan. As soon as I arrive at the office and connect to our company WiFi me and the guy across from me (other business) start dropping connection. Sometimes we drop connection a few times a day, sometimes I can only maintain connection for 2-3 minutes at a time, dropping connection intermittently. Our SSID's are on different channels, and our modems are both running through the same coax cable with a splitter. My company is running a Meraki for WiFi with the modem bridged, they are connecting directly to their modem. Does anyone have any idea why our WiFi would be interfering with each other?

 Identicly deployed the 365 apps for enterprise to roughly 25 RDS session hosts via ODT, all working fine bar one host which is refusing to activate any users licence, after signing in with an appropriately licenced user or users I still get the big dirty ' (non commercial use) (unlicenced Product)' across the top.
 ​
  
I can't see any firewall issue, local windows firewall is disabled like the other hosts, and I can't see anything stopping the traffic, it is in the same network as the other working session hosts.
 I have tried usual reinstall/repairs both online and offline.
 Redeploy via ODT again it installs again ok but fails to activate.
 tried clearing credential manager.
 Tried running the support and recovery assitant tool.

 running the clean up scripts provided by MS:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/activation/reset-office-365-proplus-activation-state#sectionb
 Verified the registry value for shared licensing is set to 1.
 I am able to get to the sign in prompt, but it doesn't go anything with the creds, no username is registered so I can returned the sign in option again.

 Just wondering if anyone has come accross a really obscure answer to this one?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Everyone,
 Sorry if this isn't quite the right sub for this post. I have a question about a setup I came across at a small business. I didn't set it up, but the current setup doesn't really make sense to me so I'd like some help understanding.
 The business has two DSL connections. The first one is their internet connection. 
 The second one is just creating a secure connection to a remote server that they need to access. The remote server they are accessing is at 100.100.0.1. This DSL modem is expecting a client to connect on port LAN4 at a client IP of 100.50.50.254, with a default gateway of 100.50.50.1. If I connect my laptop to LAN4, assign a static IP of 100.50.50.254, and a default gateway of 100.50.50.1, I can ping 100.100.0.1 no problem. That all makes sense. 
 They are using a Cisco RV042G as their primary Router/Firewall. This router has a WAN port and a WAN/DMZ port. Currently it is configured in WAN + DMZ mode. 
 The WAN port is connected to their first DSL modem, the modem is in Bridge Mode, and the router is setup to login using PPPoe. All internet traffic is routed through this connection.
 In the settings for the DMZ port, it has the option to select a subnet or range. Subnet is selected, and an IP of 100.50.50.254 is inputted in there. There is then a static route setup for 100.100.0.1, to be routed out the DMZ Interface. 
 My understanding is the DMZ port as configured is supposed to be used to give a direct internet connection to a specific device, keeping it seperate from your LAN, and bypassing all firewall rules. 
 But how it is being used is more like a dual WAN setup, with no Failover or Load Balancing, but where all internet traffic is routed out one WAN port, and only specific traffic is routed out the second WAN port. 
 Can anyone help clear up what is going on here, and what would be the preferred way of setting this up? Thanks,

 My question is, is, can you install hyper V in such a way that you don’t have the entire windows OS under it? That way all you’re running is hyper V on the bare metal with all of the VMs under it. (Dell Servers) 
 It’s just something I’ve never researched or known if it’s possible 
 To be honest, I’ve never installed the server OS without the GUI.
 I’m just really admitting my ignorance I’m just curious. To see if there’s a better way sometimes it seems like a waste to have the full OS just sitting there doing nothing when hyper V is doing 99% of the work on the post.

 (I’m not talking about hybrid exchange) 
 I am in the process of onboarding servers to MDE and noticed that our exchange server is not listed in Azure AD as a device. Running dsregcmd /status shows it’s only joined to ADDS, it’s OU is part of the Azure AD connect sync, issue seems to be it will not add certs to the local personal cert store and Workplace Join task exits with 0x1 response. 
 I can’t find documentation if an exchange server can be joined like this. Because it does not show in Azure it means I can assign it to the Azure AD group for MDE settings. 
 Anyone got any ideas ? Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morning! 
 We recently installed a NUC11TNBV7 device in a room with a NEC monitor. To connect the device to the monitor we had to use a USB C to displayport cable. 
 The NUC displays an image when first turned on, but if the monitor is power cycled, the image stays black, and eventually the monitor will go back to sleep since it's not receiving an image. 
 I've updated the thunderbolt drivers, the bios, and the VGA drivers in the NUC but nothing seems to work. I've checked the power plan settings on the device as well as adjusting to maximum performance in the BIOS. 
 Interesting enough, unlike the other nucs in the room, when you vnc into the device with the monitor off it shows the full 1920x1080 and a monitor connected, while the older nucs revert to 800x600 and no monitor connected. 
 Due to the configuration of this room, using the HDMI out of the NUC is currently not an option. My next step will be to order an active HDMI to displayport cable. 
 Our NUC10's have no issue using USB-C to DP. I'm Curious if anyone else has any experience with USB-C display out issues with these NUC11 and if you have a solution.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our telecom team is moving off of our old on-prem VoIP and going to a cloud hosted solution. We tried to future proof ourselves years ago so we have ample campus bandwidth (small user count, 10G everywhere, DC and user traffic totally separated) so we never had a real reason to try and shoot ourselves in the foot with a bad QoS policy - but now with projects winding down we all collectively decided that now is a good time to take a look at it.
 I've been going through Cisco Live's breakout sessions and am starting to get a grasp, but the whole "cloud hosted VoIP" piece is throwing a wrench in my machine. Below are the guidelines that I'm trying to follow:
  
Marking DSCP as close to the source as possible - We're moving off of Cisco phones, so part of my testing is to use "auto qos voice trust" and see if the DSCP values stick with non-Cisco phones at the access port level, not just uplinks.
 QoS policies in hardware, not software
 Specifically call out VoIP as EF/AF46/COS5
  
Where I'm really lost is the cloud bit. As far as I know, ISPs don't give a toss about your DSCP markings and we aren't peering directly with this cloud service, so while the QoS that we haven't needed before would (well, might if we dont mess it up) work internally, all this work is going to be for nothing if we ship VoIP packets out into the wild internet and they get trampled.
 Is this just part of the known risk when going to a cloud service? I've asked for some technical documentation from them and we will have meeting where I can pepper them with questions, I'm just trying to get my ducks in a row and not be an IT dinosaur. 
 VoIP in the cloud, exciting times.
 Quick edit, I'm heavily leaning on this Cisco Live BRKCRS-2501 session and have a QoS book queued up in O'Reilly Books that I'll chew on over the next month

 One of our domain controller which is physical computer installed in a other site far away from my office, has no trust relation with our Active Directory, so it’s impossible for us to access it anymore. It happened after a “little” mistake was made. Basically this server is gonna be replaced and we need to clone it and redeploy it on a new VM in our hyperV cluster, for a specific software installed on it. So the clone was done, using disk2vhd cloning C: of that server, and mounted on a new VM, the new vm wasn’t connected with network until the IP was changed, but to change the name of that new VM, it was needed to downgrade the VM from DC to non DC, and to do this it had to be connected to the network, and it’s at that moment where we had the conflict, which made our physical machine loose the trust relationship and removed itself from our AD.
 Has anyone of you an idea on how to make the physical server re join our AD and being able to connect on it ? Beside going physically on site where the server is located which is a 6 hour drive from office. We can’t connect with any AD account because no trust relation, and no local account possible because it’s a domain controller.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So hi,
 i am somewhat lost about how to proceed here.
 for as long as i can remember, i had no problem to propagate a specific website as startpage/homepage via policy, including those that are defined as "preferred" or "not locked", be it either per group policy for edge & chrome, or policies.json in Firefox.
 what exactly happens when a new policy, defined as "preferred" or "not locked" is applied, but a different setting already exists for a user?
 because all of sudden, i am getting a heap load of complaints, that for two different customers, and two different browsers (edge & firefox), the browser does not load the correct new startpage we have set per policy. for one customer, in edge it's set per GPO and for the other customer, in firefox it's set via policies.json.
 for firefox i was able to verify, one user has the old homepage set in his profile prefs.js. when i remove this, the policy applies as it should. the user didn't change anything homepage related on his end, he doesn't even touch firefox at all as he prefers edge. all users i talked to assert they have not set another homepage, and still there seem to be some user-specific changes to said setting. is there any way a differing setting could end up in the user-specific settings by other means?
 anyways, it appears the per-user-setting has priority. did this behaviour change recently? because i can't remember i've ever had this much trouble with policies like these before, and since 1-2 month ago, an alarming amount of people report this problem...

This was only discovered after finding that the logs had been filling up for over a year and auto-archiving, ending up generating over 840GB of logs over that time span. I can't find any reason for this system to be doing this.
 The other systems don't have ANY logs related to SeBackupPrivilege. Anyone have any ideas on what might be happening? So far my searches have turned up nothing useful.
 For reference, in a 24 hour period, the unaffected systems generate about 76,000 Security Log events - whereas the affected system is about double that, and the extra 76,000 are all related to SeBackupPrivilege.
 I will not be able to provide any actual logs due to the company policy, but still hope someone has some ideas on what it could be.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've come across a weird issue this morning with machines running M365 current channel. We've tested this on some of our machines running the latest build, 16227.20280. Checking for updates through any of the apps, it will start to download an apply an update. Once this has completed, M365 is downgraded to the build that was released on March 20th, 16130.20332.
 We're able to manually update back to the latest build by using the C2R updater and referencing the build number: "C:\Program Files\Common Files\microsoft shared\ClickToRun\OfficeC2RClient.exe" /update user updatetoversion=16.0.16227.20280
 Going through the GUI update process will again downgrade it to 16130.20332.
 Checking our registries, we can see that in HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Office\ClickToRun\Configuration, the "VersionToReport" key references the latest build. My assumption is that this entry is used when checking for updates.
 So, maybe some funny business at Microsoft's end this morning? Anybody else experiencing this?

 I'm goin to have to clean a lot of vlans from around 10 Cisco Catalyst switches with IOS-XE, and I'm wondering what would be the best way to do so, a bit of introduction, some of em are in RSTP domain but not all, some of em aren't declared in vlan db anymore but still on the "allowed trunk" list in interfaces. 
 I'd like to automate it as much as possible, and i was looking at ntc-templates, the main process should be 
  
I decide i need to eliminate vlan 333
 Find, hopefully with some kind of automation, every port where the vlan is explicitly allowed but not the trunk all ports
 "no vlan 333"
 "no spanning-tree vlan 333"
 for every interface found at point 2, do "switchport trunk allowed vlan remove 333" still, with some kind of automation
 
 I'm no expert with ansible, ntc-templates and so on, but I like to get shits done in the most efficient wave, and I'm willing to invest a bit of time in this cause for sure it'll spare a ton of time for me and my team in the future, so, what are your suggestions to do this kind of thing in the most efficient way? 
 Thanks in advance!

 I do not have Administrator rights on my workstation.
 I have a situation where my main Adapter is split up to one Tagged adapter and one Untagged adapter.
 The Tagged adapter and Untagged adapter have IPv4 configurations.
 The main Adapter has IPv4/6 disabled. This is standard with the Intel PROSet configuration tool.
 Now the problem is when updates are pushed to this workstation, the two 'sub'Adapters (the tagged and untagged ones with ip config) dissapear and are deleted.
 The main adapter is working but has IPv4 configuration disabled. Thus logging in becomes impossible and I need to bother the Administrator.
 Windows 10 Enterprise.
 Enabling IPv4 is not allowed on the main adapter after the intel tooling created subadapter(s).

The router has Dhcp, NAT etc configured nothing major. However, what I tried recently was creating separate VRFs, one for the Customer and the second for the Management of the router. This was done to ensure to segregation of the routing tables of customer and management. 
 Now while deploying I was wondering, what are the pros and cons of creating VRFs in this scenario. What could be the possible downside of creating such a setup ? Appreciate your help and expertise, thanks in advance.

 Not really sure where else to post this. I did post this in r/networkautomation just now. 
 I've been going crazy the past few hours trying to fix this. I have a small EVE-NG environment running Cisco IOL and an Ubuntu box on my host machine. My goal is to start studying and writing Ansible playbooks for network automation.
 I CANNOT for the life of me SSH to my Cisco routers. At first it was giving me some Cipher key issues. Then a no matching host key type found. Their offer: ssh-rsa error. I uncommented a bunch of lines and added some lines in my ~/.ssh/config file as well as my /etc/ssh/ssh_config and also an sshd file I believe (I don't fully recall as I did a bunch of stuff).
 Anyways, i'm at the point now when I try to SSH, I get an error in libcrypto error. I have removed my crypto keys and regenerated them. I had to generate them with a higher length as I was getting an invalid key length. All in all, I cannot SSH to these routers and I don't know why. I'm not the most Linux savvy but I will say I have no issues SSHing from my SecureCRT client on the same host machine. And telnet is a non-issue from my linux box either. It's solely SSH
 Any help would be appreciated because i'd like to move on with my studies and this all hinges on being able to SSH from this linux host box. 
 Thanks

I doubt it will be using close to 10Gig but if that's what they are paying for I don't want the router to be a bottleneck. Was originally looking at Cisco 4461 but even "performance license" aggregate throughput is only 3Gbps and "boost license" is 7 Gbps but only between built in 1Gbps interfaces. Would like to stay with Cisco but not a deal breaker as it's for a non-profit so don't want to break the bank. Also don't need anything fancy like SD-WAN but need 4 10Gbps interfaces.
 Does anyone have any experience with Cisco C8300-2N2S-4T2X? It has 2 10Gig ports and 2 NIM and 19Gigs of IPv4 forwarding throughput if not using SD-WAN.

 I'm a System Engineer for a tech company - have a ton of experience with VMware, VDI, Storage, and Azure to a degree and automation such as Ansible and Terraform. Anyways, the company is paying for a ton of training and emersion days which, whatever the outcome at the end of this I am fully taking advantage of.
 My question are to those who have gone through similar migrations and really looking for, generally speaking, how your job transformed from on prem to cloud - and what you did to prepare for it. What are some things you wish you knew? What would you do differently? Not from a technical aspect, more from an education and toolset aspect. Are there things that would have made the transition smoother... Not going to to say "easy" bc I'm not naive.. lol.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I work as a network architect and my and my colleagues have run into something we’ve never seen before. Figured it’s time to attempt to crowdsource a solution. 
 We have a Arris E6000 running docsis 3.1 and sip with a global DQoS for the service flow. For some unknown reason whenever a call is made, immediately after the phone is hung up and the gate is closed the internet speed it throttled down to exactly 33Mbps. This last for. Early 9 minutes on the dot. It happens every single time. If the phone is left off the hook and the call is disconnected from the far end, the throttling does not occur. As soon as the receiver is hung up, the throttling occurs. 
 This happens on multiple versions of of the E6000 firmware, it happens on any modem running SIP, it happens on any speed config, it happens with a standalone sip service flow config (note the call does not use the sip service flow and instead still uses the DQoS), it happens with different modem configs. 
 It’s a head scratcher for sure.

 discovered that someone has setup all of the little MFP's to connect to google to auth and relay the email so it would land in the users mailbox. I've mentioned that it's probably not the greatest setup and that we should be relaying off of something that we use or actually pay for but it seems to be going over their heads.
 ​
 I've sorta looked around with the google TOS and can't really find too much aside from the link below, is there something else that i'm missing or am i just crying wolf?

 EDIT - I do have the solutions and proposed that we bounce it off our internal server/M365 or an external SMTP service that we use, but it's been deaf ears. I know there are bigger fish to fry than this however is there anything to be concerned about in terms of licensing/privacy/policy etc? I've already hummed and hawed about how bounching it off of a third party isn't exactly the most secure and know that it's google, they will pretty much own a copy of anything we scan, but deaf ears.

According to WaPo the leaker of secret documents was a NG technology support staffer, basically a junior sysadmin. The guy is 21 years old and probably going to spend the rest of his life in prison as a traitor. A reminder to everyone with access to secrets to not be stupid.

 My question is in which point we can send mail to abuse contact and wait for reply
 If we don't get reply from ASN, can we contact with RIR from internet governance perspective?
 I hope this is not dumb question.

 A little bit of background: I graduated in 2019 with a BS in computer science, no certifications yet, and landed my first job in IT a couple of months later in k12 education at a middle school. I was the sole IT person there, so I was in charge of everything that plugged into the wall, from desktop support, to sysadmin duties in the mdf room, to inventory/asset management. Being my first IT job, I learned so much there but after about 2 years it quickly got old and felt plateaued. Also the school district's IT department started making things more and more centralized so I started losing permissions and access. 
 Anyway, I started interviewing for mainly sysadmin jobs in late 2022…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ziply Fiber seems to be one of latest ISPs to begin selling a 10G service tier via their FTTH network. My understanding is that these guys are using XGS-PON for their access network, and if this is correct, how the heck are they able to claim to offer 10G? At best with no congestion from neighbors sharing the OLT port, an XGS-PON user should only be able to get about 8.5 Gbps in either direction due to FEC and other overhead. I can't find anything anywhere talking about Ziply starting to deploy any flavor of 25G PON or active Ethernet, so what gives? Is this just another example of a company's Marketing department having no idea what they're talking about? I'd love to hear from any Ziply engineers if you guys are lurking here, particularly about which PON platform you've deployed.
 EDIT: Mystery solved. Ziply is in fact doing active Ethernet for their 10G tier (this is the transceiver they use). Kudos to them! It's not super scalable but if they have the spare fiber strands to burn, it is the cheapest, easiest, and most performant option for getting 10G to residential customers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm working on a GPON/XGS-PON deployment. Normally, we use PLC splitters, but a manufacturer proposed an FBT splitter so we can daisy chain our taps (ie: 10% of light going to the tap splitter, with 90% of the light going to the next tap). These particular FBTs are described to work in the full 1250-1650nm range, which is unlike anything I've read, but great if it works.
 I'm worried about temperature. Everything I'm reading says FBT splitters work from -5 to 75 Celcius, where PLC's can go down to -40 Celcius operating range. The buildout is in New England, so temperatures can definitely get down to -20 celsius. Does anyone have experience with this? Should I expect insertion losses over the FBT (like an additional half db of loss) or should I expect the FBT splitter to fail completely?
 Thanks ahead of time for your help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To begin with, I'm not a networking expert, in any mean. I have noticed this weird behaviour of our router at work (we do web services and have many workstations connected in LAN):
  
We've got fiber optics connection through a modem/router installed by our ISP. We can't ask for another model, we can't use anything else (they refuse to setup anything else).
 Whenever the modem/router is hit by simultaneous connections (usually when more than 10 computers are connected), it crashes. If only one computer is connected and is hitting the modem with simultaneous connections (let's say multi-threaded download), the modem crashes.
  
The actual workaround is that if we use a VPN, which means only one connection is created from each computer, there's no crash. However, using an external VPN limits our bandwidth.
 Is there anything we can set on the network to limit the simultaneous connections? At the moment, we're out of ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been tasked with replacing our security camera NVR. We've currently got a 16 channel Hikvision unit that (while being a major step up from our old java-based D-Link DVRs) is a pain in the butt with it's requirements for proprietary video plugins and management software that demands local admin rights.
 Fortunately, we have contractual obligations with some of our customers that prevent us purchasing any additional Hikvision equipment (NDAA concerns), so our need to upgrade to a 32 channel unit gives me the perfect excuse to ditch Hikvision and our current NVR.
 Does anyone have any recommendations for an NVR that works with modern web standards, can be fully managed without specialized software (or at the very least uses software that's not stuck with Windows 98 security practices) and has basic motion-triggered recording features?
 Also, we have a number of cameras we don't want to replace just yet, so ONVIF compatibility is a must-have (though I imagine that's fairly standard at this point).
 EDIT: I have to admit, I'm a bit surprised by all the software-based recommendations. On the one-hand, it makes sense that a pure software solution would offer the best features and widest camera compatibility. On the other, I'm really disappointed at the idea that there's so few decent turn-key appliances out there.

Needless to say, we're not making out clients pay that and taking our business elsewhere.
 We liked Cerberus because it's super easy to set up and use, nice UI, and just plain works. Wanting something similar that doesn't cost a grand a year just so we can have SFTP. Not interested in any script, CLI, Linux, or open source solutions for various reasons. I've seen some mentions of CrushFTP around here, still a good option and comparable to Cerberus?

I just learned this last week when they put the task on me to figure out how to do it after Qualys reported these EOL .NET versions as vulnerabilities.
 I've looked into Microsoft's Uninstall Tool, but I'm seeing that versions that Visual Studio installed (such as .NET 3.1 SDK with Visual Studio Professional 2019) can ONLY be uninstalled through the Visual Installer to modify .NET. I've also tried looking into the WMIC command line and manually uninstalling in Programs & Apps, which both do not work for this.
 Am I at a loss or is there any actual way to remotely do what they are asking, such as with SCCM?

 We shut off POP + IMAP access to email not too long ago, to stop that "backdoor" into downloading an entire corporate mailbox onto non-corporate devices. And things have been quiet; people have had to access their mailbox via gmail.com or a Gmail app since.
 Now we have a few (mouthy) users who want their desktop client back (Apple Mail for example). Security is reopening the review into how to make it work. But, I've been through this already and want to limit the rabbit hole we go down (for the 2nd time). 
 From what I can see, I can enable/disable IMAP on a group or OU basis in Google Admin. Further, I can limit the IMAP access to specific mail clients. But that is all. I can't, in any way, limit the IMAP to corporate-owned devices, or approved devices, anything like that. And Context Aware Access does not engage for IMAP in any way that I can see. I assume it's because you're not opening the specific Workspace apps themselves, you're just authenticating to establish the OAuth token.
 Am I missing something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, i've been tasked with finding CMDB solutions that can be hosted on-prem. Apparently ServiceNow isn't an option due to cost and an excel sheet isn't an option due to lack of functionality.
 In this day and age it feels like just about every CMDB solution is cloud based (for pretty good reasons imo) so finding one that is actually on prem is like finding a needle in a haystack.
 What CMDB solutions have you guys come across in your line of work that have been on-prem hosted?

 F&Q (https://wasabi.com/paygo-pricing-faq/#free-egress-policy) says, 
  
For example, if you store 100 TB with Wasabi and download (egress) 100 TB or less within a monthly billing cycle, then your storage use case is a good fit for our policy. If your monthly downloads exceed 100 TB, then your use case is not a good fit. 
  
Suppose storing 50GB on the Pay-Go plan. I understand I'll be charged for 1TB (a minimum monthly charge associated with 1 TB of active storage). How about the egress regulation? Will I have up to 1TB egress capacity? Or, just 50GB? 
 The same question goes for another situation: storing 1.2TB and being charged for 2TB. Will be the egress capacity 2TB or 1.2TB?

 If we were doing standard just throw a new AD online, sync, then down original and replace.
 Essentials doesn't allow multiple ADs. Customer only has 15 users, doesn't use advanced services of standard, no need, never gonna have more than 20 users.
 One thought I had was run windows backup of system only stuff, place on USB drive during install. In theory it should pull system config and backup, users, etc?
 Will that work or any other ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 we're currently using AD RMS with M365 Apps for Enterprise. All is working fine but now we want to migrate to Azure RMS and thereafter to Azure Information Protection. Prior to mgirate any users, I tested with my own account and set a deny permission on the license.asmx file for my user for read and execute.
 After restarting Word, I did not see my AD RMS templates anymore, which is great because this is what I expected. But instead, it connected to Azure RMS and showed the "Restricted Access" and "Unrestricted Access" template, as well as previously configured Sensitivity Labels. I did not create a SRV record for redirection, therefore I'm also wondering why it did connect to Azure RMS.
 I reverted the permission change on the license.asmx file and included my user again to read the file. I can verify this by opening the URL in the browser. I also deleted the MSIP folder in %localdappdata% and removed everything from the registry, that points to <GUID.aadrm.com>. Office is still connecting everytime to Azure RMS instead of my internal AD RMS server. I have an existing SCP, but this seems to be ignored now and I cannot get it back working to use AD RMS.
 Any advise?

We currently have around 50 vessels that are essentially floating mini offices and each having their own network on board. We are using Peplink routers as it can use cellular network to provide internet whilst out at sea (hopefully moving to Starlink for future endeavours, but thats another story lets just say awaiting on management). 
 I just wanted to know if there is anything out there that can monitor the network for each vessel remotely in one place. I would like it mainly to monitor bandwidth usage and traffic, similar to DPI. Unfortunately, only the higher end models of Peplinks have a DPI feature which we do not use.
 Any recommendations would greatly appreciated!

He visits our work area 10 to 15 times a day. He also is behind on his projects and doesn't do much with helpdesk tickets due to other helpdesk members carrying the bulk of those tickets. Doesn't pull his weight, and it gets frustrating.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hope this is the right place to post. I have a homelab I want to implement some branding on the search highlights / search menu, which can be done using Azure AD (https://techb4.com/search-highlights-logo-customize-for-windows-10-11/).
 I wonder, since it is just the 'Search' app likely looking for files in a directory, or registry keys, can this be set by just putting the right files in the right place? I don't have an Azure AD machine to test this on or find the correct locations, however. It would be nice to create a GPO with these files so all my VMs can have consistent branding.
 Not sure how time consuming it would be to just create a new fresh vm, join it to a new free azure instance to test it myself. Like take a reg/files snapshot and then join, get the branding and take another reg/files snapshot and diff them.
 Since MS removed my option for branding (the 'System' control panel area) in the latest version of Windows I have to look for other areas!
 Anyone got any ideas, or is it just not possible without AAD?

 The latest march security update (Security Update for Microsoft SharePoint Enterprise Server 2016) is causing an issue with my IIS.
 As soon as I install it a new DLL gets added "sprequestfilteringmodule.dll" and the IIS becomes unreachable (503 error). What's interesting upon further investigation is that the WSUS Application Pool can't be started (no error message is shown, it just immediatly stopps again). The WAS Service is up and running though. In the Event Viewer, there are errors from the WAS Service with the Event ID 5002. A restart didn't help, the server had to be restored in order to get the IIS fast online again. More info to the server: It's a Windows 2012 R2 Server running SharePoint 2013 and the IIS. Has anyone encountered a similiar problem with the March Update or maybe even found a solution? Thanks already for reading and have a nice day

 I'm looking for some ideas on what to look for in regard to the below issue.
 The setup is 2 Nexus Switches with 4 vPC links going to 4 Isilon Appliances. (2 links per Appliance) Each interface on the Isilons have an IP address assigned and then the whole lot are in a cluster with Virtual IP.
 When all links are up I get packet loss to the Virtual IP. But if I shut down 1 redundant link per Isilon Appliance the packet loss goes away. 
 Has anyone seen this behaviour before? 
 MTU is set the same on both sides.

 I am in the process of removing our certificate authority server as we no longer need it.....then I remember years ago we configured AD to use LDAP over SSL. Running the LDP.exe I can connect to any DC over 636 or 389 so it makes me wonder about the overall security anyway.
 Just wondered how many of you are using LDAP without SSL? and has anyone purchased third party certificates for SSL? That might be something I can look into.

 Right now I do Windows updates and then either a Dell Command update or Lenovo Service Bridge update, but if it's possible to merge the process it saves me a good amount of time.

 I have been given the green light to implement cloud based printing in our business of around 300 users and 40 printers. I'm looking to go with Printer Logic as the print queue based licensing suits our needs better. 
 I'm just curious to know from anyone that has rolled this out what your procedure was? Currently have 2 print servers, one for each site. I want to do some initial testing first with a couple of printers before rolling out across the business. 
 We have around 10 GPOs relating to mapping printers for users (the guy before created a GPO for every different department instead of just using 1 GPO with item level targetting) Is it a matter of amending these GPOs to delete rather than create/update before pushing out the Printer Logic agent to the endpoints?
 Appreciate any advice
 Thank you

 In january there was a update that should have fixed this: https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/january-26-2023-kb5022360-os-build-22621-1194-preview-f6973dbe-bcc4-402a-8b9a-0541b0959403
 Unfortunatly this problem keeps coming back every month or so and im getting frustrated with the ammount of time me and my team have put in these work arrounds.
 The update is installed on all our customers computers but the problem came back today after a new update. 
 ​
 Does anyone here have a better way to deal with this problem than to manualy rename the MSTSCAX.DLL files and replacing them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Fellas :)
 I hope this is the correct flair, I was unsure if I should choose "Question" or "Microsoft"?
 I am currently having a problem with Microsoft Teams at one of our customers. It is a medium-sized company with about 30 employees.
 All employees work on a Windows Server 2019 terminal server and have a Microsoft 365 Business Basic license. Teams has the latest updates.
 At the beginning of the Corona Pandemic, the Teams-Free licenses were rolled out as a test. Everything has now been migrated to Microsoft 365 and the users have full licenses that also include the use of teams.
 Now the problem, which affects a part of the users, about a third: Teams ALWAYS logs in with the old "Free" account and does not recognize the assigned license. Logging out and back in manually doesn't help either. In the free account, an old database is listed up to the end of 2020, everything after that (since using the O365 licenses) seems to be in a kind of different profile that is not loaded.
 I have already reinstalled Teams, assigned / withdrawn the Teams Exploratory license from all users as a test and deleted the Teams cache under %appdata%/Microsoft/Teams.
 If the user logs into Teams via office.com, everything works as it should and the correct content and chats are displayed, the problem ONLY affects the local client.
 Do you have any idea? Some Teams-related things are just out of my understandings... Thanks!

I've also seen in their network infrastructure diagrams that they are also (but not only) running several 2650 and 2810 switches. It's not the focus of their request, but it got my attention.
 I've quickly checked their end of sale (both: 10y+) and the last time HPE/Aruba ever released software updates for the se switches (> 5y for one of them). These switches have Lifetime warranty and the clients' sysadmins is aware of that. In my experience HPE was also pretty OK with replacing defective units without much fuss. Yet without knowing the exact year they got purchased these 2 indicators would tell me that these switches are likely to have high runtime and should (really) be considered for replacement.
 While I've worked with HPE/Aruba switches it's not my daily business anymore (more in the system engineering field these days) thus I'm asking for an opinion.

 Usually I would not expose a database on the internet. I don't like that. It feels wrong to me.
 Am I too picky?
 What is the todays standard, to allow access to such a database?
 I have grafana running on the cluster. I could add a datasource and then the dude can build his panels and see the data. With 2fa, roles and permissions... but no Idea if I am thinking to complex.

 I am tasked with installing wifi in two buildings that are connected to the MDF via singlemode 9/125um fiber. The wifi will be broadcasting a public and private SSID on separate VLANs.
 Will any generic 9/125um SM LC SFP modules work with the indicated switch models, or are there compatibility issues among suppliers? Also do you foresee any VLAN tagging issues with this layout? I know I can do all this with fiber media converters and non-SFP switches, but I wanted to kill two birds with one stone, and cut out the converters and extra points of failure. Total length of both buildings together is approx 700ft.
 Note: there may be a MDF-IDF2 fiber run, but I won't know for sure until I talk to the cabler. The MDF fiber panels aren't labeled, so I didn't include the 2nd MDF fiber panel in the diagram. But if the MDF-IDF2 fiber run does exist, the design won't change much. Instead the 2nd SFP module will move to the MDF switch.

 How can I set up SNMP to safely hit our network on the Public router to hit Cisco Prime? Does it involve our firewall? ACL, SNMPv3, static route?? Currently, I am unable to reach my Cisco Prime server and other internal networks from that router (public).
 What do you think the best practice is? 
 The purpose is to monitor the device and BGP session (downlink, device down, etc.) using Cisco Prime. 
 I can ping the router's public IP from the inside, but pinging from the public router to internal networks is a no-go.

 - Arris Touchstone CM8200 Modem
 - Netgear Router R6120
 - SonicWall TZ370 NGFW
 - REOLINK NVR
 - Computers
 Current set-up is Modem > Router (handles DHCP & is default gateway) > NVR, Computers. I want to keep the router in here for Wi-Fi capability.
 Here is a picture of how I want to set this up: https://imgur.com/a/cRCLA8p "Modem > NGFW (X1 WAN port), NGFW (X3 port) > Router (Internet Port), Router (Ethernet Ports) > NVR, Computers" but when I seemingly plug it in, the end devices don't have internet.
 I'm wondering if I have to flush the IP addresses of all devices and set the default gateway to the NGFW? If so, how do I do that? If its easier, could I still let the router handle DHCP and give the NGFW an IP?
 Also the default IP for the X0 LAN port on the NGFW is 192.168.168.168. The IP range from the router is the usual 192.168.1.1-.254. In order to access the NGFW, do I have to set the X0 LAN port to something inside the router's range?
 Thanks for any and all help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Got another fun one!
 So imagine you have an on prem AD, contoso.local, that doesn't really do much outside of PC login auth but you're quite attached to it. Then imagine you also have M365 in parallel, as contoso.com and it is in use for keeping track of M365 licenses, which is no biggie, but also for auth for some third party services, which becomes a massive PITA if it breaks. 
 Now picture a world where you want the two to work together. Now, if someone who gets paid a lot more than me hadn't gone in and just manually created accounts for everyone in 365 and had instead used aad connect it'd be pretty simple and my life would be easier. But that was not to be. I can't just do the needful, make a new upn suffix and have sync magically just work. 
 Can I map existing on prem AD users to 365 users with aadsync? And the PCs too, I guess, although while they[re there they're not really there, y'know? Ultimately, we're wanting to keep a couple AD servers on prem because it is just so dang easy to use (especially as an auth provider for a lot of internal stuff) but because everyone else is using cloud then we are too. Has anyone easily married the two without too much disruption (or work, because who wants to do more than they absolutely need to?)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company has a consultant who will be working remotely and in our office to review our sensitive company data at the request of our board of directors. My CFO asked that I connect and allow this person's computer to our corporate network, both in the office and for remote VPN work. I refused saying that was a tremendously bad idea of putting the company network at risk. I followed up saying we have plenty of spare laptops and I can issue him one in less than a few minutes, he dismissed this idea saying that this new IT stance was overreaching and controlling the business in ways he did not agree with.
 I've been in it for 22 years, I recognize that when I started a request like this would not have been given a second thought, however, with the way things are these days I only allow company managed computers to connect to our internal network. I've explained to the CFO that we have other consultants working for us who either have their own issued computers, or, are using cloud services to upload their work so that internal employees can review and save it as needed. His only argument for allowing a computer we do not manage to connect directly to our internal network is that it would be faster and more efficient for this consultant to do his work. My rebuttal is that while it is faster for him to do all of his work on a single computer it raises our risk by an incalculable amount that I do not think is worth considering.
 While I feel fairly secure in my response, and I have not relented one bit, his over the top response to this has me wondering what other professionals in the field feel about this situation.
 Thoughts? Am I the a-hole?

This past month marks my 1yr and just had my review and was told i would get a raise as my performance was great. Fast forward to this month i was informed the company is cutting cost spent to much money in start up phase! And i would need to hold off. This is 2nd time to hold off. Said raise was supposed to have came at 6mths then again at a yr. No raise.
 Boss Today asked how we can save money and cut cost for company and IT dept.

 When i try to use 802.1x on a managed aruba switch thats connected to the access layer none of the port access requests make it to the clearpass server, i know radius is working because i can login to the switch with my radius credentials and my changes are showing up in clearpass.
 The port that the downstream switch is connected to does not have port access enabled, its just a regular port with all VLANs tagged as i would configure any normal trunk between 2 switches.
 Am i missing something here? can 802.1x wired authentication work across multiple switches?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Over the years, I've gone through various laptop docking station setups and it's been a frustrating experience. My Dell E6410 worked reliably with a proprietary dock, but my Dell XPS 13 with a Thunderbolt dock had endless issues with detection. Even after multiple driver downloads and fresh Windows installs, problems persisted with sound and monitor detection.
 I then switched to an HP EliteBook X360 with a USB C dock, which worked well until I hit limitations with monitor resolution. I replaced that with a Startech Thunderbolt 3 dock, which generally worked fine but occasionally required unplugging and replugging after sleep mode.
 Now, with my Lenovo ThinkPad P1 Gen 5, I use a ThinkPad Thunderbolt 4 dock for Workstations. While I can remove my laptop from the dock without issue, returning it to the dock requires a hard reboot. And when the laptop goes to sleep, waking it up is often hit or miss, with only one screen coming up or no keyboard function.
 It's frustrating to deal with these issues, and I know I'm not alone - I constantly hear from my users with similar problems on their devices, including Microsoft Surface Laptops with both Surface Docks and universal docks. It's been over half a decade since USB C docks became the standard and there seems to be little improvement from manufacturers. Are the engineers at the manufacturers as frustrated as we are?
 All of my experiences have been with Win10 or 11, perhaps Microsoft is to blame.

 How are you handling these issues?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, I'm new here.
 Our story begins with a switch stack, we'll call it switch 3. Switch 3 has been communicating with another switch called switch 50.
 Switch 3 and Switch 50 are using APs to talk to each other.
 switch 3 is configured as follows:
 interface TenGigabitEthernet2/0/47
 switchport trunk native vlan 10
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,10,100
 switchport mode trunk
 end
 and switch 50 is configured as follows:
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1
 switchport trunk native vlan 10
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 1,10,100
 switchport mode trunk
 ip dhcp snooping trust
 end
 interface Vlan1
 ip address 172.X.X.Z *netmask*
 !
 interface Vlan10
 ip address 10.X.X.Y *netmask*
 the meat of the story is that things in the IP subnet of VLAN 10 can communicate back and forth between the network. an example would be switch 3 pinging an IP in the VLAN 10 range (10.X.X.Y) that lives on switch 50. But when I try to ping an IP in the VLAN 1 range (Yes, I know, I inherited this network) there is no response. I will provide an example below:
 SW-003#ping 10.X.X.Y
 Type escape sequence to abort.
 Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 10.X.X.Y, timeout is 2 seconds:
 .!!!!
 Success rate is 80 percent (4/5), round-trip min/avg/max = 2/21/43 ms
 but when I ping switch 50 using the VLAN 1 range it shows below
 SW-003#ping 172.X.X.Z
 Type escape sequence to abort.
 Sending 5, 100-byte ICMP Echos to 172.X.X.Z, timeout is 2 seconds:
 .....
 Success rate is 0 percent (0/5)
 I know this is a whole bunch of Cisco, but I'm unsure if this is a Ruckus AP\WiFi issue or if I am missing a crucial bit of configuration on the Cisco side.

 I am re-posting this in other subreddits for visibility and insight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is likely a trivial issue that I'm just not understanding... Please bear with me as I am not an expert in networking.
 I have a Synology 802.11ac router with roughly 60 devices connected. Guest network is turned on.
 About a month ago, devices in the main network started to not have internet connection unless I assigned a static IP. I don't understand why but this has just been the case. Almost every device in the warehouse is now on a static IP. The guest network however is able to assign an IP naturally and the devices work without static IPs with no issue.
 That all being said, I have an alarm.com svr and cameras that I had to connect to the guest network to get them functioning at all which is not what I want. The svr is plugged in via ethernet (it has to be) which tries to connect it to the main network. I cannot assign an IP to the svr in the app which leaves me with a dead camera system since it cant connect to the internet.
 I'm kind of just stuck and would like to figure out how I can get the main network DHCP server to assign good IPs again and get my camera system working.
 Thank you in advance to anyone who can help me solve this!!!

 I know that the wol itself is a broadcast packet and the goal is if someone is VPN ing from outside then they should be able to login to the PCs even if they are turned off.
 I found this online is this something that can be done or am I looking at the wrong thing here? It's from 2011.
 https://www.ciscozine.com/wake-on-lan-through-internet/
 They are using a router here but instead of the router can this be done on the access switch(the static arp entry)?
 Otherwise this is the traffic flow for VPN traffic from outside
 Outside (from users PC from home or wherever) - outside ASR router - Palo firewall - nexus 7k - access switch - then the desktops

 ​
 We use Cacti to monitor most stuff on our network but I am not sure how to monitor BGP route changes. Like how do I know if the internet switched from primary to secondary isp.
 We use uptime robot to monitor network from outside because it pings the ISP IPs. But is there is a better way than to just ping the interface? When I google all I see is products that sells monitoring. If you can point me to any resources that would be great!
 ​
 Thanks! 
 EDIT: Wow yall. These are some excellent ideas.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I got an interesting one here. We have a server (server A) on our LAN that is just slowwww as hell to connect to. About 5 mins before the page loads. On the same subnet I have other servers that are not slow. All computers in the domain, static IP or Dynamic, regardless of vlan, have issues connecting to server A. If I check the switches and router, we're running at about 5% utilization. Internet speeds are at gig. Someone from the company came out and said, "the issue is on your dhcp network". So I'm thinking, that doesn't make sense, it's the same network. If he couldn't pick up an IP I'd see that as a problem with DHCP for sure, but once he's got one, not sure it matters. He insist when he sets his laptop to a static IP, it works fine, but when on DHCP, no luck. His static settings match what our DHCP hands out (subnet mask, dns, gateway, etc.) Any thoughts on why only this computer, not on our domain, would connect when on static and not DHCP.

 I've been trying to setup Oxidized as a replacement for our old RANCID configuration and was wondering how this would work with Aruba switches and PFSense firewalls.
 I know oxidized works with the older HP Procurves but I can't find any examples of it working with Aruba. I know that there is a model: procurve tag for oxidized but would that be the same for Aruba?
 Also, if anyone has gotten this to work with PFSense and would be willing to share their config and router.db file, I would appreciate it greatly.
 Thanks

 There's no way one can just put the archive online while continuing to create files on paper. So I told the President we needed software that provided all the functions for the relevant departments, and managed to find an open-source and well supported software for that.
 I presented it to the relevant sectors of the company and they basically didn't like it, saying it would be "too difficult" to adjust to using it. I tried again, and they said the application sucks without even so much as touching it. Talked to the President and he insisted we must use it. Scheduled training this morning, no one showed up.
 I'm not sure what these people want to be honest. No way I'm going to be responsible for operating the software too, it's not even my function, I just provided them the software. They dead-on said they didn't like it and want to go back to the way it was before, i.e. doing everything on paper. I even mentioned a search in the archive can be done in less than a minute now thanks to the software and they couldn't be pissed.
 How do you guys manage to convince coworkers? Or should I just say fuck it and let them have it their way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can anyone confirm how thousandeyes pricing model works? Cisco seems to be clueless. 
 Say if we have 100 branch offices or remote sites. At each branch office, we have a core router/firewall, core switch, lots of poe switches, and access points. My understanding is we would need 1 enterprise agent at each site to monitor these network devices at the site via SNMP. Do they charge per each Enterprise Agent, or per each network device (router, switch, ap) monitored? They call these network devices Device-Layer Devices https://docs.thousandeyes.com/product-documentation/device-layer/discovering-device-layer-devices
 We would then have probably one employee at each site that would have the endpoint agent installed on their laptop. We would like to run bandwidth speed test, confirm dns and basic internet connectivity is working to all cloud applications hosted on the internet. I would hope it would take into account the wifi connectivity from the laptop to the ap, the connectivity from the ap to switch, switch to router, router to ISP, and ISP to cloud application? How is this priced?
 Are we looking at 100 enterprise agents and 100 endpoint agents? 
 Can Thousandeyes replace a traditional NMS for SNMP polling and up/down ICMP pinging? Does it provide netflow, syslog ingestion, and BGP monitoring?

We bought the StarTech.com Serial DB9 RS232 Extender extender (part RS232EXTC1), which has female serial connections on both adapters. We used the gender changer adapter that came with it in order to connect the blue Cisco serial console cable to the powered adapter.
 We're not able to connect to the switch via serial, even with both adapters powered. I'm wondering if anyone has done this before, and if serial extenders are compatible with Cisco switches.
 Perhaps the powered adapters aren't necessary, perhaps the gender changer is a null modem, or perhaps the switch isn't compatible with serial extenders. I'm hoping that someone smarter than us knows a simpler way to do this (it must remain serial and cannot be network/IP-based management). Our Internet searches are not coming up with much.

 Weird one and wondered if anyone else has seen this.
 Ive got a guest wifi SSID which is VLAN’d out and has ACLs blocking local intervlan routing to keep it out the LAN.
 Everything else on the wifi seems to work but Whatsapp doesn’t connect. Its not really a big problem as i think im the only one using it once a week. But im sure someone will complain eventually. 
 Any ideas my current thought is maybe whatsapp has an IPV6 requirement now but not sure.

 Windows 10
 In December 2021 configuring VPN through configuration profiles would break the Intune Management Extension on Windows 10. The result is very hard to notice, but it causes some of the following
  
Delayed deployment of certain configuration settings
 Certain profiles reporting "successfull" but not configuring all of the settings correctly
 Certain profiles not reaching the device at all
  
If you configured the VPN directly through OMA-URI and uploaded the XML file, it would work as intended, but there are still certain issues

I'm able to generate a keypair and disable the password authentication, but what's the best way to migrate these keys to new servers? The info I've read is misleading and changes with each article. 
 Mainly, I want to create a keypair for a single developer. Any server he/she needs access to, I can add their account and public key file to the server. No creds to share or store. Easy to do for one server, but what if I am setting up multiple servers for this developer? I'm dreading the thought of having keypairs per account per server.

 We use Edge as the default browser across our org of <1000 machines and have a number of Policies set in Group Policy to standardize the experience. Nothing too crazy, just some default favorites, setting the new tab page, and a few others.
 The issue is that we've found a large and seemingly random amount of computers aren't applying ALL the policies. Most will apply. If you check the registry, every policy key is there. But Edge doesn't show them under Edge://Policy
 It doesn't matter the version of Edge, updating makes no difference. OS version makes no difference. The ADMX templates are updated as of yesterday. The machines affected are seemingly random.
 The policies were set in our Default Domain Policy (I didn't love using that), so I copied every setting and placed in a new GPO and applied to just the computers OU. Confirmed with GPOresult -r they are receiving it (and the registry keys are there under HKLM/Software/Policies/Microsoft/Edge) No change. 
 What is so weird is MOST of the policies show up in Edge, with only a few totally missing. But even some that are listed in Edge, are not actually working. Like the Home Page URL. How could that just not work?
 Has anyone encountered this before? It is making me feel crazy.

 Are there alternative methods to protect the private keys on an always running Windows Enterprise CA such as just locking down access to it in a certain way that allows it to function issuing certificates for autoenrollment to users and devices, but still keeping the private key protected from compromise.
 If it was a physical server, we might use a YubiHSM 2 plugged into a USB slot, but I don’t know that’s practical to use on an EC2 via their connector. People were discouraging it in this 2019 thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/yubikey/comments/brcnqw/is_it_possible_to_use_yubihsm_2_with_an_aws_ec2/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 ​
 I'm not sure if I'm in the right sub, if not, sorry :)
 ​
 I work at a MSP which offers IaaS and SaaS services.
 Currently we are on a pure Juniper infrastructure in terms of firewall and switches. 
 However, after certain devices go EOL and the maintenance renewal is pending for others, we are asking ourselves whether Juniper is still the right choice, since the maintenance fees alone are very high.
 ​
 To give a bit of an idea of what size range we are in:
 2 hardware firewalls:
 - Mainly L4 Statefull firewall for 12 security zones with a total of about 100 VLANs as gateway.
 - 10 Site2Site VPNs
 ​
 6 switches with the following connections (not counting uplinks)
 56 x 10 GBe
 44 x 1GBe
 20x 40GBe
 6 x 100GBe
 ​
 So not a lot, but a bit of something, which is probably what we are counting with most manufacturers in the campus segment.
 ​
 We are currently considering FortiGate for the firewall and Mellanox for the switches. At the same time, I came across FortiSwitches, which I have no experience with. Does anyone have a comparable setup and recommendations regarding function and economy?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I work at a place where all our internal tools are installed in an old (but not so bad) way. The typical infra for an app is two servers with redundancy (keepalived, HeartBeat...).
 This means one tool = at least 2 servers + some networking and one small team for maintenance (often 1-3 people). 
 For the context, we don't do cloud providers (sensitive data) and we don't have to handle a lot of traffic load (internal tools only).
 When I arrived I suggested to "centralize" this as more and more apps were also shipped containerized. So with my team we set up a Kubernetes infra which work very well, and with few servers we are able to host like 10 internal tools.
 My points are : this brings same maintenance for all the apps (common k8s dashboard, procedures...), same backups and disaster recovery system, better security management etc. (I won't teach you all of this I think ^^) 
 But the thing is : before all of this, there was very few service interruptions, and when it happened it had impact on one tools only. The k8s infra is simpler and more powerful, we had no interruption in one year. Last week, we had a stupid issue with a certificate in the CNI that interrupted all the cluster for one day (the k8s expert were not on site this day). 
 This event created a bit of a debate about migrating legacy apps to k8s, am I still on the right path ? How to reassure the old sysadmins ? I'm still thinking that k8s simplifies a lot our work

Switches send dot1x to Clearpass RADIUS which in turn returns a secure vlan tag for the switch. No certificate means the device either get some other know device category or rejected into a guest vlan. Easy.
 Same goes for wireless: workstation sends it's certificate towards SSID secure-ad-xyz, which authenticates towards Clearpass as RADIUS. Clearpass only sets access allowed/denied.
 So a seperate SSID per purpose. My question: can Aerohive APs/SSID's broadcast dynamic vlans on 1 SSID...? Depending the presented certificate a certain vlan tag? 
 Defining a RADIUS server is easy enough and obvious to find. But I cannot seem to find any documentation on AAA or dot1x portcontrol or how to setup dynamic/<any NAC>/Clearpass-returned tunnel-private-group-id ..?

 I am setting up my first ERSPAN configs on my nexus 9k switches. I need 2 separate monitors each sent via a different I address. I followed along with a guide and came up with the following for the first:
 NX-01(config)# monitor session 10 type erspan-source
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# erspan-id 20
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# vrf default
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# destination ip 2.2.2.2
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# source interface ethernet e1/2 both
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# no shut
 NX-01(config-erspan-src)# exit
 NX-01(config)# monitor erspan origin ip-address 1.1.1.1 global
 Then on the second I have a different destination ip and different source interface obviously, but I want that monitor to out via 1.1.2.1 and I am guessing the "global" command i used above makes all ERSPAN go out the 1.1.1.1 address? How would I change it so that "erpsan-id 20" goes out 1.1.1.1 and "erspan-id 30" goes out 1.1.2.1?
 Thanks!

 They now want the ability to send email as one of their service accounts. What would be the best practice for this? 
 Would it be to add a delegate msgraph "mail.send" so if the service account is using the app registration with the client secret, it can send mail on its own behalf?
 ​
 Or do I have to do it by some other means, like adding the mail.send as application policy and restrict the app registration to that one service account via mail enabled security group

 Currently got an issue and which I’m unable to find a solution to myself. Was hoping some one here could point me in the right direction.. 
 We got a customer with a tenant that is being shared between 15 different companies. One of these companies want to add an enterprise application. The application requires the roles “Reports Reader” and “Cloud application administrator”. Currently trying to investigate if it is possible to restrict the scope of permissions for these roles for the application. The other companies are worried about the “Reports Reader” role since this role can access sensitive data from the other companies as well. 
 Is there anyway to install this enterprise application in the tenant without giving the app permission to read the other companies “sign-in data” and other sensitive information?

 We could potentially hide the shortcut, but that would be updated with every update so would be a never ending fight,

 But this feauture is keeping me really busy these days.
 People lost their signatures. wel they are not lost but they are under the catagory "signatures on this computer" and can't be applied automatically to the newly writen or reply mails. 
 So that sucks, cause a lot of people have more than 1 account signed in their outlook using the same signature.
 When i uncheck the box for cloud save, it still synced signatures from other personel that are using the same mail adresses. 
 Is it just me or is this feauture not thought through properly? 
 Why not make the local signatues also available for being assigned automatically? 
 Does anyone has a faster solution other then copying the signatures again to every mail adres the customer uses?
 Like how to disable this entirely before a sync even happens?

 Some of our customers want to test our software before installing it in their productive environment, since it's rather complicated to install and needs a server.
 We'd like to provide virtual machines to our customers with our software on there for them to test.
 Does anyone have experience setting up something like this?
 My current plan is to get a somewhat decent PC to act as a Server for virtualization since server hardware is super pricey.
 Then I'd either get a Windows Server License and create Virtual Machines for each customer using HyperV
 OR
 I would install Proxmox and buy multiple Win10 Pro licenses to create a virtual machine for every customer. 
 Are there better ways for that? Is it even allowed to provide our customer with a fully installed Windows 10 Pro with our software on it?
 Cloud (AWS, Azure etc.) is unfortunately not an option.
 I feel like there are better ways for doing what I have planned.

 Looking to get some input from the hive mind...
 MSA 1050 with SAS connection to 2 Hyper-V nodes. Inherited the current configuration with 6 1.8TB SAS disks in RAID 6. this should theoretically give me around 7.2TB of useable storage.
 Additional array of 4 x 2.4TB disks installed in RAID 5 again theoretical useable of 7.2 TB.
 All that's working as expected the disk groups state size as 7192 GB in both instances, however, in windows after mapping the volumes they're showing as 6.54 TB in both instances.
 The first array (RAID 6 1.8TB disks) is nearly full hence installing new array to archive some data off, however, looking at the SAN management interface there's apparently a TB of unallocated storage. Pool B has nothing moved onto it yet so I assume that's why it's reporting as virtually empty.
 I've read through the supporting documentation and followed to the letter with creating the disk group and volume. I haven't been able to find anyone else with this problem, which makes me think it's just the way it is, but seems odd.
 Has anyone come across this before? I'm not overly familiar with HP SANs or SAS connections to them.
 Thanks in advance!

 There is a lot of documentation available, but it's quite verbose and I can imagine that it is hard for someone new to find specific information without a lot of reading.

Intune is mostly satisfactory for our requirements. However, we like to run arbitrary Powershell scripts from time to time for various tasks. The problem is that the script deployment component of intune is very poor (ie horribly slow and unreliable). Is there a simple product on the market that has an agent that we cand deploy scripts to? Im not looking for a tool with a million other features we dont need. Im hoping there is something lightweight and secure that does few other things other than remote script deployment/management. Its a bit hard wading through the 'bells and whistles' products. TIA.

 Currently I work at a MSP as networking/infrastructure engineer and I'm getting to the point of burnt out. Currently my MSP supports small business and 99% of our clients run horrible EOL devices that have countless security issues and lists of other issues. Sadly my MSP is undergoing changes from a buyout and other issues, so our focus is currently on just band aid fixing 99% of these platforms and not properly upgrading or find long term solutions. This is only the start of the list of things wrong with my MSP, I've come to the conclusion I'll officially be moving on. I used to work for the CA government and while it was not perfect by had a lot of advantages compared to my current position.
 I wanted to get feedback from everyone on the best types of companies to work for. I understand there are great fortune 500 companies like Netflix, Linkedin etc. However I wanted to see if anyone had from personal experience a field that generally has a good IT backbone. For example I've been looking into banks or hospitals since both will more then likely have a huge security presence and more then likely a proper set of policies and procedures.

 and
 2023-04 Kumulatives Update für Windows 11 Version 22H2 für x64-basierte Systeme (KB5025239)
 If the second one is for 22H2, what is the first one for?
 Also, what are the "Windows 11, version 22H2 x64 2023-04B" ones? They are classified as "upgrades"
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys!
 I have been trying to get iDRAC up and running recently, but it has been driving me crazy and would love a little help if any one could!
 ​
 A bit of background:
 I have have an old Dell PowerEdge C2100 I have had for a little over two years. I have never updated the BIOS or iDRAC firmware since I have had it, as I thought that they were probably close to latest possible version being as old as it is. I now have run into an issue with iDRAC as it has become so old no web browser (even internet explorer) wants to interact with it with the exception of my IOS devices (I assume safari is very leanient on older TLS protocols when accepting the risk of an invalid cert). After some research I found a reddit post (I can't find it but if I do i'll link it here) about how they bricked theirs by not first updating to 1.65.66 and now iDRAC doesn't work anymore. I then stumble across another couple posts mentioning that there are at least 4-5 stepped firmware upgrades you must do in order but no one mentions them. I have searched through Dell's site for a couple days now and can only find BIOS firmware and some client exes on the official Dell PowerEdge C2100 downloads page.
 ​
 I guess my questions are, where can I find resources on what major versions I must update to and where can I find the update files for iDRAC? I have heard of a bootable Update ISO that helps get the required updates from the Dell Repository, is that supported for C2100s (I can't find any trace of it).
 ​
 I really appreciate any help, thanks guys!

 There are 8 users. It's only used as a file share. The files are office files but also lots of blue prints (PDF) which can sometimes be as large as 10MB.
 I'd like to go RAID5.
 Would there be a significant benefit on going with the Synology SSDs over the Seagate IronWolf HDDs?
 We don't need much storage. 2TB would be ok. But the difference between buying 3 HDD or 3 SSD is around $700. 
 Files are accessed over the network, on a 1 Gbps speed.
 Thanks for any advice!

 I am using DMVPN solution on Cisco IOS XE devices.
 The IPSec tunnels created are protected using CA certificates.
 Now I noticed that the IPSec tunnels will stay up even if I deleted the certificate , and the tunnels will not go down except if I disabled and enabled it again (Probably because the IKE is reinitiated).
 Is there anyway to force IPSec for routine Certificate checking , so that in case the CA certificates at the client is revoked, deleted or expired for some reason , the IPSec tunnel will go down ?.
 Let me know what do you think.
 Thanks in advance.

 So last week we changed the domain we were using as a vpn endpoint… was a red tape thing after being acquired… We were told to add “vpn.domain.com” to our existing domain… Anyways the change went well… or so we thought.
 About 12 hours after the change about 90% of people could connect… Of the 10% that couldn’t we realized they ALL had Spectrum at home. No one had issues with Comcast or ATT.
 Now, we have two guys on a business trip to do some maintenance on our servers at an out of state colo. They too are also unable to connect and are receiving the same error message “Cant connect to the specified secure gateway.”
 My manager says its because we don’t have ‘DMARC’ set up for this new domain… Everything I’ve read on DMARC seems highly specific to email so I’m very confused how this would be relevant…
 Without going down a rabbit hole – does anything jump out here that I should check? Not trying to waste anyones time… just curious if this is something obvious that I’m oblivious to.

Thankfully the message and its Trojan PDF was blocked by MS Defender as Trojan_PDF_QakAdobeLureZip_A.
 I have seen a few of these, including one thread that was stolen from a major corporation that had nothing to do with us (probably a mistake in the phishing scripts).
 Is the consensus that these were mined from phishing victims who gave out their email credentials and then the bad actors put a forwarding rule to capture the emails?
 How might you go about informing the original sender whose email I believe was hacked? I feel a sort of duty to do so, but these emails were from seven months ago. Any evidence might be long gone.

I'm going to preface this post by saying I have never had hands-on experience with an Enterprise MPLS network or the process of ordering such a service. That being the case, there is a ton of information out there about MPLS and how it works, how you configure it within devices, etc. But one thing I can't seem to find is any information about the underlying Layer-1 transport for MPLS. I'm aware that MPLS doesn't really care if it travels across UTP cables or Optical links but what I'm wondering is this; For those of you who have actually installed MPLS circuits what type of Layer-1 connectivity have you used? If optical, what kind of optical (DWDM? Something else?) and how was that optical fiber provided to your company? If copper, did it use RJ45 connectors? Something else? Just trying to get a feel for how MPLS is physically provided to a company. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An update to my previous post.
 My account rep has responded with the same stats that were linked in that thread. 
 Here is what was sent to me:
  
Regarding the presence of Fortinet Fortigate VPN our recommendation remains the same to explore ZTNA solutions. Cisco, llumio, Palo Alto, ZScaler, and Perimeter81 are some ZTNA options we recommend. 
 Using incident data and internal "insert insurance company name" claims data, we identify the propensity of cyber incidents based on company size (revenue), industry, and VPN Solution in place. An interesting stat that came out of our analysis was organizations using this VPN solution (Fortinet Fortigate) are 3x more likely to have a security incident. In other words, "insert insurance company name" predictive risk model has observed more instances of ransomware attacks at organizations utilizing this VPN solution. 
  
We are having internal talks now to decide what to do, but moving providers is one of them. I understand that ZTNA is better, but what I perceive as our threat model doesn't warrant me going that far.
 If anyone has thoughts or ideas of what to do, I will gladly take them into consideration.

 Does anyone know if the Remote ID Adapters tests for wire pair mismatch like the Wiremap Adpater or is it strictly for ID'ing the ports? Can't find it explicitly stating so, so I'm guessing not but hoping someone who as the Remote ID Adapters can verify.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A major focus of my daily work at Microsoft over the last year has been designing, building, testing, and documenting the new Windows Local Administrator Password Solution (aka “LAPS”). Many of our customers are using and are very familiar with the older product known as Microsoft LAPS. I am very happy to say that we are delivering today a worthy (IMO) successor in Windows LAPS. Please see By popular demand: Windows LAPS available now! for more details.
 Teaser: many of you are eagerly awaiting the public preview announcement for the Azure Active Directory scenario – we’re not quite there - sorry - but it will be coming this quarter! 
 So how do you get the bits? Feel free to just run Windows Update of course, however the following doc topic will be updated later today with links to the specific KB update articles:
 Windows LAPS supported platforms and Azure AD LAPS preview status
 And for those that are might ask: yes the feature bits are available on Windows 10 today as well! :-)
 thanks,
 Jay Simmons

 This should be of interest to many here: 
 "Welcome to the new and improved Windows LAPS! That's Local Administrator Password Solution. We've been listening to your feedback and requests, and the day is finally here for both cloud and on-premises environments.
 We're very happy to announce that new LAPS capabilities are coming directly to your devices starting with today's April 11, 2023 security update for the following Windows editions:
  
Windows 11 Pro, EDU, and Enterprise
 
Windows 10 Pro, EDU, and Enterprise
 
Windows Server 2022 and Windows Server Core 2022
 
Windows Server 2019 "
 
 https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/by-popular-demand-windows-laps-available-now/ba-p/3788747
 There are some cool new features for on-prem though
  
Password encryption: Greatly improves security for these sensitive secrets!
 
Password history: Gives you the ability to log back into restored backup images.
 
Directory Services Restore Mode (DSRM) password backups: Helps keep your domain controllers secure by rotating these critical recovery passwords on a regular basis!
 
Emulation mode: Useful if you want to continue using the older LAPS policy settings and tools while preparing to migrate to the new features!
 
Automatic rotation: Automatically rotate the password after the account is used.

From what I can tell so far, the PowerShell script makes a legit-looking Windows message box pop up on your screen, telling you to call a toll-free number. Dial the number and you are cheerfully greeted by a foreign call center that will be more than happy to help you resolve all your issues. You know how it works from there ...
 All jokes aside about logmein - the fact that this URL has been around for about 10 years and organically pops up in Google search is disturbing.
 Who the hell would type a dash in the URL? No one. That's not how they get you. Because the address bar in your browser is also a search box, many people tend to type in the name of a website, and then click on the website URL in the search results. (Call it lazy or dumb or genius, but I can't tell you how many times I watch people type 'youtube' and press Enter, only to then click on youtube.com in the search results). So when you type 'log me in 123' into the browser bar and press enter, you'll see this malicious site prominently displayed on the FIRST PAGE of google.

 The whole point is for redundancy and failover within the SD-WAN option. (Fortinet)
 Can't simply null the route as we're NAT'ing addresses and servers behind it. (First suggestion for us.)
 Asking here instead of the vendor subnet as I feel there's a large breath of know how.

I would just want something where I can select my intended use (home, enterprise, etc.), the number of ports, the features I need (PoE, VLAN, etc.), and it would suggest me be the best pick. At the very least, having a usable filter to reduce the sample size would be much more intuitive.

 Any idea if radius user attributes have changed? After upgrade my Vasco account was using network operator and was using network admin before.
 I can create read and write access group profile for network operator but I have feeling user profile attributes have changed so I need to really make the change at the radius server.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all. I work for a public library, and we've got issues with our staff printer. It's connected to our network, so all of us on the staff wifi connection are able to print to it. The printer is a Toshiba eStudio3015ac, if that helps.
 ​
 The problem we're encountering is randomly, sometimes a couple times a day, sometimes weeks apart, we'll get a random print job come through that none of us sent. It'll be 100+ pages with random letters/numbers/symbols on the first page, tons of blank pages, then a random symbol/letter/number on a page.
 ​
 Our network security company wants us to call them when a print happens so they can check the packet (I'm thinking is what they said? I'm a tech guy but networking-wise I'm clueless) and see where it's coming from. Our copy company is stumped as to what's causing it--they thought it was a faulty print driver, but we've replaced them on all staff laptops and it's still causing issues.
 ​
 We've downloaded Wireshark to try and monitor the traffic, but I'm having no luck figuring out how, exactly, to monitor incoming prints on the network printer. Any ideas?

We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month's updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft's Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft's updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work.
 Test, test, and test!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there,
 Looking for some recommendations for setting up a wireless bridge between a building and a field press box. Line of sight is clear and shy of 100m. Unfortunately trenching is not an option.
 I have a couple of NanoStation M2 however, the needs will include video streaming and spectator wifi. Goal is is to add a small switch in the press box and an outdoor AP in the stands. Afraid the NanoStations would not be sufficient.
 Was looking ideally at something that would work in the 60ghz with 5ghz failover and could give me approx gigabit duplex.
 Found MikroTik "wireless wire" for about $200 which is the first time I hear of them, but is there anything similar in price and management that can be done with Unify? The "building to building bridge" is $500 and seems to need some sort of management console (I think it can run in a VM so plausible). Any decent known solutions under $500 total?

So I got the community edition and this alone has made my life so much easier you don’t even understand. Previously we were using an outdated version of BEXE by veritas and veeam blows this out of the water. Just wanted to show you guys a little appreciation since I know we don’t get it often as Sys admins again thank you.

 I have been searching all over the web, Microsoft and Reddit and I can't seem to find the answer to this issue...
 I have a client that requested O365 email encryption. I set them up with a E3 license to do so. When they first went to send encrypted emails, Outlook said that Information Protection was not enabled on their tenant. I used Powershell to enable and now they can send out encrypted emails.
 The issue is, instead of the email arriving where they can open it in a browser with a code... they get an email that requires the Information protection viewer and a Microsoft account.
 This is obviously to much for most recipients to be able to handle (I know... trust me... I know...).
 Here is the thing, when I send an encrypted email out of our organization it arrives in the code/web format. However, when my client sends it... it's always a .rpmsg and requires the viewer to open.
 Does anyone know what I need to change to make it use the code/web version?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a request from our security folks to look into disabling HTTPS access on the spines and leaves in our ACI environment if we don't use it. To the best of my knowledge, we don't use the object store browser on the leaves themselves, we really only use the web interface on the APICs. I reached out to TAC and they recommended creating a new set of contracts and EPGs for in-band and out-of-band, applying a filter to block HTTPS to the contracts, and adding the leaves and spines to those new EPGs for in-band and out of band.
 I went ahead and built this and moved some leaves into the new EPGs, and the block works for out-of-band (e.g. I can nc -zv <leaf_OOB_address> 443 and get no response), but not in-band, and it's not clear why. Initially my thought was to set the filter to block 443 as a source port and add the contract as a provided contract, which seems to be what works for the OOB port. On the in-band EPG, I did the same thing, adding a filter for source port 443 > any and setting my new contract as a provided contract. That did not work, so I've since tried adding a filter for any > dest port 443, changing it to a consumed contract instead of provided, etc. I've opened up a TAC case, but they took a look at what I had configured and said it seemed right, so they're waiting on feedback from a higher level engineer to see if there's something additional needed.
 Does it sound like there's something I'm missing?

 All answers are acceptable.

 I should first start off saying that I have no real knowledge or experience with networking. I’m an investigator trying to solve a problem here so I appreciate any simplistic answers.
 Essentially a client was extorted online through social media in which I have confirmed their IP addresses as of October 10, 2022 as:
 197.210.76.195
 197.210.76.208
 Both are Nigerian
 Through further investigation I found a suspect who logged into social media also on October 10, 2022 using the IP address of 197.210.76.99.
 What are the odds they are the same person?
 I have found similar connections in which the xxx.xxx.xxx have all matched but the last numbers were different, however they were generally a day or two apart. The above are the only IP addresses in which occurred on the same date.
 I appreciate any help on this!
 Thank you so much for the time.
 Cheers!

 It's been raised with me that we have a possibility of stale DNS records with the default scavenging time of 7 days, although this has caused no operational issue, I've had grumbles this is not best practice.
 So opening out the question, am I doing this correctly, or does everyone else have 2 week DHCP leases to endure DNS and scavenging always stays in line with DHCP. Or is 2 days perfectly ok?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years ago, I read David Allen's "Getting Things Done" and his time management method clicked with me. It was pretty tool agnostic, and served me well for a number of years. Though I learned I needed to CYA more than most people would by archiving more stuff than most people would. I used a modified version of it for years with a decent amount of success with only a minimal of stuff falling through the cracks.
 I looked at a few other systems, such as Pomodoro, and one other one I can't recall.
 Last night, I started reading "Getting Results the Agile Way" written by J.D. Meier, who works at Microsoft. Many people praised it as an excellent time management strategy, and either a good replacement for GTD or a nice complement to GTD. I don't want to get too deep in the weeds on this, but a lot of his guiding principals just DO NOT work for me. His methodology is not about Agile project management, it's more about being agile in how you manage your work.
 At work, we're HEAVILY focused on implementing Agile. For my day-to-day work, it's been a COMPLETE AND UTTER failure. For all my project work, it's also been an utter disaster, mostly because I don't work on any custom development projects. It's all infrastructure upgrade stuff and COTS upgrades.
 I can obviously continue to use my hybrid method. But I'm curious if anyone is following a time management system that helps organize the insanity.

Aside from that, I am trying to understand how a wildcard certificate works. I have added SSL certificates in the past, but the wildcard piece I don't quite understand. 
 Once I purchase the wildcard certificate, I need a CSR. Does that CSR come from the first application I am needing my SSL certificate for? I read somewhere that I need to first add the wildcard certificate to my ADCS server first and that is where I get my CSR using IIS. This part confuses me. 
 In the future, when I need a new SSL certificate for a different application, do I log in to NS and create another wildcard certificate with a subdomain? Or do I use *.domain.com every time? I feel like if I create a new one, it will remove the previous CSR I submitted and break that application. Again, this part confuses me as well.
 I would appreciate a quick explanation of how this works. Bonus points if you have used NS before, as bad as they are.

 As part of our build hardning process, we are looking at enabling SMB signing across our laptop and desktop estate, and then eventually server estate. We are already at 80% CIS L2 compliance but this is a big sticking point for us.
 We have legacy servers. Its the ussal stuff every org has, ancient 2003 / 2008 servers running mission critical agents, databases etc. 
 I am just wanting to make sure that there werent any major gotcha's when it comes to enabling SMB singing, specifically when it comes to sysvol access. We have some legacy DCs running 2008r2 to allow our legacy xpe thin clients to communicate and want to make sure enabling it wont impact us.
 MS docs arent very helpful for this. Decomm of legacy kit is in the pipeline and is being worked on but we could do wiht some advise.

I have installed middleware for the card and thought i have all services running. When i get to the logon screen, it recognizes the smart card and has the option to enter my pin but before i can enter it, the option goes away and only leaves me with user/pass. Is there anything i am missing that would cause this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there!
 I'm stuck on a problem that I feel shouldn't be so hard to crack, but I can't find a good solution for it.
 I was handed a users Windows 10 VM. For some reason the original domain user account got removed from the system a while ago and re-added and - I think for that reason - it has a different SID now. Now, there are still files in that old SID's $Recycle.bin and I was asked to recover all of them to their original location. Those files are all still there, I can see them with WinDirStat.
 Now my first instinct was, restoring files that are still in the $Recycle.Bin shouldn't be too hard, right? I mean, they are all still on the drive. But damn, I'm doing research for hours now on how to do it and can't find a way. Luckily it's a VM, so first thing I did was taking a snapshot, so nothing can go wrong when I toy around with the filesystem.
 Opening the folder in Explorer with my Domain-User Account of course is not helping since the files are tied to a different user.The next thing I tried was simply to rename the Recycle Bin subfolder, that includes the old SID as a folder name, to my SID. After I log into my user account then, Windows now tells me my Recycle Bin is corrupted and asks if I want to delete it. So, I reverted to my snapshot.
 There are tons of tools out there that can recover deleted files from NTFS, but seemingly no tools to recover still existing files from the recycler?

 We recently introduced Active Directory to our company and I was hired to administrate that. Howevery my boss is also using the same server to store confidential company data on that same server. How can he limit my access to these volumes while maintaining enough rights to administrate the server? 
 He tried to remove every account inside the security permissions list beside himself but I can change the ownership of the file by going into "advanved security permissions settings" (button down below) and just changing the ownership to my AD Account again and adding back all my permissions. I am inside the "domain-admin" group btw.

 I have been tasked with quite the pickle of a problem - we operate globally, and since the pandemic, a lot of our sites have switched to a hybrid working model, up to (almost, but never exclusively) home office. 
 Now, our business is in the field of high-end CAE / Engineering, so high performance / powerful Laptops are a must (Think Dell Precision 7670/7770 with i7/i9 CPUs, Quadro GPU, 64+ GB of Ram). 
 This led to a very peculiar problem though, namely home office in regions of the world that get very hot in summer, and where people are too poor / it is not usual to have AC at home - we're talking operating temperatures of up to 45C (113F). 
 No common Laptop is rated for this (they all top out at 35C / 95F), and even the performance ones will throttle heavily at these temperat…]]></summary>

 How do YOU deal with them in a way where you don't get drained and stressed out, so you're not mentally and physically fit to still help the 90% rest of the users, that don't come running every second day?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, we’ve moved our tiny office to a new town and the new place has password protected WiFi as part of the lease using the guest wifi, which is fast enough but we’re used to having our own line for Ethernet devices and a private internal network paid for by us. 
 It being fast enough and free is a real help though, and would save us quite a lot, so we were wondering if there’s a way we can utilise it.
 Is there a way to use the guest WiFi login as the incoming line but have our own router create a new network off that with WiFi/Ethernet? We have a draytek vigor 2860ac in a box from the move along with an AirPort Express if that’s of any use, and the new building appears to be using ubiquiti circular ceiling APs of which one is in our new room. 
 I’m semi literate with all this, but there’s definitely a lot of the draytek back end that is past my current knowledge so hopefully I’ll keep up!
 Thanks very much

 we are looking for a web-based tool for a self-management of AD-groups. Has anyone an advice? 
 To give some background: We use Linux clients company wide. So any windows-based tool is impossible or needs further expenses we would like to avoid.
 The process is that IT creates the AD-group and defines an owner. The owner (can be everyone in the company) has to check/set members. So the tool should allow to resolve nested-groups to actual people/member. The process of checking the members and the overall requirement of the AD-group itself is part of the compliance processes and belongs to the group owner.
 Right now it's resolved over tickets to the IT which blocks way too much time on the admin side. 
 Our idea is a web-tool which gives all the AD-groups belonging to the owner in a view where they can see the members and add/delete them from the group. Deleting/creating the group shall still be part of IT.

 I'm from Germany and evaluating public clouds (esp. for compute, databases, storage, etc.) for our company (30 ppl) regarding a potential migration. Coming from on-premise with dedicated servers I'm collecting pro/cons and potential challenges with a migration and looking for experiences of others who either did or did not a migration:
 - How did your setup looked like before and after migration?
 - What did go wrong during your migration?
 - What's most important to look at in preparation or during migration?
 - Maybe especially for German folks: How did you handle privacy issues (GDPR etc.) and why did you either chose a German or non-german cloud provider?
 - Are there any cloud trends we should look at specifically?
 - What would you love to see changed in public clouds (and is a regular blocker or problem for you)?
 - Which cloud are you using (and why) or why did you not migrated to a cloud?
 Thanks for any comment and thanks for sharing your experience!

 I'm a bit confused on what I can do with radius authentication on a switch DELL N2024. Inside my network I have a lot of programmers that are using some virtual machines for executing vendor based software in their laptop. These virtual machines are otside the domain and also of my control (no antivirus, no policy, ecc). I thougth of isolate the VM traffic using the network authentication in the host PC and also in the VM. The idea is to put the host inside a VLAN that can comunicate with the secure area and the VM in a restricted VLAN. The host usually use only one NIC shared, is it possible with radius authentication assign different VLAN on the same switch port based on the authentication?
 ​
 Any other suggestion will be apreciated. In the era of cryplocker the risk of keep all the traffic together is too big.
 ​
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I had the same issue twice with Windows Server DHCP service in two different customers in the past few weeks.
 Customer 1: Windows Server 2016 Domain Controller (with DNS and DHCP roles)
 Customer 2: Windows Server 2012 R2 Domain Controller (with DNS and DHCP roles)
 Issue: after installing Windows updates as scheduled, the VM reboots. After reboot, two events are generated in the Event Viewer and the VM stops giving DHCP addresses. The Lease page under DHCP panel is empty.
 Event 1: 
 ID 20090
 SOURCE "DHCP-Server"
 Description " DHCP Server is unable to bind to UDP port number 67 as it is used by another application. This port must be made available to DHCP Server to start servicing the clients."
 Event 2: 
 ID 1041
 SOURCE "DHCP-Server"
 Description " The DHCP service is not servicing any DHCPv4 clients because none of the active network interfaces have statically configured IPv4 addresses, or there are no active interfaces. "
 Resolution:
 Restarting "DHCP server" service fixes the issue. It is still unknown what exactly causes this issue.
 Has anyone encountered anything similar?
 PS. Sorry for my English I'm not a native speaker

 I was trying to find an eventlog eventid for the beginning of login and for when the taskbar is loaded. I've got 7001 for beginning but haven't seen anything which matches load of the desktop/taskbar. Any suggestions would be welcome.
 More info:
  
Hybrid AD joined Windows 10 22H2
 All recent i5 / 16GB laptops
 FSLogix profile redirection
 All devices on WiFi
  
I have tried getting Intune Endpoint Analytics working but very few of the devices are reporting and I haven't been able to determine why. But the downside of this is that it doesn't give a number of seconds, only a score and only reflects when CPU goes below 50% after login.
 My goal is two-fold.
  
Identify problematic endpoints and/or users.
 Prove to management that the median sign-in time is reasonable.
  
(yes, I now know that FSLogix was the wrong choice)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm doing a deep dive on IPsec right now, trying to understand what exactly is happening under the hood. Went ahead and read (portions) of RFC 4301 but I'm getting conflicting information here regarding the implementation of the SADB vs the SDB.
 In section 4.4.1.2, they walk through the structure of an SDB entry, saying that it includes the following:
  
Match criteria (selectors, names)
 Action (protect/bypass block)
 IPsec Protocol Type
 IPsec Mode
 Tunnel Source & Destination
 Algorithms
 A few other things (i.e. DF bit & DSCP handling)
  
This all sounds well and fine... then I got to 4.4.2.1, talking about the SADB... and some of the same fields are listed there again, including Algorithms (but this time described in greater detail?) as well as the DF bit and DSCP handling piece... I just figured that there was a bit of overlap or something... but then I went to Appendix C, which also describes an SDB entry... and it had even more fields listed which I thought were SADB-only... specifically, the SA lifetime.
 So I'm a bit confused here... would appreciate it if someone could answer the following questions.
  
Are the encryption & confidentiality algoritms included in both the SADB and SDB? Or is the "algorithms" piece in an SDB entry referring to something else?
 Which fields are supposed to overlap between the two databases... and also, why?

 Hey,
 Working on getting a 2022 template in place, and the admin password has been lost, no issues, thought I would reset it the old way with cmd from recovery mode and replace utilman.
 although I can get to recovery and get CMD, for the life of me I can not find what they have mapped c: to, I have been through the whole alphabet from A to Z, I get a hit on x for the recovery.
 I thought I would try from the iso and use the fix my system option, I get a hit once again on x and d this time, but only setup files, not the actual c: drive.
 VM is booting efi and secure boot is off, any thoughts? Is this method still possible or they finally removed it?

 So a client the other day had clicked a phishing link, entered a password and had some mallard on her system.
 Was able to remediate the initial problem.
 However the client was intent that her system be wiped.
 While onsite, went through and backed up all of the regular folders, documents, downloads, etc.
 I asked the client if this looked okay, she stated that's fine as all of her data was mostly on the cloud. I did double check with her as I have had horror stories with this in the past and she was confident in the cloud.....
 Wiped the machine and have been working on file recovery every since as a lot of the quickbooks files were locally stored. Pulled all of them back from the dead but now they aren't working in QB.
 Feel horrible and still working on it as we speak.. please ask any questions to fill in the blanks of my panic story as I'm sure I've missed a lot of details.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So my boss retired during COVID lockdown and I've been the interim since then. Went through the whole business of transitioning people to work from home and then back , lots of hours of supervision on top of my sysadmin duties, 50-60 hours work week. Since it is a state agency, we have to apply for the job officially, nobody gets a hand waive promotion if you may. So I applied and to my biggest surprise they offered the job to an outside person who has no sysadmin skills but ran a larger department with more workers. 
 That tells me that my work is not valued and I should start applying for other jobs, right now I feel pretty disappointed and angry at upper management. I have not broken the news to my staff yet because I don't want to be emotional about it, but man I am pissed. I do love being a sysadmin and not have to do front office kind of things. Maybe I will now work for the amount of money they pay me, which is low but with a lot of perks.
 What would you do?

 We have a new web application that sends LDAPS requests to our AD servers over a site-to-site VPN.
 I found out today that during the LDAPS authentication process, the remote app saves the user's password in the app's database. Presumably it's then passed to the app.
 Is this normal? I thought the LDAPS process was simply to get a success/fail authentication and that success/fail is passed on.
 Obviously I don't like my AD passwords saved in someone else's database, even if they are encrypted.

Fortunately the team thar needed to address the ticket doesn't sit in the office so headed over to my desk to expedite. (I am the head of the department with a couple levels between me and the support desk)
 I asked him if he had a ticket in, and he said "yes but need this right away for something I am doing for the CEO."
 I informed him, "if you put in a ticket our typical SLA is a day or two. It will be worked based on urgency."
 "Well can you check the status?"
 "I assure you if you put the ticket it then if is in the queue and will be processed."
 He left dejected and huff, "I don't understand why it takes a couple of days to just push some buttons."
 I always appreciate the arrogance of people who think they can name drops and bully their way into the front of the line. That isn't our company culture and I know the CEO well enough to know the would be upset if they knew I let this guy skip in line.
 For what's is worth, I reviewed what they were asking for and it isn't something that will be approved anyway. Somebody showed him a beta system that isn't production ready and now he is demanding access--he isn't a beta tester for the system and his desire is to use it for production use.
 Icing on the cake, one of my team members picked up the ticket about an hour after it was submitted and made multiple attempts to reach the manager and couldn't get a response back from them today. As usual it is ultra critical but not critical enough to actually respond.

 Now I get there is should be a vast difference in capability between the bottom and top and companies have a different requirements and risk acceptance factors.
 However I will give the example I worked at a hospice for 50k and they wanted me to hire infrastructure engineers at 23k which was just not possible for competent ones anyway. I explained the risks of hiring people that needed training and asked tounge in cheek why don’t we hire doctors without the experience to perform the role to save money? Well the answer is that’s illegal and we have to pay going rate.
 So my question in a roundabout way is IT salaries so out of Wack because there is no professional accredited body that makes doing IT work illegal without.
 Would it actually benefit IT to have such a body even just for government work. Even if it is a joke like part P or Gas safe but atleast shows some competence

 I have four routers within the same AS and in all 4 routers, BGP is configured. Network 'X' is advertised into BGP, R2 and R3 are working as Route reflectors. R2 is receiving 'x' with a default local preference of 100. Now I want R3 to receive LP 150 so I applied the route map in the OUT direction on R2(towards R3). But R3 is still having local preference 100. I can see the change only if I applied the Route map in IN direction on R3. Same with origin code and metric. I can see changes only on applying the route map in IN direction.
 Why LP/origin/metric isn't propagating from R2 in the update message?
 Sorry for my bad grammar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Afternoon guys. I am the lone sysadmin of a small 25 person office.
 ​
 We have a laptop refresh coming up - 25 Lenovo T14 laptops running Win10.
 We don't deploy new laptops very often - maybe every 5 years. We do not have an imaging infrastructure in place.
 I would like to keep things as simple as possible as I have other things on my To-Do list.
 Here is my plan: Please feel free to comment or add some advice as you see fit.
 ​
  
I plan on building out one of the new Lenovos with all our software and the latest updates.
 
Then sysprep it.
 Use Clonezilla to capture the image onto an SSD or thumb drive
 Then set up a small mini lab where we can deploy 4 or 5 laptops at a time with the image
 Add newly imaged laptops to domain and tweak for individual users (mapped drives, bookmarks, etc.)
  
Question. I plan on just using a thumb drive to boot up Clonzilla on the laptops and using a local SSD drive or thumb drive to host the image file for each laptop. Would it make a speed difference if I store the image file on an SSD USB -C drive as opposed to a regular USB-A drive? 
 ​
 Thanks guys for any wisdom.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, the following scenario came into my mind, when reading about dynamic routing/tunneling when providing a backup path to a destination.
 In the example there should be one backup path with only static routing to the destiantion, but it should react to a topology change and use the backup path(floating route). The backup/floating static route has a Administrative Distance (AD) of 5 and the primary route an AD of 1.
 https://postimg.cc/ygzqnK5H
 So, if the traffic is tunneld over IPsec (or other tunneling protocol) and the primary tunnel interface goes down, then the static route with an AD of 1 is removed from both routing tables and the second tunnel with the floating static route is used? 
 Is scenario 2 a possible solution to solve scenario 1? 
 Do vendors like cisco or fortinet behave the same way, when scenario 2 is configured?

 Now the device won't accept the password that previously worked. I did not change any other settings except the DNS servers from the default since everything else is locked.
 What exactly did I do wrong? The device has no WAN connection what so ever.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, we currently have a syslog server that we use to help monitor our network. Part of the syslog messages that we depend on is "received bytes and sent bytes" to determine bandwidth usages. This works fine for Juniper/Watchguard/Sonicwalls but now we are trying to add a Meraki MX into the mix and we can get all the info we want from it forwarded to syslog besides the bytes.
 Apparently Cisco only sends that info through Netflow. So I don't really want to purchase an enterprise Netflow collector just for this small bit of information. I don't need a fancy analyzer or anything, just something that is able to collect and forward the info we want. I have looked into a couple via Google and other posts (like ntopng) but haven't had much luck getting this working so far. Any ideas/tips are appreciated!

I have went through the documentation on Nvidia Hub and to be honest their documentation is awful, I have not seen any topics on port isolation or PVLAN although it seems like it would be possible in linux bridge but I don't know it its integrated into switchdev and would be offloaded to the ASIC.
 Ideally I would like to have hybrid ports with untagged and tagged that are isolated from each other but able to communicate with the privileged port. Most implementation examples I see are for ONYX OS and it assumes that the restricted ports are access only. Yes it's non typical but needed in this particular situation. TIA

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our licensing is up soon for VMWare and my rep reached out to talk about their “new, better” VSphere+ subscription model (a bunch of nonsense to just make more money off of us, by the way they want to bill PER CORE now) that they are looking to implement within the next year, though right now I have the option to re license under our previous agreement “but if I sign up for 3 years with the new VSphere+ they can guarantee my subscription pricing per core and lock in that rate”. Sounds a lot to me like they’re trying to con people into their new pricing scheme before everyone jumps ship when Broadcom fully takes over and destroys their product just like they have for everything else. I was trying to remain hopeful that maybe this time it would be different but…Broadcom hasn’t even fully taken over yet and they’ve already almost doubled my licensing cost per year with this new scheme, what a scam. I got a laugh when I got the cautionary reminder at the end of the email “the price can be locked in year over year with VSphere+, but the price can’t be guaranteed when you’re up for renewal next year if you don’t go with the proposed pricing”. 
 Needless to say, I’m going to talk to my team about it all but I believe we’re are going to be in the market for something else. Anyone have any recommendations? Has anyone else made the migration to something new recently?

 The daughtercard is:
 ConnectX-4 Lx 25 GbE SFP28
 The SFPs are: SFP28-25G-SR-NOF (but I'm not sure if FEC is enabled)
 I read that the DFE tuning delay can cause the adapter to not link up when it isn't set to 3000ms, but the ports are still flapping for some unknown reason, and that seems more like a complete loss of network scenario. 
 Can FEC when mismatched on the switch and server side cause a port flap?
 The links would also not link up with the link speed forced to 25gbit, they will only link with auto negotiation.
 At one point, all of the adapters flapped at the same time.
 ​
 Any advice appreciated.

 I'm trying to configure this net:
  
3 Tagged VLANS
 1 Untagged VLAN (Default)
 Fortinet 60F Router
 Allied Telesis x510 (52 ports) Switch
  
All VLANS are connected from the router to the switch with a single cable (port that I have configured as promiscuous). Subsequently, I have configured the rest of the ports through the interface as "Untagged" ports by groups according to which VLAN I want each port to receive. 
 As I understood, with this, I should be able to connect a PC to any of the ports assigned to a VLAN (tagged or untagged) and the computer would receive internet without having to configure the VLAN ID on the network card of the computer.
 Also, I need some ports to offer multiple VLANS so that I can configure APs with guest wifi that cannot access the rest of the network.
 However, I only receive internet on the ports that I have not configured a specific VLAN.
 What am I misising? 
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We recently had a switch in our website hosting provider and I'm hitting my head against the wall on what I'm missing here. Everything works externally, but we have a split-brain DNS setup in our internal network. It's been set up that way for a long time and it's not something I can completely remove unfortunately, at least not right now.
 So externally, www.domain.com resolves and is proxied through Cloudflare and life is good. (see screenshot in attached album)
 Internally, however, is where things aren't currently working. Our previous hosting provider had a trusted CA issued cert installed on the origin server, and so we could simply point our internal DNS to the same public IP that CF was pointed to and everything would work fine. This new hosting provider insists on having a self signed cert on their side however. Why this is I'm still trying to figure out in my continued discussions with them, but for now that's what we've got and obviously that causes issues with 'site unsecure' warnings if we set it up like we had done before.
 So what I was trying to do is simply point our internal DNS to the CF proxied route, and per here and here I was under the impression I could simply create a CNAME entry for www.domain.com and point it to www.domain.com.cdn.cloudflare.net. (see screenshot in attached album). But clearly I'm still missing something because even with that things aren't working - Chrome gives an "ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED" error even though NSLOOKUP seems to resolve to the CF IP's just fine (again, see screenshots in attached album). 
 Anyone dealt with a similar issue before? Thank you!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I was wondering if anyone here had a computer stipend for certain departments in your companies ? 
 I am trying to find out the pro/cons for letting engineers have their own stipend to pick out their computers vs we pick out their computers .
 Either way they would be required to have intune and follow compliance policies. It’s only a matter of whether they tell us what they want and we order it or we pick what they use.
 Would love to hear experiences and pro/cons

 I upgrade a VM from Configuration level 5.0->9.0 and it worked fine, except hyper-v didnt remove the snapshots, instead it created 4 VM's off the VM's snapshot. VM's that when i try to delete says it doesnt exist, or throws an error when trying to open.

 I'm not sure what to do about this? I cant delete, or 'open' them i just get errors. Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 Quick question, how do I go about finding network engineer roles which are more focused on network automation ? I'm barely getting any matches on job boards when I search "network automation" and "netdevops". 90% of the traditional senior/network engineer roles I see just say python or ansible is a plus.
 From what it looks like I may have to just get lucky ? and find a company that either is about to start this journey or already has started and looking for engineers to join the team.
 I'm using indeed and linkedin for my job searches.
 Thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I have been lurking for some time, and now could really use some good advice.
 The story is, we are a retail chain with around 15 stores, 2 offices and a large online presence. I came onboard about 3 years ago with the responsibility for our ERP, Azure hosting and web team. The other guy took care of all hardware, some support and the odd jobs that came up. Between us we also took care of all the different hardware and software people use. We have around 200 employees across parttime to fulltime.
 The other guy was beginning to slack a bit, came in late and did not always do his tasks, so the CEO had made a plan with me where I should be the head of IT in 6 to 12 months and we should hire more people, at minimum a Sysadmin and a Supporter.
 We had not yet presented the plan for my colleague.
 Yesterday they found my colleague dead in his apartment, and I got a call from the CEO about it, where he stated that I was now head of IT and should start as soon as possible.
 My plan is to start securing we have access to all the systems he worked with, and create a common password database in something like Bitwarden. Then talk to all the different departments about what projects they had going on, and how to get support moving forward.
 I could really use some advise, where would you guys start?
 Rest in piece other guy, I will keep your lasts sessions online for as long ass possible. You will be missed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So you may have seen my post a few weeks ago about cyber insurance deeming MFA on every single admin device, network equipment, accounts etc. We’re slowly working down our list of stuff that we need to action, but as I am not that clued up on network, our manager is the one responsible for the network and network switches across all our offices. Some of these switches are 10-20 years old, and absolutely cannot support any form of MFA, even RADIUS. The rest of the team saw this as a great opportunity for a use case to replace these old switches with something more modern and would be compliant with our requirements. Our manager has grown to have a bit of a reputation within the team of just being lazy, and only wants to touch what he knows. Whilst our insurance deems it a requirement to protect these switches with MFA, the argument we got back was “what are they going to do? Look what device is plugged in?”
 Apart from the fact these switches are almost 20 year old so have obvious security flaws in them anyway, what would the worst case scenario be if someone malicious had access to a switch within a network?

 Office repair and uninstall/reinstall

 Is there any way i can have a usb-C switch? So i can leave them both plugged in and just flip between them to toggle the connection.
 I tried googling but I’m unsure of what the name for a cable/device would be.
 I should also mention it needs to allow power delivery, display, network and usb

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like many others we moved to use “known folder move” some time ago. As part of that we set up two things: 1. A baseline in sccm to check folders are in the expected locations. Eg. C:\users\Geoff\onedrive - contoso\desktop (or pictures or documents) 2. The admin reports policy so we can use the reports at confit.microsoft.com
 We hit go and watched with glee as the admin report went from 0% to around 90%. Never got to 100.. and forgot about it all as we moved to more important things.
 Now I’m reviewing our settings and status and I’ve found a couple of weird things
 Firstly some users have moved their folders into random folders, or so it would seem, like into the sub folder of some obscure project. Too few to be a mis configuration, too many for it to be accidental drag and drops.
 Secondly the admin reports have gone backwards, sitting at 75% or so
 Has anyone else had these experiences? Are you doing any manual remediation on these things? Should I be worried about any of this?!

I did buy a server for my SME back in 2019 which sadly broke down about 2months ago. After testing thoroughly and going to multiple stores that said they can fix this server. I found out its the board and the cpu that died and since Dell emailed back telling me that theres nothing they'll do because it was a few month after the warranty ended and fixing would cost as much as buying it new any board/cpu I should know that would fit right with the components I already have? I remember back when I was reusing dell's gaming pc, the mb would have its front io pins which will not work with normal pc cases in the market. I did find my way around by buying front IO cables from china that was modified for dell's front IO. I am not sure if I am wasting my time trying to fix this server, will it be difficult to find a board that fits the case? 
 The server was a EMC R340 bought in 2019 with Xeon E 2124 + R171TT1 MB 17086-1

 What is this and is it safe to delete?

 Tomorrow, I have a replacement motherboard coming as this one has a bad USB controller. Do I need to do anything to those VMs or even my Windows 11 host before I swap the boards? Host is also the same, not bitlocked, just secure boot enabled. I am worried that the swap is going to break boot because of the TPM settings.
 Any guidance on this would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi.
 We have 600 legacy 'programs' that have embedded credentials so they can be installed without admin rights. (can't get rid of the at this point sadly...) 
 We've recently started a shift from onprem AD to azure with autopilot, and our domian name changed. Let's call them:
 CompanyOnPrem. com
 CompanyCloud. com
 The embedded ID authenticates against CompanyOnPrem. com\account1. This account is synchronized with AzureAD so it has the correct rights in CompanyCloud, but of course the programs won't install because CompanyOnPrem is also embedded in the install file. 
 HOWEVER! If I open anything (run CMD as a different user/admin) on the device using the CompanyCloud as the domain just once, now all the install files work perfectly.
 To summarized: 
 File has CompanyOnPrem. com\account1 embedded & will not install. 
 Open CMD as account1@CompanyCloud. com and close it. Now all install files work fine. 
 It's like running it once is creating a pointer or a DNS rescored that redirects the authentication - which is actually great for us. 
 Does anyone know specifically what is happening and where these credentials are stored?

I'm in the military and my contract is about to end, and I've set myself up to be decently comfortable doing DOD networking without a uniform. I have a degree, Sec+, CCNA, and hopefully about to pass my ENCOR. I really enjoy networking and want to get paid what I'm worth since enlisted military doesn't get paid very well. I'd like to get ENARSI soon after because it sounds fun, but even studying for the ENCOR I see how much emphasis Cisco puts on their products and automation and I really just don't get much joy from learning all that. I'm also unsure how AI and automation is going to affect the networking career field 10, 20 years from now.
 If I choose to go the cyber security route I'd have to reenlist for another 4 years and live a restrictive life with bad pay - but I'd be put on the path for some cool defensive cyber operation skills. I'd get schooling, certifications, and be working with a very very exclusive club. As far as I can tell, these guys get paid more than networking guys too. 
 I know there's a lot of people with much more experience and knowledge than me here and I was hoping maybe you could tell me something that would sway me into one direction or another.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Started a new job recently that suffers from not having any processes or procedures in place. Things like "change management" are actively avoided by senior staff because "it'll just slow us down". I try to advocate that a functional change control process should not slow down change but encourage it.
 Additionally, we had an incident occur with one of our services recently and while the response was ok, nothing was written down by my team members. No incident ticket, no post-incident review, nothing. Service is back up, incident over. I'd assume that each person has their own personal notepad++ open to write down the incident response notes.
 My direct suggested I make a proposal things I would like implement, i.e. a system for tracking changes, ongoing problems, incidents etc. but as I'm writing the proposal I find myself wondering what I'm even doing. It's obvious that this isn't even a priority for higher ups so I'm probably just wasting time right? 
 Maybe I'm getting in my own head too much, maybe I'm frustrated this keeps happening at every IT department:(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Long time lurker, first time poster. Looking for any advice from my peers.
 On-premise Exchange 2016, active sync and web accss enabled email account. Have an MSP for Network config and support, no access to firewall or network monitoring.
 User reports one morning her account is locked, unlock it, locked again within a minute. Go through the normal steps; make sure your phone isn’t locking you account, logged into another device, etc.
 Logs reveal Exchange is the source of the lockouts, try disabling web access, OWA, and active sync for this user. Lockouts continue. Escalate for Network help from MSP.
 They determine it’s coming from overseas multiple IPs, etc. I ask if we can Geo Lock, block it, or whatever their recommendation is. I also asked why if Web Access is disabled that the login attempts matter.
 They confer with the IT Manager and decide to have me change the user account name to [username]2. I protest that this isn’t really a fix as much as ignoring the problem. Decision made.
 I change user account to (2), and then resolve the issues with connected apps because they are now a new account for many apps. Also reset and re-enroll users MDM controlled cell phone. Issue is “resolved”.
 I don’t like this solution, but I don’t know how to explain why to the IT Manager or what I should have expected from the MSP. If anyone is willing, please give me some advice.
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry this is slightly off topic. I work for a large organization that occasionally has phone numbers marked as "spam". We usually find out about this after a customer mentions it. We'll test on various personal cell phones and submit removal requests to carriers, and they remove the flag. 
 This only happens once or twice a year. We follow pretty strict anti-spam call policies, but sometimes they still get marked. 
 Is there an API that we can use to check numbers daily? I've tried Twilio's phone-number lookup endpoint, but I don't think it will give spam signals. We even signed up for a "phone number reputation" service that did absolutely nothing to protect our numbers. 
 Would love to know what others are doing to monitor their brand's phone number reputations.

 Not sure if this is an issue that any of you face, but how do you monitor changes the Terms of Use for your suppliers?
 We currently use approximately 1,000,000* SaaS products, along with a frankly extremely difficult ISP, who all follow the trend of: "Our ToS are at this url, it's on you to check it regularly, you have 30 days to kick up a fuss when we change them to be worse"
 Do you use a product to monitor these web pages? If so what do you use? And if not would there be some value for you in someone making one in their downtime? I am considering making something just for my own purposes, but if there's a market I'll happily release it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 So I've worked in "Networks" for almost 9 years now (wow it's gone fast!). The first 4 years I was your traditional networking engineer/admin working mainly on Datacentre and a little bit of Enterprise networks which I enjoyed but found the pace and travelling a bit stressful, although I think that was mainly due to the work culture i was in. I left that role in a hurry as the company took a turn for the worst and I got a Systems Engineering role focused on communications(networks). I've been here for nearly 5 years now and I find it quite mundane and none challenging and the pay is quite a bit lower compared to engineers working in I.T.
 I have considered going back into I.T but as ive been away from the CLI and "traditional" networking for a while I feel like I won't be able to. I guess you could say I've traded my hands on experience for more theory knowledge, understanding protocol standards, more physical layer including RF and the innerworkings of network devices and how they are integrated into a system of systems rather than end users. I know this is quite a unique situation but just wondering if any one has done something similar? Or has any opinions on me being able to get another job in I.T. Happy to answer more detailed questions if needed.

 I am curious: What devices do you use for NAT/Routing at the Uplink of big Networks (like 20 Gbit/s, 60k Clients). Currently we‘re using MikroTik CCR1072 for it, but recently discovered Netgate TNSR. For Switches, we are a complete HPE-Shop and would consider MikroTik to prosumer for the task, but somehow, we ended up with this white box in our biggest core rack … Our smaller setups use Sophos Systems, but we feel like they‘re not purpose built to be fast packet-spitting roaring routing machines.

 Based on my limited experience and research, Adtran seems to be the winner here for smaller deployments like my planned one but maybe there is something I don't know?
 I know about Ubiquiti Networks PON platform already and it's a possibility but I'd like to invest in something a bit more in line with what some of the other operators around me are using rather than be a one-off (even if that's the way I end up going in the end).

 Is the advice in the Wiki for the most part still relevant? A lot of the posts it links to are are roughly a decade old and I was wondering if the advice from those posts would still hold up today.
 I understand the requirement to be constantly learning and updating skills in the field and that it is not for everyone, but I would just like to know if what I read through is still a good starting point.
 I am just considering my options as I wish to get out of my current position (retail management). I used to have a pretty strong passion for IT but it kind of died with my current career.

 The switches are brand new, I tried the setup with no stacking fiber cables connected and with the cables connected too.
 I can execute every command fine, but when I get to execute
 ​
  
FS(config-vsl-port)#port-member interface Tengigabitethernet 0/49
  
​
 I get this error back:
 ​
  
Port tengigabitethernet 0/49 could not be configured to vsl. 
 Port check failed.
  
​
 I tried other ports but I get the same error, what can I do? Someone who had experience with this vendor switch? The switches are brand new with default configuration out of the box.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, hoping someone can help me. I’m trying to find a HP SFP matrix similar to the Cisco one. I’ve got the following switches. JG924A-1920-24G (Non-PoE), HP JD992A V1905-24-POE, and looking to get a HP ProCurve V1810-48G. The 48 port will be going in my loft, as will the PoE switch (this is only for cameras and sensors hence the 100mb ports) so I need the SFPs and a short fibre cable between those. Then I need SFPs between the 48G and the 24G, the fibre cable will have to run about 50 meters. If anyone can point me to which ones I need that also won’t break the bank it would be much appreciated. Tia.

Since the maximum ethernet range is about twice the range as wifi, it seemed like it would be easy to use the wifi access points as ethernet repeaters if I can find the right units and daisy chain them around the field. Power is easily available the whole way. Is this a good way to do it? If so, what are good wifi units that would let me do this?

 It was him, me, and our site manager(a woman) in a conference room with him sitting across from me and the site manager sitting next to each other. Every time the site manager asked a question, he would make it quite clear that he was responding to me because he was disgusted that a woman was in charge of the site. It was insane to watch and be the person he chose over responding to a lowly woman. I didn't know what to do. I was young and new to the company. If it happened now, I'd be all, yo, this is unacceptable but where I was in my life at that time, I chose the passive aggressive route.
 You really have to picture this in your head because it really went down this way.
 She would ask a question, he would look at me to respond, and I slowly leaned over until my head was behind hers so he had to at least look in her direction while speaking.
 She was clearly and understandably appalled at the situation but she was also trying not to laugh at what I was doing.
 Side note: The primary owner of our company is awesome and later that day told that guy to gtfo of our building and our contract was cancelled.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As part of our security policy, we have a highly segmented, firewall and switch routed network with next generation Web Application Firewalls.
 When setting up new servers, production machines, cloud services or new (client/server) applications, our firewall team needs to be involved. While that's perfectly fine, it feels like a new endeavor every time, even if it's the third or tenth machine of the same type.
 We need to specify source/destination IPs, ports, and protocols (and I'm happy with that), but don't have a very structured and repeatable approach in doing so. And the firewall teams documentation of rules and changes "in the firewall" seems somewhat intransparent. That process is time consuming with repeated discussions on why we need this port or that protocol and we sometimes end up with issues because of that.
 Can you share or recommend a lean process on requesting, documenting, and auditing firewall rules? Please also point me to other reddits if I am a bit off topic here.

 We're currently using Meraki, and I'm not overly keen on it. Crazy expensive hardware and licenses, increasingly common hardware failures, pretty average feature sets. Yet somehow it sort of just works. We can create a site to site VPN easily, manage switches and APs and firewalls from anywhere, and I have to say, I like that. 
 I was looking at potential other solutions. From their marketing, you would think Ubiquiti would be a good choice - absolutely not, I wouldn't use their stuff outside of SOHO or prosumer environments. With the possible exception of HP Aruba, it looks like most alternatives means leaving that single ecosystem that I've actually come to take for granted to an extent. Perhaps renewing the licenses next year is the best plan?
 But in any case, I'm interested to know how other people manage their networks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an odd request, but please hear me out. My company provides control panels with very small (like 2-3 device) isolated TCP/IP networks. Occasionally, a device needs to be serviced by connecting a laptop with programming software installed. This software interacts over a TCP/IP connection with the devices in the panel. The software is expensive, difficult to install, and difficult to license. It is not something we could just send an installer to our customers to install on a local laptop, most of the time. Furthermore, asking to remote into a customer's machine would be seen as unprofessional in this industry.
 I may post a similar question on /r/plc where I normally hang out, but I am looking for something more than the current ways I've seen/done this:
  
VERY EXPENSIVE - drive or fly to the site just to plug in an ethernet cable to the laptop with the right software on it.
 MEDIUM EXPENSE - send a laptop with the software installed to site with instructions for site personnel to get it connected to the panel's switch. This ties up a full set of software licenses (this can be 5 figure licenses)
 MEDIUM EXPENSE - send or permanently install a dedicated cellular VPN box (usually netbiter, eWon or Secomea) out that puts the engineer's licensed laptop on the panel's network
 LOWEST EXPENSE - if the customer has the right combination of competency and flexibility in their IT dept, set up VPN access to the network 
  
Ok, so here's where I'm wondering if there's a 5th option. Is there a way to set up a laptop that just functions as a VPN server, rather than client. Like, is there a cisco or whatever program I can install on a win10/11 laptop that, when running, allows remote vpn clients to access the laptop's local network? 
 All of the above is typically done as supervised, extremely temporary connections to these systems. I am aware these all represent security risks except #1. Please refrain from chastising my industry for our security practices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work maybe 6-7h each day, really not that much compared to what I read from other guys in this sub. However during that time I am hyper focused. The only break that I take is 30 minutes for lunch, and I mean really no other break at all. I don’t kick back in my seat, take care of personal stuff or get up to walk around the room for a bit. Instead I jump from one task to the next, whether that’s a meeting, monitoring alert, ticket, project, chat message, email, you name it. The stimulation is just so intense that I can’t get out once I’m in. What I don’t realize during that time is that I’m completely overstimulating by brain. I don’t give it time to process anything. So once I stop working my mind starts racing about everything I touched throughout the workday. I go over the meeting in my head, I think about if I forgot something on the ticket I worked on, if the next steps for the project are correct, etc. I go to bed with these thoughts and I wake up with them. Only after about 2 days of not working (typically on Sundays or today after a holiday) the thoughts start to slow down. This really sucks because I am not fully present with my family unless I’m on holiday and generally I’m just burning myself out. I know what I shouldn’t be doing but I just can’t stop it. I tried a couple of things to mitigate that:
  
A physical alert on my desk which goes off after 2h to remind me to get up (which I happily ignore once I’m into the vortex)
 A tool on my computer which actually blocks the screen for 5 minutes to force a break (which annoyed me too much when I was deep into something or in a meeting)
 Countless of post-its to remind me of breaks (which you guessed it, I ignore)
  
Have any of you experienced the same and found a solution to this?
 PS: I should mention that neither my boss or any external factor are forcing this behavior on me. While I had jobs in the past where that was the case, today it’s not.

 It took multiple times and rewrites of instructions to even get them to install the AV and remote software. The migration from their e-mail system to O365 from a technical standpoint was pretty smooth. However we are getting a lot of users saying its slow, mail isn't loading as it should etc etc
 I understand there is a cultural language and time barrier, and I've pleased with leadership to send me over there to get a better grasp on things and their userbase and workflows. I guess I am more venting than anything because I've tried just about everything to help them out.

 In a few month we move to a shiny new office. We will have great collab spaces but we wont have personal desks anymore, which is fine for us.
 We will have two identical 4K 27inc displays daisy chained and connect one USB-C/Thunderbolt cable to our laptops.
 Given we move between desks, will people with every new desk have to change their display order/orientation or is there a trick to it?
 All ideas are very welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there.
 We currently utilize Barracuda for our Third Party Spam Filtering. MX->Barracuda->O365.
 The only inbound connector we have is scoped to only accept mail from Barracuda IPs.
 Mail Rule to set the SCL to -1 when mail is received from Barracuda IPs to ensure O365 scanning is bypassed.
 We recently upgraded our Microsoft Licensing which allows additional email security on the O365 Side. 
 While Barracuda does a pretty good job at keeping the bad-guys away, I'm considering layering *some* of the scanning/security such that any email that comes into our organization, first passes through Barracuda for Scans, then an additional scan is done at the O365 level before delivering to the user mailbox.
 Seeing the recommendation is to enable Enhanced Filtering.
 https://campus.barracuda.com/product/emailgatewaydefense/doc/96023002/enhanced-connectors-vs-mail-flow-rules-for-spam-filtering/
 ​
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/use-connectors-to-configure-mail-flow/enhanced-filtering-for-connectors#what-happens-when-you-enable-enhanced-filtering-for-connectors
 ​
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mail-flow-best-practices/manage-mail-flow-using-third-party-cloud#scenario-1---mx-record-points-to-third-party-spam-filtering
 ​
 I'm assuming this is a modification to the existing inbound connector to enable Skip Listing, and the SkipIPs then become a list of IPs that Barracuda uses - essentially allowing us to keep the scoping in place for the connector to only allow Barracuda IPs. We would then 'remove' the SCL-1 rule.
 While this might come with some additional management - I can see the benefits of having an integrated filter in place (Impersonation etc etc).
 Anyone else setup this way? Pros? Cons? lessons learned?
 Appreciate the help.

 I joined this company around 1.5 years ago. Great company, nice people and 100% remote. I was hired to manage a Windows environment and some small Azure related projects. Down the road last year, a few key people in the company quit and I had to step up to take more responsibilities especially for managing other cloud environments (AWS/Linux and some DevOps) and I was told at that time that they'll look into getting a raise for me. I also got a few Azure/AWS certs and spent many extra hours to learn and manage these environments. Although, besides the regular 5% annual raise, there haven't been any discussions around the raise. I really enjoy my time working here but I have been told by others to start looking somewhere else but my experience has been very good with the company, and also having imposter syndrome to apply elsewhere. Would like some advice on where to go from here. Thanks! Location: ON, CA. Sal: C$60k

Restoring tabs is not an issue, but having then to manually setup the groups and add the tabs is painfull (esp. across multiple devices). Session buddy does not do this. 
 Anybody know of an extension (chrome) that saves both? and maybe even syncs the profile + tabs + groups + extensions? 
 thanks in advance for any usefull hints :)
 Edit: I found the flag #tab-groups-save so i will test that (sadly it is experimental)

 They act like people will die if they don't stay late to complete whatever task. Then they come into work depressed the next day, expecting other staff to feel sorry for them for being the "hero" who worked late. Bad luck, no one notices because other staff are living their best lives.
 Reality check 1:
 Your job isn't that important, you aren't saving the world. And that's OK.
 Reality check 2:
 Your boss is not your friend. If they were, they wouldn't let you work late. They would care about your health and wellness.
 You are an employee. Work hard but go home on time. If your boss says there's too much work, that's a management problem. They need to hire more people. You still go home on time. If they don't like that, find another job. I've been there. Yes, it's really that simple. You are exchanging time for money. This is just a business transaction.

Ever since I've popped my 3389 and 3390 ports open I've noticed brute force attempts in the security events logs. Pretty lame attempts at that, as they try different usernames with every attempt, with the occasional consistent administrator account. 
 I guess my question is, even if they were to successfully brute force my password, wouldn't they hit the same 2FA prompt that I do when I access remotely? Would they be able to access any other areas of the network or devices? I also have all my devices running through NordVPN when home which blocks all external access.

 I get no budget / spending power and they do not want to spend a PENNY on I.T / Sec. 
 I asked them if we can expand into an MSP space and they said yes, just to take it back after I signed clients and started working telling me “your job is on-demand because it’s break-fix and not full time” ( I AM THE ONLY ONE THERE AND YOUR COMPANY’s IT IS A DUMPSTER FIRE)
 I stayed patience up until yesterday where my boss assured me she’d have a compensation structure for me and the MSP vertical. I scheduled a resignation at 5:00 the next day because I knew she wouldn’t do anything and I gave them a week’s notice. 
 This is the text I got: “Your resignation is accepted and is effective immediately. Let’s coordinate a time this weekend to meet in order to go over any pending assignments and for you to transfer any assets you have to the firm. Also, please clean out your office by Sunday evening. 
 Thank you for your service and we wish you all the best in all of your future endeavors. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me directly. 
 All the best!”
 And they sent an email not including me to the rest of the staff saying that my last day was today. Like dude, I quit, don’t make it sound like you fired me. 
 I’m trying hard to not exact revenge. I was too loyal is the problem.
 Not worth $20 / hr to have every position at the same time. I polished my resume and fucked out of there before the inevitable disaster.
 Please be blunt and tell me if I’m dumb. You may need more info, I had so much shit today I forgot 90% of it.
 EDIT: I see you and I’m upvoting I promise.

 It’s been a day since we submitted a ticket for one of our customers and I have received almost nothing from them. I called to escalate early this morning. They tried to call apparently but I had no such calls come in and I’ve been at my desk since 730 am. I called again after they put the ticket on hold and requested they escalate again and reach out via email. They reached out via email requesting information and I provided everything they asked for immediately. Radio silence until I called again. Then I got an email saying my ticket has been escalated to tier 2 support. Radio silence yet again. It’s now been 30 hours since we put in the ticket and nothings happening. 
 The express ticketing status page went down around 12pm today so I can’t even see if someone’s actively working on it or not. I tried just scheduling a tech to come from the level 1 support but apparently that can’t happen without circuit team initiating it. Level 1 support somewhat admitted they have been having issues reaching the circuit team but when they saw my ticket they got audibly nervous so maybe it was just a mistake. 
 Other rant about AT&T don’t let your equipment go down or they’ll give away your IPs and they won’t even give you DHCP til you call …if you can get a hold of them. Have a new customer that just got dedicated fiber from them I set up their network a month ago got the service online but they didn’t need it for a month and a power outage knocked them offline permanently but they didn’t know until it was time to use it. Took a week to get a technician to come in and reprovision the equipment.

 I've spent most of my sys admin career in a primarily windows environment, but I've recently moved to a shop that's about 50/50. Early in my career, I was advised to never bother, and just use nano instead, which works enough like a regular text editor that anyone can use it with no special training. 
 The problem is I now catch a lot side glances from the career Linux guys for using nano. The people who have primarily worked in Linux all seem to be VI guys.
 I haven't really put effort into learning it, my vi knowledge is basically :q! If I accidentally open it.
 What do you guys think, is it actually something worth learning, or is it just a preference thing? Alternately, is it worth doing just as a marker for being a Linux pro?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a bunch of routers at remote sites that I am trying to get a rough idea of their average traffic in bps out of a certain interface based on their counters. I'm just wondering if my methodology makes sense. Obviously there are better ways to do this but I was not given the lead time to setup monitoring and gather enough data.
 First I take the counter uptime in weeks and days and calculate the total number of seconds.
 TOTAL_UPTIME_SECONDS = (((UPTIME_WEEKS * 7) + UPTIME_DAYS) * 24) * 3600 
 My goal is to get a rough idea of the usage per second. But most of this traffic is during working hours and the uptime above is 24/7. So I divide by 5 since after nights, weekends and holidays I figure the vast majority of traffic is generated in just 20% of the time
 TOTAL_WORKING_SECONDS = TOTAL_UPTIME_SECONDS / 5
 Then I calculate the number of bits from the number of bytes in the counters
 TOTAL_BITS = TOTAL_BYTES * 8
 Then I calculate the bits per second by dividing by the TOTAL_WORKING_SECONDS
 AVG_bps = TOTAL_BITS / TOTAL_WORKING_SECONDS
 Obviously this is a very rough average not taking bursts into account but I'm also taking some random 5 min average readings will pad the result. Just wondering if I went totally off-the-rails somewhere. 
 Thanks

 I am sure many of you know what KnowB4 is. For those that don't, it is a security awareness training program that helps users to take extra precautions when it come to opening emails and trickery of phishing and whatnot. 
 When we sent out a test campaign, and a user falls for it, they user will get a training class assigned to them where they'll have to watch it and take a quiz helping them not fall for it again in the future. 
 We started this about a year ago, but lately we have users who get supper offended when they fall for one the campaigns that get sent to them and get really upset that they have to do the class and quiz. It is starting to really piss me off. They're thanking we (IT) purposely are trying to make them fall for it so we can give them a shitty day. That isn't the case. We are better safe than sorry. 
 What I need help with is who can draft me a crafty email explaining how it isn't us against them and that this tool is there to help us all take extra precautions rather than feeling that IT is trying to make you fall for those tests. 
 Because as I am drafting the email, I finding it to be in a very pissed off tone which is making me hesitant to send it to the whole company. Who is good at making this email tone very firm and a**holic, but at the same time friendly? lol

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I hope somebody can help me find an answer. Unfortunately my past network architecture experience is almost a decade out of date and was with Brocade/Fastiron. We did a lot of mesh IP networks matching SAN network meshes, and it was amazing.
 I'm now in a position and we are considering using Edgecore/Wedge with CumulusLinux for a network rollout. I'm trying to figure out if its possible to do a PoD type network mesh design, but I'm coming up short as I search the internet. We haven't purchased these so we also have no support contact as of yet.
 What I have is a group of 8x racks with two switches per rack, and I'm debating what will be the best configuration to avoid or at least reduce having to do the classic multi-layer datacenter aggregation of switches to switches. We also won't be controlling the upper networks, it'll just be going directly into an ISP from within each group of 8 racks, and I want them cross-connected for faster local networking.
 If anybody knows if this is possible, thanks!
 I know I can create bridges between switches, that's fairly normal stuff. It's when you get loops even within a mesh that I'm less certain about.
 [edit]
 To clarify: What I have in mind is a classic star-mesh network from the SAN world, but in the IP world. I don't know if this is possible with this gear. It is possible with FastIron, but that might be the extent of it, and nobody else has done this sort of thing. I know Brocade was trying to push it as an open standard but after their demise maybe it just fell away.
 If not, then what is the next-ideal configuration, with 16 switches, and 2x uplinks?

 It's been a month since my internship has begun at an MSP. It's a 100% remote position and most days, I do nothing except participate to 1 to 3 useless meetings.
 Of course, I already talked to my boss about it (I would say something like "hey I have free time right now, If I can be of any help for anything please reach out to me") And when I say that, he would always ask someone in the team to call me on Teams to explain 2-3 projects they are working on, but it's useless because each time they would not give me any work to participate in these projects, they are always waiting on dependencies to be solved by someone else so I just have to wait.
 My worst issue is the daily stand up meeting where I always have to make up something to talk about.
 Do you think it's a common issue during an internship or at the beginning of a new job? I feel so bored. I was working on many exciting projects while I was a student and I miss this time so much.
 Sorry if my english is not perfect - french is my first language.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I wanted to cross post from the juniper subreddit but it seems I cannot.
 Hi all
 We have an old handmedown mx480 we barely utilize. It has a pair of 16xge cards in it now. We are planning to add another card later this year thanks to some growth.
 I didn’t realize one of those cards was damaged early on and wrecked two of the backplane slots (:() forcefully trying to get the xge card with slightly bent rear pins in. Rookie mistake. It also has only re-s-2000s in it. It seems to be doing fine now with the four full tables it gets but I know I’m pushing my luck, it runs 32 bit junos (and from what I can read, only supports up to what it runs now at 15.1), and we probably will be adding significantly more routes over next few years.
 I’d like to get something that is newer but still used and has potential for another 4-6 years of JunOS support. I’m happy with the mx480 platform and am not angling to change. Especially since if I get a newer chassis I can reuse my existing power supplies and have a spare fan module. Is the mx480- bp3 chassis with scbe2/re-s-1800x4-32g new enough to achieve that goal? Latest JunOS for a while, full tables, relatively newish.
 So far as I can tell, even the current MX isn’t stressed out at all…. I really am just thinking about the next half decade more than the now. Rather make the change now than when more people will be impacted. https://postimg.cc/GBxyfqj2
 EDIT: the big cpu spikes were me switching routing engines so I could reboot them. Four plus years uptime. Some things were acting up like a snmp poll taking 7 minutes. That’s not from normal load.

I would like costs to be in the 20 to 25 per month if possible. I'm wondering if they are other vendors in this space doing anything similar that are reputable with similar specs. Windows 11 is a must, but it does not need to connect to local resources. Essentially, a Windows desktop accessible from any standard internet-connected computer. Ideally, I don't want to host my own hardware, the environment would be desktop as a service. It may just be this is what the market is and that's fine, but I wanted to cast a wider net and make sure I'm not missing something.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[All DCs are currently W2K16, but will be swapped out for all W2K19 in a few months. All DCs support only "RC4, AES 128, AES 256" encryption types (no DES). 
 Some AD accounts (mostly computer objects for Linux systems with Centrify agent installed) support only "DES, RC4".
 Some other accounts (also Centrify systems) support "DES, RC4, AES128, AES256". The rest (vast majority Windows systems, nothing lower than W2K12R2/Win10) of accounts don't support DES at all. 
 Question 1: Without the DCs supporting for DES, is having "DES" as a supported type on a bunch of computer objects an actual risk item? We are logging everything into Splunk and there are zero events indicating DES is in use. These accounts turned up in an internal audit, but the actual risk seems non-existent. We will remediate them anyway but I'm wanting to be clear on the risk for management discussions. 
 Question 2: Right now in Splunk I see AES in use, but also RC4 being used, even involving systems that have support for AES128 and AES256. I think I've read that once we switch to W2K19 DCs this behavior will change, and the DCs will start negotiating with the highest encryption level available. Is that accurate? We want to work towards phasing out RC4, so if the above is true, we should immediately see a big drop in RC4 traffic after we swap out our DCs this summer.

 Goal: remove user from ad synced distribution list in O365 
 what I have tried: 
 Created new on prem AD user
 SMTP soft linking (proxy address attributes and email field) - this created a second account if it synced at all) 
 Hard linking by setting azure identities immutable ID to the on prem object GUID by translating it from base 64…
 The GUIDS will not throw any errors on sync, it’s the duplicate UPN and SMTP:username fields that won’t sync and show duplicate errors. 
 I thought this was possible…
 Last idea - export PST and remake.

 We have a AD on-prem server with multiple domain-names split per OU. We would like to set-up sync
 through AADConnect so that each OU gets its own Tenant sync.
 Do I have this right that I have to install one AADConnect per Tenant to make this happen? We have maybe 30 OU/domains to be potentially synced to individual Tenants. If this is the case do I need 30 instances of AADConnect? This does not sound right? But if this is the case what is best practices?
 Let me know if I have to clarify things. Thanks.

 It's common knowledge that switches forward broadcast/multicast Ethernet frames out on every port except on the one the frame was received on. This is described e.g. in Computer Networks: A Systems Approach Chapter 3.2.4
 However even though I have fulltext access to IEEE standards, my brain hurts when I try to understand how exactly this behaviour can be deducted from 802.1d, not to speak of 802.1Q. 
 Could someone point me to the relevant portions in the standards where exactly this is derived from?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've had a phishing campaign target users within our company, all the usual markers aren't present, so this hasn't been quarantined by our Email Gateway.
 Pretty much, each email sent comes from a different mail server (all "good / neutral" reputation), they're all different in content, but all have a "*.pdf" attached (no set naming scheme to these either).
 Each of the emails only goes to a few users so isn't being caught via "bulk" sending either. Obviously we've been adding the mail servers into the block lists along with the domains as they come in.
 We've had KnowBe4 running campaigns for years now, so our end users knew what to do (don't open anything, report it, etc.). We sent out an email to all users, just informing them of what is happening, and to be vigilant.
 I don't think much more can be done to prevent this, other than keep up training for users, keep them informed of threats (as we've done).
 All the mail servers aren't within our country and we don't do much business outside of this country, so I could restrict all inbound mail just to our country (then just allow through what's need when it's needed).
 I have got a support case open with our Email Gateway provider, as a few of these emails used the name of end users and should of been caught by "Impersonation Prevention" but it marked them as "Legitimate".
 Any suggestions? Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks

 We already have problem dates coming up quick, virgin media will turn off all phone lines supplied by pstn copper in July this year, then in October all EoFTTC and EFM products we get from Zen are disconnected, and then there is the simple stop sales like no standard DSL or FTTC from September. The new products SoGEA does not cover all sites, if you had a line that was DSL only you might be out of luck, and nothing comes with the SLA of EoFTTC or EFM without doubling the cost and going fibre leased line.
 I wonder what people are doing? Personally anything voice we are just shunting to mobile 3G/LTE, the data is going to have to be SoGEA, but we have already identified areas where the service level is reduced or simply no current replacement product meets the same spec.
 It's all flipping annoying 😔

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, 
 I am in need of some assistance with a project I am working on. I have been tasked with creating an automatic warranty checker for Dell servers, and I am hoping to use Nagios to achieve this. I have found an API for Nagios that was created in 2012, but unfortunately, it is no longer functional. I was wondering if anyone here has any experience with creating a Dell server warranty checker using Nagios and would be able to offer any guidance.
 The objective of this project is to create a system that will allow Nagios to self-check the Dell website by service tag and display the warranty status of the server in Nagios, or alternatively, send an email notification. This would help us keep track of the warranty status of our servers and allow us to take action before the warranty expires.
 I would appreciate any help or guidance on this matter, whether it be through pointing me in the direction of helpful resources, providing suggestions on how to tackle this project, or sharing personal experiences with similar projects.
 Thank you in advance for your assistance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an Ansible playbook that can modify the VLAN configuration of Cisco switch ports. Here's an example of the host_vars:
 interface:
 GigabitEthernet1/0/1:
 mode: trunk
 GigabitEthernet1/0/2:
 access_vlan: '100'
 mode: access
 voice_vlan: '200'
 stp_portfast: enable
 GigabitEthernet1/0/3:
 access_vlan: '100'
 mode: access
 voice_vlan: '200'
 stp_portfast: enable
 ...
 Here's the task, which works well and allows me to configure the ports by calling the 'port' tags:
 - name: assign access port
 cisco.ios.ios_l2_interfaces:
 config:
 - name: "{{item.key}}"
 mode: "{{item.value.mode | default (omit)}}"
 access:
 vlan: "{{item.value.access_vlan | default (omit)}}"
 voice:
 vlan: "{{ item.value.voice_vlan | default (omit) }}"
 state: merged
 with_dict: "{{ interface }}"
 when: (item.value.mode is defined and item.value.mode == 'access')
 tags:
 - port
 Let's say I want to make changes to G1/0/30. I can make the changes in host_vars, and run the play, however, as you know in Ansible, it will go through each port, validate them, and eventually make changes to G1/0/30. 
 The problem here is that it takes a long time to configure a single port, If I have a stack switch, can't even imagine, it will take forever.
 The time it takes to configure a single port using SSH CLI now takes no longer in ansible, which defeats the whole purpose of automation. This will get even trickier during a troubleshooting calls.
 So if anyone who has successfully used Ansible in their network, do you know how to deal with this situation?
 I am looking for a solution where I can invoke the playbook for only the specific interface. without so much change

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, so I have a little chart I'm creating (for my own reference) that estimates one-way & round-trip latency based on mileage. I'm aware in long-distance networks, propogation delay is based around the speed of light (1ms of latency per 125km, *when traveling over physical media). However, the figures I'm observing in real-life are higher than would be suggested by this.
 Example: The RTT between New York and San Francisco should theoretically be around 48ms. However, the actual figures observed are closer to 70ms.
 With this in mind, where is the attentional latency coming from, and is there a good "rule of thumb" multiplier that I can use to estimate latency? I'm aware that serialization & processing delay is a thing, but given today's interface speeds, I can't see how that could possibly add up to anything significant. Does the added latency come from the fiber optic medium itself? The fact that light is not traveling in a vacuum? Some sort of operation on the ROADMS?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there fellow networkers! I am running into a particular issue that I am researching a better solution. I am primarily a PON engineer so I am used to working in that space but as my ISP that I work for is transitioning away from Active E setups, besides for enterprise customers, and moving more to XGS-PON for connections, I am running into an issue with MDUs, mainly apartment complexes. 
 ​
 We install a 48 port L2 switch then through the CLI, apply traffic shapers accordingly to what the customer is paying for on that interface instead of installing a managed router or some kind of CPE equipment. This is great and all being fed from a Active E connection or even now a XGS ONT since the apartment complex doesn't want to run fiber to all the units and want to re-utilize all the copper connections so we install a managed switch. So far this works for a dedicated NOC tech to turn up or down or apply different traffic shapers to the interface but that generates a lot of tickets for work that I don't want them doing all day long but I can't necessarily teach the customer service or billing people to do those tasks. 
 ​
 Now we do run UNMS/UISP because we use it for managing GPON ONUs via UOLT, ERX, Air Cubes and other Ubiquiti products but I keep seeing stuff about the UISP Switch Pro being able to apply Traffic Shaper profiles and turn up/down interfaces with ease. Before I order one for testing, is it just as easy with the new CRM system to create a customer, apply a service plan and assign a port interface just in a similar fashion as the GPON ONUs? If so, that would alleviate a lot of manual work!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I wanted to know what everyone's thoughts were on these three backup solutions. The company in question has over 20,000 employees and currently uses CommVault which can be very difficult to manage well. A lot of the general work is spent on maintenance and using tickets with CV to get things done. 
 The other part of the question is which solution would work with Salesforce the best. CommVault really lacks in features for SF and isn't even on the app exchange. I know cohesity just got a partnership with Ownbackup so that is good and something we are considering. 
 But from everyone's experiences what would be the recommendation?

 -Would like to be able to have a one "head end" device that could go into the facility network and then multiple endpoint devices for the different devices on the current 485 loop
 If this is possible with MoCa, what would be a good recommendation? Any Ideas would be appreciated

 The Lord's Security Engineer's Prayer:
  
Our security engineer, who art in the server room,
 Hallowed be thy firewall.
 Thy authentication come,
 Thy audits be done,
 In the cloud, as it is on-premise. 
 Give us this day our daily encryption,
 And forgive us our security breaches,
 As we forgive those who breach our PII.
 Lead us not into compliance failures,
 But deliver us from cyber threats. 
 For thine is the network, the power,
 And the glory, of ranch,
 Forever and ever. 
 Access granted.

 It's me that asked you to support your service, foolishly thinking that you would do something to take care of your customer.
 It's me that needed to know when your service was going to have scheduled downtime, and had the nerve to ask for notifications ahead of time. In over 4 years I've never received a notice for a single planned outage - despite asking repeatedly.
 It's me that has opened over 100 support tickets with you for various failures in your service in the last 6 months. 
 It's me that is tired of being grilled by the execs, wondering when I'm going to be done giving you 2nd, 3rd, 47th, and 184th chances.
 It's me, Bluepeak Communications, that's sick of your horseshit telco network, and your abject failure to support your customers. But it's you who is going to lose a big customer because you don't seem to give a damn when we tell you something's wrong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I’m in an odd situation here. I’ve spent the last 15 years of my life buried in the CLI to become the best network engineer I could. I got my BS degree (bullshit degree I call it), I got my CCNA r/S, CCNA Voice, CCNP r/S, and I’m working to renew it into an CCNP Enterprise…. But I’m burnt out. 
 I work so much that it’s crumbled my personal/family life. I’ve also grown into an alcoholic over the years. I’ve worked the 12 step program but with the stress of my job – I keep going back to the boos. It’s time to make a change. 
 So I’ve been putting out apps for jobs that I’m essentially overqualified for – main reason is so I can go to work and not have to stress. I can set up a VLAN instead of design a whole VXLAN from scratch. I can make sure the link lights are up – instead of delve into the CLI for 3 hours trying to troubleshoot things down to the packet level… At least – this is my plan. 
 I have a final interview for a NOC 3 position. The pay is surprisingly good for a NOC job and based off what I learned in my second interview – this job should be a breeze. 
 So my strange question is – has anyone taken a step BACK from the hard charge “study everyday” mentality? If so – did it help your personal life? What’s it like working in the NOC from the perspective of a more senior guy? I ask because most NOC techs I’ve worked with were early career (justifiably so). I’ve never worked in a NOC but everywhere I’ve worked has had one – so I’m familiar with most duties. 
 I’m doing this to save my marriage, personal life, and get my shit back together – and I’m blessed in that the paycut is not all that bad since I’ll be a t3… No they haven’t given me an offer but I told them my bottom line number and they still called me back 1 hour later to do the final interview.

 We enabled notification when emails are quarantined, and staff will have an option to "Review Message," "Request Release" and "Block Sender." We will get notified and have two ways of releasing the quarantined emails.
 ​
 Release
  
- This option will have an option to "Submit the message to Microsoft to improve detection (false positive)
 - Allow emails with similar attributes (URL, senders, etc.)
 - then you specify the "Remove allow entry" to 1, 7, 30 days, or a specific date
  
Approve release
  
- selecting this option "will send the message to Microsoft for analysis and evaluation."
  
It doesn't matter which option we select. Even adding to the safe-sender lists, valid emails are getting blocked. Are you experiencing the same issue with MS O365 Defender? Any suggestions? Any feedback is greatly appreciated. Thanks

 Hoping someone has a solid suggestion for a 10GB SFP switch I can use for backend traffic between our production ESXi servers (Q#2) and PAC (SAN storage. The Cisco unit that was quoted to us came in way too expensive ( Cisco Catalyst 9300X ) so hoping to hear other suggestions we can look into. Thanks in advance!

I come from a federal background where we had to have MFA on everything, and it didn't matter if we were on the internal network or accessing the network remotely. However at my new organization (which handles mostly banking clients) it seems the overall trend is no MFA for internal access to the domain, but only if the user is working remotely. Is this common? Is this best practice? I feel like MFA should be configured for external and internal but maybe I'm biased? What do you think?

We need further discussion to talk about kinds of access, and we discussed reasons for limiting how many people can make changes to SharePoint sites. 
 Overall, the in-person discussion went well, and I feel like this is back under control. 
 I appreciate everyone who had a thoughtful comment and offered good suggestions
 Original Post:
 This request came in yesterday. I told them we can't do that, but I'm still getting pressure. I've asked them what they're trying to do and exactly what kind of access they want, but that giving the HR director access to folders that could contain customer PII is a non-starter. The COO just changed the request to all Operations sites, which seems OK for the COO, but still not HR. 
 I've cited potential fine, lawsuits, and failing third-party investor due-diligence IT audits. 
 I have an informal meeting with them today and will hopefully get some insight into their goals, but as of now I have no idea why they want HR to have this access.
 Any thoughts?

 How do you handle accounts in your warehouses with people that are very very computer illiterate? I just went through our AD and we have about... 37 shared accounts.
 I am lost on how to transition these users to using their own logins due to how many people can use a single station - I'm most stuck on users not knowing how to switch accounts using the 'other accounts' option on the Windows logon screen.
 I've been at this new place for about 3 months, and while I am working on transitioning to running the department myself (currently just me and my boss who's transitioning to another field), my main goal during this first year is to clean things up and implement best practices. 
 Part of me wants to ask if there's ever any situation where shared accounts are okay, but at the end of the day there's 0 accountability if something happens on one of these computers.
 How do you guys handle these? KIOSK mode? Print out instructions at workstations on switching accounts?

One of the first things I noticed was that some of our locations had a firewall, while some of them did not. I got a firewall installed and site to site VPN set up at all our locations. Recently I became aware that some of our sites have a wireless network for tenants to use though the site's ISP. My first reaction is to remove all ISP wireless and setup a managed wireless infrastructure at each location.
 Am I overacting by adding firewalls with site to site VPN at all our locations and wanting to have all wireless networks at our locations be managed and using the same equipment that we use on our corporate wireless? Any idea of why they would not use firewalls at all locations? How would you handle the tenant wireless infrastructure?
 I am a team of 1 at my company and the person I took over for was not a technical person.

 We are having an issue where someone from, for example, 'john@superawesomeclient.com' sends an email to a distribution list, for example 'groupemail@fantasticclient.co.za' which I and a few others on 'myowndomain.com' (hosted on microsoft 365) are a member of, we wont get that message but john@superawesomeclient.com will get a NDR it will have this
  
Error DetailsError:550 5.7.360 Remote server returned message denied by administrative policy -> 550 Administrative prohibition - envelope blocked - https://community.mimecast.com/docs/DOC-1369#550 [ZgnzmELwMCC9bjqMvfWALQ.za9]Message rejected by:za-smtp-1.mimecast.co.za
  
Now other people on 'superawesomeclient.com' and 'fantasticclient.co.za' domains can send emails to me and others in my domain I get them no problem, but its is emails from 'groupemail@fantasticclient.co.za' is where my issue lays.
 Both the mentioned domains are on my 'allowed list', and I have both of those domains setup to bypass the built-in spam filters. I have even set the all the Mimecast server ip's (for South Africa that is) in my 'IP Allow list' from on our 'Connection filter Policy', but still emails from just the one account (groupemail@fantasticclient.co.za) by anyone on my domain (myowndomain.com).
 ​
 How can I go about resolving this and what would I need to show the people at 'fantasticclient.co.za' and their domain is 'whitelisted' so to speak if this is their issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're investigating using EVPN-BGP in our data center (100-200 servers, thousands of VMs in Openstack). Although I personally have been in the networking industry for awhile as a software engineer, I am going to need to heavily ramp up on BGP in general and try to learn these technologies from the ground up.
 Wondering with those that have some experience here whether setting these scenarios up in Eve-NG is possible/effective or whether just jumping into setting up the physical hardware is a better option.
 Appreciate any guidance here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need some help commenting, analyzing, and criticizing different queuing models for some IoT interactions.
 ​
 Using the simulator MobileJINQS with support of the ON/OFF model, assuming that each ON/OFF model represented a mobile sender that uses various QoS settings for the transmission of messages and followed 4 experiments:
 ​
  
ON/OFF Model
  
* The server remains in the ON and OFF states for exponentially distributed time periods T_ON = T_OFF = 20 / 40 / 60s;
 * Messages get processed with a mean service demand D=0.125s
 * Messages arrive to the queue with a mean rate lambda varying from 0.05 to 4 messages/sec.
 This is the simulated curve of the mean response time for several lambda rates:
 ​

 ​
  
ON/OFF Model with QoS Features
  
* T_ON=T_OFF=20s
 * Mean service demand D=0.125s
 * Message arrival rate lambda varies from 0.05 to 3.9 messages/sec.
 ​
 On that basis, we had four experiments on, considering these QoS features:
 (1) Tau = 1, lifetime = infinity, and K = infinity
 (2) Tau = 1, lifetime = 30s, and K = infinity
 (3) Tau = 0.75, lifetime = infinity, and K = infinity
 (4) Tau = 1, lifetime = infinity, and K = 100
 ​
 For each of the four experiments, the ON/OFF model was run 10 times and we got the following curve, response time with respect to arrival rate lambda:
 ​

 ​
 As well as sucess rate with respect to arrival rate:
 ​
 https://i.imgur.com/qF35p07.png
 ​
  
Nonpreemptive priority and multiclass simulation model
  
​
 K classes were defined with different arrival lambda_k and service rates mu_k for each class.
 ​
 Depending on the values of lambda_k and mu_k, the system can be saturated.
 ​
 Let p be the server utilization. The queue remains unsaturated when p < 1.
 ​
 We got the curvers of different server utilization, first one was p=0.69 and classes C=19; and second was p=0.89 and classes C=9
 ​

 It would be much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you plan to move towards passwordless via smart cards, passwords are still required for initial onboarding plus the users may need to access certain things via their AD credentials that don’t support smart card authentication.
 It would not be practical for the users to have to call the help desk every time they need to access something via password and, if they have a known password always available to them, it defeats some of the security of using a smart card since the smart card authentication can be bypassed if the password is compromised.
 What are you doing to give SCRIL users password access for onboarding and to authenticate to resources that don’t recognize smart cards?

 It appears that the main advantage of Cloud Trust is that it allows you to deploy while avoiding requiring having a PKI in your environment. If your environment stills needs a PKI for other reasons, that advantage goes away.
 Doesn’t key trust have better RDP compatibility and also allows you to use “run as” where you cannot with cloud trust?

 Two days ago some of them notified me that the print preview takes literally ages to load. I stayed after work to check and it not only takes more than two minutes to load but it also crashes chrome 1/3 times.
 I scraped the internet for a solution and tried a bunch of stuff and ended up fixing it by manually installing new Post script drivers on all 10 machines for all 3 office printers.
 The preview now works without crashing Chrome but it still takes about 5 seconds to load (a big improvement over the 2 minutes it used to take). Naturally everyone is still complaining because according to them it used to be instantaneous before.
 Im all out of ideas here so any tips would be really appreciated. One option is obviously to just use another browser but it’s an unpopular option as “they’re all really used to chrome and how it looks”
 Pls help.

 And I have been noticing when I push the system to do heavy tasks that the CPU performance at 90% CPU load across all threads hovers around 3.45Ghz, I never see it hit 3.60Ghz or its boost of 3.90Ghz. 
 The bios settings are set to default, Speedstep and TurboBoost are enabled and the bios is on the latest version. 
 I wonder if its a Dell thing or a Microsoft Windows 11 thing?

 I see I can make myself powershell script and scheduled task, but all I want is having daily snapshots for the last 5 days.
 >inb4 do b backups
 They are done both of important data inside and of the entire VMs with veeam.
 But I just want daily snapshots to have bit of extra automated "backup" when I am updating stuff inside, knowing I can do so without extra step of doing snapshot beforehand. Which is easier and faster to revert to than backups.

 im a bit stuck and could need some input from you:
 We have a Windows Server 2016 RDS. Since last Week users complaining that they cant open some PDF Files. I got the ticket now from my colleague to help him.
 I analyzed the problem and found that all files that wont work have the DataStream ZoneIdentifier tag set that they are from the internet and could harm the system. If i rightclick the file it show the info box "this file came from another computer and might be blocked to help protect this computer".
 So far so good. If i click on allow and therefore remove the Zone Identifier the File opens with a double click. 
 I checked other file types aswell. The same Problem with word files, and image files. So its not a application problem. It seems to be a windows problem.
 If i change the internetoptions-> security -> Internet Zone -> Start unsecure applications and files : from confirm (recommended) -> to activate (not secure) the problem is gone also. But i dont like to change this setting.
 What could cause this problem? Can you help me?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[With the 2012R deadline approaching I upgraded everything to 2022, and rebuilt out DC's in the process. I was ready to decommission the final 2012R2 DC but when testing via a shutdown, I experienced an outage. 
 Our intranet, hosted on Google Cloud on Ubuntu, requires a sign in with an active directory credential to access (email address + password via LDAP). Despite changing the IP of the VM's DNS server to match our new DC's (one on GCP and one on prem), the moment I turn off the old DC is the moment authentication on this server fails, and staff instead get an "Internal Server Error" page from apache. 
 Digging into the apache config, I can see the authentication is using LDAP, with the following section;
 ## Active Directory AuthBasicProvider ldap AuthLdapBindDN readonly@int.domain.net AuthLdapBindPassword AuthLdapBindURL ldap://int.domain.net:3268/?userPrincipleName?sub 
 Three things about this;
 1 - Even though the AD account it's using to authenticate has the absolute minimum access, I don't like how the password is stored in plain text. Is this a requirement for such a setup?
 2 - What configures that ldap:// and how do I get it to point to the new DC's? Is this configured vía our public DNS instead? Or is not DNS at all?? 
 3 - Doing some digging online I discovered that it's possible to "automatically authenticate" via their user account if the credentials match (meaning they don't have to enter them in). Is this only possible on Windows/will it break a manual username/password entry? We have some Macs around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After some recent less than desirable experiences at my job, I reached out to a recruiter. They have passed along a job opportunity to be the IT Manager at a Non Profit for me to look at. I would be the sole IT person onsite and the description lists everything from on boarding new employees for training to writing and implementing policy. Apparently there is a significant level of vendors leveraged right now, but it still seems as though the job might be punching a bit above it's weight class in terms of expectations and salary. The network size is approximately 100 end user devices according to the recruiter (computers). 
 What are people's experiences working in an environment like this? Is there a chance it could be good? Or will it be an extremely overworked shit show? 
 I will also add I have previously been a network admin and systems engineer and feel as though my only weak point skillset wise will be the HIPPA stuff. I do have experience working in a heavily controlled and audited environment so I think it will be more so based around learning the new intricacies VS entirely new concepts. In the listing they specifically call out that they will send people to training to ensure their skillset stays sharp. 
 The salary is more than livable (85k) as it will be a great resume builder and it's similiar to my current role as an engineer. I wouldn't be taking a pay cut.

 User logs in, 802.1x auth occurs with user’s account (EXAMPLE\jdoe) and EX3400 dhcp process deletes the existing DHCP binding, resulting in Windows machine getting a new IP address.
 Desired behavior is no IP change.
 This only occurs when the machine is directly connected to the switch running dhcp-local-server. When machine is connected to an EX3400 switch trunked to the switch providing DHCP, this does not occur, as the DHCP process has no awareness of the auth change.
 Any ideas of how to get dhcp-local-server to ignore 802.1x auth events?

 Only problem is that I also didn't enable telnet or SSH...
 There's a reset button that doesnt appear to be able to wipe this thing back to factory settings, or it doesn't disclose the additional steps needed to do so in the docs.
 How are the 1k's able to beset if CLI is not an option? I'm not a hardcore network guy, I mostly deal with Meraki gear... so sorry if this is a dumb question

 I don't know, but when I see these unless its a tiny company I feel like either the company is behind the times and doesn't want to upgrade, too cheap to buy its own domain or the IT department gave up a long time ago trying to make any changes to the company.
 ​
 It always makes me hesitant to apply for these companies.
 Anybody else get that feeling or am I just paranoid ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Situation:
 ServerA <-> FW <- IPSec VPN -> FW (NAT) <==> public internet
 Issue: some clients have connection issues with ServerA , apparently only when sending larger files. The public IP address is NATted on the first firewall.
 When a Linux client enables mtu probing (echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_mtu_probing ), there are no issues.
 So it is some kind of MTU issue. I ran a couple of ping tests from a client, and I am getting weird results:
 ​
  
 ping -s <size> <ip address> ping -D -s (size> <ip address> 
  
 64: OK 64: OK 
  1394: OK 1394: OK 
  1395: No ICMP reply 1395: NO ICMP reply 
  1396: No ICMP reply 1396: NO ICMP reply 
  1397: OK 1397: NO ICMP reply 
  1464: OK 1464: NO ICMP reply 
  1465: OK 1465: fragmentation needed (Code 4 reply) 
  1472: OK 1472: fragmentation needed (Code 4 reply) 
  1473: No ICMP reply 1473: message too long ( ping: sendto: Message too long ) ; probably from OS, don't see anything in Wireshark 
  1495: No ICMP reply (Wireshark: Fragmented IP protocol) 1495: message too long 
 
 When initiating a TCP connection to ServerA, serverA responds with a MSS of 1384 .
 Downloading a 10.000 bytes file from ServerA works as expected.
 Can any point me in the right direction where to look ? ServerA isn't in our control and is difficult to get any traces from. On the left FW there are no rules, it only terminates the VPN connection. The right side of the VPN and its FW is in our control and allows some tcp-ports and ICMP. MTU size of the interfaces on the FW are 1500.
 Especially the difference in behaviour around size 1397, where normal pings suddenly start working again until 1473. This differs per connection, on my normal home wifi I see above behaviour, when connecting to a 4G hotspot (either tethered or via wifi to a 4G router), there are no ICMP replies from 1395 onwards. And pings with DF-bit set never return the Code 4 reply, so that might be filtered in 4G networks.

 Best practices are certainly not being followed and I'm just now digging into how to get us to a good spot. I've recently enabled URL and Application monitoring for our lan to wan policy. App monitoring is requesting deep inspection, but it seems the impact of doing so must be considered.
 - Any advice for whether to enable deep inspection or not?
 - Should antivirus be enabled on our lan-to-wan policy with out-of-the-box defaults? What about DNS filter?
 - Can I setup alerts to fire when a "monitored" category URL is hit? Or can you only fire alerts on a blocked URL?
 What would be your recommendations if you had a "new" Fortigate firewall dropped in your lap? I'm willing to consider some of the subscriptions Fortinet offers, such as Forticloud/Fortianalyzer, if the value is there.
 The current goal is to increase visibility into user activity. We don't regularly monitor, but in the event we want to check on someone's activity, we want that ability. Right now I'm struggling to glean meaningful info from our App/URL monitoring and can't find a way to filter by categories (such as adult categories or suspicious/blocked URLs).
 I'm going to be taking this one step at a time, so any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

Everything sounded like a lot of added value for no cost (since AT&T pays them directly). Is this too good to be true? Someone will help me manage all my AT&T woes and I don't have to pay a penny? What are the pros/cons? Interested to hear your experience.
 Edit: an AT&T Solutions Provider (not Service, my mistake) is different than AT&T itself. This is someone who works as a middle man between you and AT&T. It’s like they know AT&T is such a PITA to work with and they help you navigate that. Anyone have experience with that? I know AT&T is horrible to work with. Trust me, I know! That’s why I’m wondering if this service would be worth it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi /r/networking
 I'm working with a client that's exploring options for SASE and SDWAN for around 200 branch sites. They don't run redundant internet circuits at the majority of these sites, so I have steered them away from expensive SDWAN solutions to accompany their SASE purchase; I don't see any value in branch SDWAN appliances if they are single-circuit for the foreseeable future.
 My question is: has anyone out there found a relatively low cost, IPSec capable, cloud-managed router with some level of enterprise support available? A good low touch provisioning workflow would be a big bonus as well. These devices would strictly be used to feed traffic from branch sites into the selected SASE solution via IPSec tunnel. We would either do a static default on the branch routers, or distribute a default via an IGP. The SASE solution will double as their WAN in this case, for branch-to-branch connectivity.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Since COVID and the new hybrid workplace, I've seen a lot of turnover in many enterprises.
 Often times, senior network engineers move on and are replaced with junior engineers who lack experience and foundational knowledge. Other times, senior engineers are replaced with new senior engineers who have the background knowledge, but need to learn the company-specific implementations. 
 I'm looking for ideas on how to skill-up these new hires, and wondering what others feel are some of the best methods? 
 A few things I've found to work:
 Shadowing/Co-Piloting changes - Junior shadows the senior on a change, then junior takes the wheel and senior co-pilots the change. This is sort of like the "I do/we do/you do" concept in education.
 Good documentation/topologies/reference materials - Having plans of the network topology, where to find things, etc.
 Leveraging TAC - Pass off issues that require the involvement of TAC can help learn basic troubleshooting commands
 Trial by fire - Throw to the wolves on resolving tickets, etc. Basically sink or swim.
 ​
 ​
 Does your organization do anything special to ramp up new hires? For example, a Wiki or handbook or something that goes over all the different equipment you use with reference configs and topologies? Do you put new engineers through 3rd party training?
 Or do you mostly rely on their previous experience and expect on-the-job training to cover the rest?

 I get lots of different projects thrown at me and I’m feeling overwhelmed but I want to grow my career. 
 I’ve written two applications that the company uses daily and made our business flow much faster. I’ve implemented a ticketing system, enrolled field user devices with inTune, working on migrating our ERP to be cloud based, fully took over helpdesk, comfortable with Active Directory and GPOs, set them up with SharePoint, on-boarded all devices with defender ATP, and more. 
 Now they know that I can program pre chatGPT, they want me to make these other complicated business applications. All while I’m trying to earn my admin title.
 Not sure what to focus on and I’ve mentioned that IT admin and programmer are two full time jobs. I prefer sys admin over programming any day. 
 I can probably cruise here and learn a lot on the sys admin side but I’m by myself and feel like an imposter when talking to the MSP some days. 
 Anyone else in a similar boat? Is one year experience enough to apply elsewhere? Do I keep on keeping on and rely on MSP if I’m an idiot?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this is a little off topic but hopefully some folks here have worked in hardware or done their own home labs before:
 I am being offered some retired server equipment (that I very much want!) and a half-height mobile server rack/cart thing. Any advice on the best way to transport it? 
 The server rack cart will fit in my SUV if it's on its side, but that's only reasonable if it's empty. The server equipment (including a nice rack-mount UPS) is quite heavy and will fill the cart, I don't imagine that could reasonably be lifted even with 4 people (and probably not ideal to have that stuff laying on its side?).
 I have a trailer with a ramp I could borrow, but the trailer has like a whopping 2 leaf-springs of suspension so anything in there would be bounced and rattled like crazy for my 1-hour drive home over shitty roads.
 I can borrow a pickup truck, but how to get the loaded cart up into the truck? (There is no lift onsite, I have a tractor at home and could easily unload it, but getting it into the truck is a challenge). 
 Short of renting a UHaul, any ideas? Thanks in advance!

 Long time lurker, first time asking for some help.
 Our company has started offering customers SAML as a login method recently. Naturally I was tasked with setting it up customers, because I have a lot of spare time as the only IT Admin for a company of 250 users. /s
 We (Service Provider) use Okta, customers vary between Google Workspace, Okta, Azure AD for IdP. I've got no issue setting up Okta or Google Workspace customers, I use those daily, got 'em covered, but Azure is where I am struggling. I figured out how to set up a SAML app, and it's working with a SP initiated flow, but user attributes aren't mapping which long term will cause issues. All I get is their email, but also need to get firstName and lastName to map.
 If anyone could direct me on how to properly map attributes from Azure AD to Okta via SAML it would be greatly appreciated!
 ​
 On a side note, I am creating documentation on how to set everything up on both our and customer side and got approval from my manager and the CSM manager that once documentation is ready, this will become CSM responsibility.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning everyone!
 I was doing some research on IT companies in my local area and came across a job at a company called Unisys. The pay for the work seems very good, requires traveling to customers to repair computer hardware and troubleshoot primarily Dell computers at ~$24/hr plus mileage. The majority of the support appears to be based out of Asia, but the position requires work local to where I live. 
 I've seen mixed reviews online with people saying that it is an MSP company, and it should not be worked with while others say that it is good pay and experience with hard work. I currently make $18/hr full time, but I am looking to branch into the field of IT. This seems like a good opportunity for me, but I need some 2nd opinions. 
 Has anyone here worked with Unisys in the past? If so, what was your experience like working for them? Would you recommend them?

Total production nightmare recreating permissions, shares etc. Finally got everything working again yesterday and a little sleep.
 Today, a different set of servers is showing the same symptoms. All of the sudden administrators are unable to access the admin shares on remote servers. I am at a loss and could really use some advice.

 The new office will connect by Wireless WAN to the main office WiFi network and have their own LAN and wifi there(separate business). There will be just a couple of workstations, two printers and mobile phones.

 I assume these routers should have two WiFi adapters in order to accommodate two different WiFI tasks? Is anything else I need to be aware of? Also if you have models to suggest that would be highly appreciated.

 Is there anything that can check against a constantly updated database of compromised passwords (and is also easy to deploy) without the administrator having to download a huge file of hashes every time to update it?
 This is for on-prem AD obvsiouly. We are also putting into place Azure AD Password Protection for Windows Server as well, but in my testing, I've noticed some passwords it would accept that Netwrix found in the compromised database, so would still like something that can do a check against leaked passwords.

 If this isn’t an appropriate question for this sub - sorry.
 Recently I was tasked to create a registry for gear such as keyboards, desktop docks, and perhaps even ergo mouse pads due to the fact that many of these items tend to walk away. The issue is that these stationary items are at desks in a hybrid environment where the employees book their desk on a week by week basis. Normally I would just have everyone sign for their issue. But that’s not feasible with this work arrangement. 
 Not really sure what to do to make users accountable in this environment. 
 Any recommendations?

 I'm not sure if this is the most accurate sub to post this on but I couldn't really find an active sub that was more closely related. 
 At my work, I need to create (with the help of a few others) a range of computers to test cyber threat emulation and defense on. The budget for this range is exactly $0 and we have to just use a bunch of old laptops we have lying around. This kind of throws virtualizing all of the devices out as an option. Currently, we plan to run the exploits which will infect all of the laptops and then manually re-install Windows on each one, this is super time-consuming so I'm trying to think of how we can do this in a more automated way.
 I've never done anything like this before and it is also way outside of the scope of my job but it's gotta get done. Some thoughts I've had is having a virtual machine on top of the host machine that we create a snapshot of and somehow make the connection within the network only reach the VM rather than the host machine.
 Does anyone have any advice or can point me in the right direction for how I can get started with this?

How do I make this available for all machines?
 Does it have to be set locally or when I set them up?
 Currently we have an admin account on the machine, but obviously it had been wiped by the senior user
 Would this other user option give us the way to remove the old style admin account?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As most of us know - or will get to know soon enough, unlocking security features with some software vendors, are usually locked behind extremely high price tags.
 As per default, if you want to add a piece of software, and want to be compliant with just the basic GDPR or ISAE on security, the "enterprise"-license is the only way forward.
 With cyberattacks being one of the largest threats to organizations, should these features not by law, be included in even the smallest level of licensing?
 I manage quite a few licenses for a medium size company, and everyone who have tried to enlighten management about why we should pay for the Porche instead of the Fiat (no flame), knows how hard you sometimes have to fight and fail for that. Even given the possible security risks it entails.
 What are your thoughts on the subject, in terms of making it a law instead of a moneysink? Would it be possible? What would be the argument for it not happening? What would be the punchline that sold it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks,
 I need your help with something. I want to set up a Teams channel where my colleagues can vote daily for our lunch spot. This process seems to take about an hour a day and its really hurting productivity.
 What's the best way to make this happen automatically? I'm open to using Teams, Outlook add-ins, excel macro, Power Automate flows, or bots - whatever works best. 
 Also, I want to keep track of who's voted and share the results in an Excel file. Any suggestions on how to make that happen?
 Some of the methods i tried were using voting bots in MS Teams, but haven't found any which meets my needs: - export results to file so we can add orders to same files and keep track of money flow.
 I also tried creating re-occurring flow in which MS Teams connected with MS Forms file, but that proven to be impossible for me.
 Thanks for your help, and looking forward to your suggestions!

 So my business finally requires some techs to be on call during afterhours. Most of the time they just need to be on call incase our app server goes down/network issues. nothing to do 99% of the time. I have been doing thing myself and have taken maybe 3 calls in the last 6 months, but Im not about to ask other techs todo this so I want to pay them and add it to their contract.
 I was thinking a lower flat rate and then a higher rate per call. What would be a fair $ amount for the flat rate and then higher rate per call in the industry in the moment?
 Am in Australia, Sydney
 Thanks in advance

 I'm 8 years on the networking field at a European service provider, I gain quite a lot of experience during this time, did CCNP, CCNA Security, JNCIA, Silver Peak certifications and now working with Juniper's CSO and SSR SD-WAN solutions. 
 To be honest in the last 3 years I didn't became a fan of SDWAN nor did I got interested in the Cloud Solutions. Lately I have some free time and I would like to learn new things and do some certifications, but I'm not sure which way to go. 
 From one side I'm planning to do a Linux certification: I have general knowledge I picked up during my work, but it would be nice to have a more in-depth understanding in the system. I think it's still the foundation of IT. Which certification would you recommend? CompTIA or LPI?
 From the networking side, first I was thinking going for a Cisco or Juniper certification, but then I found Wireshark exam. Every now and then we hit problems where packet analysis is necessary and I only have basic knowledge in that, but once the data is gathered by others it's fun to solve the issue by completely understanding the traffic behavior. 
 So I did check this WCNA certification, but to be honest it feels a bit like an abandoned exam. The books are outdated and their website as well. What is your opinion on WCNA?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 We have been having some issues lately with outlook losing connection for some people in the company. It just sometimes loses connection randomly, and it's not really something people notice right away, so sometimes an e-mail will just be stuck for a whole day. So a lot of people have swapped to browser since the issue does not seem to appear there.
 Some more info on the issue.
 There can be days between occurrence
 It seems the only way to fix this is restarting the pc.
 Multiple people are impacted (Two guys with completely new workstations)
 ​
 I've tried all the common fixes.
 Check Connectivity and Mailbox Server Status. The first thing to do is check your system's network status.
 Check Work Offline Status.
 Restart Outlook in Safe Mode
 Fix Certificate Issue
 Create New Outlook Profile.
 Rebuild Outlook Data File.
 ​
 I've been going through a SaRA Advanced Diagnostic file and found this event log. I was thinking the credentials being rejected might be causing some of the issues.
 The BITS service provided job credentials in response to the UNIDENTIFIED authentication challenge from the Outlook.office365.com server for the microsoft Outlook offline address book xxxxxxxxxxxx transfer job that is associated with the following URL:/OAB/xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx/oab.xml. The credentials for the S-1-5-21-xxxxxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx-xxxxxx-xxxxxxxxxx user were rejected.
 ​
 If anyone has had this issue before, or might know a fix. Please guide me. All help is appreciated.
 ​
 Cheers guys

 Additionally, what is the purpose of linking the wireshark container to other nodes? Will it have visibility to the connected interface? Is there an advantage to connecting the container to a node?Should it act as a MITM and capture kevery packet? 
 I’m just very confused and the documentation didn’t specify and Eve ng seems insistent on preferring videos over text documentation.

I am working on turning it into a truenas box but keep running into an issue. I want to add a dual 10g nic and 8 port sata card in the spare ports on the riser card. My issue is that they are not being recognized. The lights come on but they are not seen in bios or truenas. There was already a sata card installed in one of the ports that work but adding anything new does not seem to work. That card was already there. I am new to riser cards and unsure what to do next. Below are some troubleshooting steps I have taken.
  
Swap in the new sata card into the working port..... guess what... it works.... so I know that slot accepts anything. The other slots do not work on that riser card.
 
Reset bios... nothing changed. The other riser card is not accepting anything. Still just that 1 slot on that 1 riser card.
 
Enabled and disabled almost everything in bios. It never sees the new card on any of the other slots on that riser card or the other riser card. Just that one slot on that one riser card.
 
 Thank you for any help... I want this to replace my current usb hard drives asap...
 Edit 1: in the bios it talks about 2a and 2c being enabled. I turned them to disabled and the intel raid card stopped working.

 The first part is a com port. It needs vcp enabled. The second part is a usb device. The driver for this device is not on the internet and is installed from a directory.
 The problem occurs when windows update updates the system. The com port disappears and the gate program fails to connect. The only way to fix it when it gets like this is to uninstall and reinstall the driver.
 I've tried disabling driver updates but that doesn't seem to fix the problem. I'm not sure why but windows update seems to be poking around with devices in a way that breaks the system.

 I've been at a MSP for about 4 years now and I over see most of network infrastructure for clients. I came from a large enterprise that was a Cisco shop, since I was pretty new when I worked at this larger corporation I never got into the weeds of ISE. Now being in the industry for some years know I wanted to see if anyone had thoughts on learning Cisco's ISE platform. 
 I have a cluster of R620's in my lab and I decided to spin up a ISE VM and connect it to my GNS3 lab, so all the setup of ISE makes sense to me connecting to a AAA server, utilizing 802.1x. I just wanted to get some opinions on if its really worth it to learn this platform, currently none of my MSP's clients use this however long term I'm looking to do network administration for a hospital. It seems (from my view) that its more beneficial to learn ISE if you utilize it but its not worth learning like other core concepts like CCNA, AWS etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Like the title says I have a set of workstations at work with an unusual setup. These workstations are a 911 dispatch center and each station consists of 3 separate PCs, 5 monitors (2 PCs with 2 each nad the 3rd with just 1 monitor), all connected together with a type of KVM switch that allows users to control each machine with just one keyboard and mouse and have the desktops act as if they are all on one machine.
 The KVM device is called an Adder CCS controller and the way it functions is each machine is connected to this controller via USB and the kb/mouse connect to it. The controller allows you to move the mouse from one screen to another but in doing so switches the input of both kb & mouse to the corresponding PC. The reason why we have this odd setup instead of just consolidating the functions to one PC is that we do not own two of the PCs as they are provided by external entities to be used with their specific software product.
 This all works perfectly fine on 3 of the 4 stations but the 4th has had literally everything replaced and it continued to cause the mouse to randomly jump around, the browser windows to refresh or close and lose any info that had bene typed in, and other odd ball issues. Currently we have it setup where the one PC that had the odd issues completely separated from the controller and other systems but this is not ideal as it requires the use of two sets of kb/mouse.
 Has anyone used a setup like this before and if so do you have a recommendation for a replacement product? A traditional KVM or USB splitter is not an option as they cannot rely on needing to use a button to switch inputs, nor is a USB hub as they need the kb/mouse to only function on one screen at a time.
 So far the only thing I have been able to find is software products but we would prefer not to use that and stick with a hardware physical connection.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work at a small company that provide CCTV systems to customers. We are currently in the process of upgrading our systems and I have been tasked with finding a way to setup our IP cameras on a VLAN using a "router behind a router". The equipment I have to work with is an IP camera (HikVision), a Ruijie router, connected to the office router and a Ruijie switch. The setup we currently have goes:
 Office router -> Ruijie router -> Ruijie POE switch -> IP camera
 What we are trying to do is set the camera up so that the office router could be on a network for example 192.168.1.1
 and the camera could be setup on 192.168.2.1 but still connect to the internet as it requires internet to be viewed remotely. I have managed to set this up fairly easily however, we also want to possibly avoid any rogue connections being able to access the office network if they managed to break onto the "cameras network". I am not entirely sure if this is possible as obviously the camera needs to access the internet. Right now, when connected to the Vlan that the camera is on (192.168.55.1), I am still able to access everything on the office network (192.168.1.1). Is there a way to avoid this?
 We also are trying to see if there is a way to access the camera wirelessly through being connected to the office network, however, again, I feel this may not be possible as right now, I need to be connected directly to the Ruijie router through ethernet to access the camera.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated.

 This is pretty simple to find in the closet, but horrible to find in the field.
 I've considered room names in a drop, but that can change. As time goes on, and more runs go in for more devices, we'll find a drop A-12 raise C-48.
 I was hoping to learn if anyone here has a program that we can load up drawings and update this information of where drops are. Pin point high or walls etc..
 It sure would beat a spreadsheet that needs to be update and is then forgotten about in a year's time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I've switches HP/H3C A5800 and lot of of OEM SFP modules. If module is coded as "common / general", works in my switches. So, the line lights up, the data flows through., but in console is message:
  
This is not a supported transceiver for this platform. HPE does not guarantee the normal operation or maintenance of unsupported transceivers. Please review the platform datasheet on the HPE web site or contact your HPE sales rep for a list of supported transceivers.
  
And not work DDM and is not possible to read manufacturer information (S/N and date code).
 I've some generic code, with which module works better. Works DDM, but in manufacturer info is a "generic" serial number and date code. I have found the following about the code:
 Block A0h:
  
in bytes 60h - 62h is string "H3C"
 bytes 63h - 74h are set to 00h
 in bytes 75h - 7Fh are some hexacodes, I don't know their meaning.
  
In block A2h in page 02h is H3C (HP?) specific code:
  
bytes 80h - 93h is serial number (ASCII)
 bytes 94h, 95h are set to 00h
 bytes 96h - 9Dh is date code (ASCII)
 bytes 9Eh - FFh are a mystery to me
  
Small problem is that serial number and date code are at two positions. At standard positions in A0h block and at H3C (HP) specific positions in A2h block, page 02. If I insert module to "generic" switch, informations from A0h block are read. If I insert module to H3C/HP switch, i get informations from A2h block. If I change serial number and/or date code in A2h block, H3C/HP switch don't identify module as HP compatible any moreSomewhere is some checksum / hash.
 My question is - know anyone exact structure of data in A0h block at addresses 60h - 7Fh and in block A2h (page 02h) at addresses 80h - FFh? Is there a SFP module code with another structure that will work in switch HP/H3C A5800?
 Thanks,
 Zbynek

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[https://i.ibb.co/nwcNPx1/opengearlte.png
 I inherited an OpenGear device that has an active LTE card in it. It is currently at a remote site with no technical hands. The site topology is shown in the above screenshot. I have not previously configured or deployed these devices.
 The OpenGear device is attached to a random port on the site's core switch (a Cisco 2960X). The switch has no dynamic or static routes configured, just a default gateway upstream to the FortiGate.
 This site regularly has outages with its current ISP. I was wondering if it is possible in these failure scenarios to route internet traffic out the OpenGear device's LTE connection automatically?
 The other potential rub - according to the OpenGear device, the SIM card is using a "private" public IP, meaning a VPN tunnel is required to access it.
 Thanks, in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Bit of a newbie question here. Sorry if this is a too simple question for this forum.
 I get data packets
  
Have a header and payload and trailer 
 Header has routing information (source/destination IP address, type, number)
 Payload is the actual Data
 Trailiure is vary between protocols but is generally used for (Cyclic) Redundancy Checks (CRC)
 
 The data packets are all given a number before they are sent.
 The computer uses these numbers to put the information back together in the right order (they can travel different routes over the internet and arise out of sequence.)
  
I also get protocols are a set of rules and various places talk about them being a set of rules governing how information travels across the internet but is it not really the packets that do this? Are protocols maybe more about defining the data packets and how they are used/unpacked?
 I am trying to understand this at a high level to teach computing at a secondary school. I worked in IT for many years and have never had to understand the details of this.

 When looking for our next firewall I'd like to have a feature where I can assign specific VLANs to different groups of VPN users. For instance, when internal sales team members remotely connect they are assigned an IP address from VLAN 666 and when accounting team members remotely connect they are assigned an IP address from VLAN 123. 
 If I were looking for devices that can do this, what is the name of the feature would I be looking for? Is it something that firewalls do or is this more along the lines of a needing a dedicated device, like a VPN concentrator?
 Finally, as this is still in the planning phase, are there any VPN-as-a-service offerings that can do this?

When talking to the users, we're finding that they're not clicking on anything in the emails, but still failing the click through test. If it was just a handful, we'd say "users be users", but they swear up and down they're not, and when we look in KnowBe4, the logged IP isn't from our range and shows as owned by MS. We're starting to wonder if the MS anti-spam is testing out the links differently than before which is causing the failures. Anyone else seeing similar or have any thoughts?

We currently have the PC's directly patched into a cisco router which is running a EZVPN connection from a Cisco ASA we have specifically for this. We like this setup because the PC is always connected to the states network not needing to use a remote client software like any connect. 
 The problem is these routers are going EOL soon and we would like a more cost efficient solution vs buying more routers that serve just this one purpose. Any ideas how we can go about a different solution? Should we move back to a AnyConnect profile and just tell the users they have to log into every time?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just had my umpteenth meeting about the above topic. There's a view among the exec team that having someone manually go through the shared drives for each department would be too time-consuming and that there's a technological approach that would eliminate most of the grunt work by automatically categorising the various files (i.e. by identifying PII content, for example).
 I know there are tools that can do this - we've looked at them in the past - but my take is that the grunt work still needs to be done. All you've really done is come up with a way to prioritise what you look at first.
 - someone needs to check the files that are identified as PII to confirm that they contain PII.
 - someone needs to check the files that haven't been identified as PII to confirm that they don't contain PII.
 In both cases someone needs to decide whether or not the files need to be kept, or if they need to be deleted in line with data retention policies.
 Am I thinking about this the wrong way? Is there an approach that I'm not considering?

 ...jist of config looks like this;
 ip prefix-list yy_TO_xx
 seq 5 permit 10.59.10.0/24
 seq 10 permit 10.69.10.0/24
 etc

 ** the first prefix gets the community but the second one doesn't. Each prefix already has an existing standard community & excommunity, per my bgp table

 For example, i setup isolated environment (container) for developer to work on his web project, create user "someuser123" with ssh/sftp access. But for proper work of web-server files must belongs to www-data user, not even group. If i change owners to www-data - problem with uploading files. Some devs didn't know how to change file owners, so its constantly small problems and delays.
 How can dev upload files from "someuser123" via ftp\sftp without manually change then for www-data user ?
 Make user root ?
 Run web-server\php-manager\ets from "someuser123" ?
 Or there is proper solution for this situation ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, sorry if this is a stupid question. I've been thrown into this by my ankles and I'm having to learn a lot really fast so I'm making mistakes left and right.
 I'm trying to get an SNMP walk of a Juniper firewall. I know that in order for your SNMP walks to "resolve" the OIDs (ie, say "SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0" instead of "iso.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0"), you need to give SNMPWALK.exe a set of MIBs. So, fine, I got a bunch and then supplemented that with the Juniper MIBs I could find from LibreNMS's GitHub.
 After doing that the 1.3.6.1.2.1 OIDs resolve, but the enterprise OIDs (1.3.6.1.4.1) still don't -- I see this:
 SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.11.8.5.1.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00
 SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.11.9.1.0.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00
 SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.11.9.1.1.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00
 SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.2636.3.1.15.1.12.2.1.0.0 = Timeticks: (0) 0:00:00.00
 The SNMPWALK command I'm using is:
 snmpwalk -M "C:\MIBs" -v2c -c myjunipercommunitystring the.firewall.ip.address "1"
 Any insight on this would be hugely appreciated. I understand this might be an odd question; please don't ask why I'm trying to do this when there are better tools available.
 This is, unfortunately, how I need to do it.

 The situation: I have 5 work stations that are shared by many employees. They do not need own users, just an "employee" user to access office and the NAS, because they are in general not doing typical office work. So no individual mails, onedrive, teams, etc necessary. 
 If you could create this from scratch how would you do it?
 I thought about getting 5 win11 pro licenses and 5 device licences for office 2021 and then create the same local users (Admin and employee) on every device. Could I also create those users in Azure ad and manage them there, so I do not have to create the users on each device individually? How can I setup the printers for everybody without doing this manually on every pc? What is needed and are there any monthly costs to expect?
 Looking forward to hear from your experiences and recommendations!

 After this error log, I fixed the street field and the user synced with Azure AD.

 I tried by clicking “Restart provisioning” and waiting for a full cycle
 I also tried by clicking “Stop provisioning” and then click “start provisioning” and waiting for a full cycle
 I also tried by clicking “Stop provisioning” and then click “Restart provisioning” and waiting for a full cycle
 I tried “provision on demand” by adding the specific user but it keep failing.
 I also tried to remove the group which the user was in from provisioning.

 Anyone got this issue ? If yes, did you manage to provision your user ?

 I'm currently working with MDT to create a new Windows 10 deployment for a client of us. They use multiple Lenovo laptop types, T14, X250, x1, P15, etc and are using an offline media tool (USB). For some reason im unable to deploy the associated drivers per laptop type via de Task sequence. I've given up to try and deploy them during the task sequence via the official way.
 ​
 I've now created a script to manually run after the deployment from the USB where it will install all the drivers. I've created multiple "driver" folders per laptop type, the script is located in each laptop type folder so it will only install the right drivers.
 ​
 Im now looking into a script to check the %make%\%model% and run the associated laptop type script. Say i'm deploying the task sequence on a Lenovo T14, and the script in that specific laptop type folder is called DriversT14.bat. Could anyone help me with the creation of this script?
 ​
 Folder structure: USB>Drivers>T14>(driver folders + script.bat)

 We are using our ISP with a modem that is set to IPv4. After that we have our main router (Archer AX73 v1.0, running 1.2.2 Build 20220317 rel.50456(4555)), which I am able to configure as I want. This is a must, because we are using port forwarding for some of our services (might change it later, with different server located elsewhere).

 So, how do you upgrade MSXML? Do you simply uninstall the old version and install the new one?
 From reading List of Microsoft XML parser (MSXML) versions and Installing and Redistributing MSXML) it seems like the newer version won't be backwards compatible, and software using it won't work.
 Is there any way to determine whether any installed software depends on this component?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is a fun situation, we lease a facility with multiple companies and a shared utility area that contains the network ingress. When we moved in we installed a small wall mount enclosure with a lock for our equipment in that room. It is well marked that it is our property.
 About two year ago we found somebody popped the lock and installed their own equipment in our cabinet. We rose hell with the landlord and got it removed.
 Fast forward a couple month the same thing happened and we suspected it was the carrier tech but couldn't prove it. Since we are closest to the room our business lead on-site is often asked to allow service people in the room and we inform him under no condition should any carriers ever be given non-escorted access.
 A few weeks later we get a call that a carrier tech showed up unannounced on a Friday afternoon. He was informed we would be happy to schedule to have him return on Monday to be a good neighbor but if they couldn't escort him we didn't have time. They tech was pissed.
 When he returned the next week he still wasn't happy. Now we are in a small market so there are not a lot of local techs so we will run into him over and over....he doesn't provide service with a smile.
 Fast forward to a couple weeks ago and we have power outage and telecom issues. We arrive at the facility and find someone popped our lock again and unplugged the fiber from just our equipment (none of our neighbors).
 Before this incident the landlord refused to allow us to put our own surveillance on this common space. After explaining to him we would hold his company liable for any business losses due to their negligence to secure our equipment in a shared space we finally have a camera installed. I'm low key hoping the person who has been doing this is the person we think--we will have video evidence this time to take action.
 I hate having shared equipment closets of any type.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I've got a weird issue with random POE failure on one of my Meraki 120-48FP switches. 
 The switch specs state that it can provide 740 W of usage, and I've got several POE Polycom phones connected to it. Each phone draws about 3W, though each advertises to the switch that it needs up to 7W.
 However, powering more than 5 phones simultaneously results in a complete POE failure. The instant a sixth device is plugged in, all POE goes completely offline. None of the phones advertise that they're pulling more than 3.7W at the time of failure. Looking at the power status page for the Meraki switch shows that it's using 13.9 W of 1612 W (???) available prior to its failure.
 I've contacted Meraki support, and they thought it was "weird" that the switch shows 1612 W available, but they haven't provided any tips or thoughts on why that is. Thinking the switch was defective, I replaced it with another Meraki 120-48FP, but the exact same problem occurs. I've experimented with different ports (including powering up the devices in different order), but the same problem occurs. 
 The TL;DR version: Any five POE phones can be active, but the instant I power up a sixth POE phone, all POE goes offline.
 Has anyone seen this or something similar to it? I'm at my wit's end here and would greatly appreciate any troubleshooting tips.

 https://old.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/108hl0q/cisco_secure_endpoint_customers_have_you_seen
 https://community.cisco.com/t5/endpoint-security/cse-8-0-1-and-8-1-3-causing-significant-slowdown-after-4-5-days/td-p/4731584
 After months of talking to TAC, they finally reproduced this and confirmed it's a bug. Long story short, it's a GDI object leak with Cisco Secure Client which is included with Secure Endpoint version 8.x.
 Both TAC and a Cisco employee in the above community thread said that the bug is fixed in 8.1.7, which will be released mid-April. I currently have a pre-release, unsupported 8.1.7 client added to my Secure Endpoint console for testing, and I can confirm that it is fixing the problem as intended.
 Wanted to provide an update for anyone that has been experiencing this.

 Anyway the problem is that over the last couple of days I've noticed internet performance on WiFi devices has gone to absolute crap. I have a 1200 Mbps internet connection and from wired devices I can get a speed test showing almost 1 gig down. Wifi devices connected to my Cisco APs is something like 180 Mbps on 5 Ghz and on 2.4 Ghz the speeds are like 60 Mbps down. I can tell something has gone on with the Cisco stuff because if I take the xfinity gateway out of bridge mode and use that WiFi I get download speeds similar to the wired download speeds. 
 Hoping some folks can give me some things to look at and hopefully get my wireless back to normal.

Anyway, I'm flying by the seat of my pants here, it's a wild but informative ride and I just realised I screwed up big time while switching email providers.
 I switched the email provider from Exchange to Google, migrated all the mailboxes and everything seemed fine for a few weeks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Reflecting on my career one truth has always emerged: "The harder I worked, the more they took me for granted."
 It seems counter-intuitive, frustrating and demoralizing, so why is it?
 Well, simply put: They get used to it. When you consistently deliver high-quality work or go above and beyond what's expected, it can become the new norm. People may come to expect this level of effort from you without recognizing or acknowledging it.
 Another reason is that people may not realize how much effort you're putting in. If you're not vocal about your accomplishments or don't receive regular feedback or recognition, others may not be aware of the extent of your hard work.
 And lastly, you're running around all stressed out and scaring the commoners. Relax, everyone likes Tony, the IT guy who moves like a sloth, and doesn't react to anything, we love Tony! But then there's Marc, running around, always walking fast in the hallways, slow down Marc! His clothes are a little too tight, go up a size Marc, it's okay, relax.
 So what can you do about it? The answer is obvious, don't give so much, pull back a little. Now mind you, and put down the pitchforks, I'm speaking to my IT heroes out there, the ones who go above and beyond, answer the phone during Thanksgiving dinner, or Saturday morning at 2am.
 IT admins work in the background, they get no recognition or praise, we work in the shadows, in the server rooms and IDFs where no one can see.
 When things are working, great! "So, what exactly do you do here again?" And when things aren't working: "Hey, are you working on this or what is it you do here exactly?"
 So relax, and don't be a hero, they don't give a damn either way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello /r/sysadmin!
 Just an FYI, I am about 6 months in to my first Sysadmin position and I have been enjoying it so far. That said, I am running into issues with a boss ask: Separate Domain Admin level ability (eg: GPO changes, ADUC, etc) from our existing Admin accounts. 
 Quick background of our environment:
  
Large enterprise with thousands of accounts and servers globally.
 Currently, privileges are tiered out like: 
 Admin Level Accounts, Admin rights on "high security" systems (eg:domain controllers, SCCM, core infrastructure, Active Directory / group policy management)
 Server Level Accounts. Admin rights on Utility or Application host boxes. 
 Branch Level Accounts. Unprivileged workstation accounts. 
 Tiered accounts only have logon rights to their respective Tiered Servers.
 
 Domain Level Servers require MFA for Local/RDP access. Our MFA solution uses federation out to Azure to authenticate. 
  
Now the ask: What would the best way to split DA functions to its own dedicated account, but will not have admin rights over anything but AD itself. 
 My idea was to Remove DA from the existing Admin Level accounts and create a dedicated "DA-Only" account that would not have login rights to any server (or only to a utility box), use the existing admin accounts to log into a jumpbox, and utilizing runas to open any tools needed to perform AD administration. That said, I am running into the problem where I cannot restrict the "DA-Only" accounts from local and TS login as that prevents that account from any sort of interactive login. 
 I would love to know if anyone else has done something like this or could point me in the right direction on how to implement. Thank you folks!

I understand that tracert is a layer 3 protocol and to trace a path at layer 2 would require access to each switch's mac address table, but it's 2023 god damnit there should be some standardization to deal with this by now. I know there's a cisco solution that relies on CDP but, again it's 2023 not everyone uses Cisco anymore.
 you'd think somebody would make some combination of regular traceroute that sends arp requests along the way at each hop to triangulate this information

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company is in the market for a copper cable qualifier. We need a way to quickly, easily, and reliably test our primarily Cat6 infrastructure for bandwidth, packet loss, and continuity. Additionally, we don't have anyone on staff that is an expert at networking, so having a tester that is easy to learn and use is almost a necessity, as we don't have the time or resources to learn complex networking concepts. For the most part, everything is Cat6, but the cable certifier needs to support potential future infrastructure upgrades such as Cat7/Cat8. Based on the research I've done, there are a few options, but I'm not sure which direction to go. I really like the look of the Fluke DSX2-8000, but I thought Fluke sold off their network testing line to NetAlly, so am I buying into a dead ecosystem? NetAlly doesn't seem to have an exact replacement for the DSX2-8000, but the EtherScope nXG looks promising. There's also the WireXpert 4500-PRO and NetXpert XG2 from Softing, but I'm worried those will be too complicated to learn and use effectively. Any advice is appreciated.

 Just wondering what kind of questions/exercises should I expect when being interviewed for a network automation role ? Will be there be a whiteboard coding session ?
 I've been interviewed for plenty of network engineer roles so I know what kind of questions will be asked.
 I have a repo with tons of projects I've worked, I'm familiar with the common libraries/tools used in network automation (ansible, nornir, netmiko, scrapli...SOT like netbox/nautobot) I know python and dabbled with frontend stuff like react and js. Also integrated backend technologies with some of my projects including SQL database, created my own APIs using fastapi or flask, made a full CI/CD pipeline using a dev/prod environment with pre/post check validations.
 I'm not a expert on the tools above, looking to cover as much ground as possible then become an expert on whatever tool the org uses once I'm in.
 I'm currently going through a course about python data structures and algorithms, this may be overkill for a role like this but honestly I don't know what to expect. Any tips/help so I can prepare would be appreciated!
 Thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier this year, MS put out a notice that they plan to deprecate boot.wim support in WDS. In a configuration-as-code model (which will soon be mandated if you are working in the US financial sector), many organizations are necessarily moving to Intune or other "DevOps" tools to do post-OS configuration and state management. What these tools lack is bare metal provisioning and native WDS fills this gap perfectly.
 And while I've always been a huge fan of SCCM/MECM, it's doesn't make sense to support that scale of infrastructure just for OSD. Likewise MDT also has a great many extraneous features and is, frankly, not suitable for the enterprise.
 I am aware that you can create a custom PE image that will boot to WDS but recent PE Setup OCs seem to lack some of the command line parameters that were present in earlier versions, and I feat that w/o official boot.wim support, custom PE support cannot be relied upon in a mission critical environment.
 And while third party and even some open source solutions exist (in fact I wrote my own a few years ago), using an MS provisioning tool to deploy MS operating systems is optimal in terms of streamlined support and vendor management.
 I created user feedback item here, Please upvote if you'd like see continued support for WDS.

Essentially it can only handle a single user login and single password and that account has full permissions to change password etc. 
 We have some contractors that we need to grant access to this app, but we would like to hide password from them. 
 We tried some apps like lastpass, but found you could just save the password to your browser and instantly see what it is. 
 Anyone had to handle something like this?

Noticed several clients go offline and eventually come back up so I prepare for early morning phone calls or texts of workstations down, remotes not working, blah blah. Get offices back up except for one. This one is out in the sticks and the furthest from my office. Since I didn't get a phone call from them early I assume that Internet is down. As I'm checking the backup admin console and remote services the phone rings with an unknown number. Answer the phone and it's their office manager. First thing I say is "What the heck is going on over there?" I didn't even complete the sentence when their server pops back up online and the backup console says their online. With that I let Office Manger know that their phones should come back soon. Phone starts ringing. Other minor issues clear up as we're talking. Magic

 Allowed ports are 8001, 80,443,123,3389 and 53.
 Rest of the ports are blocked with the rule called "Block All Ports" 
 If Block All Ports rule is enabled then the connection to server is dropped after few minutes, if disable this rule then all is good for hours and days. 
 Inspected the packets with wireshark, the server is sending FIN request and the client is RST "resetting the connection"

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok. So, I currently have 144 small mini computers (actually, 2021 Apple TV 4Ks) with a bespoke app in single-app mode that are used on film sets for displaying graphics on computer screens, with remote loading of content and a control protocol for color correction, etc.
 Works great.
 The issue I have is with the # that can be simultaneously powered on at a time and associate with an AP. I have found that Qualcomm's Networking Pro 1200 platform within a (wait for it..) Ubiquiti Amplifi Alien on channel 165 works great for my use-case. Channel 165 is the only channel I have available for use on a film set. All others are unavailable, especially DFS channels. These are never available, because of Teradek Bolt camera wireless video systems.
 On the Alien, I can easily power on 100 or so Apple TVs and they associate fine. But, beyond this number, I need to space them out by several minutes. If I wait a few minutes, I can easily get 144 client associations and everything works fine and dandy. But, the inability to power them all on simultaneously could be a problem. On some sets, this would be impractical, because the power for the entire set is turned off at wrap, and turned on at call time the next day. So, ideally, I'd be able to have 150-200 associations happen seamlessly and without delay.
 So, question is: what other vendors are using this Qualcomm Networking Pro 1200 chipset with 8x8:8 MU-MIMO on 802.11ax in an AP that perhaps has a quicker client association time?
 Had my eyes on a Ruckus R850, perhaps with a Netgear M4250 AV Line switch (model # GSM4210PD-100NAS) which has a built-in DHCP server, as we've had very good results with this series of switches generally.
 Thoughts? Got any better ideas? Thanks!

 For me, it's vital, that I can keep up with every little task that might come my way and since the few internal admins before me never bothered all too much with their work here, I don't have any tools, to manage my work with. Luckily, my employer is quite generous and told me, to make a list with necessary tools and equipment, which they are willing to purchase for me.
 I haven't gotten access to the entire infrastructure yet. In fact, I'm still pretty much just a user, with no admin access, whatsoever, but I suspect, that will be given to me in time.
 But until then, I need said tools, to manage my tasks and work and not lose sight of anything. I don't know, if I need a fully blown ticketing system yet, since there won't be too many inquires in the beginning, but something, to create projects with and manage all steps of the way, keeping track of steps in between and also logging all activities, I've written down, without having to manually save them, would be fantastic.
 Keep in mind, my former employer already had all the tools, but they were enterprise solutions for keeping tracks of dozens of customers. 
 If you have any recommendations and have been in a similar situation, I would appreciate any and all tips for my future work here.
 Thanks a lot and have a nice week!

 I'm curious about it because users currently connect with GlobalProtect. Nearly all traffic is tunneled for URL filtering and inspection purposes. Two issues with that are how to dynamically handle the exceptions for what is not tunneled and public WIFI connections that redirect to a captive portal to accept terms before allowing a user out to the internet. For whatever reason, EDL's can't be used to define tunneling exceptions.
 My consideration of the Windows client is mostly driven by the ability to manage it with group policy and possibility to be a more seamless experience for users.

 I'm currently considering re-evaluating the endpoint security stack, and I wanted to get some thoughts and opinions on the best options for remote only devices. It's been a while since I've tested most of the products and I know some of the products would have likely changed a fair amount. As I suspect most products would have adjusted by now to device only and zero trust.
 The environment does have a large amount of application change and custom plugin development thus solutions like Windows Applocker and ThreatLocker would have way too much administrative overhead. Locking down the binaries could work if it was an automated system existed based on a Security Sandbox (Crowdstrike, VMRay, etc) but this would still be limited capability (file-less, etc).

 So I'm currently in the process of creating a security group that contains all users for our backup provider. The idea is to include all users in AD, then remove the smaller list of users and those will be the ones who are backed up. 
 So what would be the best way to do this? Manually adding the users isn't an option as it would take an extensive amount of time.

 I'm moving the company to a new plant and I have the opportunity to reorganize the network. I have about 100 users, in the network I have file server, applications and remote workers . I have a couple of L3 switch DELL 5048F connected with VLT as core switch. The perimeter firewall is hardware and it is connected to the core switch with 2x1GB cable. To the core switches are also connected the ESX host that contains all the production VM. In order to increase the network security I want restrict the traffic to some VLANs where the virtual machinaes are connected. The question is: is it better filter the traffic with the perimetere firewall, with the ACL on the switch or the better solution is to introduce an additional internal firewall as virtual machine?
 This is a schematic L2 connection
 https://freeimage.host/i/HOxj9K7
 In my opinion the virtual firewall appliance should be the better solution (statefull inspection, maneageability, ecc.). I will be "tromboning" but I think it will be acceptable.
 ​
 Thank you.

 ​
 I'm running a backup server with a Quantum Superloader 3 directly connected by SAS. The server has both Backup exec and Veeam backup and replication. Veeam has taken over as our main backup for onsite and scaling out,however i'd like to use it for tape backups as an additional air-gapped last resort backup.
 ​
 Backup exec works fine with the tape loader however Veeam doesn't seem to acknowledge the tapes. I've reinstalled the drivers from Quantum and added the server in Veeam as a tape library. Any advise on what to try next? Does having backup exec on the server cause issues with other applications accessing the tape drive even once closed and services have been stopped? The fact it works fine on in Backup Exec suggests drivers and hardware are all fine. 
 ​
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I'm posting here in hope some people better educated and more knowledgeable than I am might be able to help with a bit of a technical headache I have!
 I play Rocket League professionally and I'm based in the UK. Rocket League is extremely sensitive to jitter for whatever reason and I'm having a real issue with it at the moment. Unfortunately, playing at a high level requires very low jitter.
 I currently use Zen Internet (FTTP) and have a high-end router and have noticed my routing to the Rocket League servers is pretty bad. Here's a link to a WinMTR showing the issue: Routing
 The first few hops always have pretty bad jitter along them and it's incredibly annoying, resulting in a lot of in-game issues. It gets worse at peak times. 
 I have contacted Zen about this issue but they won't — or can't — do anything. I use WTFast to circumvent further bad exchanges and that helps a lot, but there's still significant jitter and I feel this is because the first few hops are still used when routing. If I'm wrong about that, please let me know.
 Ultimately, I'm looking to change ISPs because of this. It's losing me money and time and is negatively affecting my mental health. To my understanding, I can't really know whether the routing of an ISP will be good or not without purchasing it first. What are my options here?
 I'd be very grateful if anyone from the UK can run a WinMTR to the same server and list their ISP alongside. To be clear, this issue is the same with pretty much all Rocket League servers.
 Thank you for your time and effort. I'll do my best to respond to comments!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I generally try to stay clear of replacing laptop batteries but I work for a none-profit and we try rinse all the life out of end user hardware that we can. Lately we've had a few HP & Dell laptops (Intune managed, AAD joined) come in with dead batteries not holding charge - after a replacement, they start getting issues relating to the CMOS checksum & TPM, which usually throws the laptops into Bitlocker recovery mode. Initially I thought the CMOS battery was also EOL but replacing that doesn't seem to help, neither does clearing the TPM either through BIOS or through Windows security settings. 
 It's gotten to the point where we've recalled the laptops that have had battery replacements and issued new ones due to the amount of tickets getting raised, but the laptops are still serviceable so I would like to come up with a solution to get them back into circulation. I used to work for an MSP and their hardware department would flat out refuse to fix or change any hardware on an Intuned laptop, including the battery. 
 Any advice please?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am configuring a bunch of cisco switches, and I have tried to automate my process.I have a simple python script that is sending all the config via xmodem to the device, then i set the management ip and save the config.This works fine, but, some of the switches, even after setting the managament ip in the managament, are automaticlaly changing that vlan to DHCP.
 Example:
 * (Boot a blank switch, say no to auto-configuration). > enable # copy xmodem: running-config # conf t # interface vlan 10 # ip address 192.168.10.2 255.255.255.0 # end # write mem 
 At this point, everything works fine. But, in some cases, when i connect a trunk cable from my network to that switch and do "show run int vlan 10" i see that it has changed to "ip address dhcp". This doesn't happen all the time, only some times.
 I have a small suspicion that it might be caused by PnP, but i have no idea how to avoid it or turn it off.
 Even after reloading the switch, some of them still keep the dhcp thing.Please help. its driving me nuts!
 Ps: (The reason i started sending config via xmodem is because when i was copy-pasting the configs, i had to do it un chunks, as it would ofter overflow the serial buffer. And sending line-by-line via the script takes forever.)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Reddit!
 I'm gonna get straight to the point on this one.
 I work for a large company with 2k+ employees, obviously we have quite a huge load on our HR and Salary department with all these employees. Currently whenever someone needs to hire someone, onboard someone, change an employeement agreement etc they do it via Microsoft forms that are connected to PowerAutomate to send the information to the correct place / inbox, this has been quite chaotic and we are looking into getting a proper "HR Service management" or ticketing system for HR and Salary instead.
 We have looked into the Freshservice HR workspace but since Freshservice is built for IT first it makes me quite sceptical, we also need to be able to easily create HR processes for recruitment orders, workpermits and employee changes and this has proven quite troublesome in the Freshservice demo I've worked with setting up. A lot of bugs and the documentation for Fresh leaves a lot to be desired.
 Therefore we are looking at other solutions but it's difficult to find out there, any tips or pointers?
 Our biggest needs are:
  
Users being able to submit tickets to HR, and HR being able to easily view and process said tickets.
 Users being able to order new recruitments, HR then needs to be able to view current ongoing recruitment processes in some sort of list or "view" listing all ongoing recruitments.
 Users being able to send in work permits with HR being able to track current workpermits, aswell as being alerted when a work permit is about to expire.
 Integration into Salesforce and Azure is a must.
 All of the above needs to be exported once a month as a .csv to our HR master so it can stay up to date with the changes.
 Bonus if it has support for integration / APIs with Teamtailor.
  
Thank you very much in advance Reddit, any tips are helpful and very much appreciated. Sorry for potentially poor grammar or spelling, English is not my first language.

 - I can go for a degree apprenticeship, level 5/6 in networking
 - I can not do any more apprenticeships and focus on individual qualifications i.e. CompTIA net, sec, etc...
 - I can try go for level 4 in security, but this is a half option as I'm not sure I would be able to complete this with my company

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For a museum, we need to run a web app in Kiosk mode for use with a touch screen. It is an single page app (Angular), and a keyboard is attached to the computer and accessible to visitors.
 What is important to us is:
  
It should always work, even if internet fails.
 It should be secure, i.e. people should not be able to access the system.
 Preferably it checks for updates online (e.g. webpage, docker container pull, snap update) 
 Alternatively, if we can remote desktop into it, we could manually update it
 
 Remote management/maintenance (SSH or remote desktop).
  
Good to know
  
We have made the app ourselves, so if needed, we can wrap it in electron.
 The app uses angular routing, so simple file:// hosting could be problematic.
 For hardware, we have an Intel NUC and a touchscreen display.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[good morning,
 i have an application (client-server) using tls for communicate, but i would like to make it "more secure" and prevent ssl-bump (in case one of the endpoint has some sort of https-proxy-mitm).(I know that in this option the other endpoint must accept "fake" root CA ssl-certifcate from mitm-proxy, i just want to also exclude this "risk").
 should i think about some sort of ipsec/wireguard alternative?
 thank you
 ps:
 already read about cert-pinning but it seems a bad idea. Same for HPKP.

 ​
 I want to use Huntress in a network that should not have direct connect to non-private IPs.
 According to Huntress, there is currently no support for "explicit-proxy-configurations". Currently, I am trying to find any other option.
 ​
 My first attempt was to assign one internal IP to every external DNS-connection, Huntress needs and to use HAProxy there as "non-decrypting" proxy:
 ​
 listen huntress-tcp bind 10.xx.xx.xx:443 mode tcp server-template huntress-aws- 1 huntress.io:443 check resolvers docker init-addr libc,none 
 --> And then to change in \etc\hosts:
 10.xx.xx.xx huntress.io 
 ...but I am still getting timeouts, when I try to connecto to https://huntress.io
 ​
 Do you have any idea on how to solve this without opening the network to the "full range of AWS-IPs", If I cannot work with DNS wildcards?
 ​
 Regards,
 ITStril

 I am in desperate look out for a cost-effective eBGP agg router that can cope with up to 4 uplinks with full bgp table.
 The thing is my traffic is very little, it will not even exceed 100mbps!
 All the routers that can cope with this routing table size are quite oversized for my network throughput.
 The most cost-effective option is Mikrotik, but from a pure image perspective, it may not work for us.
 From what I can see, the cheapest option would be Cisco ASR 1001-X with 16GB of RAM. Any other idea?

 This may be an issue for r/helpdesk or some such, but I think it qualifies for this sub as well. I have a user that has some issues with Excel files. Specifically, the files when opened via SMB using file explorer are opening verly slowly. So a 30 MB excel file will only download at like 10 Mb, so it takes forever. 
 The files when opened using the Recent Files tab in Excel work just fine. As expected. Also they work without issue over OneDrive or when saved locally. 
 Googling this issue reveals it is an issue with Excel file validation. So I turned it off. Still having the issue. Just curious if anyone here has any suggestions or ideas, or perhaps has encountered this issue themselves.

 What's the "Correct" or prefered way of managing all the customers diffrent 365 accounts?
 I've got some where I have an unlicenced admin account on their domain that I use but that gets messy logging in and out of everything constantly.
 I'm in the middle of setting a new one up and thought why not just add a new domain to my account and manage it all in one place. Seemed to work alright initially but there's no way of seperating the two organizations and one drive had my org details on it.
 After searching online I found out about tenants being part of multiple orgs but nothing about how to set that up from scratch. 
 Any help would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This seems to be the right place to ask, though I guess the question is a bit low-level...
 I've got a new FreePBX system replacing an old one, very similar, just a much newer version; the OS is based on Centos. Networking and Linux aren't my forte! The system has one card connected to our LAN and another connected to a dedicated Cisco DSL router which comes from our SIP trunks provider.
 I have got it setup so that it mostly works, but initial connections to the web server and to a soft phone are very slow. For instance 50 seconds to initiate a call. After that it's often quicker, which then makes diagnoses more difficult.
 I previously setup the old one up and think I had similar issues, but that was not too far off a decade ago!
 I have tried to copy the default gateway (and other routes) in each case
 Old one
 ​ default 11.11.11.11 0.0.0.0 UG 0 0 0 eth1 
 (I have replaced the correct IP address with 11.11.11.11)
 New one
 default gateway 0.0.0.0 UG 0 0 0 eth1 
 (The new one just has the word gateway, I entered it with the ip address.)
 Any suggestions of what I should be doing to work it out, or obvious reasons for this behaviour?

 I’m looking at the changes to authentication that are going to be enforced in November (link sauce below for reference). 
 I have two separate domains that I look after. The larger one is all up to date and sorted.
 The smaller one (acquisition) does have an AD integrated PKI infrastructure, but it is only used for internal websites. No user or computer enrolment.
 As such, I’m not seeing errors in the event logs relating to this KB as there is nothing to error upon.
 BUT
 Come November, will this company be able to authenticate?

 I want to be careful of the impulse of coming in strong with also not being the guy who thinks he knows better without learning anything first. I don’t plan on dropping a bomb onto the existing employees/department so the most important thing is how to start working with/integrating into the team, while learning the new environment- but also wanting to give a good impression to new to me upper management. 
 It’s a complicated environment so I’m thinking a list of infrastructure projects to help me get to know the team and have something to show my new boss. 
  
checking/learning/trial run of their disaster recovery and backups -tabletop exercises- what happens if server a goes down, switch b does, etc -meeting with each of my team separately to see what they have for projects, pain points, wishes -Review existing IT documentation -not sure if the political atmosphere leans this way yet, but if I have my way spending time in each IT role doing the job to get a feel for what they are doing/encountering
  
Find out how they are managing IT budget and schedule what is next to order or plan for on the annual schedule
 How are they doing contract management and are there any contracts coming due this year that I need to plan or budget for
 I have one project that is almost to completion that has stalled. I’m well versed and could whip it out pretty quick- How long do I wait before prodding it to completion? I could literally do this day 1 but it wouldn’t be appropriate. No one likes that guy. 
 Non-IT side- 
 Meet with all of the different departments to introduce myself, ask if they have any pain points, any currents projects, any future projects, any wishes, or anything else that I can do to help or make their lives easier
 So…what’s your first 90 days look like?

 Possible role: System Administrator - $65k *commute 50 minutes *M-F schedule from 7-3 *comes with Top Secret Security Clearance *more of what I want to do career wise 
 So I currently work as a contractor for a F500 company as a NOC Tech. The company makes all new hires contract to perm and the track record is, if you make it 6 months, you are converted to salary (I have been here for ~2 months). I currently make $80k as a contractor but have little to no benefits to speak of. When converted, the salary is $70k. As a caveat, I am not really enjoying the work and can see why the turnover rate is sky high. 
 I have been contacted by a company that I applied for shortly before starting this position for an interview as a system administrator. The company is in the aerospace and defense industry and the programs it supports are very intriguing to me. The role also comes with a top secret security clearance. I would also be getting hired on as a salaried employee with full benefits and a starting salary of $65k. 
 My career goal was to become a system administrator and an engineer following that. So I could also see myself moving up or out of the Sys. Admin role within the next 2 years as well (if all goes well of course). I guess my concern would be switching jobs so soon after starting the one I am at and the commute is double the time. Idk. 
 What would you chose? Any input is appreciated! 
 *all this could obviously be null and void if I am not selected anyway.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have a question regarding Cisco Business 150AX. I want to set up 802.1x authentication (using a RADIUS/NPS server) with dynamic VLAN assignment.
 I noticed that there is a limitation of 16 VLANs, but I couldn't find anywhere if this limitation is static or dynamic. In other words, is it possible to have more than 16 VLANs via 802.1x?
 Since I'm going to have to trunk between my switch and the terminal, does the limit apply at the trunk level or at the AP level itself? Or does it have to do with the number of simultaneously active VLANs?
 Thank you very much for your help. I have spent a lot of time looking for this information on the internet and in the documentation, but I have not found anything about this.
 Sincerely,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey r/networking friends and family! 
 Looking for some routing best practices help!
 I've got (2) Cisco Nexus 3132Q switches [running NXOS 7.0(3)I7(9)] that are configured for vPC and HSRP that host 10ish SVI's each.
 I only have a single ASA 5525 [running 9.1(2)] that has a single OUTSIDE interface going to our single carrier.
 These are the cards that I've been dealt, for now.
 I'm looking for the most resilient INSIDE Layer3 design with what I have. I have up to 2 physical interfaces on each Nexus 3k's that I can use for these Layer3 links. The ASA has plenty of physical interfaces to work with.
 I'm looking for the most resilient configuration possible, with the hardware that I have, to advertise the default route from the ASA and the SVI's from the core switches. I would prefer to stay away from static routes (other than the default route on the OUTSIDE interface) if I can. EIGRP or OSPF would be preferred.
 There seems to be heavy debate about using vPC's for layer 3 links. Some say its possible, depending on hardware/code version, some say that even if it IS possible, its poor design. Some people seem to recommend ECMP from the firewall.
 To the community: Would you please loan me your experience and provide some advice for my scenario, with some configuration examples?
 Thank you all SO very much for your contributions. 
 Mike

 Would it be possible to isolate a web server with pfsense in between that prevents it to access the lan? Like https://i.imgur.com/asmlj7Q.png. It would be like a cheap-o DMZ, sort of. The aim is to prevent the LAN to be attacked if the web server is compromised.
 I'm working in a small company where everyone is connected to the same wireless router and I don't want to change anything (put anything in between the router and the LAN clients). The web server is for test purposes so it won't be used for anything serious. But I still want to make sure that if it gets hacked it can't reach the LAN.
 Would this work? Is it safe? Thanks!

 Are there any other windows default settings that can be changed to improve performance?
 We have storage with SSDs in place and sufficient vCPUs and RAM for the RDS hosts (Server 2019), but the hosts seem relatively slow when opening Office applications. The machines are booting extremely fast since they are on the ssds, but the RDS environment seems a little bit slow.
 The performance with only one logged in user is the same as with 10 logged in users.
 ​
 Specs: 
 5-10 users per Host
 10 vCPUs
 64GB RAM
 FSLogix Profiles

 For my fellow Cyber Defenders and those interested in getting into this fantastic field, I wanted to share CVE_Prioritizer with the community; it is a python tool that helps you prioritize vulnerabilities based on CVSS, EPSS, and whether or not the vulnerabilities have been included in the CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I designed a network using primarily MikroTik and Ubiquiti for a mid sized hotel. Their request was that they do not want anything that needs expensive memberships. The cost of the equipment wasn't a problem. A logical amoubt for a membership will not be a problem. So i created the network with 4 ubiquiti switches, a MikroTik 48 port PoE switch and a CCR-1016-12G and 2 WANs for redunduncy. I would like to keep all of the existing setup. Please note that the firewall on the MikroTik is well configured, and there is port security on each switch. 
 My question is: would you adding any kind of firewall before the MikroTik router - something like a NGFW or some kindof IPS/IDS? I feel that the mikrotik firewall rules just don't cut it for today's standards and network moniroting and/or blocking is necessary. What kind of firewall could i add before the existing router that could filter trafic before it reaches the internal network?
 Basically it seems like i might need a transparent firewall.

So I am going a VPS route because I am a sysadmin/DevOps and can install/maintain myself and I don't want to fight limitations and obstacles of normal web hosting, managed databases, it even hard to find this combo. Also I don't know what those apps expect from system so VPS is a safe route because you can customize everything.
 So recommend good VPS hosting which also offers sql server (as a separate service or install into VPS from their media/license).
 I can install SQL server myself, that would be even prefered, but I don't want to bother my clients with separate swl server licensing for VM in VPS hosting so I would like that to be solved by VPS provider.

Then two weeks later another user has the same issue as well as me. I found KB5023696 was installed the same day, uninstalled it and RDP began working again. I removed the KB from all of the users whom had RDP issues and this resolved the issue. The two week hold was our RMM software holding back updates as we have it setup. I am not sure why that KB is breaking RDP for users but I hope this helps another sysadmin from trying to determine why RDP broke. The weirdest part is it is hit or miss as some users with the update do not have issues while others can't work at all.

Yet, I think for many of us, we are in this space of being willing to learn, but its hard to understand just what direction. Then when we do choose one, its got 50 branches. 
 ​
 Future seems to be cloud, and IMO not IaaS but PaaS and SaaS.
 Been cruising along and learning Power Platform. This is on top of O365 Teams, SharePoint and all the admin portals to do normal traditional Sysadmin stuff, along with PowerShell scripting and command to admin those portals via CLI.
 Then just the other day I am trying to automate something, and it seems to do it I need to use Microsoft graph. I never even heard of this before two days ago. I was able to setup things in O365 to connect in and "get" the data I wanted. Then I realized that I have no idea how to output it in some readable format for an end user. Looks like Python dictionaries. Pretty sure its web code, I am not a web dev. I know I can figure it out but:
 Where do I draw the line? Where do I focus? I have fun going down each rabbit hole I open, but where do I ensure that I am ultimately valuable as an employee, which in turn means I cand ensure I am compensated? Money isn't everything, but at the end of the day I want to make it, and I am a company man, a 9-5er, a person that likes to clock in and clock out. Whatever you call it.

I asked them why they couldn't wait to install it, and they said they had scheduled this two weeks ago. We lost some business over it. About 2 hours where the network was completely down. The camera technician managed to bring it back up somehow. I thought it was their fault, and wrote my boss a Cover Your Ass (CYA) ("mine"). He immediately shot back with "Why didn't you give them a port?!" I'm feeling really stupid over this, and feel like I might be losing my job when I go in Monday. Has anyone ever done this before, and forgotten to tell a vendor which port to use? 
 TLDR: I forgot to give our camera company a port to use their static IP on. Now I'm in some hot water.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi.
 We are considering moving to MS 365 from Google Workspace for a multitude of reasons. Most steps are straightforward, as far as Google Drive, Gmail to Exchange Online (and I've done exchange migrations in the past), etc
 As we are running through our prep checklist with sales department, we realized there is going to be a major snag, that we haven't considered.
 Our Sales team is using their "Google Account" instead of email/password to authenticate against a multitude of services, for example - HubSpot, various marketing sites, and a multitude of other tools that they use.
 Their Google accounts are ["joan.smith@COMPANY.com](mailto:"joan.smith@COMPANY.com)" not "@gmail.com), since "company.com", is now going to be hosted by MS, their "social logins" are now going to be Microsoft's ones, not Google's.
 While I can assist them with migrating a couple of these services to email/password authentication, instead of "Social Login", I'm sure we are not the first people to run into this problem.
 So is there a suggested way to do it? Or are we in the dreaded territory of "VENDOR LOCK IN" ?
 🙀
 P.S.:
 35 people start up. But not a tech one. So we have 1 IT - person - me. Migrating 700 = 35 people x 20-30? Social login accounts on various websites - is not something I want to tackle.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello community,
 I'm currently stuck with a network problem. Maybe one of you can help me.
 For a shake test of an RJ45 to fiber optic converter, it must be checked for correct functionality during the simulated earthquake.
 What do I have in mind: My idea would be the following structure... Laptop -> (RJ45 cable) -> Converter -> (FO loop TX to RX)
 https://ibb.co/vLvQz5R
 Now I think I know that the UDP protocol is one-way and I can use a python script with the socket library to send a UDP packet over the laptop's ethernet interface to itself over the loop with the converter. If the packet arrives at the open socket, the connection is OK.
 Unfortunately this doesn't work. I receive the sent packet at any time. The packet is probably still delivered internally in the computer and does not leave it via the Ethernet interface. I tried to set up a route locally for the IP used (Route add 192.168.1.0 MASK 255.255.255.0 IF 9). Unfortunately, this also does not bring the desired result.
 I would be very grateful for any food for thought.
 regards

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have 50+ HP desktops of the same model new in the box that need to be deployed in the coming weeks. Long story short - we recently had a cyber attack that resulted in us rebuilding our network/servers and we lost a couple of staff along the way who were the ones who usually handled our imaging process. On top of that our software packages have broken links and don't run correctly with the network rebuild, so we're not in good shape.
 The good thing is, most of our staff use the exact same base build on their devices, so if there is a way to clone one good image to multiple devices that are the same model, that would be ideal for this project. We have the software install packages, but manually pushing them can take 2-3 hours per computer and requires a few reboots. We have been lucky thus far to not need to replace a lot of PC's since the outage, and I was able to build several of them as spares to swap out if needed using the manual process.
 I know there are multiple tools out there that do many things, so I am mostly wondering what some recommendations are for something that will get the job done. We do have a couple KVM's so can image multiple at a time - but how do we package a clone of an image to push out, and what does that process look like - especially with joining devices to the domain.
 In my old job at an MSP, we just manually installed everything per device as we had a lot of small companies that requested maybe 2-3 computers at a time on average, so it was not a big deal. Prior to that I worked for a large hospital that had SCCM set up to deploy Windows on PXE boot, which was very nice, but I have no idea how that process was set up. Though I'd like to eventually find the time to create something like that for our environment.

The server room has a few old hyper-v cluster experienceing performance slowness issues.. Mangers decided we need to move all the VMs back to the main site. What's a best approach to this task? We want to get the move ASAP. The cluster still up and running, but feels like couldn't hang on for long time. I know USB drive is one option.
