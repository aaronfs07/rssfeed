I found a course on Udemy, but the accent of the instructor is making it tough for me to follow along. Are there any other options out there? Preferrably cheaper, or maybe on a site that doesn't require a subscription?

 I need to configure all of our endpoints to automatically connect to networks on the Public profile (not Private/Home) and am unsure of the best way to go about it. Is there an easy way to block through Intune or another method that I can deploy to the endpoints?
 One issue I find is that many devices have already connected to these networks and it would be nice to configure them differently instead of dealing with 100 blocks and network issue tickets the moment that would be enabled. One solution I thought of was to deploy a script that flipped all the networks to Public through the DWORD in the registry under all previously connected networks.
 This feels like a dumb question, so anything is helpful but let me know if I am being dumb and there is a better way to handle this (such as configuring the way private networks are handled)...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In short, have 10 new hires starting in a week's time. Our supplier has only just let me know there will be a three week delay in receiving the laptops for them. HR is putting on the pressure, as they said they'll have to pay them from their promised start date, even if they can't technically work yet. Has anyone experienced this problem and know some work arounds?
 Edit: for more context, I'm at a startup that's scaling quite quickly, so this has been an ongoing issue. Especially because we're based in the Netherlands and these new employees are mostly working remote. So I need to first get them delivered to the office, then set them up (MDM, etc), then dispatch to the employees wherever they are. We have a relationship with just one supplier, so always encouraged to go through them. However, seems like this won't be scalable. Good idea to have buffer stock so will use this thread for the next conversation. Also looking into more scalable solutions/platforms that streamline this whole thing. 
 Thank you for all the advice. Pray for me!

 ​
 Im trying to add a log-prefix to a message before its send to a syslog server. But something not working the way i thought it would.
 ​
 I read from a log file:
 source s_esxihostd {
 file("/data/logs/hostd.log" follow-freq(1) program_override("esxi070: ") flags(no-parse));
 };
 ​
 Destination to send:
 destination d_network {
 syslog("x.x.x.x" transport("tcp") port(514));
 };
 ​
 Logfile is being sent:
 log {
 source(s_esxihostd);destination(d_network);
 };
 ​
 The message is sent to the syslog server - but the "prefix" (esxi070) arent printed before the logmessage. I would have expected on the syslog server: "esxi070: <log string>"
 Am i doing it wrong? Or is there another way to add a prefix in syslog-ng, for what i can tell it should be the program-override() because the log-prefix() it deprecated?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This one has us perplexed. 
 Customer had a SBS 2011 server running QB DB manager for their enterprise QB. We upgraded to server 2019 standard, installed QB DB Manager as we would normally. Soon as we did almost every day they tell us they can't switch to Multi-user mode. We can't find anything wrong, no errors reported by DB Manager, service is always running. We simply login, tell it to scan, accept the warning and it starts working. Maybe for a day, maybe for a few hours, maybe for a week. 
 They can all get to the files just fine from the file share. When they choose multi user mode it doesn't work until we click the scan button again. We have several servers with DB manager installed but this one is the only one giving us a problem. Quickbooks support has no clue what's wrong. 
 The only oddity that occurred, while we were running the both the SBS 2011 and the 2019 standard some users had issues getting to file shares, as in the connection just seemed very slow. All local lan GB switched. As soon as we cut over the 2019 to be DC and GC with all roles, that issue disappeared. The only issue they still have is resetting the DB manager constantly to allow multi user mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a bit of a background: On September 14th, bleepingcomputer.com published an article of a security vulnerability in the desktop client of MS Teams. They recommended, that users should switch to the browser version of MS Teams, until a patch is available. I made all my users use the browser client after reading this article.
 Now I accidently found an article by Tony Redmond, in which he argues, that the vulnerability is not easily exploitable in the real world. He recommends not to switch to the browser version, and still use the desktop version of MS Teams.
 Microsoft itself doesn't think, that the vulnerability is critical, and has no priority of fixing the bug.
 So, did I overreact, when I advised my users to use the browser client? (They are nagging each week, that they would rather use the desktop client.)
 And how do you decide in general, if a security vulnerability is worth the effort?
 Edit: Made the argument clearer

 So in terms to understand this behavior, it is when a user connects an USB device with a specific ID, it will install the software/driver for the device.
 I have found the device ID of the device, and setup a detection for it, tested it with multiple different devices and it is the same for this device on every single PC that I have tested with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The win 11 laptops after upgrading to 22H2 still cannot connect to enterprise wifi based on PEAP. I have reviewed all posts regarding this issue and have tried disabling device guard, also tried with forcing TLS 1.2, but none of this helped. Which is suprising me, since I have seen a lot of comments claiming that helped. What I also have tried is updating the Intel driver for wifi card to the newest version. 
 What else I can try? Does it make sense to set 'Disabled" on Turn On Virtualization based Security, if it was set to Not Configured by defaults? This question is extra one, for curiosity only, since I tried to change to Disabled and still cannot connect. All windows 10 are able to connect at the same time.

 So, here's the situation - I updated my zabbix-server from 5.4.3 to 6.0.10, did it following the instructions on these pages:
 https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/installation/upgrade/sources
 https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/installation/install#installing-zabbix-daemons
 Then I start the server by doing
 systemctl start zabbix-server
 Everything seems to be OK at this point, and systemctl status zabbix-server returns this: Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/zabbix-server.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled) Active: active (running) since Mon 2022-11-07 17:03:57 MSK; 18h ago Process: 121913 ExecStop=/bin/kill -SIGTERM $MAINPID (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS) Process: 121915 ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/zabbix_server -c $CONFFILE (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS) Main PID: 121917 (zabbix_server) Tasks: 1 (limit: 48660) Memory: 1.8M CGroup: /system.slice/zabbix-server.service └─121917 /usr/local/sbin/zabbix_server -c /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf 
 However, when I open the address in the browser, I get a 503 error. Zabbix server log shows only this:

 I'd like to put some numbers to this to see if it's actually beneficial. I've done a quick bit of math and found that we would have to print out 130,000 pages to cost roughly the same as the iPad (about 4 years worth of this job). 
 Is there a way to factor in the environmental cost of the iPad? I'm guessing that all the silicon, glass, gold, zinc etc. are harder to recycle than standard paper, but it would be nice to have a way of quantifying this. 
 Is there any way I can work this out more scientifically than guesswork?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 Yesterday, I had a problem with firmware upgrade with C9300 and thanks to you, it is solved.
 Now, I have a another problem.
 I configured two 9200 switch as stack switch. After speaking with my colleague, we said that is better that we unstack the switches instead. The problem is that I now can not access the switches after configuring TACACS. I only configured tacacs (they are not installed in the network yet) but I did not configure line con 0 (which Im using for accessing the switches). It just ask me about a username for whatever reason and I can not grasp why.
 Anyway, I would like to factory-reset both the switches from rommon mode. The problem is that, I do not find the correct command to do it.
 Here is all the command in rommon mode for C9200:
 switch: ?
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 arp Dump or Clear ARP Table
 boot Load and boot an executable image
 cat Display text content from a file
 copy Copy a file
 dir List filesystems or a directory on a filesystem path
 help List command information
 history Show command history
 idprom Show idprom data
 ping Ping use ICMP protocol to get an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from host
 ping6 Ping use ICMP protocol to get an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from host
 reset Reset entire system
 set Set an environment variable value
 unset Unsets an environment variable
 version Show sboot version and runtime info
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 ​
 I used the "reset" command but there is no difference. Not sure what the reset command really do but it does not do a factory-reset which I want.
 Would appreciate any help or any guide you know of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a two customers experiencing the same issue and everything has led me to think it’s their network - probably because the way they’re putting together two ISP connections.
 I don’t know how it’s bonded though. It could be through a failover or load balanced. I don’t know. Anyhow, when I set SMTP settings into a MFP, only one email service provider works.
 Not Yahoo, not Gmail, not even the ISPs own email servers establish a connection. They all get timed out. There’s one email service provider that does work but the customers aren’t allowed to use that one because they aren’t paying for it.
 I increased the connection time. Tried multiple DNS. I’ve gone through the whole app passwords thing. I’ve gone through each port. I’ve tested through telnet with success. I also logged in each web portal site and can indeed send emails. I can even connect the MFP to a mobile network and send emails with any of those SMTP settings with no problem. Just not through their network except for that one email service provider. 
 Everything that makes sending emails through an MFP work should work, but doesn’t and it’s only happened with these two customers with their bonded network connections. What I think is happening is that the 250 OK isn’t coming back, so the MFP just gives up. 
 What can I ask them to look for when I visit them again? Should I ask to plug in and tracert, telnet, etc. from within? I get scared plugging into another’s network.
 I can’t ask if the prefix or suffix is being blocked, nor can I ask if the port is being blocked because that one email service provider works. It’s just all other ones don’t. ¯_(ツ)_/¯
 Sorry for the inconvenience.

 I have been assigned to replace the old cisco 3750 and 2960 switches with cisco 9200L series. 
 I have restored the cisco switches which are on the same model, but in this case the models are different. So, I am assuming that this might not be possible as there are differences in hardware and possbily OS version as well.
 What's the best way for the above situation? The old switches are still in production.
 Many thanks :)

 I'm an aspiring sysadmin and still need a lot to learn. That's why I'm making this thread. To collect knowledge from people that are smarter than me.
 Surely some of you have gotten to a point, at which you struggled to solve a certain problem. I noticed, that I often find myself in such scenarios, with no idea on how to address the issue.
 Are there a single or more processes a sysadmin can go through, to solve problems? I am willing and eager to learn, but I cant seem to find the thing I'm looking for. I know that there is no single way to solve all problems, but surely there has to be some kind of approach, to determine what the issue is, right? 
 I'll define what I would call a "process" using a problem, I've got to solve at the moment. 
 I've got VoIP PBX that works like it should, with one exception: the FAX service.
 Since the PBX doesnt send faxes like the old way, it receives an incoming fax , converts the content into a mail and sends the mail to the recipient. This stopped working a few days ago. 
 After a little search, I noticed that the mail server doesnt work anymore. The testmail results in an error message. So I changed it to a Google SMTP to check if the function still works, which it does. The testmail is send successfully, but someone never arrives. 
 Is there a way to check why my testmail does not arrive, and if yes, how?

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month's updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft's Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft's updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work.
 Test, test, and test!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My organization uses Knowbe4, and it's been a fantastic tool for simulating email phishes for our employees.
 I'm a little worried my elderly grandmother (who is around 80) and her ability to recognize a phish, so I was hoping to find a tool that I can use. My plan is to walk her through how the simulations will work and what she'll need to do, so I'm hoping for a tool that has a phish reporting mechanism (maybe forwarding an email to specific email address?) and is of low cost (or preferably free!)
 Does anyone know of any such offerings? Or maybe a bigger security company like Knowbe4 has a personal/family plan?

 EDIT; with guidance from our MSP we ran a Veeam restore of the DC. Veeam puts the restored DC in non-authoritative mode, after it grabs the latest AD info it switches out of that mode (I think!). Everything seems to be working fine. user logins/computer logins, dns, replication, all good. it's a 2012r2 that's going to be retired soon (with the rest of the 2012r2's in the world).

 WSUS was passed over for Intune, but Intune wasn't deployed when it was supposed to be. Therefore, as a stopgap, I'm being asked to use GPO to force feature updates.
 Many of our devices are stuck at 21h1 which was the version built into the image. Devices refuse to update to 21h2. The update doesn't even show when checking for updates. However, downloading and running the installer tool allows it to install without issue.
 Has anyone seen this before? I ran the troubleshooter and it can't figure it out either.
 I wrote the GPO to force-check updates and update to at least 21h2 with business hours excluded and different settings for mandatory restarts etc.
 If this fails, aside from going machine to machine, I'm at a loss...

I am not a networking guy; I knew that it would not be as easy as plugging the switch in an it would work immediately - but I also didn't realize that I needed to build an operating system to make it work At the moment I have a $10,000 door stop; I have cloned the onie repo and attempted to build for Mellanox and then I started working through issues (this library isn't installed, that tool isn't installed..) for about 1.5 hours before reaching an error indicating that I should not be a root user, but then nothing works unless I am root so...?? In looking through the onie repo the SN2100 isn't even listed as supported hardware and it hasn't been updated for 5-8 years. 
 Is there an image on the switch that works somewhere, or is this something that everyone has to deal with? How do I get an OS that is made for the switch and works properly?
 It seems crazy to me that a company would sell a product that is so expensive and then just have a pointer to an open source project and not even say "good luck, have fun! lol". :(

 I tried Ethtool on kali, but due to my NIC not being compatible - it fails to work.
 As stated - quick and dirty is okay here - I just want to connect to a live ethernet line and force the port it connects to to blink at a consistent rate. I have used tool that do this in the past, but was hoping something could be done with bash or PowerShell.
 ​
 Thank you in advanced for any help you may provide!
 ​
 edit: to clarify, one of this reason I am not using switching functions is because the hardware may all be unmanaged, and if it is managed - I will not have the credentials. Additionally, I know one goal is to identify why some APs are offline - if the cable is live but PoE is not being provided, I want to be able to find the other end of the cable.

 I am reviewing the power loss prevention strategy at a client site due to a severe power outage we had over the weekend that caused issues and the UPS did not pick up the slack quickly enough. I am reviewing the UPS situation so this question is solely looking at the R220 server.
 The server we have is an R220 with the H310 raid controller and Write Through enabled.
 Since Write Through is enabled there should be minimal loss (if any) during a power outage. Is there any advantage (other than performance) for upgrading the H310 to an H710P with a battery? Or does the advantage only come into play when Write Back is turned on?
 TLDR: If I have write through turned on with an H310, does upgrading to an H710P with a battery (with write through remaining on, NOT write back), do we gain any additional power loss protection?

 I'm a bit stuck on this one and any assistance would be amazing. I'm very much an Nginx noob.
 We have an existing Nginx setup with lots of redirections already configured.
 I'm trying to only redirect one subdomain in Nginx to an external url, however no matter what I try it redirects all subdomains. 
 I've reviewed our existing configs to get some understanding of how things are setup but the life of me I just can't work this one out and all the search results I seem to find are for redirecting all subdomains or sub sites not for redirecting just one subdomain of many.
 This subdomain didn't have an existing config and I've had to create one (copy one of our others and edit it) it looks like previously the subdomain was configured under a catch all.
 Example:
 I need https://foo-bar.test.com.au to redirect to https://externalURL.com
 However I don't want https://other-site.test.com.au to redirect to https://externalURL.com
 This is the current config
 ******************************************************************
 server {
 server_name foo-bar.test.com.au;
 rewrite ^ https://externalURL.com;
 root /opt/nginx-static/foo-bar;
 }
 ​
 server {
 listen 443 ssl http2;
 server_name foo-bar.test.com.au;
 rewrite ^/(.*)$ https://externalURL;
 ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/foo-bar.crt;
 ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/foo-bar.key;
 ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
 ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;
 ssl_session_timeout 30m;
 root /opt/nginx-static/foo-bar;
 ​
 location / {
 root /opt/nginx-static/foo-bar;
 index index.html foo-bar.html;
 autoindex on;
 }

 For the purpose of the network, the AirFibre is like having an Ethernet cable between the two locations.
 Each of the two locations will have - Router - Switch - Separate and dedicated ISP internet connection
 Between these two locations, I would like to: - Access network resources that exist on either network - Use the other internet service as a backup
 My questions: 
  
How could I interconnect this? 
 What rules would I need to use?
  
Would: - “wireless cable 1” connect from network switch and LAN from office A to office B router - “wireless cable 2” from from network switch and LAN of office B to the office A router - setup a static route for the other office LAN on each office router to pass through the wireless link and to the other router - have a rule that passes WAN traffic normally through the local ISP, and through the wireless link interface if the ISP is down

 We have replaced the keyboard, mouse, and then the entire computer. The new PC was a clean image on a brand new computer taken out of the box for this. 
 The shift lock affects local physical users and remote control users over ConnectWiseControl. 
 At this point, I figure it has to be either some device plugged in that is screwing with the keyboard (this controls special hardware), or a bug in some piece of software needed on this computer. 
 We do not see this with otherwise identical computers and configurations around the org.
 We're going to try disconnecting all USB devices except for mouse and keyboard and see if it goes away, and do the old add them back one by one. But I had the idea that if there was something like Wireshark for USB, especially keyboard commands, it might narrow this down vs just blindly plugging things in.

The sheer terror that you might take something down just by tugging on the wrong cable. Love it. This is one of things i like most about my job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just had the scariest 30 minutes.
 I'm at the office and decide to check my gmail and see that my NAS at home has been disconnected from the internet since midday. I figure our home internet has dropped out or there's been a power cut so decide to try and connect to the NAS over the internet anyway.
 Oh. It's up. That's weird. Why is it saying it's disconnected from the Internet then? Ah well, let's login and see what's going on. Enter credentials, enter the MFA code and "The verification code is incorrect"
 Um. WTF? Try a couple more times and MFA simply isn't working. There's no other admin account to login to (default admin account is disabled - I'm not a total idiot. Yes, yes I know, exposing NAS to the internet etc etc).
 I get my son, who's at home, to reboot the NAS hoping it's a temporary blip. Nope. Still cannot login as the MFA code isn't working.
 At this point my imagination is running wild and I'm assuming that it's been hacked and the MFA for my admin account has been reset to the hacker's phone. Other normal user accounts (non-MFA) are working. The data is still there, no encrypted files or anything else untoward seems to be going on. So, what the hell? 
 I check Synology forums and see posts about the time sync possibly being off but that isn't the case. I'm on the verge of asking my son to press the dreaded Reset button when I have a thought. I have a Active Directory domain at home and a single Zetec mini-PC box acting as DC. This also provides DNS for the home network. It couldn't be that could it? Why would that affect MFA on the NAS? 
 I get my son to check if the Zetec box is on. It wasn't. Soon as that was powered up and the DNS services started, MFA started working again. 
 Bloody DNS man....

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a temporary setup for allowing multiple network clients to access a shared VPN resource. I have a Windows PC connected to the internet and sharing it's VPN connection to a switch over ethernet and it's working very well for all connected devices. I've used this setup before and it's easy with everything else I have running. Right now, it's all wired. 
 My question is: if that were to be shared on open wifi instead of ethernet, what dangers to the host/"main" network would there be?
 I know that if I were using a normal router for this, I'd be concerned they would navigate to 192.168.1.1, enter a correct password or bypass an insecure login page, and wreak havok. So I would know that I need a secure router and a good password or I could put management on another VLAN. 
 I'm aware of possible concerns about peer security. Client isolation will be enabled in the access point to this network. 
 What concerns are there with Windows ICS "acting as the router"? Can clients configure ICS settings or somehow reach the Windows PC's primary LAN? Would they be able to send commands to the Windows PC?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently we are using a virtual data room solution that costs $6,000 for 2GB of storage and an additional $2000 per GB, so I am up to $8k annually. That seems really insane to me, and we are likely going to need to increase it to 4GB totaling 10K annually.
 I looked at other cloud storage solution providers, and for example, Box.com's Enterprise plan will allow me to only need to license internal users and all external users are free.
 With that, I could seemingly achieve the same thing for $2500 (5-6 internal users) instead of $8000. Not only that, but it includes unlimited storage as well which is a HUGE selling point to me.
 My use of our current data room solution solely exists to provide company financial files to investors. All that I need is activity audit logging, MFA, and granular permissions. It's used maybe once a year for a month or so during investor rounds, which makes the price tag even more painful.
 While we have SharePoint, I keep SharePoint use to internal only because its confusing to people, permission management is a PITA with external users, and audit reporting is no easy feat. I also want that clear delineation to employees to understand internal and external. I am just saying this so that I am not asked why I don't just use SharePoint for this.
 Is there something missing that I don't understand between the definition of a "data room" and just normal cloud storage setup to share with external/guest users?
 If you go look at Citrix ShareFile, theres specifically a data room tier that drops you from unlimited storage to 5GB of storage, and costs $448 a MONTH. Why is that a thing??
 Thanks!
 ​
 Edit: Based on the comments explaining the differences, it seems like we may be using a data room when we don't really need one for our specific purposes. I'll evaluate the other options. Thank you for the clarification!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings folks, 
 I just wanted to ask your feedback on this situation:
 I've been hired as a network engineer at a mid sized hospital organization, that also is looking for sysadmins.
 In the meantime, after working on network related tasks for about 8 months, I've been asked to assist with server security remediation. It's been understood that it's not a typical job role, but the whole IS team has been chipping in here and there and I certainly don't mind it given that its not all that much work.
 However, some of the maintenance cycles are scheduled for 10pm, on two Saturdays, and at 4am on the following two Sundays. 
 My question is, what server can possibly need to be updated at 4 in the morning? What's wrong with running both cycles simultaneously at 8pm during weekdays?
 Has anyone encountered this and can give any insight?
 Thanks!

 Someone said just use the phone hotspot.

I can ingress the domain and use any W10/W11 21H2 machine with no issues, and can ingress (using domain credentials) onto the domain with the 22H2 machine, but when I try to login with ANY domain user, it says the password is incorrect.
 I've set the minimum SMB version as SMB2 on Zentyal, but it didn't fix the issue.
 I'm not sure what can I do to investigate the issue further, as I don't receive eny error code.
 Does anyone have any suggestions on how to track the cause of the issue? 
 Edit: Seems it's related to this bug 15197 – Windows 11 22H2 and Samba-AD 4.15 Kerberos login issue with the solution being setting up a separate samba server for 22H2 machines, or not updating to 22h2 until the next Zentyal version releases. Fuck me

 a certain user experiences problems whenever he logs into the terminal server and does a query which produces a huge amount of rows. The query just crashes his whole desktop and file system.

 I also can't access his virtual hard drive as the path can't be found. The only solution is to log him out with task manager and relog into the server. 
 Is it possible that this could have something to do with too little memory on our volume? There are only a couple of MB left and this is the volume where all our virtual hard disks are stored.

 Our Org is planing to move direction cloud and implementing the usage of Microsoft 365 Services.
 One Point to calculate is backup. I am trying to find a good solution that is price effective. Actually i'm looking at some solutions like avepoint, Veeam, you name it ... there are dozens of BaaS (Backup as a Service) solutions out there. In a nutshell all works similar you pay per user and Month - and i don't like it this way. Call me Old bastard if you want :) 
 Later i stumbled across Synology "Active Backup for Microsoft 365". An app running on your local NAS (synology ones obviously). If i understood right, there is no additional licencing beside of "owning a compatible NAS". We have allready some of this maschines running without any trouble/issues for year as Cheap local Backup Storage Targets. 
 For me, there are two main important things. 1) Price and 2) Stability of the product. And i like to have backups "on-prem" the "classic" way (3 times and different places). 
 Now im wondering if i find here some "real life" Opinions about this setup? Any good for an organisation with 150 Users? 
 Thanx!

 The URL follows the same preset
 https://website.com/key=xxxxxx-0000-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx
 x = numbers and small letters
 0 = numbers only
 ​
 Backstory:
 At my work we use this internal service. To log in, we are given a URL with a random key. The key stays the same the whole time you work here. They claim this is secure because the key is random. But i cant possible think this is secure. I have confirmed with my colleage that if i use his link. I log on as him.
 This is not intended to be nefarious, but to prove its not as secure as they think it is and hopefully get them to change it.

 i have some troubels with the Printer Rolle on Server 2019. The installed Drivers are from Konica Minolta and Up to date, the Printers are allready Installed, ant The Windows Updates are up to date. The same Printers are woking on my 2016 Server but we want a migratopn to 2019 Server. The Problem is, I can Print a Test page from each Server directly (2016 & 2019) but from my client ( Windows 10 ) i can normaly connect an view all settings with the printer, but i cant print on the 2019 Server.
 The 2019 Serve Log is:
 📷
 "Event 812: Printer Service
 "The printer spooler failed to delete C:\Spool\\FP00001.SHD, Error Code 0x2"
 ​
 ServerLOG
 The Folder hast NTFS Permisions for Full Control on - System -> Creator -> Users
 The Settings are the same and the NTFS is the same as on the 2016 Server, no changes.
 On The Client i got a Error:
 (Error 0x00000bbb) The operation could not be completed. No print job could be created.
 Can anyone help me, any ideas or anything similar to watch for ?
 Thanks and BR

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We use a Windows 2016 server to run print jobs for our ERP system. All printing is direct - no print servers/sharing involved.
 For the past year, it seems like about 50% of Microsoft's updates breaks our printers. The exact scenario is: post-update, about 90% of the printers will have been defaulted to duplex printing, and about 90% of the printers will be using the generic Microsoft printer driver. (Note that these two groups do not always overlap; sometimes a printer will still have the correct driver, but will have been changed to duplex printing, or vice-versa.) This is not printer or driver specific; it occurs across several different makes/models and drivers.
 Fixing it is a relatively simple, but frustrating process: Just go into each printer's "Advanced > Printing Defaults..." and disable duplex. Afterwards, both issues will be resolved.
 We attempted to resolve this with a simple bit of Powershell, set to run (as admin) on system startup:
  $printers = Get-Printer foreach($printer in $printers){ Set-PrintConfiguration -PrinterName $printer.name -DuplexingMode 'OneSided' } 
 However, Set-PrinterConfiguration only works after the printer has been manually fixed. Otherwise, it generates the following error:
  Set-PrintConfiguration : Could not access configuration information for the specified printer. At C:\Scripts\Set_SingleSidedPrinting.ps1:7 char:5 + Set-PrintConfiguration -PrinterName $printer.name -DuplexingMode ... + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ + CategoryInfo : ObjectNotFound: (MSFT_PrinterConfiguration:ROOT/StandardCi...erConfiguration) [Set-PrintConfiguration], CimException + FullyQualifiedErrorId : HRESULT 0x80070002,Set-PrintConfiguration 
 Very frustrating. Any ideas how to resolve things? Either so that Windows Updates no longer cause the printing issue, or so that our script can reliably run, post-update?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I swear i'm going insane and it shouldn't be that hard.
 The "new" Windows Terminal is everything i want. Except, sometimes, pasting passwords over SSH plain won't work. Pasting the Password without a sudo prompt or such shows the correct text, but when asked for a password by ansible or sudo, only typing does it. No idea why. It has also been laggy when connected to Servers with a less than ideal connection. Not sure why my Input depends on the connection to the customer?
 So, suffice to say, i'm not happy with windows Terminal. Alacritty does everything great, except it doesn't have tabs.
 Putty also doesn't have tabs plus it's session management is... less than ideal.
 So, what do i do? My requirements are pretty basic. All Windows stuff can be done through PS. So all i really need is something that can do SSH, Tabs, maybe split windows. Stored sessions are a nice to have, but i'm fine copy pasting IPs and using my SSH config. Right Click Paste would be nice, but Ctrl+V works too. It should use Windows' build in OpenSSH, not putty and Pageant. Other than that, it should be responsive and work as expectet 100% of the time.
 What do those of you that Use SSH for admin tasks all day, but also need to use Windows, use?

I'd be up at 7:00 am, I'd be scripting, I'd be documenting, I'd be on calls helping out people, I'd be helping teammates even if they didn't ask for it, I'd volunteer for tasks, I'd be working late or on the weekends trying to get something done or working the way I wanted it.
 Now? Fuck all that.
 I did that for years, and I'd see people getting promoted and then try to figure out what I did wrong. Or at the end of the year my review comes back with all 'meets', and just get the standard raise. At my third job, it hit me like a baseball in the nuts with a simple comment from another co-worker. 
 "Why, the boss didn't tell me to do it"
 It's that simple. All your manager is interested in is that you getting done what he or she assigned to you. Spending 12 hours making sure that documentation is just right might get you a "good job" comment from the manager and might get you the recognization of being a good document writer but you know what a quick bullet list you did in 20 minutes will tick that task complete and that is what your manager is interested in
 After I got that concept through my head my life in IT became a cakewalk and more important my salary has tripled over the past 10 years (and pretty much no overtime). 
 That's not to say I don't do anything extra. I spend a fair amount of time studying but I take a two-pronged approach. First, learn what is needed for the current job, the processes, the tech stack, the DBs etc. That is usually a month or two then, as I like to change jobs or get promoted every 2 or max 3 years I start studying for the job I want next. 
 I no longer waste my time trying to be the go-getter, the superstar, or that person everyone goes to for the answers cause at the end of the day it's just a job and I'm going to get paid the same to write an amazing doc or a bulleted list.
 Also, remember the rule of 5. How will it affect you in 5 minutes, 5 weeks, 5 months, or 5 years?

 Since this is affecting presumably the entire state, I doubt anything will change to fix it.
 My question though is... why? An ISP phone technician will be unlikely to tell me, so I'm just curious if there would be any likely cause for these issues? Are they doing updates to their routers that just randomly knocks everyone off the Internet deep at night?
 I'm also curious if anyone else has had experiences like this themselves?

 One lady with poor vision almost crying when I took a screen magnifier to her and set it up, who just stared at it going "wow" over and over with a huge smile.
 The kids with learning disabilities who got touch screen iMacs which blew their mind and who wrote a theme some (based on Batman) which they sang anytime they saw me.
 The doctor who actually got down on his knees and kissed my feet (I was with a colleague at the time) after I fixed his long-problematic monitor issues (it was literally 5 mins to download/reinstall an Nvidia driver). He said he'd had over a dozen calls and six IT staff at his computer by this point.
 I'm going to be honest I'm easily pleased but when you do make a difference and see that impact on someone else it reminds some of us why we chose to work in support.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just implemented all the Anti-Phishing policies/security recommendations etc that Microsoft added in September.
 I've got 99,4% of my users "affected by policies that are configured securely".
 But I've got 0.6% of my users " affected by policies that are configured less securely than is recommended ". 
 How do I go about finding these users? 
 Are there any good or efficient way of finding these users?
 I'm just thinking there's something I'm missing here:

 They even list how many users that are affected by the wrong (Default) policies. So my thinking is that I should be able to find these users in a list somehow.

 Head Office (HO): Sophos XGS Firewall (For troubleshooting all security between the two offices is temporarily disabled)
 Branch Office (BO): Mikrotik 915G
 IPSEC configured between the sites.
 Printers at the branch office are connected via the VPN to the windows terminal server located in HO.
 BO staff connect to HO Terminal server and print documents from their application to their local printers. Printing is taking about 1 minute per page 200kb(according to the spooler) to print. The connectivity appears stable and i dont see packet loss across the link and there is about 70ms between the two. I've performed packet captures from the BO Side and the HO Side. I was hoping to get some indication of where and if the fault is with the link. Also note, we have 3 other BO's connected to the HO with the exact same setup and no performance issues.
 After the initial handshake i see a large number of retransmissions from the HO Side with ACKs from the printer in the BO. This continues for about 15 seconds before a number of back and forwards of packets . After this, 10 seconds of what appears to be healthy communication occurs. I get a TCP Window full from the HO server to the BO Printer. The as well the ad the retransmissions and dup ACK returning. It continues this way for the next 20 seconds before a another flood of what appears to be healthy PSH/ACK communication. Finally ending in the FIN/ACK.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. Just a stupid question.
 I have multiple VMs running in an isolated network and want them to isolate, but I'd like to access them through the VPN connection. So as a solution I'm going to use one VM with the public IP, set up a firewall, and OpenVPN server. Also, I'm going to add authentication for the OpenVPN through the OpenLDAP server and redirect all routing for the VMs from the isolated network using this primary VM. So this primary VM will work as a router.
 So what kind of OS should I use for it?
 For now, I have created an ansible playbook that set up everything required using Ubuntu Server LTS. But I've read that Ubuntu is OS for the users and it's better to use BSD family OSes like OpenBSD, FreeBSD, or even OPNsense for the network devices.

 We've been using the Windows Server CIS L1 benchmarks for a while, but are now looking to roll them out to some Citrix servers. On the surface nothing in the benchmark policies seem problematic for users, but I'm concerned that there may be additional User Rights Assignment type permissions required in the Citrix context.
 Has anyone used the CIS policies in a Citrix environment and can speak to any issues, or alterations they had to make to the policies to allow things to work properly?

 "With backup schedule set to Hourly, the default selection for start time is 8 AM, schedule is Every 4 hours, and duration is 24 Hours. Hourly backup has a minimum RPO of 4 hours and a maximum of 24 hours. You can set the backup schedule to 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours respectively."
 Recovery point objective (RPO): The amount of acceptable data loss if a recovery needs to be done
 Azure support hourly VM backup, however their RPO indicates that the schedule is a minimum of every 4 hours.
 So is a backup performed every 1 or 4 hours? Or are they saying that even through you've set to hourly we will only guarantee a backup every 4 hours? If so than that's somewhat poor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We live in Canada and the last couple of Winters we have been getting more and more power losses due to storms. We average about 10-15 over the Fall/Winter season, and they often last for several hours.
 I recently identified an issue with a UPS we have (Cyberpower) where it does not take over immediately upon power loss, so the last few winters when I thought it was taking over, our Dell PowerEdge R220 server has been shutting off (not gracefully) every power outage.
 I am working on getting a good UPS in place with network SNMP traps that is more reliable -- thinking Tripp Lite as I have had good luck with them in the past. Let me know if there is anything specific I should be looking for when it comes to UPS purchases for a small server rack for a local business with a server, NAS, modem, and a couple other small devices.
 I was thinking something along the lines of https://www.cdw.ca/product/tripp-lite-1000va-ups-smart-avr-w-installed-webcardlx-1urm/3826234?pfm=srh
 For the server itself... we currently have WD GOLD 3.5" Enterprise HDD in there. Would there be any advantage to power loss data prevention by switching to the WD GOLD SSD with the power loss prevention feature? I have been looking for an excuse to move them over to SSDs, but only if it is a good safe guard against power loss. I know standard SSDs are not good for power loss protection, but are SSDs with power loss protection any better than the WD GOLD Enterprise HDDs I mentioned?
 The server we have also has an H310 raid controller and I was wondering if switching to H710p would offer any advantages to maintaining data integrity during a power outage? I understand the performance and IOPS difference between the two but not sure if one is better than the other for handling power loss.
 There's lots more info I could provide but just doing a quick write up for now.

 I work for a mid size documentary company in NYC. For the last two years our data closet has sat gathering dust, and I got fed up with a perfectly good 80TB of shared storage sitting unused. So I took a photo of all the various serial numbers, brute-forced the passwords (they were all the defaults - go figure), and bought the company’s first PC to see what I could do.
 Here’s a list of the equipment on our rack from top to bottom: - D-Link DGS-1210-16 (not connected to anything) - 24-port RJ45 patch box (connected to below switch, labeled “LAN”) with cat6 cables running to stations - HP1920-48G network switch (labeled “LAN S”) - 24-port RJ45 patch box (connected to below switch, labeled “PHONE”, the phones and their breadboard-looking-box have been removed) - CISCO Catalyst switch (Labeled “PHONE S”) - NETGEAR ProSafe XS712T switch (with one fiber expansion port, connected via fiber to NAS, and Ethernet to LAN, second NAS) - 24-port RJ45 patch box with mix of Cat 5e, 6, and 6e ports that run to CAT7 cables to edit stations - Synology DS1618+ - Synology DS3617xs
 My goal is to get an office network up and running with the CAT7 lines running 10Gb to edit stations and Cat6 lines running 1Gb to producers stations. From there, I want to host a server for Signiant Media Shuttle that will allow my NAS both through my router’s firewall and to the office network. I presume this means it all has to go through either the 10Gb or 1Gb switch (or both?). My office has 1Gb fiber through Verizon, and we have their router.
 If anyone out there has any advice for me, or can point me to good resources, I would greatly appreciate it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All,
 What are some good places where I could do the odd weekend or evening working remotely freelance? I moved jobs a few months ago from a hands on technical role with a very broad skill set to more of a team lead / architect role in the cloud space. I honestly miss jumping from fixing a broken DC to patching a RHEL template to creating new segments in NSX-T. I can also feel my broad skill set fading away already and I don’t like the idea of being an IT manager in 10 years time struggling to remember what DNS does!
 So do you any of you do any remote freelance work at the weekend and if so how can I get involved? I only see it as a win win, it keeps my skills sharp and I’m getting paid!
 Thanks for your replies

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I have a mostly WFH job in IT which requires the occasional local onsite visit. However, recently my company have mentioned they want to potentially send me to a large city that is roughly 6 hours away (flying or driving, all travel is expensed) for a week out of every month for a project that’s expected to last a year or longer. 
 Travel time are hours that go on the timesheet to make up my 40 hours for the week. A hotel and car will be provided. All work related expenses can be expensed if I provide a receipt. If driving my own car, I can expense the gas at .55c/km, which adds a nice small bump to my pay cheques.
 My main concern is that a quarter of my year will be spent away from home and family. I don’t have kids, only a girlfriend who would miss me being home but can deal with it. After a while, I don’t think I will really be able to enjoy my leisure time when the day is finished if I cannot go home to relax. 
 It would be a decent learning experience but it’s experience I could get locally as well. I make under $60k CAD (~45k USD) in Ontario.
 I enjoy my job but feel they are asking a bit much of me. My boss implied that travel is part of the job but I feel that there needs to be additional monetary compensation.
 Do any of you guys receive compensation for this type of extended travel for long projects? What do you think should I be asking for? Is it just part of the job? 
 Thanks in advance for any input.

 I'm getting some envy of people who get to do this everyday. Network Engineering seems to have a limit of how creative you can be. A lot of what I do is troubleshooting and proving the network is not the cause of X issue. It would be nice to not have to answer to end users and just focus on building stuff.
 Has anyone else felt this way? Maybe this is just a grass is always greener situation. I'm in my mid-30's and feel like I'm too old to transition to SE.

Tried a packet capture but don't really see any traffic going to the IP the domain resolves too. The site works fine outside the network. I have contacted them to see if they have any clue why.

He said that I should be monitoring tickets and emails. And I am infringing on what we spoke about when I got my warning. My phone hasn't rung and my work phone was charging. Also my normal phone has a problem where every hour or so I get notifications in waves and doesn't help the fact that we have a shared inbox that once someone else reads it the notification goes away. But I feel like I am on call and I am salary isn't this wrong that I have to be checking emails and tickets even if I don't receive a call?

 I was wondering if anyone could think of a good way how I can give those people more access to their own WordPress sites without giving them access to the server or other people's sites with the least work for me. I was thinking of deploying WordPress and MySQL in a docker container and just installing ssh in that docker container so everyone could access their own container?

 I have to write a document describing IT infrastructure of a real-world company/business including hardware, software, network components and deciding whether to use cloud infrastructure or tradition infrastructure with on premises servers. I decided to choose car dealership company which would be small and more specific to design. We are allowed to design it as we think rather than finding the actual infrastructure of the chosen company. My chosen company is John Hughes which is a car dealership business here Australia, Perth, WA. 
 Any input on how to approach the design, components to think of and what components or how actual IT infrastructure looks like for a car dealership business would be highly appreciated. They would need support for inventory management, sales, customer relations but what else should I be thinking of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking into this for a while now, and still coming up short. We're a non-profit in a small country with horrible internet access. Our 4 locations are basically small, gated cities. The big center has essentially the leadership (government), a medical clinic, a store, a school, and 70 residences. Nearby is the airport and aviation team. The other 3 remote locations are each about 10 homes and an office. Each center relies on a single internet connection for everything (houses, et al) at that location.
 We have an IT team of only 6, all at the central location. Our documentation is old, disorganized, and thus hard to go through and find what you need. I think we're making progress though.
 Computers are a mixed bag of domain computers and BYOD. Letting a tool scan the network has always given unwieldy results or so many results there's not a clue where to start.
 The issue is that we have no idea WHAT we're managing, and that needs to change. We've setup a trial of iDoit and had a go. It's a nice tool, but perhaps too manual. We have PRTG that can help, but it's got so many alarms from "false" devices found during the auto-scan.
 The question is...what are others using for inventory and documentation? I'm looking for a tool that can tell me what devices are where with what configuration. Hopefully, something that can schedule maintenance and show a change history.
 I've been googleing on and off for months, finding a lot of sales pitches and promises. Maybe a short trial, maybe not. I'm hoping that by asking here, perhaps the options can be twiddled down to a good couple instead of what I'm (not) finding.

 I have successfully completed it as directed in the guide. The emails are being received on Gmail. However, my emails sent from custom email addresses are going to junk (outlook) and promotional tab (Gmail).
 I think the problem here is: DKIM record. I don't think Google allows to access the keys for a simple Gmail user. One has to sign in to Workspace which I think is not free.
 I have tested with an email tester.
 https://app.mailgenius.com/spam-test/5ecbb9
 How do I proceed with this?
 My goal is:
  
To send/receive domain emails on Gmail instead of using a custom SMTP.
 I prefer the freebie approach. Do let me know if there's any free SMTP that allows sending around 3000 emails/month.

 I used virtual box, made two virtual machines as per their requirements and enabled "share display" in them and it worked. But it has 1 second input lag and i couldn't lower it.

 They've been licensed since day one, we use an assortment of Basic/Standard M365 licenses, they've never been deactivated or stripped of their license.
 The only thing that comes to mind and they have in common is every single one of them has had their licensing upgraded from Basic to Standard at some point.
 Everyone on the initial license plan is not affected, they have their Teams according to their M365 license.
 Has anyone encountered this behaviour? I'm not able to reproduce it while switching licensing plans for a user.

 Build a nonblocking and Fault-Tolerant network that accommodates 10,000 servers equipped with two 10Ge NICs.
 ​
 My answer, 
 To make it Fault-Tolerant I will have two routers between the routers on the client side and the external router which will be connected with other ASs. Configure one as the active and the other as the standby. The two routers will use Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol to achieve this.
 I wasn't able to say anything about which product to use so I said any router and switch that has 10Ge ports.

 Actual cell service has been getting worse and worse, especially since the 5G rollout. Anyone else notice this too? 
 T-Mobile is offering us and a buddy of mine in charge of a similar size account some unbeatable deals and savings to switch over to them. I’m a little reluctant because historically TMO has had less than great coverage than the big 2. But I think that has changed, at least from the testing I have done, I’m seeing better speeds and better coverage in most areas now. We do work all over our state, so it’s important that we have good coverage. 
 Am I making a mistake switching over to a smaller provider? Do you think I’ll have to deal with backlash? 
 My idea is to switch over 100+ iPads first since data on those isn’t a deal breaker like it would be for voice service. And do remote monitoring to see what the signal is in the areas we work, then if it’s a good fit, change over our smartphones. 
 Anyone else switch their company over and do you have any regrets?
 I don’t consider AT&T a viable option at this point as their 5G rollout is so far behind and I did a bunch of testing last year and was not impressed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've just had a new CCTV Camera system added to our corporate WLAN by an external 3rd party vendor. The system streams 12 odd cameras to a heads-up display. Its scope was to be viewed on a wired device at a Station but it's found its way to mobile devices (Tablets/Laptops) due to the flexibility and convenience this offers. Unfortunately, it doesn't optimize video well and is constantly eating around 100 Mbps (or more) per client. Our Wireless network is a Cisco-based WLC /w 802.11ac WAPs using 20 MHz wide channels for 2.4/5 GHz. So we're really only good for about 100 Mbps half-duplex. 
 I've been doing some thinking about the problem and I cannot see if we can resolve this with the current Wireless setup even if we moved to wider channel widths or newer 802.11 technology. Not only would wider channels hurt the setup of the entire building but even with 2 clients, we're going to have sub-optimal performance for all other clients in that airspace.
 Am I just underestimating the performance of the newer standard 802.11ac/802.11ax, or is this use-case better suited for Wired?

 Is it not designed to allow multiple SRPs and everything is supposed to be in one? One of them applies to a wider user base than the other, which is why there are two separate GPOs.
 Edit: I see that it is actually allowed but happens when it thinks there is a conflict so the better question is- why does it think there is a conflict? One of them is the path to Firefox, the other is the path to Zoom. Two different locations entirely. I'm not understanding where the conflict is.

 Your employer wants to let you walk after resigning? You thing they are idiots for letting you go? You think they can’t survive without you? You “built it with your barehands” and they can’t figure out your expert work? You think that matters? You think you can get a big payday by "sticking around" if you negotiate?
 If you believe for a second that a former employer, who screwed you over and underpaid you, will be kinder to you as a contractor? You are wrong. You are living a fantasy if you believe it.
 So, just ask them for $200 per hour to help them after you go. Easy money and you’ll show them how important you are. You’ll make a fortune proving them wrong. What can go wrong?

 I see that thoses services are not launching ; Windows time (error 1792) Netlogon (error 1068) Workstation (error 1068)
 Its the only DC what should i do ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have set up DNS entry (with Route53) for *.tunnel.example.com and tunnel.example.com to point to 2 IPs of 2 different VMs for high availability, example 1.1.1.1 and 2.2.2.2 . nginx as a reverse proxy is installed on both
 So when I enter app1.tunnel.example.com sometimes it is redirected to 1.1.1.1 server and sometimes to 2.2.2.2
 app1.tunnel.example.com, app2.tunnel.example.com..etc are dynamically generated, these are tunnels to privateIP exposed service, and the other end of the tunnel, the publicIP part from which you have access on the internet, is either server-1 1.1.1.1 or server-2 2.2.2.2, depending on which IP tunnel.example.com DNS has returned (load balancing between the 2 IPs)
 My problem is that sometimes the tunnel for app1.tunnel.example.com is on Server 1, but when acessing this host, the loadbalancer routes this traffic to server 2, and it results on an error
 I have actually made nginx reverse proxy to the end of the tunnel, sith proxy_pass
 What I want, I don't know if it's possible with Nginx, is if the proxied server returns 404 on server 1, then re-route the request to the other nginx reverse-proxy server 2, but the URL has to remain app1.tunnrl.example.com on the search bar, 
 is it even networkingly possible? If yes and nginx is not the answer, then what could it be?
 Below is How I want the nginx.conf to look like on server1:
 Server { Listen 80; Location / { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4444/; proxy_intercept_error on; } error_page 404 = @redirect; location @redirect { return 301 http://$host ON 2.2.2.2; #host here is app1.tunnel.example.com } } 
 Thank you, hope it was clear

We have a company first this weekend as we find ourselves having to investigate an employee of wrongdoing (nothing illegal as of this moment). We believe this to be fairly standard misconduct and to be a fireable offense that will be proven quickly upon investigating the employee's emails and files. Since this is my first time, what are some things to look out for? Legal issues we may run into? Best practices for this? How and when should I limit management access? I would even welcome personal experiences. Essentially everything we uncover and how we do it will be establishing our written policy that we should already have lol.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone here have any familiarity with setting this up?
 I've just started a new job in a busy hospital laboratory, and sooo much time could be saved if the normal values just auto-verified in the computer without a lab tech having to pull it up in the computer, scan it, then hit verify to send the results to the EMR. Right now, only some of their chemistry tests auto-verify, so I know it's possible. I'm gathering that the IT department there is notoriously slow (likely understaffed and not exactly giving priority to some lab passion project, understandably).
 Lab is on Cerner Millenium. I'm assuming that the set-up for this occurs in Cerner, but how? I've been taking some basic developing courses and would be happy to do this on the side as a portfolio project, but I don't even know if that's possible or where to start. Obviously I'd have to talk to IT at some point but hoping to get some input here before I even bring it up (in case it's absolutely crazy).
 As a side note, their Cepheid (COVID instrument) is not interfaced to Cerner at all, so they're manually typing in the 100s of Flu/COVID/RSVs they get in a day and then having a 2nd tech do a clerical check, which is absolutely bananas for the volume they get. If anyone knows where to start on that one as well, I'd love to attempt to tackle it if it's even remotely possible.
 TIA (and sorry if this is the wrong sub - I also posted in r/healthIT but not sure if that was right either - please redirect me)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm a hardware engineer at some company. We have a device we collect data with that spits data out to a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi has compiled code on it that saves the data to its local files and sends these files back to a lab PC over a closed wifi network. None of these devices are connected to the internet.
 During our testing, we're using Matlab to perform our testing procedures. Our auxiliary hardware is all reliant on proprietary Matlab drivers.
 To send commands to the RPi, we currently use Matlab to make a system call to Putty, which SSH's into the RPi and executes local code on the RPi. We need to do this hundreds of times per test, and it currently takes a couple seconds per Putty call, so the time stacks up. To push/pull files off the RPi, we have Matlab make a system call to an SFTP server.
 My question is: how would you execute the commands on the RPi faster than making system calls to Putty? My scenario to test speed is to execute a copy file command from Matlab 20 times, and time the results. Number to beat is about 40 seconds for those 20 copies. I've tried using the Paramiko library in Python, but it was slower than Putty. I've also tried using a 3rd party Matlab plugin based around the Ganymede Java library, but there's some problem with keys on our model of Rpi, even when I manually try to add keys to the RPi. My next move is a Python library called ssh2-python, but I need to get Visual on the lab PC, which will take some time given our IT situation.
 I was also toying with the idea of using TCP sockets in either Python or C++, but I'm not really familiar with TCP. I'm not a network person, so I'm kind of blindly stumbling from potential solution to potential solution. Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I‘m currently playing around with TLS ans self-signed certificates for internal services. There are quite a lot of tutorials on how to generate a root ca and an intermediate CA, while there are also Howtos for generating TLS certificates.
 As far as I understood, you sign the CSR of your intermediate by your root ca and your SSL csr by your intermediate CA. You import and trust the root ca and every certificate signed by the intermediate should be trusted too.
 Well. That doesn’t work. If I, for example, check the certificate of google with MacOS Certificate Assistant, the whole chain of trust is visible. If I check my certificate, I only see the TLS cert and the assistant cries about the untrusted intermediate certificate.
 It looks like the chain between root and intermediate is broken. If read the Wikipedia article about x509 and the lead me to more questions. It looks like the certificate only contents some basic information about it’s ca (in my case the intermediate) like public key ,algorithm, etc. but no information about the root ca. How ist my browser supposed to know who signed the intermediate ?
 Or is the information on Wikipedia not complete and I have to bundle the CAs certificates with my TLS cert ?
 I have an headache now. Please help me.

 At my job, I'm in charge of developing a solution to a very disorganized team's bottlenecks. 
 One thing I've noted is that they use a Windows share for file storage when their volume is well behind what I feel that's meant to handle. They have a root directory with 115k (at present) folders that all have six or seven files a piece. The files are necessary for the cases they're working, and the 115k items in their inventory account for 3 months worth of work. The file share will lag for up to a minute before loading on occasion.
 I don't have experience in this area, but I'm certain there has to be a better solution than this.
 What would you recommend?

 What safeties did you implement to prevent it? the only I can think now is using filters to exclude those non-compliant devices to be able to login - but that is pretty much manual process for every single device.

They definitely hit our price and feature requirements but I’m worried they’re too complex for MSPs where the average tenure is only a few years.
 Anyone care to share their experience working at an MSP that uses Juniper?

 ​
 We have about 30 Macs assigned to employees, with a simple IKEv2 server hosted at our company (hwdsl2/ipsec-vpn-server), we tried setting an "Always-on VPN" configuration profile to be deployed to our Macs through JAMF, but installing the config (even locally) just pops a generic error message The ‘VPN Service’ payload could not be installed. The VPN service could not be created.
 ​
 IPsec functions correctly, but employees have to manually enable it in settings... Plus, they should not have access to disable it in the first place.... so, has anyone had success with always-on VPNs? if not, how could we remotely access services on our managed devices?

 Manually speaking, The driver consists of 4 files that are inside a .cab file, once extracted from the cabinet, the installation involves running cmd as an admin and using pnputil on one of the files to install.
 ​
 How would i go about deploying this to the company portal through intune?
 I tried extracting the .cab on my machine and making a .intunewin file from the directory with the install command utilizing the pnputil command, but it doesnt seem to do anything, the installation fails immediately.
 i also tried making the .intunewin from the .cab itself, also without success
 ​
 any ideas how i should go about this issue?
 a powershell script seems to be the answer, but im not much of a powershell scripter :\
 ​
 ** The whole point of this is that non-admin users could install those drivers without needing to open cmd as admin

One thing I’ve realized with myself is that I’m always too modest about my achievements and efforts. I downplay anything that I’ve done that goes above and beyond and brush off any praise I receive as “just doing my job”. I try too hard to not be the big showboating guy gloating about how many goals I’m kicking and don’t want anything to think that I’m bragging about something. 
 I feel like there’s a difference between being proud of a big achievement and making a huge deal out of something that was really minor. Looking around though I see people that are shameless about claiming credit for something that they both had very little to do with and also really isn’t that important in the grand scheme of things so they get ahead. Is modesty seen as a weakness in career endeavors?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Our org is 100% Cloud - all in on O365. We use SharePoint for file management and many of our staff use the onedrive app to sync folders to their pc's. Twice this year (so far), users have deleted massive folders/files (10-50k files) because they wanted to get rid of the sync'd folder on their pc - when they should have simply stopped the sync in the onedrive app.
 As you can imagine, doing massive restores from the recycle bin is extremely time consuming and it's tricky restoring from our cloud backup provider as it's usually not the entire site that is deleted.
 I was hoping MS had a policy we could set to stop bulk deletions (max deletions at a time = 20 or something along those lines), but from what i read and what MS support tells me, the only way to stop these deletion is to remove 'delete' permissions from all of our permissions, except for a select few staff. This also appears to disable renames as well.
 Is that truly the only way to stop this from occurring? Are there any O365 SharePoint settings to stop deletions in general? 
 Thanks for your input!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I started a new job and in a process of modernizing my network. The current network is a huge layer2 domain. The customers are in R&D and use a lot of multicast and broadcast. I am planning to turn this network into layer3 since 90% of our traffic is east-west. I am thinking to implement the spine-leaf topology. And utilize vrf-lite for each customer. My network is spread between five different buildings. The farthest building is probably 3000ft away from the main one. Also, the fiber between buildings is either OM1 except for the farthest one.
 It seems like I am going to be using Cisco C9300 and C9500 (or maybe 1u Nexus switch)
  
Can I use C9300 as leaf switches?
 Can I use C9500 for my spines?
  
I am thinking to deploy a couple of leaf switches to each build. I am not sure if this is a good idea or not. My understanding of the spine-leaf network, the vrf-lite exists only at the leaf level. If I have a tenant that happened to be located at two different buildings, the tenant's VLANs will be extended via vxlan / l2vpn. Am I right about this? Does the VLAN in bldg A need to match the VLAN ID in bldg B for the same tenant?
 Also, I am still wrapping my head how the routing between tenants. Since each tenant will be placed in a vrf-lite, then I would have to use route-leaking. Do I need to create an ACL on the leaf switches if the traffic between tenants must be restricted based on their applications (e.g. ssh, ftp, etc.) only?
 For my infrastructure, servers (AD, NTP, DNS, DHCP, ISE etc), Docker containers, end-users, and oob (ipmi and network management), should I put these on their own vrf-lite or should I put them on the master/default table? What is the best practice for infrastructure?
 ​

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks,
 I'm just curious on what other network engineers thoughts are on ciscos SD wan.
 Specifically, if you've worked with it, have you implemented it, or taken over?
 What components of it do you use?
 What do you like about it?
 In what situation would it be the best bet to deploy and why?
 How much does your org spent on it? What caused them to pay for it?
 The way I see it, the SD WAN full deployment is a super expensive system that completely is maintained by licensing, even though the equipment can technically perform the job already.
 Thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do networking for a client who is trying to set up a new VOIP service. The VOIP provider said they'll require a public IP handoff. The client has an available public IP in their static block. I configured the client firewall to use one of those static IPs and Im trying to think of the best way to set up this handoff. Current set up below:
 Coax > Modem > Ethernet > Router > Ethernet > Firewall. 
 The connection from the ISP router to the firewall is connected to one of the ISP router's switch ports. My opinion is its probably best to plug the VOIP provider's device needing a public IP directly into one of the other ISP router's switch port. It doesn't seem practical to try to put the VOIP device behind the firewall because that would need some SNAT config and it needs to be public facing. 
 What do you think? Still green at this so any/all input is appreciated. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[10 years ago i ran our server team, and retired our last 2003 server. it had lived a long life because it ran our ticketing system, and even after it was replaced, there were links back to it at the database level for some fixed asset information that the new system did not directly support, so the app devs wrote a little tool to get data from there for "this last year we need that before we setup our new web replacement". during my time with it (7 years) it went from physical to virtual as well. it had a long life.
 i moved on to back end app support, new people took over servers, devs finished their replacement in 2 years instead of less than 3 months and the server can be turned off right? sure. 
 then there were some VM host issues, some data storage problems, VMware helped the new server team recover everything, and the server re-appears. as i am recovering some of the systems i support, i notice the name and let them know, they delete it again. 
 forward 2 years, some update fails, working with VMware again to fix things, pops back into existence. I notice it... again. 
 more issues.... reappears...
 again..
 today is the 7th time in 10 years i have seen this fucking server that wont die. 
 I think its taunting me. oh, and my co-workers are incompetent.

 Every single renewal has been plagued by licensing issues, and Adobe employees know fuck all about their own software. If I'm instructed to log out and back into an Adobe ID as a resolution one more time, I swear to fuck something is getting burnt down. Issues are inconsistent; some users can use the entire suite, others none of it, a few can use everything besides Acrobat. Even worse, my licensing provider will tell me something is included (such as Adobe Sign) and Adobe tells me that it isn't.
 So that leaves me, stuck in the middle, screaming like an absolute Karen, "We paid for licensing, fucking fix it!" I feel as if I'm screaming into the void, with no solution in sight, all the while staff can't perform their duties from lack of access.
 Has anyone experienced similar issues with this shit-show of a company or has any suggestions? Neither Adobe or my licensing provider has been able to provide a fix in over a month, and I'm at wits end.
 Edit: So fun fact, Adobe Sign doesn't come with Creative Cloud K-12 Shared Device licensing, so if an Adobe employee tells you otherwise, you call them a damn dirty liar. It took A MONTH for Adobe to figure that out. Guess we can't even expect them to do sales correctly either.

 Is there some sort of tool I can get that’ll allow me to plug it into a LC port and confirm signal without having to blind myself? Or am I overthinking the dangers of staring into light??
 Also on the copper side, I’m trying to see if there’s a tool I can plug into a RJ45 port to see if its unpatched, which switch it’s patched to, and if there’s a cable failure somewhere down the line.

 Full disclaimer: I am not an IT-professional but rather a user seeking advice since the field im in is quite sparse with IT professionals in the "middle-ground" and my go-to IT guy rarely deals with the bandwith/use-cases I work in.
 I do own a small post-production studio (1-3 users) which is currently based on 10 Gigabit Ethernet (speaking Cisco SG-X series) connections with Intel/ATTO NICs. I have 3-4 Workstations with 2-3 file-servers and an LTO-Library working in parallel all using 10Gbase. 
 I want/need to upgrade this to fiber to reduce energy-costs and to future-proof the setup and be able reach 25GB speeds (only with some flash/NVME applications/transfers).
 Due to the recent energy costs in europe and the implementation of more network applications (Adder Infinity KVM and Dante audio-networking in my case) I was thinking thinking If I could consolidate the switches and instead run everything in the studio with one (core)switch?
 If that is a terrible idea - let me know. 
 I thought about investing into an FS.Com Switch* like the S5860-48SC, but of course I already read here that people are still sceptic about the software/interface. 
 *(If I recall correctly most switches nowadays are white-labels and every vendor applies their firmware/implementation?)
 Any advice on how to future proof upgrade from 10G is appreciated.
 Since I already run my video on fiber I can easily upgrade the whole facility to fiber step by step since I am due to rewiring anyways. 
 If my post fails to live up to the rules of this subreddit just let me know before deleting.
 Thanks in advance!

I was recently having connectivity issues between DCNM and the switches and to troubleshoot TAC support had me remove one of the leaf switches from DCNM, which then warned me about and removed it's VPC partner as well.
 After we resolved the connectivity issue, we attempted to add back in both leaf switches (preserving config) and it's throwing this error.
 "Cannot add a Brownfiled switch [serial number] to the fabric unless all existing switches are pending Brownfiled migration."
 I read this as I need to remove the other 4 switches and try adding them back all in at once as brownfield preserving config.
 Has anyone had to do this or run into this error before? Will the config actually be preserved and not cause any issues? Will I lose all my logged fabric changes since greenfield config or will it pick back up where I left off? Thanks.

When someone goes wrong, I'm the person they ask to fix it, I'm the one giving updates, and I'm the one suggesting and implementing changes when it's over.
 VIPs made a last minute request to install a VPN onto their personal devices ASAP. I questioned this and was told it's fine, but it isn't sitting well with me. I'm thinking about bringing it up a level because if a user did this I'd be pissed.
 I suggested consumer VPNs and reminded my manager that we know nothing about these devices, have not given any instructions on the use of the VPN, and this will expose our secure network which in all other circumstances we are very protective of. 
 Usually this manager can see reason, I'm not really getting this. It's like I'm talking to an end user. One of the VIPs doesn't even work in our company, it's a friend.
 I'm just doing it, but we go through so much effort to keep our network secure, jumping through hoops and implementing rigorous compliance standards, rolling out lengthily policies and reworking our internal processes to avoid creating gaps like this, only for what... some VIPs want to go on vacation and can't pay $10 for a month of Mozilla VPN.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After searching here and other subs I didn't really stumble across a similar enough application. We're a small local college looking to provide wifi access to students in some of our parking lots for after hours or pandemic restrictions. We would hang these on the outside second floor of buildings that border the selected parking lots. Our network is all Meraki (switches and inside AP) and can support the outdoor AP with either copper or fiber. Parking lots average about 200' x 200' and we can hang up to 3 or 4 AP's on most of the buildings facing the lots. So what is suggested for such an application?

Go to website foo and download foo.app.gz [link is broken] "Oh, yeah, it's a git download." [git link doesn't work] "Try this other link."
 Unzip foo.app.gz, go into the "install" directory, and run "setup.sh" [there is no "install directory" nor is there a "setup.sh"]
 "Oh yeah, run 'configure' then 'make all'." "There is no makefile." "You have to download that separately on another website, I forget where." "Okay, that's pretty vital." "Ask Dan."
 "Did Jim tell you to run configure? No no, run 'setup.sh' and ... there is no setup? When did they remove that?" "Who is 'they', here?" "Let me see what's going on, share your screen.... oh, I have never seen THAT before. Did you run brew bar-app-libs?" "This is a Linux box, not a Mac." "Okay, well, there is a Homebrew for linux, so get that..."
 "I know that Jenkins said every build has failed, but ignore that, and download this weird obscure package manager..."
  
And so on. I remember one developer was so mad his docker build didn't work, he said, "I thought you said you knew Linux?" and I wanted to punch him. He couldn't get it to work, either, and blamed my environment. And after I looked at his dockerfile, there was no way it would have worked; even the syntax was wrong.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All! 
 How do you keep your AD user employee details up do date? 
 All the employee metadata in the user account like Job Title, Department, Company, Manager name, phone numbers, address etc. might be superfluous in a basic org but become more useful when AD SSO is integrated with other enterprise systems such as Helpdesk that can leverage this info for approvals or hardware provisioning, etc. 
 So how do you do keep track of the constant changes to job titles, employee relocations, etc. Is IT normally burdened with this? We are considering offloading this task to HR as this seems more within their realm of responsibility, but we are unsure what the best way to go about it is. Do you provide direct AD access to those non-IT users? Do you use third party software? Also, what permissions are used? 
 -Thanks!

 I have a few Cisco switches on my network and want to add another one but I don't do it often so I want to make sure I don't mess it up since it's been a while. Some kind of an initial setup checklist such as this one would be helpful but it doesn't mention anything about VTP so I'm wondering if there is anything else I'm missing? The "new" switch was on another network before and I already wiped it (write erase) and deleted the VLAN database (delete flash:vlan.dat). Is there anything else to be done before configuring and then connecting to my network?

 It honestly astounded me that they lasted this long without burning to the ground. But the longer I've been here, the more I've come to realize that it's because they went with such a simple technology stack that they could get away with it. Here's a few things they did:

 is there any level of micro segmentation in place?
 How is it being done now or in the past?
 Where are you moving to?
 What are your experiences with it?
  
Just a North-South firewall?
 Is it done VLAN based, terminated on a firewall? 
 Which things do you group together on a VLAN?
 Large security enclaves / zones, for example a VRF sandwiched firewall?
 Anyone using Cisco ACI, just 'network centric', or going more to a 'application centric'/ more segmented approach?
 Anyone using NSX (VLAN backed or overlay)?
 Or using host based firewalling?
  
How do you operate the segmented datacenter? What procedures are in place? What tools do you use?

As these are discontinued, I am looking to move to the CBS350 range to keep things relatively consistent.
 In Australia, these are all basically non-existent for at least 52+ weeks. However, I have found the exact same models (albeit an NA model vs AU model) on US sites, in stock and available to ship.
 Apart from obvious conundrums around support should something go wrong or become faulty, is there any reason a USA version of a Cisco product would not work in Australia? All the switches I'm interested in have world PSU's, so that shouldn't be an issue.

I wonder is there a chance to create a PS String Skript, which will check automaticly all users - lets say every week - check the mailboxes , and when the mailbox is at 80% of the size it will extend the mailboxsize 20% 
 maybe there is already a solution for this, but i cant find it.

 No current documentation is a available, people don't necessarily know where all of the network equipment is, there might be undocumented/rogue gear, and there might be orphaned VPN links to third parties that people have forgotten about. There is no current network engineer to ask, the last one died/retired/wandered off.
 Once I identify all active, reachable networks then I can sort and document them, create a list of points of contact and so on. Then for mystery networks start to dig, probe and eliminate.

 I have an question.
 We are starting a new application from a 3th party Supplier and need some basic information from you guys.
 Since all those new machines will be pushed with WDS+ workbench and joint in our AutoPilot section. There still some things WDS+ autopilot cannot do.
 And therefore my opinion is to use GPO's.
 We have 2 Domain controllers (second one is for backup) 1 Wsus server 1 file server (locally) + veaam backup enabled ** On the Fileserver WDS+workbench
 So that specific application needs to have an folder (user based, not Computer based) 
 So we created a folder with the content of the requested software in it. It is shared now. And now it needs to take that folder and copy it to the user profile of the machine.
 How to setup this 
 Is this possible? I think it is, but now knowing for sure. The 3th party group provided us the installation document. But the part for copy folder to user via wds+workbench is not in there, for them it is copy paste.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to work out how we can have multiple tenants that are accessible by individual tenant administrator accounts. The documentation and web interface don't specify how a user logging in can specify the tenant they want to administer. I have Active Directory SSO working, so our tenant administrators get logged in automatically to the first tenant I created. However, if I create additional tenants and want certain users to have access to these in addition to our primary tenant, how do I grant access and have a way for the user to choose the tenant they login to? I see no way to grant permissions to the tenants to say which accounts have access, and if I try and use the same username on different tenants, it fails and says the user already exists.
 I think I may be fundamentally missing some crucial information on how this works.

 Hi,
 We have some places whereby we are alloted a single private IP inside of that company and we manage the networking infrastructure (IPS, switches, APs, etc.) under a double NAT situation, where our first gateway router is behind a NAT.
 Without an open port to the public facing internet, is there a way to still use TR-069 for our gateway device?
 -----------------------------------
 Essentially, this is what I want:
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-069#Connection_request_over_NAT
 I've been researching how to use STUN for a few days now with no breakthrough, from my research it seems possible, and that I need to utiltise the same UDP port when traffic is coming back to the CPE equipment to do so. I'm open to exploring other open source ACS servers as well that has an easier implementation for NAT traversal via STUN or XMPP.
 Thank you.

 I am trying to use a PowerShell script for enabling and enforcing MFA for users in O365. The issue I'm having isn't with the script itself, it is when I try to automatically run the PowerShell. I get the authentication popup looking for credentials. I've found some articles that'll let you put your username and password into the script so you don't need to authenticate before running the script. The password is in plain text which I'm not good with. Is there a way to connect to O365 and run a PowerShell script without having to manually run it and authenticate? Also, my understanding on Microsoft Graph is limited at the moment, but I suspect there maybe a way to use Graph for this?

If I close the Microsoft login prompt it works for a while then disconnects and asks the Microsoft login again...
 The Exchange autodiscover is correct and only pointing to itself but if I use Outlook's Automatic configuration tester it immediately asks me for a Microsoft login, then if I close that it correctly asks for the domain credentials and once I provide that it gets the correct on-premises autodiscover information.
 The only detail I can think of is that we have a 365 tenant with some of the same email accounts as on-premises but it's only for Microsoft Teams, Exchange online is not configured anywhere at all, it's not even licenced.
 I've tried adding the autodiscover xml to the Outlook registry but it makes no difference, it's like it always phones home to Outlook before trying the actual email server domain.
 Has anyone had this issue before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy Friday Sysadmins! Do you have any plans this weekend? If not, I might have something you can sink your teeth into... Number Matching in MS Authenticator. 
 It's a feature which essentially rather than prompt a user for a "yes/no" "approve/deny" response on their phone, asks a user to enter a number into a prompt box. This effectively blocks an attacker from flooding their phone with MFA requests, fatiguing them into accepting, thinking it's something they've done wrong; because the user will never see the number and the attacker will instantly know that attack won't work.
 This feature went GA last week but some of you may have had it in preview for the last couple of months, it's pretty solid and I thoroughly recommend it. From a users perspective, it's no more effort than an old school SMS code, and a tiny bit more than hitting "approve"
 The only thing I dislike about it from a users perspective, is that I can no longer simply hit "approve" from my Apple watch.. so be mindful of that with your execs and managers, I guess..?
 My video talking about it, demoing it and showing you where the settings are in Azure AD can be found here:
 https://youtu.be/cjsViEclw1I
 Apologies for the croaky voice, I'm unwell but wanted to get my weekly video out there and keep up with helping the small community of followers I've been working with for the past couple of months.
 If anyone wants any help with this, hit me up!

I guess that I need a layer "between" Ceph and the OS/kernel? How can I basically do it, as each Ceph node has a different IP and I really don't want to add yet another layer of HaProxy or KeepAlived+Floating IP.
 What happens if two VMs want to write into the same file at the same time? Does Ceph have any kind of locking mechanism that prevents the file to be "double-write"?
  
Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok so I'm struggling to search for the right terms so I've decided to try and ask.
 If you have a fibre run, and you connect two switches with 1Gbps transceivers, you get 1Gbps link. Yay.
 I'm trying to determine if "old" fibre is perfectly fine if it still works. You either get a 1Gbps connection or you don't - or - signal degradation and packet loss could mean a functional connection with a seriously low maximum capability even though the link is established at 1Gbps.
 What happens over time? 5 years, 10 years, 15 years? Does the capability of the medium degrade and lose performance? Do you get "indicated" 1Gbps right up until the point where you get no link? Do you get indicated 1Gbps but no where near the 1Gbps throughput and packet loss? 
 It's been quite hard to search for the answer, and I think I'm just using the wrong search terms, or this isn't widely discussed.

 Thank you

Our production has been adding some IoT devices connected directly to prod machines for some years. These devices needs outgoing internet traffic with some Azure/DNS/NTP servers. The way I handled it is I whitelisted the needed IP on the firewall.
 But as time goes, it gets complicated to manage these firewall WAN IP whitelisting, and I'm wondering if it is worth it. 
 In résumé, is it overkill to use Wan ip whitelisting for security purpose if iot device is initiating the internet traffic?

 Sample 1 which is a standard .html file is as expected - sample1.html
 Sample 2 which is the malicious JS obfuscated page which slipped through a filter contains .htm and then .pdf so the file properties displays this as .htm - malware mth.pdf
 This should have been caught by our filter but the double extension has caused it to not be picked up. I was trying to replicate this but I was having mixed results. I first tried copying the file name as its written with mth.pdf and it changed to a PDF. I then tried playing with the RTLO but this is pretty much patched by most browsers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 it has been a long time since I last used group policies to administer servers or other computers. Right now we have a terminal server which everyone logs into and uses. I want to prevent certain users from turning off the server by applying the specific group policy rule. From my memory, I think I did the right steps but just now I tested it and it didnt work. I did the following steps:
  
Move Terminal Server to OU 'Servers'
 Link GPO to 'Servers' with User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Start Menu and Taskbar > Remove and Prevent Access to the shutdown command activated. 
 Link another GPO to 'Servers' with Computer Configuration\ Administrative Templates\ System\ Group Policy\Configure user Group Policy loopback processing mode activated.
 Set security group for both only allowing the Standard-User Group to apply the policy.
 gpupdate on terminal server
  
What I expect to happen is the machine reading the loopback policy on startup, however I'm not sure if I just prevented that using a security-group. Do I need to include the machine itself inside the security group? How is it different than using "authenticated users". 
 After reading the loopback policy, the Server tries to read the user config policy but ignores it, because it is not a user. Now when a user logs into the machine, although not being inside the OU, the user reads the user configuration from the policy because loopback is applied and applies the policy, when the user is a member of the security group. 
 I'm certain I made a mistake somewhere because otherwise it would work. 
 ​
 Thanks for any help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have SQL 2019 STD RDS that is not domain joined and it's only accessible inside VPC (no public IP). I have an internal AD domain and several web servers joined to that internal AD inside VPC. MDTC is configured to with no auth on those EC2 instance and also on RDS. When I try distributed transaction initiated from the web app (on the EC2 instance) I get following error:
 "The MSDTC transaction manager was unable to pull the transaction from the source transaction manager due to communication problems. Possible causes are: a firewall is present and it doesn't have an exception for the MSDTC process, the two machines cannot find each other by their NetBIOS names, or the support for network transactions is not enabled for one of the two transaction managers. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8004D02B)" 
 DNS resolution should be working on that RDS, I can't check since xp_cmd_shell can't be enabled to try it out so RDS should resolve EC2 instances, DNS servers are set on VPC DHCP settings. Security rules are currently to allow everything while I am troubleshooting. I did everything like I usually do without RDS
 RDS option group settings
 ENABLE_SNA_LU true ALLOW_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS true ALLOW_INBOUND_CONNECTIONS true ENABLE_XA true TRANSACTION_LOG_SIZE 4 AUTHENTICATION NONE 
 The only question left here is, do I need active directory joined RDS for this to work (and ofc all servers joined to that same AD)? From all the docs and videos available this should work, but didn't find info anywhere is being part of AD hard prereq or not.

 We are using Microsoft 365 E5 our data is still on the on-premise fileserver, we use Exchange Online for email.
 I've been asked to come up with a solution for the following "problem". 
 The company wants to do some compliance checks on outgoing email, but only on some pre-defined checks;
 - More than 10 external recipients in to, cc or bcc
 - More than 50 internal recipients in to, cc or bcc
 - Attachments with information such as addresses or financial data to external recipients. 
 With the 'checks' above, there need to be some actions configured;
 - Block message (quarantaine) with message "Are you sure you want to sent this message" if 'yes' then send.
 - Block message (quarantaine) with message "Message blocked due to high amount of external recipients".
 - Block message (sent to manager for approval)
 - Block message with message "Contact IT for additional support" 
 I've been digging around and could not come up with a solution for this.
 Only things i could find where;
 - Limit the total recicpients per message
 - Limit the total recipients you can mail to per hour/day
 - Sent all external mail for approval to a manager 
 Does anyone knows a possible solution for this within the Microsoft e5 suite? 
 Thanks!

 I work for a company that services public safety radio systems, dispatch consoles, and the networks they are linked through. The company I work for requires us to be on an on-call rotation, 24x7 every 2 weeks (this figure depends on the number of competent techs). 
 We get paid a fixed standby amount for the week on-call of $100, with automatic time and a half when responding after hours. For municipalities on maintenance agreements, our time starts from port to port (company provided car). Phone walkthroughs are not paid. For customers not on a maintenance agreement, it’s a minimum 4 hours paid, but this is rare.
 The industry I’m in is small, and there isn’t much of a baseline for typical on-call standby compensation and minimum hour paid, so I’m turning to you guys to get an idea for an average in a somewhat related field.

 Are there any APs that you are aware of that allow for local management similar in performance/price point to the Aruba AP22/25 or Meraki Go lineup? I'm currently using the TPLink Eap670 (business line) and it's alright, but wanted to see if there were more performance/quality to be had elsewhere. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For work I'm deploying raspberry pi's connecting through gateway devices with SIM cards having static IPs. We've kept default settings mostly, no firewall but no ports being forwarded, except 22 for ssh which goes to a DMZ and then to the pi. 443 and 80 take you to the gateway login screen.
 First question: Does having no firewall matter if we're not forwarding any ports? Surely traffic just dies in a slightly different way?
 And much more importantly:
 Am I going to get DDoS'ed on port 22 any day now? /var/log/auth.log shows failed connection attempts every few minutes. The root account has a complex password with timeouts per attempt, so I'm not worried about access, but is it only a matter of time before some more ambitious bot discovers an open ssh port serving password attempts and has a thousand computers a common password dictionary on me? Or some Russian hackers take me down just so they can pretend I'm a drone bill the KGB?
 If yes, is the way to be safe to close down all ports and use openvpn to gain access? (This sucks because we'd like to access our gateway if the pi goes down). Or could I geo-lock access and save myself? 
 But at the end of the day, even if the gateway is set to deny all requests except ones from my own ip address, couldn't someone DDoS the firewall? Is a static IP safe for small businesses without cloudflare or whatever?

 While we have a few T-Berd 5800s and other chunks of expensive network testing equipment, none of this is something I can put on a cart and show to people that aren't familiar with this equipment already.
 I was thinking about a F5 Big IP, but these are really expensive and seemingly unobtainium at this point, I tried emailing them and a couple of their resellers and heard nothing back. I also have a hard time justifying $15,000 for a load balancer before the HTTP side just to demo.
 I think I could justify a pair of NASs, but there's a lot of moving parts and I have never seen files copied/downloaded at this speed. 
 Any ideas?

 Just wondering if anyone has had any luck finding an easy solution to converting raw syslog messages from their network devices into CEF format so they can be ingested into Microsoft Sentinel properly?
 This seems like something a small docker container with syslog-ng or rsyslog should be able to handle, syslog in, cef out.
 I'm having no luck finding anything though so thought I would ask here before I spend the time trying to build it myself.
 Anyone come up with a good solution?

 An accounting and tax software, whose engineering teams states they have national clients when asked how large some of the companies are that use their software, informed me that their software does not have any method for mass deployment.
 They do not offer any method of command line to install it. The exe (which i used USSF from that post a few days ago) does not have any hidden flags. It appears that it is simply an exe that when launched, extracts the files.
 So I am off to figure out where it puts its extracted files and go from there on how to install this.
 I don't normally rant, but when they told me they don't have any method of mass deployment and to use a tool like SCCM, I was astounded. We use other tools, but they don't support installers that offer no command line install options...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This was just a weird situation all around, and I just needed to rant about it for a bit. This happened about 2 weeks ago.
 In the middle of the IT department, there is a table with our primary printer. One day, randomly, there were cupcakes and a bag with a brand name on it (the bag also contained 2 handwritten cards directed to our director and CIO). I asked around, no one knew where they came from. My coworkers started eating the cupcakes, but I didn't because I had a bad feeling about them. You need a key fob to get into our building, we had never heard of the brand before, and no one saw the person who dropped them off.
 Fast forward a couple of hours. I'm in the restroom and so is the building's receptionist. "How did you guys like your cupcakes?" she asked. I looked at her, confused, and asked what she knew about them.
 "Well, a guy came in and said they were for the IT department. I couldn't get ahold of anyone, so I just sent him back." Awkwardly, I told her none of us saw him and none of us knew who he was, either.
 "Oh."
 Getting back to my desk, I tell my coworkers what I had learned. Some random vendor we've never dealt with before personally delivered cupcakes. Whatever, vendor wants you to buy their products. What upset me more is that our receptionist just let a random person into the building for really no reason. We're not government or anything like that, but why have key fobs for the doors if our receptionist is going to let just about anyone in?
 Apparently I was the only one freaked out by that - everyone else had a cupcake. Luckily, they were just regular cupcakes, but still. That did NOT sit well with me.
 Rant over.

 My company recently started a new project. The idea is that one entire building(500+ users) with different companies logs into one SSID. Every company will have his own vlan through a radius server. Printers should be available to all vlans. We used avahi(mDNS reflector) to make printers available in all vlan’s. But for obvious reasons we don’t want printers to broadcast itself. Since some printers shouldn’t be used by other companies.
 We tried:
 We tried blocking outgoing mDNS broadcast packages. But that didn’t help.
 We looked into avahi option’s. It doesn’t look like they cant regulate traffic like we want.
 Same for aruba switch, it supports mDNS reflection. But cant actually regulate traffic like i want?
 Question:
 Is there a different way to make this happen? Or is there an good way to regulate these mDNS packages?
 Thanks,
 Luc
 Edit:
 So in the building we got flex spots. So sometimes different companies will use different places in the building. Thats why its import most of the printers should still be available.

The issue is that the space on it is taken up by other things such as pre-installed telco equipment and cables. My question is has anyone mounted some 2x4's on the plywood to mount the cabinet to in order to clear said cable bundle? I also have another section where I can mount the cabinet to on concrete block at a height that is reachable. The issue is that it will be very tight in that section and also very close to a power panel. If it doesn't work out, I've managed to source some caster wheels for said cabinet to keep on floor level, but it would be a lot cleaner looking on the wall and out of the way. Any advice or suggestions are appreciated. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm running iBGP between 2 servers where 1 of the servers is announcing all subnets to upstream (for IPv6).
 They are both running Debian and BIRD2. Server A has 2 neighbors 1 - Upstream provider 2 - server B.
 Server A and B are link using GREv6. 
 Server B only has 1 neighbor with server A and has dummy NIC with IP address I want to announce. 
 The BGP session establish just fine. The subnet server B trying to announce does show up on bgp.tools/ However, I can't ping address on server B from outside. When I ping from server A, it gives TTL expired. When I run traceroute on server A, it's looping on A until it expires. Any idea on what I could do to actually pass the packet to server B via GRE?
 This configuration is basically the same on server A and B just swap different IP for local and remote.
 protocol bgp server{
 local GREv6IP as OURASN;
 neighbor GREv6RemoteIP as OURASN;
 ipv6 {
 import all;
 export all;
 };
 }
 ​
 Any idea would be appreciated.

 I think this would be a helpful tool, and if it was under $500 I would just buy one. However, I wanted to hear from others before dropping multiple thousands of dollars on such a tool. 
 Does anyone here own an Ekahau or similar device? Do you use it often? Has it been worth the cost in your opinion?

 Need some advice and insight. How have you all managed routing in a mixed vendor environment? My question is specifically with Juniper vs Cisco: route preference vs administrative distance?
 Still working on the details, but as of now we have branch office router seeing two default routes one in IGP OSPF and another in BGP. One of the default routes is for internet access and the other from corporate (Incase the internet default goes down).
 The branch router runs IOS-XE, Corp device is Juniper, and the internet default comes from a Palo-Alto FW.
 Our Juniper rep has said to change Cisco’s AD values to match theirs and guess what our Cisco rep said the same thing for Juniper! I get the feeling they are just looking to gain an advantage over the other and not really engineering anything. So I have come here looking for suggestions and insight.
 Edit:spelling and details

I'm sick of having sales tell me one thing and then when it comes to implementation I get a totally different story. Working in the financial services sector it's all vendors do anymore, they lie and they lie and they lie. I want to build systems and solutions not have legal battles with a bunch of liars. I'm to the point that I'm going to start recording sales calls because I don't know what else to do. People are going to say, "make sure it's in the contract", and I do to the best of my ability when its a vendor I picked, but I'm also not a lawyer, I'm a sysadmin. Not to mention jumping ship from vendor to vendor can be more disruptive than just dealing with it or figuring out a manual solution for things. This job isn't fun anymore and frankly it sucks. OK, I've said what I wanted to say, thanks for listening. If you want to call out any liars in the comments feel free.

A few things I’m thinking about - interference from welding machines, microscopic pieces of steel in the air causing signal issues, giant pieces of steel everywhere reflecting Wi-Fi signal, steel dusting settling on the APs making a faraday cage kind of thing.
 Anyone have advice for this kind of environment? Am I being overly cautious? Anything else to consider?

 Packets sent = 117, Received = 60, Lost = 57 (48% loss). This loss percentage varies between 45-80%.
 Approx round trip time in ms = 
 average = 4-14ms, max = 767ms 
 These Cat6s are running from devices in field to a control station. There is some electric interference present around them (120V) but these are 600V rated Cat6 cables. Since they are 600V rated, they are very bulky. Customer suggested us that the weight of the cables could be causing the issue at the switch. I find that difficult to believe since only 4 out of 60 Cat6s are acting up.
 I am thinking as a first step of troubleshooting to re-terminate both ends for the cables. Sounds like an easy thing to do but not so easy when a lot of other parties are involved.
 What could be the most likely cause for this? Any suggestions?
 Appreciate the help!

 Hoping someone can clear this up for me. I've got a vulnerability warning in the Defender portal showing that 27 of my devices have OpenSSL installed and need to be updated. The part that's confusing me here is that I can find no trace of OpenSSL installed on these systems. The only place that it shows as installed is in the Defender portal. There's no trace of it in the Windows Registry, nothing in the system path, no services running, nothing in the installed apps list, etc. But Defender is going as far as pulling in different version numbers from somewhere. 
 Any ideas on what's happening here? This is only showing on about half of my devices. All have been deployed through Intune. We don't do any sort of custom certificate management and I've sure never set up OpenSSL to be deployed, so I'm not sure where it's coming from as it isn't very consistent. Some of these devices were deployed months ago, one was freshly ran through autopilot earlier this week. 
 Much thanks to anyone who can point me in the right direction here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to remotely add a computer to domain using powershell:
 Add-Computer -ComputerName $computer -LocalCredential $credential -DomainName $DOMAIN -Credential $ad_credential -Restart 
 This is giving me an error:
  
Add-Computer : Cannot establish the WMI connection to the computer 'comuter' with the following error message: The RPC server is unavailable. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x800706BA).
  
When I stop the firewall on the remote computer and run the add-computer command again, it works, so it seems windows firewall is blocking something.
 Does anyone know what specifically I need to enable/allow on the firewall to allow this remote management?
 The reason I ask is that I am automating the entire VM build process, so manually RDPing to the machine after it is created to stop firewall, then re-running the join domain command is not the solution I am looking for. I need to know what on the firewall I need to open so that I can automate it.

The threat was sent via this program and is delivered through to the teachers regular office email.
 I've asked the school to provide IP address of his logins during the day but they only provided/obtained the schools external IP address. They did not provide any internal IP address, obviously the internal IP address with login data is the most valuable for us.
 Can anyone think of a why where we can be sure this data is retained while we work with a lawyer? I've made the request with the school now on two different occasions. Can anyone think of other information that I might not be thinking about?

 I am troubleshooting an issue in which i getting reported latency to an application on an external site. I have a user saying that when he is on prem, he is getting latency of 10-25 seconds accessing the site but when he is on our VPN connection to our prem network, its 2-3 seconds. Is there any logical reason that this site is taking longer to access on site than VPN? Ive always know the opposite to be true with VPN users having issues with latency. I am at a impasse since due to security restrictions, most of the routers upstream dont respond to icmp so tracing the hops is out of the question. 
 Appreciate any ideas and sorry if this sounds jumbled, i am pre-caffeine brain.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I had a quick question regarding my new jobs network setup. Bare with me, as this is the first time I have ever worked with Cisco Devices, so my knowledge of them is fairly slim.
 Here is the situation broken down very simply:
 - We have 2 ISP Connections (Primary and Backup)
 - We have 1 CORE Cisco Switch (Cisco 6807XL)
 - We have 2 CheckPoint Firewalls setup in "High Availability Mode"
 Now here is where I THINK I understand the setup, but in reality I need clarification or for someone to tell me that I have it worked out in my head correctly lol.
 I have roughed up a very rudimentary drawing of how it is setup -- Here is the link: https://ibb.co/zhBwnK1
 All I am curious about is:
 1.) For the ISP Connections... They are going into Ports that are tagged as VLAN 17 & 18 .... And the Firewalls are connected to more ports that are also tagged as VLAN 17 & 18 ----- Does this mean that the Internet is "piping into that first port" and then any other ports that are tagged as 17 / 18 ... are automatically getting blanketed with that ISP connection (Just like how an unmanaged switch works)? And Thus.... in the Eyes of the Firewalls, the Firewall's WAN Port just thinks that you took the Ethernet cable from the back of each Modem... and plugged it straight into the Firewall?
 In all my years of experience with networking, I have only ever seen the chain look like this:
 ISP Modem >>> Firewall >>> Core Switch >>> Smaller Switches >>> PC's / Printers / AP's / Etc
 So the fact that this job is setup backwards (in my eyes) as:
 ISP Modem(s) >>> Core Switch >>> Firewall >>> Smaller switches >>> PC's / Printers / AP's / Etc ---- And the fact that I am a Cisco novice lol... Its the perfect storm for confusion.
 I hope this makes sense, and if anyone has any thoughts - I would greatly appreciate them!
 Thanks,

 18.04 LTS will soon enter "Extended Security Maintenance (ESM)".
 What does this mean compared to the normal "Hardware and maintenance updates" phase?
 Security-wise and only considering the OS, is 18.04 then as secure as 22.04 LTS? Meaning they get the same security updates as long as they are supported?
 My understanding is that 22.04 LTS comes with newer versions of all packages compared to 18.04 LTS. Doesn't this mean that 22.04 LTS is better security-wise than 18.04 LTS?
 What I am basically aiming at is whether upgrading 18.04 LTS to 22.04 LTS is worth the risk compared to the benefits (benefits being mostly higher security due to fixed vulnerabilities?)

 I'm not a Linux specialist and I have a linux-server with apache 2.4.38 in my environment. Now the question is, how do I identify which version of Apache is vulnerable? I didn't find anything on apache.org about the library which should be included in this version.
 I read, that there should be a library with the name " Apache Commons Text versions 1.5 through 1.9. ", which is vulnerable. But how do I find this library on the system? Is this even possible?
 ​
 thank you for any support.
 ​
 edit: I found the library ( Commons Text – Download Apache Commons Text ). Can I just install it on the Linux machine? or should I update the whole apache? How can I identify that it isn't vulnerable anymore?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 We were recently discussing the Microsoft Authenticator app in a meeting. Someone mentioned they store all their passwords in it rather than in Chrome / Edge. One of us - fairly senior member of the team- became concerned about this and basically said:
 "Well the whole point of MFA is you have a known password, and then a thing, and that thing is either a hardware token, or the MFA app - However if the app now stores passwords, doesn't that defeat the purpose of MFA?"
 From my point of view, it would be way too much of a faux pas if Microsoft just hadn't thought of this, and with our phones being in Intune, they have to have a password, they likely have biometrics etc, so i cant see it being an issue?
 Also i just tried signing in with my work account to the password keeper part, and it wouldnt accept the details, as it needs to be a Microsoft account, not a Work or school account.
 Does anyone else have any views on this that would help me articulate clearly to my colleague why this wouldnt be a security issue? Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This may be a really dumb question, apologies if so. I have inherited a group policy that restricts which Edge browser extensions can be installed. There's a lot in the list, but the policy only stores "extension ID"s and I can't find a way to figure out what the extension is from the ID. Googling this just returns how to get the ID, not how to use the ID to figure out the name of the extension. 
 If anyone knows I would appreciate a point in the right direction!

Right now, we're in the middle of onboarding a new application that wants to go to s3.amazonaws.com. CISO refuses to whitelist that URL because we don't want to have access to every single s3 bucket out there. Here's where I'm stuck: As far as I can tell in firewall logs and pcaps, the app isn't even trying to reach a particular region or bucket: it's just trying to hit the broad s3.amazonaws.com domain. If that's true, then how do I restrict this application's access? 
 I know precious little about how AWS works on the back end, so feel free to ELI5. I feel like there's some kind of fundamental misunderstanding I have that would solve everything, if only I knew what that was.

 I am working with CIS custom Image for my EC2 - AMZ2 instance.
 I am facing a new finding in the Inspector result, which is:
 Ensure use of privileged commands is collected 
 The recommended action is to run the following command:
 # find -xdev \( -perm -4000 -o -perm -2000 \) -type f | awk '{print \"-a always,exit -F path=" $1 " -F perm=x - F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 \-k privileged" }' 
 And add the results to the:
 /etc/ audit/rules.d/audit.rules 
 ​
 But, when running this command; I got a syntax error.
 ​
 So, I tried to add the following lines (Containing my partitions) to the mentioned file, but this finding still appears in the inspector report.
 -a always,exit -F path=/dev/xvda -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged -a always,exit -F path=/dev/xvdb -F perm=x -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=4294967295 -k privileged

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello
 I manage a server for an important site which is regularly the target for DDoS attacks etc. The site is occasionally sending out newsletters to subscribers. That server is hosted on Hetzner. Hetzner has been contacting me with abuse requests (AbusePhishing: SPAM/PHISH Complaint) that people have sent them and is now threatening to shut down the server. I had a look at those forwarded emails and I discovered that the Message-ID hashes cannot be found in my /var/log/mail* logs (I have enough logs to cover the timestamps that those emails have allegedly been sent from my server). The emails content contains the newsletter content from the site but also appends various Pfizer spam links and images. All other legit emails that the site has sent can very easily be found via grepping their Message-IDs in /var/log/mail*.
 Question: Is there a possibility that a malicious actor has subscribed to the site's newsletter, copy/pasted the email that was sent to them, polluted it with spam links, and reported this as an abuse to their provider, in hope that it'll reach Hetzner which will in turn threaten with shutting down the server? Does this thing ("fake spam abuse claims") actually exist? Have you heard about it before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 ​
 Im curious about how a site-to-site IPsec VPN tunnel works where one end have a public IP and the other end have a private IP.
 ​
 For example, let say on site A: we have a firewall that is connected to a router. The WAN interface on the firewall is a private IP, 192.168.1.1/30 and is connected to a port on the router, and the routers WAN port pointing to the ISP, have a public IP.
 ​
 So,
  
How can we establish a VPN tunnel between the sites and how would the configuration look like? I know for example that on site A, the router needs to forward port 500 & 4500 for IPsec communication. But from site B, what would the peering IP be since private IPs are not routable on the internet?
 And how would the configuration would look like on site A when configuring a peering IP? I think that you need to NAT on site A but my brain just wont let me understand how this would exactly work out when I tried to lab it.
  
​
 Appreciate your help.
 ​
 EDIT: I want to understand how to establish a VPN tunnel between the firewalls, so from site A firewall that have a private IP to the firewall on site B that have a public IP, sorry for not clarifying it.

 However, if you work in Education or my case Higher Ed you know things are... different? 
 At the moment our staff and faculty have always used Exchange while students have always used Gmail. 
 Well, now we are going to move students over to Microsoft 365 along with exchange online.
 My question is, does your institute use different tenants? One for students and one for Staff? Or do you put them all under the same tenant and if so do you use different domains for each?
 I'm leaning toward having 2 tenants. 
 What have your experiences been?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi fellow Redditors
 Due to also some recent ransomware that had attacked also my company's competitor, some people, that in my and a colleague of mine opinion are trying to justify their pay, have had this "novel" idea to change the wallpaper of computers every week or so, with a message dedicated to educating ransomware/phishing techniques and avoiding them.
 There seems to be a good intention, for this, and I definitely agree, however, what i don't agree with, is the way this is intended to educate the end user. 
 You see, the very end user audience that this is intended for has no time to pay too much attention to the text that is on the wallpaper. They are on the clock the soon they enter the premises, and they have to be ready to start working asap. 
 As a company, we have our internal courses for training purposes, and this includes almost every subject that touches the company, and some of those courses are mandatory, even for IT staff like me.
 However, having this type of messaging via wallpaper, seems overboard to me, and having to file requests to go before CAB, any GPO changes go to CAB no matter what the purpose is, for this is ludicrous.
 Time is better spent to educate the users with proper courses, not via a small text on the wallpaper, with horrible colours.
 ​
 So, my fellow professional Redditors, how would you approach this if it comes into your lap? What better solution would you recommend, and what is your general opinion of delivering messages via desktop wallpapers every other week or more?

 My company went from around 150 employees to 600 in two years.
 User management is beginning to take its toll on our relatively small IT department.
 We currently have a Microsoft Form that HR submits with the User On- or Offboarding info. Name, e-mail, Department, Manager, Title, Accesses, Licenses etc. We then get this form sent to our helpdesk where we later create the user on-prem which later syncs to Azure.
 There is always something missing, wrong manager, new distribution group needed, additional access/licenses, wrong PC ordered, new start/end date, change of PIM etc,. It takes so much time from us.
 Is there a better way to handle these requests? Any third-party solutions?
 How do larger enterprises solve this? I can't fathom them having guys only working full-time with user management (on this level).
 How do YOU do it in your company?

 Using tools / formats that are readily available on most machines (like zip) is helpful but not a must.
 For compression, it seems zstd is pretty sweet. I've never used it tho. Opinions or alternatives are very welcome.
 For encryption, I usually use GPG, but I'm concerned about performance. I'm open to both symmetric and asymmetric solutions.

 Splitting the stacks and connecting the 4 switches together is an option, but now we have a spanning tree loop (that's blocked, but still)
 Is there a better way?
 Quick edit, obviously there ARE better ways, with equipment that would support VSS, vPC, MLAG, etc. But in this case, let's pretend we only have access to 3850s.

 The organization I work for is merging one AD domain into a larger domain. I've combed this sub and some forums so I'm going to answer the question I think I'm going to get fist: yes we have contracted with a company that has software that does this very thing.
 Here's the issue. For as good as this company used to be, it's gone downhill in recent years. The support (or lack of) we're getting is making us think they have no idea how the tool works. We're a small outfit so it's possible they've given us less experienced techs, but we're still talking about moving 800 endpoints and a lot of files. I'm getting nervous about using the tool to re-permission files when they don't seem to have a grasp on what the tool is doing. I want a backup plan.
 The sAMAccountName is the same in both source and target domain. File servers are located in and permissioned to the target domain.
 Here's my question: does anyone have a suggestion for a tool or script that can view the permissions for files in the source domain and add the matching target domain user?
 I'm more of a bash guy, but I can learn enough PowerShell to get this job done if necessary. I do have a full set of backups should the worst happen.
 Thank you!

 I am positive I am doing something someone else has done and my google-fu is failing me. I am not a VMware guy, but our on-prem data center is 100% VMware. Today I use packer to build and distribute our new monthly windows images to our azure regions. Word made it to the powers that be that my image is better documented (infra as code essentially) and more consistent than what our on-prem server team is doing. So naturally they decided that I should just "provide the image" to the infra team to use on the vcenters. Problem is I am way out of my element here. I have a repeatable process to get the azure images down as an VHD to the hybrid runbook worker. The problem I haven't figured out is how to get them into a format the VMware guys can use. 
 So with the long context out of the way, anyone got any good step by step guides or YouTube video they can recommend to get azure images into vSphere as a template? Or a tool that easily converts VHD files into a VMware vSphere friendly template format?

 I have a comware OS switch (C-Sw) that I'm looking to get started with VLANs but it's not going well.

This worked - hosts could ping each other across B-Sw and C-Sw and out to greater internet (if allowed). It's unfortunately router-on-stick- model with pfSense doing routing (and I want to change that next phase).
 Next phase config - I want to deploy some hypervisors to the hosts connected to C-Sw and want/need some VLAN support so I can correctly segment client from various mgmt networks. The usual.

 It looks like there aren’t a whole lot of differences in the Gen 3 other than the 12th Gen i5 but it’s like $1000 more. Is it REALLY worth the spend to go into a newer generation of processor? I’m open to extra spend if it’s justified, but I’m drawing a blank other than it’s slightly better performance. 
 These laptops will be for standard users who mainly just run office apps and PDFs so not power users or anything.

 They also won't let me use terms billing with vendors like Amazon, because you have to pay those invoices with a check, so I get to reconcile dozens of receipts separately every month.
 I've tried arguing against it, citing the PITA that ensues every time there's suspected or actual fraud on the card and I have to get a new one, or when we've gone over the company limit and my card is just dead for 2-3 days. But oh no, "this is what management prefers."

I've been fiddling with a bunch of products and would love to hear any real world feedback on what folks are switching to for VPN. I have a small office network but most stuff in AWS. 
 So far, I've been recommended:
 - Twingate: most often recommended in my circle and I use it for my homelab. Super easy to use and nice integrations. Curious to learn from anyone who's ran this in production at their company.
 - Cloudflare: eng team uses their CDN so easy to tack-on for their VPN product. Finding it pretty gnarly to set up and maintain and generally seems like a half-baked product. Anyone using this?
 - Zscaler: friends who work at bigcos use this, but honestly seems a little overkill. Sales process to even get a trial to POC was a pain, but seems very full featured. 
 - Tailscale: lots of people use it for homelab, but haven't found anyone who uses it for their company. Generally doesn't seem serious for businesses (most of those same people pointed me to Twingate to compare). Any one using it for their company?
 Have looked at a bunch of others as well, but shortlisting the above. Looking for some real world feedback.

 Tickets go into black holes, and I have to call and speak to a supervisor to get something as basic as a status update.

 I’m currently a senior telephony engineer, my career began in 2015 (I self studied CCNA and whilst studying, took the leap and applied for junior network engineer job and landed one, I did not go university so I have no degree) I stayed at my first job for about 1 year and then moved onto another network role as the colleague I worked with was awful and I wasn’t learning much from him, just experiencing his anger issues at everyone and anyone each day. 
 Second job rolls around and it’s going great until they push me into telephony, aren’t paying me enough but are making me juggle both network and telephony and then one day decide I have to cut out networking and focus on telephony, I then get a call for another telephony job and I go for it as it’s paying more, I get it so I move on.. I stayed there for about 10 months and then I got a call for my current job and I’ve been here for nearly 3 years. 
 Now.. my current workplace are getting rid of all Cisco telephony and moving onto MS teams, no issue there but I’m not feeling any personal development for myself and I’m not sure if I should get my CCNA and go back into networking (also worried about a salary cut as i’m now a mum and I also support my mum financially as my dad left when I was very young) or do I delve into the cyber space as I always had an interest for it.
 My husband is suggesting I try programming as he’s in the field and he thinks, with my background I won’t have a problem landing a job if I can learn and understand it.

 Also if I plug my laptop directly into the cat cable on the device that can’t see the other devices I can see/connect to that device. A reboot of the device that is having issues fixes the problem. 
 I should also add that there is no firewall enabled and it’s super intermittent and it’s not always the same device when it happens but every time the only fix I’ve found is to reboot.

 i don't know if this question is allowed (Rule #6), but i don't get the necessary pieces together.
 I found the following article / documentation for Proxmox which mentioned the use of OVS for SDN deployments.
 Now to my question: How can i route traffic from a specific VXLAN (VM inside of a VXLAN) to the "outer world" such as physical servers or other networks? Or even intra VNI traffic? The best case scenario would be that a firewall could handle all these cases. 
 To be clear i don't expect a full-answer to this question. A hint would be sufficient which guides me to the pieces or knowledge i am currently missing.
 Thanks in advance of all people who are wiser and kinder then me ^^

 Some clients are physically connected to both (copper / fiber). Machines with 10G cards connect to the 172 network to connect to file servers, and use the 192 to get to the internet. 
 Would connecting these two networks to each other, via a fiber cable from the 192 switch to the 172 switch, cause a loop? Or should I pull the copper from each workstation first? I want to phase out the 172 network, and have the 192 network access 1G and 10G infrastructure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I work in a logistics depot for a large company that provides laptops/desktops to employees all over the country. Techs remote access these devices and configure them for the users before they are shipped out. 
 Part of my Job duties include making sure these assets are connected to our wifi network and available to remote into, usually between 200-300 at a time. Recently I've noticed that our AP's have been dropping assets more than usual and I would like to monitor the devices proactively vs waiting for a tech to inform me that one has lost connection and they are unable to remote into it. 
 I keep an excel sheet with all the assets listed by Serial number and location and I'm looking for some sort of solution to monitor this list and make sure all assets on the list are pingable and showing connected. I am a contractor and have ZERO access to the access points or wifi network so I obtain IPs by pinging the serial number. 
 This may not be the best place to ask this but I figured it's simple enough that people in this group would understand my question and probably know of a simple solution. 
 Also I have a very small amount of technical experience, mostly all self taught for this position and solving my own problems at home. I know some basics, but way less than most of you probably lol.

We currently have it disabled across the board via GPO but I am in the process of enabling the firewall internally. I'm just not sure if I want to enable it on servers. Seems like a disaster to have to whitelist every port that's being used.
 UPDATE: Thanks everyone. I obviously knew what the answer was going to be but wanted to bring this to management to prove that this is an issue. This network was inherited and the org definitely has a lot of "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality.

Due to some provider limitations, we're looking at using two firewalls for egress from a specific location and want to make sure that client/server conversations stick to a single firewall. Current plan is to use static routing with IP SLA health checks and set each egress at the same weight. What I can't figure out is what load balance mechanism for static routes is used on IOS XE on a Cat9400 or Cat4500. Is it just src/dst IP or is there more to it than that? Labbed in Eve-NG with IOSv and it appeared to be src/dst IP but I don't know how to confirm that hardware will function the same way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy! 
 We have multiple servers that ~70 staff use daily that I would like to migrate to drive.google.com given the age of the equipment and the recent string of hard drive failures ... but after asking everyone to pair down to the current data versus legacy we still have many department folders that are over the 400,000 items/object limit 
 Since a shared drive can contain a maximum of 400,000 items/objects ( including files, folders, and shortcuts) I'm not sure what to do ... also given the large quantity I'm concerned about how well the Google Drive for Desktop application will work (everyone uses macOS and some computers are 5 years old)
 Through discussion, staff have agreed they can split out the files they don't need constant access to e.g. an "active archive file server website" and could access via a different site/service or similar but I'm not sure what would be a good service to support split access and doesn't cost a fortune. Looked at Backblaze B2 but its not really built for that. Google cloud storage supports the idea of it but is expensive and still isn't really designed to be easily browsed like a filesystem. Certainly Dropbox or similar services could work well ... but we're duplicating systems and costs then which seems silly. Management suggested just start new on drive.google.com and keep running the legacy servers but that doesn't fix the issue of the old, failing equipment.
 In a perfect world there would be select folders that you would stream to Google Drive for Desktop and then others would only be available at drive.google.com but that doesn't seem possible like it once was in older versions? Thought about setting up a separate Google active-archive user that staff could login to but with 70 people and changing staff that seems cumbersome at best. 
 Any suggestions?
 Thanks!

 Backupify was driving me nuts,
 I just switched to AFS last night, they backed up my 100GB mailbox in 5:06 minutes, insane speed.
 They gave me option to choose datacenter which I could not find with other solutions, this made compliance easy for one of our domains has to be in Canada due to healthcare rules.
 The interface is clunky, but the speed and cost are amazing,
 I wanted to go back to spinbackup due to the search/discovery and security features for multi-domain environments (I find it cheaper then enhancing and building policies in multi-domains), but their prices seemed to have doubled in the pandemic and the multi-domain is complicated.
 AFS seems to hit the multi-domain part well, I got various licenses at multiple entities so getting a solution where everything is under one hood is nice. I have some domains with Gsuite+M365 and others that are just Gsuite and some just M365.
 Anyways the setup and configuration took me about 25 minutes, I set it all up myself and have all my sites / teams / mailboxes etc... all backed up now and I am saving a few hundred bucks a month which I will use now to setup some other compliance tools.
 I am still searching for a solution that has a faster and easier interface to run searches across multi-domains / platforms (Gsuite/M365), right now I use an expensive tool and its a pain in the bum for the queries, if anyone knows of a moderately priced solution like AFS I am interested. I have to run searches for PDF's and the content within PDF's regularly, which is why I sync things to google drive as they have ability to search PDF's.

Our ICT department just split in half NOC and SOC, and head of NOC is vacant. I have always been keen and worked very hard. The vacancy requirements, I full fill them all but I have to start to work 5 days a week from work and, later on, I can work remotely. My biggest concern is my lack of experience, not in a managerial position but in knowing all the systems that they work on. What are your suggestions shall I apply knowing I lack experience and then if I will be chosen I learn along the way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The firm I work for has a small residential site in a rural area in the UK (South/West Wales). From the looks of it there's no chance of anything other than 3mbit ADSL via the phone line or less than ideal 4G using an external antenna. There's no altnets in the area and leased lines are looking at £800/month which isn't really feasible.
 However, as this site will need to provide public and staff internet connectivity we will need decent bandwidth (say up to 80mbit download), so we're looking to use starlink to provide this.
 I was wondering if anyone here has used Starlink for this kind of fixed site job and had any information regarding reliability and ease of configuration? My main worry is being able to use my own router/firewall if the supplied unit doesn't have the features we need. Also does anyone know if the "domestic" tier has any acceptable use limits?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm using Windows Server 2019 as a host with a few Mellanox Connect-X 6 LX cards. I've created a vSwitch with SR-IOV enabled.
 I've used VMNetworkAdapterVlan -Trunk to pass a number of VLANs to the SR-IOV enabled vNIC in the VM.
 I'm using a nightly of VyOS and have an extremely simple single interface config for validation. I am able to use tcpdump and see tagged traffic coming in on the parent interface.
 But I am unable to get traffic out the NIC tagged. Is this a limitation of SR-IOV in Hyper-V? I have been down so many rabbit holes with VF security and MAC spoofing and filtering and nearly all information is targeting KVM not Hyper-V.
 Has anyone been able to get guest VLAN tagging through SR-IOV?

 Hopefully someone can help as I've run out of ideas.
 I have an old tenant and a new tenant. Both are using Microsoft Purview Encryption's 'Encrypt-only' option within the Outlook desktop client.
 If old tenant sends an email to newer tenant, the new tenant can read the email natively within the Outlook desktop app.
 If the new tenant sends an email to the older tenant, the old tenant has to go to Outlook on the web to access.
 Bits you might want to know.
  
Both using Exchange Online
 Both are using Microsoft Outlook for Microsoft 365 MSO (version 2208 on new tenant, version 2209 on old tenant).
 I've tried doing this manually via the Outlook client and via DLP, but same experience.
  
If someone has an answer or guidance, I'd really appreciate it.
 Thanks,
 Max

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear r/sysadmin
 I was givin the task to implement S/MIME. Yet, never done that before.
 I know that after some research, that every E-Mail Adress needs to be signed for encryption.
 We have roughly 150 Clients which just need to communicate to a single entity (some gov. agency). Altough the plans are to expand that in the future.
 Now I'm not sure what to do, we do not have a S/MIME Gateway (yet) and all we have atm. is an Exchange OnPrem (2013 , Update soon) and Outlook 2013/2016 on our Clients.
 I'm not sure where to start and where to go from here.
 > Purchasing S/MIME Certs and distribute them on all of the Clients
 > Letting a internal CA create User-Certs and use them to sign and just send the other entity the root CA.
 > Implementing a S/MIME Gateway (NoSpamProxy?!) and hopefully Implement it smoothly.
 I am a bit over my head here and every guidance is more than welcome :)
 Thanks!

 How big of a deal is it to fluff your resume? I don't mean outright lie, but add a bit more than is technically truthful?
 Additionally, how often to you look at college vs no college?

 Does anyone know how I can get a fix for this outside of creating another SSID or cabling all laptops to get a gpupdate with the new root CA. Is it possible to pull from the older expired cert and fix it?

 Back in the old days of copper, even if the phone system was down, we'd still be getting phone calls on the main number where messages could be taken by receptionists and emails could be sent to people asking them to call certain customers back.
 Say what you want, I still reckon copper lines were more DR proof than IP phones. I miss copper telephone lines.

 https://imgur.com/a/2H8JSy7
 It looks like well-known spammers (AdVids with their many domain variations) are somehow using our DKIM to pass DMARC alignment for their spam emails via Google forwarders. If so, I'm concerned about potential impact on our reputation, as well as how the heck that could be happening in the first place.
 Our DKIM keys for the 2 affected selectors are 2048-bit through Microsoft 365 and have been rotated 2 weeks in a row, but it doesn't seem to have affected this spam delivery in any way.
 We do also receive spam from these very domains, but when I look at the headers they're all passing their own SPF/DKIM for their many domain variations, with no mention of our domain in SPF/DKIM.
 Any thoughts or insights would be very welcome, thanks.

 Anyways, I am not having issues running the script, I am able to run it fine and it “works,” but the account I have for access needs to pass the enable password which this script doesn’t account for, so whenever it tries to create a new file using the host name via ‘show running-configuration | i host name’ it just ends up not naming the files with a host name like it’s supposed to, and overwriting them because I can’t view the running config with my account. I have been trying for a couple of hours to modify the code to allow the enable password, but I just can’t seem to figure it out. I was able to create a very basic script and use net_connect.enable() which worked for passing the enable password, but was only ran on one device and didn’t export the output to a file which is needed. After I was able to get that working, I tried adding that bit and the enable password into the ShowCollector code in multiple different areas, but ultimately couldn’t get it to work, and now I am stuck on where to add the parameters which is why I am here lookin to get some pointers/ideas on where to look! 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've come across some inconsistencies across vendors on how RSTP and RPVST interact and was wondering if anyone else deploys both to the same device or if you just default to RPVST.
 For context I the device is a 100G access switch(Arista) for some devices in research cluster. This device carries only a couple of VLANs. Management, node management, node uplinks(LACP) are pretty much it. I have both turned on ATM and see no issues but I'd rather take my chances. It will eventually become a dual switch setup in MLAGs if I ever get the sister switch delivered... T.T

 I'm not sure which sub best fits this question, but I'm trying to determine what this device is that's on my network. I first noticed the device when I added the new VLAN to my HP Aruba switch (SW02) and it grabbed an address from DHCP. Trying to determine which port it was plugged into, I ran: show mac-address on the switch and it showed that the device was connected to the trunk port, so I SSH'd into the switch that the trunk port runs to (SW01) and ran the same command, it came back showing that the MAC was attached to port 3 which is the trunk port that runs to SW02. I've checked for the MAC on every other switch on my network, as well as DHCP for all VLANS, the only place I can find this MAC address is on SW02 trunk port, and SW01 trunk port that runs to SW02.

 Please look over the basic diagram:
 https://imgur.com/a/nmMNkDW
 ​
 The SonicWall NSA and ISP at Campus B are new additions.
 We want all Internet to go out Campus A unless there is a break between campuses, then Campus B can fail-over to its ISP.
 OSPF is in use for sharing routes about various VLANs hosted on the L3 switches and the NSA at Campus A. 
 The NSA at campus A does not inject the default route into OSPF.
 I was initially going to just add a static route to the Meraki Layer 3 switch at Campus B with a metric to make it 2nd choice, but it can't set a metric for a static route.
 Should we inject the default route from the NSA at Campus A into OSPF, add NSA at Campus B to OSPF, and inject its default route and set that as a lower priority?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently learnt about the Transmission Control Block, or TCB, and I'm wondering what this means when a packet is actually forwarded from a computer's NIC or how do we use TCB and create.
 Example, Initially, as soon press enter, that the time we will build the packet which include the source(From DHCP or Static), destination (from DNS), and port information. however, the TCB also manages the connection at this point and we get the TCB/Socket information similar on how we build a packet.... So, could you please confirm that we first build the TCB that holds the socket information before actually forwarding the traffic to the nic? Is it possible to connect this during the layer-by-layer processing of the packet in the OSI representation?
 Per research, we can say TCB is the Netstat? 
 Sorry if my question is confusing, but I simply need to know how important TCB and how packets are processed with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow network nerds! :-) For many years I have been helping to send out RIPE Atlas measurement probes (world's largest open Internet measurement platform) in the US - initially a few hundred as IPv6 deployments happened. There are currently ~1,400 active probes in the US. But with some newer ISPs there are gaps that would be cool to fill - initially newer ISP connections like Starlink and 5G fixed wireless (TMo & Vz). (Next year maybe some rural FTTH ISPs.)
 In my day job[1], I just renewed our RIPE Atlas sponsorship which gives me another block of probes to deploy. If you might be interested in hosting a probe on your connection, I am guessing I will have probes be able to ship them in about a month (given the upcoming IETF meeting starting this weekend). Once you receive a probe, it connects to your network via Ethernet and you will need to use the RIPE Atlas site to activate the probe – which is about 5 mins work.
 If you might be interested, please PM with the following info: Your first & last name, your shipping address, and your email address for probe activation process.
 Don’t know what RIPE Atlas is? See https://atlas.ripe.net/ 
 Thanks! Jason
 [1] Day job is at Comcast where I work on Internet measurement and new standards and lots of other good-of-the-Internet sorts of stuff. This RIPE Atlas system is run by RIPE NCC - all I am doing is facilitating distribution of probes in the U.S. Here's a somewhat recent paper I co-wrote about Internet measurement: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3372135.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I thought I'd share some key points from a talk I did on Shadow IT as it's most often the sysadmins that have to battle with it.
 Tackling shadow IT is a never ending battle. You need to be vigilant and always looking for improvements.
 It's a human problem if your company hires humans you have shadow IT
 Decreasing friction and improving the relationship between the service provider (You) and users is the most effective way to minimize shadow IT
 You need to understand what exists where through mechanisms that can't be bypassed. Instead of importing your excel sheet of NetBIOS names into an asset inventory tool, scan all your IP ranges. You will be shocked by how much unknown stuff sits on your network.
 Tools like WDAC and App locker are great if your just starting to tackle the problem.
 Don't villainize your self by snapping at users you catch with shadow IT. Understand why it exists and what you can do provide an appropriate alternative.
 Because your always going to have Shadow IT take a risk based approach and tackle the stuff those poses the most danger even if it's easier to remove that weird app Janet in finance uses.
 Once you have a strong understanding of what's in your consistency explore more 'heavy handed' technologies like Network access control. You can use these technologies to mitigate while you solve the problem.

Anyone come across any way to do this, so they can only use the internet if they're on the local wifi, or if there is any other way to lock them down until they reconnect to the staff wifi? And yes I know, this is not ideal but this is one paranoid manager.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The last time I had to set up a firewall for a customer with this they went out and bought an internet plan without telling us, ended up getting sold on the 10x more expensive "dedicated internet" and we had so much trouble configuring the WAN as opposed to regular cable/fiber service. The provider gave two WAN schemes and were insistent upon having to use both for the service to work, referring to one group as the "LAN". I researched dedicated internet for some time and realized it is innately different than the usual internet service with shared pipes. 
 This was months ago but am seeing more events of customers signing up for this and then passing the buck to IT and it only being a problem once the cutover happens and nothing works as expected. The last thing I remember in first example was the provider suggesting I set up my "LAN" with this public scheme and basically NAT traffic from one scheme to the other to show outbound coming from their "WAN" scheme. 
 If not obvious already I feel I'm clearly missing something here: can anyone chime in on best practice to get this working as expected? Have set up countless networks and helped facilitate cutovers for businesses utilizing static WANs before, but this dedicated internet setup obviously involves more than just the WAN port config and bridge mode modem that had come to be the expectation. How do you configure this firewall side? Do you need additional physical equipment that the provider does not provide?

 I've exhausted any logs from network equipment that might shed any light on this. 
 Basically looking for a tool that I can throw on a micro pc and leave in a closet. Connect to wifi. Then see a history of ping times, speed tests, and whatever other network statistics it can throw at me by date/time. 
 This way I can deploy these to trouble spots and maybe find some data to back up the claims so my NOC will actually listen to me.
 I admit my google-fu has been weak here. 
 Anyone have any suggestions?

 The resolution is very simply for us. We go into 'Access Work or School', select 'Info' on the account, then scroll down and there should be a red message by the sync button stating the user needs to sign in to resolve an error. We re-authenticate and the problem is resolved.
 How can we implement some preventative measure for this issue, and/or make it so the user is given a prompt to re-authenticate when there is a sync issue. I know it's such a simple process for us to navigate to Access Work or School but I feel like we could cut down the number of these type of calls.

 Have a change planned to add a few extra OUs to our Azure Sync through Azure AD Connect. We've had a number of 365 accounts be deleted and have realised after a bit of digging it's because only limited OUs in our AD are syncing up.
 Process is fairly easy and I can't envision any issues - however just want to triple-confirm (as can't find any documentation that mentions it). If adding additional OUs (not removing any) - and a full import on the directory is performed on next sync cycle - will there be any outage or change expected for current users in 365?
 (Azure AD Connect -> Customize syncronization options -> Domain/OU Filtering -> Sync Selected Domains and Users -> Select all additional OUs)
 Being overly cautious, however figured it wouldn't hurt to hear from somebody who has done this also, for peace of mind.

We only have one production VM left on it, but blowing the SVM away is a little disconcerting. 
 - Do I actually need to blow away the SVM and re-create it to change the IP?
 - How can I tell if the SVM is actually used? There is traffic on the NICs assigned to it, so I'm guessing it is used, but some other proof would be nice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a few users who are getting bitten with the “my account is locked out every morning” bug. We’re hybrid, the account in O365 is fine when on-prem is locked. The usual tools and logs always point to bad password. User always claims it’s entered properly. Users are mobile, and the problems seem to occur on boot or waking up. OS is Windows 10.
 My current theory is that these lovely (/s) USB docks may be delayed in registering to Windows and identifying keyboards. And in that delay possibly the password, while being typed, isn’t keying in all the characters. Netwrix lockout auditor, DC event logs, etc, never show logon events from any other workstation, so I don’t believe it’s anything malicious. Our helpdesk is done with the problem, so it’s a sysadmin issue now. 
 My insane idea is to throw a keylogger on one of their laptops and capture what’s being typed when they have this issue. In order to see if I’m right about mistyped passwords being the culprit. Because I have a feeling if I call Microsoft, I’m going to be pissing away $500 and months of my time arguing with the level 1 crowd, and going nowhere. 
 If anyone has any other ideas, I’m game. 
 Sorry for the long post.

 This morning I have a user yelled at me that they used to work as a graphic designer 20 years ago so I need to give them local admin rights to their corporate computer so they can download some shady software that they don't want to disclose.
 I have to question myself. I am a 5 feet tall 100lbs Asian woman that looks 10 years younger than my age and work in a field that mostly for men. Is that why people think they have the rights to argue with me about how I do my own job? My boss told me not to take it personal but I can not help not to :(.

 I'm an introvert, I like to think, strategize and implement. My background is in network security mostly and I like that a lot. I used that knowledge and some people skills to work selling equipment, and even though that is not what I love and where I thrive, I can do it if I need to. I quickly learn IT products and can explain how they work. 
 I went to a trade school, studied engineering, dropped out, and went to business administration while working at Net. Sec. - I like the IT world, I'm passionate about security and privacy but I also like the processes and structures where I can create a place for teams in businesses can work and can have success in what they do. I always jokingly called myself the architect of my businesses because I can easily connect or relate all the software, systems, and processes to make sense of it for the business and find ways to leverage all of them. And now I realize that's kind of a career as well. 
 I would like to do something with my business experience and I was thinking Enterprise Architecture could be something interesting. I don't want to go back to configure firewalls or anything really. I could sell, but I rather not. 
 Has anyone of you jumped and moved laterally like me? What's your experience?
 Thanks!

 I found a contractor to run cable from my building's MPOE where ATT trunk/ciena resides to my unit a couple floors up. Now we have two path options and I'm not sure which is more ideal so would like some perspective on best practices:
  
  
Path 
  
 1) Run in conduit from MPOE to a shared telco/electrical closet (one on each floor) then terminated in a splice tray/patch panel (not sure correct term) and then from closet down a zig zag hallway (drop ceiling) into our unit where I imagine it ends up in another termination box/splice try before being handed off to ATT BGW320 gateway with pigtails. This is the longer run of the two, but I guess more modular as the cable has more sections/splices.

 Fairly new to SDWAN. Regular client has QOS policies across all their LAN switches which is typical when using MPLS to help preserve voice/video traffic etc.
 With SDWAN, my understanding is that the devices will identify the traffic type and will do its own prioritization without the need to specifically mark traffic as EF on the LAN.
 Can you help me understand this please?

 I've read the documentation, and while it's very informative, I struggle to find answers for some of the basic principles. 
 My main question is wheter the AP's require dedicated software images loaded, or if they will pull their software from the controller image named C9800-L-universalk9_wlc.17.06.04.SPA.bin. My understanding so far is that during an upgrade to new major release, AP images are included in the controller software.
 The other thing I'm questioning is which upgrade procedure is the most safe and efficient. I'm reading about SMU, hitless upgrade, ISSU etc. The customer does not have N+1, just a single controller. We have planned maintenance, so I'm not bothered with hitless upgrade etc. Should I just upload the .bin-file, select "INSTALL" mode and run the upgrade - that's it?
 ​
 Appreciate any helpful advice!

Anyway I found a bit annoying switiching between panels, I'd prefer to use some solution like SecureCRT to open multiple session to same server and easily switch tabs.

 SecureCRT is great since it allows to rapidly switch between sessions with Alt+1, Alt+2, and so on.
 MTPuTTY looks ok, but it seems can only allows to cicle between sessions (previous/next), it doesn't allow to switch to session X for example.
 What your favorite tool, if you use any? Thankyou

 So I recently started a job as a network analyst (with no prior experience, but I've been taught some aspects and self taught with guides and a lot of google). I've noticed lately users keep letting me know their internet is dead, which is odd. Every single time this has happened so far (3 times) the vlan in my switch is showing a vlan that hasn't been in use by this location for a long time. Is there any reason a switch would "default" or change the vlan on the running configuration without a user's input? Obviously it's not a big issue for me to change the vlan and watch the connection spring to life, but if there is something I'm missing I'd like to start getting ahead.

 What are other SysAdmins doing here, or can this simply not be done anymore. :(

 How much of a security vulnerability would it be to use the same MySQL user credentials in each project's .env file?
 My guess is that I should use a unique username and password for each database. Credentials which I don't actually need to memorize since at the end of the day I always have root access to my databases.
 One project's .env might look like:
 DB_DATABASE=foobar DB_USERNAME=frankzappa DB_PASSWORD=g4HEs45m220x

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[r/sysadmin patch megathread mentions that TLS 1.0 will be disabled by the 2022-10 patches on 2012r2 devices. This will, if I understand correctly, prevent the Connection Broker service from connecting to the WID database. Microsoft suggest upgrading (!!!) or moving to SQL for the Connection Broker (!!! again) OR re-enable TLS 1.0 (see Remote Desktop service (RDS) Connection Broker or Remote Desktop Management service (RDMS) fails - Windows Server | Microsoft Learn ) but they don't specify how to re-enable TLS 1.0
 I'm asking what the best way to do that is - I believe it's a combination of registry keys but I've seen differing recommendations as to what keys are required.

 I thought of Google Drive at first then quickly found out it has 750GB/day limit on bandwidth

 We had several users lose connectivity in Outlook after basic auth was disabled. My fix ended up being to change EnableADAL key to a value of 1, but can’t understand why these clients were opting to use basic auth to begin with?
 My understanding is that 2016 should default to MA, unless explicitly told to use legacy via registry keys. 
 I’ve been reading/researching for hours now and see a few similar questions, but no answers.
 Edit: a word
 Edit 2: A) is the enableADAL key added to the registry automatically when installing Office 2016? If so, is there anything other than manual intervention that would set the value to 0? If not, how does this key get added to the registry other than manually?

 Thankfully some of the guys from the previous IT team were nice enough to provide any and all of their documentation. I still have a lot to go through but I was immediately impressed by not just WHAT they documented but HOW they documented it.
 This made me realize that while it is widely agreed that documentation is critical it has never been anything I've been taught or even shown how to do. Several times over the years I've felt there were better ways I could be doing my documentation but when trying to research methods or templates I would get nowhere.
 Obviously there is the catch that to show how you format and do your documentation you would have to either censor all of your actual data or take the time to input dummy data. Curious to see how you guys are able to explain or even demonstrate HOW you do your documentation.
 PS - Drink every time I said "documentation"

 You may then check the compatibility list and find your processor on it like I did. You may even find previous reports of the 6226 processor being bugged.
 Don't worry your not going insane, the compatibility checker is just broken but fear not you can bypass it with the following registry key. Create the following a DWORD registry with a Value of 1 to bypass this faulty check and allow for upgrading.

 There were no Bad passwords logged.
 It’s in a hybrid 365 environment and azure ad does not see anything related to these lockouts.
 Anyone have any leads on where to look for a global lockout?

 I’ve seen the 2013 and 2019 revisions and I can’t seem to find any good references to what the IT org is asking for. All of the ISO stuff looks very generic and non-specific.
 For example, IT org says we need keycard entry into the server room. Ok great we have that. But to me it looks like the point of ISO is that you create a policy, you test it, and you stick to it. I don’t see where I’m ISO it say you need keycard access. The policy of my company doesn’t say you need a keycard access either.
 So is the gap that my company doesn’t have a policy that says you need keycard access or am I missing the something?
 EDIT: I’m just a cog in the machine trying to understand a high-level view of the process. By no means did I intend to imply I was managing this project or writing policies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for a financial company and about a year ago, our security team put a policy in place to forensically image every computer used by a previous employee. We use various cloud platforms to back up the important stuff, but they set this up to get every thing on the local machine “just in case” 
 It is incredibly time consuming and in constant need of attention or process change due to OS updates or our MDM applying new policies, and that the software/devices perform very intermittently. 
 We use Cellebrite digital collectors (MacQ) for our Mac and Windows computers. Apple is already more difficult to navigate with this, and we still cannot obtain full images from M1 macs. I run into constant issues with the software freezing/crashing and, without any issues, the image can take anywhere from 1-5 hours to complete, so coupled with these issues, I can spend days working on these and make very little progress. 
 Since starting this work, I don’t believe even one file has ever been booted with an actual need to find something. 
 I am having a hard time seeing exactly why we need to have these images. With all the systems in place to record an employee’s work and the machines activity, I just don’t see how booting these images up later can be too useful. When researching, it seems like I am in a pretty narrow use-case, and it seems like there would be better tools and documentation if this was a larger and needed operation. But, maybe it’s the standard and I just have to keep pushing to get this into a good flow. 
 How does your org handle this?

 I'd like to completely remove the social media images and just have the website. I am considering hosting the logo on our website, so we no longer have the attachments. Any other suggestions? Is the hosting of the logo on the website not a good idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just started my new sysadmin job (finally away from help desk!) and I'm now responsible for managing New Relic for my company. Both of these apps are new to me.
 I've been getting alerts from one of our web servers having over 80% space used. I checked it out and it looks like that New Relic is currently using up 16GB of logs in "C:\ProgramData\New Relic\.NET Agent\Logs". I have a feeling this probably isn't necessary.
 Two questions:
  
Is there any way to enable some kind of log rotation here? It looks like we're using the .Net agent. After scouring the documentation for hours, all I can find is info on how to do this for the Java agent. Is there no way to set this up with the .Net agent? If so, how?
 If log rotation isn't a thing for the .Net agent. Would I be safe in archiving (or deleting) most of these logs? Would this effect our New Relic instance?

 This is such a niche topic so I apologise that I am trying to find a needle in a haystack here, but I have some Alcatel Lucent 8028 phones authenticating using 802.1x. They send their certificates to my Cisco ISE server, but the certificate chain is incomplete so they get rejected (as they should!).
 All I need is to acquire the root cert for Alcatel "Wired Phones", but this appears to be much harder than it should be. I have found the below in a forum:
  
The certificates from the Alkatel business portal doesn't work as these are not the correct CA's signed the certificate of the phone. You have to obtain the correct CA "Wired Phones" from your Alkatel local vendor. 
  
Does anyone happen to have obtained this certificate? And if they have, can they please share it? 
 Thank You

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a firewall and two linux servers. I would like to aggregate the logs in a central location, run some basic analysis to identify potential issues and, ideally, be alerted when issues are identified. I realize a full SIEM implementation is probably beyond my budget and pay grade but would like to improve our logging and use of our logs. My goal is to reduce the amount of time I spend inspecting logs on 3 different machines.
 One server is remote and should connect via TLS, the firewall and other server are on the same local network I wish to implement the log server. I prefer opens source on windows but I am willing to consider a Linux based solution as well. Spending a little money is an option if the feature justify the expense but I really don't have a budget for this.
 I've discovered there are a plethora of tools ranging from simple log servers to full SIEM available with a dramatic range in prices. I would really appreciate it if someone could help steer me in a good direction to help me understand what people enjoy using and find appropriate for small environments like mine. I imagine, like in many other areas of IT, there are certain tools that get used a lot and have more active communities. Thanks!

 It doesnt require expensive software to have the visibility or awareness of an incident like this. Does anyone have some insights to GOV IT and how this was even allowed?

 ​
  
I'm using VMWare Workstation to avoid pesky/obtrusive software from accessing my PC
 The employer made me install "Remote Desktop". So now I'm controlling the VMWare and then again through "Remote Desktop" to access the organization's remote desktop.
  
How would I go about working during my trip? They don't allow foreign IP addresses or VPNs. Therefore, the only option is to use a remote control desktop tool such as AnyDesk, Remote Desktop or TeamViewer. This would make the entire thing 3 layered:
 Layer 1: controlling my laptop from foreign country with another laptop
 Layer 2: using VMware on my remote laptop
 Layer 3: using Remote Desktop to access their remote desktop
 Any thoughts? I'll be testing before the trip to ensure it works, but any feedback would be much appreciated.

 Already told him that while I agree that SCEP/NDES is old, its anything but obsolete. If only when using MS ADCS.
 Obviously there's modern protocol, next to custom REST API, such as EST, CMPv2 and ACME
 Me and my colleague find it pretty challenging to get a list of known brands/applications that actually still support SCEP/NDES based certificate requests, as well as those that support EST, CMPv2. 
 A lot of CISCO solutions support EST (such as ISE), but hopefully some of you in this community can help me with other applications/network equipment that supports SCEP/NDES, EST, CMPv2?

About the top warning one, I never had such problem with it, the first time it appears and the second one in the low part I don't know what it means.
 And when I login on Eve website my machines in labs won't start up, so I thought it could be a RAM issue, but it can't be that because these exact machines always started with any kind of problem and if I give more RAM the virtual machine won't start.

 Recently took over a site and their VC provider has told us our CVI BlueJeans is coming up for renewal. 
 Currently all our meeting rooms have been upgraded to dedicated Yealink MTR over the last year with no legacy devices remaining. 
 I questioned this as in my mind, if our devices are native Teams MTRs then why would we need a bridge but the response was it is needed for any external parties joining from older devices. 
 " The tenancy hosting the teams meeting must have the tenancy with the gateway. It won’t work if a guest has the gateway."
 ​
 Is that correct?

 What is the best way to do this now? I've read that they have taken away the silent-option for non-enterprise editions and I see several PS-scripts on spiceworks and whatnot, but I don't know which one is the best one to use.
 And while we're at it, is storing the keys in AD the most safe/reliable approach? (Haven't done that before.)

 One for games and stuff, where for example it can't be outruled that from time to time something like a mod gets downloaded from a less trustworthy website. The other one shall be for working and for important as well as sensitive data.
 Windows will run on both.
 But how do I seperate these systems? From what I've read, dual boot doesn't really increase safety: If maleware makes it onto one system, it's likely to infect all connected partitions and hard drives.
 Does using BitLocker for the respective partitions/hard drives improve security?
 Switches for 2.5" and 3.5" sata-drives exist, but I'd rather not downgrade from my currently used M.2-ssd.
 Is there any other option than using two seperate computers? How do you handle this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently running three Windows Server VM's for a small business running some accounting software. Two of them are D4s v3's (4 vCPU + 16GiB RAM), and the last is a B2s (2 vCPU + 4 GiB RAM). There's a reservation in place which brings the monthly bill to approximately C$650 (US$476). This is getting a bit too expensive, especially considering that we'd like to add another VM. From looking at the bill, it seems that the main cost is the Windows Server VM License cost. Aside from the cost, the setup is optimal for the owner of the business as all of the employees can login at once (2 max per VM) and the work is synced through the use of SyncThing.
 ​
 Is there a recommended alternative that we can switch to? Or is this license cost going to exist everywhere? I've looked into it and saw that big names such as GCP have similar price ranges, whereas relatively unknown companies like Kamatera have cheaper prices. I'd appreciate any input.

Why does a connection get a fraction of the transmission capacity? This makes no sense to me.
 In the TDM, you're switching between circuits, but the speed of the link doesn't go down based on the number of active circuits. But I guess you could argue that the transmission rate is reduced since you're not sending data when the circuit switched from you to others, so it's a if the network is slower, but when you're sending data, you're sending it at full speed possible by the link. But I don't understand why a 1Mbps link is quartered to 250kbps if there are 4 circuits? Or is this saying the same thing I said, it's a if the link speed is reduced?
 In the FDM, this makes completely no sense to me. You're dividing the spectrum, but you're sending stuff in parallel and at full speed just with its own bandwidth. No?

 I used to be working at a MSP as a consultant doing it all (from fixing printers to setting up servers). Im not great at anything but i have a broad knowlage base to stand on. I worked for this customer and they hired me as a IT-Manager last year. I am currently alone doing everything IT-related for the business.
 ​
 Now they want me to present a 5 year roadmap for IT and as this is a first for me i wanted to get your feedback on whats important to add to the presentation?
 ​
 My first thoughts are 
  
IT-Security withing the company and how to educate users (its almost non existant, before me there was no MFA, no general knowlage about security, no password on the company wifi etc).
 How to reduce costs
 Documentation
 Going Cloud (started to tamper with intune for easier computer management)

 Everything is helpful :)

 To do this I set up Generic SAML Service Provider - Single Sign-On, and applied it to the OU where the users will be. On Google's side, I also set "Have Google Prompt for their username" on the SSO Profile assignment. If I use "Require users to enter their Google Username", it doesn't prompt for MFA. 
 When signing into Google, I get a typical Google login page. After putting in the username, it then dumps me to Duo's login page, prompting me to put the username in again. 
 Is there any way I can change that behavior so that Google passes the account name to Duo so my users don't have to type the username in twice?

However, that seems counter intuitive. Usually I would prefer to physically have the router/firewall between the internet and the rest of the LAN, and not just virtually. Can VLANs be trusted to virtually separate the internet from the rest of the LAN? Or am I asking for trouble?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whenever I look up the benefits of http3, I see mostly the fast connection starts and the faster handling of errors. However, it seems to me that using udp instead of udp, would increase the speed of downloads substantially. For instance, if your ping is 100ms and your windows size is 32KB, then you are limited to 2.4Mbps to wait for the ack packet to come back. If you don't have to wait for the ack packet, couldn't you get the full network speed download of 1gbps (assuming that is what you pay for and the server also pays for that upload). That is a huge difference in bandwidth. Am I missing something?

I've never done any MSP or ISP networking in that time either. I have a great work/life balance right now and my employer is pretty good. I have 2 in office days and the other 3 are virtual days. Work only takes up maybe 4 hours of my average day, and nothing is too challenging right now to me. My team is about 6 network admins and a manager. Medium size environment. 
 I'm thinking that I'm getting bored where I'm at now. I've been thinking about making a move to something else. I'm looking at cloud networking, or maybe something virtual like NSX. I've worked with NSX about 5 years ago but I don't know how much since then it may have changed, or if it's even still something orgs are using. Is there anyone in these jobs who wouldn't mind sharing what an average day is? Are you work from home, hybrid, or in office? What's the work/life balance in your job?

 I had searched this question earlier, but didn't get a convincing reply. And today i was asked this question and couldn't answer. :( Could you please help with specific answers?
 Two scenarios:
  
Area1 > Area0 > Area2 > Area1: Area 1 and 2 have direct connectivity using an ABR. Will Area 1 routes be advertised into Area 2 through the common ABR? If yes, will it cause any routing loop? If No, How will OSPF avoid the loop?
 Area 1 > Area 2 using two ABRs. There is no Area 0. Will the routes be advertised between Areas? If yes, will it cause routing Loops? If No, how will OSPF prevent the loop?
  
I know Inter Area OSPF works like Distance vector (As per many answers i found on other posts), but still not clear how OSPF avoids loops in above scenarios.
 Thanks.

I manage 3 sites so consolidating and automating management is ideal.
 I see Ansible looks to have collections for each and they both have python SDKs. Both of those tools I would like to use and learn more of. Maybe a preference of python but I could imagine how Ansible could be better for the job.
 Any suggestions? Other tools to use? Personal experiences? Bummed we leverage Meraki but it is what it is.

 A parody song basically introduced the IT staff to OpenSUSE. They did some digging and eventually completely migrated to OpenSUSE back in 2018. This song is basically the IT department's theme song. Thought I'd share this little fun bit from my day working with a really cool group of IT folks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello gents,
 you may find this a funny story, but I started recently to work for a data center provider in Europe. Initially, we were not carrier neutral so we had been trying to resell the internet traffic we purchased from tier 1-2 carriers to our clients as our own service. I mean it works well, as long as the customers aren't the smartest ones and are ready to pay for it. 
 As I am one of the most experienced guys when it comes to carrier network (even thought I am in telco and carrier sales for more than 15 years) they now asking me to develop and establish 2 new products.
  
Become a carrier neutral DC
 Develope a Business Plan for a IP transit product
  
Regarding the first task.
 I am fine with it, as this had been my key business my entire career. The challenge is: They want me to offer these services (carrier neutral) only to the new clients, but not to the existing ones. So they want carriers to join, but will not allow them to approach existing customers, which is nonsense. IMHO. Why should carriers join us if they are not able to do their business and with whom? I need to write a business plan for that and maybe anybody has any kind of templates or something I can use, I would really appreciate it. 
 Regarding the IP Transit Product.
 I need to write a business plan and present it - even though, again, I am not a product designer nor manager, I used to be sales all my 15 years in DC Business. But that's ok, I don't have any choice. So any plans how I can start? 
 Thanks in advance...
 PS: Sorry English is my 3rd language

We’re just trying to figure out a way to standardize our builds but not have to worry about laptops with code and PII on them disappearing or if someone’s got a hardware prototype that gets stolen.

 My company uses GCP and we found the pricing for their VPN pretty confusing. When I was researching a pricing calculator similar to the one u/PFK_Manager made on AWS, I struck out, so I worked with someone at my company to research and create one. If you think AWS VPN pricing is complicated to calculate, Google’s is even worse…
 Here is a calculator for GCP VPN to hopefully save others the trouble we went through. Google’s pricing and documentation was so convoluted that we actually caught some mistakes in their own pricing examples. My summary is below but we also have a full write up here. 
 How Google Cloud VPN Pricing works
 There are three components:

 "Authentication failed for EAP method type 13. The error was 0x80090331."
 GoogleFu says that error is something like "The client and server cannot communicate, because they do not possess a common algorithm."
 Wireshark packet captures of the EAP conversation show the client sending its list of ciphers it supports in the Client-Hello, and then the Server-Hello coming back using one of those ciphers. But the Windows 10 host stops responding and simply says it could not connect when using the smartcard.
 The same host works fine when using the computer certificate and the cipher exchange looks the same in that case.
 Is there a deeper/better way to get Windows to show me more information so I can figure out what cipher mismatch it thinks it has ? Has anyone seen this error before for EAP-TLS ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a lot of responsibilities besides being a sysadmin. And, like a lot of you I imagine, I’m responsible for the care and feeding of things in a lot of different domains. Some of those domains I have a lot of experience in, some not so much. 
 Because I don’t have the resources or bandwidth to research and test ALL updates for example, I rely on the vendor (or trusted third party) to tell me how critical a vulnerability is to know how soon it needs to be patched. MSFT says there’s a domain controller vulnerability, deploy it to one DC today, the rest tomorrow. I generally don’t try to do an analysis to determine for each vulnerability or update how susceptible we might be. I know I can get burned this way, but I rather risk getting burned by a patch than leaving a known vulnerability in place. I do check reddit to see if a patch Tuesday is particularly rough. Standing on the shoulders of giants if you will.
 I kind of apply this same rule in other domains where I have found best practice dashboards. I know that it won’t find all the problems, but I’m hoping it will at least help us avoid the most common pitfalls.
 Here are some that I use: * AWS - Security Hub, Trusted Advisor * Azure - Advisor * Office 365 - Security checklists (forgot name?) * Microsoft Endpoint Manager - Security Score * Crowdstrike - Spotlight * Custom Dashboards - Grafana, Graylog, misc
 What tools do you use? Does anyone have a great tool for AD/GPO tuneups?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently studying for the CompTIA Network+ certification and I'm reading Mike Meyers' Network+ 8th edition exam guide. I'm currently in the last chapter on Network Troubleshooting, on the section ipconfig/ifconfig/ip. He shows an example of the macOS/UNIX ifconfig output, and on the inet line it says:
  
inet 192.168.4.78 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.4.255 
  
I'm just wondering why does the netmask show in hex and not dotted decimal or CIDR notation? Wouldn't it normally be written as 255.255.255.0 or /24? 
 This seems to be specific to the ifconfig output, as ipconfig shows the subnet mask with dotted decimal notation, and ip shows CIDR notation. This is the first time I've even seen a hex netmask, as literally the rest of the book has used dotted decimal or CIDR notation. Even in my limited real world experience troubleshooting computers and networks, I've never seen a hex netmask.
 I've tried Googling the answer, but most of what I found was just decimal to hexadecimal conversion charts, or talking about hexadecimal in a general sense not really networking focused. From what I read I think it might just be a remnant of the early mainframes and UNIX systems, and the language they ran on. But I can't find anything definitive about it. 
 I don't think it ultimately matters what notation the subnet/netmask are written in, but I am I wrong is there some system out there where I'll need to know how to convert binary to hex for subnetting?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am working to start a small rural ISP and am trying to better understanding of carrier scale routing. My background is in the physical infrastructure side, and I would like to have a good quality rough draft before we start .
 ​
 https://imgur.com/a/yRteSjS is the diagram I'm working with. The use case is, we have 10 small communities where we'd like to provide FTTH.
  
We will have two edge facilities. Each edge has 3 routers.
 Each community distribution site will have a link back to each edge facility. The pair of routers at a community will be in VRRP (or HSRP if the router has it).
 The goal is to be a native IPv6 environment. We will have one ASN.
  
Can eBGP, iBGP, and/or OSPF be used to implement a multi-home multi-path load shared environment as diagrammed?
 Given we will be IPv6 native, what would the best practice be for handling IPv4 bound traffic in this environment?
 ​
 Thank you,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have about 20-30 deployed PC's all across the country running a custom application as their sole job, and I have very few issues with them. The majority of the issues I do get relate to windows updates or nagging. I run them on a local account, not a Microsoft account, and every few months something will happen where it starts asking to switch to a microsoft account or change all of the default browsers or other settings. The users running the application just start clicking through and it brings it out of the validated state and breaks things and I have to log in and change everything back.
 How do I tell windows I want updates, but I don't want any default app, account, or other major changes? Seems like there should be a way to do this, but I am not finding anything good so far.

 So my wife is a database developer and she knows SQL like a second langue. She can whip insane queries in minutes that would take me days to build (and still be kind of shitty). Anyway, I don't do this often but once in a while I'm stuck on something and just holler at her like "hey, babe can you check this syntax is OK" or I'm sitting there and she comes in to see what I'm doing and we end up going over one. It goes the other way also, there have been quite a few times we are staring at her screen chewing over a problem.
 To me, it's not a big deal, it's fun sitting together and figuring out a problem (sometimes we end up spending the evening "watching Netflix"), and besides, we both benefit from the money I make from the job.
 But to be clear we never sit in the same room when we are working from home. There's a fine line between spending too much time with your spouse. lol

 Today, my team was involved and managed to identify the maximum body size that could be used in that Dev Server: 1.35KB (I was in awe). More than that, timeout.
 I then involved the network team, no issues. Checked Firewall, no issues. Checked VMware, no issues either. So I decided to test the Webservice from other servers (using Invoke-WebRequest) within the same site: worked. Test the WS in the same VLAN: worked. 
 Narrowed to the same dev server. There was no error log, no other issues.
 So I asked. "Hey, have you tried rebooting the server today or in the last few weeks?" (this is a dev server, so one of them have that privilege). "No".
 Rebooted the server. 
 WS now worked properly.
 WTF Microsoft?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently have a DFS Replication group configured to sync files between two servers.
 The share being sync'd exists on its own drive on each server, so data compared on the drives would be 1:1. 
 Data as it exists on Server A (parent share) 1.6TB used (402 GB free on the drive). A few days into replication now and I have had to expand the drive 3 times now on Server B, as it has completely filled up its first allocation of 2TB far exceeding the 1.6TB of data it should be getting.
 DFSRprivate does exist within the the share, however the staging area was allotted 40GB and conflict/deletion area 20GB. So if factoring in that space, there is no way (that I am aware of) for that area to contribute to the extra 600 GB (and counting) of data making it's way onto Server B during this replication. Windirstat also confirms only ~40GB of date in there.
 Curious if anyone out there has seen this behavior before, is this common, something I messed up? Any help would be appreciated, Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Help with network setup for small business
 Hello,
 I am a software engineer but I don’t know a lot about networking hardware. I would like to have an idea of what needs to be done to setup a network on a 3 floor building for a small business.
 There will be 26 computers connected through Ethernet (wiring is already in place), and approximately 50 concurrent wifi users, so I guess I’m going to need to place an access point on every floor for wifi.
 There is a small IT room, where I’ll place the router, switches, camera DVRs, etc… though currently I haven’t bought any of the hardware, just the Ethernet wiring from the IT room to the computers.
 Another thing I want to plan for is a possible internet failure, since internet connections in the area are very unreliable, I want a backup fiber connection in case the main one has problems.
 So basically I would really appreciate some guiding regarding a good setup for this. Budget is approximately $3000.
 Thanks in advance

 I'm a full-time student at Oregon Tech with a full-time job. I am set to graduate soon and need to do a Capstone project. OIT, for some bizarre reason, does not provide project sponsors to students and you are expected to find one in a span of about two weeks. Yes you read that right - you need to find a project sponsor with a Capstone-level project lying around for you to complete on top of managing your established work schedule (we're a commuter school). This is obviously insane and thankfully they offer the option to do a research project instead and write about your findings.
 My problem is... I don't really know what to research. Specifically, our project needs to bring to light a problem in the world and how we can apply our knowledge to fixing that problem. My focus for my degree was on Network and Systems Administration. I know how networking equipment/the internet works, how AD works, some basic programming, took several business courses, and learned a bit about cybersecurity along the way.
 My original project idea was how IoT implementation can benefit businesses and the security risks with IoT devices. My advisor doesn't really like this idea and insists that it won't be a big enough topic to fill 350 hours of work for the next year. I worry she may be right, but she doesn't seem to be giving me any usable project ideas. 
 Any idea what kind of research project could fit the bill? Something networking/security or business-adjacent would be highly preferable. Thanks for the help, and feel free to ask me whatever.

 Before I went live with them I had no issues with slow logins on SSH (like 2sec to get in after entering pw) and our observium was polling snmp without any issues. 
 Now however the sign-in takes 80-100sec and they stop to respond to snmp polls once every hour. The network however works 100% fine. If you ping any interface on it I don’t lose a single ping. Cpu hovers around 10% and memory around 40%. 
 Anyone experienced this issue before? I’m running the latest os10 10.5.4.3.

 So I’m wondering what the most efficient way of doing this is. In the past for smaller sites I’ve removed the old server from the replication group, stood up a new VM and added to the group, kicked off replication and waited. I don’t want to do that this time though due to the amount of data. 
 So do I stand up a new VM side-by-side with Server01, robocopy the data, then when I’m ready rename and change the IP of Server01 and put that IP and host name on the new VM? If this is best, do I need to exclude dfsrprivate?
 I’ve also considered adding the new VM to the replication group with a name like Server02 while Server01 is still in production. Then wait for replication to finish, then (overnight) rename, remove from group and power off Server01 and then rename Server02 ‘Server01’. I feel like that’s a bad idea but I need to hear someone say it!
 Or is there a better method that I haven’t considered yet? Any suggestions and/or help is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an architecture question and was hoping one or some of you networking geniuses could help me out. 
 I am implementing an architecture where agnostic front ends will send backend requests to load balanced reverse proxies. The complication I am facing is that each backend is individual to an organization, so each backend will be spun up in its own environment (containers), but the routing BETWEEN the front end and the organization’s specific backend container is where I am having trouble. 
 The simple solution that comes to mind is to use a header and implement some sort of header-based lookup to obtain either IPs or DNS names to route to the correct upstream. I feel like there’s a million and one ways to do this but I feel like I’m missing the “right” (simple/robust/scalable) way to do it. 
 The goal will be to deploy agnostic front ends as needed based on load, and then auto deploy a backend/middleware-with-lookup-table/updated-proxy-config for each organization that joins. 
 Have any of you solved this type of routing issue? Am I missing something to simplify this process? Any help is appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello and happy Saturday :)
 Over the span of a few weeks now I've been working towards improving our network efficiency and speed as it relates to a few Databases we have over two sites.
 The sites are connected over site to site vpn, thus the traversed traffic has a secuirty packet overhead, reducing the mtu available to 1438
 That number was found by doing ping -f [some-ip] -l 1400 then modifying the number to ensure there was no packet fragmentation, that number plus the 28 bit header gave me 1438, however not the point I just wanted to provide context.
 From there I investigated manipulating the MTU via GPO, I came up empty handed however knew there were other options... Option 26 to be presice.
 I added option 26 to our dhcp server, did a reboot on an end device, a forced release/renew, and the mtu ( checked with netsh interface ipv4 show subinterface showed the same default 1500
 from there I grabbed wireshark, grabbed a capture of the renewal, and the ack does show option 26 with the correct value.
 I've checked the logs within the client however there are no entries or evidence that windows knows what to do with this information.
 so, can you help me with a few questions: 1. why does windows not honour dhcp options, speicifcally option 26? and 2. how would you go about modifying the MTU for client devices?
 ty for taking the time and have a great weekend everyone :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would be very greatful if more knowledgeable members of this community would help me find some puzzling answers regarding proper disk benchmarking.
 Here is what I have gathered so far:
 High queue with small block size based on median of files stored on the server usually 16KB-128KB
 Random not sequential read/write depending on read write stats in my case usually 95/5 read/write for web files and 80/20 for database. 
 Fsync on, system memory (ram) cache disabled directly in apps used in my case database ( buffer in mysql disabled ), web server ( file logs disabled ), language parser (in case of php opcache file timestamps disabled, error log to file disabled ), any logging and monitoring apps disabled
 Block sector of disk during formatting anf filesystem is equal between tested drives.
 Fill system memory loaded to the 99% to make sure os especially linux doesn't use ram as cache for file operations. Swap file disabled.
 Also because duplicated files in linux are referenced not physically duplicated try to make unique files.
 Also always check extreme parameters like 100% read or write workload or test very small 1KB or 1GB to avoid lags when for example somebody decides to upload big file or put this file as a blob to the database. 
 Analyze data in a statistical manner. When parameters are gradually increased look for linear or logarithmic spread of the results to ensure disk performance is predictable
  
Is there anything more to know when benchmarking disks to choose the optimal one ?
 
I'm wondering if apps for automatic tests like webdriver io imitating concurrent users in not so random fashion should be used beside the usual fio and sysbench i use ?
 
I know that linux filesystem is little different due to points I mentioned earlier, is there anything else worth knowing in this subject which may affect the results of benchmark disk ?

Had him on the phone for about 10 minutes and said he didn’t need to be on the phone while I fix this so I would call him back. We hang up and I see him working on his computer (obviously I can’t work while he’s working). I message him twice - once on the app and again on Teams to say only one can work on the computer at a time - no response. An hour and a half passes before he says “sorry, let’s reschedule for tomorrow at 2”. I say fine and call him and 2PM the next day on Teams - rings once and stops. I figure he’s on a call and rejected my call or my call just didn’t go through so I message him - no answer. I was contemplating going upstairs to my main PC where my kid was (I was in the garage) but decided to stay to see if I could reach him. I call him again 10 minutes later and he says “meeting went over - 10 minutes?” This is when I hear my wife yelling my name because my baby fell from the bed about 2 and a half feet asking me if we should go to the hospital. The part that’s pissing me off is this end-user who #1 didn’t have the common sense or listen to me when I said I’m going to work on his PC and to leave his shit alone, #2 I’m trying to baby sit this end-user because he wasn’t courteous enough to give me a heads up that he was late earlier. I feel as if I could’ve helped my son if it wasn’t for this douchebag.

 First I would like to apologize for my English, I'm from Brazil and I'm using the translator.
 We currently use in the company Aruba Instant On for Switch, Unifi for Wireless. We are going to move to another building and with that came the opportunity to improve our infrastructure. Our company is considered average here in Brazil, we work with road infrastructure works and at the office we currently have 80 users with a tendency to grow. There are about 200 devices. Now are my doubts.
 In the above scenario, does Aruba's Instant On line still serve us or should we think about Aruba Enterprise? For wireless we intend to migrate to another company considering that Ubiquiti does not have support, which one should we consider for our case?

 We are fully cloud and a requirement has come up to implement unique logins for our WiFi & VPN. We are using Microsoft AAD as our identity provider. Plan is to also implement 2FA for our VPN by leveraging the AAD MFA extension for the NPS server.

 I know the obvious answer is a ring topology, but this is a little unusual right? This is in an industrial type environment on an air-gapped system.
 Are there any benefits to running a network like this?

 One of the more affordable HDD options are the 1.92TB 400-AXSD , which are marked as "Read Intensive SSD" when you get into the quote.
 We're considering putting 4x of these in raid10
 What is the overall performance of these drives like, are they equivalent to consumer sata SSDS when it comes to write speeds or are they substantially slower when writing data?

 There are some who are just running into this because they haven't enabled modern authentication on a tenant. If you have found yourself in that situation; I hope this may be of help to you.
 I may have missed it in documentation, but the following were not obvious to me as a newbie to oauth2, and didn't come up in the searches of the forums:
 You do need to have ssl enabled bindings
 While the redirect URL does not have to be publicly resolvable, using loopback fails on machines other than the server itself for obvious reasons. To use a non-loopback URL, ssl must be enabled. Self signed works.
 There are two separate Microsoft guides on osTicket's site, one for SSO (portal) and the other to enable an email fetch. It is easy to confuse the two via search terms.
 Good luck.

 I am the sole network engineer and am making changes left and right to get things up to speed from the prior self-proclaimed engineer.
 We have not been impressed with their support or their implementation of SDWAN. It is legitimately just FortiGates following Fortinets MSP cookbook examples with a few changes. An insane amount of money for something I can do on my own faster, better and more reliably. 
 They use FortiManager and RestAPI Admins to pull analytics into their dashboard. We could get our own appliance for FMG and FAZ to accomplish this. 
 Why does this feel like a product designed for organizations without a dedicated network engineer? Am I missing the value here? Please, help me understand.

 robocopy 4TBDRIVE:\ \\NETWORKLOCATION\SAN /MT:1 /r:0 /w:0 
 I've been able to get some files off, but robocopy keeps getting stuck on certain files, obviously ones with bad sectors. I haven't figured out a way to get it to skip these and move onto the next if the percent copied doesn't move in say 1 minute ... it just sits there forever, until I stop the copy, go into the disk, delete the file and start all over. There is about 2000 files I need to copy off so I am hoping that there is a better way.

 Has anyone seen issues since the October updates?
  
"Because of these additional protections, domain join operations are intentionally prevented from re-using an existing computer account in the target domain.Domain join operations will be blocked automatically after installing the October 2022 security updates on client computers due to additional security checks before re-using an existing computer account (the changes do not affect new accounts).
  
I assume since most people's "golden" images are a little older (e.g. most recent updates aren't slipstreamed), and most domain-join operations occur during imaging before the OS is patched, this might be going under the radar.
 More from the article:
  
This happens unless the user attempting to join the domain does not have the appropriate write permissions (i.e., the user is the creator of the existing account or the computer was created by a domain administrator).Microsoft explained that domain join processes might intentionally fail with "0xaac (2732): NERR_AccountReuseBlockedByPolicy" errors saying that "An account with the same name exists in Active Directory. Re-using the account was blocked by security policy.""Affected scenarios include some domain join or re-imaging operations where a computer account was created or pre-staged by a different identity than the identity used to join or re-join the computer to the domain."
  
Hopefully this isn't as dastardly as it sounds...?

Perhaps I'm just very green, but we have about 300 production servers with all the apps and services that run on them coming to about 500+.
 I'm a new Sysadmin straight out of college with some internship experience and a little bit of freelance as well as personal home-lab setup. However, I'm a little overwhelmed by the size of what I'm getting into with this job. I'm very excited, but I am unsure on how to best go about just getting an understanding and layout of the IT infrastructure. My team is about 3 including myself and while they are happy to answer questions, it's unreasonable to ask them to sit-down and talk me through each server and what it does. 
 Do others have any tips, tricks or suggestions on how to just familiarize myself with the infrastructure?
 I've been given the job of building out a Zabbix server for monitoring purposes and that seems to be a really good way to start as it will force me to become familiar with everything. However,it is also hard to figure out what to monitor and how best to setup useful alerts if I don't know the infrastructure.

 I just tried attaching a visio, but /r networking wont allow images?
 I'm planning out architecture for SD wan mesh behind 2 BGP routers and after going through the documentation and videos; I really can't figure out a way to define two different paths out of the network coming from a singular /24. Typically you'd create your sdwan interfaces and prefer one etc, but i only have one interface.
 Can't do anything tricky with private IP space due to port-forwarding/ipsec and overall firewalling. Im thinking im going to need to re-configure the OUTSIDE interfaces with BGP and get rid of the route redistribution down to EIGRP. But even if I do; i still only have one interfaces
 Architecture
 2 Edge routers bgp peered between each other, distro'd EIGRP down to the firewalls (going to migrate to ospf cuz fortigate). 
 Hoping to get SD Wan set up to pipe critical org traffic out primary ISP and youtube/fb out the secondary ISP.

 The guy that taught me everything fibre channel gave me a list and order of troubleshooting steps. I have tried to reconstruct them here. As this was 10 years ago, it may not be 100% what he said, but I think it's pretty close.
 troubleshooting FC:
  
host (initiator) HBA driver
 host HBA status
 switch port for initiator
 cabling to initiator
 zoning connecting the initiator to target
 cabling to target
 port on target
 LUN to port mapping
 port security
  
Start with 1 and go to 9, for all things able to be checked remotely first, then check physical. 3-7 can be checked partially with one step, checking the switch to make sure they show links. This excludes 90% of issues. Leave checking the physical cabling and SFPs until all others are excluded. So, troubleshooting order should be 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 3/4, 6/7
 May it be useful to someone, someday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd love to hear comments from people using EEE in real life. I recently tested a 48 port switch with all ports connected but with no traffic and saw a decrease in actual power consumption in the switch of ~15%. It was measured with an external current clamp meter, so pretty exact readings and not what the switch measured. 15% is not massive and when traffic actually starts to flow, that will decrease of course. What kind of accumulated savings do you see in your network?
 Have you seen problems with it? Why is it not the default settings if it has no adverse effects?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Evening all,
 We go through quite a lot of headsets and bought a load of Manhattan USB headsets from our regular supplier.
 We also use sophos endpoint and use it’s usb device protection features, most devices are blocked unless we allow them.
 Storage devices are certainly heavily restricted, so strangely, we found new, out of the packet headsets, that are being blocked because they have storage in them.
 Tested on a machine that is isolated from the network and doesn’t have sophos on it, and found that it does indeed show a storage device, but doesn’t show up any drive.
 My first thought is that it’s a small batch of devices that may have been tampered with and is collecting audio. Which if it’s the case, is very bad.
 But if it’s not, what is it for, considering other “identical” model devices from the same order don’t have it at all.
 What can I do to try and figure it out, or should I just bring it up with the supplier/Manhattan?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are using M365 for email hosting with our MX records pointing to Mimecast as our primary email security solution. In recent months we have noticed more phishing emails being allowed through Mimecast and delivered to our users. We have very little in the way of EOP policies in place, our original thinking being that Mimecast is our email security layer in the first instance, not EOP. We're now thinking about enabling the policies in EOP to act as a second line of defence. We've even noticed genuine phishing emails that have come through Mimecast to then be flagged as phishing by EOP, but delivered to user mailboxes due to our EOP Anti-spam -> Connection filter policy that has all the Mimecast IPs within it, which then bypasses the majority of checks. Not good!
 Is anyone here running in this manner with Mimecast and EOP or indeed another security product sat in front of EOP? I'd be interested to hear how your EOP policies are configured, with regards to:
  
Anti-phishing
 Anti-spam
 Enhanced filtering
 Safe Links (Minecast vs EOP - We're using Mimecast, which as I understand is a retrospective check of URLs when a user clicks)
  
Are your users OK with having multiple places to check for quarantined/junk emails? e.g. 1st line product (Mimecast in our case), Microsoft and Junk folder in Outlook.
 Are we attacking this in the wrong way and should be focusing on tightening up Mimecast rather than looking at EOP?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semi rant semi question.
 Anyone else getting fed up with being asked to handle shit outside your scope while also being bugged and blamed for things not going as fast as everyone wants.
 Post COVID I have noticed a ridiculous increase in wait times for everything. Examples
  
Moved our shop to a wireless long range AP solution to share internet with main office (building is close) to cut down on our overall internet costs. AP equipment from CISCO took literally 6 months to get. Pushed back demolition of building near the shop as our Fuel Management Pump System is there and would be cut off from internet before AP installed if we demo'd 
 AC in shop storage room went out. Was asked for some reason to handle it so contacted and scheduled the recommended person boss wanted to use and it's taken them a week to finally come out but shop manager sends me repeated emails on when this is going to get done.
 Anytime I order equipment needed outside the basics it takes a week or even two to arrive. Bosses complain every time saying it should be 2 days tops like everything is Amazon.
 All Vendors I deal with lately whether its security system maintenance or door fixes/AC are behind in work and take days to show up sometimes. Again... bosses whine about it and get aggravated. 
  
Question is, anyone else notice this trend getting worse? Especially an escalation in impatience lately?

 I have made this question roughly a couple of years ago and people have commented that it is still worth pursuing it.
 I want to ask it again today: Do you think that someone should spend their time learning CCIE? I think learning cloud/automation/DevOps is far more relevant nowadays than the CCIE.
 This is excluding Cisco shops of course, where they need certified engineers to hold their status.

 We only need 24 ports (needs to be POE for access points) and will connect back to our core switches via 10GB fiber. 48 would still be fine if cost weren't 2X a 24 port model. It would be going into an IDF cabinet that is in our warehouse, which is full of dust, so it needs to be something that can tolerate the environment.
 I know Arista has been up & coming but I don't know which model(s) would be a good fit.
 What else would you be considering?

 just a quick question as I'm really unsure and maybe somebody could help me out on this one :D
 How would I have to license RDS when using multiple RDS servers where those servers are NOT redundant but rather server A serves use-case A and reaches VLAN A whereas server B is used for a totally different use-case (and another pool of users)?
 Can they both share a single RDS user CAL-pool? Would I have to have multiple RDS CAL pools (and license servers)?
 Or am I totally wrong on everything? :D
 Thanks. Much appreciated :)

 “studying for CCNP - using Cisco training and pass4sure”
 I had a candidate interviewing not long so ago and after reading their resume noticed they listed dump sites as one of their study materials. 
 This person had a ton of certs and had that they were current slated to take another one and had next to it listed that they are studying with pass4sure. 
 Basically “studying for CCNP - using Cisco training and pass4sure”
 I was super interested in interviewing this person mainly to ask wtf but unfortunately HR killed it after everyone brought it up. 
 A few colleagues basically said well if they still know their stuff what does it matter and basically work smarter not harder but obviously in a half joking sort of way. My opinion has always been cheating degrades everyone and worse yet forced those making exams to write worse and worse questions. 
 So would you hire someone that listed this?

 As in the title, we don't know his password, and there is no reset code to use.
 There are no other Mac's available to download MacOS from the store and create install media.
 Is this an expensive boat anchor?

 First off if I need to throw this in one of the other various IT subreddits I will; I figured I’d start here and go elsewhere if need be. 
 I am currently a “Network Administrator”. I was hired into this role shortly after joining my current company after the previous guy left mere months after I joined. The title makes little sense though; we rarely make any networking related changes or overhauls. Most of our environment is plug and play, and I’m not really allowed to make proper changes. (IE our largest location is one giant flat /8 and they don’t want that changing anytime soon). I am angling for a Title change to “Systems Administrator” to better fit the role I’m performing. 
 With that being said, I’m also looking for a compensation increase. While I am compensated fairly…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 ​
 the company I work for sells document management software and recently some of our clients started asking if we have a "customer portal" so they can provide their documents to their end customers. 
 Our DMS solution does not provide this functionality yet, so I am looking to either buy/integrage & adapt a third party solution or build our own. (classic make or buy decision)
 ​
 Now I am currently in the phase to check/analyse what is available out in the wild that we could probably integrate so we don't have to re-invent the wheel. 
 This is why I am asking for your suggestions/recommendations of software/platforms that I might wanna have a look at. 
 ​
 Our clients who use our document management system want to be able to provide a selection of documents via a "portal" to their customers. Their customers might be other businesses or private people. For example a bank that wants to provide the bank statements to their customers via such portal. Or a construction company that wants to provide technical drawings to their contractors. etc. 
 ​
 The basic use case is more or less the same, though the industry varies. 
 ​
 The platform would sit in between the consumer of the documents and our document management system. 
 Most likely the communication between the platform and the DMS should be via REST API's.
 ​
 Do you know of any solution that might cover the basic or advanced requirements of such a "portal" ?
 ​
 I'm also considering building something with the M365 platform (PowerApps, Azure Functions, PowerAutomate, etc.)
 ​
 One of the solutions I'll be looking at will be https://www.deepbox.swiss/en/overview/
 ​
 Any ideas/suggestions are welcome!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently read this thing called "Cyber Signals" - a new publication from Microsoft. These numbers made my skin itch, they seem so cheap! 
 🧑‍💻 Attacker for hire: Prices start at $250 per job 🧑‍💻
 🪲 Ransomware SaaS kit: $40 per month 🪲
 💻 Compromised PC: $0.13-$0.89 💻
 🔑 Stolen Credentials: $150 for 400 million (!!!!) 🔑
 🕵️ Spearphishing for hire: $100-$1000 per successful account 🕵️ 
 So for less than the cost of your weekly shopping, you can buy a Ransomware SaaS kit (now so popular it has it's own name: RaaS). 
 For the price of your council tax, you can buy 400 million stolen credentials. 
 For the price of your energy bill this month, you can hire an attacker. 
 For somewhere around the price of your mortgage or rental payment, you could pay for a successful takeover of a highly targeted, important account within an organisation. 
 I was absolutely floored to learn how low some of these numbers are; especially the Spearphishing one. Okay, you have to know what to do with it afterward.. But even so, it's a crazy world we live in. 
 Remember; You have to defend perfectly every time, an attacker only has to get it right against you once. Protect yourself: do the basics, do them well: 
 🔒 Enable MFA
 💉 Ensure virus definitions are up to date
 ⬆️ Keep endpoints (PC, laptop AND mobile) fully patched
 🚫 Don't give out unnecessary admin privileges
 💾 Back up your data 
 Actioning the above will give you protection from 98% of attacks, say Microsoft.

 I have two servers running keepalived to share a virtual IP
 and haproxy to forward mail traffic to two mail servers using roundrobin. 
 Where i am currently stuck is
 when my IP fails over using keepalive(which works as expected)
 My HAProxy service doesn't restart, so even though the IP fails over the server doesn't work because haproxy is offline so no mail gets passed through.
 How do i ensure the haproxy service gets restarted once teh server picks up the VIP
 Here is my keepalived config
 ​
 global_defs { router_id haproxy02 # The hostname of this host! } vrrp_script haproxy { script "killall -0 haproxy" interval 2 weight 2 } vrrp_instance 50 { virtual_router_id 50 advert_int 1 priority 100 state Master interface eth0 virtual_ipaddress { 192.168.30.145 dev eth0 # The virtual IP address that will be shared betwee MASTER and BACKUP. } track_script { haproxy } } 
 My Backup haproxy has the same config but state is backup and priority is 50

 I can see the standard AD templates on the DCs
 I can see the custom templates on other devices if I add them, just not the DCs
 I've tried adding a single DC on to the permisions for the template restarting the CA and still nothing
 The templates have the following persmions
 Authenticated users - Read

 Domain Controlers - Enroll, Auto Enroll
 Tried settings Enterprise Domain Conrollers to Enroll too but made no difference.
 Has there been some changes to AD that means there's now an extra step for DCs to see templates?

 currently my company has a set of Cisco ASA's in a datacenter for Point to site VPN connectivity. Clients get a static IP address and our routers/firewalls etc are configured to (dis)allow those clients to the backends. So basically, every client can get an ACL list attached to it. 
 But now we are going full into Azure. Since the Azure VPN gateways only give out dynamic IP addresses our current setup can't be transferred to native Azure VPN's. 
 I've seen that Cisco has the CSR 1000V in Azure, but I can't find anything regarding static IP addresses (or pools) in the documentation. So, I'm not sure if this would fix our "issue".
 Does anyone have an idea on this issue? I'd rather not deploy a VPN gateway for each set of users. ;) I'm also not tied to Cisco btw.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 At the request of the boss, I've been implementing PIM this week in time for an MSP switcheroo next week. 
 I'm writing an email to explain how to request roles in response to 'we tried logging in and don't have access' from the new service desk but I'm having a bit of trouble with the test account I've put together to grab screenshots from - 
 ​
 1- Should I need to sign out/in for the role to become active? The PIM page says the page will refresh by itself, you don't need to sign out/in. 
 I've been trying this for the past couple of hours, and I kept having to sign out/in because waiting 3-5 minutes was yielding no change - the 365 admin page and the ECP page were giving a 'no access sucker' unless I signed out/in.
 Meanwhile, after assigning direct access, then unassigning direct access, then trying again using PIM, it now HAS worked without signing out and in again. Is this the usual experience others have had, or have I just been particularly unlucky with propagation delays
 ​
 2- The Exchange recipient administrator role in particular seems bad for this - I assign it and activate it on my test account, but it doesn't seem to do bugger all. I activate it, I sign out, sign in, do a little dance, and still don't have access to the ECP. 
 Meanwhile, I assign it to be permanently active, sign out, sign in, BAM it's immediately there and works flawlessly. 
 ​
 I've signed out and in to these accounts so many times I'm ready to sign out of existence entirely,I just want someone to confirm whether or not this is the experience other people have had or if I'm just having a particularly bad friday night. 
 ​
 I'm gonna go make a cup of tea and cry into it while I wait to see if it's just been me all along

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone
 I'm the systems admin (and CIO) for a small EU company with a centralized IT system hosting data on a windows file server (in a datacenter accessible via VPN). We also have a Google Workspace plan with an account for each employee.
 Each employee has a windows laptop with a VPN client, once the VPN is on the mapped drives on windows explorer are available. Share permissions are managed in AD.
 Everything on the file server is backed up with a 30-day retention scheme on AWS.
 My CEO wishes to switch all data hosting from the file server to shared Google Drives. He feels the data will be more easily accessible this way, but I really have concerns about this - about security mostly, but also data sync on the PCs and disk space, backups, ... I am reluctant about entrusting sensible data to a 3rd party.
 Is there a consensus about doing something like this in the sysadmin world ? I need to establish a lit of pros / cons to help making the decision : either keep everything as is or follow through.
 If I were to go through with this, are there some good practices to follow ? (obviously enabling MFA will be mandatory)
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nestled in a basement office where the carpet likely has not been changed since Elvis breathed his last and the wallpaper since the Cuban missile crisis I work my electronic tasks.
 With no other IT staff on the continent currently I have to manage offices for a international organization to the best of my ability in my remote office.
 Not helped by often confusing and baffling requests from the head office, so elusive the number of times I have been there could be counted on one hand and I would still have a few fingers to lose.
 ​
 One request that came through a while back still eludes me to the reason why and no answers are forthcoming despite my requests.
 Just before a long weekend I am to lockdown the emails of 5 staff members of head office. No reason given. Just told to do so and if they send in tickets or call me, to let them know we are working on it.
 Its not until after the long weekend and several requests by the locked users for help that I am told to unlock them.
 ​
 No reason is given why, only that the masters of the company half a world away want it.
 None of them were fired as far as i know which makes sense (perhaps someone screwed up or was being terminated and we needed to limit access, that is nothing new to me).
 But nothing as far as I know changed and as all the other IT staff are out of contact right now, I would be the one to remove their access.
 ​
 It just leaves me with a uncertainty in my stomach.
 ​
 I am curious if any others have this happen to you. Told to change permissions like this with seemingly no rhyme or reason ?

 It's only one domain account (others are fine), user is long time employee and knows what he is doing.
 User says that they are just doing their work, reading email, saving PDFs and suddenly they can't access any shared drive (because their account was locked).
 Checked Security Logs, there are no events ID: 4740 (Is it possible that login it was disabled?)
 Downloaded Lockout status but Orig Lock only shows the domain computer that locked this account.
 Is it possible to find out what computer/IP request was originated from with wrong account info?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 We had to pull drives from a dell R620 server. There were 6 drives in total that had to be removed from the server. It is believed that 2 are in a RAID 1 for the OS and the remaining 4 in a RAID 5 but it is not confirmed. I won't get into why we couldn't confirm that, it's a long story, but just go with it. 
 The drives were pulled BUT I realize that we did not note down the exact slot each drive came from. We will need to pop them back in further down the road. My initial thought process was the RIAD controller should be smart enough to figure it out, but I am realizing that might not be the case and I may have made a grave mistake.
 Just wondering if there's any insight on whether or not the physical slot matters when it comes time to plug them back in. 
 Thank you very much

 The reg key fix does not fix the problem for any of my team. 
 I only observe reset packets to a domain controller during the rdp request. Removing the October and September CU’s from that DC, resolve the issue seemingly. 
 My problem is that it appears totally random, I will have clients all at the same patch level, remote to the same server using the same dc. It will fail for one client and have no issue with the other. I will reboot the clients and it will start working again. 
 To add more salt to the wounds the OOB fix MS released does piss all for any win10/11 clients & I’m not sure if they even acknowledged the issue right now

 Server: Dell PowerEdge R7525
 OS: ESXi 7.0.3
 Card: Intel E810-XXVDA4
 Switch: QNAP QSW-M5216-1T-US
 ​
 Hello,
 I recently got a new Switch (above model) and the Intel 25Gb card (not directly from Dell) and added it to our R7525 in one of the empty bays.
 The 25Gb connection worked for a few hours, but has yet to work again. It works at 10Gb fine to the above Switch using a non-25Gb (SFP+) cable, but as soon as an SFP28 cable is used to that Switch, it doesn't show a connection on either end (NIC or Switch). However, using a regular SFP+ cable, both work fine. And the SFP28 cable works in a different NIC entirely connecting at 10Gb, so the cables are fine. And the NIC itself is fine, since it works at 10Gb perfectly fine (and once at 25Gb fine (I even took a screenshot to show a coworker we were finally at 25Gb internally)).
 However, I'm at a loss at what could cause it no longer working, especially when neither the NIC or the Switch is showing any sort of connection using SF28 a cable. And ESXi shows the connection as "Down," of course.
 And the server is fairly brand new, so I know it has plenty of PCIe lanes to absorb and plenty of empty PCIe slots to use up since dual-CPU server. I think I tried slot 5 and 7 in the server. It initially worked that one time on slot 5 (I think it was in riser 2?), but stopped after a few hours.
 Multiple cables, multiple manufacturers (10GTek coded for Cisco (initial); Macroreer coded for Intel (last resort)).
 Dell will obviously not assistance since the card is aftermarket, but I have 2 and both are doing the same thing in this same server.
 Link for proof it DID work <once>: https://imgur.com/a/33jBzsH
 Any sort of assistance/direction would be greatly appreciated, as I'm clueless at this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, first of all I'm not a high-level networking engineer, far from it actually, but I know my way around most of the stuff we need to do, and as a lone sysadmin I kind of have to.
 We recently migrated to Nutanix and along with the nodes we got ourselves a pair of new Alcatel OmniSwitch OS6900 TOR switches. Tricky ones to manage, but solid. 
 Our old server rack will be decommissioned but our old TOR switches are not that old at all, they're a pair of HP FlexFabric 5700s. Our core switch, on the other hand, is a VERY old HP 5406zl, with rapidly dying PoE ports and a general feeling that the whole thing is going to die soon as well. Switches are still hard to find, so getting new ones would take at least 6 to 10 months. 
 So, in the meantime, I'm thinking about replacing the 5400 with the 5700.
 Now, when I say "core" switch I do not actually mean it, it's by all intents and purposes an access switch: no l3, no gateway, no nothing. All routing is done through the firewall. All it has connected to it are clients, and a trunk to the TOR switches.
 We would not hit any of the limitations of the 5700 (i.e. the 1024 entry arp-table) but we would gain a healthy new switch.
 Yet, since I constantly doubt myself, I'm asking Reddit: am I missing something here?

 Today our company hosted a Town Hall in Teams, and we had some serious issues that our CEO was pissed about.
 Background: Users were mostly on wired internal network, and using the Desktop Teams app.
 Had over 100 people in the call and we were recording it.
 1). Anyone with a webcam on was extremely laggy and glitchy, but audio was fine.
 2). Screen Sharing a video would not show for users in the call, they could only see a grey square.
 Had no issues when I joined on my phone and even the recording was fine. It's when we were live that we had issues.
 Any solutions to this, I saw disabling GPU hardware acceleration helped, but I can't find a way to disable it for all users.

Some TCP implementation use selective acknowledgements (SACKs) to provide explicit feedback about the segments that have been received. This greatly improves TCP's ability to retransmit the right segments.
  
but it doesn't say how common that both sides support this is. Is it like 50% of all tcp connections? 90%? 10%?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years ago we implemented a solution working with a Cisco guy who has now gone on to other jobs. I have maintained the solution with a very basic level of Cisco knowledge he passed on. We are looking at replacing the devices before we face an outage and are scrambling. We are trying to find a more user-friendly solution that still does the job and thus I seek advice.
 Currently, we have two Cisco 1811 in a data center. Our needs are fairly simple and I have been told in the past we can replace both with a single device these days. We have an Incoming device that has VPNs to the providers and contains all the traffic from field devices. That is connected to the second outgoing CISCO directly and then routes traffic via VPN to various clients based on which devices are theirs.
 Traffic to the internet is restricted with a few exceptions, some IP based, some port-based.
 What replacement device would best meet my needs? Preferably something with a GUI interface instead of the CISCO command lines. 
 *edit to add some details*
 My concerns are really just about the two routers into one or needing two.
 At present, I have some IP routes for each client VPN, like below.
 ip route 10.232.0.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2
 ip route 10.232.24.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2
 ip route 10.232.32.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2
 I also have to NAT everything from one provider's VPN to the client VPN.
 ip nat inside source static 10.232.128.200 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
 I don't really care about the brand, just function and something a bit more user-friendly for a fairly entry-level of networking knowledge.

 All the options for configuring the VC in central went away. I asked my rep about it, and got this statement back:
 I'm afraid "Virtual Mobility Gateways" are not supported yet. Right now, the only thing we have is "Virtual VPNCs", which you can run in Azure, AWS, Google and ESXi. 
 So before you blindly upgrade central connected IAPs in a VC setup, take heed.

 ​
 How can it be so bad after so many years this protocol has been out?! Not only can the authentication options be changed only in the who knows how many years old control panel settings and not the modern settings app, but once you finish setting up the network, you can no longer modify some of the key attributes like which CA certificates to validate the radius server against!
 ​
 What. The. Hell. Microsoft.
 ​
 I swear, I don't usually get my jimmies rustled at work, but this... This just bloody infuriated me!
 ​
 And that's not the end of it, either!
 Once you finally figure out how to configure the authentication details... Unless you remembered to change one tiny little option in the PEAP configuration, if someone was to impersonate an AP, even if they present a completely different and invalid server certificate, windows just displays a puny little dialog going something like "Do you expect this network to be present here?" along with a hyperlink option to display the radius certificate, and a pair of buttons - Connect / Cancel.
 ​
 No huge warning like in web browsers, if a page presents an invalid SSL cert, noooo. No 3-dialogs-deep exception confirmation option or secret keyboard phrases. 
 ​
 A simple. Yes. No. 
 ​
 Am I missing something here, or would that take away all the benefits the Enterprise version of WPA2 has?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I had a Cisco AP (3802i) swapped out for an Extreme Networks one (AP250) trying to test something. Got the Extreme AP connected and it connected back to XIQ fine. AP reported that there were several clients connected to it and I figured everything was fine. Turns out things were not fine as the clients (primarily iPads) now consistently disconnect from wireless. Some flat out drop off Wifi and say "Cannot connect to X network" or that they can't connect to the Internet and other times they appear to be working but with low signal strength. I think they're going from the Extreme AP to a Cisco one that's in another room across the hall from where the Extreme AP which is really odd since that Cisco AP appears to have really weak signal going into that room. 
 ​
 The same SSIDs are configured on both Cisco and Extreme with the same VLANs being attributed to both. We use the same model of Extreme Network APs in another building and they work fine. My guess is that the clients keep trying to connect to the Cisco AP instead of the Extreme but I'm not understanding why when the Extreme AP should have better signal strength vs the Cisco one. I know mixing APs from different manufacturers isn't really ideal but this was the only room where we made this kind of swap.

 See below for error from error log:
 The system is entering sleep.
 Sleep reason application API
 Source: kernel-power
 Event ID 42
 Any advice would be appreciated. Even downloaded software “don’t sleep” and disabled sleep but it still does it.
 Edit
 It used to happen a lot more frequently, we thought it could be the cheap adapters we had. Replacing them helped a lot, but still sleeps occasionally but always seems to be very shortly after booting.

For example, let's say you have 100 Windows Servers and 10 Windows 10 clients and you have been tasked with installing a brand new backup solution that backs up files and folders via backup agents. You are creating the new backup job, and you have to decide which servers/clients get agents installed, and which server/client disks/folders you want to select as part of your backup jobs. Does IT just make an educated guess at what needs to be backed up? Does the business unit provide IT with a list of data sources (structured and unstructured) and IT works off of that? 
 In our shop, IT decides what should be selected for backup on a daily basis knowing where actual company data lives. If it can't be recreated elsewhere, we back it up. If there is another source of that same data (and its current, then we skip it). For example, we do backup our home and shared folders, but we don't back up application installation folders.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All, 
 I have just started a new gig working in a 99% Terminal Services Environment with the vast majority of users working off Windows 7/10 HP Thin Clients connecting via RDS to Windows Server 2016. 
 Users are logging into Thin Clients with Generic Auto Logins and then authenticate via RDC to their sessions. This is problematic for new users because you can't change your password from RDC, at least not without making the process overly complicated by disabling NLA Server Side and a convoluted process client side with first tie logins using a secondary RDC shortcut with CredSSP disabled.
 I haven't worked in a shop that has had this problem, formally I was the IT manager for a mid size org and our TS were connected to from Windows workstations so users were already authenticated.
 The IT Manager's process has been to assign users passwords in the past and set them to not expire. Then he would communicate the password to the user or manager for login. Obviously this is 1. Not Secure, 2. Cumbersome as hell. 3. Several points of failure. 
 This has been made more ridiculous by the fact that about 6 months ago they brought an MSP onboard who is now handling "some" of the user onboarding process including creation of AD accounts and they use a temp password as they should. But, now new users can't login. And my understanding is that new users have just been hijacking others accounts to get to sessions, creating security issues, profiles issues etc. 
 My understanding is that the RDP Web Portal will resolve this issue, but I am honestly not familiar with using it and wanted to see if anyone had any input before I go suggesting this as the solution to the org. 
 My understanding is that Users would connect to the RDP Web Portal via a browser where they would authenticate for the first time and be able to reset their passwords, and from there they would have access to their Terminal Services Sessions, is this accurate?

These four guys work the best bankers hours in the business but if I need something pressing over outside of their time which happens maybe 5 times a year, 3 will never pick up the phone and will respond to my text hours later and the other one simply doesn’t acknowledge it all. The one guy who is getting promoted is super reliable and will not only answer my call but is happy to jump in if needed. Do people really think the are going to get a raise and promotion just because they show up and do their job? What ever happened to going above and beyond? These guys are going to be in for a shock especially with inflation and realize with their small bump, it’s actually going to be a pay cut in the long run.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the most part, Win 11 is pretty much the same, but there's a few things I wanted to find out before continuing, particularly because the vast majority of our staff do not work from the office anymore.
  
While we're still on Windows 10, I wanted to explore any/all new Group Policies for Windows 11. How do I correctly add the Win11's C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions files to our SYSVOL without breaking Win10? Or are new PolicyDefinitions backwards compatible (ie all old settings are in new templates, so will still apply)? I've updated the policy templates in the past but only within the same OS - is it just the same procedure?
 
I think I read somewhere that Win11 is no longer supported by MDT as they're pushing for InTune. I haven't messed around with this yet, but is this true? We don't use 365 (Google Workspace unfortunately) so having to subscribe/set up InTune would be an extra cost/delay to this whole thing.
 
If you've upgraded your domain to Win 11, how did you do this? Did you use WSUS to deploy the upgrade or did you recall the hardware to do it in person? I know the cleanest way is formatting but let's assume that that's just not an option for us.
 
Did your staff adjust/like the change to the center start menu/icons or do you/did you just take it back to the bottom left?

 I'm a Senior IT Tech at a rural ISP who's just come in to replace a 3rd party support.
 One of the (many) issues I have is we have a handful of Linux users of which I've never managed from a sys admin view before (used Linux in personal life etc.).
 The issues i have are; 
 ​
  
They all want to use different distros
 don't want to be managed via saas solutions
 want local admin on their devices
 they were given windows devices but 3rd party support to which they wiped and installed their flavour of Linux.
 CTO wants them to run Windows with linux in a Virtual box VM ( i dont think this is workable)
  
​
 My current thinking is, for them to all run the same flavour of Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 or 20.04 LTS) as these are both supported by Intune (in its infancy atm but hoping to get more control over the coming months) with AdminByRequest which i'm currently trailing with some windows users.
 I know no matter what i do i'm going to have an uphill battle as currently they have free roam of their devices as they're basically personal devices at this stage! But from a sys admin and security viewpoint this is a huge no go! I want them to have the best experience to do their job as they can but there has to be a line where they are formatting devices! I know if i dont approach this right they will just format it again. Currently in the progress of writing a laptop policy for staff to sign also to stop them doing certain things without a slap on the wrists!
 Open to any other ideas or advice!

 ​
 I am stragling with setup WHfB on some computers in company. The hybrid key trust configuration is completed and basically it works flawless on all laptops. Though, on some desktops users cannot setup PIN due to error saying that this device do not meet WHfB requirements.
 Fun part is that if any other use sign-in to that desktops with his account, then the issue not exist anymore and they can set their PINs. So, despite of what the error says, I think it is some issue with specific users profile. I believe they tried setup Windows hello before the configuration was ready so something might be mixing here now. I tried to delete NGC folder, but that did not help.
 Is there any way to completely purge WHfB settings of user, other than complete deletion of his profile?

 I'm currently troubleshooting an issue with our 2 on premise Domain Controllers,
 +6000 event 521 are generated every hour (Status code 0x80000005)
 From what I can gather, the issue could be that "LSA Queue" is full, because Audit events are generated faster than what can be processed. ( windows - Event ID 521 - Critical Logging Failure on Domain Controllers - Server Fault )
 Now, enabling the LSA event log, shows a lot of Event ID300's containing "Groups assigned to a new logon." and then the device/user and the groups assigned. Which to me seems of no value logging wise.
 ​
 Has anyone here dealt with that type of problem?
 Right now I'm looking into either increasing the LSA Queue, og maybe limit/remove that particular audit event.

 I thought that all serial cables are the same eventual I found out that there are ; - Crossover or "Null Modem" - Straight Through Serial Cable
 My question is all crossover cables are Null modem?
 From the oracle documents the connection is required to have this pin out.
 Pin 3 --> Receive Data Pin 4 --> Transit Data Pin 6 --> GND 
 I have found on superuser web page that I could use RS232 Null Modem Cable DB9F to DB9M which I bought from Amazon.
 Is this cable allright? Did anyone used this type of connection before?
 Are there any SSH terminals that could change the serial PIN out?
 Any help would be appreciated.
 BTW my laptop doesn't have a serial connection, so USB 2.0 is my only option.

 ​
 Just wondering if anyone's supporting Huawei devices that have suddenly started prompting users for having the wrong username/password in the past couple days.
 Have had a few staff in China with BYOD phones (P40's) not able to get their work emails anymore using the default built in mail app. I don't have such a device myself to test with unfortunately - only an old pre-trade war Nova 3i.
 Re-entering passwords hasn't helped, re-creating the account hasn't worked.
 Edit - Azure sign in logs show no failures, Disabling MFA doesn't help, google has no suggestions, Huawei website lacks info and the Huawei subreddit has no posts complaining about this either, so wondering if it's a Microsoft change or what?
 Outlook app proper seems to work, but it seems the default one has better contacts integration, like how Apple's mail app is the only one that works for their contacts.
 ​
 Anyone else? Ta :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 we're trying to rollout some yubikeys to our colleagues and my boss wants to "force" usage as smart cards for windows 10 (ie: GPO Interactive Logon: force smart card or windows hello). This leaves us with a bunch of problems:
  
we have to use admin yubikeys to elevate local demands
 remote support has to have a passthrough functionality (currently talking with teamviewer here)
  
So my question is, do you guys know any middleware that allows a bit finer tuning of windows logon instead of goin all in with that GPO? I heard about SCInterface or DUO. Any experience with this kind of software? Is it even possible?
 Regards.

 I am little confused about DAC and Fiber usage. It looks like DAC is cheaper. Is there any difference between them functionality wise? I have to connect FW to my Switch with 10G links and they are racked up close to each other. Which one I should use for better performance?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fellow SysAdmin was making 80K salaried, but working 60 hour weeks, easily. Typically 5-7am to 5-7pm. Not to mention after hours when on call. That is actually less per hour than average Tier 1 Help Desk technicians make here (~$22/hr), if they work 60 hour weeks with overtime past the 40 hour mark (1.5x). Not to mention, $22 is starting rate.
 40*22*52+20*33*52 = 80,080 > 80,000
 Basically if a Help Desk worker put in 60 hour weeks, they would be above SysAdmin for annual income, even if both were doing the same (60 hours). And Help Desk would be not needing to be on call at all. The only thing stopping this, is Help Desk managers restricting total weekly hours techs can work (in theory). I know this is part of why companies have salaried workers in the first place, but it's still wild to think many SysAdmins are making such a low effective rate per hour.

 I work in a team of 5 (manager and 3 other network admins). There's kinda no direction or vision, feel like there's barely any management from our manager (apart from a "you doing OK?" every few days). We've just got a few projects we're each working on, but other than that there's really no visibility into what's going on.
 Everyone works from home, so it's hard to feel like I'm even working in a team to be honest.
 Does anyone else experience this? Is it normal?

Now if you are getting fragmentation then you should lower the mtu. But the thing is fragmentation occurs when you need to split the packet into multiple in order to not go above 1500. So why would you lower the mtu to 1400 in that case it doesn't make sense.

 I want to put a simple web server machine listening on some random port (65000 for example) and be able to do the following:
  
traffic initiated from internet to 33.33.33.33:65000
 vm-instance (ubuntu os) should take this internet traffic, change the dest ip to 192.168.1.2:65000
 send traffic to router and router will forward it to the web server
  
My questions are: is this possible? and what nat/ip table commands would I apply on the vm-instance?
 ​

 note: The server can access the internet because I enabled ip forwarding and applied a NAT rule on the vm-instance (server > router > mgmt cloud > internet)

 So a while back I, solo IT at my company, was asked to restructure the manufacturing processes in our companies manufacturing planning system (see original post for full story). As many pointed out, this fell entirely in the realm of industrial engineering.
 A few days ago I made the company an offer. I would help restructure their processes with the help of 3rd party consultants, but I will not work IT at the same time. So they'd have to choose what full time position they want me to be in.
 After consideration they decided today that they wanted me to work full time on reimplementing their manufacturing processes and it would be very clear to the rest of the company that I am no longer IT and should not be approached regarding regarding any IT issue moving forward. This will take effect in 1-2 weeks.
 I then asked, so how will IT be handled when I'm moved off? How will we hire someone in time to learn and manage all the IT processes? They said that end-users will have to step up their game and figure out how to troubleshoot their own issues.
 I'm very excited. Not only do I get to tell end users "not my problem anymore" when the inevitable storm hits from IT being torn away, Im also betting they last no more than 2 weeks tops before they pull me off engineering and beg me to get back to handling IT. We'll see how that conversation goes 😉

 Fast forward to now, I woke up the other day with fever and real bad sore throat. I sent an email to my boss saying I wasn't going to be in and he was totally fine with it. I still felt guilty, and tried coming in today since I felt a lot better, but everyone at work was just like "nah go home, we don't want to catch whatever you had", even when I went to tell my boss I was going home, he was totally cool with me taking today off as well.

 I've been searching all over the place and I seem to be looking for a specific traffic generator.
 I'm wanting to test SSL decryption performance on two vendor firewalls at our DR site, with a need to generate x number of stateful SSL connections to say, example.com over time to simulate user traffic at our HQ.
 I looked at packet sender, but the packets always fall into the "Do not decrypt" bucket and don't seem to tax the FW.
 Any thoughts or suggestions? TIA

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 These days servers doesn't have RS232 connection. To connect to network device console interface (for example Cisco NCS-5501-SE) I'm trying to use some kind of '4world' USB to RS232 serial converter. And seems it works very buggy... the typing is slow and the letters are 'thrown out'. Almost impossible even to login. So i'm wondering if there're any additional command to make USB-to-RS232 serial converter work better ? Because without converter it works OK"
 To connect without adapter i'm using this command - and everything is OK:
 screen /dev/ttyS0 115200 cs8,-parenb,-cstopb,-hupcl 
 When changing connection to USB adapter mode - same settings, i just change the device naming to USB0:
 screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 cs8,-parenb,-cstopb,-hupcl 
 and the shit starts to hit the fan.
 I'm wondering if it's the adapter fault, some additional settings should apply ? Or the USB-to-Serial adapter suppose to work badly ? 
 Thanks

At implementation time neither vendor would take responsibility for the integration. What they meant from the start is that it's possible to use ETL to connect the two. I had to build it. Now it's my baby and any time there's a problem with it, I have to fix it. I've got a baker's dozen babies at this point. Got an email from a manager the other day asking me to show him how to troubleshoot the solution that his department needs so that he doesn't have to wait for me to be free to fix it. I was seconds away from suggesting that he could prevent the problems proactively by hiring competent people who wouldn't fuck it up in the first place. I don't know where I'm going with this. It's just a pointless rant. The real solution is that I need to train my tiny little team on all these solutions so that we can support them as a team. I'm just afraid that once I let them loose on my environment, they'll just become another userbase that I constantly have to support.

Our Internal CA has generated a new cert but we're not able to add it back in as the Intermediate CA that signed the cert has renewed its cert 6 months ago. Thus the newly generated cert is not accepted as the trusted CA on the PAN has a different serial number (old one) to the one that signed new CSR. 
 As it stands, we will have to replace the Trusted Cert (the intermediate Win Server) with the new one. Then apply the new Cert to all the other PSNs, This means we'd have a total outage across our estate. 
  
Is there another way to replace the expired cert without doing all of them, Our Windows team have advised they will not be able to sign/generate a cert with the old intermediate CA. 
 Also while we do this, how do we ensure the pre-authorised machines will not have any issues? (we have authentication open on the port as well a "authentication event no-response action authorize vlan" but this will drop the traffic into a guest vlan.

 At my workplace we have a SCCM server which does have WSUS enabled on it, and we just got a couple of new Win 11 machines and there were a couple of issues we are experiencing with them being able to update from the Windows Updates section in Settings.
 After a machine joins the domain it will install the SCCM client and once the client is installed it removes the "Check online for updates from Microsoft Update" in Windows Updates. I know there are some registry entries you can change or delete to get it working but I was wondering has anyone been able to get that back wither it was from Group Policy or another method? Or if anyone else has dealt with the same issue they has a resolution to it? Thanks in advance!

 I have been working non stop since July while the executives pat each other on the backs and congratulate each other on all the growth they've had. Including myself I have a team of 3. They have went from 300 people last year to 800 this year. Two helpdesk and me the "IT manager". Or should I say field tech/sysadmin/network engineer/helpdesk Tier 2/security.
 They have opened up 3 new branches and bought one company. They gave one week lead times for each to be set up. They have me traveling and staying overnight all over the state for these. They now want a network overhaul by thanksgiving for cyber insurance purposes and a new time keep software customized, tested, trained, and deployed before December. I'm working through nights days and weekends.
 Maybe I'm just not cut out for IT management. I've started having heart palpitations. I'm terrified every time my phone dings. I daydream every time I drive to work on crashing just to get a short break in the hospital. My temper and anxiety are 0 to 100 at the smallest problem. Maybe I should be a potato farmer.
 I was getting paid $50,000 a year at the beginning of the year. I've been in this position for 4 years. I demanded more money and they bumped me to $70,000 and promise to double my bonus making it 10 grand at the end of November.
 I'm trying to just get everything they want done and hang on to get my bonus. Then push my guilt down enough to dip. I miss my family.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I enabled 2FA for all users via a conditional access policy. Majority had 2FA enforced anyway, including our admin account used for AD Connect.
 We're now receiving errors with our Azure AD Connect sync - specifically:
 "Due to a configuration change made by your administrator, or because you moved to a new location, you must enroll in multi-factor authentication to access".
 When I check the sign-in logs for that account I can see that it's suggested that the MFA claim isn't being satisfied which is required because of the CA policy enforced.
 However, that's not the case because we have 2FA enforced and when going through the Azure AD Connect sync process, I'm entering the 2FA code we have in our 2FA app, which is accepted.
 We're also able to log into the admin portal with the same account while satisfying the 2FA requirements.
 I've disabled 2FA on the account and re-enabled it, but this has made no difference. We also don't have security defaults enabled.
 The user is also not part of risky users or risky sign-ins.
 Has anyone come across this before?

 CSV files
 Excel files

 Data validation and structure (This is very important)

We have had issues after installing the October updates on our DC's. The issue seemed to prevent cross-site kerberos authentication over RDP for us. We'd see an event ID 4769 with the error code of 0x14(TGT was revoked). It failed until we uninstalled almost every update from October. Below is the event, the account name section was always empty.
 Is there something I have missed with these updates that would cause this? I feel if the issue was present for everyone it'd be a lot bigger deal and I'd see more information. However, I have seen no mention of issues for anyone else.
 A Kerberos service ticket was requested.

 In our company we have two use cases for sending mails to a larger audience
  
Multiple times a year, we want to inform part of our customers (or all) of increasing prices for our products. Recipient count around 1000-1500.
 Marketing wants to inform customers of upcoming trade fairs
  
I have just now learned about different email marketing software and that there is a difference between a marketing mail and a transactional mail. I am under the assumption that for use case 1) we should not use our own mail server since the high amount of mails might put us on a blacklist - is this correct?
 If yes and we need an external tool for this, would use case 1) count as a transactional mail? All recipients come from our CRM system and had direct contact to Sales at some point in the past.
 For use case 2) I'm pretty sure this counts as a marketing mail and requires recipients to opt-in first. This is fine for use case 2) but would not make much sense for use case 1) as getting all of our customers to sign up for price increase mails is unrealistic.
 I would appreciate some further input to guide me in the right direction. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I've been noticing recently that some new HP computers run a bios firmware upgrade during their deployment (using MDT). During the deployment, I install a recent cumulative update which I downloaded from the microsoft catalog. This is a rudimentary way to have a windows deployment up to date when delivering it. After deployment, the sccm update system kicks in.
 The process of Bios firmware updates coming with Windows updates is detailed here:
 https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c07009542
 Strangely, I've never seen these bios firmware updates happen with updates pushed to clients over SCCM, even though the cumulative updates should be the same.
 Is anyone aware of a difference between cumulative updates pushed with SCCM and cumulative updates downloaded from the catalog, or of another process which might block bios firmware upgrades during the regular monthly update cycle?
 I don't necessarily dislike the update process over wsus if it takes care of bios passwords and bitlocker lockouts (which it seems to do) but I'd rather schedule it and inform the users if it would come in the regular monthly update cycle.
 The settings titled “Prompt for Admin authentication on Capsule Update” controls the password requirement for use with BIOS updates via UEFI Capsule. The default value is “Disable,” which does not require a password for this flash mechanism.

We use GoToTraining for the classroom meeting. And finally we use Logical Operations for the courseware book & materials. 
 This has worked ok, but it's a bit clunky giving the students 3 different things to log into. Especially for our more novice ones, it can be a hassle. Does anyone know of an off-the-shelf learning system that we could use to combine these things?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're going to shortly refresh our fleet of remote laptops by resetting Windows, configuring them with Autopilot and enrolling them with Intune for management. We currently deploy devices with MDT and are able to specify that the drive is Bitlocker encrypted with the requirement to unlock being that the TPM is present and the user uses a PIN. It doesn't appear that this is possible with Autopilot - there's no built in mechanism during the Autopilot process to prompt a user to enter a pin that would then need to be used to unlock the drive when they power it on. Has anyone found a way to achieve this?
 This has raised the question whether the additional protection of a PIN (alongside the TPM) is necessary to secure our remote devices. If we BitLocker our drives using the TPM only as the requirement to unlock it then the data on it is protected if the drive is removed and plugged in to another machine. Additionally, if the device is lost/stolen then the user will need Windows credentials to log in to the laptop and access the data on it. If we couldn't find a way to dynamically add a pin to our remote devices, are there any things I'm missing by using this as a secure solution? 
 We want our data to be secure on our remote devices and up until now BitLocker with a TPM and a Pin has been how we achieve that. I guess my question is whether our data on remote devices is still considered to be secure (in the eyes of the industry and best practice) if we encrypt our drives using TPM only as the mechanism to unlock it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Recently i was asked to configure DMARC in our company.
 I see that we have a lot of SPF allignment issues (25% fail (Some of them are permerrors because we have 14 lookups and no spf flattening). But the biggest allignment issue is with outlook.com. This is weird because we have: include:spf.protection.outlook.com in our SPF record, also the Outlook ones are NOT permerrors.
 Some examples of the microsoft domains that the envelopes are from:
 eur05-vi1-obe.outbound.protection.outlook.com
 eur05-db8-obe.outbound.protection.outlook.com
 eur04-he1-obe.outbound.protection.outlook.com
 Did anybody have the same issue or know what the solution might be?

 Right now I am in a pickle and I need to figure out the best way to get tons of testing results from production lines, index them, and share them with our biggest customer. Problem is that I kinda have 2 days to do it. 
 O was thinking about a solution: Shared Drives > Power Gateway > Flow > Power Automate > Sharepoint > Index > Azure Guest account and be done with it. 
 Problem is that I do not have a Power license and I can't get one that quickly. So now I need to replace Gateway with syncing on-prem to OneDrive and then run copy flow and everything cloud only. 
 What do you think? Install OneDrive on FS and manually put local folders to sync or create a VM, map the drives and run sync outside the FS? Or maybe a third solution? I am afraid that changing folders to Sync mode can f*up the NTFS rights, paths, dedup, or anything else. 
 Thank you in advance!

 Edit: I didn't realize this but I guess Montana(the state I live in) is one of the few states that isn't an "at-will" state so if companies don't have a probationary period (6mo-1yr) they have to actually provide a reason to fire someone, they can't just fire people without cause.

 i have next year my exam and i need a project.
 One of my ideas was that I could integrate a software to monitor our Switches.
 If a device it connected to a switch, then I want to see the following things: MAC-Address, IP-Address, VLAN-Tag and the Device name.
 My idea is that with the Software installed on a Raspberry PI I put one in every patch room. So that it automatically reads the port and I just need to enter the room.
 Maybe a web gui to see it from my office.
  
 Is there a Software you use? Or ideas you have to this?
 For my exam programming is not so necessary because its not the main part of my training for the Job. 
 So I hope there is a software I can use.
 Kind regards
 Lennart

 Long story short, insurance company wants us to up our password policy...fine
 Old admins used the default domain policy...this policy had a lax policy.....
 To ease users into things we created a temp policy and applied it to the MyOrgUsers OU. THe gpo was enforced and place on the top of the link order. However the default domain policy keeps winning despite it not being enforced.
 TLDR....Default Domain Policy that is not ENFORCED is winning and not letting our custom password policy apply settings. Also I changed the default domain policy password to not defined and that did not work. 
 Have to say in 15 years....this is a first for me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[OK, first of all, I am still considering this and not sure if I should do it. I am looking for advise if this is feasible at all
 I am a IT professional, but mostly datacenter oriented. I did build some wireless networks; based on UBNT hardware (usually up to 100 people).
 In my free time, I help out NGO's and like wise organization with my expertise. One of those NGOs is organizing a small conference (200-300 people) and have a desire to have a seperated WiFi network and not use the hotel network (1. because hotel networks are not always stable, 2. security is not always up to par/sometimes shared with other guests)
 I am now designing a potential network to see if this project is feasible, as tell them if I can do it or not.
 I am considering UBNT, as I know the software/hardware and it is easy to configure for me. Its a temporary network, so speedy deployment is important, using UBNT will help with that.
 Below is my initial plan and looking for feedback if this will produce a stable enough network: 
 There are two floors in play here (F1 & F3, F2 is not used/not part of this) 
 Floor 1
 - Room 1: 64m2/20 people, 1 AP
 - Room 2: 64m2/20 people, 1 AP
 - Room 3: 128m2/40 people, 1 AP
 - Attrium, 1600m2, 300 people, 6 AP 
 Floor 3
 - 4 rooms of each ~100m2/50 people, 1 AP each 
 Total: 13 APs, probably order a few extra to fill in potential gaps. Probably will we rent the equipment. 
 People have one or two devices, so I probably need a /22. Disable client-to-client communication, to limit broadcasts/ARP-traffic on the network. Alternative would be to split it in smaller subnets, but people will roam around, so I think that is not convenient. 
 Build up time, 1-2 days. It will be running a lot of wires.... 
 Looking forward to read that I am crazy to consider this. ;-)

 Someone offhandedly mentioned here that you could order dedicated Att business fiber in order for them help with the cost of running line/build out (they offer 10k budget) then switching to a significantly cheaper shared business fiber plan once the circuit was in place, is that really a thing? I looked at the early termination fee for business fiber and it mentions that, "The ETF is calculated at $25 x the number of months remaining in the term." Normally the dedicated plans run 24 month terms, so eat a $575 fee (23 months) then switch to a cheaper plan seems more economical as long as you don't need the SLA and Att would recoup their cost but just on a longer time period. 
  
 Currently, the building already has a Att fiber trunk in the MPOE, but were somehow too cheap to run a handoff to each unit. The previous tech confirmed they have tagged and turned on a port for us on their equipment like so but we have no conduit or straight line running from MPOE to our unit. So the buildout cost would be to just run conduit and line to the unit as the main trunk is already in place. Just not really sure if dedicated circuit can be repurposed for shared later on with a setup like ours.

 I hope you are feeling great and have a nice and quiet day.
 Let´s get to the topic: Many of my users (including myself) have noticed a horrible decrease of performance for the whole system, as soon as one starts to share his/her screen on a Teams meeting.
 Everything takes way longer to open up and the whole system starts to feel some kind of unstable. Everything you click on has a high latency.
 We have allready checked the performance monitor on the computers. The only thing that was noticable was that Teams consumpts arround 15 - 30 percent of CPU usage (for a 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 as an example). Neither the SSD, GPU, RAM or other components seem to have a higher workload. It´s just the CPU, but anyway it´s by far not at 100% workload.
 I googled arround and found out that this problem seems to be well known for many people but nobody seems to have a solution for it.
 ​
 Does anyone else encounter the same behaviour of Teams or maybe even have a few hints for us or a solution for the problem?
 ​
 Thank you in advance!
 ​
 ​
 Edit// I forgot to mention that all of our computers at least have a 10th or 11th gen i7 with 16GB RAM and a m.2 ssd.

 Just wanted to ask. Anyone go for Microsoft's Cybersecurity Architect exam? I've done all prereqs in preparation. Passed SC-200, SC-300, AZ-500 and MS-500. MS-500 probably was the hardest IHMO.
 What should I expect in SC-100, since it's a fairly new exam.

 Trying to get a rough time estimate for how long it takes to manage 7 esxi/VMware hosts with 35 total VMs (combination of windows and Linux) on them.
 We don't need to actually manage the operating system of the VMs, just storage/ram/CPU and networking.
 The things I wondering about are how many hours a week it takes to manage: 1. Updating esxi hosts (new esxi firmware and os) 2. Updating esxi configuration 3. Updating OSVM configurations 4. Securing and preparing for security evaluation for esxi/VMware.
 Just ball park numbers or how many people you have working on that level of infrastructure.
 Edit: for people asking ... I am an admin. Management is telling me I need take over a new vsphere cluster. I am telling them that it's a lot of work on top of the admin work I am already doing.

 How does L3 VNI learns the Host IP Addresses and IP Prefixes available on Local VTEP and also from Remote VTEP?
 For Remote Learning, i learnt that the VTEP learns Host MAC Addresses from Remote VTEPs through MP-BGP EVPN Type-2 route advertisements. Is the same Type-2 EVPN Route Advertisement used to exchange Host IP Addresses and IP Prefixes?
 What is the purpose of EVPN Type5 Route advertisements?

 While studying TCP Congestion Control, i came to know that Sender starts with Slow Start phase where it starts sending some amount of Send MSS and upon receiving acknowledgement, the sender increases the Congestion Window.
 Some Articles say that the sender adds one more MSS to Congestion Window and some say doubles it doubles up the Congestion Window. Which one is true?
 Also, when the Congestion Window reaches the Slow Start Threshold or some Packet Loss is detected, the Sender ends the Slow Start Phase and moves into Congestion Avoidance Phase.
 Can anyone clarify how is the Slow Start Threshold Value calculated? Is it a configurable option in OS Kernel or Registry settings?

A brand new ask is for contractors with non AD machines to be able to authenticate. Trying to figure out if the following is possible or a pipe dream.
 Contractors hit the guest network (default gateway is our Palo Alto firewall which handles all security and routing for guest). Redirect to ISE, log in with AD creds. Traffic then hits the Palo (since it's the gateway) and the Palo then assigns access based on the AD account used in the ISE portal.
 So... 1. Capwap to controller cwa to ise 2. Login ad to use portal 3. Ise passes user info to Palo which then tags secpols by user name

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I am running into a brick wall here with our DMVPN configuration that was originally setup by people long gone from the company. From what I'm seeing we have a traditional hub n spoke configuration with BGP as the dynamic routing protocol. On all of our spoke routers I can see two NHRP NHS's Output below (The old ISP public WAN IP that needs to be replaced with our new ISP public IP & and the 2nd that should stay). I am having an issue with where to go to re-configure this first NHRP NHS NBMA address.
 10.XXX.XXX.3 E NBMA Address: XX.XX.XX.XX priority = 0 cluster = 0
 10.XXX.XXX.4 RE NBMA Address: XX.XX.XX.XX priority = 0 cluster = 0
 I can see the locally connected route from the hub to the 10.XXX.XXX.4 in this case, but not the .3
 ​
 How do all spokes know about an NBMA address not being advertised by the hub? Does a brand new tunnel need to be created on the hub with the new public IP?
 Note - There is a switch connecting the 2 WAN IPs to the hub router.
 For whatever reason a 'Show IP NHRP NHS' command on the hub shows me nothing.
 I also named this post dual isp redundancy and not dual hub. I'm hoping I don't have to create a new hub.

 We are looking at replacing our current Wifi environment (Ruckus) spread over about 6-10 buildings/sites with something newer. I am curious about the pros and cons of various modern systems (ruckus, meraki, cisco, ubiquity, aruba, juniper, extreme etc) and what fellow network admins have experienced in recent years. What do you like and dislike about a particular product, what should we look out for, etc? 
 I would like this new build to let us take a wifi first approach, so I'd like something rock solid, good performance and security, and hopefully somewhat affordable. We currently have 1gbps PoE switches, but once their lifecycle is up we could certainly get 2.5 or 5gbps ports to support future growth.

 For the BGP process I thought I could only activate the l2vpn family because I need to distribute just MAC addresses, no IPV4 routes. On Huawei S5700 switches it seems that if the ipv4 family is not active everything stops working though. I thought I may generalize and just say "activate the family you need and nothing else"; if you need not IPv4 then shut it down.
 Is really like I descrived above or is there an explanation for that? Or might it a bug of the OS on the S5700? 
 TIA,

 Setup is as follows: users can connect to a Wi-Fi as guests through a captive portal and after that connect to the VPN if they need to take their PC away from their table and cable. Works fine, but people moan about logging in twice to get to work. I would say it's not that big of a deal, but if I can help someone out, why not?
 On our vWLC I've set up a pre-auth ACL allowing connections to our VPN endpoint. While I get hits on it, AnyConnect gives out a message:
  
The service provider in your current location is restricting access to the Internet. You need to log on with the service provider before you can establish a VPN session. You can try this by visiting any website with your browser.
  
Fine, I must've forgotten to add something that's also needed, let's try with "permit any any" line... Gets hits, still can't connect or browse the web.
 I've tried it with my phone and with my laptop, same experience. According to WLC clients are in "Security Policy L3 WebAuth In Progress" stage which seems fine (and timeout is set to the max amount which is 4 hours).
 Anyone had a problem like this and solved it? I have no idea what else I should be doing to make this work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So this is quite an odd issue I'm having and I'm not even sure it's the right place but here we go...
 I am an electrical engineer and I worked in a program called SKM. In order to access it I have a USB stick that acts as a network license. It is plugged into my PC, my PC sees it, and when I open the software it checks to make sure before allowing access. I pay for a few seats of these software, all of which run through the USB network license. It maintains count of how many people are accessing it.
 I have a few remote employees who VPN into my network. In order to access the software they change a few settings in the SKM files per their (SKMs) direction, log into the VPN, and it sees the license, good to go. Except one employee.
 For some reason this one employee cannot "see" the network license once he is logged into the VPN. I went over to his house, brought my laptop, connected to the VPN, only to have the same issue. My laptop could not "see" the license either. 
 I have spoke at length with SKM about the issue and have tried every recommendation on their end. They have simply chalked it up to some network issue, which I'm beginning to agree with after troubleshooting. 
 The license uses something to check and i go to localhost:1947 to check. Not sure what this changes, just stating it as a fact. I've tried looking into the network adapter settings, etc. but I really don't know if what I do will help as I'm not that informed on networking issues. 
 For the record, server side and user side firewalls are all off. Other employees do not have this issue, and neither do I when I am remote from my main office location. I am pretty green in this and know enough just to get into trouble, so be nice if the solution is something simple/stupid.
 ​
 Can anyone recommend any other steps to check or files/checkboxes to look into? TIA

As you can see in the design, we have drawn a separate block for CCTV network. There would be approx. 400+ cameras (indoor & outdoor) with high quality imaging throughout the building. When designing this network, we thought would it be better to implement a three-tier network access, distribution layer and core just for CCTV block. But the rest of the campus network remain collapsed 2-tier network
 In the end I'm only asking this:
 Would you implement a such architecture? Does it make a difference if we just separate the access for CCTV and connect them to just Cores and eliminate the distribution part.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, I'm working on a fairly large enterprise network (3000ish users under this core) and currently I'm having trouble with our core node. There's a whole bunch of other stuff happening with it (like how I can't ping any VSI - even if they're up) but the most baffling to me is that I can't ping the loopback address at all. 
 It's a Cisco 3850 stack with 7 members. 1 master, 1 standby, and 5 line cards. I have Loopback0 configured with an IP of 10.0.255.4 and no matter what, I cannot ping it. Even if I console into the router and use 
 ping 10.0.255.4 source Lo0 
 it times out. Isn't the loopback supposed to be working, even if nothing else is? All it has is the ip address command in its config. 
 Additionally, I can't ping ANY VSI on the device, even though all of them are up. We have a few dozen and they've all been working as expected, but starting this morning we can't ping any of them. Here's an example :
  Interface Vlan148 ip address 10.0.148.1 255.255.255.192 no ip redirects no ip unreachables no ip proxy-arp  
 There's also some netflow commands but they're long and I didn't really feel like typing them out. I doubt they're relevant. 
 Anyway, a computer under Vlan148 (148.17) cannot ping its gateway (148.1) yet it DOES have full access to the whole network internal and outbound. I'm completely lost. 
 Even more weirdly, the device (when console'd in) can't ping anything itself, yet still sends SNMP logs, registers devices in the arp cache, creates OSPF neighbor entries, etc. 
 This is just so strange. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
 EDIT: Partially resolved the issue. Turns out VRRP was causing this somehow, as disabling the VSIs that use VRRP fixed the issue. Tomorrow I'll have to figure out why exactly VRRP did this, but for now, it's resolved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a System Admin at my current company and we just hired a new IT Manager about three weeks ago. Before even being caught up to speed he's been constantly trying to gut all the solutions we currently have in place and replace them with solutions that he's familiar with. To an extent it's understandable but largely seems like he's trying to pass business off to friends but that's a different conversation lol. 
 One of the solutions he's trying to implement is Ivanti which is understandable for MDM/UEM. Though he's trying to implement other solutions of theirs that they don't really excel at. Mainly for the reason of just having everything under one solution provider. I'm more of the mindset of choosing the best solution for that specific need (i.e. MDM, SIEM, AV, VPN). Each company and their requirements typically vary which requires a more tailored approach rather than a blanket it one. 
 My question is pretty simple; What's your experience with Ivanti? 
 I'm trying to understand the company/solution and it's pros/cons so that I can go into the next conversation with the ammo I need to setup the company for success. Whether that be understanding the benefits and going with Ivanti or arguing against it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To cut to the chase, the company I'm working for (~50 people fintech startup) is moving to a new location, and I (sysadmin, but practically responsible for anything IT related) am supposed to be in charge of moving our entire wiring and network infrastructure. To be honest I'm quite intimidated by the task, not only because the previous IT manager (who initially set everything up) did not leave any proper documentation, but also because I just graduated college last year, and I'm only in my current position because said manager left and the company has been unwilling to hire someone to replace him. In other words, I severely lack both experience and guidance. 
 So far, it looks like I have two options:
  
Convince the company to hire the previous manager as a contractor to help with the move. The negotiation will likely be difficult, since the higher-ups still have some ill feelings towards him. But in my (unexperienced) opinion, he should know best about what's going on with our setup.
 Hire an IT service provider. I have never worked with one, so I am unfamiliar with pricing etc, or whether it's even standard for them to take on something like this. 
  
Basically... what the heck should I do?
 Any advice would be appreciated.

At first I thought they might be specifically for LACP, but it appears you can put any ports on the switch in a LAG. Also, if you run the "show port" command, it shows 28 ports, not 24, and you can put them into different VLANs. For example, you can have port 24 in VLAN 100 and port 28 in VLAN 105. 
 TLDR; are there functionally 24 ports on this switch, or 28?

Basically put 2 IP addresses on 1 server ethernet port and then turn off the retiring IP from that interface. If this could be done it would save us a lot of pain with having to have both a tech on our side and a DC tech involved in over a thousand servers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Netflix has a fictionalized account of the development of Spotify called The Playlist. The story is told through the eyes of different stake holders: The founder, the music industry, a lawyer, including an Engineer. While fictionalized, the series does seem to be based on real characters, real events, and what seems to be real tech issues/hurdles. 
 Spoiler alert if you want to watch this. One of the technical breakthroughs per the story seems to be using lossy streaming where they accept a small amount of packet loss in order to avoid latency. I presumed all streaming services do this, but of course Spotify development started in the mid-ish 2000’s and maybe they were one of the first. At any rate, the engineer proclaims this a wholly new protocol that they have patented. But isn’t lossy streaming simply UDP? Can anyone speak to what protocol Spotify supposedly patented (assuming the patent is not also fictionalized)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All - we are moving from an onsite data room in a corporate office to a colocated facility. What are people doing these days as best practice? Are you just leaving a Firewall with an Ethernet switch and a UPS for the corporate users users to join a LAN while doing site-site VPN to the data center with a xfinity line or is there some new hotness to get this done? SD-WAN seems overkill for us.
 ​
 The corporate office is very close to a data center in Atlanta so ping would be <15ms. User count in the office would be 15 tops, and they currently all use (including all of our servers) a single 100/100Mbit line confirmed with no congestion issues. New data center connection to the world would be gigabit, so plenty of bandwidth there.
 Do people still typically leave behind a DC and a NAS? Nothing but a firewall? Direct connect? We run light SQL loads, AD and VOIP, that's about it. There are two other corporate offices in the US connected via site-site VPN and the other sites are OUs in Active Directory. In each site, there is a physical DC as well as virtual on esxi - and esxi obviously hosts all of our servers in each site. There is no shared storage for esxi, it's all local to each site. Considering moving to RD Gateway model for the users who have been used to local LAN speeds for all applications as some are a bit rough via WAN (such as document management).
 Thanks for any ideas!

I want this secondary link to advertise the LAN networks learned from the local L3 LAN switches, but I want to use the reliability metric at this duel circuit location to make routes advertised from the secondary links a feasible successor. 
 All Routers in the EIGRP WAN are only configured to consider the Default metrics (BANDWIDTH/LOAD) when calculating the best path.
 Now, describing this in writing has already made me feel like the answer is "no" because the other EIGRP neighbors would not use this new metric when calculating the best path. It may make more sense to modify the LOAD metric. I think this would mean the routes may not be installed as feasible successors, but they would be used if the primary Router failed. 
 What are your thoughts and ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 Last year I was hired as a sysadmin after having succeeded as a sysadmin elsewhere. I replaced one who had basically given up at the role and let things go well beyond unmanaged. I spent the first 6 months improving every process I could, and met every project I was given. After that I thought of a few projects that I could work on that didn’t require any budget changes, since anything involving a cost I get stonewalled on. 
 But now it’s a year later, and as systems admin I still don’t have access to many of our systems. I don’t have access to our email spam filter. And when I’m on group calls involving my management I’m hardly given a chance to speak, and they do my work on the call instead of letting me, making me feel like I’m in some sort of placeholder position. 
 Having the title longer on my resume is nice, and work/life balance and the pay is okay. But I don’t feel like I’m respected or trusted to have the tools to do my job here. 
 It’s gotten to the point where I’ve begun collecting evidence of my requests that go unanswered, so if I’m ever terminated I can prove I didn’t have what I needed to succeed. Do you think it’s better that I stick it out for another year for that job history/resume experience, or should I look to leave as I’m really no longer learning or able to work on progressing my career here? I am studying to take some cyber security certs to help pad the resume though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So deploying software MSIs via GPO is pretty straight forward. However, what happens when you get an updated installer?
 So let's say in June the software vendor releases v1.0 of their software. Create the GPO and deploy the MSI, easy.
 In August they release v1.2 and you need to upgrade everybody. Are you supposed to:
  
Add another installer to the same GPO, leaving the original so that the new one is an "upgrade" to the previous version, or
 
Remove the previous installer, allowing it to remain on old machines and then add the new installation package.
 
 There are articles everywhere about making the initial software deployment, however, it seems nearly impossible to find anything on upgrading an installation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This could be a little bit off-topic but I gotta ask. I used to be a well-focused, hard-working student back in the day. After I got into the field and started earning I slowly lost that focus. I mean I work really hard and focused at the office because I freaking love IT but I can't focus to study. 
 I want to do a few certifications and even get my master's but sitting down and studying is like torture now. Even tutorials don't work. I get terribly (even intentionally) distracted all the time. I believe it's because we are so used to stimulation when we work in IT (screens, terminals, GUIs, incidents), our brain gets bored when we study. Does that make sense? Have any of you encountered this? How do you focus on studying for certs when your brain says "nooooooo!"? How do you get that 'student mindset' back and focus?

I just downloaded ADAudit, which is great, but the file auditing is only in the premium version.
 Any recommendation for free software that can help me monitor the file events?

 Are these all purely for personal preference/organization purposes, as in it doesn't really matter if you have your certificates exist in "Personal" or any of these sub-folders? For example, I know Remote Desktop authentication certificates can be placed in "Personal" (machine store) and RDP connections will utilize the certificate even without the certificate existing in the "Remote Desktop" sub-folder.
 The reason I'm asking is that I'm needing to move some domain Server/Computer related certs out of the "Personal" folder to somewhere more appropriate and was wondering if the "Enterprise Trust" folder would be the right place for those?

 The solution would be to change the MTU size but, we're split on where we want to perform the change. Me and some others advocate that after a PPPoE session is established between a CPE and the BNG the traffic is ethernet so the mtu size should be changed on the interface we use for eBGP peering. 
 Others insist that is enough to change it on the bba-group that is applied to the template on the BNG.
 I am not sure why that would help, could anyone help clear things up?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to clean up my Group Policy .admx and .adml files but I am having trouble telling which folder and files are actually being used by AD GPO. Is there not a way to find the object path of a referenced GPO? I basically have duplicate files and want to remove them.
 My current folder structure on the domain controller looks like this:
  
Root folder with GPOs: \dc-1\SYSVOL\domain.com\Policies
 Then under that directory, I have about 80 folders that look like this {12A244F0-51EA-4C20-A1BA-68DF5BEA7E8E} and a PolicyDefinitions folder.
 Then, in PolicyDefinitions, I have about 400 .adml and .admx files and then a folder called en-US which has about 500 .adml and .admx files in it too.
  
I noticed when updating ADMX templates, if I over-write any, then I usually get errors when navigating the policies in the Group Policy Management snap-in. It will say something like the GPO is missing, then just restore the original GPO files from a backup copy of the folder I made to fix it.
 Note: I don't want to delete all unused GPOs, I just want to delete the duplicates from the unused folder (whichever one that is). I understand that some GPOs wont be in use but that I also dont want to delete them because then they wont be available.

None of the servers are accessible from the internet and it all exist on internal namespaces. All of my servers and desktops internally can get to the CRLs.
 I have had two sites using internet web server certificates getting flagged by Chrome with the error "NET::ERR_CERT_UNABLE_TO_CHECK_REVOCATION" while Edge is seemingly fine. Additionally, the error doesn't present itself on Chrome for all users. The same person could walk up to two machines and get the error on only one, and a profile wipe will fix the error completely for a while. 
 I can load the certificate, copy the AIA and CRL locations and download them just fine. I have check pkiview.msc for any troubles and everything looks fine, I can't seem to find any issue with the PKI infrastructure. 
 Chrome and Edge seem to be acting differently while unmanaged Firefox doesn't like anything signed by my internal PKI. Would there be any additional logs I can check to find out why Chrome is complaining about not being able to check the CRL and/or can someone help me understand CRLSets and if they might be the problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi girls and guys, thanks for taking the time to read this.
 I need to set up a camera system for a recording studio I'm working for. They want to install PTZ cameras in the whole studio, as well as monitors in two of the rooms, so that the monitors can show any feed taken from any cameras in the studio.
 I was thinking about buying Video Encoders & Decoders and PTZ Hdmi Cameras:
 Camera HDMI Out --> Encoder --> Network --> Decoder in the other room --> Monitor HDMI In 
 But that means that for every camera, I need to buy an encoder. And that gets expensive really quick.
 My question: Could I buy a camera with an ethernet port and plug it in the network directly, then retrieve the feed with the decoder to show on the monitors? Or is an encoder mandatory to be able to do that? Do you guys maybe have an easier solution to this?
 Thanks a lot, really appreciate the help.

 How can i remotely change wan ip + default route to the fortigate with single wan port while remotely connected via wan without disconnecting.
 Option 1: Can i add secondary ip-address to the wan port and then add new static route for the new gateway?
 Option 2: Can i just add another static route (new wan gateway) for the new wan connection and then change the wan interface ip and then connect via new wan ip?
 Can someone explain step by step what i have to do. New wan ip is on different subnet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, 
 I am using VRRP. (MAC and IP's made up). 
 VRRP interface has mac bl:ab:la:bl:ab:la 11.11.11.1
 Active Router 11.11.11.2
 Backup Router 11.11.11.3
 Client is 11.11.11.21 with gateway 11.11.11.1. 
 When Client visit website, there is HTTPS traffic incoming. 
 What I see is that the Client recieve HTTPs traffic from 11.11.11.1 MAC-address. But ALSO recieves the HTTPs traffic from 11.11.11.2 MAC-address. 
 Is that wrong? I expected that the MAC-address of VRRP interface would be used downstream. And not sometimes the active-router MAC-address.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[... and I am baffled that I did. I tell my clients all the time to be careful with suspicious mails. And I guess this time I wasn't careful enough. 
 The original mail seemed to originate from their web hosting provider stating a new invoice was ready for download and contained an HTML file as an attachment which should be the invoice itself. It was forwarded twice within their org, then to me with a request for credentials to access that site since it prompted for them. The website was an absolute perfect replica of the genuine login site and prompted for credentials. I filled it out planing to download the invoice and send it to them, since I knew the sender didn't have them. However the login didn't work. After checking the url I was on the correct site of the provider. What I didn't notice at first: I only got redirected there after entering the credentials. For some reason I got suspicious at that point and checked the HTML file which contained some encrypted java script. Of course I immediately changed the password of the account and fortunately found no suspicious activity. 
 However I am still in shock how stupidly I behaved.
 Edit: just to add, that Mail did not trigger any spam filter nor did opening the HTML file trigger the antivirus or the webfilter of our firewall.
 Edit 2: just uploaded the file to Virustotal and it seems it's actually a trojan. However it's still undetected by our antivirus solution. This file was first uploaded to Virustotal a week ago.

 First, the story, since starting in my role the team has used a shared excel file to manage our IP Space, we have over 300 Remote sites and 4 DCs... and one Excel file. I had mentioned time and time that eventually we're going to go out, build a site, and accidentally use the IP Space that has already been reserved for a different site. Well, the day came, we had our 3rd Party go out and deploy the site as per our instructions, and bang, one of our other sites went offline. Two sites had been deployed using the same Subnet. The team did their testing, PVT passed and they left for the day. Staff started moving in the next day. I then get a P2 the next day, site down, I can't login, and everything down. ISP says they see their side online. Then.. it all comes rushing in, it hits me and all I can do is just sigh take and sip of my coffee.
 So with that, all told and shared, what do we all use? I have only used phpIPAM before, it worked but it wasn't great and crashed a bit.. I'm hoping to purchase something, easy to setup easy to use, and easy to maintain, the golden 3. phpIPAM was none of those things.

 What we found out us that as soon as we remove the docking connection we get prompted to connect to wi-fi and then autopilot kicks in.
 The wi-fi is public so we looked at our firewall logs to see if the fact that deployment get stuck only when on LAN connection is caused by firewall but we don’t see any blocks.
 Is there anyway I can get to some logging on the laptop to see why it is stuck?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hopefully there is someone familiar with the ESE/JET engine who could confirm about cleaning up ESE database transaction log files.
 One AD CS CA is having a rather large C:\Windows\system32\CertLog directory with numerous ESE log files. It seems to be a rather known issue that AD CS does not (sometimes?) clean up the ESE log files, for example:
 https://www.sysadmins.lv/blog-en/database-log-files-are-not-truncated-when-you-perform-a-full-certification-authority-database-backup.aspx
 The reference is contradicting itself. It says "no workaround" but also gives a command that "identifies the start log file number to protect". I had already figured out about as much by using esentutl but would like to confirm I am getting this right.
 In the above linked example all logs with sequence number smaller than 3B, meaning edb00001.log until edb0003B.log could be removed, right? What about edb.log, that one must not be touched? Or one cannot just delete any log file and have a working database?
 It should be rather simple to make a script that:
  
Run esentutl /mk edb.chk
 Parse the Checkpoint line for sequence ID
 Delete all edb#####.log files with ##### smaller than value from step 2
  
I have been searching for a while and could not find one website about actually doing this. Surely someone must have done this before, it does not even look that complicated?! Several hits for just brutely stopping certsvc and deleting all logs which is not what I want to do if this can be done "right", by just deleting unnecessary log files.
 I guess I could just download the whole CertLog and play around with it, see what happens. Will take a while, it being multi-GB...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am getting so frustrated with a certain vendor's customer service every time I report a problem with our laptops. They drain so much energy out of me and send me into loops just to "fix" software problems, which are 99% hardware problems and we just need someone to change the parts that's it. I have such a hard time to get through to those people even though I try to fix everything software related beforehand, but the support always wants more from me. 
 How do you guys deal with customer support? My manager says I should be harsh, but I don't feel like being rude to a guy who is just doing their job and fend off stupid problems. Maybe I am just too soft, I am lost at this point.

 5 days ago, I made a thread about several issues I had with my new setup of Windows 11, mostly about printing issues:
 https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/y8s2x0/windows_11_unusable/
 Well, diving deeper into that, found that the print queue is unmanageable from the Config app, dropping the message of the title, and this seems to be the root of the problem. It also seems that I'm not the only one with the issue:

 I am confused: back then we moved from scripting (.bat) to nice Group Policies for connecting network file shares.
 Now, as I am digging deeper into M365 and Intune I can't find a nice, as easy to use solution, like the Group Policy.
 As I see from my researches, we are now back at scripting the network file share connection but now with PowerShell?
 So even in scripting: We move from a Net Use "One Liner" to a 317 Line PowerShell Script which adds a local task for reconnecting a single drive? (using https://intunedrivemapping.azurewebsites.net/).
 Maybe I am thinking the wrong way, because modern management and cloud is totally different but:
 Microsoft offers Azure Files as a File Server replacement. These Shares also need to be connected.

 The 1310nm transceivers state that they are rated for 2 kilometer runs, while the 850nm transceivers state that they are rated for 550 meter runs.
 Are there any downsides to using the two 1310nm transceivers on both ends? 1310nm seems to be better

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[No, it´s not about their printer line, that topic has a special place in my "not to be opened again" box. 
 It´s been nearly two decades since I last bought any HP product for good reason but as life goes on and people think it´s ok to purchase HP products I have to troubleshoot them. 
 First the server guy got blamed - me. 
 Than the network guy got blamed - me. 
 Than the software got blamed. So I made contact with the vendor who told me that the network guy needs to get his hands on the problem. The logs stated that also, at least the software ones. So I conceded and went back to troubleshoot even though I was pretty certain it´s not the network, most certainly not the server and probably not the software. It runs on several devices without any issues. 
 After another sleepless night it dawned to me that the only difference is, that the software is installed on a HP desk. So I grabbed just another device, slapped the software on and it runs. It just does, what it´s supposed to do, it works. So it´s the HP trash again. Why? I don´t know. I wish I could say that every single HP device is in it´s own contained part of the network, isolated from the rest of the world and hidden from any tech guy but they are everywhere and the rules applied are the same as for all the other stuff. The one and only difference is, they are HP desks. 
 I honestly don´t know who made the cost-benefit analysis or if there even is one, but I´d like to see which maniac decided to buy HP products.

 I encourage you to read the github and check it out for yourself.

 I just really wanted to take a moment and publicly thank this guy - Hopefully he reads r/sysadmin
 You could package this script into a full app and make a fortune -- instead, this guy updates and provides this script for free for anyone to benefit.
 and sure enough, it supports oauth/modern auth
 Thank You David Barrett. You have saved quite possibly hundreds of hours of my life.

 I work remotely so physically seeing and talking and getting to know your local sysadmin is even harder than it is.
 I had simple questions to ask him to gain some personal perspective on how he got to where he is now.
 And I was immediately shot down by my supervisor, being told to please do not contact him, only supervisors and up can do that.
 And you know what? I sorta get it. I would imagine having 10s or even 100s of agents contacting you could get tiring.
 But it still sucks that I'm pretty much forbidden to gain a little wisdom from him. Oh well.

I'm looking at doing a proof of concept for a possible project to migrate ALL user, group, resource data from one tenant to another and there appears to be two different pathways - both updated within the last 6 months by Microsoft and neither has any reference to the other (with the exception of recommended content).
 ​
  
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/mailbox-migration/migrate-mailboxes-across-tenants vs https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/enterprise/cross-tenant-mailbox-migration?view=o365-worldwide 
  
 ​
 Which is the better method?
 Notes: 
 The primary domain in the source tenant will remain as the primary domain for the users migrated into the target (and ONLY for these users, everyone else already on the target tenant will use the company's normal domain).
 The source tenant is only 3 months old but user accounts contain data and calendars migrated from an on-prem Kerio server.
 Both tenants have their own Mimecast Email Gateway, but after migration is complete, there will be only the target's Mimecast service.

Our network operates on a far greater scale than anything I've studied so I'm hoping someone can point me in the right direction for a resource I can read to help me get up to speed. 
 So long story short... At the CCNA level there is not much BGP required. As long as you know "its the routing protocol of the internet" your about good... Well anyways we have our core and 2 wan edge devices. These wan edge devices have tunnels to each of our some 300+ locations. Each location has a BGP AS number... all in the 65000 private range (at least as far as I understand it). 
 So I guess what I'm asking is does anyone have a resource I can read and study up on using BGP as a primary internal routing protocol? I have googled iBGP but man... the amount of info out there is nuts. It's so much to the point I dont even know where to begin reading...

 Please share with me something :/ I have been just a hobbyist in computers since I was a kid, I guess. Building my first computer at a young age, growing in to help-desk after flipping them burgers for X years after college.. A typical story, I assume...
 Was on helpdesk in large org for 5 years, now I have been a SysAdmin for a year and some change (Age 31) and I have been overwhelmed by the sheer infinite amount of things you need to learn. My feelings gravitate to 'why am I even doing this?'..
 My boss is amazing. My team is amazing. I have finally landed a kush job with a description that I thought I always wanted (small shop now doing some networking, security wherever, being new to virtualization, everything a sysadmin would do with an IT team of 3 in the datacenter and 300 employees).
 My motivation is fucked. Every day I want to do good for my co-workers and boss but I just don't feel like I have it in me to learn and think and be creative every day... I just had a very overdue vacation a few months ago and I already have this burnout feeling.. whyyyy.. I question if I am even interested in IT.. working in the dirt or cleaning toilets can NOT be a better deal for me but it is what I fantasize about. something mindless...but idk.. I can continue to rant but I think anyone reading this get's the point. Work is getting hard and I want to be motivated.
 (Possible remedy? Can changing my habits and routine give me a better outlook? ie start waking up earlier and getting some exercise. Can I coax my mind in to enjoying this job by employing other changes in different parts of my life?)

Not sure if this is a factor? But looking to understand if this is a best solution for site to site locations still or if there is something else I should be pursuing... This area is not my number 1 - so forgive me. Both units are Fortigate. Both sites are on 1000/1000 fiber... Just seems like I can count to 4 before I see anything load up like an SMB query on a file server... etc... but latency between sites is a solid 5ms....

 I've been team team for over a decade and can afford them but recently, I've seen more and more problems with them. I even had a bug that TAC said "We will wait until someone reports this bug to see if code comes out to fix it" when THEY discovered the bug with me while working on the case. I asked if THEY might be the right team to report said bug and they blew me off. I don't need anything crazy -10G uplinks, 48-1G ports, stackable. Right now I'm running 9200 switches and was looking for recommendations. 
 I'm leaning toward HP/Aruba but need to dig into which model is closest to these 9200s and want to stay away from anything that handcuffs you with licensing (I.E. charges you to make a 1G port a 10G). Any recommendations? I'll end up with about 350 spread out across all of my remote sites so I wanted to buy a few now and plug them in on an upcoming small project to get some time with them.

 so i am tasked to disable TLS 1.0 and 1.1 and only using 1.2 for security reasons on all our windows server machines 
 this is what i am going to do, please correct me if i am wrong 
 1- Disable TLS 1.0, 1.1 from internet options 
 2- Run power-shell script to set the registry keys as described in this url

I'm in my first semester of college (computer technology) and just got a job as a network technician by dumb luck. One of my first tasks is to get an old managed HP 1910 switch up and running to be added to the network. I have a brand new USB to rj45 console cable. I'm using putty with serial connection enabled. Bits per second 38400. Data bits 8. Stop bits 1. With both parity and flow control set to none. Com 3 is the only serial line that pulls up a terminal. However the terminal is blank and after waiting 10+ mins multiple times and even power cycling during the terminal or before trying to connect, I am unable to get any text to appear on the terminal screen. Am I missing something? I'm feeling kinda dumb here. Any advice is greatly appreciated.

 There is Cat6 cabling between my MDF and IDF. It's OK for now but an opportunity presented itself to have fiber run between them at almost no extra cost as part of another project. I don't have any equipment right now that would be using it so it would be kind of future proofing and would be nice to have an option of 10Gig as I can easily see that being asked for in the future. Now, having never used fiber before I'm not sure what fiber should be run? I was asked if I want single- or multi-mode. What should I choose? I traditionally stick with Cisco switches, in case this is important and the distance between the locations is at most 200 ft. Are there any other questions that I should ask at this time or when I'm ready to use that link?

 Does MAC address whitelisting (I one this is also not good, but 802.1x is not on the table for a while) configured on firewall still work for devices that connect to unmanaged switch, like desktop connected to netgear 8 port desk switch over Ethernet?
 My company can’t afford wiring new lines right now and we have some machines that can’t use Wi-Fi, they must be plugged in. The topic of unmanaged switches came up. 
 If I can at least whitelist devices on the firewall to allow/deny computers that plug into the unmanaged switch it would be ok for a little bit.
 Would love to hear what everyone thinks about it!

 She was just one of the 300ish users I supported, never had any extensive dealings with her, never anything beyond answering the phone/Teams when she called for support.
 Meanwhile, the guy who owned the company, the guy who was supposedly my boss to whom I was supposed to report to, after keeping his company running 24/7 for all those years never talked to me while I was there, "negotiated" with me when I turned in my notice by sending verbal messages through somebody who then relayed them through HR who then verbally passed the message to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Early last week PC across our org starting having one of three types of error:
 1 - PC would BSOD, possibly multiple times with no obvious cause and disparate error codes
 2 - Every application would crash in turn with an error indicating issues with Trend Micro's dlls
 3 - PC would boot to a black screen, but be online (even on wifi) and respond to remote commands (though any form of remote control would still yield a black screen)
 Eventually issues 1 and 2 would evolve into 3 in many, though not all cases. An upgrade of TM's client was complete or in progress at the time of the first presentation, which coupled with issue 2 made us conclude a botched update was the cause.
 Unfortunately repair didn't seem to work and TM's support suggested we proceed with a hard uninstall using their CUT program. The problem was this took an extremely long time (over a day in one notable case). We dug through the logs and discovered CUT was attempting dozens of tries with long timeouts for each operation, before eventually failing and moving to a more aggressive option (ie removing a service after failing to stop it).
 We discovered that an ini file was created upon launching the CUT executable and we could, if we were quick enough, replace that ini file with a modded one that reduced timeouts and # of attempts to something more manageable. This brought down removal time from hours to about 20 minutes per machine, which could be run in parallel.
 On some machines CUT would complete on first try, others would require a second application even though CUT logged its successful completion.
 After that we could reinstall the TM client with no further issue.
 TM support told us this has never happened before (when does it ever) and we're the only ones reporting it (what good luck), so I thought it'd be useful to put it here for anyone that should happen to suffer this issue or something similar.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Has anyone had any success reinstalling/resetting Windows Defender in Windows 10?
 We use crowdstrike as our main AV but would like to start using scheduled scanning on our devices per recommendations from our SoC.
 Our devices are in Intune, and I’ve found out that Defender will automatically run in “passive Mode” if we onboard our devices to Defender for Endpoint.
 This works fine on our newer deployed devices (via autopilot), but it won’t work on our previous ones that were “imaged” using MDT. I have a feeling that the previous image broke defender somehow since it included crowdstrike on the install, rather than installing after enrolling via autopilot in the new deployment.
 I’ve tried the commands I’ve found online to reset the app using AppX, re-registering it again using add-appx using the built in windows 10 manifest.xml, and resetting the app via “Windows Settings”. I’ve also tried restarting the Windows Defender service, modifying registry entries to enable “passive mode”, and simply enabling periodic scanning on the device itself. Windows defender seem to just won’t start at all. I checked group policy and Defender is not blocked.
 Any other ideas you guys may have to get defender running again? I could try uninstalling crowdstrike, but thats not really feasible if it’s the only way to deploy it on our older devices.

 Big industry-changing stuff like when Windows 95 came on the scene and the world hustled to move to distributed systems hiring anyone who could spell PC. Or when Amazon released commercial cloud computing and suddenly the "cloud engineer" title was the fat paycheck.
 Or maybe I just say screw it to cutting-edge tech and get a job supporting the Mainframe and COBOL? That stuff will be around long after I'm retired. Plus from what I see folks to support that is in very high demand.

 I was doing MX switch last night, because I was changing security email provider to MS, and I forgot to remove a transport rule in Exchange Online. Now, I have a lot of incoming emails piled up as Failed due to transport rule blocked them all.

 ​
 Im a entry-Level Sys-Admin and doing a Server upgrade at my workplace right now.
 We are switching from a Terra 7220 G1 to a 7220 G4, and are using VMware for Virtualisation.
 The G1 runs ESXI 5.5, which I plan to Upgrade to 6.5/6.7 before migrating the VMs to the G4 Server, which is expected to run ESXI 7.X on it.
 ​
 Therefore i need to know wheter my Hardware is compatibel with ESXI 6.5
 I already went to Vmware Hardware compatibility Guide to check it, but the list ends with a Terra G2 modell. 
 ​
 Does anyone know how to find out if my G1 is compatibel?
 Its equiped with 2x Intel Xeon E5-2600-v2 Series, which are supported by ESXI 6.5/6.7.
 Or do you think I should just try to upgrade?

Exchange picks up on it and blocks the legitimate email from sending emails since it is flagging it as spam. This disables and user and the only way to get around it is to create a rule in Exchange with a "body contains" rule. We use MWB Nebula to locate vulnerabilities and I do not see one on our Exchange server. I am a Jr. System Admin so Cybersecurity is something I am learning. I believe this would obviously be a Blue Team issue. We do have a vendor we work with for issues like this, but would like anyone's input if possible. Any more info just ask.

 We have a bunch of WMware VM's with BIOS firmware but goal is to get them to UEFI. We found that we can convert the disk using MBR2GPT.exe, but it brings an unexpected issue, the EFI partition is created at the end of the disk and the main partition is not extendable after that :(
 Also i could put MBR2GPT.exe to a MECM task sequence which boots into WinPE, converts the disk and shuts down, which is convenient.
 Has anyone faced a similar issue? How did you solve it? How to automate this as much as possible so that EFI partition is first on the disk?

 Can anyone tell me how "User Account Control: Detect application installations and prompt for elevation" actually works?
 Enabled: Application installation packages that require an elevation of privilege to install are detected and the user is prompted for administrative credentials.
 Disabled: Application installation packages that require an elevation of privilege to install aren't detected and the user isn't prompted for administrative credentials.
 ​
 Microsoft says to set it to whatever fits my environment, CIS Benchmark says to enable it. But: Auditor actually recommends disabling it.
 So, which one is more secure? Does "Disabled" mean additional packages are simply not installed at all or does it install them without a UAC prompt?

 So heres the scenario: Our client has Active Directory, and we implemented Folder Redirection via GPO for all users (even AppData) and now it creates so many problems that i have no idea what to do. 
 For example: User is logged out from apps whenever he logs on other computer. He logs with his domain user on one PC then logs off and then logs on the other computer. When he logs off and comes back to his main pc and logs onto it, he is logged out in every app he was logged in. Google Chrome doesn't work properly, sometimes it doesn't even want to open.
 Do I remove AppData from Folder Redirection? Are there any other solutions that allow to load Users Profile on different computers? Maybe Folder Redirection should be completely removed?
 If i missed something that you need to help me, tell me in the comments, English isn't my first language so sorry about that.

 Here's what I've looked into:
  
HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Keyboard Layout\Preload has correct number of keyboard layouts - the two I've set (00000409 and 00000419, English and russian) - as expected
 
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\Keyboard Layout\Preload has English only (00000409) - as expected
 
In settings > time and language > language I only have two languages selected, 1 keyboard layout each - as expected
 
powershell's Get-WinUserLanguageList returns two languages, 1 keyboard layout each - as expected
 
 And yet, there are three keyboard layouts to select from in tray - being two I've selected and 1 extra called QAA, which is basically English.
 Logging out and back in again doesn't fix it. Rebooting doesn't fix it. The only way to fix it is to override current settings - either using powershell or manually resetting up all that. But problem appears again sooner or later - maybe next reboot or maybe 4 months in - appears to be random.
 Googling leads nowhere as all there either temporal fixes that I've mentioned or common useless advice like "run sfc scannow"
 Has anyone figured out how to get rid of that problem permanently?

 Is there a way to remotely force a physical drive into down state on a Dell SCv3020 array?
 One disk in the array has very high (>300ms) latency and filling the log with "[Aborted]" messages but for whatever reason the array controller hasn't taken the disk out of the RAID. The high latency on one disk is breaking everything connected to the array.
 I can only find "Release Disk" in Storage Manager but that is trying to rebalance the RAID by moving the data away from the failing disk which will take a very long time.
 I'd like to force the disk into failed state without rebalancing. I know I could pull the disk, but I'm trying to avoid a long car journey.

 I am trying to troubleshoot an issue for a customer where our screen sharing solution requires port 7100 to be open in order for it to work correctly however, with this particular customer we've found that their managed devices are not working. We can bring in unmanaged devices on their network and our software works fine but it's only when we try and connect using their managed devices do we get blocked. 
 We've disabled their Sophos AV, apparently they've had a look at their inbound/outbound ports on Windows Defender and can't see any blocks on 7100 so my question is - how else can we find out what's blocking this port? Any scanning tools that will point us to some kind of GPO or other application block?

 I'm unable to setup the Process Explorer to run at startup via Task Scheduler. Regardless if I create the task via the Process Explorer menu 'Run at startup' or manually I am unable to make it work.
 I've installed Systeinternals via winget: ````
  
winget list sysinternals
 Name Id Version Source
 Sysinternals Suite 9P7KNL5RWT25 2022.10.1.0 msstore ````
  
Running the task does nothing and there are no errors in the task history log. It is as if nothing happens. 'Run with highest privileges' also does nothing What I find very odd about the installation is that procexp.exe is a 0kb file in the Local/Microsoft/WindowsApps folder. It has no icon but I can run it normally by double-clicking on it. However if I use Task Scheduler and I try to selected it (via Browser on Actions) I get the following error:  procexp.exe The file cannot be accessed by the system. 
 Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.

 We deploy our image via ConfMgr. Enterprise version is selected from the iso as a untouched image. All our changes are done via GPO or CM after the iso. Originally it did not have a key defined (overlooked/assumed AD KMS would take over), but thats now been corrected in the Task Sequence.
 I stumbled on the fact my laptop is one thats affected; it's using the Pro retail key thats burnt into UEFI. ok - no problem; slmgr /upk, /ipk {GVLK}, /ato and /dli to confirm. /dli shows the expected KMS activation from AD. Great, job done i'll get that pushed out to existing clients via a Task Sequence that runs those same commands. A week later i noticed my laptop is back to the pro licence (i reboot weekly; sleep the laptop during the week)
 redo the slmgr process, reboot and now the key has reverted back to the pro retail key again.
 has anyone seen this behaviour or know why it's occuring?

 I am attempting to identify a specific planning tool that I have encountered in the past, but cannot for the life of me remember the name of. My Google foo seems to be pretty bad today as well.
 In summary, this is a tool published by a company (can’t remember the name) that allows you to pay an annual license fee to get access to part libraries from various vendors and then use these to build BOMs to submit to suppliers. I know it has libraries from Aruba, Cisco, Extreme, to name but a few. 
 Before anyone says it, I am not thinking about Visio or anything like that. This tool allows you to select e.g. an Aruba CX6300 switch and then can show you which addon modules are compatible with this switch and would then allow you build a complete BOM around this, including PSUs, SFP transceivers, interconnect cables, etc.
 Please, if anybody knows this tool, I am trying to identify it, as I need to submit budget approval for it.

 ​
 ​
 I have a scenario and couple questions 
 ​
 Here is the following configuration of the two organizations:
 ​
 Organization 1:
 ​
 Exchange 2013 CU23
 ​
 Organization 2:
 ​
 Exchange 2016 CU19 & Hybrid 
 ​
 Both organizations have an internal connection between them and a Full Trust Relationship.
 ​
 ​
 I am very confused related to the Organization Relationships.
 ​
 I have found an article like below.
 ​
 https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/the-hybrid-mesh/ba-p/605910
 ​
 MS says:
 ​
  
Create an Organization Relationship between Contoso on-premises and Tailspin on-premises. Use a unique SMTP namespace for the domain name in the Organization Relationship like OnPrem.Tailspintoys.com
  
Note: In most environments, the shared namespace “TailspinToys.com” can be used as the Target address for on-premises users and you would not need the additional namespace of onprem.TailspinToys.com. However, to account for all complex partnerships that could be in place, a unique namespace used as the target address will ensure free busy works properly.
 ​
 Note: The domain name “TailspinToys.com” is not present in any of the Organization Relationships in the Contoso environment. Keeping this name out of the Organization Relationship will ensure that you can continue to use the shared namespace and see free/busy information.
 ​
 ​
 ​
 ​
 Do I have to use unique address like OnPrem.companyb.com? Because We dont have any DNS record such as OnPrem.companyb.com. I want to use companyb.com as domain name for Organization Relationship between Company A on-premises and Company B on-premises.

 We are designing a network for our new medical center within the region. When designing a hierarchical network, we were having brainstorming discussion with internal engineering team to take a decide on using 3-tier network for Data Center and 2-Tier for Campus (endpoints and end devices)
 The center would occupy 2000+ endpoints in the network. We propose two main core switches, setup as VSS and aggregating approx. 70 access switches installed in different floors in the building communication rooms. Single stack contains 5 or 6 access switches with 10G uplinks to upstream core switches. Access are all L2, and we route between VLANs using SVIs on the core switches and some VLANs are firewalled for Guest and IoT devices.
 Pair of high specs firewalls connected to cores for perimeter (internet, wan & dmz) and internal segmentation (servers & end devices, depending on the use case and security controls requirements.
 Eventually, with regard to servers, we are thinking about having 3-tier network: access > distribution > main campus core
 Two distribution switches with Servers SVIs on them or Firewalls. 
 L2 links terminated on Cores with Point-to-Point transit VLAN. Servers connecting to TOR access switches. 
 Please share your thoughts and comments for 3-tier approach and feel free to add your invaluable inputs if anything is wrong in the design.

Thanks all.
 ​
 EDIT: More info. I set the vm file location to the external hdd and when I tried to enable the physical usb external hdd to connect to the vm to load the disk img backup, an error popped up basically saying I can't do those 2 things from an external drive?? It wouldn't let me boot and recover the backup since if I enabled the physical external hdd to the vm to access the img backup, it would disable the external hdd to the main pc which is what the vm is running from. 
 Is there a way for the external hdd to work in the vm and with the main pc at the same time?
 ​
 Have I just missed something obvious? I am confused lol. 
 ​
 I must've done something wrong. Most people can't just boot up their backup on the internal drive because who has enough space for that? (Essentially 2 copies of a whole computer on the same drive) Mine is only 240gb, how do guys with maxed 3tb drives test their backups? Nobody just assumes their giant backup works?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work at a university, and most staff that have IT issues seem to think they already know the answer, or just have general "hmm I still think IT is at fault" demeanour when you're giving an answer to their problem.
 I generally try to be really civil, but sometimes the answer to an issue is so glaringly obvious, and becomes a real waste of time have to go through all the rigmarole to prove that the problem is a user problem, not a system/network/IT problem, that I feel I need to be a bit more blunt and not worry too much about how I'm coming across.
 To give you an example, just recently I had person in senior management raise a ticket because an important document couldn't be found on SharePoint. The ticket was escalated to me, and after looking into it, it just looks like someone moved the doc into another folder (probably accidentally). The user was trying to access the file from a URL link, and when it didn't work (because the file was moved), they panicked and assumed IT had done something. When I told the user that the file was most likely moved, their response is still implying that IT had something to do with it, as no one in their team (over 10 people, all with edit access to the file) would have moved the file. I reiterated that it was probably an accident by someone in the team, and a fairly common and easily addressable mistake, but the user has now involved their manager, to make sure the problem doesn't happen again. It's now become a way bigger issue than it ever needed to be, all because someone just accidentally moved an important file, and the user just can't accept that this happened and it wasn't someone IT behind it.
 This is just a recent scenario. Issues like these seem to happen all the time, where frustrated users just don't believe what you're telling them and seem to just blame anything on either IT staff or systems that they don't understand, yet speak with authority on.
 Any advice?

I have a weird space constraint in a certain spot and I need to route an ethernet connection to two devices and the cleanest solution would probably be something that plugs in like that. 100 Mbit switch is perfectly acceptable. No need to gigabit.

 I'm designing an EVPN-BGP network. I have never gone into etails wrt BGP.I read Krattiger's book about EVPN-BGP a Nexus 9000's perspective and there he always mentions that two fashions of eBGP might be used:
  
one AS for the spines, one for all the leaves; here the ption of accepting prefixes from own's AS must be cnfigured, otherwise all the announcements will be discarded
 one AS for the spines and one AS for each VTEP; here I only see a bit of complexity in configuring each VTEP because I cannot apply the same settings.
  
eBGP was proposed because, I think, if a peer goes down, then all the family memebers announce by it will be witdrawn in the peer's BGP table.
 Then somebody proposed to use
 3) iBGP but with Route Reflectors, because when a VTEP goes down all the family members announced by it will be withdrawn by the BGP tables of of al lthe clients.
 What do you implement in your own EVPN-BGP design and why?Any preferences among the 3 options above?
 TIA, Pan

        <updated>2022-10-23T21:20:11.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The idea is simple: We need dynamic allocation of an incoming request via https, which will use a domain, e.g subdomain1.domain.org, which needs to be mapped to internal IP X.X.X.X and Port Y. Then, subdomain2.domain.org needs to go on a different port and IP. 
 Nothing special so far.
 ​
 Dynamic meaning on the fly, without having to edit a config file. These mapping need to be editable by another program.
 ​
 The subdomains can be created at will and need to be routed to the correct instance of our program (where each instance runs on a different port).
 There is nothing special needed, just a simple domain -> IP:PORT mapping like HAProxy can do.
 However, HAProxy has its Runtime API, which seems to not be able to hold up to this task.
 ​
 Do I need to create a custom forwarding solution, or are there existing ones which i could use?
 I personally think that HAProxy is really made for this, but it does not feature a way for dyamic creation. Since adding needs to be done ASAP, these edits cannot be done by hand and have to happen automatically.
 ​
 Has anyone here experience regarding automatic proxying? It seems like NGINX has some kind of feature like this, but then i'd had to pay a few thousands bucks for their NGINX plus model.
 ​
 Please let me know if more clarification is needed.

 I'd like to hear what laptop you have and how it differs from what your users have, or if you have multiple tiers.
 The market really is Dell, HP and Lenovo. I'm not really interested in HP.
 They say IT should have what the users have. We're a bit tricky since we have a ton of tech employees and engineers.
 A lot of people are running docker on their laptops but do not need absolutely absurd power but this just means the low end is out.
 I think we can cross off anything extremely low end, but also 9 pound workstation devices.

We recently merged with several other “local” businesses and are looking to build out a core network between the sites. Our CIO has already indicated his desire that the core will be a DWDM fiber ring but has left the rest to me (with assistance from some of our consultants).
 I’m curious if anyone has any insights that they learned from doing something similar. Anything you wished you incorporated into the design? Any vendor preferences or experience? We are currently looking at Ciena and Adva for DWDM and Cisco and Extreme for Core Routing. And I’d like to have the same vendor supply both core routing and Data Center switches. Corporate Network itself will be Cisco for the foreseeable future.
 Size wise (for context) Site is Core Chassis, 24 IDFs (30 9400 chassis) and ~400 Access Switches. ~65-70000 endpoints according to ISE. The other three sites are about 1/3-1/2 that size

 I want to have an internal LAN, for internal equipment, which can also be accessible through WiFi. I also want to create a public LAN for guests, wireless as well as wired (from selected places). The private lan should not be reachable from the public lan, but the opposite is ok.
 We managed to lay our hands on a Cisco WLC plus 5 APs as well as two Cisco manageable switches, so I believe that the only thing missing here is a router (preferably Cisco). Can anyone please suggest a suitable model? It needs to be able to handle Gigabit Ethernet, otherwise I don’t believe it needs any fancy features 
 I have found a used Cisco ISR 4331 for about $250 which is within my budget. Would this be a good choice?

 My question is: is it better try try to supernet and add large ranges of IP, and maybe misalign some ranges, or to add all of the smaller ranges and ensure we have the right sites associated with each subnet?
 There is a business case for the smaller subnets, but I'm not sure if it creates issues with lag on site lookup.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is the fourth job in 7 years I'm getting laid off due to mergers or outsourcing and it's getting tiring. I'm in my mid-30s, right here when age discrimination starts becoming a real thing, and just want a stable company for the next 15 years. 
 So the good news is the company is giving us 10 months severance plus 1 week's pay for every year and 6 months of insurance after we are let go.
 The bad news. When our director called us into the conference call to give the news he was very candid and probably told us more than he should have. Basically, it boils down to money, the business leaders found they can hire in Europe/UK for 60% of US wages. They can hire Indians for 20% of US wages. Australian wages were a wash with the US. They also decided it's cheaper to move the HQ to Ireland (with much lower corporate taxes) and import to the US. 
 I work with folks from Ireland and UK every day and their work is every bit as good as what we do in the states. I'm not bashing their skills but more concerned if we, Americans with insane salaries, have priced ourselves out of the global market. The state I live in has an average income of $61k. I make $153k. I make this kind of money with no degrees, a couple of entry-level certs, and to be honest very little effort on my part. I just kind of have been the guy people get along with and every few years some past co-worker DMs me if I'm interested in a new job. 
 Add in the sharp rise in remote work capabilities it's easier than ever for companies to look abroad for workers. Hell, even Canada and Mexico have much cheaper labor.

 So I have 15 Surface Go with Windows 10 with S mode. I need to make all of them have Windows 10 Home(via the free switch using Microsoft Store) with the same set of software. I figured the easiest way to do this is to clone a "master" Surface Go and clone them to the other 14 machines using Clonezilla.
 I am wondering if the master Surface Go's license key will get cloned to the other machines or if their key is already burnt into bios and I don't have to worry about them. Or do I have to find the keys for each machine and "re-key" them after cloning? 
 As of now, I don't have a budget to get VLs or Enterprise licensing but if that is the only way to do it properly I'll have to do some convincing to my bosses...

 I understand in place upgrade on DC is not recommended. Would it be ok to demote, in place upgrade, promote? (of course, health check, migrate FSMO etc).
 I guess the next best option is deploy new VM, demote the old server and change IP of new server, then promote. But i lose the name and for matters of convenience, i'd rather not. Could i safely use the first option?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So its been about a year since I have been with this public community college. 
 One of the things they do here is when an employee retires they get to keep there email address. 
 I personally feel that that's not a good thing. I did some PowerShell here and there and basically did this. 
 1) Who are all the retired employees?
 2) When was the last time they have logged in to there exchange 2016 or Online. 
 Nearly all have not logged in within a year or more. 
 ​
 My concerns are that;
 1) They don't have MFA enabled. 
 2) They may contain sensitive information in those emails. So if the email becomes compromised that becomes accessible information. 
 3) If the account becomes compromised, they can use that email to communicate to other employees and make it easier to social engineer them. 
 4) A wasted license. 
 I am still new to my role and I may be paranoid for nothing, so from a more experienced individual what are your thoughts on this and if its best to get rid of this plan what are the reasons? 
 I have some directors that agree with me, but my VP of technology doesn't (Ironic I think). 
 ​
 But of course if a user isn't trying to log into there account would it really get compromised? I don't know, but I appreciate every input! Thanks.

 Unfortunately, disaster struck and now I'm trying to recreate it from scratch and I'm having a hell of a time trying to get even the most basic stuff working. I've managed to set the 'admin' password and can query the root DSE from Apache DirectoryStudio using 'cn=admin,cn=config', but that's about it. I can't change, create, or delete anything.
 I made a post on something similar two years ago, but I was trying to create a RO user for RADIUS to search the LDAP database for user authentication. I just don't remember encountering this specific issue before, the last I recalled, I had to create a RO user but it appears I can't even do that as the admin user itself is RO.
 What's even more frustrating is that all the howtos and docs I've been reading over the last four days all assume that admin can write! My admin account can't write anything except its own password apparently.
 How do I get the admin user access to everything (like a proper admin account) so I can get this project off the ground? 
 Thank you for your help!

Ever since they’ve joined everyone has started complaining about slow internet and we cannot upgrade our main ISP connection since we’re already on the highest (albeit slow in general) service tier. 
 Luckily a new ISP became available and we are about to sign up with them. 
 So I had a question about how to best configure my firewall appliance now that I’ll have two ISPs. 
 What are the pros/cons of these ideas:
  
Load balance WAN1 and WAN2. 
 
Get the testers on a dedicated switch that would connect to a dedicated interface port on the firewall and route that traffic to WAN2. 
 
 Which of these two would be the better option? If there are any better ideas let me know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone. Just looking for some advice. I work in a public hospital system with 8500+ employees. Myself and one other person are responsible for Mobile Technology in all forms: Vocera, Encrypted Flash drives/Ironkey, iPads/iPhones and MDM (Intune), the corporate cellular account, and BYOD support. 
 We've basically been slammed since COVID happened. We work 50 hours a week, then get paged off hours because we didn't get to that one ticket that is now suddenly "patient impacting". Despite working without a lunch break, being in many meetings for projects (6-10hrs a week), and working my ticket queue when possible, we never catch up. For the past two years, we've never been under 100 requests, and we've been building two new sites that have many different mobile applications in which I'll somehow be supporting. As of current, my team of two support over 17k devices including 5k personal devices in BYOD. 
 I know nowhere is perfect, but I feel my boss is being arrogant when I ask him about hiring more people. His response is always "this is only a phase" or "we're fully staffed at what we have, we'll have to get caught up". But other internal IT depts are hiring like crazy. The apps team hired 5 in the last two years and the epic team brought in a whole company of 20 contractors to do their breakfix while they worked on our new sites. Just as examples
 I guess what I'm asking is is this situation everywhere? Am I dreaming that IT life doesn't have to be so understaffed and overworked? I'm salary and don't break 75k, and my coworker is at 55k. We get great healthcare, which is why I stay, but just wondering if you all think I should man up and realize I work in a stressful environment and IT is that way everywhere, or is there better out there somewhere? What's it like for you all in similar roles? Thanks for your thoughts!

 I am looking for a sanity check and guidance on how to proceed. I started at a new firm almost a year ago and the environment feels like I went back in time twenty years. There are three members of the team: the senior guy, my boss and me. Basically the situation is: I am trying to propose modern ways to design the network and the senior guy isn't having any of it. Here's an example:
 In the current topology, the senior guy has configured one firewall interface per VLAN. When they ran out of interfaces on the firewall, the previous person in my position configured an 802.1q trunk for three VLANs, to which the senior guy objected to, but it was done anyway because obviously, there weren't any firewall interfaces left.

 They do not return results, just whether the domain shows in the leak. My company’s does. 
 I’ve heard nothing from MS. I also suspect there is nothing sensitive I’ve given MS.
 I’m curious if anyone has been informed by MS that they were affected. 
 MS’ statement says, in part, “ Our investigation found no indication customer accounts or systems were compromised. We have directly notified the affected customers.”
 I’m also curious how they define “affected customers.”

 I am hoping that the collective minds here on Reddit can help me out. 
 I am the administrator of an air gapped network inside of our Enterprise-Wide Network 
 In order to access it the users must be on the EWN. 
 The network has its own domain which does not trust the EWN. 
 There is no smtp traffic allowed out. 
 The only way the end users can get it is to have an account on in my domain, as well as on the Enterprise domain. They can access 1 server over RDP.
 Now my problem is this, the accounts are set to expire every 30 days for security purposes. BUT there is no way the user can log in via RDP if their account is expired, to reset the account. 
 I am looking for a method for the users can manage their own accounts, so they don’t have to call me to reset their passwords. Are any of you in the same situation, and how do you resolve it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings fellow IT professionals. I need your help and advise regarding PSU configuration issues in a Dell Poweredge r6515. It is running RHEL 8. I hope I can explain this clearly…
 We recently upgraded PSU’s in the server from 550w to 700w. According to the Dell website, the new PSU you install will take on the firmware of the previously installed PSU. So, in this case our 700w PSU is using the firmware of the 550w PSU. Obviously we just need to install the firmware for the 700w PSU’s. Here’s the catch, Dell doesn’t have any firmware for 700w PSU’s for this server available to download. There should be firmware available for download because you can buy the r6515 server from Dell with the 700w PSU’s installed. 
 When we boot up the server it enters the bios and gives a low power warning. 
 IDRAC says the input wattage is 666 and output wattage - rated: 700, actual: 550. 
 We have been talking back and forth with Dell tech support and their tier 1 support has no clue what’s going on. They sent technicians out this week to install a new power board but that didn’t do anything to help. The technicians got one of the Dell tier 2 support guys in the phone but he didn’t help much either. 
 Anyone have any ideas or have any experience with this situation?

I am the one on my team tasked with automating. However, automation isn’t my primary job. I have an associates degree and some Cisco certs (including DEVNETASC). I’ve created web apps, automated network configuration, and created scheduled scripts to automate repeatable tasks. I have seen job postings for “Network Development Engineer” roles at large companies like Amazon and was wondering if anyone here is in a similar role and can give me advice on what hiring managers are looking for. Do I need a computer science degree? I actually just started a journey to get a CS degree, but man is it time consuming(especially with a family), expensive, and a lot of math (four more math classes). Or would my time be better spent getting DEVNET Professional and maybe some cloud certs?

 Basically, something like a jason file that creates a desired server according to my specification quickly, without manually installing pieces, copy pasting configs, setting up user accounts, etc. I then simply keep track of this config file. 
 What software does that? Should I learn ansible?

 average tenure is 3-6 mths 
 some cowboys ( 1-2 senior admins with medium to high skill / age in IT but only worked at the place for 12 mths maybe 24) who play guessing games and have to discover the env as they go ( no up to date /accurate documentation ) fix stuff which break without telling the rest exactly how and also don’t document or share their knowledge 
 stuff keeps breaking - cowboys on leave or not available leaving juniors or newbies 
 Majority of Apps team and senior mgmt is very new too and clueless and just trying to outsource to solve the issues
 lots of politics /pushback between teams ( especially apps/infra/security )and finger pointing 
 only good thing is deep/wide /complex tech stack and playground as admins have full access to a whole stack.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So the question I have relates to Cisco Jabber. The User (or Users) can make calls from Jabber going from Jabber on his laptop to External company numbers. However they are not able to contact Internal company numbers.
 Naturally someone said it sounds like a routing issue. (Most of the company has Jabber working this is a new group being stood up working from vpns)
 User(who is on a vpn) can ping all the way into the Datacenter to the call manager server, I can ping from the switch the server is connected to, to the User PC. I can ping both directions from the Data Center Backbone switch. Routing seems to work. 
 ​
 So here's my thoughts. If they are able to talk to external numbers then the traffic has to go all the way into the datacenter anyways and hit the server before going back out again. Also from what I saw in emails of previous troubleshooting the Jabber Client on the PC is saying connected as far as registering with the server goes.
 (also for your knowledge I'm mainly from networking side of the house, we have a separate dept for the phone stuff so typically don't get too much into phone issues most of the time.)
 ​
 Jabber Outgoing - > External Number - Works
 Jabber Incoming<- External Number - Works
 Jabber Outgoing -> Internal Number - Not Work
 Jabber Incoming -> Internal Number - Not Work
 ​
 Any thoughts of what more to look into or questions I should ask?

 However, I'm also having issues at boot with iDRAC. Very similar to this post https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/cw7esz/idrac_initialization_error_on_poweredge_t420/ where fans are blowing at max speeds, the light at the back of the machine is flashing orange with the following error message:
  
Warning! iDRAC initialization error. Continuing to boot may yield unexpected power loss due to unknown power inventory and various features lost such as Remote Access, Active Power Management, Thermal Management, Inventory, LCD, or System Error Reporting. 
  
I guess my question is, do I have two separate issues going on here? Or is the iDRAC issue related to the missing raid controller. Just wondering if I purchase a replacement RAID controller am I going to still be stuck with more problems. This is my first Dell Server and have no experience with how iDRAC works.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been diddling around with influencing routes using BGP attributes in a multihomed environment with 2 network edge routers who both have connections to both ISP routers. 
 I looked in the OCG ENCOR book and it doesn't mention anything about how NAT would work in an environment like this. I imagine there's some way that 2 routers could share NAT translations but my Google skills are failing me. 
 What's considered best practice in a network like this?

 I tried cloudflare but my director has a dislike for their services as we need like 38 cname and MX entries.
 So my question is this who else offer an affordable DNS Hosting that can support the number of records we are pointing to our various services and sub domains.

It's running as a DC, a file server, and there's an Access database that clients access through some program installed on the workstations. There're two client workstations that can't have the program installed and so have to access the database directly on the server. Their previous IT set up RDS but never installed licenses; they just kept renewing the trial. We've had to fix a lot of how the previous IT did things and we are trying to get licensing for the two workstations that need to RDP into the server to access the database. I believe you can have the RDS session host and the RDS licensing manager on the same box, but correct me if I'm wrong. Can I use 2022 Server CALs for this situation or do I have to use Server 2016 CALs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow sysadmins,
 I'm looking for recommendations of and experiences with Linux antivirus options for on-premise company servers. We already use Symantec on our Windows servers and clients, and while it has a Linux version, it lags behind in supporting recent Linux distributions (e.g. Ubuntu 22.04) and it doesn't play nice with containers. We have a bunch of Ubuntu servers at various locations running QEMU/KVM virtualization, Docker (in VM), Kubernetes (nodes in VMs) und LXD containers (on bare metal) backed by local ZFS storage.
 We're looking for an option that is capable of dealing with containers, so that we'd only need to install the AV on hosts and VMs, and that offers sensible licensing/pricing, ideally per physical server instead of full price per install or at least reduced price for a VM install. Centralized management would be nice but not a requirement, log and/or mail based alerts would suffice. Needless to say we require good detection rates, timely signature updates and the capability to prevent the execution of malware. The main threat scenarios are malware getting on the servers either via compromised clients, exposed vulnerable services (hello Atlassian) or supply chain compromise (hello npm).
 The state of AV websites is a sad affair, with a general lack of clear statements about capabilities and business licensing options and costs (its all "Contact us!"), thus I turn to you.

 Left Switch: Vlan 10 computer, Vlan 20 computer, Vlan 10 computer
 (Connecting both Switches I have a trunk port configured in both Switches) 
 Right Switch: Vlan 30 computer, Vlan 20 computer, Vlan 20 computer, Router configured with subinterfaces for each Vlan (10,20,30), when "show ip route" shows everything allright
 So my problem is that I have configured everything exactly the same for each Vlan to make Router-On-A-Stick possible and it works, for example I can ping Vlan 30 computer to Vlan 20 computer or the opposite case but no computer on any Vlan can ping Vlan 10 and Vlan 10 can't ping the other Vlans. So what could be the problem? I swear to God I configured every Vlan in the same way and I have deleted the lab and started again several times and happens the same issue. Thanks in advance

I understand perhaps there's something different with the formatting of different data such as files or videos but on a digital level they're just a bunch of ones and zeros so why bother making different types?
 ​
 Also, I've tried cutting an ethernet cable in half and I can't seem to find any additional circuitry. All I saw was just a bunch of wires together. So what makes this ethernet cable different from a USB cable? Is there a circuit inside that I didn't see that processes or sends data differently?
 ​
 Also read that HDMI is better designed for sending media such as video, but why so? why is it better than a USB? Does it have some additional circuitry? If yes, what does it do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently anxious about a counteroffer I made today. So the job offered me $25 an hr which is $52K. I had the interview this past Monday-nailed my interview including the interview with the V.P. However, I made it clear that I had other interviews that week and could not formally respond until Friday. Another job offered me $28 or $56,160 a year. I called back Job A, recruiter was kind and asked me how my other interviews went. I said great and thanked him for being patient, I said another job offered $28 and wanted to see if they could match it. I stressed that I really wanted to work with them. He asked if I’d take anything lower so I said $27. This is about a $4K difference than their original offer. Normally I wouldn’t negotiate but I feel I’m the perfect person for the role-they actually sought me out from a job site-hounded me for about two weeks for an interview. They ended up offering me the role hours after my interview. My question is, did I screw up? If they reject my counteroffer, can I go back to their original offer? I didn’t make the counteroffer as a non-negotiable, I figured it wouldn’t hurt to ask. He said the latest I should be hearing back is early next week. I wouldn’t start this job until Nov 7, after my two weeks notice with my current company so the delayed acceptance is not an issue.

 Network: Comcast static IP on business cable modem not resolving MX record for verizon.net
 I am trying to resolve an MX record for verizon.net and it's failing with no records found.
 C:\Windows\system32>nslookup
 Default Server: HAL.xxx.local
 Address: x.x.x.x
 > set type=mx
 > verizon.net
 Server: HAL.xxx.local
 Address: x.x.x.x
 *** No mail exchange (MX) records available for verizon.net
 I have determined that this is happening on multiple cable based business comcast networks all with static IPs.
 If anyone can check and report back also? If so, no idea how or to whom to report this?It's fine on a Verizon static FIOS network and on a Comcast fiber network, and on a home Comcast cable network just not on a static cable based business Comcast network...
 And i also tried changing DNS servers within nslookup with the same result... so something is blocking MX resolution for verizon.net but just on Comcast business cable connections!?!
 If anyone else is experiencing this as a workaround i setup a send connector scoped for that one domain using smarthost:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 We use Symantec Email.Security Cloud. Yes, I know, Broadcom stuff. Don't ask about it.
 This week, Microsoft 365 just disabled Basic Auth from our tenant.
 So, if you are using Schemus (their sync tool) and syncing from Exchange Online (EXO), app passwords won't work anymore. 
 Worked with Broadcom's support. Surprinsingly, so far so good. 
 Support adviced to:
 - upgrade Schemus to latest downloadable version ( Schemus Synchronization Tool – Mandatory Upgrade (broadcom.com) ) and apply a support-supplied patch. This will enable Microsoft Graph as a source and enables usage of Exchange Online Cert-based auth.
 - Install Powershell 7.03+ plus EXO v3. If using Server 2012 R2 (like me...don't ask again) you need to create a config file so Schemus knows where to look for PoSh 7.
 - Configure an App Registration in Azure AD to allow to authenticate against EXO with a certificate (CBA, App-only authentication in Exchange Online PowerShell and Security & Compliance PowerShell | Microsoft Learn )
 - Reconfigure Schemus to use EXO CBA. 
 - And that's it...supposedly.
 Why supposedly? Well, seems like Schemus still uses EXO v1 "get-recipient" and that causes a timeout for us for just the "user" sync part (which is optional, but we use it). I managed to reproduce that error and compared against "get-EXOrecipient", which worked fine. Already told them that, so I guess we will have to wait for another patch from Broadcom's developer, Metanate (the one who develops Schemus).
 Hopefully this will help others who are stuck with Broadcom's stuff.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for some suggestions on what hardware to purchase for a firewall and switch. We are a small company and the budget is limited. We would prefer (though this is not essential) a single box and something that does not require subscriptions. One of the key requirements is that the stack has no single point of failure as we need to meet high uptime guarantees and so I am looking for something with a redundant power supply (I suppose 2 cheaper switches might be ok). We also need to be able to access the device management interfaces (iDRAC, IPMI) of devices on the internal network remotely and so need to have some facility to create a VPN (this seems preferable to a jump host). So, the requirements are: 1) Redundant power supply 2) Firewall 3) VPN 4) 10GbE minimum (SPF+ is preferred to RJ45) 5) <10 ports required
 Our main issue is that everything available that has redundant PSUs has 40+ ports and costs $$$. We only really need a single WAN port and 5 LAN ports (make that 10 to allow for expansion). Techbuyer have a useful product filter here: https://www.techbuyer.com/uk/catalog/category/view/s/network-switch-selector/id/482/ but all the results are switches with 40+ ports. Does anyone know of other product databases one can use or have any personal suggestions (including a different design utilising multiple boxes)? Any help much appreciated.

 So in the meantime, I'm looking for the simplest way to get a Mesh VPN network with the ASAs. Is this feasible? I can't find much on the topic. Or do I just wait and implement when we get new gear?

Don't need to be outdoor rated per se, will be indoors, just not a climate controller indoors, so harsh temperature/humidity exposure.
  
L2 only is fine
 at least 5 10/100/1000 PoE or PoE+ ports
 at least 2 SFP+ (might be able to compromise with SFP)
 AC powered preferred (no need for dual/redundant power)
  
Looking at the usual suspects, Mikrotik CSS610-8G-2S+IN looks like it might be a price winner, but only lists ambient temperatures and not operating temperatures? None of the Mikrotik outdoor-rated switches seem to check all the boxes. Aruba's rugged CX 4100i seems perfect on paper, anyone have experience they can share with those?
 Would also be open to older generation, used/refurbished units if it means I don't have to wait for any huge supply chain backlogs

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are working for multiple customers. Mostly we administrate some servers or databases for those (so we run Ansible, we connect to databases, replace certificates and such tasks). Every customer is sharing us a VPN – mostly personal accounts with 2FA, not a site-to-site or a general VPN account. This means that every new colleague is getting a new VPN account. Some VPNs require additional configurations (f.ex. setting routes/DNS manually), some not. And we have plenty of technologies: OpenVPN, L2TP/IPSec, FortiClient VPN, Cisco, …
 As some are using Linux, some Windows, some macOS – there are always troubles setting the VPN's up.
 We first started using OpenConnect, which supports a lot of different VPN services. But we had the problem that some configurations did not apply correctly and that some IDS systems detected this and it was forbidden by the IT.
 So: I'm looking for a way how my co-workers easily can connect to the different VPN's. I'm currently thinking of creating an RDS Server for each customer with everything preconfigured, authenticated by a certificate – or maybe something with Amazon WorkSpaces. But I think there must be a better solution to this.
 How do you handle this? Do you have an idea how we could gain some efficiency instead of a long on-boarding process and big documentations? It can be a technical solution, as we're mostly developers, system engineers or similar.
 Thank you in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I oversee a few campus networks where each campus currently has 1 subnet/network for voice and data that spans multiple buildings.
 I'd like to create a VLAN (200) specifically for the phones but use a unique subnet per building. This will allow us to tell the phone system if network = 1.0.1.0/24 use e911 number 555-555-0001.
 Building A (with the firewall) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.1.0/24
 Building B (uplinks to Building A) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.2.0/24
 Building C (uplinks to either Building A or B) VLAN 200 would be 1.0.3.0/24 
 Currently all Buildings have a 'data' VLAN (1) using the subnet 1.0.0.0/24 
 IIRC, this can be done via VLAN Mapping or Translation? Not something i've every used. Unfortunately, our HPE OfficeConnect (1820/1920 mostly) switches don't seem to support this. (I hate these switches) 
 My first thought was to create a VLAN on the firewall per building with a DHCP scope/relay and somehow convert that VLAN to the same phone vlan on the switch. However, I realized this isn't easily doable - I could connect two untagged ports together to accomplish this but, ew. 
 My next thought would be to utilize the switches to handle VLAN 200 and set up a DHCP relay (our switches won't act as DHCP servers (nor do i think i want to manage that..) I believe all of our switches are Layer 3 lite - allowing for routing. This would work but i'd have to let the voice traffic traverse the data network and add in routes on the firewall to point to each network switch.. it sounds messy. 
 Is there a solution that I'm not seeing to accomplish this? (Besides buying new switches lol)

 Later throughout the night, I had two more alerts come in around 1:45 and 3:00 AM that were short term disruptions that resolved themselves. In addition, I had two clients call in at 3:00 AM and then 5:00 AM about their VPN connection not operating. I missed these two calls, and my manager is furious with me because "that is what is expected of the on-call person."
 Is it reasonable to expect someone who receives alerts like this, respond to them throughout the night and be expected to start work at 8:00AM the next day and work a full 8-hour shift? Yes, we do get additional compensation for the week of being on call, but my thinking is that setting these expectations is what results in mistakes being made and on the job injuries. I'm not saying that you shouldn't work the next day but expecting someone to be up and running first thing and being sleep deprived is not a healthy thing.
 Am I wrong for thinking about it this way? What are your thoughts on this or what expectations does your company set?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Guys,
 I am going to be doing some wireless surveys pretty soon, and was looking to see if anyone had suggestions on building an AP on a stick cart? I have an AP, I have one of those standard two shelf utility carts, UPS, and a small PoE switch for power conversion. What I don't know is how I can get the height that I need to lift a pole up and down? My ceilings are going to be 10ft for the most part, so I don't think building something with static height will work very well.
 ​
 Thanks!

 Some of our users access another company's application, they use their email address and password from our sync'd AD.
 The thing is, their accounts all have expired passwords, yet they are still validated and can use this application.
 Should Microsoft not recognize its an expired password and deny access?
 If they log in locally on our domain they are prompted to change their password and can't login until they do - but this cloud app simply authenticates them.
 Friends, what am I missing?

 Does the fact that I have the VF in the function now mean that I am bypassing the host os networking stack and could theoretically achieve line performance or is there more I need to do? 
 I've done lots of research but I'm still pretty confused how this actually works. My current understanding is the network driver mounted into the kernel does the magic that means the standard network stack is avoided allowing the performance improvements, is this right?

 We have several Rukus Zoneflex R310 access points in our network, which was originally set up by a third party. I need to change the IP address for our access points which are currently on a 172.16 range. They need to be changed to a 192.168 range. However, whenever I enter the correct IP address to access the browser login page for the AP, I get a 503 service unavailable error. The IP address is definately correct and I have tried accessing it both wirelessly and through a physical connection via our LAN switch. Either way I'm getting the same 503 error and therefore can't make the necessary changes. 
 Any ideas? 
 Thank you in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically all the people who get paid more than they should at this company and think they are very important, are suddenly demanding I find a way to turn off 2FA on all their sites and services. Those here before me started the process of turning it on everywhere, and got stopped and canned for attempting it, even after getting the okay and explaining/communicating the process company-wide. They also want to make it so screens don't lock automatically, and want to use a single shared account for all the public workstations (meeting rooms and such) instead of logging in with their own account or bringing a laptop for presentations.
 Basically C-Suite says: I want all the computers to be unlocked and working before I get near them
 But my experience says: 2FA everything, lock every screen after 10-20 minutes of no activity, detect and disconnect mouse jigglers if needed, and always use unique accounts even at public kiosks
 This company is constantly under attack from phishing/spoofing and can't afford to pay for better M365 tiers to mitigate it. One of the IT Directors used the password Passwerd2020 a couple years ago, and the pen tester was able to use that account to find and access a full AD backup (don't have more detail on this, but it was bad).
 Seems they should be freaking out about how bad their security is, instead the execs are just trying to poke more convenience holes. Is there a psychological trick or some kind of magic words that get this through? Can I just say it's synergetic and get them to turn around? I'm not great at dealing with people who don't accept the truth and want to see IT as an obstruction.
 It's like having people say "It's really inconvenient, remove the deadbolts on my doors. The handle has a lock, why do I need two?" over and over.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to run a script to check complaince with switches. I got it working for the most part, but ran into a roadblock.
 My task I am trying to do now is to check is a specific ACL exists, and then to also verify it is placed on one of the vty lines. Normally, I would start by doing something like this....
 Output = net_connect.send_command ('show ip access-list') if "ACL NAME" in Output: print ('Compliant') else: print ('Not Compliant') 
 That works, but I also want to verify that it is place in the right location. So I could do another function like above to run a "show run | sec line vty" and verify that "ACL NAME" is in the Output. But that would be 2 different functions and 2 different print statements.
 Is there a way I can run both of those checks and have one print statement if they are both compliant?
 I was thinking I could do something like this....
 def check_acl(Output) if "ACL NAME" in Output: return True return False Output = net_connect.send_command ('show ip access-list') if check_acl(Output): print ('Compliant') else: print ('Not Compliant') 
 I was thinking I could do 2 def statements then have the function check for both def statements, but I am getting lost with that.
 Does anyone have any suggestions?
 Thanks

 Until I presented him with the laptop usage agreement. See, about a year ago, shortly after we added this client, we helped them draft Device Usage Agreements for users. 
 Pretty basic stuff. Date, Serial Number, condition issued, agreement for work purposes, cannot install/uninstall software, etc.
 Dude loses his absolute mind. Refuses to sign. Starts talking about how "No one is going to tell him what he can or can't do with his laptop!"
 Anyway, owner was walking by during the rant. Guy no longer has a job or a laptop. Owner is convinced they dodged a bullet.

 I am trying to start a new project where I need some devices which will be configured with OSPF and stacking or MLAG. So far I had setups with Cisco 6500 (no stacking here but dual supervisors), 2x Brocade ICX 6610 in stacking, 2x Dell 6224 in stacking. What I can say is that cisco and brocade were both extremely stable while dell had CPU usage issues along side other minor issues. Obviously all options I used so far are very old and I would like to try something new which consume less power.
 I was looking at Arista DCS-7050TX or Dell S4048-ON (I know there is a risk of Clock Signal failure, or was there?). Any suggestions or maybe different options? And yes I am sure these options are a bit older too but for this personal project I would go with something refurbished. Thank you :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm wondering if there is a way to prevent spoofing with a approved email list in office 365
 I want to make a rule that checks if an email is part of our exchange and if not than to reject the message. we are pretty small only about 80 email users spread between 3 buildings. we never get hit with spoofed email of real people in our company but we always get hit with spoofed emails of our domain with a fake person and our users get tricked into giving info because they think this is someone new at a different building.
 I know I can do this in exchange rules but I would always need to add a new user to the approved list\ Group every time a new person is hired. I want it to be automatic when a user is created.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[some time ago i decided to change jobs in a hope to get some motivation back (I was working night-shift in a medium sized enterprise). 
 i now got a job in a tech startup (30+ employees 70 R&D) I have never worked in a start up before and most of my experience has been from larger organizations or enterprises. 
 Before i joined the company all systems administration has been done by DevOps and the CISO, so most if not all systems have never been setup properly, lots of software or other systems are still running trial versions that in some cases are expired with limited functionality. every day is a new challenge to just maintain a proper production. 
 I am hired as the IT systems administrator, so everything with IT, user management, Governance, risk and compliance falls under my scope. 
 With this whole mess that i am trying to balance I am slowly starting to lose my mind, and my motivation is long gone. 
 How do you keep the motivation up?
 it has been so bad for me that i have even considered if i should start working in a completely different line of work (oh yeah, I applied for a job in the local Lidl because the benefits are better then what i get now) 
 I actually don't expect any replies, just needed to get this off my chest

 So we have had an Android developer inform us that they were trying to use Android Studio with emulated (enrolled) devices but when trying to use certain features that require "Verify Apps over USB" to be disabled they can't. When I looked at their device it shows that it is enabled and the config profile assigned is the same as the one on my test device.
 What is weird is that my device shows as disabled, we have the exact same config profile assigned and all I can see is that the developer options settings is allowed from the list of settings.
 Anyone know where this setting sits or is named under in android config profile settings.
 Thanks

 We can reproduce the issue regularly by going onto a network that doesn't have permission to the print serve, open word, and edit margins. Word then locks up while searching for the printer (which it can't find the default printer because they are not on the VPN or Network with permission to the printer). Eventually times out and seems to remember the time out for that session of word. It does cause other delays also
 Others are saying they get around it by setting a default printer to the local PDF writer but that isn't really the best option. 
 It seems office is trying to connect to get the page setup information from the printer. Is there a setting somewhere to change this behavior. We are kind of stumped at the moment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Saw the post about the HR person who had to feel what we go through all the time. It really got me thinking about all the abuse I've had to deal with over the past 20-odd years. Fellow employees yelling over the phone about tickets that aren't even in your queue. Long nights migrating servers or rewiring entire buildings, come in after zero sleep for "one tiny thing" and still get chewed out by the Executive's assistant about it. Ask someone to follow a process and make a ticket before grabbing me in a hallway and you'd think I killed their cat.
 Our pay scales are out of wack, every company is just looking to undercut IT salaries because we "make too much". So no one talks about it except on Glassdoor because we don't want to find out the guy who barely does anything makes 10x my salary.
 Our responsibilities are usually not clearly defined, training is on our own time, unpaid overtime is 'normal', and we have to take abuse from many sides. "Other duties as needed" doesn't mean I know how to fix the HVAC.
 Would a Worker's Union be beneficial to SysAdmins/DevOps/IT/IS? Why or why not?
 I'm sorry if this is a stupid question. I guess I kind of wanted to vent. Have an awesome Read-Only Friday everyone.

 Before I tell the user again that IE11 is (currently) PART OF Win10, and trying to install IE3.0 or IE 3.0 libraries for active X doesn't make any sense - I'm doing a sanity check. How likely is this to break the Win 10 install if it'll even install at all?

 I’m posting here because i’m a bit lost and I don’t know what to do with my career. I’m a network engineer currently working in the banking industry. Currently I work a lot on campus networking and especially Wifi (Cisco and Aruba) and NAC stuff (mostly ISE), but I’m one of the few in the team which is able to work on almost every perimeter (LAN, WIFI, Automation, Routing, Security).
 Right now I don’t really know what would be best for my career, I could dig more in WIFI for exemple and become a specialist in one of those field or keep being a « jack of all trade master of none ». But i’m always afraid by choosing to become a specialist on a field, WiFi, i’m closing myself some doors and be less futur proof in my career.
 So I’m interested from your experience what do you think would be best to do ?
 Thanks a lot

 If I replace it with a short cable it works fine, so it is definitely the cable.
 Not sure if it's a dodgy cable or if I am getting lots of electromagnetic interference.
 Should I buy a shielded cable? or perhaps a cat 7. or is there some way to make linux run on a more unstable connecton since windows seems fine with it.

But people still reported issues which I isolated to Google Calendar invites. So I set up DKIM for Gmail and go the DNS provider to add that TX record. 
 After enabling authentication, I'm finding the "Sending email" dialog in Thunderbird on my laptop sat there for ages before sending. Sending email from the GMail web UI didn't do this. Now, some ten minutes or so later, I tried again from Thunderbird and there was a flicker of a pause, but nothing like before. So I'm hoping the initial long delays were just because the DNS changes were propagating. Can I hope this is the case? Can anyone verify that just after enabling DKIM, a pause sending emails is expected and is due to DNS which will ease over the next 24-48 hours?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, of course it's DNS....
 I've got one server (Windows Server 2022 VM on Nutanix AHV) that's having problems doing DNS lookups. Not consistently, it can usually ping the DCs in its domain and in the forest root above it. But the lookups tend to be slow. And many other servers in the domain don't resolve.
 I've done a netsh winsock reset and a reboot, which I thought fixed it (I could resolve a hostname that wasn't previously working) but just seems to have made it a little better, not fixed it altogether. I've removed the virtual NIC and put a new one in. I've switched temporarily to DHCP. The issue persists. It's using the two domain controllers as DNS servers, the same as every other server in that domain, and they're all fine.
 "Test-Netconnection DC1 -p 53" connects successfully (as does DC2).
 If I do an nslookup for anything, it finds it. But if I immediately ping it, chances are, it won't resolve the name.
 Name resolution fails regardless of whether I just search for the NETBIOS name or the FQDN. I've tried putting a random dot at the end of both as per some ancient article I found on Google, but that doesn't work either.
 This server has just gone live to the whole business, so I really don't want to rebuild it if I can avoid it, but I'll try most non-destructive things out of hours. I've got good backups of it but I don't really know when this started.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all
 I'm looking for ways to centrally manage access to customer, and internal servers. Servers are 95% accessed by RDP, if not, TeamViewer.
 Some customers we've got shared admin credentials to, others we've got personal credentials on, and we'll need to be able to use both - with personal ones only known to the individual user.
 Today we're using Royal TS and managing document (RDP/gateway/credential folder) access with Azure Security Groups -> AADDS Security Groups.
 We're a Windows house, fully onboard with Azure, with all that it entails.
 ​
 Need to have:
  
Centrally managed access controle. This can happen any which way, fx via Security Groups.
 
Logging. Access log is a must have.
 
Automated emergency access.
 
Azure Active Directory, or Azure Active Directory Domain Services integration.
 
Windows and Mac support.
 
Helpful vendor support.
 
Session recording.
 
GDPR compliant. 
 
Admin and user rights.
 
 ​
 Nice to have:
  
PIM/PAM support.
 
Password management from the same vendor - for passwords not related to the servers.
 
PowerShell manageable if applicable (it's nice not to have to go through every single setup point, for hundreds of customers).
 
Auditing for GDPR (if applicable).
 
 ​
 If PAM is included, I'm looking for cheaper alternatives than Delinia/Thycotic and Cyberark. (Though if a good price can be provided, they're in the loop)

 Set the "Logon Options" to "Automatic logon with current username and password".
 I have disabled "Prompt for credentials on the client computer".
 I have deployed the "Use Locally logged-on credentials".
 I have specified the SHA1 thumbprint as trusted RDP publisher from the Connection Broker certificate.
 In both Edge(Chromium) and Internet Explorer the SSO works for the urls needed.
 https://rdweb.company.local/RDWeb
 https://rdweb.company.local/RDWeb/Feed/webfeed.aspx
 But when i try to add the url in the "RemoteApp andf Remote Desktop Connections" under controlpanel it says "Incorrect username or password", this makes the auto deployment of the url impossible.
 Is there a setting i have forgotten to set or is this a lost cause?

 A really strange but replicable issue has arised.
 When a user forwards an email in the ios outlook app that contains pictures (such as a logo in the signature or inline images) ALL images in the email (including previous mails in the same email) become one of the images. 
 This only happens if you select "Expand previous mesasge" (rough translation, sorry) during the forward. You can see that all images gets turned inte one of the images in the "edit-mode" but that is not necessarily the same one that gets sent.
 We have the lates ios outlook and ios 16.03
 Have you seen anything like this?
 To try it yourself: 
  
Open an email with pictures 
 
Select Forward
 
Click "Expand Message" / "Show full message"
 
All the images gets turned into one of the pictures
 
 Optional:
  
Send the email
 
All the images could turn into one of the other images in the mail

 I'm looking to get a new UPS for our office as the current one is essentially a very heavy paper weight. 
 I'm not looking to spend loads and really only need enough backup time to shut everything down safely (5-10 minutes max).
 The equipment I have is below:
 Watchguard M270: 75W
 US-48-500W: 500W x 2
 UAP-AC-Pro: 9W x 3
 Poweredge R320: 350W x 2
 HP Microserver: 200W 
 Total: 2002W 
 Preferably I'd like it under £1000 but could stretch to perhaps £1250-1500 if really required.
 Thank you in advance!

 Existing gear in IDF1 was a Cisco 2960x with 1gig link back to MDF (Meraki ms425).
 Upgraded IDF1 to Meraki ms225 and new 10gig MMF SFP last night. Had issues trying to get the fiber link up. Tried rolling fiber at IDF. Tried rolling fiber at MDF. Tried different patch cable at IDF side. Now what worked was rolling at BOTH sides. Once that link came up (and at 10gig), I was like - that doesn't make sense so we tested and rolled them both back and tried all other combinations, fail.
 Fast forward to tonight. Same site, different IDF, same MDF switch. Link wouldn't come up after new gear was in. I said let's roll both sides at the same time. Link came up. What the hell?
 The only thing I can think of is - at the MDF side, fiber patch cables are orange, but there's about a foot of distance leading starting at its LC connector where ONE of the strands turns yellow. Where it transitions orange, there's about 2 inches of some sort of shrink wrap and the cable gets slightly bulkier there. The other strand is orange the whole way. It looks factory made. I haven't been able to find an image of those online. 
 Who know what's going on here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear fellow Sysadmins,
 I've been working at an old fashioned (small and rather niche) MSP for the last 10 years and will soon make the move to a well-known and bigger company. With a good bump to my salary. As smaller MSPs are, I've got a rather broad spectrum of skills but I am no master in a lot of those. Well, that may be knocking myself a bit down, but you get the gist.
 My new employer put me into a department that will also be focused on providing managed services with some focus on cloudy stuff as well as even providing private cloud instances to customers. I am destined to be a network-guy (but it could change to something else if it fits, I am pretty open to other positions), which fits the focus of my previous position, but with a lot of focus to newer technologies like software defined networking / SD-WAN and the like which I have pretty much no clue about. (Well, I setup a vxlan peering on my proxmox-homelab-cluster and connected three VMs with it, but that's about it :-D)
 I guess I made a good impression and I was pretty honest about this lack of knowledge on my part, so there will probably be provided training at the start and I will not be expected to have this knowledge. I think I showed enough willingness to learn new stuff and general interest in IT to be a future asset to my employer.
 Be that as it may, tldr, I'd love to read up and learn about the newer network-concepts like SDN/SD-WAN and stuff in this direction but I am not sure where to start exactly. Can someone point me in the right direction? Or maybe recommend some good papers/videos about this stuff? I'd like not to focus on a specific manufacturer, but if they provide good content I don't mind.

 Problem 8(using link): I know that the window size is how many frames it can transfer at a time. 
 In this scenario, the first 3 frames are sent, and B would have to send an acknowledgement that it received frame 1. The last bit of the first frame arrives at B in 20 msec and therefore, 30 msec after the frame transmission begins. 
 How I interpret it:
  
Frame 1 takes 10 msec to arrive from A to B
 I don't understand "The last bit of the first frame arrives at B in 20 msec, and therefore, 30 msec" Are we still talking about frame 1? 
  
​
 This is the diagram i've written to help me understand it:
  
I have 10 frames(10 boxes)
 A sender with vert line, and B is receiver with vert line: frames 1,2,3 are sent.
 Frame 1 takes 10 msec to transmit from A to B
 Frame 2 takes 10 msec after frame A is transmitted to transmit from A to B
 Frame 3 takes 10 msec after frame B is transmitted to transmit from A to B
 3 frames fill up the window, so receiver has to send out an acknowledgement that it received frame 1. Window slides, and A is able to send another frame to B, then B sends acknowledgement again and it repeats. 
  
The bullet point I bolded is what I am struggling with. My teacher has tried explaining this to me, but I'm not grasping that way of interpreting it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I work for a MSP and we're thinking of trying to replace some Cisco VDSL modems with the Proscend VDSL2 SFP, just trying to wrap my head around the potential configurations that we might use for this.
 Our current plan is to stick the SFP into the switch for the clients (Most clients only have 1-2 switches, generally a Cisco of some sort, 24-48 ports with 2-4 SFP ports.) and then setting one single SFP and one single RJ45 port into their own VLAN and using that to bridge the SFP Modem with WAN interface on the router. However, for the router to connect to the ISP over this SFP modem, it requires tagging a VLAN on the WAN interface.
 If we were to set the SFP and RJ45 ports to access ports to some random VLAN - e.g. 2000, and then set the router to tag VLAN2 on the WAN port, would the switch see the VLAN2 tag on these access ports and then just strip the VLAN tag?
 One of our other options is just a SFP to RJ45 media converter, but then that requires extra plugs, and an extra point if failure, not to mention more cost rather than just plugging the SFP into a switch and partitioning the switch out, not as costly as a router but a cost that the client would need to bear.
 Alternatively, we could just upgrade all of our clients to routers with SFP ports, but then we're going to need to convince the clients to put the money in to upgrade their routers in the cases where they don't already have routers with SFP ports.
 Any opinions on the best way forward while still being cost efficient?
 Thanks all!

 We have a MS CA but we also have the ability to grab a third party cert. There are about 10 people that will need to be able to sign. We use yubikeys so we have the ability to leverage them. 
 Anyone else do this in a small dev team with no code being sent externally? To be honest I've never dabbled with code signing before and most info is for Dev firms and large companies needing a lot of people to do it..

Currently, it's a flat network 192.168.1.1 /24 with our 48 port switch on eth1 port of ubiquiti edgerouter 4. The switch has multiple desktops(~10) and printers connecting to some win servers (setup as a terminal server). The voip phones would be added at each station sitting in front of the respective desktop on the same line. In order to power the phones, a second poe switch will be added as well.
  
 1) Firstly, should I be plugging one switch into another daisy chain style so the phones can see the SBC controller I've setup on the win server? In doing so, all uplink data will be running through a single shared 1GB line which is not great but it's only 10 u…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey folks, I maintain a small coaxial cable TV plant for a campus with a few dormitory buildings (about 400 rooms total). It's really simple with the CATV headend (digital QAM modulator) and we pipe in our licensed channels to it in addition to a few in house channels for signage and information. We're making a new dormitory that will be all ethernet and no coax to the room to use simple digital CATV enabled TVs. 
 It appears the hospitality IPTV market is large from fancy ones that have splash pages that welcome you with customized information to your room. I do notice that at the hotels a lot of them have set top boxes behind the hospitality TV and this seems complex. I feel like buying hospitality grade smart TVs will lock us in or perhaps the set top box is the way to go? How much do these systems cost to maintain and license? is it even worth it?
 I really like the simplicity of coax CATV, just scan for new channels (the channel plan rarely changes) and go, so I can just push to get coax installed in the new dorm to each room and extend CATV to the dorm with HFC fiber. Change my mind?
 One possible driving factor for IPTV is to also allow users to watch IPTV on their desktop or mobile devices. I can technically hit the multicast IP on the distribution side (source to QAM modulator) and watch it in VLC but it's not too user friendly. I don't know how many users would actually watch our channels on mobile. I have tested Haivison's HMP product and have always wondered if there are competition products to this. Is there anything open source in this space at all?

It is giving esoteric errors that the MSP says DATTO says are due to a corrupted disk. The whole ordeal has been dragging out over weeks and I'm basically 
 "can i replace the disk?" no answer to that question.... 
 "can they check the disk" "ok we'll ask them....". Two days later I finally get a response that the disk is fine... but something is wrong with the (out of warranty) device. They want me to sign a new 3 year agreement and they'll give me a free box (I'm on the cusp of not wanting to work with this MSP anymore so a commitment is not high on my list!). But they also increase the rate by about 30% - which seems extravagant. I hate not being backed up and I'm pretty angry at myself for not getting VEAMM community up and running as part of my 2 onsite backup system. 
 I haven't had offsite replication in over two weeks. I'm unsure if my onsite/on-device backups are good or not. My SQL server backups are backing up to the attached NAS share without error, so... i guess those are ok... but they're not offsite. After weeks of no backup I'm ready to sign fucking anything, but such a strong increase sounds like a ball twist. 
 Is DATTO, now owned by kaseya (mind you, DATTO saved me from ransomware that a Kaseya server distributed so... fuck Kaseya and I'm extremely sad that they purchased DATTO), jacking up prices? Or is my MSP taking me for a ride? A $2000increase on top of an already expensive service is pretty fucking harsh, in my opinion.

 If I could use Ubiquiti I would choose USW-Pro-Aggregation.
 If I could use Cisco I would choose Nexus 3064.

 Not really fond of MikroTik but I'm not even sure if they offer anything around what I'm looking for.
 Any other ideas? Switch can be used, it doesn't need to be brand new (so I allow older EoLed models).
 Would be great if anyone could post models that I can look for and which definitely not even consider.

 The VLAN these IPs belong to only exists on this switch and is not allowed on any trunks. I have also crosschecked the access ports assigned to the VLAN and confirmed that none of them have any of these IPs. While there is obviously reference to the network these IPs belong to in the config there are no direct references to them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a client who has a PtP setup with Unifi NanoBeam 5AC's between their home and an event area about 900 feet away, distanced is reported by the Unifi device. At the home I get about 700 Mbps on wired LAN with speed test at fast.com. When I plug my computer in to the end of the PtP link at the event area, I get about 190 Mbps down and 180 Mbps up after the speed test. Event area is at the other end of a farm area so as far as I know, no electrical/wireless interference in the path.
 The speeds are more than enough for what is needed at the event area but the client wants to expand internet to a barn that has line of sight with the event area, it is about 1400 feet away (distanced is reported by the Unifi device). The barn will then have a PtMP that aims to 3 homes. I would include an aerial view but I can't share images here.
 My concerns are as follows:
  
How can I increase bandwidth between home and event area so that the barn and 3 homes can also benefit from the Internet circuit? What stats do I need to review and settings to tweak to try to increase bandwidth to near theoretical max throughput?
 If the home reaches consistently 700 Mbps, what is the max I should expect after the first PtP hop?
  
Do you have any specific resources I can read or watch to have a better understanding on how to optimize the wireless links?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we've been dealing with some issues regarding Spectrum speeds/reliability for awhile now. We're being charged $400 a month for the 50x50 line itself (In the city), along with additional costs for things like a managed firewall. We've had stability issues quite frequently in the past with this line, but the stability seems to be better now. 
 50mb/s is not meeting our needs though. I understand the high cost is to guarantee these minimum speeds, though our speeds don't seem to really ever go above that. A shared line could give us 20 times the speeds for a quarter of the price. I would think that the 50mb/s is a minimum amount of bandwidth we'd get, shouldn't we still be able to get higher speeds despite them not being guaranteed? Or are we being capped at that 50mb mark? It seems like that 50mb/s minimum is our maximum, which seems a bit absurd. I'm not really sure if we're being throttled at that bandwidth. 
 If spectrum doesn't throttle dedicated lines at their guaranteed speeds, I suppose another cause may be the managed firewall that we have with them. It seems to be an older model, and from my knowledge it is performing tasks like Deep Packet Inspection. 
 We also use a shared building, with 2 other tenants in it. By paying for a dedicated line, would the other tenants in the building be using that line? From the agreement we signed, it looks like there are 3 address entries with the same address, so it seems plausible that we may not be getting that dedicated access, and that this may be a cost we should talk to the landlord about. 
 These are the theories I've come up with so far. I understand the value/cost associated with getting dedicated speeds, but it seems like we're pretty much being limited at these speeds. Any help is appreciated!

 I know that with Windows 10 and later you can just plug in a hard drive into any computer and it will re-adjust to new hardware and boot but with older Windows operating systems it will just blue screen because you will have to sysprep it first to be able to move it to another machine. But I can't boot this device anymore to sysprep it.
 What are my options to revive this operating system into another machine?

VLAN 1
 VLAN 2
 VLAN 3 and so on.
 
 Traffic for the special VLAN can interact and all. For the sake of this post, this traffic all occurs on 13.10.5.0 / 255.255.0.0. Any traffic in this network ID should be able to communicate only on this VLAN and outside (e.g. 192.168.5.0 cannot access this traffic).
  
VLAN 20 (Limited Traffic hidden from other VLAN's)
 
 As it stands now I can hit the 13.10.5.0 traffic from 192.168.5.0 .

 seems to have fixed issues related to office apps / teams / network dropouts
 been battling these issues for months, and only in the last 24 hours I've tried uninstalling this app and it seems to have helped a lot of my users.
 fingers crossed this is the permanent fix.
 ​
 EDIT: lots of people saying "image/MDT ur endpoints"... These laptops are sent straight from vendor and are pushed via azure autopilot/Intune. This isn't uncommon for larger enterprises. Manufacturer's drivers still end up on these machines even though they are specced for our org,, this scenario is just different to what you'd see if you have the opportunity to get hands on with every single laptop you order.
 EDIT #2: removed some snarkiness from my initial edit. It was a long day, sorry 🙂
 EDIT #3: if this is helping you, u/SpongederpSquarefab pointed out that "Annoyling Dell Command installs Dell Optimizer lol". Important to note.

 I am having an issue with my HP ProCurve 2510s, they are randomly shutting down the interfaces which go back to my router and the event log states that a loop was detected and the port was shut down, but im not sure where the loop actually is.
 This is my config:
 Checkpoint 1450 Appliance (Router & FW)
 Multiple Port-Based VLANS, EG 10.0.70.0/24, 10.1.70.0/24 etc you get the idea. These are not tagged vlans. 
 Switch 1 (one dropping ports)
 The switch is configured to have untagged uplinks back to the checkpoint appliance. These links randomly drop for network loops being detected, but there is no logs on the checkpoint to suggest a network loop was detected either. The uplink to my other switch (100mbps half duplex) does not drop, but these are tagged vlans. No ports on the other 2510 drop either
 Each Port-Based vlan has its own IP (EG 10.0.70.1, 10.0.70.2 etc)
 im genuinely unsure where to look next in finding this network loop
 any help will be appreciated, i can share configs if required

 What happens with smartphones and tablets that promiscuously share wifi PSK-personal keys? Do they also attempt to share IPSK? 
 I see the Cisco implementation can tie it to a MAC address but these are also easily copied, so it seems like IPSK still has the potential to be widely shared and used by unauthorized devices.
 Probably a more important question is if there is some way for a wifi network to tell the clients, do not share our PSKs with other devices.

 Basic auth is gone for Exchange online, which isn't an issue for Windows or Mac users, but for our wonderful Linux userbase this is getting quite problematic it seems. 
 Microsoft is saying use an OAuth app to authenticate via IMAP/POP/SMTP.
 I am not new to OAuth app integrations, but this is a bit out of my league, and I have quite some concerns: 
  
It is saying to give "application" level access for IMAP and POP - not delegated
 It is saying to give the service principal for that specific application access to a specific Mailbox
  
Now this combination makes me think that I need to create a unique App integration for each linux user and assign this unique service principal to the users mailbox? 
 I cannot create one App integration with one secret, which I give to every linux user, and then assign the service principal to each of their mailboxes, each linux user can access every linux users mailbox?
 I don't really see an easy solution for this mess, how are you doing this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have two edge SRX1500 firewalls, that I am replacing old cisco routers and firewalls with. My problem is just figuring out the failover situation during an ISP failover without using an edge switch or routers.
 Basically ISP1 would connect to the active SRX and ISP2 would connect to the passive SRX. My goal is to have it failover to the Passive SRX and ISP2, if ISP1 is down (i.e bgp down, link down etc...). I am thinking IP monitoring would be best for this situation. But I wanted to see if someone here has done something like this that maybe has a better way of doing it or if I am missing something?
 ​
 Other questions:
  
With an active/passive cluster, anything connected to the passive SRX never passes traffic, so presumably the BGP session with ISP2 would never come up until a failover occurs, correct? 
 With IP monitoring, if I wanted to fail back to ISP1 I presume that has to be done manually?

 As a side quest, what other sites are out there that give you the ability to easily store an offline copy that you update every few weeks?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi thanks for clicking.
 My issue is that I have a NAT map table setup but my IP routes are not following said map. Instead of the internal IP using the statically mapped external IP, it is using the "dynamic NAT". There is no way to disable Dynamic NAT and it's not even a range of IPs it a singular "dynamic NAT" IP. I believe this is the cause of said dynamic NAT IP being block listed since I am trying to send out newsletters. How can I get my IP routes to follow my NAT map properly?
 I've been one the phone with my ISP and they've told me they cannot disable this dynamic NAT and that they really don't even have anymore control than I do.

 ​
 Since then the radius hasnt worked. gives an error message of 
 "An Access-Request message was received from RADIUS client 10.3.0.231 with a Message-Authenticator attribute that is not valid."
 ​
 This is on a windows 2012 server on latest october updates. Originally the merakis were on dhcp so the ip changed, which i assumed the issue was, changed and didnt work. changed the shared key incase it was wrong, didnt work, turned off needs to containg authenticator attrible ... still nothing.

 Any suggestions

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've got one user at one client that, starting yesterday, is getting hammered with spam, but it's not your typical viagra or porn spam. They're getting signed up to hundreds of different websites, lots of different languages, mostly european, some asian, lots of dutch, german and polish, and we're getting all the account creation emails. Obviously they're on a list somewhere that got sold, but wondered if there some sort of new wordpress form or other vulnerability that's being exploited. Whatever bot it is, seems to hit a website multiple times; whatever it's filling out in the forms for a name is random characters as some of those forms copy back that data to the email.
 Blocking some of it with geoip policies, some with language polices, but it's hardly making a dent. We're using barracuda. I can't find any commonality in the headers other than some have references to a php mailer in the xheaders, but that's not nearly enough to fingerprint on to block.
 Told the user that if it doesn't settle down in a couple of days, we may have to dump his current email to a group and get him a new address.
 Anyone seeing similar or know the source? Better yet, have some sort of magic regex that catches all of it?

 I would like to build a preproduction environment completely isolated from my production env.
 I'm looking at the best way to do it.
 Of course I would like to build something that is fully replicated from my prod. 
 Right now my production Vms are hosted in a vcenter.
 My company does alreay have a lab vcenter and we would like to clone the prod Vms into this lab vcenter.
 We don't have the entreprise license of vmware, so the crossed vcenter functionnality is not available. 
 My question is more about how am I supposed to replicate the production ? 
 I can use cron with rsync or ansible to transfer files from the prod to the lab but I'm wondering if there isn't a better solution ? 
 Do you guys have any feedback on how to build a pre production environment, fully replicated with the production servers ?

Google meet obviously for the google meetings, Apple TV for mirroring the iPads when nobody is joining remotely, and the PC for all other meeting solutions that don't work with Google Meet. Since it's budget time we're looking for an all-in-one solution for joining meetings and the Smart board 6000s Pro seems like a pretty legit solution but I just don't know anybody who's actually used it. According to the product page it can join all of the major video conferencing platforms, and supports AirPlay mirroring, so it would wipe out all of the extra we have and users wouldn't have to change much. Does it have a lot of hardware compatibility in terms of webcams? Is it easy for users to use? Does it give a good experience when using it on all of the different meeting platforms? Anything I'm not thinking of?

 I've created this PS script to check on something in Citrix, but I don't know how to get it to email via our internal SMTP server, I'm tried a few examples via Google.
 The PS is:
 $obj = Get-BrokerDesktopGroup | Where-Object PublishedName -eq GSelector_W10 | Select-Object TotalDesktops, DesktopsAvailable, DesktopsInUse, Sessions, DesktopsUnregistered, DesktopsDisconnected, DesktopsFaulted, DesktopsPreparing If (($obj.DesktopsAvailable -eq 0) -or ($obj.TotalDesktops -eq 0)) { Send-MailMessage -From citrix-alert@domain.com -to me@domain.com -subject "Test Email" -body "Test message" -smtpserver smtpinternal.domain.com -port 25 } 
 Nothing arrives.
 However I was also trying to add the other values from the PS script so the body of the email message is something like:
  TotalDesktops = DesktopsAvailable = DesktopsInUse = Sessions = DesktopsUnregistered = DesktopsDisconnected = DesktopsFaulted = DesktopsPreparing = 
 Is this possible? I'm getting a little lost.
 Thanks

 This is a two part question. First part neccessary, in second topic I am not so sure about.
 Has anybody scripted to check for new updates, when found, do download and export to share? Later Dell servers iDRAC-s will check the share and upgrade its firmwares (BIOS, iDRAC) without reboot. 
 Once a month or so when operating systems get updates, servers will be rebooted automatically and upgraded firmwares will be in use. Do I dare to automate many server reboots in a mentioned way at once and soon possibly find out that many servers are not booting in case of firmware bug or something like that?

 So I am trying to solve a very annoying issue that users are starting to notice and while I am aware this probably should go to the r/office365 section I am more interested to see if sysadmins have seen this and if they have, how did you solve it?
 Basically the users would be working in Outlook with calendars open capturing meetings and the like. When changing from one day to the next at one point Outlook will not draw the bottom part of the calendar and wherever you click Outlook will click that amount of cells not rendered up or down. See screenshot for the example, I clicked in the blank space but the selection was above my click. https://imgur.com/a/KxOkHv6
 Initially I thought this was an Azure Virtual Machine issue but I have since been able to recreate it on a physical machine as well. I have tried the latest Office beta but the issue persists. I have reinstalled Office, recreated the profile, used Online only mode, tried the reg key to disable hardware acceleration, tried different hardware, tried different accounts. At this point I don't know what else to try and suspect it is a flaw in Office because I have seen this with a different user who has reproduced it in Excel workbooks that have formulas that changes the display while it is running.
 I have a open ticket with MS on this but I thought I would ask here as well. Anyone else seen this before? If so how did you solve it?

 I was checking a few mesh devices but all of them had this connection up to x number of devices.
 My question is, can we increase the number of devices that can be connected by increasing the number of APs in a mesh? (Assuming interference is not a problem)
 I checked Tp-link Deco XE75.
 Tp-link has written that it supports 200 devices but has not clarified that 200 in mesh or per AP.
 And if per AP, Does that mean 3AP = 600 devices in mesh?
 Thank you.

 There isn't direct access to the VPC so I'm using a proxy command in my SSH config using AWS session manager to access it. Connecting via SSH works fine but now I'm trying to tunnel on top of that to hit the web server and I'm hitting a wall.
 My current SSH config looks something like ... And it allows me to SSH to the instance
 Host i-* IndentityFile ~important.pem User ec2-user UserKnownHostsfike /dev/null ServerKeepAlive 60 ProxyCommand sh -c "aws ssm start-session --target &h --document-name AWS-StartSSHSession --parameters 'portNumber=%p'"
 I've tried adding a Dynamic forward and and tweaking my browser to use that as the proxy but no dice
 Anyone got any ideas? I'm stumped

 In this first phase they will only use this for halloween. They want to play a short movie/gif to wish users a happy halloween. So this is static on a specific date/for every user.
 With GPO I can create a taskschd for this.
 Does anyone know a program or something like that (lightweight ofcourse) to perform this task? Eg: a media player that starts immediate full screen and exit/quit automatically for example.
 Thanks for giving me tips in this "nice" task ;-)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have an app similar to TikTok, so the media being served is mainly videos. We are adding a CDN now to both, reduce the costs and make the loading faster (Google Cloud CDN), and are not sure how to configure it.
  
Cache static content vs Force cache all content. I think we will go with foce all content since we want all content to be cached.
 Client time to live: I see no reason to refresh the media ever. The videos cannot be changed by the users. Once uploaded they can just delete the post or keep it. So I see no reason to have such time to live at all. We would just set it to 1 year as that is the maximum time to select. Is that the right choice?
 Custom response headers and Negative Caching Policy: Do we need this at the beginning? Or should we just consider it later to further improve things?

 - 2 PC hangs in the first 24h.
 - Snipping tool --> Print, attempts to open a print dialog then disappears without doing nothing.
 - Copy that same picture and paste into notepad --> Print. Stays "printing" forever but it doesn't print.
 - Printers --> [Select printer] --> Open queue --> "You need an app to open ms-print-queue". Going "shell:::{A8A91A66-3A7D-4424-8D24-04E180695C7A}", print queue opens fine. Test page from the printer prints no issues.
 - Run ESET installer --> "Do you want to look for the app in the Store?" instead of just installing. Even selecting "Yes", it throws an error.
 Everything above wasn't happening 24h ago with W10. Dear Microsoft, if the product is not ready, DON'T RELEASE IT.
 I'm sorry, but needed that rant.

 I'm not allowed to just jank the time several hours leaving overlaps or gaps in the timestamps. So I have to be very gentle.
 What is a good way to very slowly correct the time over a few days, weeks even. Adjust a minute every hour or something like that.

 We have since last week, blue screens on 3 platforms / Microsoft Surface - HP laptop - HP desktop
 People can connect to their session but when it finishes to load, they have a blue screen, this can happens 3/4 times in a row when users restart before they can use their computer.
 The errors are either Kernel Failure or Driver failure.
 We deploy our OS (Win10 21h2) with sccm.
 We are trying to find what is happening, we looked into event logs, updated drivers and firmware, forced Windows Update but it keeps happening. We have quite a few GPO at logon and some script at startup but nothing was changed these past 2 weeks. We don't understand why we get these blue screens like that.
 Do you have any other ideas for this ?

I asked why not just drop spectrum and go full AT&T he explained he saw an article in 2020 saying companies should have isp redundancy in case of outages. I don’t see how this wouldn’t do anything but cause a potential headache trying to trunk and manage seperate isps. Any thoughts on this?

 Just want to get ideas and best practices to achieve this. Essentially in the case that there are multiple branches and each branch has to pay/communicate with a vendors etc.
 Management wants to say create a PayPal account per branch. Is it best to create an entire new email for the branch specifically for this service. Branch already has an email ex: " [branch01@xyz.com](mailto:branch01@xyz.com) "
 My idea is to create a DL as ["pp-branch01@xyz.com](mailto:"pp-branch01@xyz.com)" and set its users ( managment) to view these emails and request as apposed to using the " [branch01@xyz.com](mailto:branch01@xyz.com)" .
 I know a drawback is that DL wont have a stored location compared to a mailbox but I feel like creating 2 emails is unnecessary. 
 Using a DL will also avoid the branch email reading the PayPal email not intended for them or even delete it.
 Im all ears to know how your org handles this, thank you!

 Others ask me to take tests that attempt to identify how I think, solve problems, get along with others, ECT. These I can sympathize with a little more, but they always ask you to take them after talking to the hiring person, not anyone that knows a ton about the job
 Am I way off base here? I think they're just looking to weed out applicants...

 I started making custom classifiers / queues but then after asking specific questions about what traffic was going to flow over this, the contacts response was "it's a standalone PA system. The only traffic going through it is PA traffic / multicast traffic, so just a single vlan"
 He wants 4 different queues setup, each with a different DSCP ranking but...
 if the ONLY traffic is multicast traffic running on one vlan...what's the point?

 Just came out of a long ass meeting with this guy (Bob), and every department manager under the sun. Bob was trying to throw me under the bus because his software installed on half of our endpoints couldn’t report back to the management console for 6 months now. He's saying how my environment is trash, that I botched the deployment, that I didn't go to him to test, blah blah blah...
 Rewind 6 months.. Bob reached out to me asking for help because suddenly nothing is reporting back to the console. I was running a project at the time, so I didn't have a lot of time to do a deep dive but a quick look was showing that the proxy is blocking the software from contacting the console. I sent an email saying just that and that he would need to log a ticket to the security team to get the sorted.
 I guess he didn't do that, now everything is urgent and it's my fault. Everyone is starting to side with Bob then having a go at me. So, I pull one of my contacts from security into the meeting, asked him to whitelist the URLs used by the software, and voila! Suddenly it's working. WOULD YOU LOOK AT THAT BOB?
 In my livid state, I dug up that email I sent and forwarded to everyone in that meeting, then left meeting abruptly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
 Our main corporate location has been suffering from a rather annoying issue for almost a year now. We have a 600 user office in the midwestern United States. The trouble is, Google is classifying our public IP addresses as being in Brazil. This is rather annoying for our users, as search results return the Brazilian versions of websites as well as the search results appearing in Portuguese.
 We can easily switch the search results to English, but the Brazilian websites still appear as first results.
 Normally you can enable the browser to detect your location (probably also through public IP), however we have an Edge group policy disabling this. We are unable to enable this due to security concerns (even though every website can view our public IP anyways).
 Ultimately it looks like the issue is an incorrect location mapping in Google’s geo-cache. I have submitted multiple automated requests to get this updated (using this: https://support.google.com/websearch/workflow/9308722?hl=en). However after around 50 submissions over various months, nothing has changed.
 We are a full Microsoft shop with no Google products (so no line of sight to any direct Google support). Looking up our public IP’s using ARIN show the correct address information. Other browser and IP based location services also correctly identify our location.
 Has anyone ever ran into this issue or have any ideas on how to remediate it? I know it’s nothing on our computers because Google correctly identifies the IP location of our remote users and all of our other offices. Unfortunately it is this one office with the issue.

 Vendor says there is a problem on Office A's Network.
 This is my argument - Office A (My main site) can pass 127Mbps of TCP Traffic to Office B (My remote site) over an IPsec VPN Tunnel. This should mean, at a minimum, I should be able to see at least 127Mbps of traffic from Office A, to the Vendors Azure Instance. I know our Router can pass at least 127Mbps, however we're only able to pass 56Mbps to the vendor.
 The vendor says their Azure server is not setup with an active/active VPN, just failover. They're stating there is no load balancers in place.
 What am I missing? This has to be some sort of routing issue between the ISP to Azure, or, some sort of bottleneck in the vendors Azure environment right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had my Masters in Electrical and computer engineering. I was earlier interested in automation and robotics so I started working as a controls engineer. It is interesting working with CNCs, PLCs, and robots but I’m tired of working longer hours. With a job like this I either see longer hours, remote location or lots of travel. I’m unable to give my family much time as I’d like to. 
 I’m looking for something where I can also work from home. I had courses from networking in engineering and I’m fascinated so I started to learn a bit more for CCNA. I’m just worried I’ll have to start from scratch and will have to take a pay cut. I currently make between 90-100k. Is this a smart move or no? Can I make more pay once I get skilled in networking?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 I work for a small but quickly growing business that has a number of employees working partly or fully remote. The company has been upgrading all of the networking equipment for our relatively small on-premise server/domain, but I'm still running into issues with RDP accessed through the client VPN provided through a Cisco Meraki MX64 SD-WAN.
 The RDP/VPN connection seems to struggle mostly with video but it also sometimes drops for no real apparent reason. It's out of my normal scope of work but I've been attempting to troubleshoot down to at least a general root cause.
 After doing quite a few pings/traceroutes/MTRs from the MX64 I've noticed that the ping to the local ISP node (50.46.181.20) seems to spike semi-regularly from very respectable numbers (1-10ms) to strangely much higher numbers (20-40ms). The connection can cope when I'm just doing office work but seems to push latency tests (performed via testmy.net/latency) on my local machine into the 200-300ms on certain video calls.
 I'm not hoping to pin down a specific cause with these tests, but would highly appreciate any insight into where I should look further.

 EDIT: My Environment is large enough that we may different kinds of climates, requirements and goals in many different situations with varying budgets. We have a few vendors but, not all needs are for servers. I'm not so sure that they care either.
 That said, its nice to know whats out there and what people are using and what their projects are.
 For example i didn't know Eaton had Lithium based Batteries in their UPS line. I happen to know if not over charged Lithium Ion can last notably longer than lead acid, and Lithium Iron Phosphate Far longer than Lithium Ion. So the idea of Lithium based Units is quite interesting!

 We use an ITIL based system so some tickets are termination requests where they were properly termed, just not archived yet. Those I'm not too worried about (actually looks to be about 100 of them)
 But how do you handle 100s of incidents/break-fixes? Sometimes getting answers from people are pulling teeth with tweezers. Sometimes its a legit issue but there's just no good fix at the moment. I'd love to get this under control. I've added rules and tweaked the logic on the ticket system to require people to reply to tickets if I've replied to them (7 days from my reply, ticket automatically closed).

 [My cell phone rings - personal phone, but I also use it for business]Some Guy: Hi! I work for [company]. I got your info from LinkedIn [NOTE: my LinkedIn profile DOES NOT include my phone number at all] and I was wondering if you have a few minutes to talk about what tools you're currently using to secure your cloud infrastructure?
 Me: [context-switching and baffled] I can't talk now.
 SG: When can I give you a call later?
 Me: You can't.
 [CLICK, END]
 Listen, I'm not sure who needs to hear this, but if you are in sales and your job description includes a part where basically you need to cold call companies and try to social engineer their tech people, then I need to inform you that you, your job, the company you work for, or some combination of all three, truly suck and you should feel ashamed of yourself.
 If, however, you are actually a Black Hat, then.... you're doing a bang-up job! Keep going with your bad self!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm new to RDMA technology, and I'm confused by several rdma libraries. I cannot figure out the relationship among them. The libraries and kernel headers I'm confused with are as follows: 
 1.rdma-core/libibverbs
 2.rdma-core/librdmacm
 3.linux-5.4.2/include/rdma
 4.linux-5.4.2/iniclude/uapi/rdma
 My question is: 
 1.As far as I know. libibverbs provides the userspace applications with verbs api(i.e. functions with prefix ibv_), but it does not offer any connection-related functions, so applications need to exchange connection information using sockets(I see this operation in the libibverbs example rc_pingpong.c). librdmacm provides the user with easier connection management mechanism(e.g. rdma_get_cm_event). However, it seems that librdmacm does more work than connection management, since it also defines several apis(e.g. rdma_create_qp in rdma_cma.h) which looks similar to the ibv_function in libibverbs. So I do not know whether librdmacm is a superset of libibverbs? If not, what's the relationship between them?
 2.In the example rc_pingpong.c of libibverbs, I cound see it includes the header file verbs.h, and it seems that linux-5.4.2/include/rdma and linux-5.4.2/iniclude/uapi do not play any role in the program(no heaer files in these two directories are included). So what are the header files in these two directories aimed at? 
 I have refer to several materials but have not made it clear. Any explanation or related resources are well-appreciated. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently have been working on moving our org to a security-key based MFA solution considering the various attacks against more traditional push, SMS, call, or TOTP MFA solutions. 
 As part of this process, I started looking at the various avenues of attack that could bypass FIDO/FIDO2/U2F MFA style authentication. Previously I would use something like EvilGoPhish to phish employees/customers and steal their session cookies to bypass MFA but this does not work with U2F.
 Then I came across an article that mentioned using WebUSB to defeat YubiKey and of course where one attack exists, other attacks also exist.
 The important quote from this entire article.
  
"Vervier and Orrù found that they could code a website to connect to the Yubikey Neo with that WebUSB feature, instead of with the usual Chrome API for U2F that it's designed to use. In doing so, they could circumvent the checks that the browser performs before querying the Yubikey—the checks that confirm that websites are the ones they claimed to be." 
  
Thankfully STIG has descriptions of how to disable both WebUSB and its sister technology WebBluetooth.
  
Disable WebUSB
 Disable WebBluetooth
 
 TL;DR WebUSB can be used for novel attacks to attack local security keys and bypass MFA.

 My question is, what is the best practice for management vlans? Do we tag the new management vlan or keep it untagged? If we use tagged management vlan, should the native vlan be a blackhole vlan?

 I'm setting up a lab in GNS3 to pilot enabling DHCP snooping and Dynamic ARP inspection. I got this setup and working properly with a Nexus 7k image, but it doesn't support port channels and I want to setup my lab to mirror the real environment as closely as possible. I got the Nexus 9k 10.1.1 image from Cisco and have it all configured, but I can't enable arp inspection because it says the ether-region needs to be set in TCAM. I've tried to do this but it throws an error. Trying to set any of the existing TCAM region entries to 0, saving the config, and rebooting results in no changes being made. There is a screenshot here - https://imgur.com/92E7B3a with more detail.
 Does anyone have any advice on how I can make this work?

 We have now run into the problem of to many SSIDs
 These SSIDs span over 2000 access points across the entire plant and we need them on every ap for roaming (I can't profile down any further)
 From what I can see from other large deployments companies are moving towards a few SSIDs with a large capacity -- eg instead of 4 SSIDs with 2000 clients we would have 1 ssid and call it "Manufacturing" and create a /20 network for it.. this also allows us to add more vlans to the blank group if we ever need to expand its size.
 We might also create 2 SSIDs 1 with FT and another with just adaptive.
 What are you large wireless folks doing.. looking for advice and reasons why to go one way over another

We're talking 100+ or so of them. This was done about a week or so ago. Monday, while i was checking my MM a bunch of the (down) APs popped up again on the MM. Minor nuisance really, as my APs in prod are working fine, but it's just weird that some came back. A lot of them had partial names to them too: e.g. an AP labelled "A-102" showed up as "A-10", etc. 
 ​
 Any idea what happened here? The only thing i can think of that changed was our Solarwinds alerting was enabled after the deployment was done. It wouldn't make sense since that's on the SW side.

It appears from message trace in Exchange Online, that one person on a distribution list (used for enquiries are sent from their website) are having them sent straight to their Junk Folder. 
 I've asked them to mark the domain as safe, but they are still being delivered to junk. I've looked in PowerShell using the get-inbox rule to see if they've set anything, but it gets no results. 
 It seems odd behavior that an internal email address would marked as junk for one user. Has anyone else seen this problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So in my IT shop the security teams seems to run everything, and make all the decisions. The security team is not super tech savvy to put it nicely , but will just log into server and make changes not knowing what they are doing. An example it logging into Windows servers and stop/disabling the firewall service. They seem to be making all the decisions for the enterprise environment, software to use or not use. I am not talking like we will not allow some software because we see it as a security issue which is actually their job, but like running the evaluation of major software like Okta (which i like by the way) then buying it and forcing it on the rest of IT without their testing or input. They seem to spec out the hardware not just say ever device needs to be from proper sources and have TPM etc. But they have no idea about hardware or how it works. They are opposed to anything open source which kills me. I am very cautious about open source, but sometimes it just is needed. To many example for non open source vendors with huge security issues that they don't fix or disclose. Security by obscurity. They love to hold everyone's feet to the fire about change control but do impacting things without using the change board, nor notifying the impacted persons. Like someday getting an e-mail from the application that your admin privileges are gone without any notice. CIO seems to be ok with this. Like cyber is doing all the work on the move the cloud? 
 This all seems really backwards for me, but I need perspective. My idea of security it to set policy, weigh in on enforcement changes, set infrastructure goals for the actual sysadmins to move toward a more secure posture, deal with incidents, and stuff like that. Not hands on doing IT's job.

 I'm a past Nutanix customer and had nothing but good experiences with those appliances, but for whatever reason our higher ups dislike the name and brand because our past appliances were "slow" and "clunky" and didn't seem interested in hearing about how we were past due for refreshes as we were one of the early adopters of nutanix back in 2013 and were still running essentially 8 year old gear. its a bit of a long and complicated story, but we had to gut all our nutanix stuff after covid budget cuts happened, So i just have a feeling Nutanix wont be considered.
 the other 2 contenders we are looking at are Dell vxrail and HPE dHCI. I'd like to ask which of these 2 would you go with if you had a choice? or if there is something different all together you'd recommend? the VM cluster is very overprovisioned for what we have, so this will be a bit of a rightsizing attempt based on current workloads. consuming about 40-50GHz of CPU at rest, 500GB of Memory, and about 15TB of storage. a full flash solution would be my preference to keep our IOPS performance equivalent to Pure. Cloud is not an option at this point

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So for some context, I've been at my first IT job for a little over a year now. I work at an auto group that has 3 dealerships of which the only IT is my boss and me. 
 Despite my many efforts to use a ticketing system, they say "we have tried in the past but it just doesn't work" we have a Microsoft to-do list because according to them it's essentially the same thing. This leads me to often get either in trouble or my wrist slapped because I'm "working on things that are not important" and it leads me to get calls from my boss regularly, or when I have all my obvious projects done for the day I get the "What are you doing right now" which sometimes is "Nothing" which is never a good answer but its an honest one. 
 I've just been so frustrated, especially since the pay is $4 an hour less than my best friend who does very similar work 10 minutes away. it Doesn't help that my boss seems bipolar half the time, I am 21, and he is around 24 so we will often talk about girls, cars, etc. but a lot of the time I feel treated like a dog, it's like he treats me like I don't know anything and will talk down to me and just generally treats me bad. 
 I'm really conflicted, I overall like it here, and I've only been here a year but it's becoming so much more often that I think "I could just leave right here and now"

 I noticed yesterday my teams seemed to update to a newer version, more rounded windows, larger drop shadows, slightly different fonts/aliasing. It was buggy AF. Multiple attempts to start, hanging on the Teams Splash screen, Unable to log in. Delays in starting video calls.
 Today... that update is gone and I'm back on the older version. I don't know if this is Microsoft backpedaling or just something weird with my machine.
 Anyone else noticing the changes and/or experience user calls? 
 More info: the latest version for windows - October 12th presents a significant update to the Electron Framework. from 10.x to 16.x Likely the cause of the issues/bugs, because you know, Microsoft likes to QA/Beta Test on customers now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know the first answer everyone's going to want to post is JAMF, but my current Mac presence is not that strong, and there are plans to stop issuing Macs altogether, but for the time being I'm trying to come up with a solution that doesn't involve a new service, with yet another set of licensing.
 I've been configuring an Intune environment, which is working fine for Windows/Autopilot, however I do see there are MacOS options. I'm wondering how useful this is, to those of you that have worked with Mac in Intune.
 I'm assuming autopilot is out of the question, and our help desk will still need to do some manual stuff, but I'm hoping some could shed light on a few questions:
  
Is there an OS deployment function for MacOS, similar to Autopilot?
 These are just going for be for a full AzureAD environment, not hybrid. Does that make a difference?
 The laptop will need a local user account created, right?
 Can we register all of the Macs to a single Apple ID, in the event of a user forgetting their password or something?
 Is a local admin account possible, if so, doable through Intune?
 Lastly, any recommendations for remote control software. I've used ManageEngine, TeamViewer, Dameware in the past. Not sure Dameware is even a thing anymore, TeamViewer might be possible but looking for what you guys have found to be most efficient.

 Apparently, OME is using ECB encryption which seems to be not much of a step above message obfuscation instead of being a secure encryption method.
 So, if you have a requirement to send secure email, OME is not meeting that requirement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 We have a product which sends out system notifications to our customers Sysadmins etc. We use SendGrid to send these emails (which works like a charm BTW).
 However - several of our customers are asking if we can send the e-mail from their domain (so that the FROM field would be ["someone@customerdomain.com](mailto:"@customerdomain.com)".
 I've looked into the whole authenticated domain setup in SendGrid (which we went through ourselves) - and this seems like the correct approach. However: 
 1) What would the most "correct" approach be? Should we create a subuser and then authenticate domains for each of our customers on this subuser? Sending our customers the SPF record etc. generated by SendGrid.
 2) We're not all that interested in doing this manually every time a customer asks. Does anyone have experience with using the SendGrid API for authenticating domains? 
 I'm a developer (not a Sysadmin), so I'm a bit worried to mess something up. Basically we just want to use our SendGrid account to send emails from different domains (approved by the owners of the domains).
 Could anyone walk me through the correct way to do this?
 I've tried reaching out to SendGrid support, but they just keep sending me to the same "How authenticated domains work"-article, which doesn't explain the scenario I'm interested in. 
 Any help would be greatly appreciated! :)

 ​
 I currently have a MAN with ~20 sites interconnected with dark fibers, in a sort of a ring topology, plus a dozen WAN sites. All these sites are l2 connected (even WAN sites with metro-ethernet) so I have sometimes typical l2 issues (broadcast storm, stp misconfig...). To overcome these problems, I am thinking of doing a redesign of this network with consultants but before meeting them, I would like your views on what are the current technologies used for this type of network and what are the pro/cons.
 My needs: 
 - L3VPN but also sometimes L2VPN for legacy applications, 
 - the simpler solution the best from an exploitation point of view, 
 - ideally throughtput between sites should be 40+/50+ Gbps
 - and stable (but does it really need to be specified :-)
 I did some research, there seems to be 3 main technologies for this type of network: evpn/vxlan, traditional mpls, and sr mpls which seems to be the "new simplified" mpls (perhaps i overlooked some). From a budget standpoint, the evpn/vxlan solution seems cheaper because available on switchs, and mpls seems to be available only on router hardware which could be expensive if i need to go for 50+ Gbps interfaces.
 ​
 Thank you for your help.

I don't see anything different in the communication either before or after the nic disabling except that the browser loads. I see no certificate failures and that is not something showing as the issue on the browser. It also happens if the page is internal to our company or external. We have had the desktop tech update the nic drivers but I don't think that's the cause. We have had the proxy server bypassed for the testing machine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 We are used to have dedicated management interfaces on network devices. As more and more functions/features are hosted on x86 devices, it's natural to implement the same management mechanism.
 To avoid mixing management and data planes, multiple routing tables have to be implemented. There are, from my understanding, three ways to do it :
 - namespace
 - table + ip rule from/to
 - vrf (added to linux kernel thanks to cumulus)
 Excluding namespaces which are too heavy for this need, what could differenciate the two last propositions?
 I can feel that vrf have a stronger implementation/traffic isolation but it seems that the result are approximately the same ?
 Thank you,
 Romain

I was wondering if there was any benefit to blacklisting these clients after repeated failed auth for a period of time? Am I right to think this would free up some AP capacity as they will ignore that client for the duration of the blacklisting meaning less resources are wasted on talking to a client that is failing auth. Any other suggestions on how to improve welcome. Thanks.

According to a new study from Wanclouds, 81% of IT leaders say their C-suite has directed them to reduce or take on no additional cloud spending as costs skyrocket and market headwinds worsen. After multiple years of unimpeded cloud growth, the findings suggest enterprises’ soaring cloud spending may tempered as talks of a looming downturn heat up.
 As organizations move forward with digital transformations they set out on at the beginning of the pandemic, multicloud usage is becoming increasingly unwieldy, and costs are difficult to manage across hybrid environments.
 Furthermore, a wrench has been thrown into IT teams’ plans over the last two quarters in the form of the market tumult. Rising inflation and interest rates, along with fears of a potential recession have put increasing financial and operational strain on organizations. As a result, many companies are reevaluating their digital ambitions as cloud spending is brought under the microscope.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Since about a year, Microsoft refuses to offer us support through Teams-calls and instead only wants to reach out by phone. For us, having calls over the phone instead of Teams is quite inconvenient as we prefer having multiple team-members on the support call at the same time. Of course, it's possible to have multi-person phone calls, but it's obviously not as optimized as Teams. Also, scheduling Teams-meetings through the calendar in Outlook (which we used to do) instead of 'verbally' by mail brings the added benefit of not having to miss calls because the support-engineer mixed up his timezones. Finally, sharing single screens through Teams is better than being forced to share your entire desktop through Quick Assist.
 Does anybody know why they do this? When we ask, they avoid the question. For us, it's both inconvenient, irritating and strange, because it looks like they deem Teams to be an unsafe way of communicating. Before this, I generally had great experiences with MS Support, but this is just really annoying.

 Here's the deal:
  
There is an office with two floors, each with a different type of user. Type "A" use the Windows keyboard layout "X" and type "B" use the Windows keyboard layout "Y".
 Each floor has its own VLAN and DHCP server.
 Computers may be arbitrarily moved between floors, so the same computer may be used by both user types.
 All computers and users are domain joined. All computers are in the same OU. "A" type users are in the "A" OU and "B" type users are in the "B" OU.
 Each computer has a hypervisor running a Windows VM. Every time a computer is shut down, the VM goes back to its original state.
 All computers shut down automatically at 21:00 and turn on automatically at 07:00.
  
How would you ensure user type "A" has the Windows keyboard layout "X" preconfigured on the Windows logon screen?
 How would you ensure user type "B" has the Windows keyboard layout "Y" preconfigured on the Windows logon screen?
 Thanks in advance!
 Edit: I have tried with a powershell computer startup script that changes the relevant registry values depending on the Windows VM gateway, but it doesn't work (it works if executed manually after user login, so it's not a scripting issue), maybe because when the script is executed Windows doesn't have a gateway yet?
 Here's the part of the script I used to get the gateway:
  
$ip = Get-NetIPConfiguration | Foreach IPv4DefaultGateway | Select-Object NextHop
 $gateway = $ip.NextHop.ToString()
  
Going passwordless is my last resort!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow geeks! I need some suggestions for my application.
 I have a server and I need to read around 200files per second, they are image TIFF sequences and the size per file can be from 100kps to 3megas. I need to read this files in Real Time and it works but after a while (30seconds) the read times slow down a bit as the drives/bandwidth has reached the limit and needs more time to deliver the files.
 I currently have a server grade NVME PCI gen 3 raid controller (don't have the server in hand) and it handles 8nvmes. I have it set for Raid 0 but maybe on my specific case could Raid 1 be more beneficial?
 The reason I'm wondering this that if the controller asks for a single 100kps file to 8 diferent drives and needs to wait for all 8 to provide the data before it can proceed to the next file and it needs to do this 200 times a second maybe on Raid 1 2 drives have the same file and could potentially provide a more consistent random access performance?
 This is very specific and um trying to get some more knowledge. Thanks in advance

However, for security reasons, we would like to force users to type their password in at least once week, instead of a PIN or using their face/biometrics. This will mean that they will have to type their long passwords and the system would block them from using any other sign-in method in particular instance.
 We plan to roll out Windows Hello for Business via Intune.
 Is this possible to do and if so, how can we go about doing it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm doing some clever (stupid?) routing between leaf (bgp, L3 fabric) and openstack (software routing in overlays).
 I got to the point, when I have two (or more) routes, and only one is valid (i.e. can deliver traffic to the consumer). The difference between them is that in one case there is active nexthop IP, and in other there is none. Nexthop is connected through a bridge, therefore it's impossible to use link state to check if nexthop is available or not. The single way is to check if it can be resolved via arp.
 There are other ways to solve my problem (healthchecks, hooks into openstack code, etc), but I wanted to investigate feasibility of the nexthop 'resolving' (in this context, resolving of IP into MAC, i.e. arp). Are there the name of this technique? Is someone using it?
 Basically, I have a route:
  x.x.x.0/24 via y.y.y.y dev foobar 
 And this route should only be taken in account when y.y.y.y can be seen as a neighbor in ip neighbors, and ignored, if not.
 I use bird for bgp, so it's either bird feature (check nexthop resolvability), or linux routing feature.
 Is this a thing, or should I try other ways?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We planning to migrate the CA within the same domain. The Old Certificate Authority (Legacy Cryptographic Provider) has permission to issue the Old smartcard logon v3 certificate template. The new Certificate Authority (Crypto Next Generation) has permission to issue the New smartcard logon v4 certificate template (both templates are configured the same except for the cryptography tab). The most interesting customization in the templates below:
 In both templates, the following parameters are configured in the Issuance Requirements tab:
 This number of authorized signatures 1
 application policy
 Certificate Request Agent
 Valid existing certificate
 We have a lot of users using smart cards to logon, to reduce the load on our help desk (enrollment agent) we want to use the Supersedence template. So that our users can reissue certificates on their own / autoenrollment. To do this, use the criterion in the Issuance Requirements tab: Valid existing certificate
 In the New smart card logon certificate template, the Supersedens template tab contains the Old smartcard logon certificate template, certificate templates are replaced correctly with us.
 The question is:
 The user receives a request to renew/autoenroll the certificate in tray OS balloon, the user sees the required template that has been replaced ( New smartcard logon ), but when continuing to work with the certificate issuance wizard, the user is requested to sign the enrollment agent.
 Tell me, is this because the certificate issued by the Old smartcard logon template does not fall under the Valid existing certificate flag for the New smartcard logon template certificate?
 Do I understand correctly that this will not work without an enrollment agent in such a configuration?
 We cannot refuse to use the enrollment agent, we must control new users and issue a certificate for them.
 Thank you for help.

Basically my role is to take care of a POC environment AKA lab manager for their pre & post sales engineers to deploy their respective solutions for demo to their potential customers. The problem is, I have no idea what's going on with my lab and my reporting manager then was too busy to entertain my inquiry, most of the time they outright ignore me.
 After a year for some reason I've been assigned to a new reporting manager who happens to be the principal SA for the lab. Met them privately to discuss my dissatisfaction and what I really want for years to come. In the end they promised to get me involved more in whatever pertaining to the lab and to be frank, I don't buy it. I was right though because so far it's same shit just different person.
 This really demotivates me as I believe what they're doing devalues me as an experienced engineer for 7 years not to mention the jobscope that they promised during the hiring is far from the reality. I'm more than just that guy who holds CMDB for the lab and gives "consultation" to presales engineers every single day. Been thinking of jumping ship so far not landing any gig.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm currently looking for console server data solution for mainly Cisco devices. What do you think about out of band (SIM CARD or wifi based(?) ) console servers - theoretically sounds very good - how about the practice ?
 Also there're some other requirements we would like to have:
  
minimum of 16 interfaces
 possibility to use RJ45 to RJ45 UTP cables for simplicity and longer range cross-rack connectivity (than simple Cisco console cables).
 Continuing from 2 - the device should be able to rollover programmatically that cable (also - how this function is called - (software selectable pins) ?). Because manually changing pins from straight through to rollover in UTP cable from standard is not very sustainable solution. In Ethernet world similar thing is called auto-mdix - it's interesting how this thing is called in serial world :)
  
Any suggestions ? Thanks

We're rolling out the client via SCCM, and have tried installing it both before and after adding the devices to an OU with LAPS set up. Any ideas where to go next would be appreciated. Everything that I have read suggests that LAPS will not create, enable or rename accounts. We can recover the LAPS password OK, so it looks as all Schema and OU setup has been done correctly.

 I know I have low Karma, but have been on reddit for quite some time, hope this is the best sub to ask help with (and actually lets me start replying to other subs without complaining my Karma is too low)
 Anyway, I have asked google countless times and my first go-to is reddit for issue like this, but all the fixes I have found for others do not seem to work.
 Trying to log a ticket with MS too, but seems we don't have support credits, considering what we spend per month, but will try and use another service to jump off.
 Issue:
 We had an Exchange 2010 server in full Hybrid running fine, all mailboxes were migrated to 365 a few years ago and we could use the on prem 2010 box's to relay to 365 for printers etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been running the numbers and for a small organization with a file, app, and SQL server doing a fairly nominal amount of processing, Azure seems to make financial sense when looking at on-prem alternatives (physical host running ESXi or HyperV). Are any of you migrating existing environments totally to Azure at this point? Especially given the uncertainty of VMware licensing with Broadcom, I’m thinking this might be the last big wave of on-prem for SMBs. Am I missing anything on the horizon?

Could one of you be hired into such a situation, where nobody has any Domain Admin access and there was no remaining account left (all admins used smart cards with unknown PINs). Would you figure it out before it's too late, as a total outsider? You could get datacenter access of course, just no ideas on accounts/credentials. Let's say, a mishmash of 300 servers (mostly VMs, Server 2012 R2 or Server 2019), 1500 workstations (mostly W10), up to 300 users on VDI, and 2000 employees total.
 Are there reasonably-priced outside services that specialize in recovering in such situations to save a company that accidentally their SysAdmins?

 A bit of background - I'm helping out a small tax office that has two sites. Site one has 5 desktops and the other has 2. 
 Site one has a Synology Nas Active Directory environment. 
 Site two the users have an account on each pc. 
 They want to be able to share files between the two sites and use roaming profiles.
 I don't like the Synology and would like them on a windows environment. 
 I'm use to supporting a large corporate IT environment. So the solutions that I'm use to just don't make business sense to a Small office. 
 If one of you can prescribe us a setup that would be awesome!
 A traditional option and a cloud hybrid option.
 Thank you for reading :D

 I'm testing a firewall in my lab, decided to do a little BGP just for kicks and ended up here. In the past few hours, I've learned all sorts of strange things in regards to rules that some ISPs have when peering with customers. Are ISPs generally that anal when peering with customers?

A week later (Today) a head hunting company contacts me on indeed about a job "i would be PERFECT for".. Guess which job it was for.. Yep, the one that rejected me. I told them they rejected me and they asked if I want to apply anyways I told em "Screw it, Go for it lets see what happens". Thats when I get another email about a job in my town from a different head hunter company, and then another, and another, and another. So far 7 different head hunters from different companies have contacted me regarding this position. I've said yes to every single one. Why? Because f--k them, thats why.

 We have no help desk. I was promoted years ago and they never replaced me. So for about 200+ it's primarily me juggling stupid help desk and admin/engineering work with my boss helping occasionally. 
 All of this guys tickets are closed and resolved. Like it's my fault he doesn't ask to reopen tickets or put new ones in if something reoccurs. My bad I'm not babysitting you non stop while I have 1000 other things to do.

 Is that practice still considered best? I've been seeing automated emails from vendors with the FROM address being the root domain. Are they just being careless? Obviously best practices are likely applied, (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)... but is that considered enough to the point where companies are using their root domain to send automated emails out that way.

I'm also now trying to include in my question are there any specific certifications that are within reach of my high school kids? Assuming they're in my program and are taking intro college-level classes in programming and info security, what's appropriate and worth their time?
 Hi folks,
 ​
 I'm a high school teacher, running a great computer science department and we recently added a (for college credit) course in information security.
 ​
 I'm attempting to find out some information for the sake of my students interested in working in this field. I was hoping to get some guidance on credentials, certifications, college education, that sort of thing.
 I'm not the type of teacher who wants to just tell all of his students to go get a bachelor's degree if it's not necessarily going to suit them well for their career. Are there other ideas out there that are more appropriate? Do you need a B.S. to even get in the door? What subject area(s)?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For any ISPs offering 10G DIA or XGSPON links to residential and SMB customers, what sort of gateway are they using and how is the performance?
 I don't have any 10G equipped gateways to play with so I'm messing around with some servers and 10G NICs. Here's the lab, all are Dell R620s with dual Xeon E5-2670, 32GB of memory, and Intel X520-DA2 NICs connected with DACs:
 Server A 172.16.0.1/30 | Server B "WAN" 172.16.0.2/30 "LAN" 192.168.1.1/24 | Server C 192.168.1.100/24 (DHCP) 
 Servers A and C are running Debian 11 on fresh installs. Server B is running pfsense with a basic NAT configuration. Server A is running iperf3 as a server. Server C is iperf3 client.
 If I boot up iperf3 and do a regular test from Server C to Server A:
 upload [ ID] Interval Transfer Bitrate [ 5] 0.00-60.04 sec 38.0 GBytes 5.44 Gbits/sec receiver download [ ID] Interval Transfer Bitrate Retr [ 5] 0.00-60.04 sec 26.3 GBytes 3.76 Gbits/sec 89 sender bidir [ ID][Role] Interval Transfer Bitrate Retr [ 5][RX-S] 0.00-60.03 sec 37.0 GBytes 5.29 Gbits/sec receiver [ 8][TX-S] 0.00-60.03 sec 25.7 GBytes 3.68 Gbits/sec 72 sender 
 Of course, better results with 8 threads:
 upload (-P8) [ ID] Interval Transfer Bitrate [SUM] 0.00-60.02 sec 54.6 GBytes 7.82 Gbits/sec receiver download (-P8) [ ID] Interval Transfer Bitrate Retr [SUM] 0.00-60.01 sec 49.6 GBytes 7.10 Gbits/sec 685 sender bidir (-P8) [ ID][Role] Interval Transfer Bitrate Retr [SUM][RX-S] 0.00-60.01 sec 40.3 GBytes 5.77 Gbits/sec receiver [SUM][TX-S] 0.00-60.01 sec 26.8 GBytes 3.84 Gbits/sec 224 sender 
 I notice the bidirectional performance is slightly better, but basically the same with more threads. Is this a NIC limitation or possibly tuning? I know the x520 is fairly old by now. 
 Has anyone done any testing like this? Has anyone tested NAT throughput on more affordable hardware like Mikrotik or Ubiquiti?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My understanding is that if let's say there are multiple devices in a LAN and device A wants to make request to a webserver on the internet -
 Source IP of A will be replaced with the IP of the router from the packet which is going out to the WAN.
 So if the source was 10.10.0.1:9876 and IP of router was 125.12.31.7 then router will translate source to 125.12.31.7:5000 (5000 being a random available port) 
 Now the router will note down :
 Source : 125.12.31.7:5000 = 10.10.0.1:9876 
 So that when the packet comes back from the server it will look up in the table and send it to the Computer A. 
 If this computer A had made multiple requests, they all would have been allotted different portnumbers from the available pool. Same if Computer B had made a request. 
 So basically it's the unique port number which is being used here to determine where to send the packed when it enters router from outside world. 
 What if the number of requests from within the LAN to WAN exceeded the number of available port numbers? What would happen? I mean there are only 64,512 (65,535 -1,023) available ports at max.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all! Been lurking in this thread for a LONG time, but figured this would be as good a time as any to finally post. My IT Director asked me to look into finding a Smart Card solution so that employees can log into PCs. We're a small Hospital and many of the nurse stations have give or take 5 communal PCs that they need to log into the domain to use. I've tried convincing my boss to remove that step and just use a limited Kiosk account as all patient information is locked behind a second login and a remote connection (Parallells), but that's been like trying to pull teeth. So, I'm trying to make this as easy as possible for our staff to log into their accounts and get things done. Any ideas for a badge scan or fingerprint solution to speed up the process? I really don't have a lot of experience in this very specific subject and Googling this subject has been a mess. Figured you guys would have at least some recommendations.

 Do a little recon and digging - his .ost file (Outlook is locally caching) is just under 50GB. He "has" to be delegate on 10+ people's accounts too. "Shockingly", he is not accepting this as the reason for his problem.
 He definitely is not liking my suggestions.
 Edit: please note, per the below MS article
  
Very large (25 GB or larger): An .ost file of this size increases the frequency of short pauses, especially while you are downloading new email messages.
  
and
  
In Outlook 2010 and later versions, the maximum size for a .pst file is 50 GB.

 Edit 2: so, I think I've talked him down off the cliff. I removed his profile and created a new one. I am watching the .ost grow though so we'll see where this story ends...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to solve an issue in our environment where, as developers continue to work remotely, we have homebrew devices that need to be on our network to recieve code pushes from our Jenkins servers. These devices are all custom and not capable of having additional software installed on them.
 I have attempted to connect these devices to GlobalProtect enabled RaspberryPi devices, sharing the GP IP, which gives them access into our network, but this solution fails because the devices are not visible behind the Pi, and are not reachable to have code pushed to them.
 We have deployed at least 1 home firewall for a key developer but this is not a sustainable approach. Is anyone familiar with a product that would fit this need, or deployed something similar?
 Also, ideally the solution would have some sort of security (at least MAC auth) so that any random device can not connect to our network. 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all. I'm wondering what sort of laptops your companies are giving out to users these days? 
 We formerly had desktops, but we moved to a new office that the CEO insisted on setting up as a flexible workspace, so everyone needed laptops, and then covid showed up and we went remote.
 We currently have MS Surfaces (the CEO's choice) through a 3rd party vendor. Most people seem to really like them, but I'm getting complaints from a few people that then need more powerful ones. Particularly a few people complain about the amount of ram they come with. I've got a user insisting they need at least 64 GB of ram to work properly, more than is available in a surface. I'm deeply skeptical of this particular user's claim, but that's a different issue. I sent him to his department head to argue with him about getting the budget. If he actually gets budget to buy one, I'll need to source it whether I think he really needs it or not. 
 Anyway, what sort of laptops do you all like to send out? How much ram do they typically have?

 I recently took a new job and was hired to help get a new software up and running. As I'm going through the requirements, I can't find the options they want. I do my best, then email the software support asking if I'm missing anything. The support emails back that what I need isn't even an option available. 
 So who authorized this? If the software can't do the main thing you want it to do, who agreed to purchase it?!? Was the request even asked to the selling company before purchasing? What am I going to do with this software now? Thousands of dollars wasted.
 I'll never know because I joined on after it was already purchased. But holy shit does it get me heated. End rant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've inherited a network that is using public IPs inside it's LAN. I've been tasked to begin cleaning these up and make them proper private IPs. Another fun fact about this network is that the original designer tagged Vlan 1 on all uplink ports. Of course Vlan 1 is still also the default & native vlan throughout the network. Our main data subnet, cameras and door controls are all on Vlan 1 across the entire company.
 The project requirement is to implement department vlans at our main site and have a few other vlans at other remote sites as needed. Of course they want to move the cameras off the data subnet and also use vlans for IOT, printers, and a few other departments at some sites.
 Our WAN is connected using AT&T Metro ASE Layer 2. We have an Aruba 3810 L3 Switch as the gateway at each site. IP Routing is enabled on each of these L3 Switches.
 We have 12 remote sites, STP is in use at each site, but we only connect using static routes. No ospf, rip, bgp, etc.
 My initial thought is to first install all of the new subnets/vlans throughout the network. Then slowly begin moving the Vlan 1 devices over to the new subnets. We have a server team that will handle most of the systems that will need their IP changed so my main task is to ensure connectivity.
 How would you handle moving users off of Vlan 1 onto the new subnets? For all you L2 WAN folks, is there a better way to approach this?
 I appreciate your thoughts & inputs.

 ​
  
Microsoft has received reports that after installing KB5018427, some types of SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) connections might have handshake failures. Note for developers: Affected connections are likely to be sending multiple frames within a single input buffer, specifically one or more complete records with a partial record that is less than 5 bytes all sent in a single buffer. When this issue is encountered, your app will receive SEC_E_ILLEGAL_MESSAGE when the connection fails.

 I am about to do some testing with the monthly update and wondering what I should look for that might necessitate the OoB patch to also be deployed along with the cumulative.

 In my last position, the remotes used RDP over VPN (with 2FA) which was plenty snappy with fiber at the office, and I also used ConnectWise for support. I found ConnectWise a less responsive in general than RDP but not unbearable, but I preferred RDP for fulltime work.
 RDS/Citrix would be overkill at my present position as a one-man show in a small office with just a couple of FT remotes and a few people who sometimes work remotely.
 ConnectWise Control Access pricing is very attractive. I would prefer to use it for support anyway, so I wanted to hear what others were doing in smaller offices with limited remote users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posting for a friend that doesn't have a reddit account: 
 I've recently started working as a sysadmin + network guy for a small business, around 50 employees and up to a 100 devices if we take into account mobile phones.
 The company has a dumpster tier firewall that's basically not doing anything and a vm running pfsense for openvpn. There are around 8 ubiquiti 'enterprise' switches in the network and a few APs. 
 I would like to replace the firewall with something a bit more manageable and feature rich. Naturally i'm thinking of Fortinet etc for the price but I've also seen the Dream Machine Pro from Ubiquiti which has the features we need at a really low price (I assume it's not a great unit...) and would allow me to manage the rest of our switches centrally. You can't even monitor traffic on the switches without a gateway anyway which sucks so I'm tempted to go down this route instead.
 If the dream machine pro supported openvpn for remote workers I would grab it but it doesn't so I'm still hesitant. 
 Do you guys think it's better to grab an actual enterprise level switch from Fortinet or maybe a pfsense plus box from netgate instead of a dream machine pro?

They are a hybrid of Macs and a few pcs that they purchaced before hiring me. I am thinking about moving from Google Workspace to Microsoft 365 because that is what I am used to. In addition too, they are willing and able to move to a windows environment. This company has been very reassuring that I can move them in any direction and they will pay for it.

 ​
 I'm managing the (2) computers of a small library few hours a week, and i want to block adults sites on them.
 I've tried to block them using hosts file with this list : https://dsi.ut-capitole.fr/blacklists/
 But it froze explorer.exe, maybe due to the length of the file (4.5M lines) and the poor capacity of the computers.
 ​
 Do you have a smaller banlist which be usable on low config ?
 Should i try something else like changing the DNS ? (is openDNS good ?)
 Or do you have good parental control software to suggest ?
 ​

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm writing this, because unfortunately - on an almost daily basis - I see people that have this habit.
 Do not run the PowerShell as an Administrator, unless you absolutely need to. So, when do you need to? When you are changing local system setting or deleting/modifying files that only Administrators have access to. When in doubt, run PowerShell normally and just try to run the command you wanna run.
 You never need to run a PowerShell as an Administrator, when you are remotely configuring resources, through PSSessions, CIM/WMI, or when using any other cmdlet that has a -Credentialparameter, such as the AD module.
 The gist of it is this: If you do not know why you need admin permissions, you should not use admin permissions.

 The errors I got were:
  
Irql not less or equal
 
Kmode exception not handled
 
Page fault in nonpaged area
 
Unexpected kernel mode trap
 
 This was all very late into the night so I decided to shut it off from bios when I got the chance and now today I decided to remove some plugged in USB devices and I also removed my second monitor (which uses a DVI adapter)
 Today it hasn't crash once so far, I have plugged back in the usb devices but not the second monitor.
 I kinda suspect on the SSD because windows is installed in it, it's also a drive I bought back in 2019, and it's a 256gb drive with over 30TB of writes according to crystal disk info, but it also says that it's in good health. The drive also has tons of hours since I usually let the PC on 24/7.
 Now, should I replace this drive nonetheless? Could the problem really be the DVI adapter? (I ran into problems with it before but it had been working for months until yesterday)
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I feel as though I'm going insane. For the life of me, I cannot track down the cause of why this is happening. 
 A website I host https://semdeck.com (for reasons I cannot figure out) is showing two forward slashes at the end of it so it appears as semdeck.com//
 I've set it up the same as every other website I've ever built. Here is part of the .htaccess file:
  
# Always use https for secure connections 
 # Replace 'www.example.com' with your domain name 
 # (as it appears on your SSL certificate) 
 RewriteEngine On 
 RewriteCond %{SERVER_PORT} 80 
 RewriteRule ^(.\)$ https://semdeck.com//$1 [R=301,L]* 
 <IfModule mod\_rewrite.c> 
 RewriteBase / 
 # rule 1: remove multiple leading slashes (directly after the TLD) 
 RewriteCond %{THE_REQUEST} \s/{2,} 
 RewriteRule (.\) $1 [R=301,L]* 
 # rule 2: remove multiple slashes in the requested path 
 RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} ^(.\)/{2,}(.*)$* 
 RewriteRule (.\) %1/%2 [R=301,L]* 
 </IfModule>
  
And the functions.php file contains the following:
  
/\** 
 \ Define Constants* 
 \/* 
 define( 'ASTRA_THEME_VERSION', '3.9.2' ); 
 define( 'ASTRA_THEME_SETTINGS', 'astra-settings' ); 
 define( 'ASTRA_THEME_DIR', trailingslashit( get_template_directory() ) ); 
 define( 'ASTRA_THEME_URI', trailingslashit( esc_url( get_template_directory_uri() ) ) );
  
I thought that both of those are signaling that there should only be one "/" at the end of the domain but I guess not. Either way, I am completely out of guesses as to why this is happening. Perhaps a plugin conflict? I've gone into Yoast SEO and even modded the canonical URL for the homepage to no avail.
 Anyone have any idea what's going on here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some context:
 I work for a computer refurbishing/resale shop. We operate mostly through online sales and handle hundreds of laptops and desktops a month. I typically am responsible for refurbishing and repairing units for resale.
 We set up a WDS server just running on a local network (not connected publicly) using an old netgear router for handling DHCP to quickly load units. The WDS is configured properly and works , as long as the images are good.
 The issue I run into is sometimes is dism doesnt pull a good image from a unit, and breaks the WDS (Shows no available images if a bad image is present) . It took me a solid 3 weeks to figure out what was going on, but eventually came to the conclusion that if I delete the bad image from the server, then the WDS continues working properly.
 ​
 My question is this,
 Why are some images bad? and how can I fix it? 85% of images I make work flawlessly, while some simply refuse to make a working image. 
 Steps taken so far:
 Most recently we got some Dell 7460 AIO's in, around 40 of them. I created an image as I always do, and loaded it on to the server. The issue occurred so I deleted the image and used a different unit to make an image, still no dice. I then tried using dism healthcheck and repair commands, dism sees nothing wrong with the image. I tried using compression on the image to see if that would make a difference. The image is Windows 11 Pro, and the Dell Optiplex 7460 is fully updated. I also tried making a Windows 10 image and that did not work either.
 I'm not sure if there is a correlation but here are some of the other models I cant get a working image for:
 Lenovo T540P
 Dell Latitude 5491
 Lenovo T460
 ​
 I cant understand why the WDS will simply reject some models. I'm hoping someone has some insight.
 ​

There’s still remnants of the old layer 2 192.168.x.x around and the ultimate goal is to get rid of it completely but that is going to be a rather complex and lengthy process due to VPN tunnels and a bunch of other things. 
 What I need to figure out is how to get that 192.168.x.x network on to the new side of the network. I need to migrate VMs that are on the 192 side over to new hardware that lives on the other side of the firewall. It is both physically and logically separated other than the firewall that has an interface for each side. New fiber and cables have been ran for the new side of the network. The image below shows an example of how the network is designed and what I’m trying to accomplish. I thought about changing vlan tags and tagging everything on the new side and trying an untagged vlan for the 192 but I’m needing some help and ideas.

 We have all the common ones, and some really specific ones...
  
all@
 announcements@
 office-LOCATION@
  
But the real issue is sometimes they don't want to include "contractors". We know who these folks are from Okta. But I cant make them use distribution lists, if they just want to send it to all.
 Does anyone have a good example of naming conventions for fixing the "employee type" problem? We have all the data/okta to solve this. Its mostly just doing a better job this time.
 "management" has proposed:
  
all@ for full/contingent workers
 all-extended@ for everyone human(no service accounts)
 contractors@ for contractors
  
This scenario would be CFO sending out internal financials, wants to not send to contractors.
 I personally hate all-extended. It reeks of all-except-some, and global-not-sales vibes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Most admins have Office 365 test tenants to simulate a small corporate environment to test scripts, install apps, and explore the new configurations without affecting the production environment. But, few admins run the scripts (which are downloaded from the internet) directly in the production domain. It's not good to run any scripts directly to the production. 
 Admins can maintain the Office 365 test lab without an additional cost through Microsoft 365 Developer Program. You can use the test tenant for years if you use it regularly. Otherwise, it would expire in 90 days. You can't retrieve data from the deleted tenant. So, If you have a budget that you can spend for your test tenant, then you better go with a business subscription.
 How do you maintain Office 365 test setups? You can share your techniques with fellow admins.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greeting,
 I find my self looking for a program that a small team could use to log what work they have done so that if in the future one of the other members needs to look up information on a old project he can find it easely. 
 A little more explanation as English is my third language and the explanaion on top is a bit vague.
 Recently a senior colleague unfortanatly passed away unexpectedly and now the 3 of us that are left find our self in a bit of a pickle as we are getting questions on how to manage past systems he has set up withouth having any documentation on the process he used to set up said systems. Most of the time things are written down in Word and stored locally somewhere or backed up to the archive under vague names. 
 So this got me thinking that there should be a program out there that is on prem (since we cannot use cloud features due to security reasons) that one can get, where whe can use it as a work log that anyone of use can access and see how and what other people have done on past projects.
 P.S. I hope this is the correct subreddit for this question, if not let me know and I will delete the post (also if you know the correct subredit, I would appreciate that info).

I have found some information but they are talking about gMSA and "run as" / "give full control" to an application as domain admin.
 The situation is, that in our organisation we develop applications ourselves and to execute them administrative permissions are neccessary to update / install and/or run the application. 
 I don't want to give myself a lot of work in maintaining and continously sending an IT employee their way to authorize an installation.
 Anyone has some tips to get around this issue? Without losing security? Because I preferrably want to withdraw all admin permissions and only give them out when needed. So I am curious if sysadmins here have a creative solution for this?
 Again thanks for the help in advance!

However i have searched far and wide over the Ethernet and i could not come up with a possible implementation that already exist more because the terms "ip scheduling" provide result in different topics.
 For my current project i have a couple of devices connected over a closed network to my main server. This server is publicly reachable on another Ethernet interface. The devices are normally accessed because packages are forwarded from the server by nginx/iptables config through the server. The idea was that there is a front-end hosted on the main server where people can reserve a time slot to gain access to one of these internal devices. Then only in said time slot would the packages be forwarded and else dropped.
 ​
 It feels like i am not the first one to implement such a feature. However i have searched far and wide over the Ethernet and i could not come up with a possible implementation that already exist more because the terms "ip scheduling" and like wise search queries provide result in different topics like human resources or dhcp static ip reservation (github was full of people making there own hotel reservations systems which would often popup).
 ​
 Therefore the question if someone may now if such a system already exist? If not i could write my own with nginx or iptables something as the gatekeeper is my plan.

The main reason why I was so careless is because the sender name was very similar to one of our customers. The virus itself was bundled inside of an img file. We use sophos central email gateway with all bells and whistles enabled - including the sandbox. The mail made it through all of that, windows 11 defender (also with all bells and whistles enabled) didn't catch it either. 
 With the help of someone smarter than me we managed to gain access to the ftp server that the virus uses to upload extracted login information. Afterwards we sent an abuse notice to the hoster who immediately deleted all contents and locked the customer out. 
 We use the default sophos list for blocked attachment file types (sophos specifically recommends using it instead of making a list on your own!). I'm trying to change that to a whitelist so for example only PDF files are allowed everything else goes into quarantine. But apparently sophos central doesn't even have that option or am I blind?

 ​
 First, if this is not supposed to be posted here, you all have my sincere apologies.
 ​
 I am a web developer (don't throw stones yet ^^ ) and I come to you looking for advice.
 ​
 As a pet project, I am building an application to streamline data collection in non technical teams.
 It is a server based application (PHP) with a web interface so I would see it either as a cloud product or on an in house server.
 I am trying to do things the right way, and one of my next steps is to think about user authentication.
 For the basics, i made a username or email | password authentication, users stored in the database, password encrypted using bcrypt. The administrator create user accounts and generate an account specific url for account activation. Transmission of the url is the responsibility of the admin.
 To go further, I plan on implementing some SSO methods.
 My guesses are:
  
google
 openId
 microsoft AD (this one will be fun to debug, as I never understood windows server XD)
  
Finally come the question:
 If you had to sysadmin such a solution, what SSO solution would you expect to find by default ?
 (And to go further, what kind of functionnality would you expect to find out of the box ? )
 ​
 Thank you in advance :)

 I'm trying to integrate this Policy into our noncloud Active Directory Domain. But it`s a local policy and I can't find the corresponding admx file.

 How would one go about to propagate that Local Computer Policy to all clients?

 I have an e-BGP connection to an upstream internet provider and I take a full route table (approx 900k routes) If I take a second connection to a different upstream to a second provider also with a full route table will I exceed the max allowed routes? Or, will it be OK because BGP will only take the best routes between the two and discard the others in the route table?

 We are in a hybrid environment. During user deprovisioning, after the users are disabled and the associated license groups are removed, we currently keep them synchronized via AAD Connect.
 ​
 I know that when the users are de-provisioned, they are moved to an OU in AD that is not synchronized by AAD-Connect.

 I can't find a "best practice" or similar in the Microsoft documentation, is there a recommendation from Microsoft?

 How do you guys handle this?

 So far I've tried:

 Can anyone help me out? I'm relatively new to MacOS. The macOS version we currently have installed is Monterey.

 We're currently trying to secure the network even more and we'd like to setup 802.1x auth for printers to put allowed printers in the correct vlan, and unknown devices in a quarantine vlan.
 Computers are authenticated using their AD computer account, and printer don't have that.
 Certificates are also not a good solution since printers are not able to request renewal themselves... 
 I've seen posts saying "you just have to create a AD user account with the macaddress and same for the password" but no one seems to care about the fact that this is a huge security issue.
 The only thing I found was to create a "Connection Request Policy" for each MAC and put them above every other regular policies.
 Conditions are :
 - Calling station ID = mac address
 - NAS Port Type = Ethernet
 Settings :
 - Authentication : Accept users without validating credentials
 It does not have to be 100% secure but at least prevent users from connecting untrusted devices like some 3rd party contractor who comes for the day and needs "internet"... but I'm still looking for ideas or a better way to do it.
 Thanks in advance :)

 https://imgur.com/a/nrG2JcM for a basic network diagram
 Had an issue where *out of nowhere, after years of this setup* the Cisco ASA got flooded with 169.254 addresses and killed the network. 
 I know what you're thinking - why the f*** do you have such cheap dumb ass unmanaged networking equipment for a 30 user environment? Because we're cheap and stupid and have no money. Believe me I've tried. I don't want to go any further into my thoughts in case of this post being found to be honest, but it is not a favourable position I am in.
 Anyways,
 I figured there was maybe a network loop happening, with this being just as the office was closing I got everyone to leave and I powered everything off. I determined that 1 small switch with 2 computers hanging off it was tripping the network when powered back on. The other switches/computers were repowered and are OK.
 The 2 computers appear fine, like I have pretty detailed software inventories using our endpoint protection agent, and indeed plugging the laptops in elsewhere, no issue.
 This is where I am out of diagnosis, knowledge, experience and wit. So I guess I can blame the switch being worth about $10, but why would it be spamming 169.254 addresses?
 I have now plugged the "faulty" switch in elsewhere and it no longer trips the network. Has this been a red herring all along?
 Moral of story is - we need better equipment so I can actually see which ports/devices these addresses were coming from. But I am still in the sad situation where I cannot properly explain the outage, so hoping for ideas.
 ***Disclaimer. I bring this post with great humility, regret and pleading forgiveness. Yes, it is barely an amateur setup for a business turning over millions of $. Just trying to get by.

 In the system log I find one entry:
 The Group Policy settings for the user were processed successfully. New settings from 0 Group Policy objects were detected and applied.
 Both log sources indicate that all user GPOs vanished from the client. gpresult shows for the user details under "Organizational Unit" that I am in a OU where inheritance is blocked and no GPO applies. However, this is not the case. My user is in the right OU!
 When I manually run a gpupdate /force everything goes back to normal. Nothing else was changed, indicating that it should have worked the whole time.

 Since SPMT didnt give me any sort of errors, and telling me that no files was skipped, i belived that everything was in perfect order.
 However, i can see that it is far from in perfect order. Lots of files and folders is missing. And it seems random which files is missing and which dont. There is no difference in rights on the folders, where files is missing, and there are no obvious reason to why the files are missing.
 Running an incremental task with SPMT makes no difference, it wont acknowledge that there are files it doesn't sync up.
 Its quite a large filedrive. My original plan was to sync everything with OneDrive to a temp location on a fileserver, and then have something like FreeFileSync to compare files and sync the missing files. But is not a viable way since OneDrive taking a really long time to get something in sync, and i dont really believe that it can handle all that data, because its also freezing up on me.
 ​
 TLDR;
 So im looking for some tool, not SPMT, since experience, that can compare my files on the fileserver to a Sharepoint site and sync the missing files. Preferably free.
 Ideas?

I asked the tech about removing the 3-way splitter in place, wondering if it had degraded and possibly causing issues. The tech tested the signals with an expensive looking tool and determined the signals coming in were good. At one point, he did indicate we could remove the splitter without issue. But, them he tested it again before proceeding and noticed an issue. 
 The way the tech explained it was if we remove the splitter, we would gain 5dB somewhere, but then lose 5dB somewhere else which would push past a certain threshold that would cause sync issues. Im not even sure it was dB, but I have to assume. He wasnt great at talking smart and I wasnt great at knowing what he was talkinh about. Im not an expert in coax cable signaling and understanding readings. I have worked at an ISP in tech support and understand the basics and sync issues, but I never got trained or learned much about this. Any help is appreciated.

 I've been researching MTP fibre cables and can get my head around, just about, Type A, B and C (and AF), but I've seen a "universal polarity" https://www.fs.com/uk/products/143164.html?attribute=6679&id=299323 but very little documentation about on what that actually means.
 Can anyone explain? And why I'd use it over the other types?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently working in tech support (just over 3 years now) and really am wanting to move over to sysadmin. I've sent out a handful of applications and am having no luck so far. I've realized that there is a huge gap in knowledge and experience between tech support and sysadmin.
 I am "level 2" at my company and deal with our business products so I work with admins vs home users which has given me some understanding of what a sysadmin is, but I'm still missing a lot of what's required for a sysadmin position.
 Is a helpdesk job going to be my best option for getting into a sysadmin role? I'm hesitant to pursue helpdesk since I'll more than likely lose a noticeable amount of pay, but there is no more growth for me in tech support and I would be able to make more in the long run as a sysadmin.
 Has anyone here gone directly from tech support to sysadmin? If so, any advice on making that switch?

Upon inspecting the source code there are TONS of links that point to gambling websites and other stuff involving crypto. Our insureds use the website to log into their portal which doesn’t contain any PHI but it does have PII such as addresses, phone numbers, etc..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grumpy old IT guy, coming in hot again.
 We had a filesystem migration to a new server this weekend. Figured there would be a few hiccups, given how thorough (/s) our testing team was. Sure enough got a P1 ticket that they are unable to process files from a system this morning. Turns out they were using sftp to push files up to the old server for one of the data flows.
 So, easy enough fix. Once I was sucked into the P1 group call this morning, I told them exactly what needed to be done. Put in a request to get ssh access to the new server, and here is the new path to the directory. Easy peasy, just like I sent out last week.
 Cut to 6 hours later. The call now has over 20 people on it, including management. They are dissecting all the data flow diagrams, and just ruled out the application server as the issue about an hour ago. Two managers asked me to rejoin the call, and before they could even 'recap' everything they've done so far, I pasted a screenshot of what I told them needed to be done from 6 hours ago, and got dead silence.
 Seems one of the offshore managers (yes, this is ALL coming from our offshore "support partner"), stepped in at the end of the call this morning to manage the issue. They are supposedly working on the access requests now and will let me know. In other news, now management wants me to write up an RCA as to the problem, and corrective instructions. Sure, no one read my emails over the last couple weeks warning of this change, they ignored my instructions for the fix this morning, and the still don't seem to fathom what they did wrong. That about covers it.

We're running out of IP addresses on the /23 network, would it be okay to increase the network to a /22 without causing broadcast issues or, is a /22 too large of a broadcast domain?
 Normally I would just create a additional subnet/ VLAN however, creating a second network/ VLAN wouldn't be ideal as ideally we need a single SSID.
 We use DHCP exclusively on this subnet with no static addresses - would it be a good idea to increase the network to a /22 but only increase our DHCP scope to 6-700 IP addresses to limit the size of the broadcast domain as much as possible?

 Anyone ever covered anything like that?
 ADDENDUM: I don't mean Adobe Acrobat. Just Reader. Acrobat certainly has its vulnerabilities too but a hugely smaller foothold in the fleet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 We are currently using EAP-TLS with Computer Certificates to authenticate corporate assets before granting them access to our network using EAP-TLS. We have recently been discussing whether to extend this to the chaining of both Machine and User authentication.
 We are currently discussing whether to perform the User Authentication using PEAP (EAP-MSCHAPV2) or EAP-TLS with a User Certificate. 
 For Machine Auth I would always use Certificates rather than PEAP, but is it just as easy to manage user certificates? And are there any security concerns? From a Machine Auth perspective, the user has no business touching the certificate unless they have local administrator rights on the PC (And they don't).
 In this case, the Certificate will be issued to the User itself, so what kind of access do they get to the certificate? Will they be able to possibly export it with a few tweaks even though we issue it as 'non-exportable' from a PKI perspective? The fact that they have just the slightest access to the certificate itself, makes me wonder if it would be best to stick with PEAP for User Auth and keep Certificate Based Auth for the Machine only.

I spotted a PowerEdge R740 Server at a company that recently did a partial hardware refresh. They have 5x 3.84 TB SAS SSD's in this server, which seems a bit unusual to me. I would have expected to see an even number of drives for SSD's, not an odd number. I thought RAID5 shouldn't be used with SSD's? A single boot drive doesn't seem like a good idea (plus 3.84 TB is a lot for a boot drive). I suppose one could be a hot spare since they don't have on-site IT Staff, nor do they have an MSP. Their IT Department is at their main office hundreds of miles away and they fly in as-needed. 
 Anyway, just curious as to why there would be a 5x 3.84TB SAS SSD Setup?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently have two routers running in my small business network setup. One is setup for the main network and is my Fortinet 80f. It currently has a 1gb circuit from ISP 1. The other is a Pfsense sg-3100 which is set up for our Kraft's team only and it has its own 1gb circuit from a different ISP. My problem is the ISP on my main router is pretty crappy and has outages all the time. I would like to utilize the 1GB on my 2nd router for failover. I figured there must be a way to configure the lan port on the pfsense router to be able to utilize the circuit on the main router. Any ideas on how i should proceed with this configuration? vlans, bridge mode,??? help please!

 Anyone had the same case to do and can share some commands? I am guessing it should be possible with power shell to read the meeting information and then use that information to update each task scheduler task. Thanks.

 We used to run all HP printers. Recently we have picked up some Epson color printers. I had no issues with the m401n printers, they run and use off brand ink.
 I need to buy some new ones, I see the HP 4001n is a replacement. The reviews aren't great, and I have been unhappy with the newer HP LaserJet printers requiring HP ink (404dn).
 This specific use case is printing AP bills and reports, all black and white, medium volume. A few hundred pages once or twice a week. ethernet connection is preferred in our environment. 500-700 range preferred price. As far as size goes the 401n fits perfectly on his desk.
 Does anybody have anything they like?

The reason for the alert was that mdstat was showing "UUU_", which normally means that the 4th slot has a failed disk. 
 After reading a bit, I thought that perhaps he should remove that 4th disk from the array, but he didn't want to do that, so instead he'll just disable the alert. The full conversation is [here](https://community.netdata.cloud/t/critical-mdstat-disks-alert-on-4-bay-synology-nas-with-3-drives-shr1/3387). What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all
 I am a developer and manage a few IIS servers serving mostly ASP.net classic and core web applications. I am bombarded by probing hits to various attacks. Like someone incessantly hitting /xmlrpc.php or /wordpress/wp-includes/wlwmanifest.xml, neither which are a feature supported on the server. They are mostly Asia or RIPE hits. I cannot do geo blocking as I do allow access to many of these countries. 
 I use a product called RDPguard that intercepts attempts to RDP, FTP and other services and bans IPs via Windows firewall for n hours when they fail out. I am wondering, is there a means via a module or small addin to do something like this but only for IIS 403/404 requests that fail? One IP has hit that wordpress URL 80 times before failing out, only to try again an hour later. Obviously I added their IP to a deny list but they will just come back on another stolen IP or proxy later.
 I realize I can use IIS to deny patterns, but the 404 handler is doing that already. I want to block that IP if possible on the 10'th time for 4 hours. 
 Ideally I would set up 10 or so common strings I am seeing in logs. Some are even just basic SQL injection phrases, like a select * in the query string. I don't want to implement a full IPS just yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Afternoon all
 ​
 I have under my care a Windows Server 2019 Standard, V1809, OS Build 17763.3532
 It's main purpose is Backup
 It Runs Veeam Backup and Replication.
 ​
 It is Directly connected to a cluster of ISCSI Switches. a 10GB connection into either one and setup with Nic Teaming for the two 10GB Nic's
 We have also tried this with just the singular 10gb with no Teaming and experience the same issues.
 ​
 Now onto my issue
 ​
 Randomly we have a major ISCSI failure which results in a total network loss which results in failed backups.
 I have attempted to get support from Veeam But as far as they are concerned its an infrastructure issue and not their problem to deal with.
 ​
 ​
 Now onto my issue
 It all starts with an error IScsiPrt Error 20 in eventviewer
 then we get in mixed order Event ID - 129,9,39,27,63,43,10
 ​
 In Eventviewer i see those Event ID's in no particular order and often 9 repeats a few times in a row.
 what this represents physically is a total network loss 
 ​
 After a few Hrs systems seem to stabilise the errors stop and the network re-establishes
 and backup pick up where they left off.
 ​
 We do eventually have successful backups
 ​
 This issue occurs at what appears to be random to me (i cannot find a solid item to pinpoint the start of this issue from)
 I am at the end of my tether, have attempted every fix i could find, including registry edits and as men=tioned above adding a secondary 10Gb Nic.
 ​
 But the issue keeps re-occuring
 Please help

 I ask you if you know of any other operators that allow you to view the statistics of your network, such as WeatherMap or traffic graphs on the backbones.
 An example is OVH, which displays its backbones and relative "load" percentages at this address: http://weathermap.ovh.net/#europe
 Another example is the GARR network which allows you to view more data than the previous one, also including graphs of aggregate traffic on the links.
 Also Nerim (France ISP) if you click on "Accès Invité" its share own graphs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hoping to get a second set of eyes to make sure I'm not overlooking something obvious on this one (likely). I did reach out to my vendor, but they weren't really much help.
 ​
 A user of mine appears to have had their mailbox compromised. It was then used to communicate with their accountant to request etransfers be made. The email itself was very poorly crafted and shouldn't have fooled a 6 year old, and it was even filtered to spam. My concern though is making sure I'm reading the logs correctly and making sure any security holes I stupidly left open get closed, so it doesn't happen again.
 ​
 The mailbox had a randomized password with enforced MFA and no app passwords in use. These measures were in place before the supposed compromise happened.
 There are no secondary SPF records that would be allowing sending from another source (website, mail service, etc).
 If I do a message trace on the sender's mailbox, the message shows up. The sending mail server is a godaddy address.
 There are no send connectors, custom user mailbox rules, etc in place and I've confirmed there's no delegate/send as access for the account.
 ​
 ​
 TLDR: I'm positive I'm overlooking something basic here. Would I just be sleepily misreading the logs and it's a junk spoofing attempt which is why it would have initially been filtered in spam? I haven't dug into 365 logs much in the past but had assumed unauthenticated mail wouldn't be showing in a user's message trace.

 Hope y'all are having a nice Monday so far.
 ​
 Question.... I am currently implementing a new Client Authentication template that will be configured to use Autoenrollment in order to get deployed to client machines.
 ​
 This new template in question, I have also decided to configure Template Supersedence. I have added 2-3 templates that I want this certificate to supersede. 
 ​
 After logging into a test machine that has older certificates deployed in it's store, I do receive the new template and it also removes the older certificate as is expected with the supersedence.
 ​
 Now, here comes the million dollar question. If my machine was provisoned using Autopilot and this process installs a certificate using SCEP, would this certificate also get removed from the machine if the template is configured as a superseded template?
 ​
 Reason I am asking is that this scep certificate doesn't seem to be removed when I log on to the machine. I'm wondering why. The only difference with other certificates was the method by which it was deployed (Configuration Profile instead of Autoenrollment through group policy).

 Apparently, it's been happening since last week, but not many users complained. When we investigated this issue today, we found several other users have the same issue, and they all had KB5018410 installed, and those that didn't have this issue didn't have the update installed. We uninstalled this update from the affected machines, and everything started working again!
 We do use RDS Farm with UDP, so not sure if it's related.

 X20 LTE-A (DW5821e) with eSIM
  X20 LTE-A (DW5821e) without eSIM
  
They are both the same price.
 Why would I choose the "without eSIM" variant? Does the "with eSIM" variant no support regular SIMs as well?
 To add confusion, I have found DW5821e chips only that mention "eSIM only". I can't imagine this is true but still... very confusing

 When I tried to sign up, the sales person suggested Enterprise Essentials - giving us 2TB of user storage. (I cannot find the web page for the product!) It offers the most space without email. 
 Apparently to buy Business Plus we have to set it up on a different domain. No problem, however, my question is if we can set it up and get it to work well without the email component.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Morning all, so here's the backstory- my company has old Cisco Ironport appliances that need to go, and we've been trying to migrate to a CASB, but since our default route and proxy no longer sit in the same path, we've been having problem after problem with misdirected non-proxy-aware traffic.
 I can narrow down our list of suspects by running Wireshark captures while correlating local ports to process IDs with TCPview, which is fine on my own machines, but not really feasible with impacted clients who we're pulling out of their production work to run test cases for us.
 The sticking point is preserving the list of PIDs and correlating to source ports. I can get the PIDs from tasklist, but that's just a single point in time. I can get the PID to local port linkage from netstat, but that's also just a single point in time. I could enable process auditing, but our Security event logs already roll over too fast to scope troubleshooting across a full day because of file auditing (Splunk is tightly controlled with a formal change process, so that's out for stretching the log storage in any kind of timely fashion).
 I'm aware I may be able to catch this in ETL format, but my ETW game is weak and limited to: pktmon capture > pktmon etl2pcap > read in Wireshark; I have no experience at all with collecting app data in ETL.
 At the end of the day, I'm just looking for a single tool I can run that can get me these four fields for diagnostic purposes:
  
<PID>
 <Process Name>
 <Source IP>:<Source Port>
 <Destination IP>:<Destination Port>

 There are a plethora of snippet manager apps for developers, with syntax highlighting, etc, available for macOS, eg: - SnipperApp - Snip - massCode - SnippetsLab - Quiver
 ...and so on. 
 Some of those are free, some are one time payment, and some are subscription. Some are simple, some more elaborate, but all of the ones above are really designed for Developers - the syntax highlighting supports only programming and scripting languages, really. 
 I was wondering if any of you guys who are network engineers and also mac users have an app that would serve well as a snippet manager with syntax highlighting for Cisco, Juniper and other network config formats? 
 I'm currently using MacVim with vim-wiki plugin, and it works reasonably well, but I would like something with a bit more structure, where I can more easily search through and look for notes / config snippets. 
 Thanks!

I'm not confortable with this setup, but perhaps it's just me;
 I wonder if there's a downside in using many disks vs growing an existing one and modifying the partition table. Apparently the volume overhead is minimal, so it shouldn't be an issue. What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm working with a vendor and they have their SMTP system where they input the normal settings for SMTP. It keeps failing in their system (Says check credentials, even though I'm 100% sure it's not the credentials), I thought it was their system because when I use the website below, it works fine and sends me an email using the SMTP information I provide. Also, we use SMTP for scan to email on printers for this same account which also works fine. So I know for a fact SMTP is working correctly for this account that we are testing.
 https://dnschecker.org/smtp-test-tool.php
 Settings used:
 SMTP SERVER: smtp.office365.com
 Port: 587
 Email From: Scanner@G**********.com
 Email to: (Myself)
 Use Secured Connection enabled
 Use Authentication enabled
 username: Scanner@G**********.com
 Password: (Scanner's Password)
 Outcome: Success
 ​
 However, I just checked a different tool, using the exact same settings and it's failing on the below website that requires the exact same information.
 https://www.gmass.co/smtp-test
 Settings used:
 SMTP SERVER: smtp.office365.com
 Port: 587
 Email From: Scanner@G**********.com
 Email to: (Myself)
 Use Secured Connection enabled
 Use Authentication enabled
 username: Scanner@G**********.com
 Password: (Scanner's Password)
 Outcome: Failed
 ​
 Anyone know why SMTP would work for somethings but not others? I would expect as long as it's using the same Port. server, security and username information it would work if it's working for other SMTP tools.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 we are a medium sized dev company. As of today, any application is developed in our own tenant. Devs are able to register new apps, grant (most) delegated permissions and start hacking away (loosely speaking).
 There are a couple of issues I see with that approach:
  
Apps grant permissions to production data.
 Bugs or misuse can lead to data loss.
 App credential stealing can lead to data loss and leaks.
 Registering enterprise apps can lead to data leaks.
  
For that reason, I'd wish that development is out-sourced to a non-production tenant. Or better: Each project gets their own tenant. We have a couple of dozen parallel projects and this could prevent teams getting in each others way - even if that would be only by accident.
 There are currently two ways I can imagine how this works:
  
For every new project, a standalone tenant must be registered. If licenses are needed, they must buy-in. Ideally, this is managed completely separate from IT e.g., by the project manager or a designated tenant-owner. They manage the tenant registration, credit-card info and payments, licensing. We have a devops-department, maybe also they could take over dev-tenant management company-wide.
 For every new project, a M365 developer subscription sandbox is registered. The upside to this is that it is batteries-included with licensing and sample data in most used areas like EXO and SP. The downside is that this tenant is linked to a person in the company, who may leave the company at any point in time. (Now that I think of it, we could use service accounts to have this not linked to real people.)
  
I imagine that this tenant should not be managed by IT at all. The project members are responsible for security, compliance and data privacy.
 How are you guys managing this kind of stuff? Are there other solutions I have not thought of yet?

Neither he nor I have tons of experience. Today a server rebooted and when it came up again the SQL server was down due to expired evaluation as I found out, when reviewing the logs.
 Turns out the reason for not having a license was that it was too expensive for us, but as long as the DB was >10GB it shouldn't be a problem I was told, but tuns out that only applies if you use the express version. We only need this particular server for 1.5 months more before it will be taken down anyway.
 Is it possible to migrate the db from the standard edition to the express? I also read an article saying that I can turn back the clock on the server, but I fear that may lead to complications with other systems, though that would be an easy solution given we only need it for 6 more weeks.
 I am frankly a little out of my depth here. I'm good at figuring stuff out by furiously googling and never giving up and I have worked as a junior sysadmin for two years and have been dabbling with homelabs etc for many years. I'm decent with networking and Linux, but I have not worked much at all with SQL, especially not MS SQL. 
 Could I buy a license for just two months perhaps? Please help, this is a production system.
 What should I do?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am currently setting up several services that we will be having users log into using LDAP over TLS so I am setting up HTTPS through Caddy reverse proxy. In an ideal setting I would set up a Linux server with Nginx Proxy Manager to do this but I have been denied from setting up a Linux VM on our network. Our contracted network engineer has refused to have a Linux VM or an Internal CA on our network to make this project work according to any documentation I find online.
 He has provided me with a third-party wildcard certificate for our domain and has set up a Windows Server 2016 for me to use for the project. Is there any way for me to specify the wildcard certificate in the CaddyFile to be used for each reverse proxy without needing to declare a DNS challenge as according to the documentation. I currently have it creating local certificates with Caddy's internal CA but it will still give a warning to end users and most will not know how to allow exceptions.
 As I am new to using Caddy and failed miserably trying to set up a reverse proxy through IIS any suggestions would be appreciated.

 I'm also managing some cPanel websites and I've noticed that they have high or unlimited number of mail accounts for the fraction of the cost of a pure email provider. How does that work?
 What are my options of adding email taking into consideration existing VPS?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Excuse the rant.
 Depending on my sleep or coffee levels, it's either amusing or infuriating the sort of things I see because DMARC. I'll ignore everything else for now, this is just DMARC.
 Common, daily occurrences include:
  
Sending DMARC reports for received DMARC reports
 Receiving a "mailbox full" error for dmarc@some-idiot.com
 Receiving a "message rejected by spam filter" because the message attachment contains blacklisted IPs. Huh I wonder why those are there
 Receiving a "mailbox does not exist" error, because reasons.
  
And my new, personal favorite: 
 "INEPT-COMPANY Request received - Report Domain: inept-company.com Submitter: dmarc-sender.com Report-ID: inept-company.com.1665896400.1665982800"
 That's right, their DMARC address is listed as support@ which is their Zendesk address. So any DMARC reports sent are going to end up automatically creating a ticket!
 I don't know what's worse, their ineptitude at understanding how to setup a mailbox to take a set of messages every day, or how their support team feels dealing with the daily ticket influx of a completely automated and unactionable message.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 ​
 Been bashing my head against a wall on this one. I am renewing an SSL cert for my RDGateway server. Done it plenty of times, never an issue. This one, however, when I apply the cert users can't login and event log shows 0xC000035B. Replace the new cert with the original one (not due to expire for a few more days), and all good again.
 I figured it might be the cert (somehow), so I tried adding our wildcard cert to the RD Gateway instead. Sure enough, same error. Put the original rds.domain .com cert back in, it works.
 I found various articles suggesting setting EnforceChannelBinding to 0 (via regedit) on the RDG server, which out of curiosity I've done - no difference. I also set LMCompatibilityLevel on my PC to 3, no good. No other posts I've found so far that have to do with that error code have much else info i'm afraid.
 Has anyone else ever seen a new SSL cert cause users to fail logging in? Or does anyone have any ideas where to start looking? Nothing has changed server-side other than the cert, and besides - you'd think if it had, the old cert would have broken... Thanks in advance!
 ​
 EDIT: The only thing different from the last time is that there's a new firewall in that does HTTPS inspection (or something along those lines, it's managed by a 3rd-party). I'm reaching out to them, in case it's the difference in SSL certs causing this, but does that sound likely to anyone else? (i'm fairly new to HTTPS inspection sorry)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I've got a branch office that was previously sending Internet traffic to the ISP and local office subnet over an IPsec tunnel w/ bgp. The plan now is to send local subnet traffic AND all internet traffic over this tunnel (in this case, the other end is Prisma cloud, but scenario should be the same if it was the HQ) This is my first time sending all traffic over the tunnel, so the routing intricacies escape me a bit. 
 https://imgur.com/a/jYJZweo A scribble diagram to help visualize and give better detail.
 ​
 So initially, changing the next hop for 0.0.0.0/0 to Tunnel.1 would bring the office completely down. My understanding now is that it's basically trying to send the IKE and ESP traffic etc over a tunnel that doesn't exist yet.
 ​
 So I've done a little bit of research and it sound like I have to have a static route that goes to the ISP still, but at a lower priority:
 0.0.0.0/0 Next hop eth1.4 172.0.0.2 (isp) Priority 15
 for the IKE/ESP traffic for tunnel creation.
 ​
 Then have another route for all other traffic (local subnet and Internet) with a higher priority, so local office traffic flows as before and so Internet traffic can pass to Prisma/HQ for inspection.
 0.0.0.0/0 Next hop tunnel.1 Priority 10
 ​
 The tunnel traffic is also using BGP, the traffic to the ISP is not.
 ​
 Any insight and/or corrections welcome! Thank you all in advance!

 I'm in the process of deploying a new 2-tier PKI so will consist of a Root CA and subordinate CA. I've done plenty of research around recommended validity periods for Root CA and subordinate CA - however I've recently read up on the Y2038 bug.
 The idea was to deploy the new Root CA with a validity period of 20 years and then the subordinate for half of that period however this will take the expiry date past the year 2038 - I'm just curious how is everyone else dealing with this bug - are you deploying CA certificate with a date prior to this date?
 Reading the bug it only seems to effect legacy systems that use 32bit integer for the time.
 Just curious how y'all are working around this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I posted this to the CCNP subreddit but got no response, hope it's okay to ask here.
 I'm reading the OCG CCNP book and I'm a little confused at its explanation of how BPDU filter works when enabled globally. Here's what it says:
 "The global BPDU filter configuration uses the command spanning-tree portfast bpdufilter default, and the port sends a series of 10 to 12 BPDUs. If the switch receives any BPDUs, it checks to identify which switch is more preferred.
 ■ The preferred switch does not process any BPDUs that it receives, but it still transmits BPDUs to inferior downstream switches.
 ■ A switch that is not the preferred switch processes BPDUs that are received, but it does not transmit BPDUs to the superior upstream switch"
 My understanding is that when BPDU filter is configured globally it applies to all portfast ports and if a port receives a BPDU it converts to a regular STP port. Applied at the interface and it basically stops the port from participating in STP. 
 I feel like it's just explaining regular STP operation but I'm confused by the wording.

Currently the network utilizes Auto QoS at the access switch level for the end users. It is recommended to mark the traffic DSCP AF41. I am not sure if Auto QoS will mark this traffic appropriately or if I need to create a custom class-map/policy-map. I need some clarification on this statement in the 9300 documentation
 " After auto-QoS is enabled, do not modify a policy map or aggregate policer that includes AutoQoS in its name. If you need to modify the policy map or aggregate policer, make a copy of it, and change the copied policy map or policer. To use the new policy map instead of the generated one, remove the generated policy map from the interface, and apply the new policy map. " - https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst9500/software/release/17-3/command_reference/b_173_9500_cr/qos_commands.htm
 So is this saying copy the Auto QoS policy and create a duplicate with my custom class-maps then disable Auto QoS and apply to the interface?
 I am very weak in this area, any help is much appreciative.

 we are a fairly large organization with a couple of small offices around the world.
 For example we have an office in Tokyo with approx a dozen users. We have a small vSphere platform there which we want to dismantle and go serverless. We have already two EC2 DCs in the AWS Frankfurt region (they are an extention of our on-prem AD).
 Something I'm wondering, we also have offices in Singapore, Manila, Seoul and a few more in the region. So I believe it may make sense to use a single region (Singapore ?) to serve all these regions ?
 I'm curious as to what kind of best practice analysis and implementation (if one exists) I should follow for this kind of implementation. Has anyone gone through this before ? Just trying to see if there is a known practice I should follow.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There is currently a rule on the Cisco ASA 5555 that allows HTTPS traffic to the FQDN xyz.com (example) for server. The connection once works and once does not work. I was able to determine that the public FQDN resolves to a lot of public IPs from different subnets. The ASA does not always have the IP address in the DNS cache to which the FQDN on the server was resolved. Server and the ASA have exactly the same DNS server set up. Unfortunately, I am unable to obtain a complete list of the IP addresses of the subnets to which the FQDN is resolved, so traffic needs to be filtered to FQDN. I have noticed that the FQDN on the server changes every 30-40 seconds or so, and on the ASA in the DNS cache I see a TTL for the FQDN of up to 2 minutes. Does anyone have any idea how to solve this so that in the DNS cache on the ASA the FQDN address is always the same as on the server? I know that the server first resolves the FQDN and then with the IP address it gets from DNS it goes to ASA. The ASA must have there the IP address to which the FQDN on the server was resolved.

 I hope you're all have a great Sunday. I was wondering if there's a place I can practice/learn how to better write networking documentations? Currently lined up for a position, one of things they'd want me to do is document the infrastructure.
 Is there a place I can learn technical writing focusing on networking? I'd say I'm about average but would like to hone this skill even more. I can already see this skill being extremely valuable in any technical field I go to. It would be a great investment to myself.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the old days you could remove the battery and the laptop would run just fine from the mains. However, these days most of them are integrated. 
 I’ve noticed with my work Dell, that when under heavy load, it drains from the battery as well as the mains. At first I thought there was something wrong with it, but apparently this is normal for modern laptops and makes sense as it saves on money for the manufacturer as they can use a weaker power supply and regulators. 
 In addition, I’ve noticed that if the battery dies completely, the laptop won’t switch back on for five or so minutes until the battery has charged a bit even though the power cable is plugged in - just like a flat phone…
 So is the battery now essential? I’m asking partly because I wonder what will happen to certain laptops in a few years once the battery is fully aged and useless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been working with some network automation over the last while at my organization. The senior tech's haven't enabled HTTP on any of the network appliances because as far as they're concerned, it simply expands the attack surface to yet another port on the device when SSH, NETCONF, and SNMP are open. 
 I've been working with Python and Ansible to script some automated actions and generate reports for certain bits of data, but now I'm genuinely curious. 
 Ansible has the ability to utilize either netconf (XML via SSH), restapi (HTTP API), or network_cli (CLI via SSH) for its connection method to the devices. In the same vein, I can use Netmiko (CLI via SSH) or NAPALM (HTTP API) when using Python/Nornir.
 Our monitoring tools make extensive use of SNMP. This includes DNAC pushing downstream changes. 
 Q: What are the immediate benefits to enabling HTTP within the direct scope of network automation and API usage? Can it be reasonably boiled down to "aimlessly expanding the attack surface", or is there tangible benefit that I'm not seeing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm doing some weekend work for a second school district and I've been getting complaints about staff not being able to pull up certain videos falling under restricted. I have the staff OU set to be able to verify and approve restricted content and in chrome device policies I have restricted mode disabled for the staff OU as well.
 It works fine in Edge and when I pull the policies JSON it seems to be flagged as a machine policy override, but I can't seem to find a toggle for it, assuming it's some Chrome browser specific setting but I'm not finding anything under Chrome device policies.
  "ForceYouTubeRestrict": { "conflicts": [ { "level": "mandatory", "scope": "user", "source": "cloud", "value": 0 } ], "level": "mandatory", "scope": "machine", "source": "cloud", "value": 2, "warning": "This policy is working as intended but a conflicting value is set elsewhere and is overridden by this policy." }, 
 Any ideas?
 Edit: From what I can see it's doing at the level of the Chrome application as an HTTP header restriction to the individual machine/browser, going into a guest mode in the browser continues to apply the policy, and I can see the policy is being applied at the machine level in the admin console, but not where the policy is coming from...
 Edit: Changed machine policy at root level to allow, and at student level to disable, which resolved the issue. For some reason it was prioritizing/inheriting the root level machine policy instead of overriding it.

 Has anyone used the Cat8000 as an LNS? Are there any restrictions or caveats
 The router should be integrated as MPLS Edge with IS-IS, MPLS-SR and L3VPN. From the licensing point of view the Network Advantage stack gives all this. Has anyone already gathered experience with this?
 Up to now i never implemented a C8k as plain IOS-XE device.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Before I describe the problem everyone will probably be happy to know that I've already told them to change the hostname of Device B and to never talk to be about this again. But I have a bug up my butt because I should be able to detect where this is coming from, but so far I can't.
 My company writes custom applications that create custom problems. Today's problem is that something is creating dynamic DNS entries on our DNS server on behalf of another device, and the DNS entry it is creating has an IP that conflicts with another device on the network.
 Device A is a Windows 10 PC with IP 192.168.1.100 and hostname Device-A. Device B is some embedded device with IP 192.168.1.200 and hostname Device-A. That's right, duplicate hostname. So the DNS entry for Device A gets over-written with the 192.168.1.200 address and then they can't reach Device A on the network.
 The problem is that it isn't Device B that is creating the entries on the DNS server. We turned Device B off for 24 hours and something still was creating the DNS entry, but I can't find what is doing that. I've run Wireshark captures, Microsoft Network Monitor captures, ProcMon captures, and checked the DNS-Server Audit log in Event Viewer. I can see plenty of entries of Active Directory dynamic updates, arp/LLMNR/NBNS/MDNS queries and responses, SMB advertisements, but none of them are for Device B that I'm looking for. 
 Clearly the problem is that I don't have a deep enough understanding of the mechanisms behind this behavior. So I'm hoping someone can throw some terms my way that I can Google and read up on. Or some articles that describe what's going on. I've been doing some Google searches but I'm only finding generic articles/tutorials that don't give any insight into what I'm looking for.
 Thanks in advance for any info you can send my way!
 Edit: Both devices have static IPs configured, no DHCP is involved.

 TL;DR: What are the real MFA triggers for Azure Security Defaults? Is it sufficient for SMB?
 Ages ago I read up on Azure security defaults (link on bottom), and it appeared to only register users for authentication methods, but it did not enforce MFA use for users, instead only admins. 
 Shortly after the announcement - it appeared that they added a "smart tracking" (per se) that would have users use MGA when it is necessary. 
 With that in mind, does anyone know the exact rules to when users will need to reauthenticate?
 Is this sufficient for SMBs (less than 30 users), or should I use per-user MFA/force upgrades to licensing for Conditional Access?
 I understand that there are many factors, but I would like to understand more in depth. Through testing, I have confirmed that new IPs trigger MFA, but I want to be sure that after some time it get's triggered again.

 Two Domain Controllers. Both 2016, say A and B. B is relatively new.
 Using our VPN appliance and AD authentication, if the VPN connects to A, it will allow users on, it will allow the users connect and read the users group membership.
 If A is down and B is up, the VPN will connect to B but return wrong credentials for the user 
 There's no error messages in DCdiag for both. Repadmin is fine.
 I can setup a user in AD, shut down DC A and can log the brand new user onto a new laptop and it will show their logon server is B.
 I have a ticket with the VPN vendor, but still feel something must be up with B. Just can't think of any troubleshooting. Any ideas? Or any way to test the user with flow or get logs?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I'm building an AD tiered access model and using the "Deny logon on..." User Rights Assignment GPO's. However most guides talk about how you need to include all the users of the other tiers in the deny policy. For instance for the T0 GPO you need to deny T1 and T2 users.
 However, I wanted to reverse this logic. I would like to deny access to ALL users and exclude the current tier users only. Tried doing this by denying all authenticated users and changing the GPO's permission of "Apply group policy" to deny the GPO being applied to the T0 users. But, since the GPO is a computer policy it won't do much to deny users from the GPO. 
 Is there another way to handle this logic of having denied logon access to everyone except some group?

 It looks like its been halfway setup 
 -we have a CoE environment
 -microsoft Flow is under the solutions
 -we have a service account as the creator of half the flows (other flows are the ex-employee that set it up a few months ago)
 -I cannot see any of the flows from the ex-employee, it errors out
 ​
 I do not think anything is actively running in the CoE environment. I ran an audit on the service account to see if its actually doing anything and nothing came up.
 I want to redo the entire environment, as it seems the CoE governance apps have updated since that time the user implemented it. It also was halfway finished, with some of the crucial flows belonging to the ex-employee that it used to belong to.
 ​
 That being said, has anyone ran into this or setup something similar? If I reset the password on the service account via AAD, will anything break? I need to log into it to set up our CoE environment from scratch as this current one is a mess.

 I intend to backup about 100GB of 365 data via object storage, and then a backup store via a scale out repo... We'll be well under 1TB, but still, 5.99 just seems ridiculous? I'm aware that deletion of anything younger than 90 days will result in a charge; that won't be an issue..

 I run Fedora 36 on my home PC and I've setup an Alma Linux 8 VM in work that I want to use as a jumpbox to access our systems however I also want all my special keystrokes to go to that VM like the Windows Key, Alt Tab, Ctrl-Shift-Tab etc....
 The connection to the office uses OpenVPN which I keep running in a terminal on my Desktop PC.
 I was thinking that using XDMCP over ssh would be the way to go by starting X in tty2 and connecting that to the VM but also keeping tty1(my current local XFCE4 DE) available to use by jumping between the two.
 Does this sound like a good idea?My aim is to maximize the performance but also for it to be stable. 
 For reference: My Fedora install makes no use of Wayland at all, it started as the absolute minimum install and I opted for X. The reason being that I wanted to try building up the system only with packages I needed as I went along.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Preface: I’m by no means a cloud engineer, just someone who has to support cloud infrastructure from time to time. 
 I’ve seen quite a few companies in which majority of the infrastructure is hosted in AWS but are still utilizing services from Microsoft such as Intune, Office 365 suite, AD connect, etc. The companies I work with traditionally have only Windows Servers along with a few custom apps their developers manage and maintain. To me, it seems more rational to host everything in Azure instead of splitting services out between the two platforms. Any ideas on the rational here?
 Edit: I’m aware that there may be cost difference and such but from my experience, Azure and AWS seem fairly similar in regards to pricing and data center locations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A slight rant, but curious how common this is as it’s the first time it has happened to me in 22 years of software purchasing. 
 We had been using a particular piece of software for phishing simulation exercises for 4 years, but when Microsoft introduced their own version of campaigns within 365 admin centre I decided to use that, and not renew the paid product. 
 So, when the renewal hit my inbox some 2 months before the current licence term was up, I told them that I we did not wish to renew. 
 However, they insisted that we were under contract as we hadn’t given them 3 months notice to cancel. I tried speaking to the account manager and even to their legal dept, but they insisted that we pay. I tried to negotiate a smaller termination fee based on us not using it for around 18 months but they wouldn’t budge and finance eventually paid after I had it in writing that it would not auto renew next year. 
 I just found the whole experience really shitty customer service from them and would never recommend them or a company that operates the same.
 //edit. Since a few have asked. The company in question is Metacompliance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just going to go on a little rant here, so pardon my french, but for the love of god and all that is holy, please name your servers, your network infrastructure, hell even your datacenters something logical. 
 So far, in my travails, I have encountered naming conventions centered around:
  
Comic book characters
 Greek/Norse mythology
 Capitals
 Painters
 Biblical characters
 Musical terminology (things like "Crescendo" and "Modulation")
 Types of rock (think "Graphite" and "Gneiss")
  
This isn't the Da Vinci code, you're not adding "depth" by dropping obscure references in your environment. When my external consultant ass walks into your office, it's to help you with your problems. I'm not here to decipher three layers of bullshit to figure out what you mean by saying your Pikachu can't connect to your Charizard because Snorlax is down. Obtuse naming conventions like this cost time, focus and therefor money. I get that it adds a little flair to something sterile and "dull", but it's also actively hindering me from doing a good job. 
 Now, as a disclaimer, what you do in the privacy of your own home is not my business. If you want to name your server farm after the Bad Dragon catalog, be my guest, you're the god of your domain. But if you're setting up an environment to be maintained by a dozen or so people, you have to understand that not everyone will hear "Chance" and think "Domain Controller".

 I've created a small proof of concept using netbox as a single source of truth and Ansible running on AWX as our automation controller. This is suboptimal as there is no Ansible role/collection for the Nokia ISAM FD series. Developing one would mean substantial costs in allocated engineering time.
 Before commiting to this model I'd like to know what automation concepts you folks use in your networks. Have you got multi / single vendor concepts, what software do you use, how do you handle (legacy) devices which are not supported by the automation software? Do you use monolithic or vendor specific solutions or do you use a stack of different solutions communicating by API? If possible please put the model in context of how many devices are automated, and how large the supporting team is. 
 Many thanks!!

 I am looking for a best bang-for-buck solution - be it refurbished or otherwise - of a server for the following uses.
 It can hold hyper-v with 3 x VM's. 
 A VM for "us" so basically a jumpbox for our techs to work from (want DC access only when absolutely necessary).
 A VM for basic file backups (to supplement our cloud solution)
 A VM for testing - so if we want to test a login before handing it out, we have a prebuilt vm to test login etc.
 That's all, and none of them have to run super speedy or anything.
 Finally, it must be low footprint, to fit into a locked cabinet. It can either be small or a rack mounted item.
 I've literally never used a mini server... so not sure what might fit these needs.

The most rewarding jobs I have undertaken in the past are going into an AWS environment and saving money on cloud spend and optimising the best performance for less money! 
 It's a great value add for any organisation. 
 Alot of the organisations spend more on fancy tools to try and save money on Monthly cloud spend which I think is pointless as it often outweighs the cost of the money they try and save. Also I have seen tools that don't even check the basics. The data is already there for you in AWS and it's simply a case of extrapolating it using a bit of engineering time which you pay for anyway and the result is that you can often save more money! 
 Certainly I have seen it a lot here in Reddit, Cost is becoming ever more prevalent in many AWS environments. 
 Two things to mention, There are copies I will give away for free to those engineers who will agree to read it and implement the savings ideas in their environments and give me feedback and comments, So it would be good to see how much you saved over a month. It would be interesting to gauge feedback. 
 I have to spend a bit of time mentoring Juniors in the past so I know especially at the moment how the job market is. So I will give away free copies to Junior engineers looking for ideas how to break into the market and some handy tips to increase your chances of standing out when going to for an interview. 
 If you feel this is you, Feel free to DM me. 
 Anyway without giving too much away, I have produced a guide for it here.

 So, I was planning to take off the password on my laptop because my brother will use it so he will not call me every time. I dont know what I did but I managed to change my only account on the laptop to local guest user from administrator. Now, there are things that I cannot access becuase it says it needs the approval of admin.
 Usually there will be a prompt like, "Do you want to allow this app to make changes on your device" and it has an option of "Yes" or "No", but since there is no admin now, it only has "No".
 I'm stupid I know (lol) but i dont know what to do. hahaha. Highly appreciate it if somebody can suggest what I need to do. Thank you :)
 edit: I have the windows 11 now

 I have just done an audit of local accounts on servers and noticed a jdkadmin account on one. Appears to be a full admin on the server.
 Doing a google it could be a java account. According to logging, the jdkadmin account has been there for a few days. This server has an internal only web app on it so could be java related. Also has Firefox on it and Chrome. External access is via reverse proxy in Azure.
 As a precaution, I have changed all domain admin accounts, audited the admin usage accounts, and changed all 30-odd service accounts. Also changed the ADMINISTRATOR accounts and made sure it hasn't been used. Also revoked all VPN credentials from third-party support companies and suspended all their accounts just in case.

 Hard decision has to be made -
 Should we buy $1,000 desktops + $1,000 laptops? or forget the desktops and spend the full $2,000 on laptops with docking stations and use it like a desktop with employees taking it home when needed.
 The desktop+laptop option seems enticing but having twice the equipment to keep track of, maintain, keeping track of files on two devices... could get messy, at least compared to just having the simplicity of one laptop for everyone.
 We're looking to get 5 years out of the equipment. What would your preferred set up be for work if you had the option? what makes the most sense? Are surface pros with docks worth considering?

 There are two sets of switches. 
 One set of switches has multimode transceivers with duplex multimode patch cables plugging into the fiber patch panel at each end on pair 1. 
 The other set of switches are using single mode transceivers with duplex single mode patch cables and plugged into the same patch panel using pair 2. 
 I can confirm that they are from the same cable. (6 wires that make 3 pairs). 
 Both setups work. How is that possible running over the same type of fibre? Assuming the fibre in between the patch panels is single mode, then multimode should not work or vice versa correct?

 I don't know if I'm googling the correct terms, as I couldn't find any good resources on this topic.
 My first idea was setting up nagios or librenms or something and just use active checks for this. Curling EICAR test file or setting up tcp checks for certain ports / destinations and stuff.
 Am I on the right track for this? Is there dedicated software for this purpose?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am banging my head, trying to figure out what license I should use where we want to have a bunch of different users log in as a specific domain account. If we license said domain account, once it's synchronized to M365 we try to open office as of today it will ask for MFA token. Sharing the QR code for the authenticator on employee's phones is a no go and likely breaks EULA. 
 has anyone else had this issue? If so, how did you work around it? thanks in advance!

looks more Mac like and that is a positive thing 
 snap layouts are super useful
 people are actually using virtual desktops (I did bill virtual desktops as a “new feature” even though it was in windows 10) 
 the simplified interface on the surface seems more intuitive 
 the learning curve is very shallow since most conventions from 10 carried over
 new context menu missing buttons is a sticking point 
  
For the most part feedback has been positive. I haven’t received any hate for bringing things from 10 > 11, when I did receive some hatemail last time upgrading people from 7 > 10. Totally anecdotal, but thought the upgrade being relatively easy on end users was notable.

Client network isolation based on student account for IOT devices (Clearpass AirGroups)
 Multi pre-shared key (Aruba term) or Identity pre-shared key (Cisco term)
  
It looks like Aruba can do both, if you have both Clearpass and Aruba APs. Cisco can do both with ISE and Cisco APs, but I'm having a hard time finding a documented solution with both vendors. 
 I did find this Aruba doc showing iPSK setup in Clearpass, but I'm not sure how the policy is enforced on the WLC side or if you can dynamically setup PSK's on a per account basis. 
 Thanks for the help!

Sure there are things I would change but overall no major complaints.
 Everyone's a little spooked that we will get someone with a bunch of accolades in here that don't know what they are doing, or starts micromanaging way more than they need to. Truth be told we do need a little more accountability and more focused job descriptions - but just a little...
 In the end its probably out of our hands and we just continue to do what we do, but who has been through this and are there any ways to prepare? Obviously we all want to "appear" to have our shit together for a new boss. Some of us don't really care we been doing it long enough though.

 I'm helping setup a new network at a local church. They are using all Ubiquiti/Unifi equipment for firewall, switch, Wifi, etc. I'm wondering what others recommend for how to handle a Guest network.
 People will come in every weekend for a service and we want to have wifi available. Device Isolation and bandwidth throttling will definitely be enabled regardless of the options below. I've come up with 3 options for handling the Guest access:
  
Portal - Unifi has a portal available where you have to tap "I Agree" in order to use wifi. This does not require a password of any kind, which is nice, but some devices don't play well with those type of portals
 WPA Key - We could print a passcode on a sign and post them around the building (it's a small building). People enter that and get on the wifi. Pretty straight forward. Could change the password every once in a while if needed.
 Open - No password, no portal, just join and away you go. Most user friendly but least secure.
  
Just curious what others do, or would do, in a situation like this.
 Thank!

 My question is: Why do they use these random-looking filenames vs. a standard updater that I could allow once?

Might it not backfire in a similar fashion, with people getting used to allowing things to dial out from the temp directory?

 I recently jumped from a 'generalist' sysadmin position to a more specified role within the same organization.
 The generalist position was within a niche part of the org with a small team/little documentation/complex environment. 
 My old boss is requesting I perform both job duties. His words on my replacement "we don't have one we will just wing it." New boss is aware of the requests. He's already looking out for me, wants to make sure old boss does not take advantage of me. These requests were NOT on the offer letter I signed regarding the promotion.
 I respect my old boss, I respect my old small team, I don't want to leave them high and dry... but I'm also excited to move into this specialized role, and I need to spend some time getting up to speed to perform... and honestly, I'm just done with the generalist life, I want to move on, close that chapter.
 Any advice on how I go about this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two issues that I can't find the answer for online. I had to swap out two line cards (a 10/40 gbps ethernet module and a 1/10 gbps module.)
 Both modules are green and have a status of "ok." The 10/40 gbps module's interfaces came up and I allocated all except one to the proper VDCs; however, the 1/10 module's interfaces do not show in the management VDC or the production VDCs that they were originally assigned to.
 The second issue is that on the 10/40 card, interface 7 unlike the other interfaces on the card, is broken down into subinterfaces eth1/7/1 - eth1/7/4. Eth1/7/1 does not appear when I do a "show interface status" and when I try to allocate the other three subinterfaces to a VDC I get this error "Port allocate not supported on this interface!"
 Does anybody have an idea of what the cause of these issues are?

 Sometimes because they don't want to tell me salary, ok whatever. But sometimes I just reply "I'm interested, what's the next step?" and they don't respond. 
 This must happen 90% of the time, and knowing these guys are pulling in 15-20% of our salary and can't even keep on top of replies is infuriating

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've had a long-holding aspiration to become a senior network engineer. I'm making active progress towards that goal but know I have a long way to go. 
 My question is this, though. What qualifies someone as a Senior Network Engineer? Is it just a title? Is it professional level certifications? Is it years of experience?
 ​
 I know this is a very weighted question and will vary based on opinion, but I'm interested in everyone's opinions. At what point do I know that I've achieved my goal? I'm a life-long learner and will continue to grow, but I have to have reasonable, attainable goals (short-term, long-term, or otherwise). Without them being reasonable/attainable they will forever hang above me like a badge of dishonor and no one wants that.
 ​
 Thanks, guys. Appreciate your insight.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys,
 I have a topic to get my head around. We´re a small company - not going into details here - going heavy on SQL servers. By now, we have a small on premise infrastructure (4 Hyper-V hosts) which I wanna bring towards Azure in the future. While I plan the migration, I also want to enhance our daylie routines, workflows and such. The network is/was a mess when I took over.
 Back to the topic:
 Our users require access to MSSQL, create/restore backups and make changes to different databases (I want them to be able to spin up their own databases according to their needs). For now, they install MSSQL Server XXXX locally and use a per-core license, which is working completely fine. My problem: I´m sure the licensing is not correct, so I see urgent need to change this.
 My assumtions there is no difference between licensing SQL Server (Per-Core) on a server system or a client system. 
 So my idea was to spin up SQL servers (Dev, Test, Pdroc) with 100% correct licensing, give users access to it with permissions as needed and ban the locally installed SQL servers completely. Any thoughts on this? How are you guys handleing it if the Express edition is not an option due to the restrictions? 
 Thanks for your ideas, have a great weekend!

 Password Managers provide convenience to the end user and enhanced security for the IT departments responsible for that security. Many also allow you to store 2FA tokens in the same place you're storing credentials for that account, thus removing the 'two device' rule 2FA is built on. So the questions every IT department will eventually run into during implementation will be 'Do I provide my end users the convenience of managing their 2FA tokens in a Password Manager?' or 'Do I disable this functionality as a best practice to managing the security aspect of the 2FA rule and keep it segregated to a separate physical …]]></summary>

 In Azure Active Directory, I would like to change the state of my computers from Azure Registered to Hybrid AD Join.
 As mentioned by Microsoft, we have to use ADConnect to apply this task.
 (In my case, i am using an ADFS server to authenticate our users in different apps and my target (in the future) is to avoid ADFS server to authenticate...)
 ADConnect give us the choice between Federated or Managed domain.
 Even I am using ADFS, can I choose Managed Domain to "Hybrid AD JOIN" my computers???

 I was thinking about things like ZScaler (I still need to look into it) and looking for a DNS service, but beyond that, I'm having trouble coming up with things, so I though I'd see what others are planning on doing.

I joined about a month ago and I have been mostly learning about the infrastructure system here. I am part of a Security Services Department, which mean we provide Cyber Security solution to other enterprise and my team deals with all the infrastructure devices to ensure the connection works. Our department used many different types of hardwares and softwares. My supervisor is quite busy and doesnt have much time for me.Over my time here so far, my team has been mainly dealing with patch update and migration. Since I think I have gotten the hang on the things here, I want to try and initate areas of improvement and make an impact here. 
 I can share some of the hardware and software we used. VPN: Pulse Secure Firewall: SRX345 Backup:Datadomain AAA: Cisco ACS(Upgrading to ISE soon) Management: Servicenow, BigFix
 Other than those I mentioned above, we have also others like palo alto, fortinet , solarwinds , Vmware and I can share more info if you need more with confidentialty of course. 
 Looking for suggestions on areas I can focus on where I can you know help save time/save costs/save manpower. Thanks you so much!

 So in short, do you consider it just another IT vendor, or is there anything in particular I should know about the ISP industry?

 I originally had 2 domain controllers in my environment, DC and DC2. DC is currently not functioning, the desktop environment doesn't load and a bunch of services are crapping out.
 I moved all FSMO roles successfully from DC to DC2 so now DC2 is the master. I spun up a new DC3, and want to remove DC from the environment by demotion.
 This is the error I am receiving when trying to demote via Server Manager on either DC2/DC3: https://imgur.com/a/Kwoswwv
 Because I cannot log into DC and demote from itself, I'm doing it from the other domain controller's Server Manager by adding the server and removing the AD role / DNS role that way.
 Any idea what this error means and why it is showing up? If there is no way of cleanly removing from the environment, does anyone have a document on how to manually remove and clean up from the domain?
 Thanks in advance.

 So what is the best strategy to get 5gbit speed in my case?

And proceeded to go into detail about a small issue he was having (which wasn't affecting his ability to work and showed how much free time they have) after a couple of more interruptions from another 1-2 users he came back in again. That time i probably overreacted and used some choice language, explained that I was very busy and the proper channels he should be using (which he knows but chose to ignore). Anyway, just wondering if it happened to anyone else. Felling a bit bad as I overreacted a bit but was very busy on 3-4 other things at the time

 I have a very strange "issue" on new machines after they have been imaged using our SCCM task sequence build. So I do apologize if this doesn't make much sense... it isn't very clear for me either.
 When you reboot or turn on these new built machines the device tries to automatically log in to an account and says password incorrect. I can't see this account referenced anywhere in the sccm task sequence and i have no idea why its trying to log into this account when the device turns on...
 Is there any way to control this via a task sequence? When a user turns on the machine, I want the log in screen showing only options for the previous logged in user and "Other User".
 Any advice its really stumping me...
 Thanks

 Recently we started building up our secondary domain here at this school for just our department. Background is that we wanna use VMware Horizon and everyone else doesn't. And with "we" I mean "my boss". 
 Anyhow, we set up a new domain (first time for me going away from open source/linux), got a trust with the main domain. unidirective, transitive. Beacuse of privacy laws and whatnot the users will reside on the remote AD, but they are supposed to log in in our domain.
 This is all fine and dandy, everything works alright, except one thing that I have no idea how to replicate:
 The main domain is called something like domain1.school.int but they log in with [user@school.int](mailto:user@school.int)
 now our domain is also underneath school.int like this: domain2.it.school.int 
 I want to be able to login with the same [user@school.int](mailto:user@school.int) that they can in their domain, all that works now is domain1\Username or [user@domain1.school.int](mailto:user@domain1.school.int) 
 what exactly am i looking for to do that?

 We require a CAA record. We use Sectigo, so I assume our records will look something like this (as per the Sectigo FAQ):
 0 issue "sectigo.com"
 0 issuewild "sectigo.com"
 I'm not entirely sure if Sectigo wants these 2 records or just one of them; their FAQ is a bit vague? Input much appreciated.
 Is there anything else I should keep in mind adding these records?
  
I understand this record only affects the renewal or newly issued certificates, so no matter how much we'd fuck this record up right now, our sites won't be affected as of today, have I correctly understood this? This is crucial - Our certificates are present in a lot of places, so it'd, frankly, be an absolute disaster if these records could negatively impact the sites today.
 Are there any other advice or tips you could give me that I should keep in mind?
 Thank you so very much!

 First time here, newbie on networking problems.
 I'm having problems to make an ssh connection from my host machine (ubuntu 22.04) and my virtual machine in Gnome Boxes (Ubuntu server 20.04). After failing to succeed, I relied on the following guide: https://bytefreaks.net/gnulinux/an-easy-way-to-ssh-into-a-gnome-boxes-os, with which I was able to open the ssh tunnel.
 The problem is that currently, I don't know for what reason, the method no longer works and fails me in a generic: "Network unreachable" error. Do you have any idea why? Also do you know if there is a better way to connect me from host to guest using gnome boxes.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I'm pretty new in the sysadmin world, currently undergoing my training. My first year or something is in the endpoint management/helpdesk team.
 Atm I'm taking care of setting up new notebooks for users. Here's a short description of the workflow:
 Supervisor sends hardware request - > I send out a premade mail requesting info about software the user needs - > I install the software and set up their HCL Notes - > hand out to user
 Now the issue is that the mail that I send out also asks for the user's Windows and Notes passwords. Every cybersecurity workshop will tell users that their sysadmin will NEVER ask for their password (which is totally correct, right?)
 Obviously we'd somehow get into their accounts anyway so handing out the passwords doesn't really change anything, it just feels wrong I guess? And it probably actually is. 
 We need the passwords for a few minor settings in Notes and that's it. I asked my colleagues about it and they answered it with concerns that if users did these settings by themselves they'd scew it up and we'd get more tickets.
 My point of view is that I think that this could be done by the users with a well made tutorial.
 I've been getting more and more confused/negative answers towards the password mails that I sent out so it's also a personal issue because I don't want to answer a mail like "Yes you are totally right, however...". 
 How do handle this at work and how could I change this situation for the better? Thank you for your answers in advance :).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I have started to look for a new job, after 10 years within the same company, and are going on a few network engineer interviews in the upcoming week. I am struggling to prepare for the non-technical questions. Specifically "what's 3 of your strengths/weaknesses?" What kind of answers should I give, that doesn't sound like clichés? Like "I am bad at saying no so I always end up with too much to do" or "I suck at BGP, but I am alway keen to learn new things".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I would like to hear what your recommendations and experience of syslog servers are?
 I’m currently running Kiwi Syslog Server but I’m not very found of it so I’m considering changing it for something better. I feel like I’m missing some nice report features.
 Cloud or on prem, free or paid does not matter much. (As long as it is not too expensive)
 I would like to be able to do the basic things like setting up e-mail alerts, analyze logs, etc. I should also be able to set up alerts based on priority, keywords and more.
 I’m currently picking up logs from firewalls, switches, network thermometers, UPSes and more. Less than 100 devices I think.
 So, what are you using and are you pleased with it?

 I guess you could say like a lot of people I have experience in O365, your general Azure resources with very small VM hosted xp, SharePoint, Cloud backups, Physical Networking/Firewalls/Switches, Desktop and Server support.
 What concerns me is on paper it can look like I have a lot of experience, Networking is definitely not my strongest point, but I know all the fundamentals to manage an enterprise network and in general what best practices are. Can I troubleshoot a moderate Networking issue? probably not if it's outside general vlan/firewall traffic rules. If you were to put a Cisco switch Infront of me, can I configure it via CLI? Absolutely not without spending a few good hours googling. I've been spoilt by the luxury of using Meraki and how easy everything is to configure and manage on the GUI that I'm afraid my next gig will be expecting way too highly.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The goal of this process is to give the CPU something to execute in case there is nothing else to do (thus it is called idle ;-). Let’s think about the next situation, we have a process using 30% of CPU, in that case PID 0 (System Idle) will consume the remaining 70%. Also, Idle is the first process that the kernel starts. Moreover, there is a kernel thread of System Idle for each vCPU the OS has identified .
 The reason for having an “Idle Process” is to avoid an edge case in which the scheduler (Windows schedule based on threads) does not have any thread in a “Ready” state to execute next. By the way, there are also other schedulers IO and Memory, which we will talk about in one of the next posts/writeups.
 When the kernel threads are executed they can also perform different power saving tricks regarding the CPU. One of them could be halting different components which are not in use until the next interrupt arrives. The kernel threads can also call functions in the HAL (hardware abstraction layer, more on that in the future) in order to perform tasks such as reducing the CPU clock speed. Which optimization is performed is based on the version of Windows, hardware and the firmware installed.

AD domain company.local
 Azure AD hybrid sync (one way only AD -> Azure AD) for Office365 SSO
  
A new domain company.public has been created for training purposes. This AD is completely separated, lives in the DMZ and this is how it should be. 
 We now would like the company.local admins to have access to the company.public AD, just to avoid having multiple credentials as admins. 
 As AD Federation, as I see it, only needs port 80/443 this seems to me the safest way to implement this without "really" connecting the two AD domains (as we really don't want to have them seeing each other).

Ultimately we want to make it so that users can only login with a Yubikey and they won’t have a password at all. In Windows there is no way to disable the username/password login. So I figured we could just change everyone’s password and then just not give the password to them unless they need it for RDP or to setup their Microsoft 365 account on their work phone.
 So my question is, is their a tool that can do this, or can we change every password using PowerShell?

 We have Always on VPN. Deployed as Per the Richard Hicks Book. Works Great. 
 I am deploying the User VPN and Device Tunnels using Intune
 99% of the time the User VPN works and connects Automatically but the Device Tunnel never connects before the login screen. 
 Was hoping to have the device tunnel connect before login incase the user on the computer changes (EG at a site with no DC connectivity)
 I have a Windows 10 Computer. Works fine. Windows 11 won't connect unless I do it manually
 We also have the issue in Intune where it says it failed to deploy but I can see both tunnels on the machine.
 Sort of annoying as I like Direct Access and it was connected when the computer got internet.

 I have been trying to do some research in regards to switch daisy chaining and unfortunately I have been getting a lot of conflicting answers and I am reaching out to see if anyone here as any experience in regards to this.
 I am working on a property that has appx 20 buildings and we have connected each building together via cat6 cable and network switches.
 However it seems like some devices, specifically the devices on the end of the chain not all but some are having connection issues. I did notice some high ms when i ping the devices around 300 - 800. I was told that every switch kind of relights the signal and that I shouldn't be having any issues. It seems like when i try to access the devices web gui it can take several minutes to load. We have appx 30 switches on this chain.
 Any info would be appreciated it.
 ​
 Hope someone can help me out!
 ​
 Thanks
 ​
 Here is some more details.
 Switches are 5 Port or 8 Port Gigabit POE SwitchesDevices - Hikvision Cameras 10/100 POE
 The switches are daisy chained one to the next to the next etc
 CAT6 Cable between the longest switch is less than 100m.

 Our PowerEdge R710 has an amber warning light on a drive so I checked on the Dell Openmanage Server Administrator. It's predicted to fail but the status is Non-Critical. I want to replace it but I'm not sure which one to get. The current one is a Seagate Barracuda 1TB 7200RPM SATA 3.0Gb/s 32MB Cache. Can I replace it with a drive with more memory and higher speed? 
 ​
 Thank you

 I'm looking at Klein Tools Scout Pro 3 as it is compatible with their toner and they have a kit with the tester and "test + map remotes". What are the use for these? I probably don't need them but I would like to know what uses they have. Also, if anyone has used any of their cable testers and toner, how did they like them? 
 Here is the link for just the upgrade kit for these remotes: https://www.kleintools.com/catalog/cable-testers/test-map-remotes-2-6-upgrade-kit-scout-pro-3-tester
 Thanks ahead of time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Actually feel like an imposter period.
 I have ~2 years of generic sysadmin experience. I got an engineer role centered around power platforms / teams / 365 / exchange (on prem and cloud) around two months ago. I was administering 365 previously and had exchange online experience but no real exchange experience (patching, migrating on prem to 365 and dealing with all that).
 ​
 I feel pretty lost every day, I feel underqualified for this position and am hoping I can fake it until I make it.
 Lately Ive been tasked with automating governance with our power apps platform (Making a CoE environment group that purges inactive groups, sends emails to groups that never had apps/flows made etc). I've zero experience in power apps in general and even after a couple days of learning etc I still feel utterly clueless. For instance, I cannot figure out how to see what the contents are of an orphaned flow, when I share I just get an error about sharing to myself to see what was in the solution flow (which apparently only exists with these).
 ​
 I suppose I'm just seeing if anyone was ever in my situation (went from generic admin to a specialized engineer role) and had success with it. I've feel I'm a pretty competent individual but my God, I have never had job this difficult before. Truly night and day from what I used to do.

Right now if i search what is my public IP it is giving me the public IP that belongs to the private lan, which by way of an ACL or something does not allow external incoming connections. This was something I was told by the managed networks services team. 
 I manually configured the interface metrics in each of the adapter's properties to 10 and 20, with the lower one configured on the adapter I want the public IP to actually be. When I disable the private lan adapter the appropriate public ip is displayed but as soon as I enable, the wrong public IP is back.
 Any thoughts on what I am overlooking here? This used to work but we did some cable management and now it's not working. All of the physical connections are the same as before.

        <updated>2022-10-13T18:45:10.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all, 
 I'm setting up a business 10GbE internal network using a Synology DS1821+ with (8) 16TB 7200 Seagate EXOS drives and two 10GbE RJ45 ports in the rear. This is for a video production company that wants the maximum data throughput to their devices since they frequently edit 4k 120fps uncompressed footage. My plan is to run both 10GbE ports from the Synology to a QNAP QSW M1208-8C through RJ45 to SFP+ adapters, then connect my 8 users to the switch through the remaining (8) RJ-45 ports with Cat6 Cable (all less than 75 foot runs). Additionally, I was planning to connect their modem to the switch using a 1GbE RJ45 to SFP adapter since their current internet speeds are 500/500. 
 My current issue is that I can't find a compatible 10GbE or 1GbE adapter that QNAP lists as compatible with the network switch. Would a generic adapter from FS suffice? Is compatibility required?
 My second issue is future expandability. With the NAS and the internet modem taking up of the (3) SFP ports using adapters, the remaining (8) RJ45/SPF combo 10GbE ports are taken up by the (8) users with RJ45 CAT6 cables. Would the smartest move when it's time to expand be to daisy-chain another switch in through the SFP port? Or purchase a new switch that has more ports?
 My third question is regarding bottlenecks. In each of the computers we have PCIE network cards that are rated for at least 5GbE, most 10GbE. Will our bottleneck be the computer connection or the speed of the Synology in RAID 6? Either way we should have plenty of bandwidth for editing 4k/120fps uncompressed, but I want to be getting the maximum throughput possible out of this system. 
 Thanks so much in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a customer that purchased a Layer 2 circuit to connect their remote branch with the main office. Currently, each office has a unique subnet, which is managed by a SonicWALL device at each location. The customer isn't very tech/network savvy, but I've only really dealt with Layer 3 (networking support is more of a side-service our company provides), so I've not had experience trying to connect things over Layer 2. 
 My understanding (forgive me for my ignorance) is that Layer 2 only deals with MAC addresses, so it doesn't know how to route anything to do with Layer 3 (e.g. IP addresses). 
 Per the Layer 2 vendor, we connected the SonicWALLs to the designated ports on the Layer 2 appliances they installed at each location, but I haven't been able to figure out the appropriate configuration to get the two subnets to talk to each other, if that's even possible.
 Here's a rudimentary diagram of how things are currently connected; basically each SonicWALL is connected to the vendor-provided appliance
 Subnet 192.168.10.0/24 SonicWALL A (Port X2) | Frontier NID (Layer 2) | Frontier NID (Layer 2) | SonicWALL B (Port X3) Subnet 192.168.12.0/24 
 Since the subnets are separate, I tried setting up a static route on each SonicWALL so that traffic bound for the other office's subnet use the interface that's connected to the Layer 2 devices rather than the default gateway, but it doesn't seem to get through.
 I can try to provide additional information if that would be helpful; I'm just uncertain of what would be relevant here.
 Many thanks for any insight and apologies for my unfamiliarity with this stuff.

The site is across the country, so we want to get as much done off-site to save money travelling, hence why we'd like the VPN setup before install. The issue being that we don't know what the broadcast IP of the network will be until we actually go and install it. 
 Is there any way to setup this VPN to connect in a different method? Or does it need to know the target network's broadcast IP to connect?
 VPN setup for remote access isn't something I'm super familiar with so sorry if this is a dumb question/wrong place for it.

 Configuring RADIUS on a Dell S3048 is a complete nightmare in terms of roles and privilege levels. Maybe it's not, maybe I'm just mad cause I don't get it. I'm turning to you fellow networking redditors for assistance *kneels down like the peon that I am*

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Full disclosure, I am not a network administrator, I'm only the director so bear with me possible being an idiot..
 Here's the situation..
 HP C7000 Blade chassis with dual Flex-10 modules. Each module has 2 connections coming out. One goes to one top of rack extreme switch and the other to a secondary extreme switch. The Flex-10 is configured to use both.
 One of the Extreme switches decided to malfunction but not go down hard. So, the Flex-10 still thinks it's there and therefore continues to try and use it (and fails). My guys had to go into the Flex-10 and redirect it all to go to the secondary switch, restart the malfunctioning switch at a remote data center and then go back into the Flex-10 and put it all back. This takes a lot of time and does not help my SLA's.
 I find it hard to get my head around that in 2022, we don't have anything that can determine health of the network traffic beyond a heartbeat. Is there anything out there that you all know of that would work better? I have to have 99.99% uptime so whatever improvements I need to make, I need to do that.
 ​
 TIA!

 Problem is I get near DAILY phishing test e-mails from them. It is just fucking clutter at this point. Hell I got three such dumbass ones today alone. ALso I can't just ignore them entirely because our infosec team has stated not reporting the e-mails using the tool can be treated the same as failing the test by clicking it(though AFAIK nobody has actually been hit by that).
 Is there a good way to tell them that I appreciate the seriousness in which they treat the subject but ultimately are just annoying everybody?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been tooling around in the MS Graph powershell module as of late because it's the only way to retrieve certain bits of data from AAD. It is my finding that Graph (perhaps just the powershell module, I don't know as I haven't yet started to work directly with the API) is likely the most unreliable system I have ever had the pleasure of using.
 - Every single time I load the module it takes different amounts of time to just do that
 - Switching to the beta profile might take a second, a minute or multiple minutes
 - Running Get-MGUser on a larger dataset might finish, it might not, if it does it might take one minute or it might take twenty minutes. When it fails VSCode just reports the connection was aborted.
 Graph has been around since what, 2019? I haven't talked to a single person that had positive things to say about it at this point. Is this the normal experience with graph? Or is it just the powershell module?

Some are to the point where they throw tons of errors any time they open it. I know myself and others in IT have spent countless hours doing our best to assist. Microsoft has said that different Office versions can change formulas or other variables and that likely is where the errors come from. I’ve tried explaining this to the end users that they will need to address the files themselves (fix or recreate. But it seems like quarterly or annually when they need to access some of these problem files the end users keep coming to IT with the same issue that we don’t have the tools, or time to address for what is ultimately an end-user problem.
 So in a broader sense how do you politely tell end-users that the problem they’re having is one that is their responsibility to fix, not IT’s?

My side of things is still heavy on the network and voip aspect of it all. It would be great if it had sharepoint integration but a big plus for me would be the ability for the rest of our small IT department to look through it when needed.

 The nature of the business we have most employees working out of third party clinics or from home, so they usually purchase their own printers or the clinics will purchase these crappy things for the staff to use, and it has been an absolute nightmare.
 Don't get me started with the printer models ending with the -e, where you can't set up wifi or even print from the device until you create a stupid ass HP account. I don't encounter even 1/4 of these type of issues with inkjects from manufacturers like Brother or Canon, it's always the crappy HP printers.

 Should i install linux on a 2nd pc or rather emulate on my 1st.
 I would be grateful for any guidance, tips, books, youtube whatever.

I logged into my account today and after receiving my 2fa from number 122395, I received another from 1-855-909-0331. Hmmmm. Now I am trying to figure out who is at fault here. How did a 3rd party know I just logged into NS in order to send me a fake auth code and how did they know my number? Does NS have a breach? Cant be my phone vendor, for I logged in from a laptop. If traffic was sniffed on my network or pc, there wouldnt be anyway to see the phone number. NS tier1 support didnt know what I was talking about and escalated the case. Hope to get an email from support soon. 
 If anyone reading this could log into their NS account to see if the same thing happens and share your feedback, it would be greatly appreciated.
 Side Thought: Why is NS still using SMS for authentication. They have been around a long time. Would be nice if I could use my Yubikey or even an Authentication App.

 Running Windows Server 2019, no VLANs, no separate subnets, one home router as gateway and three unmanaged switches. Single server hosting all of the DNS, DHCP and WDS services.
 One day I can get PXE working fine, the very next I'm running into constant TFTP timeouts. As of yesterday I had a BIOS system consistently booting fine, and a UEFI system constantly failing. Today both fail. 
 Attempting to deploy a custom Windows 10 image, no drivers. I have both x86 and x64 boot images. Only DHCP option set is 60: PXEClient. WDS deployed as standalone server (No AD), unattended installs set for both the images as well as WDS. DHCP settings per WDS are default (do not listen on DHCP ports, configure DHCP…]]></summary>

 The ISP gave me the following IP information, and I feel like I'm missing something in understanding what to input for the IP, Subnet and Gateway addresses. 
 ISP Provided Info (I changed a few numbers around for privacy purposes):
 WAN IPv4: 3.15.202.216/29
 Peer IP (IPv4): 3.15.202.21
 Lumen Peer IP (IPv4): 3.15.202.217
 I've been testing different configurations against my laptop to try testing the internet circuit and nothings worked so far. What am I missing? 
 I'm probably going to call the ISP later. I just figured I'd jump on Reddit and start to network with more tech people while I'm on this new endeavor in life.

 📷
 About a year ago I created a pretty foolproof way to have a shared Service Account that would still require MFA in the cloud, using some Azure Automation and run as accounts. Not keeping up on upcoming changes I see Run As accounts are no longer an option and am trying to adjust my Script to use the managed Identity that is created with the Automation resource. The way it worked before was the Run as Account would get a few permissions once it was created the App Reg would get
  
Application Permissions
 Select User.ReadWrite. All
 GroupMember.ReadWrite. All
 Delegated Permissions
 User.ReadWrite
  
It would also get User Admin RBAC role. All of these permission were needed to change the password of a Synced up account and also was used to Read group membership of a security group that had all users with access in it so if one was disabled it would then force a password change Now with a managed Identity I understand it is suppose to be easier but am not able to get it to Write the changed password . I assume it will also have issues with the group membership changes script also.
 Here is the only snippet of the Script where the Run as account was called
 ## get automation account: $connection = Get-AutomationConnection -Name AzureRunAsConnection $azconnection = Get-AutomationConnection -Name AzureRunAsConnection Connect-AzureAD -Tenant $connection.TenantID -ApplicationId $connection.ApplicationID -CertificateThumbprint $connection.CertificateThumbprint write-output "Connected Azure AD" Connect-AzAccount -Tenant $connection.TenantID -ApplicationId $azconnection.ApplicationID -CertificateThumbprint $azconnection.CertificateThumbprint write-output "Connected AZ Accounts"

 UK ( https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/microsoft-365/business/microsoft-365-frequently-asked-questions ):
  
Yes, you can mix and match Microsoft 365 plans. Please note that there are some license limitations at the plan level. The Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Apps for business, Business Standard, and Business Premium plans each have a limit of 300 users, while the Enterprise plans are for an unlimited number of users. For example, you can purchase 300 Business Premium seats, 300 Business Standard seats, and 500 Enterprise E3 seats on a single tenant.

Yes, you can mix and match Microsoft 365 plans. Please note that there are some license limitations at the plan level. The Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Apps for business, Business Standard, and Business Premium plans have a collective limit of 300 users, while the Enterprise plans are for an unlimited number of users.

There's no mention of a collective limit on the UK page...is this accurate?

 I'm relatively new to working with Layer 3 and am in the process of rolling out some new routers to some of our satellite sites using Aruba Layer 3 (2930f, 3810m) switches. In my head, I'd like each VLAN to have ip ospf x.x.x.x area backbone so that they show in routing tables as IntraArea (as I think that's technically what they are). 
 However, it seems the 2930s can only support 8 OSPF interfaces? This means I'm forced to use redistribute connected on the OSPF router which makes routes show as External2 (doesn't feel right to me).
 Is this the accepted correct way to configure this or am I missing something somewhere? Thanks!

 I'm currently testing with a laptop into the connection so to bypass any possibility it's something internal
 Ethernet shows connected at 100Mb Speed test results from https://www.speedtest.net/ show download speed in the 20-50Mb, upload looks better as we get 75-90 sometimes. A speed test via Google gets similar download speeds.
 Is there a better tool for checking speed? 
 I understand we won't get 100Mb and that they only offer the speed within their own network but I'd hope to be getting faster speeds than what we have. We've not used Vodafone before and this is not a good experience so far, support has pretty much got me to run ping on the laptop for a few minutes - thankfully this is a backup connection.

 Context is I need to set the ecs cluster instance IP as a var inside all containers for specific logging requirements. The instances rotate frequently for new upgrades etc so the ip changes hence this needs to be automated.
 I've tried a bunch of stuff, and aws even provide a Metadata file that's accessible in all containers for this but I'm unable to retrieve this in a system wide environment variable and it looks like ECS doesn't support this and just passes in the var as a literal string even though it's using docker under the hood and it works in docker fine. 
 I've tried using entrypoint and command parameters and can export variables but this isn't system wide in the containers and they need to be sourced from file or require an interactive shell login e.g /etc/environment or /etc/profile etc
 Any ideas would be appreciated!

 I am not sure if this is right community for my question but maybe someone will be able to comment.
 I am working with 5G enabled technology and I was wondering if there exists any networking device that is compatible with 3GPP release 16 5G network (similar to this https://mikrotik.com/product/chateau_5g_ax but would support rel.16 features). Since release 16 is probably not rolled out by mobile network operators I was wondering if it is even possible to buy rel.16 compatible device in advance. My concerns arise from specific features promised by 3GPP rel.16 for example Integrated Access and Backhaul, CV2X (Cellular-Vehicle-to-Everything) which doesnt sound like regular 5G features therefore would require specific modems, right? Another thing is that for example Mikrotik on its product page doesnt even specify specific 3GPP release, only available 5G bands which I think indicates that this release doesnt even matter and this model will be compatible with future versions of 5G. Is that correct?
 I guess my question boils down to - is there any public information from MNO vendors wheter these 3GPP features will even be enabled and if they will be - can I buy hardware for it in advance?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 Throwaway for reasons.
 Posting here as a fallback in case anyone else is seeing this.
 I work for a small-medium MSP and we have a data center where we host customer servers on a Windows Failover Cluster.
 In the last month or so we are seeing (seemingly randomly) RDS Session hosts reporting "offline" in our RMM.
 Notes / Symptoms
  
You can still ping the server (internally)
 You CANNOT browse to any UNC Share (C$, Admin$ etc)
 The FO Role is still "Running" you can open a console session however it will not authenticate to the DC (Domain not available)
 All current users are kicked from the session host
 It DOES NOT happen to all session hosts at once (ie in a farm of 5, 1 will go offline and the others remain online)
 We THINK it is related to Sophos, uninstalled and the issue does not occur (it occured once but we are taking that as a one off)
 Seemingly not related to a Windows Patch
  
Environment(s)
  
Server 2019
 FSLogix with dedicated profile server
 AV Sophos Intercept X Advanced
  
The only way to get it back is to hard power the role down in FO Cluster Manager and then back on, it comes back up fine as if nothing happened.
 Currently we are shifting problem customers/servers to our VMware farm which seems a lot more stable but this is not really something we can do quickly.
 Anyone else seeing this at all? MSFT and Sophos are being very little help indeed, but we are plugging away with them in any case.

 When I was at secondary / high school, my ICT lessons were always the best. It was a time where I did 20% work, and 80% trying to exploit the system to gain some sort of advantage over the other standard student accounts. Now, I wasn’t doing this for any malicious intent, just for personal satisfaction. 
 Our school had everything very locked down as most did for a student. The limitations were as I would compare to an exam/ kiosk type account at the time. One IT lesson, I was looking at the pxe boot options and found they were using SCCM. I was hit with a login screen and almost admitted defeat. I thought, what the hell and tried my student details. They worked 
 Turns out the sysadmins had just added the \domainusers group to authenticate. Once launched, I was able to re deploy a Windows environment and more notably to me at the time, create a local admin account. Once I found this out, I was able to sit at my allocated computer and happily install all the programs I wanted and hide my tracks. ICT lessons then turned into 100% fun. 
 One day, I got caught out by a teacher remotely viewing my screen and got called to the IT office. Had to explain what I had done and instead of a slap on the wrist, I was praised for finding the exploit! 
 2 years after I left the school, I then got a job as a system admin at the same school and even used that scenario to my advantage during my interview. 
 And we all lived happily ever after!

 Lately at my company, we have a bunch of mails that are send from our own mail server to someone of us, where the mail is detected as spam by our antivirus software. Upon inspecting the source code of the mail itself, we found the following.
 <a [href=mailto:name@domain.com](mailto:href=mailto:name@domain.com)><span lang=FR-LU>[name@domain.co](mailto:name@domain.co)</Span><span lang=NL-BE>m</Span>
 Visually it will write [name@domain.com](mailto:name@domain.com) but behind the stage it's writing [name@domain.co](mailto:name@domain.co) span span m which doesn't make sense.
 In a normal case it should write this instead.
 <a [href="mailto:name@domain.com](mailto:href="mailto:name@domain.com)">[name@domain.com](mailto:name@domain.com)</a>
 Does anyone have some ideas as to why this is happening?

 What i am asking is if i lose uplinks towards the spine, i am very likely to stop forwarding vxlan traffic on the leaf that lost uplinks.
 Cisco states you could have a l3 link between the leafs ( System nve infra-vlans )

 I know it's been asked a million times but wanted some fresh insight.
 We are a small business, 15TB of data on our server. After migrating servers I was made aware of crashplans terrible speeds...
 I searched other posts and a lot of people reccomend Backblaze.
 We only pay ~$18 a month for Crashplan, with Backblaze it would be about $75 a month for storage alone, with another $20 a month (I believe) for something like cloudberry to pair with Backblaze.
 It's a pretty extreme price jump, and considering our office is in Australia (Blazeback is US based), would you guys have any suggestions?

 This has ruffled feathers with some of the more seasoned end users, who get frustrated with us and sometimes even get snarky when they find out that a license has been deactivated and they’re now expected to change a workflow. 
 While I’m now in a senior position, I spent many previous years in pure HelpDesk getting here and I’ve come to realize that that I’ve got the hero, people pleaser DNA inside of me. I pride myself on exceeding expectations and giving end users the best service I possibly can. On the flip side, I struggle a lot with conflict or disappointing end users to the point that it gives me anxiety. 
 I’ve come to realize now that saying “No” is a critical skill I need to get better at if I want to grow further in my career. I know that you can’t please everyone, and often the company you work for is going to expect you to enforce policies whether you personally agree or not. 
 Does anyone have any insight, advice or strategies on how I could get better at this kind of thing? Thanks!

I click smart card and it shows "Insert a smart card" but doesn't seem to be reading it (no certificates pop up). 
 I believe I enabled the correct GPO settings, since I'm able to connect to the RD Gateway:
 -Force the reading of all certificates from the smart card
 -Turn on Smart Card Plug and Play Service 
 Is there something I'm missing?

Typically when I see that the email server is some random VPC or a compromised host, but today I encountered one involving a thirdparty_with_typo.com hosted on Exchange online, and targetcompany_with_typo.com hosted on G Suite. 
 I reported both to their registrars, and then went to look into reporting the G Suite and M365 tenants themselves and found that a bit more interesting.
 For G Suite I couldn't even find where to do it (everything seemed to point towards individual gmail accounts, not G Suite), and for Microsoft I found https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/engage/cars - but they closed the case after a couple minutes stating:
  
The activity reported is associated with a customer account within the Microsoft Azure service. Microsoft Azure provides a cloud computing platform in which customers can deploy their own software applications. Customers, not Microsoft, control what applications are deployed on their account.
  
So, does Microsoft not actually care about crimes committed using their services, or did I just luck into the wrong support rep responding and closing without understanding.
 FWIW too, the one on Exchange online is spoofing a massive global company (250k+ employees) registered about a month prior to the target, so I wouldn't be surprised if my guys weren't the only ones targeted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Opinion & Advice - Cloud / Network
 Hi All! I’ve got a bit of a decision to make….stay in my current role or move out.
 I have a significant background in networking (17yrs) and transitioned to a leadership position as a manager of the network team at my current company. 
 Recently, I was given an opportunity to transition from networking to cloud due to an organizational re-alignment. So I’ve been spending my recent days learning our Cloud platform, Terraform, CI/CD, etc….
 I knew this was going to be a big challenge - but it would come with big opportunities - especially for future growth. It’s been less than a year and things aren’t going great in the role. I have a new leader and everything just feels disorganized and faltering. Our Cloud strategy isn’t strategic and i feel like im fighting against the tide (ex. Let’s migrate everything..Cloud is simple).
 Even the new direction the company is taking has me concerned about its long term viability.
 I have an opportunity to transition back to a Network Manager role with a different company. I love networking!
 My concern…am I making a short term and short sighted move? Cloud is 100% in more demand that networking. Will I look back in 5yrs or 10yrs and kick myself? Should I stick it out at my current company (10yrs seniority) and hope for the best and gain as much experience I can as a Cloud Manager….which isn’t a lot of hands on exposure.
 On the other hand I go into work each day fearing for my job, I’m not happy, and I’m starting to worry that if I wait too long the job market might shift shortly that might result in limited opportunities.
 Looking for the opinion of my peers 😊

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Just volunteering this info in case anyone else runs into it. I scoured Reddit and every other forum for far too long before I found the solution.
 I ran into 2 cases of the issue this week and tried every which way to fix --- my users' Win10 VDI terminals would auto-lock after 1 minute. However, if I rebooted them and logged in, the problem didn't happen. Then, if I logged out and back in, the problem started up again. Very annoying and tricky to troubleshoot. To make it more annoying, the problem would eventually fix itself over night and the user could log in again and work normally. I'm relatively new here and my coworker said he'd never been able to fix it, confirming as well that it would eventually fix itself over-night.
 Repairing VMWare Tools didn't help either. A complete, total uninstall of VMWare Tools and a reboot completely fixed the issue. What clued me in was reading in some forum about a person that updated their mouse driver and had that fix the problem. Sure enough, that was it.

Not that people can't ask, but I think this might be a bit of an overdrawn topic, and if possible, we can have a thread where we refer people whenever they ask.
 Now, there is no shortage of IT asset management software options available, but the difference between them, or any of them, is that they are either open-source or cloud-based. What factors influence your decision? Simple. Your organization's size, the types and quantities of assets you want to track/record, and frankly, how much money you're willing to spend. Anything else is a bonus. Does it integrate well with other platforms? Grand. Has a reasonable API? You might have str…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've seen a couple of issues where the built-in TDR cable test on a Meraki MS120 switch reports cable length of over 100 meters when the actual length is 40 meters or less. Right now I'm looking at one where a MR70 AP is connected and can only get 100 Mbps. The cable test shows an estimated length of 120.75 meters and no connection on pairs 3 & 4. The tech on site had a basic connectivity tester and showed good connectivity on all conductors. Considering where the switch and AP are, I can't imagine the actual cable length being much over 25 meters even with a service loop. (I don't expect the built-in test to be super accurate on cable length, but being like 500% high is a bit much.)
 Has anyone else seen cable issues that cause such high length reports and know what kind of things might cause it?

 We're getting close to having to replace our current SDWAN solution due to the vendor EOLing the product. Currently we use it to tie all our remote site DIAs into a tunnel back to 2 central sites for our workers there to access central resources, with all the SDWAN goodies thrown in as well. 
 We already have FGT firewalls at all our sites and will most likely continue to use them in the future. Currently we use their SLAs and other traffic steering features that their SDWAN presents at face value, but are the advanced features comparable to a full SDWAN solution that would provide a tunnel back to a central location? 
 We're a pretty big SDWAN shop, I'd like to utilize our current hardware but if it can't match up to something independent like Cisco's or Riverbed then we will have to explore that route instead (I really would like to avoid Cisco SDWAN, had enough of a time w/ that in the updated CCNP).

 Relevant headers from a test message showing it passing SPF (client's domain) and DKIM (ESP's domain):
  
Authentication-Results:
 spf=pass (sender IP is x.x.x.x) smtp.mailfrom=service.client.com;
 dkim=pass (signature was verified) header.d=esp.com; dmarc=bestguesspass action=none
 header.from=client.com; compauth=pass reason=109
 DKIM-Signature: v=1; a=rsa-sha256; d=esp.com; i=@esp.com; s=dkim; c=relaxed/relaxed;

 From: donotreply@client.com
  
If there doesn't need to be any type of domain name alignment, what prevents a rogue actor from just putting their own DKIM-Signature there. Yeah it could be discovered...but who looks at SMTP headers of all their messages. The damage from a phishing attack or similar may have already been done.

 The problem is, I cannot get into the interface, and I no longer have access to the EMC/Dell support portal to get the connection utility. I also do not have a miniDBB9 serial cable to connect to the unit, and those cables are ridiculously expensive. Same with SAS USB enclosures.
 Can anyone recommend a cheap way to wipe these drives so I can sell them?
 Thanks!
 EDIT: I don't have access to a server to throw these drives in. All i have access to currently is a laptop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for some general input as I'm having trouble coming up with reasons for a specific implementation use case.
 Assumptions:
 - All network access requires Machine Auth 802.1x
 - VLANs separate various computer groups
 - Currently we have a VLAN for Corp WiFi and Corp Network (wired computers)
 - Devices at each branch will never surpass a /23 which is what the corp network (wired computers) is configured for
 - Only the devices which also have the access to join Corp Network (wired) can connect to WiFi
 - Max Devices connected to a single AP would be 50 devices
 ​
 Question:
 Is there any reason why a corp devices which connects via 802.1x WiFi should be put on a separate VLAN or would it be advisable just to join them to the same VLAN they'd join if they were wired?
 ​
 I've seen every business I've worked for separate these networks but while thinking of it I can't really decide why this is happening. I guessed it could be something to do with limiting broadcasts but I'm not sure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some of my users are on the road a lot, and while the standard built in antennas on Verizon's jetpacks are OK for most areas, we're having issues in specific spots at certain times of day. Talking to my users, here is what they are experiencing:
  
Still getting 4 bars of service
 Intermittent connection drops (download/upload arrows go away) despite the 4 bars remaining
 Apps that require a constant connection drop and need to be logged into again
 Moving the unit around seems to reacquire download/upload (possibly placebo effect)
  
I'm looking into solutions to improve their connection. What I'm not clear on is what the issue is. Doing a bit of research leads me to believe this might be more of an issue of traffic congestion on the tower they are connecting to, or signal interference due to being in a busy area/time of day, than the connection to the tower itself, since they are still getting full bars but receiving poor quality connection.
 Would a signal boosting antenna even help in this case? To me it sounds more like there's too much interference and/or the towers are too busy in these locations and times of day.

 The offer is for a network manager role at a more senior level. Its again a small ISP, the network needs a lot of work, a full redesign. Which is exciting. Fully remote, occasional on site meetings. I do have my doubts about work load as I'd basically be architect and people manager.
 I've accepted and signed the contract.
 But then, yesterday, another role that I'd been waiting on for a while finally came through. This job would push me harder from a technical perspective, but it comes with no seniority. It also requires 3 days a week in the office and would be far less flexible. Did feel more rapport with the interviewers here. 
 I know only I can make this decision. But any tips on how I make it?! They both have their pros and cons, they both offer good progression for my career one way or another. Can't stop thinking about it and still not getting any closer to making a decision!

 We're in the process of configuring various parts of Intune and currently use SCCM. All our devices are now enrolled into Into intune and are Hybrid Azure AD Joined.
 I’m trying to get Windows Update notification popups working for all our Windows 10 devices enrolled into Intune, but can’t seem to find the right settings. Currently we have the small restart icon at the bottom right in the task bar but we want to have a pop-up notification so users will be notified in a more obvious way. I think the problem is the following setting in the Advanced Windows Update Settings on all devices. 
 'Show a notification when your PC requires a restart to finish updating' 
 This is grayed out and looks to be set to ‘Off’ but I cannot find where this setting is controlled. As these are all Hybrid Joined devices in Co-management I’ve checked through Group Policy and in our Update Rings policy and Windows Update Configuration Policy but I cant find where to enable this setting.
 Does anyone know where this setting is?

PBR has become game changer for us as security guys no more has to deal with unnecessary chunk of traffic which makes firewall use resources to the limit. Now while http traffic between two servers is being redirected to firewall, logging traffic between same servers forwarded directly by ACI thanks to specific contracts.
 We are thinking on what else we can implement on ACI to make life easier. How do you use ACI?

 I have a client who has just bought himself a new mac book running MacOS 12. When I have gotten the device connected into their file shares running on their on prem Server 2012R2. Whenever he creates a folder on the server it will appear immediately, however if he tries to add or edit a file the changes will take up to 3 minutes to show on the server. The changes can take place almost immediately or after a few minutes (almost like it has some kind of polling rate?)
 Interestingly enough if he tries to change a file somebody else is accessing then it will duplicate and show a '°' at the end of the duplicate file.
 I have searched up on the Internet and could see that there were numerous other people having similar problems online specifically with using SMB with this version of MacOS.
 It is worth noting he still has his old mac book that can use the file shares without issue.
 I have tried creating a separate file share and setting the permissions with full access for everyone but still experiencing the same problems.
 Any help would be greatly appreciated. And I can provide any further details if needed.

 in our company (about 240 meeting rooms) we have a malfunction that it is not possible to book a room directly. 
 You mostly get a tentative message back and the Delegates needs to approve it. As a temporary workaround, all users are now able to book any room.
 All the BookIns worked normal before we updated our Exchange OnPrem-Server to the new SU August and activated Extended Protection. We have a Exchange-Hybrid-Environment. 
 Is anyone else having this issure? Thanks for all answers.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I got several cases, where users complain that after Monthly patches being installed they see only one notification from Software Center (Config Manager), it's the last one which gives them 15 minutes to a forced reboot. It was not a case for everyone so I started digging and I found that it happens only for people who use the "Focus Assist" feature in Windows 10 (former name "Quiet hours"). So it was obvious that people who have set "Alarms only" won't see the reboot notifications, but there is also an option called "Priority only", where you can select applications that can show notifications - this works well when the user chooses Software Center as a priority app manually, via the GUI.
 I'm wondering if anyone knows a way to centrally add items to the priority applications list (via GPO or script)?
 The ideal solution would be to:
  
Disable "Alarms only" mode in Focus Assist
 have a possibility to add "Software Center" to the priority list applications

 i need to configure an Domain Trust with a different site which has its own IT.
 I dont want them to see and configure anything on our site/Domain, thats why i want to implement an External Domain Trust - Non-Transitive with Selective Authentication.
 I set it up in my lab and the only thing i dont understand is, how the other Domain should make use of the Selective Authentication when he doesnt have access to our Domain to select the Users which should be able to authenticate on their resources.
 When i click on the resource domain on ntfs settings, i can change the location to the other Domain but will be prompted for credentials access it.
 How can i manage it so the other Site can configure their Selective Authentication without Domain Credentials from my Domain?
 i cant really find any resource on that.. Just some Videos where they enter the Domain Admin from the Domain, which is a huge security concern for me.
 ​
 Thank you!

 My IT team has recently been hired to work at a 1300+ user school and have taken over the whole operation from the old staff. It’s a mix of around 300 BYOD laptops and 1000 supplied Windows laptops.
 The virtual infrastructure is an absolute mess. Blends of Server 2012/2016 VM’s running on an outdated ESXI host.
 We would like to rebuild the VM’s for starters (File/Print, DC1, DC2, NPS) but we’re not sure how to do this to minimise downtime, especially for the BYOD devices.
 The file/print server would be the biggest headache. Next would be cutting over NPS and making sure all of the devices connect up okay.
 How do you even begin to do this to prevent any downtime/issues with a site of this scale?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This problem stumps me and my colleagues to no end...
 I'm hoping someone here can help think this through?
 One of our endusers has the problem where his ethernet connection drops at random intervals, and his Wi-Fi doesn't pick up the slack automatically either.
 Here's what we tried:
  
New UTP cable
 New docking station
 Connected the cable directly (without docking station)
 Gave him another laptop (issue occurs on 2 laptops now)
 Colleagues tried the same outlets/the same cables, and they can work just fine
  
There are no overarching GPOs on his laptop that cause this.
 One thing we saw was that his domain firewall profile was set to ON while it should be OFF.
 That can't be the cause because it was the same for me and I have no issues whatsoever.
 I started checking winevt logs.
 We can pinpoint when the system dropped UTP and the user had to manually connect to Wi-Fi instead:
 A request was made to authenticate to a wireless network.
 Logged: 12/10/2022 11:05:32
 Checked the Security winevt logs; all we saw was the firewall started to check all policies right after the system lost UTP connection. After Googling possible ethernet drop issues I wanted to disable the Energy/Green Energy/Wake on Magic settings in his ethernet adapter to see if that could help, but I can't reach his device right now. When he's forced to make a manual switch to Wi-Fi we have to reverse connect to his laptop and then run an ipconfig /registerdns before we can continue troubleshooting (most likely due to the fact we are in the middle of a DNS server cutover and those managing the transfer are veggies...).
 Even though, these are all things that shouldn't transfer from one laptop to another yet he's had the problem on 2 laptops one after the other now.
 Anyone have any clue on what could be causing this issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I have a UDM Pro SE which has fiber on WAN1 and a 4G router on WAN2 (a Teltonika RUT241).
 The 4G router does CGNAT, so in order to easily reach the Web GUI for admin purposes I've installed ZeroTier on it and it works well, I can reach it from a LAN device (a mac mini) with ZeroTier installed.
 BUT, Tailscale works so much better for me, so that's what I'm using on all other devices (the 4G router doesn't support Tailscale, only ZeroTier).
 My question is if I can somehow bride the LAN to the ZeroTier network using the mac mini as a bridge since it has a network interface for both networks? When I'm inside my LAN using Tailscale I'd like to route traffic to the Zerotier network (192.168.192.0/24) via the mac mini.
 I'm guessing I should setup a static route, pointing traffic going to the destination network 192.168.192.0/24 through the LAN device on 192.168.5.142 (the mac mini), but do I need to do something on the mac mini to make this work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Not sure if I’m somehow missing it, but we’re implementing some 80KM dark fiber and we purchased some 100G 80KM QSFP28 modules at 1310nm. However, the loss is a bit high (no link possible) so we wanted to try 1550nm which of course has better attenuation figures, but I can’t locate any QSFP28 100G modules operating at 1550nm??
 Funnily enough though I have found posts in this subreddit with people saying that at 80KM all DWDM modules will be 1550nm - but the exact opposite seems to be true.
 The loss over the link appears to be about 23-26dBm according to our 10G 1650nm 80KM modules, so I’d expect at 1310 it’s closer to 36db of loss.
 I assume the recommendation would be EDFA, but any other suggestions for reliable 100G over this link would be appreciated :)
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let's put aside the fact that throughout the years whenever I faced a problem with CPU usage/high clock I usually faced a 95+ System idle. I faced similar situations on Linux with 100% of the cases ending in htop (linux command) showing me the exact culprit. If not by CPU usage then by CPU wakes.
 Recently my opinion solidified when facing the highest CPU usage I've ever seen on Windows 10 on my laptop. This time I knew the culprit upfront (broken windows search, confirmed by windows reliability history error messages). Windows Search constantly banged the CPU and failed to start, CPU die constantly at 65 deg C. As soon as I fixed Windos Search the CPU die temperature dropped to ~40 deg C! The thing is the entire time neither of the built-in Windows Tools (including the Sysinternals Process Explorer) showed any useful information on the issue. No listed component spiked to more than 3-5% of CPU. Even the memory usage tab in Resource Monitor was better at hinting the culprit than the releavant CPU sections!
 What are your thoughts?

On the Windows side of thing everything is working flawlessly but I'm struggling to get a working MAB policy on NPS for the IP Phones (This model does not support 802.1x) 
 I have seen a few methods of configuring MAB on NPS. One involves setting up a user with username/password as the MAC address. This wont work in my environment as the password is just getting rejected due to complexity requirements. 
 The 2nd method I have seen involves setting up a connection request policy like so : 
 Conditions: 
  
NAS Port Type = Ethernet
 Calling Station ID = ^00-00-00-00-00$|^11-11-11-11-11$ 
  
Authentication: 
  
'Accept users without verifying credentials'
  
The the switchport is configured like so: 
 interface GigabitEthernet1/0/1 description Access-Port switchport access vlan 101 switchport mode access switchport voice vlan 107 access-session host-mode multi-domain access-session closed access-session port-control auto mab dot1x pae authenticator spanning-tree portfast spanning-tree bpduguard enable service-policy type control subscriber DOT1X2MAB end 
 When connecting the PC works fine, but the IP phone is failing , then the switchport gets err disabled as a result. Is anyone able to advise on where I am going wrong ? Documentation on MAB in NPS seems to be lacking

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm in a bind to look for an elegant solution to get the following failover solution working and I wondered if anyone here might have any ideas? 
 Diagram as follows : Diagram 
 Simple two site setup with both sites having their own WAN link for internet as well as site to site connectivity. 
 The MPLS wans are setup with eBGP so each Cisco router receives the prefix of the other site via that WAN link for reachability to each other. 
 The LANs of both routers are setup with two subnets and are setup using VRRP. with each router acting as the active VRRP group for each subnet: 
 Site1 : 192.168.1.254
 Site2 : 192.168.0.254
 VRRP is setup so in the event of the WAN going down the other router takes over as VRRP master. 
 This means that as well as resilience that both WAN links are fully utilised instead of all traffic just using the one WAN link. All good! 
 The issue is that due to the point to point interface and VRRP that if the point to point dies so site1 can no longer reach site2 using the point to point that you would want that traffic to go out via the WAN into the MPLS to reach the other site. 
 The problem is of course it won't do that due to each of the Cisco routers having LAN's which belong to both subnets. So if traffic was going from Site1 to Site2 then as soon as those packets destined for 192.168.0.0/24 hit the Site1 router then it would just not send it out's its WAN as it has an interface belonging to that subnet which is up and part of the VRRP group. 
 This is the problem I'm trying to solve. A solution which I don't like is to create a EMM script which will shut down that LAN in the event traffic is no longer using the P2P but I don't like how messy that could be. 
 Anyone got any ideas or suggestions then I'm open to them :) 
 I hope that made at least some sense?

I've tried statically assigning the wired endpoints with no luck. The other weird thing is when we connect to the Main wifi, it states not internet and when I statically assign an unused IP address, it then works just fine. We have 3 managed switches that I have tried plugging my laptop directly in and still have no luck.

Will be migrating items from two source locations to M365 GCC/Gov't Tenant as the destination (hence the reason I am migrating to a new tenant). Destination M365 tenant will be cloud only/no AD Connect in place. 
 Source locations and use are:
  
Google Workspace -mail, contacts, calendars, Drive data - migrating using BitTitan (no issues here and the migration is already pre-staged/processing)
 M365 Commercial/Non Gov't Tenant- Used for MS Office licensing and small bit of unexpected OneDrive use. This tenant uses AD Connect to sync users to local AD at the moment and has the company domain name in use as the primary domain for all users.
  
I am planning on performing this migration this weekend and need to confirm what my process should be to either disable or decommission AD Connect from the existing M365 commercial tenant but keep the users intact (just in case I need to manually move any data over)- while allowing me to remove the company domain in use on the existing M365 tenant. 
 I'm familiar on the process of decommissioning AD Connect in full, but know that can take up to 72 hours and I can't make any changes during that time. What process should I be following if I want to make the users cloud only/change their usernames to .onmicrosoft.com addresses from the tenant so I can remove the company domain from the existing M365 tenant at the same time (hopefully in one evening?)

They would like to supply an ethernet wire to the deli so they can connect their switch and other wired devices (think POS / credit card terminal / PC) to said switch.
 From my short research, it seems like I would need a managed switch separating the two networks via VLAN. So basically, ISP Modem / Router > Managed switch:
 > Ports 1&2 for the food store > Add another switch (does it matter if its managed or unmanaged?) for the food store's wired devices
 > Ports 3&4 for the Deli > Add another switch (does it matter if its managed or unmanaged?) for the deli's wired devices 
 Wifi SSID will not be broadcasted to limit wireless devices. 
 Am I even remotely on the right path to accomplish this? There is only one ISP available at this location and they can't provide a separate service just for the deli.

 So I'm in charge of setting up the 802.1x for a new site we are moving to. I work for a company with around 200 sites around the country and a pretty big DC with ACI, ISE, SD-WAN etc.... all across these sites.
 The normal way of doing things like segregating users has been via VLANS and FW rules. However with this new site I've setup and tested an 802.1x config I've done with TEAP for Windows users, EAP-TLS for MAC'S and MAB for cameras etc... all working. My plan was to see what AD group the user coming into ISE was in and the delegate them a VLAN tag on ISE and pass it back to the Authenticator switch, it all works. But after speaking to my lead today, he suggested a couple of things or ways of going about doing user segregation at the new site.
 We have been talking about what is the best way to go about IP addressing schemes for users at the site, do we create seperate VLAN's for infrastructure/networks, finance, HR etc.... with their own subnets or do we put them all into one big range (a big broadcast L2 domain I know, but kit these days can handle it to be honest) and then look to use SGT's on ISE and assign them segregation based off them that way.
 Any opinions or other suggestions would be welcome.
 Thanks everyone

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, we are having an issue when some of our spoke sites that have 2x MPLS circuts (no broadband etc...) and one circut is a higher bandwidth than the other in all of them, I never set the solution up but it is live in production now and if the primary link fails, then it takes a good few mins to switch over to the second lower bandwidth link. There are 2 static routes going out both links (same administrative distance) but the second lower bandwidth link has been set to the "last resort circuit" command and the primary higher bandwidth link is the only link/interface that appears in the routing table.
 In comparison, the same setup is also on sites that have the same bandwidth across both links, if the primary circuit fails then it is a seamless transition to the second circuit and both static routes are in the routing table to.
 Anyone any advice on where/what I could look to change in order to make this work better and for the second link at the sites with unequal bandwidth links, to be able to seamlessly switch over to the second link?
 Cheers

 We are working on a project where a run from the network room will lead outside, underground through a conduit, and then to an outdoor area. This is about 300ft. Then there will be a run from that outdoor area to another outdoor area roughly 300ft out. To me, that is something multimode fiber can easily handle, but I'd like to hear what others have experience with. I know the cost will be higher for transceivers, but this is for a third party client. Im not trying to nickel or dime or mess with a sale for a cable company, but I also want to learn.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've taken over responsibility for an Aruba 6000 48G R8N86A switch that in another state and I cannot get signed in. I have an old config file showing the local accounts with ciphertext passwords, as well as the radius config with ciphertext of the pre-shared key.
 Access-Requests hit the radius server (Windows server NPS) and are rejected with "Authentication failed due to a user credentials mismatch. Either the user name provided does not map to an existing user account or the password was incorrect."
 I am using known good credentials.
 If I change the PSK in NPS, I continue to get the same error message so I suspect NPS client config might have the wrong PSK.
 Question 1. Is there a way to reverse the cipher text on the PSK?
 I attempted to set up new connection request policy in NPS, and under SETTINGS->AUTHENTICATION I checked the box for "Accept users without validating credentials" and then I see Access-Accept sent back to the switch, but the switch still rejects with "Access Denied".
 Question 2. Does this not work how I think it would? Any other way to force a successful authentication in NPS to get logged in?
 I also blocked radius traffic from switch->Radius server to get it to time out and attempt local creds. No documented creds will work.
 Question 3. Similar to Q1. Is there a way to recover local password from the ciphertext?
 There is no remote support at this location. I'll have to drive 6 hours to reset it if needed... Lol

As a network novice, I've been running the uplink line from the FW into switch 1, then another line from SW1 into SW2, then another line from SW2 to SW3, so on and so forth. I know this is not a best practice as if one of the switches goes out then the rest go with it. So what would be the be practice here? I'm using a mix of switches currently, but most of them are Dell 15 series.
 Thanks.

Network design isn't my area of expertise and I'm getting a little overwhelmed with the options available - I had some general best practices questions and requests for model recommendations.
 We're a small business with around ~150 users with primarily hybrid in-office/remote workforce. Multiple IT staff (mostly developers) but I'm the one probably best suited for this project.
 Currently an old Cisco SG-500 stack performs all internal layer 3 and layer 2 requirements, core, distribution, access, the works. Workstations and servers are segmented on separate VLANs.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have an appliance calling home to report input errors.
 When rounded to the nearest thousandth, most input errors are 0.002%. I read a Net craftsmen post saying that anything above 0.001% should be investigated.
 In most cases, the switch is reporting a 0.000% output error rate.
 In some cases, both the switch and the node show an error rate. Examples below.
 Most of the connections are to the same switch; I'm not sure this matters.
  
​
  
 Node Node input error rate Switch output error rate 
  
 1 0.002% 0.000% 
  2 0.002% 0.009% 
 
 ​
  
Do you agree with that threshold for error rate troubleshooting?
 If yes, would you clean only the SFP/Fiber on the node side if the node is showing errors but the switch is not?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm inheriting a job supporting a SATCOM hub network at a teleport. It's a small-ish site that provides Internet or managed network access to a few hundred remote SATCOM terminals via a small number of high bandwidth uplinks. My background is in radio networking (MANET, microwave, trunked voice & data, etc) but I'm fairly competent with Cisco R&S gear.
 This site has been badly neglected and is in acute need of a tech refresh. It currently has about 12-14 access switches and six routers that manage IP traffic between the modems and other infrastructure, and an old ASA that connects to the Internet and provides remote access via AnyConnect. I plan to replace the switches and routers pretty quickly, and the firewall soon after.
 I'm going to write a preliminary proposal to outline the tech refresh project and justify funding for subsequent trade studies and eventual capital purchase.
 Now for my question: I'm a little turned off by Cisco's extremely high prices, the complexity of their feature licensing, and also their super long lead times right now. I have positive impressions towards Juniper and Extreme gear, though my experience with them is limited. Given the relative simplicity of this network, I've wondered if I could get by using Ubiquiti or Mikrotik, but ultimately I think we'll want a paid support option. Assuming a homogeneous environment meaningfully reduces complexity and risk, is there a single brand that might be best suited for this application?

I may be a bit murky on the details but he had a portable standing desk for data center work. From what I remember, it was basically a platform with a single telescoping pole in the center with a rubber foot on the bottom. It came apart easily and packed into a backpack so he could travel from data center to data center working. There was a link to it and it was a small company making these specifically for technician field work. 
 Does anyone have any idea what I'm talking about? I've searched and have been unable to find anything beyond cheap plasticy tripod options on Amazon that don't look like they'll hold up for professional use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I design IOT devices and a feature I’m adding allows my devices to identify one another on a network. The goal is for each device to be able to scan the subnet and find one another so they can show users “devices found on your network” rather than requiring them to type in each IP/host name. I’ll allow typing in for cross-VLAN or other setups, but would like to suggest them units where possible to make it easier. 
 What is the best way to do this? I see this with things like my tplink controller where it can find my access points on the network and suggest them to me. Is this just brute force pinging each IP in the subnet at a specific endpoint and looking for a certain response?
 Not looking for a full on explanation, just need a term or concept to be able to research more into. And looking for suggestions as I’m sure there are many ways to do this. Thanks!

 I constantly screw myself on a daily basis by making assumptions. I can't count the amount of times where I have been handed an issue by a junior tech and started working on more complex solutions but in the end it was something simple that someone forgot to check or assumed was correct.
 The only safe assumption is that no one has done anything correctly ever and everyone is lying to you. Users will make things sound extremely severe to get a problem solved quicker, techs will make assumptions and pass those assumptions on to you. If you haven't seen that information yourself, then you're working off of a paper foundation in the middle of a hurricane. I know this sounds extremely pessimistic, but Dr. House was right all along.
 The amount of time wasted double-checking something is almost never as long as the amount of time wasted trying to solve a problem that you may already know the solution too.

Company is standing up a new enterprise application that is going to be the backbone of the organization. Needs to be extremely highly available and fully support blue/green deployments. The application has a content storage component that just needs to point to an NFS share. Making that NFS share highly available / fully redundant is an exercise left to the implementer, and I'm waffling a bit on deciding what makes sense.
 Solution needs to be fully replicated, clustered, and highly available (instant failover either during outage or during deployments). We also need to be able to support our DR process which currently is replicating on prem VMware VMs to Azure.
 We were going to go with GlusterFS, but just found out that Redhat has killed that product and we definitely want enterprise support for whatever solution we choose. Their replacement, Cephs, seems to be way overkill for what we need.
 Would love some suggestions! Thanks!

 The problem is we don't control what an app (Teams, Outlook, 1000 in house apps, 300 SaaS apps, and more) chooses to use.
 From LDAP alone the apps can get SN, CN, givenName, lastName, displayName, etc. Then you have HR legal name, Peoplesoft preferred name, etc.
 Edit: add job title to the mix while we are at it.
 We just can't force all apps to use the same source. And if we did, the name would still be wrong from the user's perspective many times.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Short version: What is the best way to do a local domain mesh that supports local broadcast protocols, as well as some L2 jiggery pokery on an airgapped network?
 Long version:
 Large scale professional audio/video/lighting networks currently all setup as airgapped switched only networks with a lot of protocols relying on local broadcast for discovery and function. As these networks get bigger we run in to topology problems trying to maintain HA/resiliency/redundancy.
 It gets very awkward when your network is down, the show is stopped and you have a live audience of 20000 people and millions watching on television.
 Most networks end up as a ring (with RSTP or EAPS), or as one long daisy-chain (broken ring). Some folks will run parallel links (that are unconnected until one fails and then the spare gets manually plugged in)
 It looks like TRILL would have been a solution, but it seems that it really never took off, so I am looking at routing solutions.
 Requirements: fast convergence times, once routers are configured the first time: plug and play operation in the field, loop/feedback protection, mesh ability, and the endpoints see all local broadcast traffic.
 From what I gather OSPF/EVPN/VXLAN might be the solution?!? Any other ideas, links or info on configuring those together? Pitfalls?
 For reference, some lighting networks:

 My first gripe:
 the changed the name to Team chat. gag. 
  
there is already a product called... teams. nice move Zoom
 not everyone who i am messaging is part of my 'team'- like someone from a different team or an external person like my sales rep. it would have made 100% more sense to call this Company Chat. 
 there reason for doing this was because people got 'confused' when using meeting chat vs Zoom Chat. So they changed it for everyone because the free users and guest users got confused. lol
  
But this is the part that got me. is this blog post:
 https://blog.zoom.us/work-better-together-with-zoom-team-chat/
 they try to talk about 'toggle tax' and then try to justify not using email and just use Zoom Team chat. This is a major SMH 
 "Need to share an important design and the context behind it with a colleague? Don’t break focus by signing into your email account and drafting an email — simply pop into Team Chat, type up a message, attach the file at the click of a button, and hit send!" 
 Can't say i have ever had an app tell me "use our app to talk instead of sending an email" that shit is funny. who writes this shit.

We had a leadership change and he pointed to the sky aka cloud. So that's where we are, multicloud whether we were planning it or not. It's in better shape than that sounds. 
 It's renewal time and we just don't need the complexity or cost of ACI. Knowing the switches (some of em) also support NX-OS mode and with the reduction in footprint we've had since the cloud migration I'm thinking we can migrate out of ACI by shuffling some links around, Converting some stuff to NX-OS mode and shuffling back. I don't have a fully fleshed out plan but has anyone else done it? You know how it is, if you're doing something you're probably not the first.
 Edit: I know it’s easy to switch between modes. That’s not really what I’m talking about. Asking if anyone has done it and more importantly did you hit your head on the way out? Crazy gotchas etc.

Is this just Microsoft trying to sell Azure and 365, or is it much more of a trend than I initially thought?
 For smaller companies, I don't see any reason not to use Azure, but it strikes me that even with a full Azure AD and Endpoint Manager suite of tools, you still lose out on a lot of configuration that group policies offer, albeit it with other advantages too

 I understand "it's not new it's a skin" and other comments - but really that's all windows ever is since Vista came out... 
 Why is it not in their mindset to create a new base build number instead of just progressing 10.something... especially when it is officially labeled differently with "11" in the title now? 
 I feel like I'm having a stroke running reports and looking at SCCM in general when it still says windows 10 on some things when I'm certain those are 11 machines now, etc... so frustrating. /rant.

 I am looking into refreshing our core switches. One question I am running into is optical vs copper. Most of my current infrastructure is copper, but the newer servers have optical ports as well. Is copper going bye bye? Will there only be optical switches in the next 5-10 years? How will I get cables with pretty cultures to satisfy my OCD?
 EDIT: By optical I mean SFP/QSFP where you can still use copper but many use the SFP+ DAC cables.
 EDIT2: just want to say I appreciate the great responses.

 I currently have a pair of fairly critical ASR1002-X routers in our DC that haven't been upgraded/rebooted in about three years. They're both on asr1002x-universalk9.16.09.05.SPA.bin currently, running in bundle mode and need to be upgraded to asr1002x-universalk9.17.03.05.SPA.bin (will also require a ROMMON upgrade to asr1000-rommon.173-1r.SPA.pkg).
 Can anyone that's done a similar upgrade path (16.X.X to 17.X.X) guide me towards any pitfalls/recommendations for the upgrade procedure? Pretty much every upgrade documentation I've found talks about install mode being the best option, should I convert these or does it really matter? 
 Also with the ROMMON upgrade, can that be done in one go alongside the IOS before a reboot or does it require multiple reboots (ROMMON upgrade > reboot > IOS upgrade > reboot)?
 Thanks for the assistance!

I just want these clients to be able to forward their events. Any ideas? Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm configuring an Intune environment and testing with drive mappings. I have a single Z: drive using OMA-URI configurations similar to this article, initially works fine. But every day it seems to try to remap it. I end up with an inaccessible Z: drive with a red X over it saying the drive letter is already in use, and then I have a Y: drive mapped to the location the Z: drive originally was, also saying the path isn't available.
 I have to remove both, remap Z: and it's fine again.
 What I'm looking to do is a (hopefully) simple powershell script that maps that drive, that I can package as an app instead of a script or configuration profile.
 I can make a script that simply maps the drive with net use easy enough and send output to a file that I can use for "install" detection, but I feel that having a check for the existing drive letter(s) first would be best since there are plenty of already-deployed Intune machines in production that will end up getting this new "app"/script applied.
 I realize I'm "asking for the fish" here, when I'd normally prefer to learn how to fish myself, but given that this is already in production I'm hoping a few of you might have the time and be willing to help me out.
 I can do a basic script in the meantime that will just blanket remove Z: and Y:, remap Z:, and send the output somewhere the user won't accidentally delete it, but I'm sure there are much more efficient ways to do so.
 Ultimately what I am hoping to accomplish:
  
Check existing drive mappings (I've found that it doesn't add a 3rd letter, so can probably focus directly on Z: and Y:)
 Remove existing mappings
 Remap Z: to the proper path
 Check Z: to confirm its accessible
 If Z: is fine, send some output to a text file that can be used for program detection so that it's not constantly executing against the same machines

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Admins!
 I have a situation where I have some clients working from home. Due to compliance, I have to prevent them from being able to talk to other devices on the network (such as home PCs, IoT devices, etc...).
 We use ESET Endpoint Antivirus and RocketCyber SIEM/SOC software. Both of those applications have an isolation mode that prevents that PC from talking to anything other than the ESET/RocketCyber console.
 Is there anyway to achieve this type of protection using only software, but still allow WAN/Internet access (so basically it can talk to the gateway and nothing else). The isolation modes in the applications I mention, prevent general WAN/Internet access as well... so they won't work in this situation.
 However, since they are able to lock it down to a specific port/application... I assume there must be some way to do what I am describing. I searched around looking for Windows Firewall rules, but those seem to be limited to very specific protocols/ports. I would like true isolation like Wireless access points do in Guest mode.
 Since this is in multiple home networks, I don't really have the option to create network segmentation (VLANs, etc...).
 Any help is greatly appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 I'm well versed in remote desktop, having operated several for coming up to two decades. However, this is something new to me...
 We have a customer who's got 30-40 users within a latency of circa 5-10ms to the remote desktop session host. However, they've just had 4 outsourced users added from India (we're in the UK). Each Indian user is around 150-200ms.
 When we have 40 UK-based users concurrently online, the server CPU can sit roughly at 60%. However, if you swap a couple of UK users for Indians, the server CPU will spike and sometimes sit at 90% with spikes to 100% and the associated freezes you get when out of resource.
 Strangely, this manifests itself in a Windows Explorer process taking between 10-20% CPU for each user. However, if you right-click the Windows Explorer process and choose to restart it, the user sees a brief flash on their session as the explorer is reset, and CPU usage dips back to the circa 0% that it normally uses for other users. It quickly returns to the 10-20% range though.
 I was just wondering whether anyone has noticed the correlation between client latency and server CPU usage?

 Why is this always so complicated?

 Biggest issue is that the vendor must be compliant with any EU privacy laws that are in place.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there,
 I wasn't able to find any relevant user groups except maybe for this subreddit as I saw many posts about EATON UPSses here. The device itself is working fine and I am really happy. But some tiny thing is bugging me.
 I am running an audio interface (RME Fireface UCX II) via this UPS , next to a monitor, active studio speakers and a mac studio. When I turn the outlets of this UPS off in the evening, and wait a little, I can see the display of my Fireface briefly flashing on and off again - every 30 seconds or so.
 The power doesn't seem to cause it boot up, so I don't see anything on the display, just the backlight briefly turning on and off for a split second.
 This doesn't happen if my interface is connected to a different wall socket next to the EATON UPS.
 I have the EATON Ellipse ECO 1200W
 Is this anything to worry about? Can this cause wear on the electronics on high-precision audio devices like these?
 Already sent an email to EATON customer support but you know how these things are - sometimes you hear from them, sometimes you don't. Curious to hear your input on this!
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had a call yesterday with AT&T, during which they were trying to sell me on their "new" Switched Ethernet solution to replace our DIA fiber. (We have multiple locations - most of which have 50mb fiber as the primary connection and some flavor of cable or non-dedicated fiber as the backup.) The proposal looked promising and would save us around $200/mo per location. There would be no managed router, and supposedly I would get an online portal where I can throttle speed in real time. Not a huge need, but an interesting proposition, none the less. Of course, the ATT rep couldn't/wouldn't give me any other 'cons' that might be an issue and even said they could get us out of our current contracts and give us the same or better SLAs that we have now.
 So, I come to you, good people of Reddit. Who has experience with this ASEoD product, can offer insight as it compares to DIA fiber, or any other advice along these lines. Have you used this portal they speak of? Is it awesome or meh? Pros? Cons? TIA

 I am again in the position to generate another 1000 free places on my Udemy JNCIA course, I have been asked why I am offering it free to Reddit / LinkedIn ect and its because if I can give away the course that will benefit others.
 Some instructors just post their courses on giveaway sites and end up getting enrolments that are never used, I want to offer it to people that might at some point have a look and maybe find it useful.
 As a new instructor myself I have found the feedback to be most helpful and once my other courses are completed, they will be offered free to.
 Any feedback is welcome.
 The below code is valid for 5 days however once signed up you have the course for life.
 I thank you in advance and good luck in your studies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So let me preface this by saying that this is absolutely their choice and I'm not going to try to stop them, I just want to see if there is an alternative.
 The company I work for has been purchased by another company in another continent. It's a really good business move for all involved. We're now talking about the collaboration between our IT departments, and they would like to migrate into their 365 tenant, which they have done for all of their previous acquisitions.
 I don't inherently have an issue with this, but we are considerably larger than their previous acquisitions, and utilise O365 a lot more than these smaller companies (and it sounds like we utilize more than the new parent does with regards to Azure and Intune/Autopilot, etc.).
 I did a very brief stint at an MSP before working here, and there we used some kind of Partner Portal to look after all of our 365 tenants. Is this something that the parent company can do and onboard our tenant as a whole, separate entity? I thought this was the case, but the more I look at it, the more it looks like the Partner Centre scheme is something for resellers (which the parent isn't, but the aim is for them to provide licences to us, along with collaboration on projects, so there might be some overlap there).
 Am I barking up the wrong tree here and have the wrong idea about the Partner Centre? Is there something else I should be looking at and have been searching for the wrong terminology? Or is them merging us into their tenant the best practice here?

 So all OK so far, Preview updates by default are not pushed to WSUS.
 But If we have Azure VMs, and they use Azure Update Management and for the repository they use Microsoft Update, we will probably get this "Preview" updates by default or not?
 Since we want to get rid of WSUS for the Azure VMs, what will actually happened...?
 If we have for example test environments on WSUS which are without "Preview" updates and then for production use Azure, we are going to have different updates installed there... How do you solve this in your environments, should we also deploy WSUS to Azure, or include preview updates on test environments?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have been struggeling with the Windows startbutton not working on our RDS 2019 servers for a while now. The weird thing is, this only happens for regular users, not admin users. I have been searching online and found that I could run the following command: 
  
Get-AppXPackage -AllUsers | Foreach {Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode –Register “$($_.InstallLocation)\AppXManifest.xml”} 
  
This doesn't work for me because it gets blocked by applocker. Also in the eventviewer under 'Applications and Service Logs/Microsoft/Windows/AppXDeployment-server' I see a lot of errors regarding packages that cannot be installed/updated due to applocker restrictions. Example of the error: 
  
AppX Deployment operation failed for package Microsoft.Windows.SecHealthUI_10.0.17763.3232_neutral__cw5n1h2txyewy with error 0x80073D01. The specific error text for this failure is: error 0x800704EC: Deployment of package Microsoft.Windows.SecHealthUI_10.0.17763.3232_neutral__cw5n1h2txyewy was blocked by AppLocker.
  
I tried to allow the packages in our applocker GPO and reboot the servers, but that didn't fix the issue either.

 I also tried to delete the firewall rules in the registery, but that does not seem to work either.

With Windows 10 of course, we would Azure register the device and use MAM in Intune/Endpoint Manager with Windows Information Protection. And of course on iPads, iPhones, and Android phones, there's app policies available too
 Obviously this is not something we can do with Mac. And as it's a BYOD laptop, we are not at liberty to lock the entire laptop down. Is there any sort of data protection policy or software we can use with Mac, or are we SOL? They're basically just going to be using Office and OneDrive
 Edit: I did find this from MS, which seems to offer some level of support, but as commenters have already stated, it's just a terrible idea and I'm going to strongly make that point

 Of course, we in IT say that this must not be opened under any circumstances!
 ​
 I am a sysadmin, not a security specialist. Nevertheless, I (and my colleagues) are curious about what would happen if a potential virus is executed or a link is followed.
 ​
 To test something like this, we currently have an old notebook with Windows 7. The notebook is of course not in the domain and in a separate VLAN without access to the LAN.
 We would like to replace this notebook with a new one (more performance, Win10 etc.).
 ​
 Now to my question: do you have a special computer to test potential viruses, malware, phishing links etc.?
 If so, what is your configuration of the computer?
 ​
 - separate VLAN -> no access to the LAN
 - no domain join
 - Office installed
 - 7zip
 - Wireshark
 Have you created a way to reset the computer after running the file? Restore Point, Backup, Hyper-V or something else?
 ​
 The reason for this computer is primarily curiosity and to rule out any false positives.

 We had this issue on HP Elitebook 845 G7 and Elitebook 855 G7 but i think Elitebook 835 G7 will have this issue too.
 Since the release of Windows 11 we are Testing this new OS version in our environment. A clean install is working great an all policies are prepared. But every upgrade attempt from Windows 10 to Windows 11 ended in a Bluescreen. (UNEXPECTED_KERNEL_MODE_TRAP)
 Because we had other project ongoing we have waited until Windows 11 22H2. Maybe the problem was solved in this release but we had the same issue. Both scenarios upgrade Windows 10 to Windows 11 22H2 and upgrade Windows 11 21H2 to 22H2.
 After this bad experience we created a case at the HP Support. After some troubleshooting and sending them our logs we have found the issue.
 It's the Synaptics touchpad driver. 
 When we remove the driver the upgrade is working fine. Now we wait for a response from HP if they will release a fixed driver.
 I will update this post when i receive some new information.

 we need a mail service like mailjet to do bulkmail.
 I would like to avoid using our primary domain for this, or set up a 2nd DKIM and SPF to coexist with our primary mail system, due to "i have a bad feeling about this".
 I guess because i don't want to jeopardize domain reputation, risk being blacklisted, or deal with the consequences of the mailservice being compromised. 
 Which is why i proposed to buy a new domain, with one or two mail accounts attached to it, for bulk mails only, without interfering with other productive mail services.
 A follow up question to this was:
 Would protective services like Microsofts Defender P1 or P2 (or other vendors) recognize those massmails as Phishing or Impersonation? Because there will be <a href> links and images within the body that point towards our primary domain, while the sender address would be from the new domain.
 I don't think that's the case, but since i'm stuck in the overthinking game now, i'm not so sure anymore. Anyone had to deal with this before?

 https://www.reddit.com/r/gpg4win/comments/y0y28b/command_line_encryptiondecryption/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3 
 Hi, I'm relatively new to gpg4win, and am trying to accomplish what I *think* is a relatively simple task.
 I'd like to encrypt and decrypt files from a command line, such that I can script a process to automatically parse files in a folder to be encrypted at regular intervals, or decrypted. I have only one certificate with private key stored in Kleopatra, and it's set to my default identity, and "ultimate" trusted.
 I've googled for hours, read through documentation, found examples, but a few of the option switches that are widely referenced don't seem to work with gpg4win (IE, --passphrase-file or --passphrase_fl, or even just --passphrase).
 Here's my current syntax for a test encryption
 .\gpg -r "KEYNAME" -o testencrypt.gpg --pinentry-mode=loopback --passphrase "PASSPHRASE" --default-recipient-self --always-trust -encrypt test.txt
 yeilds :
 gpg: ypt: skipped: No public keygpg: test.txt: encryption failed: No public key
 I'm not sure if I even need the passphrase for encryption, rather than decryption - but if I omit --passphrase, it prompts for one.
 I haven't gotten to decryption syntax, but figure it will be pretty much just the opposite process. I noticed the gpg-preset-passphrase.exe program, and ran it and entered the password there - not sure if that impacts anything.
 Thanks for any insight!
 edit : using gpg4win 4.0.3

 Our plan is...
  
Use GPO to redirect our user folders (Desktop, Documents etc) to a windows file share using the in-built offline files feature.
 The share will be hosted on DFS and replicated between fileservers across regions.
 Configure folder quotas to prevent users running riot with local files

 First question was : https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/y06smj/sysadminsoftware_enginners_is_this_normal/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3
 I got another question, as i am wondering if this is a common practice which i have not experinced as i feel that it is a bad pratice, or am i wrong, 
 So for example, Customer creates a ticket, ticket gets assigned to wtv team i.e. Hardware team. Hardware team resolves the issues, comments on the ticket saying issue has been resolved, can we proceed to close the ticket, customer comments back about a quey on something that is not related the issue i.e. warranty status of the HD which we have to email the OEM and await their reply. Which will extend the SLA even though the main issue has been resolved. 
 Do you get the customer to create a new ticket or keep the ticket open?
 For me i think it is a bad practice to keep the ticket open, from my experience usually we'd get the customer to create a new ticket. 
 But then again, back then i was working for companies had some of control i.e. HPE, big IT corps. 
 But the new company i just joined, i am still getting used to the practice, and i was wondering if i should address this as this might give the customer too much power to dictate and of course my previous question
 I find such practices bad and is making things very confusing which in turn would reduce productivity.
 ​
 Am i wrong?
 Or should i address this? 
 I dont wanan address something that would shoot myself in the foot

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month's updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft's Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft's updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work.
 Test, test, and test!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, we have had a couple of discussions at work about the concepts behind "switchport mode trunk" / "switchport trunk allowed vlan all". The two commands both accept every VLAN configured on the switch on the trunk ports. So my question is, if there are any disadvantages for network, when the trunks are configured in that way instead of specifying the exact VLANs. We have some delays and higher TTLs in our network and/or some black magic we can't figure out. So my boss hat the opinion its caused by the trunk all command. Is that true? We are talking about a VLAN configuration of 20-30 VLANs.
 Thanks!

 Today, something odd happened. We noticed that old users account that were once deleted now appeared back in AD. To add to this, a bunch of users that were removed from security groups for licensing purposes, were also suddenly added back to those sec groups. The MSP had dropped the ball on doing back ups for the last few months and we noticed a couple weeks ago and they have been working to get their crap together. So they have been in and out of the network working on this. 
 I’m not entirely sure what happened and why Active Directory suddenly looks like old stuff is there and/or reverted in some way or idk, cause it’s not reverted in its entirety. 
 What are some events or things I can look at in AD to help determined what happened here???

 ​
 Would really appreciate some help with AD delegation please?
 ​
 with a delegated user,
 I'm having a problem where, if I keep a users password as is, (for test purposes) and untick the box that says user must change password at next logon, the password is changed successfully.
 But if I access the account tab in ADUC, I still see the "user must change password at logon" box is ticked.
 If I untick and ok, I get that access is denied.
 ​
 what I've done thus far,
 I've created an OU, put some users in it and created a group to whom I'd like to delegate the permissions of change, reset password, read and write lockout time, read-write pwd last reset
 I've also added read and write user account control, but I'm not having any luck.
 ​
 Your help would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all!
 Just trying to get a client up with Starlink - we are using tunnels to deliver their public IP and starlink as a backhaul - this all works fine.
 Deployment testing internally - we just setup a dhcp server and added routes based on DHCP like so:
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 dhcp 100
 And a few other routes back to management IP's in case of tunnel issues
 ip route 1.2.3.4 255.255.255.255 dhcp 100
 This worked in testing with normal DHCP server, but what we've found since deploying is that starlink's IPoE doesn't deliver a default route via the 'dhcp' keyword - i.e. DHCP Option 3 (I believe) and is instead providing the default static route via classless routes (option 121) ?
 The big tell is that a default route is there, but its 254 distance instead of the configured 100, and the /32 routes we added do not get picked up.
 So my question is thus - given we can not get that gateway using the 'dhcp' keyword on the routes, is there any way to kind of add a route for the /32's based on the default route given out in what we assume is option 121?
 I am remote to the site, so can't really reliably debug DHCP without kicking my access off, so any help is appreciated to understand my options.
 Thanks!

 I have a data network that is roughly 75 drops. The installer mixed the runs for voice and data. So each cable is terminated into two jacks, 2 pair for data, 2 pair for voice. Nothing is labeled, and my toner does not seem to work with these mixed cable runs. The toner tests out fine on a standard patch cable.
 Do I need a different\better toner or is this expected on cables terminated this way?

 Next time I'll encourage a customer power cycle before our maintenance window begins. We do have larger customers with scheduled reboots and monitoring via zabbix if it's been too long with reboots queued but this is a smaller division.
 Just a quick sanity check, I have vm console access, I couldn't have chosen 'shutdown without updates' without credentials, correct?
 My other choice would have been to have them shut it down from inside OS, and patch when it came up instead.

 Is there something glaring about Juniper that I'm missing? On paper Junos seems to tick the right boxes of not being a monolithic kernel, linux-based, EVPN/VXLAN support, SDN management and they've been around for decades. I'm getting my talking points together to talk with management about it, but I "don't know what I don't know" so I'm hoping reddit can educate me as to if there is something in production with this gear's operation that someone with tribal knowledge would know. Could definitely use some career advice as, the only downside I see is having to learn something new but I could be way off base. Thanks.

 Having a bit of a problem driving me nuts and hoping someone can lend a bone.
 I've done a similiar setup before and never had any trouble.
 I have two physical sites with an ESX host in each. All networking machines are inside of ESX. There is a virtual firewall at each site. The two have a Site2Site VTI (Route based) VPN Tunnel between them. Over it I'm sending VXLan traffic. The VxLan endpoint is behind each of the firewalls, running OpnSense in another VM. No NAT going on inside the VTI. Subnet to subnet. VxLan link is established and I have a stretched layer 2 segment with the IP range of 10.20.171.0/24. I can ping across it. I can browse http across it. But the second I swap the same test/set of ips for https - I'm unable to browse. In other words, I believed that it is a TLS problem. curl -k -vvv showed it hanging on "Client Hello".
 ​
 Using the same http host I succeeded with but https did not work with, I did a client side wireshark twice:
  
On Net
 Across VxLink
  
For #1, it worked (ie: the vms live next to each other on the same time).
 For #2, last thing client sends is a tls "client hello" and never receives the server hello back.
 I did another wire shark on the server side, and the server hello IS being sent back, just not arriving at back at the client. OVER THE SAME LINK that plain old http (stateful) and icmp work.
 I'm absolutely dizzy trying to chase the packets for that particular conversation at this stage. 
 Can anyone think of anything?

 VMware's solution is to pay a lot of money for vRealize Network Insight. I'm balking partly on the cost and partly on the principle of the thing.... lots of firewall products have this visibility for no extra cost once you buy the product.
 Anyone have suggestions for alternative approaches?

 1) move systems to a different account receivable software that will sending information

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have some relatively old Nexus 5k’s where I work. They are vPC’d together and support fex’s throughout the campus with workstations on them. 
 We’re having an issue where some of the new workstations getting connected to the fex’s, their MAC address shows up in the table as a static mac being learned over the vPC peer link. It’s the same on both Nexuses, they both think they’re learning it from the other device. We can’t clear it out of the mac table because it’s a static (it will only let you clear dynamic), and when checking the running config on both devices there are no static MAC’s assigned to any interfaces. 
 Has anyone seen this issue before, or found a resolution? 
 TLDR: both our nexuses think they’re learning a static mac from the other side via the vPC peer link, but there is no static mac configured.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are moving offices to a building about 200m down the street for... various reasons (dont ask). We currently have WAN links (fiber LES) to the building but the connection is sometimes problematic, and only 1gbit when its working at its best. We are going to be moving our entire office to the building so to ease this transition we want to link back to the original office with the fastest link we can reasonably set up without spending mad amounts of cash.
 We have looked at possibly using the Unifi UBB-XG https://dl.ui.com/ds/ubb-xg_ds.pdf But its not clear if this is encrypted and/or secure. Regular raw wifi isnt an option in our setup, and laying a VPN over the top means a lot of reconfiguration of routing etc. Ideally we want to extend our broadcast domain over the wifi (not ideal but its only short term) to avoid having to reconfigure all the equipment. Also the speed appears to only be ~6gbit on a good day, despite it having 10gbit SPF+ ports.
 Can anyone suggest a better option? Preferably someone with some experiential knowledge.

 We want to use 802.1x on all access switch ports, the problem is that we use different vlans for difference devices. So printers in VLAN20, clients in VLAN10 etcetera. I want to somehow push the VLAN through authorization policies so that users can move printers without having them stop functioning.
 I want to know what we can do about this in an event where the ISE goes down completely. I know that you can revert to a specified VLAN if the radius server goes dead. But I want that for every VLAN we use. 
 Is that even possible?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 We're considering to buy few new DC Internet Edge routers, we need them just for routing, no need MPLS or segment routing, or other 'fancy' features, currently we're using Cisco NCS-5501-SE. But it has only 4x100G ports, which is not sufficient. So we started to look to other options:
 Cisco NCS55A1-24H - it has 24x100G, but limited scale - supports only ~2.2millions of prefixes. The maximum could be reached in a few next years. So this is not very good. Filter all /24 prefixes would be a workaround for future, but it could bring some new un expected problems, so we're looking very carefully to this.
 Cisco NCS 55A1-36H-SE-S - It has 36x100G with Extended scale for prefixes - support 4millions of prefixes, but seems too expensive.
 Maybe you know so other models would be not so expensive as NCS 55A1-36H-SE-S ? Maybe something from Juniper series ? I think every DC operator with quite much internet traffic are having similar head ache these days. Any advices ? Thanks !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just had this discussion and it reminded me that I wanted to raise this point here.
 My current team lead gifted me with this concept - the turd system. A 'turd' is a task that shouldn't exist, doesn't make sense to exist in its current form, and is a pain in the ass to handle, especially in bulk. Turds tends to naturally accumulate into heaps of shit, until either some poor responsible souls goes shovel them, or they get stomped down the drain.
 My team lead is of the firm beliefs that it's a good thing for turds to accumulate, as this triggers the 'turd system' - someone eventually complains that the turds aren't being passed in a timely fashion, and after a few iterations this provides the impetus to restructure or remove the task so as to eliminate the source of turds.
 This strikes me as something that is typical of organizations in general. Dumb shit creates work no one wants to do it, least of all the people who realize it's pointless. If someone handles it, that process never gets reviewed. However, if it's left to break, then eventually decision-makers will resign themselves to changing the process.
 Does your shop have a turd system too?

 Normally a firewall with stateful inspection allows outbound traffic to return unless explicitly denied.
 I have a policy configured with the following rules:
 Mandatory
  
Log all connections - Monitor only
 Allow specific applications
 Block 'very high risk' applications.
 Geoblocking rule
  
Default
  
Allow traffic inside zone to outside zone and inspect.
  
Default Action: Access Control: Block all traffic.
 However, most return traffic is still being blocked on the outside ingress.
 What is the proper way to configure such a policy for a perimeter FPR?

 The site in the middle has two HA firewalls and each site will have a ring design in the access layer. Each site will also have a l3 switch for inter-vlan routing, connected to the firewall in the middle.
 I am wondering if the l3 switches are even needed since the routing between vlans could be accomplished directly via the firewalls?

I think it's better that I disable It for everyone and fix everyone that can't log in yet, so I'll have the next 3 months to think about a solution and re-enable before Jan 2023 Can you guys help me here?

 At work I have a folder containing a indext.html that links to maps and folders with building maps, and maps of patch panel ect. Also pictures of them.
 It works, but has some limitations because if the building changes I must draw all lines again if I want to update it. 
 I am looking for a system of some kind (or html tag) so I can have this map as background and write on top of it as a layer two.
 This might not be very good explained, but I hope it is understandable.

AzureAD > Security > Identity Protection > Multifactor Authentication Registration policy
  
This is not configurable, all of the options are grayed out (I'm signed in with a Global admin account). Not sure why I can't edit anything, the default policy does not let me change the assigned users/groups, all grayed out.
 
 
Using a conditional access policy seems to work, forced my account to sign out and register a phone number (also had phone call and the app as options).
  
When I go into the test user's Azure Profile > Authentication Methods, it's empty. When I worked a support role, I'd see the registered phone number there which could be cleared, or changed. Has this been moved? The "new" menu (blue ribbon at the top stating the "new authentication experience) doesn't have anything either
 
I also can't seem to specify methods, I'd like to remove phone call as an option, and possibly remove text as well to force the authenticator app, as I've come to understand text is rather not secure, and the authenticator app seems to be generally regarded as a good method. Would this be done through the menu I mentioned in the first issue, the registration policy?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[External email tagging has been available in OWA, Outlook mobile, and Outlook for Mac since 2021. The most awaited support for "Outlook for Windows" is available now.
 In phishing attacks, attackers send emails pretending to be trusted persons or organizations. To prevent users from clicking malicious links and attachments sent by external users, admins can enable an external email warning tag in Outlook. It helps Outlook users handle those emails with extra attention. 
 Now admins can switch from the transport rule as it has few disadvantages,
  
It takes up a lot of space in the subject line, making it hard to preview the subject.
 As the transport rule might not be aware of the end user’s language, it leads to localization issues.
 Multiple external tags: If the external users keep replying to the thread, it will add multiple [External] tags in the subject.
 When you reply to the external email, they won't get any clue that you have enabled external tagging.
  
Admins can enable it through PowerShell. Start enabling external email tagging to alert users, irrespective of device usage.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Few days ago, we discussed the newly-released grant control that helps us to apply phishing-resistant MFA.
 https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/xxy1hl/apply_this_new_phishingresistant_mfa_setting_to/
 Today I observed that we can also add a custom authentication type by combining any type of multi-factor authentication.
 By default, Microsoft has categorized three authentication modes under grant control. They are, 
  
Basic multi-factor authentication. 
 Passwordless multi-factor authentication. 
 Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication. 
  
Now the cherry on top of this, we can also create a custom authentication type based on your requirement. You can combine any type of multi-factor authentication of your wish and apply it to your users. It can significantly help in disabling weaker authentication methods, such as SMS and calls.
 How do you think this custom authentication type can be used for your organization?

 We have two domains: CompanyA.local and CompanyB.local
 ​
 We have also a file server companyA.local
 ​
 The users from the domain CompanyB.local want to access the shared folders.
 ​
 ​
 also , how about file server permission procedure?
 ​
 This environment has two domains involved in a trust relationship. So both sides can authenticate to the other.

 https://fkeep.io/imgs/i/ptbR.jpg

 Basically, I want the vouchers to be usable up to X HOURS based on actual use and not when the voucher was activated (which forces the user to use it up all the moment it's activated).
 Say user one is issued an 8 hour voucher
 User can use it for a total of 8 hours worth meaning that the user can disconnect from portal when he's done browsing online for the moment, in order to have more time to browser online later.
 In the future, I would also need to generate some vouchers that will expire based on when it was first activated (used).
 But basically, I can't tell which is which.

 I like to use windows terminal, and I like it to default to wsl when opening. 
 But I'm using winget more and more, and so I also would like to have a different shortcut that will open windows terminal directly in power shell. To achieve so I've created a shortcut with parameters like so:
 "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_1.15.2524.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\wt.exe" -p "Windows PowerShell" 
 As you can see the path to windows terminal executable will change at every new update, breaking my shortcut. Taking the time to fix the shortcut every time is not worth the hassle.
 Do anyone knows how to create a dynamic shortcut that will handle the continuous change in the path? I was thinking something like this:
 "C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.WindowsTerminal_*\wt.exe" -p "Windows PowerShell" 
 But of course it will not work

I think that besides the basic SNMP theory, I will give some Net-SNMP examples first and then dig into an NMS.
 My instructor has given me two NMSs to choose from: Nagios core and Zenoss core.
 Which NMS would be better to use for creating lab exercises, which are intended to give a basic concept of network management. Should I even pick one or rather use both?
 I have Nagios Cookbook and Zenoss Core Network and system Administration as my source material for both NMSs.

 When I'm using an application fine have all the other services running, but when I close the app, close all your related processes.
 Anyone know of a tool do that type of clean up, I'm almost tempted to build one.

 IE: In the last month we had to patch every Exchange and every Fortigate for some bugs, mailing the client, but finding everyone required too much time.
 We also provide a monitoring software for the IT infrastructure but not everyone is willing to pay for that service so for everyone else, we got to check one by one or check manually every documents of the infrastructure we radct after the installation and configuration.
 What i'm looking for:Something that when a new infrastructure is installed i can... dunno, click some checkbox for every main system installed so if i need to know who have Exchange I'll have a list.
 A plus would be also something that can create or manage a mass mail for every group, I.E., got a problem with one thing, i can mass mail everyone who has that system.
 Do something like this exists? What do you do to keep everything organized?
 Thanks a lot!

 I have two routers: one for internet access, and other other is an LTE router for accessing a specialized service.
 There is no LAN infrastructure so am thinking of bridging the two wifis into one by making one behave like a switch.
 or turn one into a switch and connect it to the second router via lan cable. (with the process, i think i wont be able to access the services of both routers.
 Or i can get a third old router, turn it into a switch and connect the two routers to it. AM not sure if the 3rd rout/switch would be able to broadcast a wifi with the two wifis merged.
 Is it possible to do so or to do routing in a router/switch?
 ​
 its a thought experiment. Glad for any suggestions

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Friends, 
 Can you please help clarify following doubts?
  
In OSPF, While forwarding a received Type5 LSA to other area, why does the ABR not change the Advertising Router IP of the Type 5 LSA to it's own IP? What is te basic reason behind this? If ABR is able to change the Advertising Router's IP in the Type5 LSA, then there was no need of Type 4 LSA which meant less OSPF overhead on the network.
 BGP Split Horizon Rule says, "Don't advertise IBGP learned routes to another IBGP peer." The purpose is to avoide loop because as per standard, it is assumed that all of the IBGP Peers will be on full mesh connectivity. - What is the reason that the BGP Protocol designers made this standard assumption?
 Why is does the Route Reflector not change the next hop IP while advertising an IBGP learned route to client? I am trying to understand what made the BGP designers decide for RR to not change the next Hop IP for IBGP learned routes?
 What is the reason due to which BGP designers did not consider EBGP router to automatically change Next Hop IP for EBGP learned routes while advertising towards IBGP Peers?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all
 I'm hoping someone can shed some light before I go a little crazy.
 I know others have also had this problem as I've seen threads, but everyones is slightly different.
 2019 environment running RDS (With FSLogix) (Hosted in a DC)
 365 Apps for Enterprise - Shared License (E3)
 Back in May/June - all users received an activation issue - office wouldn't activate at all
 Microsoft pushed me around, placing registries keys like EnableADAL and DisableADALatopWAMOverride then it started to work but I didn't really want to use either of these keys long term... I was also advised to use: AlwaysUseMSOAuthForAutoDiscover=1 but I haven't removed this key as of yet.
 We continued to have problems for the months with Activation (not licensed) or 'these set of folders can't be opened'
 The main fix after a lot of research seemed to have been the Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin was missing/corrupted. I've been able to mostly fix this with a logon script that checks + reinstall with the following:
 if (-not (Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin)) { Add-AppxPackage -Register "$env:windir\SystemApps\Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin_cw5n1h2txyewy\Appxmanifest.xml" -DisableDevelopmentMode -ForceApplicationShutdown } Get-AppxPackage Microsoft.AAD.BrokerPlugin 
 For the most part, this script has fixed the daily problems but occasionally, for different people, randomly when they logon in the morning, they won't be able to open Outlook as it'll say 'these set of folders can't be opened' - AAD BrokerPlugin is installed and the main fix is to open Word, go to File > Accounts > Sign out and then sign straight back in. You can then open Outlook straight away - it's a frustrating little resolution.
 Has this else experienced this too? Anyone able to provide some insight or suggestions for a final fix?
 Thanks!

 We have a hybrid Exchange 2016 organisation. I finished migrating the last mailbox to exchange online. I have updated MX records and autodiscover (now pointing to EXO). We keep AD on prem.
 A the moment firewall port 25, 80 and 443 are still forwarded to our on prem mailserver. 
 The purpose of migrating to exchange online was to avoid the vulnerabilities of exchange on prem.
 So how can I disable OWA, and all unnecessary access from WAN to our exchange server?
 Do the ports still need to be forwarded? I read that some are necessary for AD connect?

 We're taking part in this years Gone Phishing Tournament and have gone through the setup process as instructed. The test email came through, bypassing the mail server filters and I uploaded a list of all users as instructed.
 This morning, I get an email from an end user saying they had received an email over the weekend about a "Gone Phishing Tournament". It appears they have been sent the same initial setup instructions that I received in September. A quick message trace shows that everyone in the company has received the same setup email! So now this tournament is no longer a surprise to anyone and has basically been ruined. 
 Has this happened to anyone else? I've contacted their support team and await their reply. I've looked back through the instructions and at no point does it say the uploaded user list will receive this email.

 Today I observed that we can also add a custom authentication type by combining any type of multi-factor authentication.
 By default, Microsoft has categorized three authentication modes under grant control. They are, 
  
Basic multi-factor authentication. 
 Passwordless multi-factor authentication. 
 Phishing-resistant multi-factor authentication. 
  
Now the cherry on top of this, we can also create a custom authentication type based on your requirement. You can combine any type of multi-factor authentication of your wish and apply it to your users. It can significantly help in disabling weaker authentication methods, such as SMS and calls.
 How do you think this custom authentication type can be used for your organization?

 Should I have one interface port on the Firewall appliance configured as a trunk for each of the logical networks setup as VLANs? Or would splitting wired and wireless device types into their own switches, each connected to a dedicated interface on the appliance be the better choice?
 What are the pros & cons, and which would give me better or worse performance? Is either approach sound?

To me they are just a solution thats not really expensive, but maybe not the ideal solution. 
 I have had a 3rd party in our stuff saying X is wrong or Y is wrong and so far its been things that are not actually a big deal. Example: They complained about the m.2 drives the NAS uses as not being enterprise. (The m.2 is simply a cache drive). They have also been looking at the network side of things and making, honestly dumb suggestions. Dumb as in replacing our backbone with a different manufacturer for network hardware.

 I have some questions I want to ask. The hosts are going to have 2x1G and 2x10G nics with the 10G being used for storage. 
 I'm trying to figure out what TOR switch I should use. I'm also trying to figure out if I should do all the routing on the TOR switch and even do the bgp sessions on said switch or should I just trunk the uplink to its own router and a firewall behind it. I have a xeon d host where I was planning on virtualizing most network functions.
 I'm probably not going to be able to afford any brand new high end switch so used switch recommendations are highly welcome.

 So Microsoft turned off Basic Authentication and I though I had everything under control. Sadly I missed our own Servicedesk :-D This is spiceworks on-premise.
 Does anybody know of a software that can work as an inbetween so it is possible to connect through Imap/Pop3 and the software can connect to Exchange via Modern Auth?
 Or should I just start looking for a new ticket system?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello All,
 Basically in one of our servers We got an alert about the CMOS battery
 I contacted IBM with the logs and they sent me a CMOS battery
 I managed to finally remove the old CMOS battery and insert this new one 
 However the CMOS battery bay holder is lose
 The CMOS battery bay in the server 
 ibm 3550 m5 
 Sits like this

 And the CMOS battery bay that seems lose has these plastic things as shown below
 https://i.postimg.cc/gkjv4p1r/Screenshot-2022-10-10-17-15-52-984-edit-com-miui-gallery.jpg
 that holds it ( it is NOT soldered to the board ) when I was trying to clip off the last battery I may have losened it
 Now when I plugged the new battery in the IBM server ImM console gives the same error saying something about a faulty battery so my questions are
 @ the server boots up and is functional without any noises and when the new CMOS battery was inserted it changed the IBM IMM time date to 1999 - does this mean anything ?
 @ also do I have to replace the whole motherboard or the CMOS battery being lose could it be a problem ? I mean it's placed fine - or could I tighten it from the back ? 
 @ does anyone know what the problem is ?
 Thanks !
