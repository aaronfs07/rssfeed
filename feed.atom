 I have a product called MonitUp.com.
 MonitUp measures the productivity of teams and freelancers with employee monitoring.
 Apart from employee monitoring, it also has features for IT teams to use, we also monitor computer hardware.
 We monitor the computer's RAM, CPU and HDD usage rates. We keep track of how much CPU and RAM all apps running in the background consume. At the same time, we instantly show the bandwidth used by the computer.
 What more features would you like to be interested in?

 We work with video surveillance system mainly network based video surveillance solutions. One of our very old client requested us to get their extremely poorly done network get somewhat managed.
 Couldn't really say no although we are already so so busy with other jobs. It is a 2 story building with multiple racks on each floors, we are required to identify each port and label them at both ends.
 Any idea how we can do this job in a speedy yet efficient manner?
 Don't really want my technicians to run around from one end to another manually taking out cables which could take forever given the fact each floor has somewhere in between 20+ lan points. 
 Any tips would be highly appreciated.
 Much thanks.

 ​
 I'm currently having the issue that sometimes when I try to logon to a server via remotedesktop the connection fails with "the logon attempt failed".
 Yesterday someone else had that issue, while I was able to connect to those servers.
 The problem doesn't always occur. It seemingly happens randomly and also fixes itself after some time passed like 1 to 2 hours.
 While the issue persists on one workstation from a different workstation you might be able to connect with the same login credentials at that time.
 ​
 It doesn't affect a single server and also happens with different operating systems of those servers (Windows Server 2008r2, Windows Server 2019) two of the currently affected servers are DC's. The affected DCs are Windows Server 2008r2 and the other 2 DCs that are not affected are Windows Server 2019. There are also other servers than DCs that are affected.
 - Trying to remote with the server IP adress didn't work directly but now it's working and the connection with the hostname still isn't working
 - The servername is beeing resolved correctly.
 - The affected servers are Pingable while the issue persists.
 - Last Windows Updates of those Servers were in October 
 Did anyone else have similar problems/knows what might be the issue here?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking for views on this and keep seeing conflicting points. Some say everything should be virtual, others suggest a physical DC.
 The issue we're trying to address is at present all our DCs are virtual - all our hypervisors are Hyper-V
 We recently did a full shutdown to carry out some electrical work. What we realized is that if the DCs didn't come backup automatically for whatever reason with the hypervisor then we wouldn't be able to authenticate with domain credentials onto the Hyper-V host.
 Alternatively I guess we could use local admin, but we use LAPs so again we need domain access to pull up the local admin password.
 As a bonus question - we have a Veeam backup solution which is also currently virtualised. Again my question is should this be physical? It's not using tapes, just backing up to separate SANs.
 If we couldn't get into our virtual environment, we wouldn't be able to do anything with our Veeam backups? We'd have to quickly build a Veeam server to access and restore our backups? Am i missing something

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Had an email through this am about a forced upgrade of all our MFPs from Konica Minolta (a brand which I think are pretty good) to Sharp and Lexmark.
 I was hoping others may be able to share their wisdom with these two brands, as I've never used them before and don't want us to be thrust into agreeing for a product that has well-known issues or quirks. 
 The specific models are 
  
Sharp BP70M75 (replacing a Konica Minolta Bizhub 654)
 Sharp MXB456W (replacing a Konica Minolta Bizhub 4020)
 Sharp BP50C26 (replacing a Konica Minolta C287)
 Lexmark C4342 (replacing a Konica Minolta C3100P)
  
The fact that we're having two brands replace one, doesn't sit well with me, but maybe this is standard practice. 
 I'd be interested to hear your thoughts, as I've always rated Konica Minolta highly (perhaps wrongly so??)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently studying computer science and came across the hint in an article that "definitive DNS data" is leaked during a DNS query and thus potentially information about the internal structure of the DNS querier could be found out if it is a web server on which an application is running. 
 Unfortunately, when googling for "definitive DNS data" I can only find standard articles describing the different DNS entries and nothing about the security relevant topic. For me this whole field around DNS a bit confusing and would be very grateful for some help or resources regarding this topic.
 I hope this is the right community for this question.
 Thanks in advance!

 Hypothetical question, but I am looking at ways to streamline the 'network' as a service in my organization. I have a lot of free time on my hands for the next few months :)
 I would like to ask this forum, what are some interesting initiatives that you have recently done that really made a difference? 
 Or similarily, what are some things that you would love to spend a few months to clean up?
 All suggestions appreciated!

 Ideally the routing would be local, as close to the source as possible. So if a host connected to DC2 wants to communicate with a host connected to DC2 on different VLANs, it would not be necessary for the traffic to travel to DC1 and back to be routed.
 Is this possible with MLAG? Do I need VRRP over MLAG? Or do I need EVPN-VXLAN?
 Thanks

 Scenario: 200 workers (mostly programmers), hybrid work, vpn.
 50% workers with client machines (win) 49% workers with office(domain) machines (win) 1% workers with office(domain) Linux
 Workers with client machines need access to internet and at least one local server
 The other workers like other company, some administration, programmers, etc and have his own servers and shared resources. this is what i am interested in isolating
 My first and only idea was try implement something wih packetfence and radius, for begin, create a VLAN for authenticate users and the isolate ass guest users with only internet use (no portal/no auth).
 The problem if activate 802.1x in the switchs , desk assignments are not fixed, and I did not get nor do I know if it is possible to validate an incorrect identification attempt as guest (user with client machine) or simple bypass users outside the domain and accept the radius query as a guest. Packetfence/Radius always block.
 Any ideas for the easiest way, dynamic, and without very specific and expensive software/hardware to implement some security?
 The switchs in this network even above they are bad (dlink), there is one that accept mac auth, the rest only 802.x / port based, they buy two years ago, and they are not about to change them

 And as I listened how very preventably and with constant complaints to managment somebody ended falling in boiling acid, I couldn't help but be thankful. I worked in a lot of poorly configured environments, poor security, poor performance, poor management... Who hasn't. And I have also fucked up a few times. Who hasn't. 
 But NOBODY IS GOING TO DIE if I don't convince management to fix a big issue, nobody is going to die if I fuck. Productivity will be lost, Data may be lost. You may get screamed at, you may be fired, your company may even go under. But nobody is going to be seriously injured. And I think that is worth keeping in mind when the pressure gets to you.

 I've heard of people recommending to back-up a drive as an image first before doing data recovery, but it seems they are usually referring to failing drives. Do I need to back up my external HDD as an image before running such data recovery if I'm just looking for deleted files and the drive is actually working fine?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm disputing some cost and pushing a service provider because they are not resourcing projects fast enough and work isn't getting done. They are still billing the same project management hours even when other hours have dropped. My monthly billing has become 25% project management because other resources are not working. 
 While I'm trying to get them to provide resources I also want to manage their non-value added expenses when people aren't working. I don't mind paying for meeting coordination and resource management when I see actual work and on really large projects I am not surprised by 5-10% but at this point, it feels like I am just paying them to send me the bill for the few hours I actually get and the e-mails apologizing that they don't have resources to do the job.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently got "promoted" at my company but actually got screwed over and left as the only IT person for a business unit that was sold. Was doing desktop support, junior administration tasks. However at once I was left in charge of everything, management, budgets, helpdesk, desktop support, server admin, network admin/engineer, network security, citrix, vmware, O365 admin, you name it. 
 I was only given a small raise but not what people that are responsible for this make. Worst thing is that it's not actually these advanced tasks killing me but the day to day helpdesk/desktop support. The company is fairly large for a one person plus on insane embarking of growing fast - so lots of changes, openings, purchases of small companies, onboardings non-stop. Management is abusive as well.
 People are quitting left and right this place. Think of what the media says of twitter, but not twitter. 
 in any case, they won't hire anyone else, in fact I can barely make purchases. 
 I've figured is a losing battle and is mentally breaking me. I've spent about past 2 or 3 months working 12 hour days, stressed, working weekends, have pulled about 3 all nighters and work 12 hours next day, no extra pay, etc.
 I was doing it because it was the chance of a lifetime for me to get out of "desktop support", but have only been able to get my feet wet in everything of the advanced items. So far I have been successful but the low wage along with the abuse and the work overload have made me decide I can't do it anymore.
 ​
 However I feel stuck, I don't want to go back to desktop support as that will lower my wage more, but I can't get a full system administration, network administration role as I'm no expert in these and I don't know what to do. Have been applying to jobs and have an interview next week, but any advice is appreciated, I'm truly in a desperate situation.

 Question of course is, can the gateway stay in place as 35.1 even though it's smack dab in the middle of the new subnet? I know it's an ugly sight, but technically speaking, will it cause any issues?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Everyone,
 Want to get your thoughts on datacenter switches, specifically between Aruba and Dell. Specifically I am looking at the Dell 4128 vs 6300M models.
 Dell is priced very well with 5 years support and prodeploy included. Everything looks great with them and all my servers and SANs are Dell. Some have said some negative things about Dell switches on this forum, weird CLI, difficult to work with, but those comments seem to be related more to OS9/Force10 and not OS10.
 On the other hand, all my access switches are Aruba and they have been flawless. Ive heard a lot of good things about Aruba and they were rated very well in the 2021 gartner report for wired and wireless LAN. Dell doesn't even seem to rank on this report. The Aruba quote is around 1.7x the price of the Dell quote. 
 I'm running Cisco currently. They aren't a contender because they absolutely blew the doors off with their price. I'm talking 5 times the others. I almost laughed at our MSP on the call. 
 Are any of you running Dell datacenter switches, specifically with OS10? Anyone running Aruba? How has it been for you?

 Please keep in mind I'm a complete novice to networking and excrutiatingly dumbed down explanations are very much welcomed.
 I see a global unicast address has the value 2000::/3 and I'm really struggling to understand how the slash notation correlates to the range of addresses it somehow represents.
 I don't think it helps because all the explanations I'm seeing speak of subnetting (which I'm familiar with in IPv4) but on the other hand I've got a CCNA instructor telling me subnetting doesn't exist within IPv6? 
 Help is very much appreciated as this is the first topic I've come across where I've really not been able to find the answer on my own. Thanks in advance.

 For more context, we have a Palo Alto, a cisco switch which we are configuring for a remote site.
 Compared to our other sites, this one is the only one with a PPPoE line and we'd like to somehow do a mock with a laptop and the equipment so hopefully and plug and play job for when we send the kit out.
 We plan to have one of our Palo interfaces be the primary port for this line and want to test in advance.

 NSLookup for Workstation B while on Workstation A is showing correct info. 
 Workstation A can RDP to other workstations and servers by name without issue. 
 Workstation A can RDP to Workstation B via IP
 Workstation C can RDP to Workstation B by name using same credentials that user on Workstation A is using. 
 Workstation A cannot RDP to Workstation B with other users credentials (that are successfully able to RDP from other workstations) when RDP via IP. 
  
Cleared RDP Connection History following this article. Cleared Windows Credential Manager stored passwords. 
 Not sure if anyone else has run into this recently.
 Edit: 
 Issue seemed to have fixed itself with just time it appears. I followed up with a client from a few days ago that was having this issue and tried connecting via workstation name and it worked. Just tried again with the Workstation A that I was troubleshooting this morning, and it worked again. No reboot was done on anything. As people have suggested it may be related to the Kerberos update.

I recently started dabbling in ansible and holy hell, it feels like I unlocked a cheat code. I can do things that would normally take me half hour+ to just as long as it takes to type the command out. My whole infra can be updated immediately, and I can make any change I want instantly to as many or as few servers as I want.
 I recently stood zabbix up, and I was able to get snmpd installed, configured, and the firewall ports opened opened on all dozen or so of my vm's by just typing out a playbook. I was so proud of myself when I checked the systems I ran it against and everything was exactly how I had specified in the playbook. I've still a lot to learn about ansible, but I really am kicking myself now for not looking at it sooner. I want to try and look into deploying new vm's with it next and work on automating a lot of tasks like updates, and get a better understanding of grouping devices.
 Learning linux has made me really loathe working with windows at my job, and I hope to one day make the jump to linux administration.

 I face a problem that even sophos didn't manage to resolve.
 We have 2 sophos firewall on the same lan. The 1st is used by user to connect with sslvpn. Some of our server have the 2nd firewall has gateway.
 The user who are connected on sslvpn cannot touch the server who have the other firewall has gateway.
 I realize some routing have to be done, but tbh i'm a bit lost.

 Everything, was working fine till these November updates. 
 I am using a DC with WS2012 R2 and after I installed the updates of November, domain users are taking a very long time to login or to log off on the domain PCs. Also, we can not access the shared drives. Sometimes it works when we access them trhough IP, but it does not work anymore with the server name. 
 I installed also the OOB, but no luck. Also I added this reg. but no success. 
 reg add "HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\services\kdc" /v ApplyDefaultDomainPolicy /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f 
 I will try to uninstall once again both the updates, but I do not have high hopes.
 Do you guys have an idea? what we can do to fix this?

 Best if free tool, can be selfhosted.

After a restart, or a unmap drive letter, map drive letter the file is gone. Sometime files are also looks corrupted, for instance a preview is shown, but I am unable to open it. When I try to copy the files to a new location it often shows errors for files I am able to open. 
 I desperatly need most (if not all) files on this hard drive (of course there is no fking backup, thanks to the prev sysadmin). Also the company won’t pay any money for a hard drive recovery service because some files are sensitive.
 My question is, would it solve my issues if I use a hard drive cloning device (will the files be corrupted even then?) , or shall I try some software like Acronis True Image? Please help me get these files back, my job depends on it.

 I was wondering if Parsec does split data when I merge two IPS DSL lines by using a load balancing router to get 100 down and 16 up for the faster upload.

 Other virtuals in a different domain on the same proxmox server work correctly.

 I presume any answer would apply equally to LR4 or copper connections.

We plan to put up some iPads with "Guided Access" (see https://support.apple.com/guide/ipad/guided-access-ipada16d1374/ipados) in branch locations and a webpage where visitors can give feedback. Network is achieved by a data SIM in the iPad.
 This is all working good, but now we are looking for a way to remotely unlock the devices, update it to the last iOS version and lock it again. 
 We looked at using an MDM like https://jumpcloud.com/ or a remote tool like TeamViewer, but so far we were not successful. There does not seem to be an option in jumpcloud to force an update and the remote tools could only view the screen but you could not interact let alone deactivate guided access and reactivate it. 
 Does anybody have a solution for this kind of problem?

 Current spend on 8 cloud servers per month is around £700 so looking to reduce that if possible.
 The idea is to reduce hosting cost and standardise to docker containers so developer and release process is easier.
 I have some Docker knowledge, but little Docker Swarm/K8s knowledge, I would rather not maintain the infrastructure if possible.
 I'm interested in a setup that would provide some redundancy/resilience for us - none of the servers have high traffic.
 I've looked at self hosted docker swarm, AWS ECS, Vultr, sloppy.io.
 Best solution I have in mind at the moment is to private rent a meaty server from Hetzner and setup docker on there, but this fails to give any redundancy in case that server fails.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello there, 
 I'm right now researching for a Project which I'm not able to Lab atm. thats why I'm asking here :).
 ​
 Customer came from a Sophos UTM which did Reverse Proxy and Default Gateway. Now he bought a Fortigate with a FortiWeb (Reverse Proxy / WAF)
 ​
 Now we think about the Network Design.
 I thought about the following:
 DNAT from Fortigate to FortiWeb(WAF) into the DMZ
 Then FortiWeb has Default Route on FortiGate which then routes traffic to the Webservers, which are all on a seperate VLAN. 
 ​
 Routing should work, but I have a feeling that SSL Offloading on the FortiWeb doesn't, since Session is being internally route and response comes back from different IP (Webserver). Can anyone confirm or entlighten me ?
 ​
 Thank you very much

 I am redesigning a technical interview for a windows role.
 So what I've done in the past is have someone use it locally on a laptop with vagrant and creating a Linux desktop for the testing area and also a Linux webserver that is broken for them to debug. Used no machine before as well. 
 Now, I am in a windows env and have azure to utilise. Does anyone know if I could use vagrant images reliably or if there is a best way to do this in Azure cli? I'm happy to learn powershell for this too.
 I want to be able to spin up the set up for consistency for each new candidate.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Just wanting to get some of your input about this, a client has asked me a job spec as I've recommended they hire a full time IT presence rather than fully relying on my MSP as there are too many gaps in the infrastructure that would be too expensive to sort via the MSP. 
 They currently don't have any IT staff so it would be a sole role with general support stuff, maintaining infrastructure, going ahead with minor upgrades, creating documentation and standardising some operations. With the MSP dealing with a lot of the larger upgrades, projects, patching, auditing and improvement recommendations.
 The infrastructure is quite small, manageable and not too complex but with a lot of room and time to learn and progress personally. I'm just wondering what job title you would expect to see this as? Part of me thinks it should be IT manager since they'll be the only onsite IT responsibility. On the other hand a lot of it will be dealt with by the MSP and the tasks required wouldn't require a seasoned manager as the MSP will be a fall back, so it seems like a good role for someone somewhat experienced to step up in terms of responsibility.
 Just wondering what your thoughts and points are? I don't want to recommend hiring a SysAdmin and them falling out of depth, being underpaid for the job and unhappy but on the contrary, I don't want to tell my client to overspend on someone who is overqualified and would get bored.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Disclaimer: this is a homework exercise
 I manage AS33 which has two uplinks to one provider (ISP A) and one uplink to another provider (ISP B). One of the traffic engineering tasks is to route inbound traffic to my prefix in priority via Router A connected to ISP A.
 It is trivial on Router B connected to ISP A by prepending the as-path. But here's the tricky bit the ISPs have a peer-to-peer connection thus the local preference is lower than their provider-customer routes to me (reference). The local prefence over my route is 90 to their peer 40. I did prepend the path here just to see if it works.
 As far as I understood weight and local preference are evaluated first and the as-path is not taken into account so how do I overcome this? Is there a way to only advertise my network 33.0.0.0/8 when the link to ISP A fails?
 We are using FRR v7.5

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdie all,
 it's all very new. Info is a bit scant. And as we are about to buy some more (if we actually have to). I'd be really grateful for some answers if anybody knows. Resellers sometimes don't know/understand everything correctly. Beeing able to fact check them is always a good idea.
 Our reseller is pretty solid, so I doubt they'll do the "get it wrong on purpose to sell more expensive packages"... 
 ​
 So starting October Windows Server can be licensed per virtual core. With a minimum of 8 virtual cores per VM.
 Question 1:
 When they say virtual cores do they really mean virtual "cores" or do they mean virtual threads. Basically can I have a vm with 16 threads assigned and only use a 8 core licenses?
 With physical cores it was actual cores. So our 2x16C server has 32 Cores and we needed 32 core licenses. But could use 64 threads as they are all multithreaded.
 ​
 Question 2:
 Are existing physical core licenses we have now automaticall virtual core licenses as well?
 We have 32 Core licenses. Which allowed us to run 2 windows servers maximum. If they are now virtual core licenses as well. We could theoretically run 4 windows servers with 8 cores each.
 ​
 Question 3:
 All client/device CALs need to be either subscription or with SA. is another prereq from what I gathered.
 Is that referring to windows server CALs only. Or exchange CALs as well. What about RDP CALs?
 Our windows server and exchange CALs have SA so we are good with those. But our RDP CALs do not. Will that preclude us from using these new virtual core licenses for an RDP server?
 ​
 any feedback most appreciated

 I'm looking for an alternative to Microsoft Sharepoint as the more I use it, the more I hate it. It's really bad.
 So I'm looking for a paid alternative with multi-language support. Our Intranet pretty much exists of a website with a menu that leads to different categories and pages, a site content database and a good looking homepage.
 The most important thing is the homepage since our employees see it first. In sharepoint, we have a cascade of 5 visual items of the latest news, under that the most important events in the upcoming week(s) and under that some handy links that they can click on.
 So looking for something similar to that, but it doesn't necessarily need to be an interactive workspace where employees can share files, work together, etc. A simple, but functional and good looking Intranet website would do. And yeah, it needs to be multilingual. Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning from the wet, windy, wild UK, fellow Sysadmin's. 
 In creating my YT / LinkedIn content for the M365 world and seeking new solutions to problems, I came across a really handy PowerShell module I'd like to share with you: IntuneBackupAndRestore. 
 Find it on Github here: https://github.com/jseerden/IntuneBackupAndRestore
 It's a module which is written specifically to backup your Intune instance; policies, script contents, settings catalogs, admin templates.. It seems pretty full featured. It hasn't been maintained for over a year, and I haven't yet tested a restore.. But essentially the tool:
 1) Connects to your tenant
 2) Exports all the config into JSON
 3) Organises that into folders
 4) Puts it on any storage you can access
 I've tested the backup in my (very small) tenant, and it seems to work really, really well. 
 There's full documentation for the module in the repo for further reading, just wanted to make people aware of it's existence.
 Remember; MS don't back any of this stuff up. If you made a mistake or some disgruntled, over privileged monkey trashes your environment the day they leave, they won't help you. Unlikely? Yes. Impossible? No. 
 Personally, I'm going to setup some Azure storage and then automate the script to run once a week and export everything there. 
 Hope someone finds this useful. Happy hump day!

 I have disabled user to have permissions to regedit so i need to run it as Admin but to apply the regs on current logged user.?
 My attemp was bellow, but it's just not working.
 $username = ((Get-WMIObject -ClassName Win32_ComputerSystem).Username).Split('\')[1]
 $password = 'S3CR3T'
 $securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $password -AsPlainText -Force
 $credential = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential $username, $securePassword
 Start-Process -filepath "$env:windir\regedit.exe" -Credential $credential -Argumentlist @("/s", "\"\domaincontroller\Regs\T.reg`"")`
 ​
 To point out this is becouse iam lazy and i dont want to convert every reg-file update ( for win11 ) manualy , the idea is to just import it via script and redownload new reg file from source.Simple clean, otherwise i need to manualy go download convert it to XML and import it in GPO.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So in my business I use to use App Password Generation in Gmail to create a client email for backup notifications from my clients backup software to myself and/or to the client. A while ago Gmail locked down their services so you can no longer use that feature labeling it a "security update" when they removed it. I moved over to yahoo and it was working up until about 4-6 months ago. They are doing the samething now but lying about it saying feature is disabled for "a redesign" but its been disable for like 4-6 months now...
 Basically I'm looking for a free email provider that allow 3rd party app usage. If that requires app password generation thats fine but it needs to be a free feature included with basic free mail.
 Anyone recommend any free email host providers that will allow this function? Obviously ones that are not gmail or yahoo.
 At one point I was looking into proton mail but I forgot why that wasn't going to work. I think there was an email sent limit or something that turned me off from using it.

The client can ping every device in the source list defined in phase 2 however i can only hit the most recent device the client ping me from in his range.
 For example if the client pings my PC from .8 i can then ping .8 as much as i want, but if the client then pings me from .7 i can ping .7 but i can no longer ping .8.
 The client has to initiate traffic for phase 2 to come back up if i taken the tunnel down. We've exhausted more than one Fortinet support tech on this, anyone ever encountered this before?

 I guess my question is, how effective is studying to actually land a role with 0 experience. And I don't mean studying items that one has hands on access to, definitely good to lay good foundations one has access to, but actually studying things that one has no access to other than labs, etc.
 Are certifications for people that are in the role to prove their knowledge with a brief refresh? or do they help at all in landing a better job with no prior experience in that field where certified.

The stacks all have full ring redundancy. As part of my testing I’ve been running various failure scenarios and in the event the stack master goes offline it is bringing down the entire stack. All ports on the other switches go offline for over a minute. The standby becomes the new master but it seems like the stack election is taking a long time. This should be close to instant shouldn’t it? Is there some configuration I’m missing for this to be faster or is that the expected behaviour?

 TLDR; stagger your server power on times to prevent power surges. 
 RFO:
 On November 23, 2022 at 02:41 GMT, CenturyLink identified a service impact in Orlando, FL. Operations Center (NOC) was engaged to isolate and investigate the cause of the outage. Initial analysis showed that a power failure in the Orlando area was the cause of the outage. The local power company repaired the commercial power but when all systems in the office tried to restore at once, the power surge tripped the main power breakers. Field Operations were onsite and reset the breakers to restore service at 03:36 GMT on November 23, 2022. The NOC will continue to monitor the alarms to ensure stability has been achieved.

I ran a backup using TFTP and watched on my TFTP server as the file loaded in, verified it was there, and then looked back at ISE which had an error stating "Copy to repository Failed". I'll most likely run another backup using FTP instead as the failure has me a bit nervous that the files may be incomplete or corrupt. Has anyone else seen this behavior before? If so did you happen to test these backups? The file sizes match previous backup file sizes and my TFTP server had no errors in it's logs to show.

At location B, I have a SonicWALL configured with the network 10.30.19.x, with the SonicWALL serving as the DHCP server. The SonicWALL has a VPN to the datacenter. Clients are connected via Meraki switches and APs in bridged mode. Some clients at location B are receiving 10.30.11.x addresses from the DHCP server at location C, which also has a VPN connection to the data center. Is there a way to block DHCP requests from traversing the VPN? If not, how can I force location B clients to only use the local SonicWALL for DHCP? I appreciate any advice, as I don't want to break a production environment if at all possible! Happy Thanksgiving.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies if this is kind of a noob question but I'm wanting to setup a way to automate as much of the process as I can for new Windows 10 installs on desktops for end users. I'm wanting to achieve the below:
  
Run Windows 10 setup (unattended)
 
Boot into Windows and run Windows Updates, download drivers (Detect if GPU Intel/NVIDIA/AMD and download most up-to-date driver), run DISM/SFC/CHKDSK/Defender and reboot
 
Run updates again then reboot (at least x2)
 
Run Prime95 for 15 mins and write results to log file
 
Run memtest
 
Update BIOS
 
 ​
 Would a PXE server be the best way to go about the Windows 10 install itself, and can this be configured to run in unattended mode? I've created a batch file which will run DISM, SFC scan, schedule a CHKDSK for the next reboot, run a Windows Defender quick scan, run Windows updates and schedule a reboot for 30 minutes but I'm assuming there are better ways of doing this, especially since I'd need to manually copy this file across once the initial install has been completed and execute it manually. Any advice is appreciated!

I have messed with lmhosts etc. to try to fix this and have had no luck. there is a lot of scripts using similar authentications and I really don't want to update everything, would rather figure out why it suddenly stopped working after years of working fine. has anyone ran into this or something similar with the recent security hardening?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all! I need help with this configuration/advised with a routing S2S question(s).
 We opened a new branch office and a S2S VPN tunnel is up between both Palo Alto firewall between branch office to HQ office. My question is, the layer 3 Cisco switch at the branch office using static IP addresses, what would be the next hop so that the branch office knows how to communicate with other IP networks at HQ? 
 I can ping the main physical interface 1(native) network 10.8.10.0/24 from the branch office to HQ, but cannot ping another sub-interface networks that live in HQ. 
 So far, this is the current IP static routes on the branch office layer 3 Cisco switch:
 Ip route 0.0.0.0/0 10.8.30.1 <- PA eth 1 gateway interfac Ip route 10.8.1.0/24 <- what would be the next hop for 10.8.30.0 network to communicate with other networks at HQ? 
 Ip route 10.8.0.0/24 <- what would be the next hop for 10.8.30.0 network to communicate with other networks at HQ? 
 I can ping from the Branch office to HQ subnet 10.8.10.0 which is the network on the physical interface at HQ but I can’t ping other networks as sub-interface. Is this a routing issue?

I'm just comfortable with having to rapidly gather, digest, communicate, and prioritize significant amounts of information to/from multiple people explicitly because in Eve, I would have 60-300 people in a group with me needing similar communications for our internet space battles to go well. The group I was part of even had us do after action reports (AAR), and I swear its 1:1 what I have to do at my job. IDK how I would have been able to build this skillset in "the real world" with a similar level of non-consequence for failure. 
 If you are considering going into IT leadership/management, or just like terribly complicated grindy spaceship games full of massive try hard garbage, you should totally give leading fleets in Eve Online a try :P

 I searched the internet for articles about how to choose the right transceivers. I know that two transceivers will work together if they have the same wavelength and fiber type (MM or SM). All those articles talked about SFPs. They didn't mention their compatibility with GBICs.
 So my question is can SFP work together with GBIC if they share the same specifications (wavelength and fiber type)? Must they be with the same speed or can I buy 10gig SFP and connect it to 1gig GBIC?
 Thank you!

 1: Management (I know, I know – this needs to change)
 2: Corporate
 333: Guest 1
 666: Guest 2
 999: Unifi Management
 1000: Default VLAN
 I am working on running fiber home runs but in the meantime, many of these switches are daisy chained. So for example, floor 1 switch would have the router coming into port 1 and port 2 would go to floor 2 switch port 1. Port 2 from this switch would go to floor 3 switch port 1 and so on. These ports all use vlan 1 as their “primary” vlan (in the Brocade config it says “dual-mode 1” for these ports). T…]]></summary>

 I've been tasked with creating a hidden SSID for a small group of devices. These devices should ONLY be able to communicate with themselves in their respective subnet, i.e no access to other subnets or WAN. This SSID will need to be implemented in all 8 of our locations and the devices will travel to different locations. 
 We have a 2 tier architecture, so each location's distribution layer also handles the routing up to our main office. Our use of VLANS is minimal, we have 3 for VoIP, Data, and Management. Our wireless AP's are Ruckus. Our wireless LAN is using the "Management" vlan, or vlan 30 (Interface on SonicWall). This LAN is also what connects our switches to the SonicWall. 
 I'm trying to think of the best way to implement this, but I worry I may be overthinking it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, as the title reads, in an update from a while back I updated to some stable build (I don't remember which one) of Windows 11. I then noticed that my task scheduler script wasn't working, I checked whether everything was set up correctly, but then I looked at the Event Viewer, and EventID 4688 for process creation events was nowhere to be found. I then went through the documentation which (at the time) didn't say anything about Windows 11 and then contacted Microsoft, got elevated, and the support told me the feature was no longer supported.
 Now, luckily I only use this event for triggering a launch script, which is relatively easy to do manually through a shortcut, but this is still pretty annoying.
 Other sysadmins use this event for more important stuff, like monitoring the usage of their devices for many different types of purposes.If you want to vote on this feature to return, upvote this post in the Feedback Hub.
 Edit: The story gets, weirder, a recent insider build said it fixed this issue, while support and the technical writers have said that the feature isn't supported. Something really strange must be happening in Redmond...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So. I’ve managed to entrench myself at a small media company as their “tech support/IT/networking/anything nerdy” guy. Problem is a severe lack of understanding and appreciation about the entire field of IT and system support and I’m getting pretty “over it”. It’s a cobbled together network with no servers so nothing more than a UniFi router and switches and some APs, and most of my time is spent just doing tier 1 help desk crap and attempting to make some sort of sense of data management for a video production company that uses 30-60tb a quarter and wants all of it accessible at any time and doesn’t want to delete anything and also doesn’t understand why a production RAID isn’t a backup. 
 I’ve digressed a bit because my ACTUAL question is: even as a very quick learner and problem solver, am I just dead in the water being so out of the loop on industry standard systems and practices? Once upon a time I was a student admin for the defense department in the late 90’s early 00’s so I’m very in the loop in a general way and have plenty of hoop-jumping experience having worked for DOD and dealt with about every major red tape hurdle you could think of for IT and dev teams given the GsA phonebooks of rules and restrictions, BUT I just get dejected looking at current posting when they list about 5-10 different things I’ve never dealt with in my life because there hasnt been a need in my current career path. So I guess what I’m asking is, am I just super behind and if so, is there a resource anyone could recommend for “learning what it is I need to learn about” if that makes sense? I am fully capable of learning a new skill or system very rapidly but I just don’t know where to begin after being left “unsupervised” for this long. Thanks all and be gentle, I’m an old nerd stepping out of a cave for the first time in a decade.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Need someone's brain I need to pick. I have a classic router on a stick. I'm doing a redesign of core and distribution layer. Would it be best-practice to enable portfast trunk on all interswitch links (core to distribution and distribution to access) to allow for fast reconvergence of my spanning tree? Or is this not recommended? 
 Had an issue today upon enabling a new link on my old core that caused a reconvergence and caused some clusters to lose their connection to their quorum ( thanks SAP); and I want to prevent this in the future.
 EDIT: for anyone finding this post in the future. Portfast trunk should only be enabled on ports linking to ehter a router/firewall or a device containing a virtual switch (Most Hypervisors; eg VMware). For edge devices, use portfast together with bpduguard.

 Trying to do a post-mortem on a weird situation I had yesterday. It seemed that one of our IPSEC VPN LAN-LAN connections was knocking out 2 -3 of our other LAN-LAN VPNs. Not finding anything in the logs besides "IPsec connection was disconnected passively. " There was some network troubleshooting being done at on of the other sites with a VPN, but theirs was not having any issues it seems.
 Tried all the basic troubleshooting/power cycling, rebuilt the VPN connections on each router. All the sudden towards end of day, started working normally. 
 I'm a sysadmin/jack of all trades/helpdesk position. Boss has more networking knowledge, but is out all week. My plan is to have the router in question replaced tomorrow, but wondering if anyone has any ideas, or tips how to get to the bottom of what was happening and if I really need to replace this router in question. It's been stable for about 18 hours.

One problem I am dealing with right now is they are trying to populate the department attribute with both tier 1 and tier 2 departments. Think of it like department and team. Problem is, they are constantly exceeding the 64 character limit since hospital department and team names tend to be a bit verbose. I have tried copious abbreviations but then it looks like code that no one has the deciphering key to. Anyone else who has run into this, how to do manage this? I was thinking of using two separate attributes but if I use something like any of the extensionattributes, obvious these would not be very easily seen by end users. Suggestions?

 I have a Macbook in Apple Business Manager (that synced to Jamf Now). I reset the macbook and turned it off then released it from Apple Business Mnager & Jamf Now. However a few days later trying to start it up and go through new setup its still connected to my organisation, click continue and it just says failed to get MDM.
 So 2 questions:
 1) Did I release it correctly, I think I did (similar process to Intune devices.
 2) How can I reset it from this state?

I follows the instructions listed here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-server/networking/dns-zones-do-not-load-event-4000-4007
 and since this DC with the issue was the PDC I reset using itself as the target and that worked. server rebooted and i can open my dns again. However now i'm noticing the other DC's listing ":error" when looking at operations master in AD, and i can see this error on my PDC role DC that had the dns issue. 
 "Unable to verify the convergence of this machine account. does the machine account need resetting?" I see other people have used netdom to fix this, but i just did reset the machine password as per the Microsoft article so i'm confused if i need to reset it again, and if so with what syntax? or do i need to rest the other DC's? 
 Hopefully someone can explain this a bit better to me. Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow sysadmins, I'm having a tough time figuring this one out, or I may just be running in circles. Does Remote Desktop Gateway only support NTLM authentication or is there a way to get it to use Kerberos? No matter what I've tried it always authenticates with NTLM to the Gateway, whether I am on premise or at home using KDCProxy. I've scoured every post on the net I can find but there's no straight answer on this. I've tried the flags rdgiskdcproxy:i:1 (my KDCProxy is my Gateway) and that didn't work. I am running NLA but I don't want to turn that off as that offers protection. I'm aware that NTLM is the protocol that will never die at this point, but if there is a way to implement Kerberos I would love some assistance. Thank you all very much in advance for any help or advice you might have. Gateway is running Windows Server 2022 Datacenter.

When I complain, I usually get the reply: "just make sure everything is working perfectly in the environment, and my code will work fine" . Just because your code thinks a "server" is unavailable doesnt mean it actually is. Got one right now. on a server restart it complains that the authentication server is unavailable. Im assuming it means the mssql server that it uses(which is up), and ill base my troubleshooting on that, but i could be wrong. PMs this is why troubleshooting custom applications takes so long!

 As far as for anyone else, after all the print nightmare fiasco and new server patches - printers stopped mapping for new PCs or if different print driver is in use. GPO result reports errors and you can only install manually by providing admin creds. (all known stuff)
 I've decided that's fine, I will just do it manually when needed -- whatever. Maybe MS will fix this. Nope. I think it's time to do something else.
 I know that some sysadmins are deploying printers locally to computers by using IP addresses. I'm unfortunately not very fond of this idea as you lose centralized spooler for that printer. Also way less painful if there is network change…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm quite new to networking and using servers in general and I'm experiencing a weird issue that's only just started to occur that I can't really find a solution for with google.
 I have a home media server connected to my network running Xubuntu with a static IP address (192.168.0.69) that I use at home to connect to for storing data, listening to music, programming and occasionally other things.
 Recently, I've been waking up to find that I can no longer connect to this device via my network.
 If I ping 192.168.0.69 from any device I own I recieve the following response:
 Pinging 192.168.0.69 with 32 bytes of data: Reply from 192.168.0.41: Destination host unreachable. Reply from 192.168.0.41: Destination host unreachable. Reply from 192.168.0.41: Destination host unreachable. Reply from 192.168.0.41: Destination host unreachable. 
 This problem, however, can immediately be resolved by going downstairs into the room where my router and server co-exist, and simply pressing the power button on said server, waiting until it switches off, then pressing the power button again.
 As soon as I do that, everything returns to normal and everything is up and connected for about 2-3 days until I inevitably wake up the next morning to find everything disconnected again.
 This has only just started to happen, it's been fine up until now.
 Any help is appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Let me start this by saying this whole situation is utter hell, but it's a necessity.
 I have a server that came from a company we acquired. On this server, let's call it HV1, we have a HyperV installation with 2 DC's, an APP/RDS Server and a DB server (MS Access), and all of these servers are on Server 2012 R2. This host is sitting cold on the network and will never touch the wider internet. On the APP/RDS server is a proprietary software that was developed by the former company over the course of 15 years and there's no documentation. It talks to MS Access files on the DB server and there is a mapped drive to these files on the APP/RDS server. The software is loaded from the APP/RDS server and seems to be very tied into the domain with domain authentication and will not boot unless one of the two DCs is powered on. If the DCs are off, I get some SQL network errors saying the system cannot contact a DC to service the auth request. Boot them on, the software loads and asks for credentials.
 I now need to repurpose this G9 server and use it for production, which means I need to migrate this setup away from this host and onto an older server which can continue sitting cold for X time. Essentially, replicating the entire setup from one server to another, and the only difference being that I'll be moving it to VMware instead of using HyperV. Instant concern when I was asked for this was the domain controllers.
 I've done the initial backup & restore using Veeam, and I now have all of the servers sat on my new host. The problem of course is the domain and DCs - They aren't functional/working and that domain essentially is non-existent at the moment.
 Before I go any further, I want to have a think about the potential best ways to bring these DCs back to life, purely for the purpose of getting this application working again.
 Thoughts?
 Cheers!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unfortunately we're still very much learning how to use Endpoint Management with Azure, as the main business is still on prem. However, the "side business" uses exclusively Azure
 We don't have auto enrolment available to use, and are relying on users logging in on the new laptop. The problem then is that the user becomes local admin, which is bad. The solution to this has been to create an entry in user account protection that sets the only admins as "administrator" (local admin) and a special pcadmin account we created on Azure AD. To my understanding, this is fine
 The issue we have though, is if we need to support a user remotely, we can't elevate privileges in Bomgar (BeyondTrust) using the Azure account, it only seems to support local user accounts. This hasn't been a problem as we were with the users logging into their laptops, so we could set the admin password at the machine, but the case has arisen where I need to do something on a laptop which was bought and remains in another country
 I was hoping I could, as a temporary workaround, add a PS script to enable and set the local admin password, but either it's not working or the laptop just won't sync, because it's not made a difference
 Is there a solution to my problem, or do I need to take a few steps back and make some bigger changes to our system (other than auto-enrolment)
 ​
 Bonus question - my employer will pay for training courses. Is there a recommended one I can go on for Enpoint Manager/Intune? I've seen the Azure course, but I fear that doesn't really cover the device management I need to learn

 We've introduced a new ERP back in August. We've got Vmware Horizon VDIs (4 cores, 8GB RAM, Win Server 2016) and the employees use MS Edge to access the ERP. Everything worked great until now, now some of them are having major performance issues when scrolling/clicking through the webclient. It doesn't crash, but the entire browser becomes unresponsive for 8-10 seconds. Same result with Chrome and Firefox. The majority has Teams, Outlook, a few Excel sheets, a few Chrome tabs and MS Edge open, which uses around 30% CPU and 60% RAM altogether.
 I tested it on the local thinclient browser and it runs fine there, so the problem only seems to persists on the VDIs.

 Now, I was expecting at least some sort of minimal central management, but sadly no. It's just spreadsheets, as far as the eye can see, each "designed" by someone different and with varying levels of techno-fluff.
 So, my first job is to sort those spreadsheets into something manageable. I've no experience managing this much equipment and objects, so no idea where to start - my background is developer/opportunistic devops/dogs body, so it's not like it's particularly daunting for me.
 For what it's worth, Zabbix is installed and actually appears to up to date and useful, so it's not so much monitoring that I'm looking for as it is management.

 Printer/copier/fax: Canon imageRUNNER 1730i
 Is there a way, for documents that are forwarded from the fax machine, to show sender info in the body of the email?
 ​
 Curently fax's are fowarded from [copier@ourcompany.com](mailto:copier@ourcompany.com) and sent to all staff emails. These emails have a basic subject line which I can edit "our company ltd" and have an attached pdf of what was sent through. The naming of the pdf is randomly generated and no sender info is available in the body of the email.
 Currently faxs are not printed, only forwarder to all of the team.
 It is very difficult to find older fax emails as there is no way to search by specific sender email or phone. (I think they are all coming in via fax # but have no way to confirm.
 I feel there is a check box somewhere in admin settings I am missing or not understanding that could apply sender info to fwd'd email somehow.
 Any help appreciated!
 Cheers,
 Cheap

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Can anyone suggest why an MSI unattended installation (using msiexec /i) would work when the installer files are copied locally, but not when they're on a network drive?
  
The installer uses files external to the MSI.
 The MSI contains a copy of 7z.exe which it extracts to a folder under %TEMP% and uses to extract the external files (they are .wxi.7z files in an Installer.Components folder).
 I've already tried setting the FilterAdministratorToken registry setting in case it was to do with that, but that had no effect.
 The MSI was made using the WIX installer toolset.
 I tried doing caspol.exe -q -machine -addgroup 1 -url file://Z:/* FullTrust -name "Z Drive" as WIX is apparently a .NET application and may need extra permissions to be able to access network drives, but this did not fix the issue.
 I tried doing a Process Monitor capture to see if I could identify what was wrong, but nothing popped out at me.
 The installer log file contains the errors "Error. Failed to attach console to process. Error Code: 5. Error. 7z.exe returned exit code: 0"
  
Because the install files are large (total is around 24GB), I don't want to have to copy them locally onto machines I need to deploy this app on.

 What I'd like is something that's still a small, rechargeable device, but that offers enterprise niceties such as:
  
Dual SIM (Not essential, but it can help in some edge cases)
 Management portal with signal and usage metrics and connection logs.
 Simple L3 controls. (At least so I can force users to connect to our full-tunnel VPN)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 My colleague who does not work on this project anymore, created the CA infra on my domain. For some testing purposes he created multiple certs for both the root and the intermediate servers. 
 I would like to sanitize this config, so only the current and valid cert is visible. 
 On Certificate Authority app I right click the server at the top of the tree, Properties, and on the General tab there are 2 CA certificates for my intermediate server. I revoked (from the root) the one which I don't need, published the CRL, deleted this cert (backed up previously) from the intermediate server itself (cert store), but on this list it is still visible.
 Is there a way to delete from this list? Or is that enough what I have done?
 Thank you!

 I have a migration of a server containing all the backup copies of our VMs via a hardware RAID, and I am looking for information on the feasibility of the trick.
 Currently I have an HP DLXXX G8 with 12 SATA LFF, and I have a DLXXX G9, with the correct slots, and a P840 which is fine.
 My seller more or less told me this: "Normally, you move the disks, and the RAID is automatically recognized, and it starts again", I find it hard to believe that it will go so well, however, I do not have the technical possibility of moving all the content to another storage (no space available, no financial means to buy 12 LFF of 8 TB , we are a very small company). 
 Have you ever had the experience, it goes well in general? Thanks in advance :D

 Is it good idea to put all DB servers in one VLAN, A by All App server in other VLAN ? In this case, if a function has one DB server and VLAN is assigned with /24 then its a waste of addresses.
 or
 Do you separate each DB and App servers by function?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi r/networking
 Looking for some feedback on something. We have had a dev come to us - asking for access to pcap driver for sniffing traffic to locate certain devices.
 My initial reaction to this was a hard no - as I was always taught this was a very bad thing to do. With the risk of intercepting unencrypted data such as passwords etc.
 In today's world - would you consider this as much of a risk? My personal thoughts are:
  
L2 boundaries (such as VLAN with SVI) will limit what can be easily sniffed.
 plaintext data is a risk no matter what (should be wrapped or encryption).
 purely talking about sniffing of packets, not any other related attacks, the risks are minimal if everything is encrypted?
  
edit: I should mention my recommendation was for scanning the ip-ranges instead (as this would also allow for situations where devices are in another l3 network). You could pre-populate with the ip range of the adapter used for the scan.

 I’d love to get some advice from the community and get some pointers on where I can take my career. I’ve worked at a MSP for about 2 years and for the last 5 years I’ve worked for school district where I’m the lone systems and network administrator. I’m fully in charge of maintaining and upgrading about 100 switches and 400 access points, mix of Meraki and Cisco across 11 sites. About 5000 users in total. For the network end I’ve implemented and swapped out access layer switches, implemented a basic single area OSPF, setup vlans/port security/BYOD network/etc., maintain a wireless network and troubleshoot various problems that come up. 
 As for the systems side of it. I’m also in charge of managing and upgrading servers. I’ve done multiple domain controller upgrades, file server migrations, NPS servers, DHCP, Print, Hyper-V upgrades/deployments, Image creation from Windows 7 to Windows 11. 
 I’ve also been point person on several projects, some with outside vendor and some internal. 
 My question to the community is, I feel I have a very good picture of IT from a big picture but I would love to become a more advanced network engineer and climb up the salary rank. Where can I take my next step to really speed up the learning process? I’ve done MSP work before but feel they always get bogged down with lower tier busy work and are very cookie cutter from my experience. 
 I’ve got my degree and in the midst of attaining my CCNP. Any advice? Any recommended industries?

I had seen the occasional iPhone have an IP DHCP learning failure and not really causing huge concerns nobody was really yelling about it but was getting a little concerned as we move close to doing a mass deployment of a major building. It turns out from looking through some forums and then my own config I hadn't actually had the DHCP helper addresses on the SVI in question on the controller.
 Here's my problem, I don't know how any of the devices were getting thcp if there was no relay address configured. The only thing I can think is in the WLAN config I did have the IP of the DHCP server entered, but that's different than the helper address. So I'm a bit stumped as to why it ever worked, also why iOS seems to be the only operating system that felt any impact.

 We have a fleet of identical hardware with identical SOE yet the odd machine will die on users, apparently. I'd really like to thoroughly test the machines before handing to staff.
 I can run memtest, I can run prime95 but is there anything bootable? Even some kind of intense linux benchmarking suite would be fine? I just want to 'fire and forget' - come back to a machine 8 hours later and see if it passed or not.

 It would be real nice to store it on our coffee repository rather than a 60gb image.
 This can be annoying at times and it would be much more efficient to store a cloud-init/dockerfile/packer style that I could run and it would build the os for me.
 Is this possible?
 How can I do this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[hello all,
 ​
 At my current employer, the engineer before me configured each switch weird. On the switches; the first 24 ports are for the Data Vlan and the next 24 ports are for the Voice Vlan. The issue is computers and IP phones are connected to random ports - which then makes a lot of computers and IP phones on the wrong vlan.
 ​
 What is an easy way of cleaning this up? Only way I can think of is going to each port and assigning the correct vlan. Is this the correct way to do it?
 ​
 Thanks in advance

We simply used the Schannel registry method to disable strong mapping, but we'd like to fix the issue properly. The doc below from Microsoft leaves a lot to be desired in terms of what to do with AD CS and existing cert templates. 
 It sounds like using an additional field in the Alternative Subject Name might do the trick, but should I enable that on the existing certificate template and wait for clients to auto renew, or issue a new one? Issuing a new one seems wise so it can be dished out in stages for testing, but it's unclear if the correct cert will be chosen if two exist in the user's personal store. 
 Do we also need to issue new certs for the actual NPS server?

 In my short time here, we've received several types of tickets asking for "the PC sitting over in Karen's old desk area" to be reimaged or "Frank left the company a few months ago, I have his laptop in my lower desk drawer. Can someone go grab it and image it up ASAP? His replacement starts Monday and he's going out to a customer site Monday afternoon."
 I mentioned to my boss this seems out of the ordinary and he insisted it's always been this way and he'd rather have the end user's departments responsible for managing their inventory than it falling onto us. Consequently, there are HPs, Dells, Lenovo, Microsoft and Asus desktop & laptops out there due to departments making the decision on what they want to purchase.
 Is there anyone else out there in a similar situation? If so, how do you make it work? My gut reaction is to push for this to be changed, but I'm so new and not sure if I want to rock the boat quite yet.

 Years ago, i would open a support request, get a response in 6-24 hours, work with a 1st tier support, get escalated once or twice, then work with someone that really knew the product, or watch as the person i was working with gave KVM control to some mythical support tier person that would identify an issue and return a fix. It could be AD, Exchange, windows server, etc. It was slow, but as long as your persisted, you would eventually get to someone that could fix your issue.
 In the last few years though, something has changed. I get passed between queues. I get told to make changes that take services offline. Simple things like "the cloud shell button works everywhere but in the exchange admin web console" gets passed around until i get an obviously thoughtless response of i ..."need to have a subscription to Exchange to use the cloud shell."
 This extended beyond cloud services. I've had a number of tickets for other microsoft products that get no where. I've received calls from support personnel angry that i would agree to close a ticket that has not been fixed. I get someone calling me at 4am to work on a low-priority issue that ive' requested email communication.

Then that leaves what to do with the other 50 PST's from former employees that are sitting there not being accessed?
 Option A: Move to Sharepoint with the rest of File Server Contents. 
 Option B: Move to shared 365 mailboxes.
 Option C: What PST's? I never seen them. 
 Option D: Portable Hard Drive :/
 Update: From the responses it seems clear the best path is B which I was already leaning heavily towards.

 One of our sites is having an issue where external calls are occasionally getting static. It doesn't happen every time nor with every phone, but they get it consistently enough that it seems to be on our end. Looking at some of the calls they have reported on in Mitel Connect Director, there seems to be a correlation of either a high MOL, high delay, or both with these calls, but I'm not sure how to troubleshoot this further, mainly because the site uses our organizations main PRIs and no one else has reported any issues with static. We had some issues with one of our PRI recently that were resolved, and I was hoping that might also resolve this, but the problem has persisted now for over a month. 
 Is packet capturing the way to go? Are there any other methods to troubleshooting I should try or common causes for poor delay or MOL? Jitter has notably been perfectly fine across all the troublesome calls.

I went to the ASR 9010 and did “no username Cisco” and “no username root” ,then created both users again and changed password using “secret xxxxx” .So while recreating the users ,I didn’t assign them to respective groups/task groups.So right now on one ASR 9010-I can access it but I can pretty much not do anything on the router ,Not even see running config because the users I created have no privileges and I can’t enter “admin conf” mode to give privileges to a user .
 Is there any way I can fix this screw up ? Any links or suggestions welcome .
 I didn’t screw up the other ASR 9010s,I just went to each user and changed password instead of deleting and recreating a user to give them a password .
 P.s we don’t have Cisco tac access anymore because we are about to handover the devices .Some political bull shit

 Some recent projects have us with some spare (and old) equipment that is probably worth keeping for at least a little while. Our current organization system has them in a anti-static bag at the bottom of a drawer. 
 Anyone have a good suggestion for a cost effective way to organize transceivers and DAC cables? 
 For fiber patch cables we use handing folders in a portable file tote. One folder per cable length works fairly well for what we normally have on-hand. Cables have a little bit of protection, it is easy to grab and take with you and you can very quickly find the length you are looking for.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I think this is a story many of you here can relate to...
 My ex-boss hired me in January of this year. He'd kept the IT dept running on a small budget while putting in the overtime and working weird hours to patch things outside of business time. He made no bones about being overworked but it was obvious he wasn't going anywhere since he'd been there for so long (at least, that's what I had assumed given his long tenure with the company - 15+ years).
 Requests for a larger budget to replace equipment and grow the IT department were universally rejected. There has only been one exception recently which was the addition of my position to the IT team. Apparently this is something my boss had been pushing for years since the company is doing really well and expanding across the board. 
 8 or 9 weeks ago some shit hit the fan, one of the higher ups spoke to my overworked boss in a way that definitely was not well received. All of this revolved around a situation that I'm sure could have been avoided with properly scaling IT to the company's growth. My boss put in his 2 week notice on the spot.
 Fast forward to today - servers are down and multiple services and network storage drives are inaccessible. There are 3 of us at the help desk with no clue how to fix it. There are plenty applicants and interviews to fill the position but I can only assume the salary offers are too low since none of the people who come through are ever heard from again.
 A large part of the company is dead in the water today. Good times.

 i.d.k; some items might take 10 minutes, others might take 3 hours to figure out. It's impossible to say. Also, this has been tertiary priority so far. We've been prioritizing patching and security issues over this.
 Ok, how soon can we deploy this?
 It's impossible to say. Would you like to prioritize this convenience item over patching and security concerns?
 Obviously patching has to come first, but when can we get this one done.
 FFS, ID-F'N-K.

 seriously..... What am I expected to do? just quote some random bullshit time frame that I pull out of my ass on the spot? There are 60ish components in the convenience item, that have to each be individually developed, tested, verified, etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm sure there is a name for this I just don't know what it is. Other than corporate fat.
 All the chatter recently had me thinking about this and I've been helping a farmer the past couple of weekends finish up his harvest where we are hustling all day which is a loose comparison to IT but there's no Pingpong table or game room to slip off to (this is a big company reference). (and feels good for a change of pace.)
 I was thinking about the 8 companies I've worked at over the past 22 years other than the super small companies with 1 or 2 people in the whole IT department every place I've worked at has so many wasted hours. 
 I've hired on at more than one place where they are going on about being swamped and then it's two weeks before I even get a laptop and spend half the day chatting with everyone or listening to them complain about policies. 
 Then in every place with a team of people, there have always one or two superstars and the rest are just there either doing busy work or not really doing anything. 
 Next are all the meetings, the bigger the company the more you have, and the more you just get invited to for no reason other than you replied to an email one time. Of course, there are always people who just love to take advantage of this rather than get work done. 
 I've been on both sides of it too. I worked at one place in the early 2000s where I spent six months going to quiet rooms in the building and spending the day playing Civilization V without anyone noticing or caring. I've also been the superstar who's spent a solid 30-40 hours a week getting something done. 
 This is just my opinion but overall from what I've seen in corporate America the next major recession we are going to see job reductions in IT similar to what happened to manufacturing jobs in 2008. And those job nubmers never returned to pre 2008 levels.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 ​
 I inherited the wonderful responsibility of having to approve new softwares to be introduced to our environment. Basically, as of now, users submit requests for new softwares to the helpdesk, and then they ask my team to review the software prior to allowing it to be installed. The only issue with this current process is that, I have exactly zero idea how other medium sized enterprises validate software. My question is two fold.
 ​
 Firstly, what information do you request from the users when they ask for a new software to be introduced to the environment. So far this is the list i've come up with.
  
1. Is there existing software that can be used
 2. Business need for software
 3. Is this for a project
 4. What is the impact if this software is not approved
 5. What specific task will get done using this software.
  
Secondly, how do you know if the software is safe to introduce? Right now, here is what I do..
  
Run the software installer through our EDR sandbox
 Check if the installation is signed
 Try installing the software on a test box
 Googling the software / the hash
  
The only issue with my current method is that a lot of times our engineers find these really niche tools from github etc that do extremely specific things. I don't have a good way of validating any of these as I can't read through the code and understand what they do in a timely fashion. That would take me several days / weeks if I did that for every software. Any advice would be great!

This is used in our Horizon environment, the UAG points to this for authentication. Since we have had various issues with this server, instead of upgrading the current server, I have been tasked with standing up a new Ubuntu 20.04 LTS server and setting this up with FreeRADIUS and Google Auth, then migrating over the configuration/database to avoid having to enroll all users with Google Auth again. I did some research but did not find too much information on how to easily migrate the Google Auth database to the new server. I found these two articles (Clone and Restore FreeRADIUS Setup and Sharing Google Auth Keys), but I wasn't sure that it would work. Does anyone have experience with a migration like this, who could point me in the right direction?

 What I'm not sure about is this: so inbox 1 last synced 30 minutes ago. Inbox 2 last synced yesterday at 5:54PM. Inbox 3 last synced at 2:21PM. There is still mail arriving to these inboxes, and I want to make sure that no mail get's left behind when I complete the migration and swap the MX records. Does a "final sync" run when I approve or complete the migration batch? And if not, then how do I ensure the mail in the recipient inbox is up-to-date the minute of the switch?
 The mail account domains need to be the same while the migration runs on the sending and receiving end, due to this we can't set a forward that will work. So assuming there is no way to do this "final sync" I suppose I could complete the migration batch on Thursday evening, swap their 365 accounts to .onmicrosoft.com, set up the forward from the Gmail accounts until they leave on Friday while manually sending over the few emails that may have been missed by the migration sync, change the MX, then log on and set up their profiles. Bit of a long way around it but eh there's only 5 users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all, recently purchased a refurb DL380 Gen9 with the NVMe enablement kit (part no 774741-B21 which consists of a PCIe NVMe controller, drive cage with backplane and 3 PCI express cables). I installed 6 x Kingston DC1500M drives (firmware version S67F0103, no newer available) and whilst they all work, I can only get PCI express Gen 3 link speed on port 1 & 2 of the controller. The other 4 drives (port 3, 4, 5 and 6) only operate at Gen 1 link speed.
 Output in lspci with correct speed (port 1 & 2):
  LnkSta: Speed 8GT/s (ok), Width x4 (ok) TrErr- Train- SlotClk+ DLActive- BWMgmt- ABWMgmt- 
 Output in lspci with slower speed (port 3, 4, 5, 6):
  LnkSta: Speed 2.5GT/s (downgraded), Width x4 (ok) TrErr- Train- SlotClk+ DLActive- BWMgmt- ABWMgmt- 
 Things I tried:
  
Reset BIOS: no change. There are also no options to configure link speeds.
 Move drives around: no change. It doesn't matter which drive is connected where, port 1 & 2 run at Gen 3 whilst the other run at Gen 1
 Move cables around: no change
 Swap cable connections: connected port 1 & 2 to port 5 & 6 on the backplane. Still only port 1 & 2 run at Gen 3 whilst the the other run at Gen 1. That rules out a backplane problem
 Swapped NVMe controller: no change
 Connect only port 5 & 6: runs at Gen 3
 Firmware upgrade of NVMe controller: was already at latest version 1.78
 All other firmware is up to date
  
So it looks like in whatever combination, I can only get 2 of the 6 drives to run at full Gen 3 speed whilst the other downgrade to Gen 1. There are some jumpers on the NVMe controller but I can't find any documentation on what they do and I doubt it's going to make a difference anway. Needless to say this quite kneecaps the performance of the NVMe drives... Anything else I can try?

I have to achieve this with IPv6 as well, it seems some of our equipment doesn't support 6VPE, my question is, would there be any other way to accomplish this for IPv6 in this case? 
 Looks like I can't have different VRFs for IPv4 and IPv6 in the same interface nor can have IPv6 in the main routing table while the interface is part of a VRF
 
 We have an anti-DDoS system that injects routes via BGP to modify the communities for the attacked /24s, currently, this doesn't modify the next-hop (we keep the next-hop intact) we just modify the community in order to tell the edge routers "stop all broadcasts to all transits but the scrubbing capable ones". However, being that this is going to use AF VPNv4 and VPNv6 I don't see how I can just keep the next-hop unaltered nor how I could set this up. 
 I can't just tell the network "the next-hop is the loopback of core/dist-1" like we currently do, since now the network is inside of a VRF
 Just to clarify, the anti-DDoS injects a route with a higher LPREF than the ones advertised by the core/dist switches at this moment, this causes the edge routers to prefer that one and apply policies based on the communities present on that specific one 
 
 I have also concerns about scalability, we currently have ASR1004/1006 with RP2@16GB and receive full routing tables from prov-2 and prov-1, IXP routes from prov-3 and around 50k routes from prov-4 (and this is only IPv4)
  
Our equipment is a mix of Huawei CE68XX and Cisco ASR1004/1006. 
 Any ideas, hints, or guidelines, especially if you have solved an issue like this before would be really appreciated.

 ​
 1) IF we implement UPD for every folders, should we remove the folder redirection for, or we can keep both?
 2) Since we already have local profiles on the first RDS, is it easy to implement a 2nd RDS build a farm and configure UDP, or we will have to rebuild local users folder on both servers since the C:\users will be in the UPD instead of the server itself?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been trying to find a way to scan all our mobile devices for their eSIM capability and so far I've come up empty.
 We are considering switching from physical SIM cards to eSIM but did not take note of the IDs when we received the devices. And we've got a few different iterations of devices even within the same modell (Gen1, Gen2, ..) so it isn't entirely clear to us which devices support eSIM or not.
 Scanning for regular broadband internet capability is easy enough:
  
netsh mbn show interfaces
  
And even getting information about regular SIM cards is no problem:
  
netsh mbn show read interface=*
  
But I can't find an easy way to figure out whether a device supports eSIM or not.
 Reading https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/intune/configuration/esim-device-configuration and https://www.petervanderwoude.nl/post/configuring-esim-profiles-on-windows-devices/ lead me to believe that I somehow should be able to get at least the ICCID somehow. But the first netsh command above only returns the regular broadband adapter with no hint whether the device supports eSIM or not.
 Further reading brought me to https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/mb-esim-operations and the "Hardware Lab Kit" test from Microsoft which is supposed to feature a "netsh mbn test feature=esim" test but ... this feels way out of scope (settings up a HLK server and whatnot) for something that ... I feel should be a lot simpler.
 The only way I've found so far is manually checking the broadband settings GUI of the settings app for the availability of eSIM profiles. Which is ... not great for automation.
 Does anyone have a better idea on how to scan for eSIM capability? (Preferably something PowerShell or cmd.exe (netsh) if needed. No Azure or Intune (we use SCCM).)

 ​
 At my wits end here and not sure where else to turn since Microsoft are unable to help.
 ​
 We recently have been trialling a new backup solution, to start with it was working fine, then when we expanded it to more servers we started seeing the issue where the avhdx files are being created but cannot be merged because "Error: The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process. (0x80070020)"
 ​
 We also have an important server that we want replicated to another site and are unable to replicate because the HRL file also cannot be processed because of the same error.
 ​
 This is affecting multiple servers, with different versions of windows, 2016, 2019 and 2022.
 ​
 Suspected a windows update, removed the last few and rebooted, no change, removed the backup solutions agent and rebooted, same, no change.
 ​
 As a temporary fix, I shut down the VM, removed the VHDX file from the VM settings and moved it to a different folder then re-added the file to VM settings.
 ​
 Checkpoints seem to work and the backup solution will run fine manually, but then it will eventually stop working again.
 ​
 We used to use Veeam, but this has been removed. We also have another solution installed that we were going to use but never configured. I believe this is based around Acronis, but as I said, its not running anything, just installed.
 ​
 Any suggestions?
 ​

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For weeks now I have been trying to wrap my head around a problem I just can't figure out. I'll try to explain it as best as I can.
 We are providing our users with Dell Latitute computers. At the moment we have anything from 7490 to 7430, and somewhere around 5320/7420 the problems started to arise.
 We issue our users with Jabra Evolve2 65 headsets so they can participate in Skype for Business meetings (we are not allowed to use Teams, don't ask...). It all seems to be working well, until after a week or two when the users who have been issued with a new computer comes back and complains that Skype is crashing when they use the headset. If they connect the USB dongle whatever sound settings you open (be it Skype or Windows), will freeze the program. 
 I thought it was just a simple problem with Jabra, but after testing more thoroughly it turns out the problems are there for any USB sound dongle from any brand. We've tried updating the Realtek driver, and that works but only for a while once again, or just makes the Sound settings incredibly slow to navigate, not entirely frozen. Its also not universal which computers work decently with new drivers, and which will still not work.
 The problem is now big enough we can't decide on new headsets to buy, because we simply don't know if we can make them work. Are we the only ones with this issue, or has someone else found a solution to get us through this dongle hell hole?

The few things i've tried are using the windows 11/10 pro general key under the windows-setup/UserData/ProductKey, not having the point to having the point but no licesnse.

 How do you guys usually handle this?

 I'd preferably not have a license in the unattend file, since the computers all come with pro, and I want to activate the already given license.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have experience working with dual boot pc-s, setting them up and hacking them (in the old sense of the word) but only 1 at a time. Now, I the computer science teacher became the sysadmin of the school where I teach and I should get them in shape. Now Ubuntu and Windows 10 Pro are installed and every PC has one user with admin rights (yikes!). I would like to change this.
 I have a general idea and I know that I'm capable of hacking something together but I would like to do it in a proper way, e.g. in a way which probably requires me to put in more effort in the beginning but it should then spare me headaches in the future.
 My idea in general is the following: Students should learn how to (de)install apps, use said apps + MS Office + webbrowsing, get to know the OS-s (Windows 10 Pro and Ubuntu), learn the basics of fotoshop, do some programming in Python and execute them in the command line. On the other hand, it would be nice if let's say after midnight every PC would return to its original state which would prevent the students to do nasty stuff. The student would need to store everything in the cloud of on a USB-stick. The cherry on the pie would be the fact that the PC-s update themselves whenever needed. I'm thinking about maybe even creating a user for every student? But that seems a bit unnecessary, given that they can only access the PC-s in the school and not much else.
 Is there any software which already has this bundle? Or how does one achieve these goals without reinventing the wheel?

 On my laptop Dell Latitude 5410 ( with Windows 10 ) I have installed VMware Workstation Player 16 and inside it I have an AlpineLinux ( with static IP 192.168.1.114 ) with a VPNC client for company private networks . For this I use a route in windows ( route add 10.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0 192.168.1.114 -p ).
 When I use Ethernet connection (cable) everything works fine, but when I use Wifi card/connection I can't connect to these private networks.
 The VPNC client connects to the networks and I have connectivity to the private networks from AlpineLinux but not from Windows.
 I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling the network drivers (wifi and ethernet) and nothing changes.
 On that VM I use the "Bridged: Directly connected to physical network" connection.
 Thanks a lot.

 I'm into a system admin and a lot of things about. I'm kind of new into the subject and I think it's very interesting and stimulating as well as rewarding.
 I have a problem since i'm working with windows desktop base machine and these days the windows update are actually breaking the link with the AD or Domain.
 I'd like to know if there's a possibility to disable Windows Updates "forever"/OnceForAll" with a policy in the AD. I'd like to have a group policy so nobody can't update windows or better. That no one is able to choose that option.
 I don't know if it sounds like very difficult or if there's way to deactivate for a group.
 Thanks alot in advance.
 I've been learning a lot the couple of month and I think with the redditors and community I feel motivated and please keep learning and sharing. =)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there fellow Sysadmins!
 I‘d like to have some advice on a migration/integration topic:
 I was tasked to plan the integration of the infrastructure of another company into mine.
 Both infrastructures contain an Active Directory and Azure Environment as well as Intune/Endpoint manager.
 Needless to say that I’ve never done that before – and my knowledge of Active Directory stems from my apprenticeship which was many years ago. In the meantime, I’ve worked with an IAM solution like Okta. 
 While the way the new accounts are created follow a fully automatic process,
 I wonder if there is an “easy” way to migrate all mailboxes, teams, groups, and MDM devices. All I found were guides that seem to include a huge amount of manual work – or deeper knowledge of PowerShell. There solutions might turn out to be frictionless and not that hard, but I cannot evaluate that based on my knowledge/experience.
 So, I see two ways to solve that problem:
 1) Get into the PowerShell Scrips to automate parts of the progress
 2) Search for a full featured migration tool that handles the work for me
 For the second point – of course it will be less effort, but my main concern on that topic is time. It must be done as soon as possible. 
 I am looking forward to getting some new insides into this.
 Thanks in advance for every advice

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Folks,
 I'm looking for some guidance as a very green sysadmin. I've recently joined a new MSP as a Support Engineer. I went out to work on a VPN connection issue the other day and noticed something extremely badly configured. I suspect the reason we're having so many issues is that the clients' LAN is on a 192.168.1.x/24 subnet...the most common subnet ISP routers provide.
 I'm fairly new here, but I looked around the firewall and found a ton of NAT rules that are basically trying to get around this problem of "What happens when you're on 192.168.1.x and you try to connect via SSL VPN to LAN that is also 192.168.1.x so you can RDP into a machine " 
 Obviously, this is a bad configuration I think what needs to happen is that network needs to be on VLAN with a more corporate-friendly subnet(172.x.x.x or 10.x.x.x) but I honestly don't know where to start. No one's going to fix it without a nudge, or they might do something nutty like I've seen already and just make an interface with a 172.x.x.x IP on the firewall and NAT *Everything* through that. Where do I start with a plan to fix this network?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone, 
 I´m having a problem regarding a surface pro 7.
 I wanted to reinstall windows on said surface using a bootstick I prepared with Windows 10.
 I accidentally picked the wrong stick with Surface Hub OS on it.
 Since the installation is the same as a normal Win10 installation I ran through it and noticed that I installed Surface Hub OS on my Surface Pro 7,
 Now I tried to get rid of it in the following ways:
  
Win10 Bootstick
 LinuxLive Bootstick
 Surface Reset Stick with Serial Number
 Surface Hub Reset Stick with Serial Number (from a real Surface hub because the Surface Pro 7 isn´t a Surface Hub)
 Resetting the UEFI firmware
  
Everything I tried didn´t work.
 When trying to boot from USB it either kicks me back to BIOS or it just boots up SurfaceHub.
 Since the UEFI firmware reset it gives a red line on the bootscreen but it kicks me back to BIOS though.
 I don´t know what to do since MS Professionals recommend booting from a Win10 stick *facepalm*
 I hope someone can help.
 PS: I already heard someone say "just get the ssd out and partition it on another device" but since it´s a surface and I don´t want any soldering action I don´t want to try that.

I am looking for a compatible docking station for both laptops and my periphery devices. Something I can just connect one laptop, and then pull out and connect the other laptop (one at a time). I have been looking at the Targus 190 and the Dell WD 19TBS. 
 I was also wondering can you hook up a KVM switch to a docking station? So that you can just switch between the computers with a press of a button? If no, can you hook up a KVM switch to a monitor? I have the UGREEN USB 3.0 Switch - but it somehow doesn't hook up my monitor.

 Thanks for your help - sorry if these questions are a bit "dumb".

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 I got a question but I feel like I first have to explain the background a little bit: I have a customer with very specific requests. They need a system of 4 client and 2 server machines (will all be Windows 11 / Windows Server 2022) together with some additional network hardware (NAS, printers). The special thing is that this small network will run completely isolated and will not be connected to WAN or any other networks (for a fact I'm planning on physically plugging non used LAN ports on all devices). They need an AD running but only with generic users (Factory User, Storage User and so on) and no personal users. One of the servers will function as a Domain Controller. And They need that exact same system running on several different sites across the country. Like it has to be exactly the same, down to every single AD user.
 So since the the setup will be identical on all sites and not connected to the outside whatsoever, I had the idea to set this up in my lab one time, configure it to the customers likes and then just take images from every machine. If then the order for a site arrives, I could just use my specific images to prepare the machines. I've done it like that before but never with an AD involved, hence my questions. Oh and we use Symantec Ghost for imaging, if that matters. So here my questions:
  
Can you think of anything arguing against cloning AD machines, for example a Domain Controller?
 When I clone all machines after they are added to the AD and then restore these images on other machines, will they be added properly to the new site's AD (since the hostnames get cloned as well) or will this be spotty? I could join them to the AD manually for each site if need be, but it would increase the workload.
 Overall thoughts / input on my plan?
  
Thanks in advance and have a nice week.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[my office was recently hit by the Lockbit3.0 ransomware, we had 2 servers, 1 is linked to the internet (mainly for file sharing and storage) , the other only linked to local network (for accounting and other related programmes database and sharing). The offline one is completely dead everything locked which is wiped and reinstall. The other one my employee unplugged when it was "being infected" so only around 40% files locked. Personally i suspect its from phishing email or something, Our IT consultant (external, with us for about 10 years) says they could have somehow found out network vulnerability and hacked us. (which i find unbelievable). And he suggest us to upgrade both the servers and buy some other anti virus and such. amounting to around USD 10k each. (im not from US).
 I personally dont see how this can prevent the same thing to happen next time, but i do agree one of the server is quite old so could do some upgrade. just looking at other options here.
 i have read about synology or NAS or cloud stuff, in fact anything is welcomed as im not an IT guy. we have around 15 employees, max 20, usually all need to use the printers, server files and programme concurrently. 
 Thanks

 One adom is in 5.4 version, with fortigates (6.0.9). According to one engineer they had some issues when performing upgrade, so want to delete the specific 5.4 adom before upgrading, and add back the Fortigates after upgrade.
 I'm not very familiar with FMG, but was thinking about creating a new 6.0 adom and moving the devices there (or even the root adom) instead of deleting. Would that work? Also, what happens to the policy packages? Will they be moved along or do we have to move manually? Would moving policies from 5.4 adom to 6.0 adom screw with the objects?

Core switch has vlan 100 on an svi and doesn't tag the downstream switch. Downstream also has vlan 100 and an svi on a different subnet. If I'm on the Downstream switches network ssh is good across all devices. All svi's are pingable anywhere though. I can't change the Downstream switches physical ip's because of the amount of devices assigned. If I migrate the Downstream switches vlans from 100 to the root ip assignment I think on vlan 1 I think I will fix the issue. Any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 Hoping for a bit of help with this one as it's driving me crazy.
 I've got a handful of users whose laptop intermittenly will boot them off wifi, and take 1-3 minutes to be able to rejoin a wifi network. 
 This only occurs on the corporate network at the office, only on windows 11 computers (But not to all windows 11 computers).
 Wifi setup is some older Meraki mr18's (I know I want them upgraded, but budgets). I've been unable to replicate this on my own device.
 Wifi drivers are at latest, devices are 1-3 year old dell latitudes, win 11 at latest version.
 The only error that might be related that I can find in the logs is the below:
 The server could not bind to the transport \Device\NetBT_Tcpip_{7579EFB6-7F3D-4D48-B802-A9E2614865D9} because another computer on the network has the same name. The server could not start. 
 They seem to think that another device has the same hostname as them (Despite this 100% not being the case).
 No errors on the DHCP server.
 Issue does not appear when the laptops are connected to other external networks, IE Home, the coffee shop, etc
 I have been pulling my hair out about this for weeks and the best available on google is "It's a non issue it doesn't mean anything", "Turn off power saving on the device" (Didn't work), and other similar inneffective fixes. 
 I would love a second set of eyes, thanks in advance guys!

I saw some suggestions that disabling all the privacy/security features on the phones may resolve the issue, but it is not a great look to ask users to kneecap their own device security because we can't be bothered to fix our configuration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 So, long story short, I just started re-modeling network for one of customers and the problem is I need to put 12U of hardware to 9U cabinet…
 The easiest solution would be obviously to replace current cabinets with proper ones but as always there’s a caveat. They all are “build in” the walls. Recessed about 30cm and welded directly to metal construction of the building.
 Replacing them would be extremely difficult and expensive and would include painting all 4 offices…
 So my “standard” setup for each of them is
 24 port patch panel for fiber
 48 port patch panel for CCTV
 Two or three 48 port patch panels for regular network jacks 
 Aggregation switch for fiber that’s linking all 4 buildings and for all others switches from the cabinet
 Separate cctv switch that has its own fiber uplink to the main server room 
 Two or three switches for regular network 
 2U NVR for CCTV
 2U UPS also for CCTV
 it’s minimum of 12 and in the biggest building 14U
 Just writing that I realized that I could move all NVRs to the main server room, I don’t like having all eggs in one basket but that is kind of not much of a choice situation. But this is still at best 1U or 2U above my rack size.
 In all of that “desperation” I started thinking that maybe I could somehow secure UPS outside, to the bottom of the rack cabinet? OMG

I followed Microsoft's documentation and met all the specified requirements, but encountered a bug which prevented me from using Connect-IPPSSession.
 When running the command with a known-working app and certificate, I was given the modern auth user signing dialog. This didn't happen with the Connect-ExchangeOnline cmdlet. 
 After some frustration, I finally found a recent stackexchange post which described this issue, and provided a workaround. 
 The issue appears to be that the module assumes the existence of an environment variable that only exists in Powershell Core. The workaround is to manually provide that value in your script by adding this:
 $Global:IsWindows = $true
 I'm not sure how to report this bug to the correct team at Microsoft. It was reported in the Powershell github, but closed there.

 By chance, today I found it's already available here

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone here have a recommendation for aggregating and forwarding logs? I will be likely implementing an MSSP in the next few months, but expect I will likely will want to supplement with my own logging platform for non-security related purposes. I don't want to have to change the configuration throughout my environment if I decide to add a second destination or change MSSPs. I would like to have a single point of aggregation and distribution for my logs. 
 It appears using Windows Event Forwarder for my Windows systems and a syslog-ng system for everything else might work, but in both cases, it seems like there might be real-world issues as platforms may misinterpret the source for all events as being the two forwarders.
 Everything I find on this topic seems to be cover centralizing at one point, but nothing about then forwarding again. Maybe there is a good reason?

 I have a dual boot setup with 2 separate drives, as well as a storage drive. I would like to isolate the other main drive and storage drive from the current Windows 11 installation and set up a Local Group Policy to prevent drive attribute changes.
 I'm aware that it is possible to add a policy to prevent a user from accessing a drive in My Computer but the policy states that:
  
Also, this policy setting does not prevent users from using programs to access these drives or their contents. And, it does not prevent users from using the Disk Management snap-in to view or change drive characteristics. I'm also aware that an administrator can reverse these changes but I'm trying to make it difficult for a user without administrative rights to change these conditions.
  
Can someone help me please? Thank you.

This led me to write a book about it when many of the most common problems are addressed. As the introduction already implies, it is fairly impossible to cover all aspects of the entire linux storage stack, as the storage ecosystem is vast. Nevertheless, I do think it covers a lot of what you might/will encounter in your daily work.

 Am I over thinking it? Just because we have a decent firewall doesn't mean we should be disabling other security measures that are there to protect us.

 I had many issues during the upgrading. I am using these switches in stacking mode with 2 or 3 stack members. I read that, these switches are upgradeable in stacking mode, so I don't need to upgrade that individually.
 There are my experiencies:

Last year I upgraded a stack with 3 members from 2.5.5.47 to 2.5.8.15. I uploaded the new fw via WebGui then rebooted the switch stack. After that the network is gone on these switches.
 The problem was that the switch config is modified during the upgrade. All settings on TenGigabitEhternet port is gone. Meanwhile I had problem with the switch password. I couldn't login with my previously used password, so I had to do a Password Recovery via console cable.

My first thought was to use a fiber optic cable, but i'd rather use cat 5e since its cheaper. Im going to connect the cable to a telekom speedport smart 4. 
 My questions now are:
  
Will the solar panel cables cause any interference, even if i use a shielded cable?
 Will i need to boost the signal with a switch or something?

 full disk Imaging is a potential solution but creates problems elsewhere in the chain.

 When someone logs in with an alias and tries to access the farm they get the error attached here.
 What I checked:
  
It happens randomly to people in the domain.
 
There are some that work great for them and some that work for him.
 
 In terms of comparisons between computers, I compared hardware, software, operating systems, versions, etc.
  
I checked logs on RDS itself and on the broker server.
  
The broker servers work in HA configuration.
  
I checked the correct settings of the alias.
 
I dug each and every post on Google and various forums!
 
 ​
 Facts about the environment:
 All 2019 operating systems, the most advanced versions of Windows 10.
 Defaulttsvurl is the alias definition in the RDS environment, and it worked fine until this issue occurred.
 ​
 I would appreciate your help because I can't quite find myself anymore.
 Thanks!

 I have used both Akamai and Cloudflare on previous companies. Both of which basically did the job of hiding our origin, and also the basics in filtering traffic and some caching (with various success).
 In this case the only requirement is that the WAF service is operated by a European based company. The rest is probably more like, work with what you get. Since I don't expect the same type of services like Cloudflare where i can easily hook up an existing Terraform provider have the automation done within a few hours.

The company has used PRTG for many years and there has never been a single app owner so it has accumulated a lot of garbage and there has been no standard ever put in place. This includes older servers using different SNMP strings, random WMI sensors, local users and groups in PRTG, etc. I am wanting to completely remodel our system and give it the attention it needs. I am also attempting to do this without too much monitoring downtime and effort. My question is though, how would other recommend setting up data center monitoring? Should I break it into folders like servers, networking, environmental. Then break it down into domain controllers, specific app, firewalls, switches, UPS, ATS, Genset, etc. Or should I break it down into different VLANs/Networks so I can use the auto discover feature?

 We did note there is a vent on the top of the chassis but find it hard to believe this is related to cooling since the server is designed to be rack mounted on top of other servers without any spacing.
 This has caused some political issues with our site guys who are now insisting we space them out by 1RU which kinda defeats the purpose of purchasing a high density 1RU solution. Might as well go DL380 which is 2RU and get the extra storage capacity, but we want 1RU because our bottleneck is CPU cores.
 Anyone had any similar experience with these servers? HPE support were less than helpful lets just say.

(No, I haven't looked at Event logs to further understand why this is the case.)
 It's not my environment. Technically I may be able to access SCCM/MEM, perhaps create a special group for these older systems in order to deploy individual patches identified as being missing. Anyone else have ideas? Anything to beat remoting in.

 I tried to see with wireshark if I get a new connection when I go through the hyperlinks,but I struggled to understand the behavior .When I click on some links with the same domain there is no tcp handshake but with others there is a handshake
 ​
 so when looking at the link I found that the ones that establish new tcp connection uses the rel attribute rel="bookmark" and I think that it is the src of this behavior can some explain if I'm in the correct path or I'm just doing some nonsense thanks for your response I'm still a noob so please bear with me

 IDk exactly if this question is off topic or not but making it simple , here it goes like : 
 My company is running Cisco anyconnect servers + OpenConnect servers on some specific URLs with load balancing and different managements which non of them is making me a problem other than the network my clients are sitting in and the problem is that :
 I have multiple clients sitting behind a firewall that doesn't let them have access to OC/CA servers of that company on that specific port and URL but There is an other client(server) in this network that can pass this firewall without any problem and I can run my own domain on this client So the question will simply be what Kind of hardware or software do I need on that specific client to make a bridge into company's servers without extra routing, encryption/decryption and SSL certification ? Is HAProxy capable of doing this ? Do i need Remote SSL offloading ? 
 ​
 In other terms : Something like a Proxy that takes OpenConnect/Cisco requests from clients on the inside network and just forwards them to original servers without regulation ? I want Clients to not change anything other than the URL 
 ​
 And there are reasons why I want this scenario to be unchanged so please understand that I'm not looking for better ways of doing something like this but rather making this work

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm tasked with finding a UPS solution for our company's server rack. Adding up the servers' power consumption from what their PSUs are capable of I got to around 10kW. So this means with all servers at 100% load a minimum of 10kW is needed to supply enough power to keep the devices running. I figured, to be safe, I'd recommend getting UPS units totaling about 12kW to allow enough time for a graceful shutdown in case of a power outage.
 My coworker thinks this is overkill and he'd rather we get a UPS just big enough for our average daily load. It'd be more work to measure all our servers' power consumption but it'd save us money. He also believes we just need UPS to cover for power fluctuations and spikes.
 Is it feasible, if safe at all, to "skimp" on UPS like that? I'm not great at putting my thoughts on the table and my coworker has spent more time in the company than I did so if the answer to the previous question is no then I'll need convincing arguments.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yes, there may be SOME features that VMWare still have that Proxmox VE doesn't have (and features Proxmox VE has that VMWare never will, like built-in backups). But let me tell you, for my hypervisor in my home datacentre, I have continually had value in Proxmox VE in the 10 years I've been running and upgrading it.
 I started with Proxmox VE v2.3, 2x node cluster, which has expanded over time to 3x node cluster and upgraded over the literal decade to now v7.2-11. Same cluster, upgraded in-place. Earlier versions were a touch rocky to do major version upgrades on, but documentation was there, and I was able to get it sorted.
 Over the decade I've not only had performance improvements on the same hardware, but new features, and all sorts of great things. I update with some regularity (several times per year).
 I went to take a backup of my VM and found a feature suddenly there that I didn't know I needed. "Protected". I can take backups that don't get auto-pruned by my backup task! SO AWESOME!
 Also, Proxmox VE gave me an HTML5 local console to my VMs months/years before VMWare even had it, and Proxmox VE did it so much better (so much more responsive).
 And these are just some examples.
 So, I gotta say, fuckin'eh to the Proxmox VE devs! I don't know if you read this. But I tip my hat to all involved in the Proxmox VE development ecosystem. Thanks!

 We are currently prepping our first windows 11 image for rollout via Desktop Central and are having a ton of random issues.
 After deployment the OS will not open a ton of apps (no errors and no processes start) including settings, paint, ms store, notepad to name a few. This seems to be happening across any hardware we try it on. If I try to run settings via task manager I get an 'this app is not installed' prompt. 
 I've ran SFC, DISM, with no errors found / no improvement. I can't really get to much else to try to repair the install/apps either (settings is completely dead).
 It is worth noting that the current windows 11 version we have been testing with is Enterprise 22H2. We have tried fresh installs of 22H2, upgrading from windows 10 to windows 11 and running updates, as well as updating from 21H1 to 22H2. Due to the nature of the business/our security policy we can't deploy anything below the latest MS patched device even if the latest version is unstable (yeah idk).
 Any ideas/comments?
 ​
 TLDR: Does Windows 11 Suck or do I just suck? inb4 both.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 Trying to see if we can get some feedback on a problem we are experiencing in a site we recently took on. We had this problem almost daily around September where all inbound traffic would stop while all of our VPN tunnels stay up to our other 2 sites. When this happens bandwidth at the firewall on our WNA interface and our LAN interface is both minimal, 4-5 mbps if now lower. The problem disappeared till it started again a few days ago. The ISP says something on our end is maxing out their AdTran 5660 CPU causing it to start discarding packets. I feel like I should be able to see a spike on our firewall in traffic if we are in essence almost DOSing their router. We have mostly used Cisco Meraki and Fortinet in the past so Juniper is not our strong suit but from what I can tell they seem to be setup correctly to handle broadcast storms etc., but I could be missing something. Any suggestions on where I should start looking? 
 ​
 Some background on the site:
 Fortigate 400E firewall (handling DHCP)
 Juniper EX4600 Core fiber switch 
 Mix of EX 3400 and EX2300 switches throughout the site (around 25)
 Previous admins have the site setup flat with one large subnet (/20)
 Major things running on network are around 200 Hikvision cameras and 10 or so DVRS, around 100ish IP based clocks/speakers in rooms. 
 Site is running Ruckus APs and Zone Controller.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'll try to make this short. Started my career in IT last November when I started working as an IT field technician for a telecom company. Things were good at first but having to drive around didn't cities to provide support for 30+ sites got old even though my schedule was pretty flexible with no one to directly report to in my immediate coverage area.
 Got tired of being away from home and felt like I also hit a ceiling as far as knowledge goes. The position focused very much on hardware over software and didn't feel like I could further advance my career by staying at current company.
 Fast forward to November 1st this year. I started a new position with a different company that has more of a focus on Windows products ( Windows Server, Office products, etc). The previous IT guy they had at the company unfortunately passed away back in June from cancer. With that he also left no documentation whatsoever when it came to passwords, credentials, anything for that matter. 
 Now I'm dealing with a Windows Server that is currently running on an evaluation version because they were attacked by Ransomware back in September which caused them to restore their server without a license I guess? They are also using a combination of Google docs and Office 2016.
 I've already bright these items up to the CFO who is my direct report and I don't think he understands the sense of urgency to have these items implemented

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for some feedback, and thoughts on how to be better at my job. I'm an Architecture / Engineering manager, in prior lives I've been in development, ops, infrastructure, data center, all at the same company. It's a really big environment, and I've gotten a reputation for understanding how most of it fits together.
 I've been a manager for about 3 years now, finally feel like I know what I'm doing, but mostly with a small team. I'm probably too hands on/ in the weeds, and I like to work on side projects still, but I get good feedback from my team, and boss/ peers. My team's going to double in a few weeks, and I've been a bit worried about coming off as a know-it-all, or a micromanager to the new folks. I try to be cognizant of setting a goal and letting the team figure out the best way to get there, but I definitely have opinions about how we should be building things.
 So, I guess my question is how do you prefer to interact with your boss, when they're not just the people manager? Do you like having them help figure things out, or would you rather they stay out of your way and let you come to them? Or those of you that are in this situation, how do you balance it?
 Hope that didn't come across too self centered, thanks for the consideration

 We encountered an issue where a customer was attempting to run an RFC 2544 test along a circuit we provide. The circuit will pass on all tests except for the small MTU sizes of 64 and 256. We see a drop in line rate on the throughput tests to about 750Mbps for 64 byte and 820Mbps for 256 byte.
 We are using the ASR 900 and ASR 920 routers for each end of this circuit. It’s a L2VPN point-to-point circuit designated at 1Gbps. 
 Has anyone else had any luck getting their RFC 2544 tests to pass with these routers at the lower MTU sizes? It seems like there could be a CPU limitation preventing these smaller sizes from achieving line rate throughput.
 Thanks for any help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I’ve got an issue I run into every month with a specific server when patching. When shutting down after the monthly CU has been prepared the server sits at Getting Windows ready… for anything up to a couple of hours.
 This is the only Server that does this.
 It has the following roles 
 AD Domain Controller File Services inc. deduplication 
 The server is a hyper-v virtual machine
 When I open resource monitor on the hyper-v host I can see a lot of disk activity, but oddly it’s on the vhd that acts as the storage location for the file services on the server. 
 There is approx 4TB of data, all small files.
 Can anyone advise why the update process seems to be so interested in that location? Is this normal from others experience of large file servers?
 Any insights much appreciated.

 iam not sure if its matter where to start robocopy cmdlet.
 For example:
 Source: MS Fileserver
 Target: NetApp Volume
 Would it make a difference to start my robocopy job directly on the source server instead of an admin machine on the same network? When I start the job on my admin machine, would it be a additional hop (cache) for the files, so the copy would take longer?
 ​
 Thanks in advanced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm looking for some level of understanding with Cisco Hyperflex. We will hopefully getting official training on it soon, but my team is being asked to take over a multi-site Hyperflex solution that was created by, well lets just call them non-IT people to be nice, and my first impression is that it wasn't built right. But they insist they followed all the Cisco recommendations. So I have some questions I'm hoping to figure out before I get called at 3am on a Saturday.
 First, the way these systems are configured is there is 6 VMware hosts, all with 6 SSDs in them, then the 7th server is the Hyperflex management server or something. Each server has a single NIC with 2 ports, 25Gbit, connected to two different switches. Those NICs are handling anything Hyperflex, VMware DRS, VMware Management, storage, and VM traffic itself. 
 Questions:
 1 - I've always gone with the school of thought that 1 single dual port NIC isn't very good for redundancy, but they insist this is the Cisco recommendation, are they really right?
 2 - I also would never shove everything through those two nics, is this also Cisco's recommendation?
 3 - The storage in VMware looks like iSCSI, but I haven't been able to get hands on. Where does the iSCSI adapters on the VMware host connect to as a SAN provider? Is it the management server? What happens when it crashes?
 4 - Is the Hyperflex storage like VSAN where there is a replication delay? if so, how long is that delay?
 5 - They told me DRS should be turned off for Hyperflex. Is that true? IF so, why?
 I guess open ended, is there any other tidbits of info you can supply me? Imagine that you are being asked to support a pair of these systems in different geographic locations, without ever seeing the damn thing ever.
 That's me

I'm having trouble getting the Meraki online, it states ethernet connect to local network "Static Frame-Route IP". However, I can't connect to the Meraki dashboard. For now I will set that problem aside as I foresee a larger problem. We have another partner that has their own appliance and must be completely separate from us physically. Before we had a switch that would split that connection and let them pull down their public IP, the problem is I don't know how that's going to work in a leased line situation where they typically have a /32 for the PPPoE connection?

 ​
 What is the best practice for deploying a firewall for a CDN service hosted in on-prem DC?
 ​
 So, as we know, traffic in CDN networks is mostly outbound and the ratio can be 1:99, where only 1% are requests from the Internet to the CDN, and 99% are responses from the CDN to the Internet. On the one hand, we are obliged to use a firewall and requests from the Internet to the CDN service must pass through it. But should the return traffic go through the firewall? For example it might be possible that traffic from the Internet is only 1 Gbit/s, while outgoing traffic can reach hundreds of Gbit/s and it seems unreasonable to use firewall for outgoing traffic, because we trust our servers, plus we need a more expensive firewall. But on the other hand, if the return traffic won't pass through the firewall, the routing setup will be a bit tricky, plus we'll get asymmetric routing and so on...
 ​
 So, again:
 What is the best practice for deploying a firewall for a CDN service hosted on-prem DC?

 The end users had access to the contents on this vhdx which was mounted on one of the VMs from this ext HDD. I just can't see how that was possible considering hyper-v won't even boot a VM with this vhdx added, regardless it can't even be mounted to be explored.
 Is it possible to mount or attach a vhdx stored on a fat32 drive so we can explore the contents?

 So this week we suddenly had a load of users who all needed their account unlocked. Upon investigation what had happened was we had external attempts of multiple logins to azure ad power shell that had failed and triggered the lockout policy.
 The attempts were clearly scripted as we had hundreds in a matter of seconds, all from different countries. The logins have since died down.
 I could find a conditional access policy to specifically block Azure AD power shell but found a post where you can block all apps then allow all the apps you use. This makes me nervous so currently have it in report only mode.
 This got me thinking how easy it would be for a malicious actor to do a DOS attack on a company which could cause a real outage and if there is a true way to protect against these attacks?
 Any ideas?
 Thanks

 Within a few hours of opening a session in some cases we can see handle count for explorer.exe reaching 250,000+.
 Seeing it on mostly Windows 10 but also Server 2012 R2.
 When I run handle.exe tool it just has like 200,000 entries all in the root of the share and this is often without any applications running or files being opened (i.e. the share is just mapped/user has opened a connection to it at some point)
 Thought it might be AV or Windows Updates but have temporarily disabled AV and installed latest patches but problem still occurs.
 Not sure how to investigate why explorer is just continuously opening these handles and then proceeding to not close them/letting them just pile up. Thought it was a server issue but this is happening across multiple different SMB servers/independent storage systems.

 By default, the app creates a database dump whenever you upgrade it.
 Cool, I thought. Upgraded it with few clicks. Closed the ticket – went on with my day thinking that it worked out fine. Nope. I received an E-Mail that the entire configuration from the users was gone.
 I looked into it and, yes, all the things that they were working on were gone. Communicated the situation to my other admin colleague and to the key users. Then I tried restoring the data from the database dump. This did not work because the database scheme has been upgraded as well, and we would have to revert the app to the older version to make the restore file compatible.
 So, I went into test environment, downloaded the older version of said app, installed it, but no. It did not downgrade. Apparently you'd have to uninstall the app first and then reinstall the older version. Sure thing, so I did just that (on the test environment) and tried to restore the backup there. Failed. Nothing happened when I click on the button to restore the data. And I also cannot restore the data on the test environment as the database dump only applies to the prod environment (due to the upgrade).
 Note that this is not the first time that this happened. We've had the same issue with this app around 1 month ago, where I created a ticket. Apparently it was a bug, which then got hotfixed. (We even tested it and it worked). But now we are back to where we've been in the beginning. I reopened the ticket, and I'm still waiting for feedback.
 Got a message that this issue has been perceived very negatively, and I understand. Now they want me to get the app working ASAP or I might get fired, but there's not much I can do.
 Yikes.

 Some good tool for keeping track of everything i have my pipeline as i tend to be unorganized and forgetful unless I have good documentation. 
 This is purley for personal use to gain an upper edge in my role as infrastructure/application manager. 
 I don't mind having to host and /or set ut a lot of it on my own part. I find that enjoyable.

 WIll be greatful for all suggestions, just started looking into it, but I thought i would throw out the question to see if anyone had some suggestions on the top of their mid.

 My asset system is easy to manage and assign to users/facilities via asset tags, but it’s all the same to me how they’re named since I can find them and their primary users through many pipelines.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello. I’m looking to figure out an oversubscription model for our WAN locations. We have many branch locations that are fed by MPLS services with no current option to add local internet access. Our wireless is centralized and we have no appetite at this time to change to flex-connect. 
 So, knowing this, I’ve landed on a minimum bandwidth of approx 3.5Mbps per client. I haven’t nailed down the amount of clients yet but I have a method to figure that out. What I’m struggling with is how much oversubscription to go with. 2:1, 5:1, 20:1? Or any other insights you may have. This is a healthcare environment, so a large portion of our guests are transitory, but while they’re here we want a good experience. 
 Thoughts? Totally to open to suggestions. 
 Edit: sorry for spelling, grammar. Mobile sucks. :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 Earlier this year I shared an OpenSSL cheat sheet and it seems to have been received well by this community. I've made a few typo corrections and wanted to share the latest version.
 ==> OpenSSL Cheat Sheet v1.7 Direct Download <==
 The cheat sheet includes these commands and various flags/arguments and notes for how to use them:
  
openssl rsa
 openssl genrsa
 openssl dsa
 openssl gendsa
 openssl dsaparam
 openssl ec
 openssl ecparam
 openssl pkey
 openssl genpkey
 openssl x509
 openssl req
 openssl pkcs12
  
The most up to date version of this cheat sheet will always be available at pracnet.net/openssl, at the moment that is v1.7, so feel free to use the direct download link above. (no registration or e-mail sign ups required)
 The cheat sheet is a part of a course I teach on OpenSSL, and if you use OpenSSL for troubleshooting and inspecting SSL/TLS, you might want to consider the whole course. Since it's coming up on sale season I figured I'd also throw in 1000 free seats to the course on Udemy:

We now have to begin expanding our email retention and archiving requirements. Google has Vault with unlimited space and retrieval options for an add on. I've read pros/cons using Vault, compared to another 3rd party service, especially in how it performs and for lack of some features. It seems so much easier to get Vault and administer from the same "Dashboard" though rather than another service pooling all our email and using a side vendor. I was hoping follow members, either uses a service that works with Gmail very well, or their direct Vault product and what their take is on it. Thank you for your help!

 it is some kind of a theoretical unequal-cost load-balancing question.
 Let's imagine that we have two parallel connections between two routers 400M and 700M, or any unequal M:N ratio.
 What we have now for load both connections M:N ratio (let's forget about Mice and Elephant flows).
 E.g. if we have Cisco from both sides - we have an proprietary EIGRP for this, which does an excellent job with this.
 So question - what if we have two different vendors on different sides (or one non-Cisco)? 
 What options do we have? BGP + DMZ Bandwidth Community? Static M:N routes? Do we have another non-Cisco proprietary solution for this?
 Is there anything else?
 I will be glad for detailed answers with explanations, Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good afternoon,
 I work Helpdesk for a printer company and had an interesting situation that seems to be network related.
 The printer had a static IP, .0.24. I enabled DHCP, rebooted and it grabbed a 0.250 address (no APIPA). Also confirmed they were on the same Wi-Fi as the computer. The IP would not respond to pings and the UI was not reachable but the IP could be seen in an arp -a command. The MAC matched the printer. Typically, if you cannot ping it’s either on a different network or offline completely, and with this being visible in arp, a good Wi-Fi connection status and the printer rebooted, the only thing I could think would be to reboot the router. Any thoughts on what could cause this?
 Thanks very much!

I don’t ask people for free haircuts or to come clean my house for free. Why do they think they can just call or text me with their IT problem and expect me to give them an answer? I paid money and spent a lot of time to get my certs and education. My solution to this has been to tell people, “sure, I can take a look at that. My diagnosis fee is $50. I can’t guarantee I can fix it but I will take a look and we can go from there.” I actually just got my first client like this. It was meant as more of a deterrent but I got a client. Lol. Sorry for the rant. Just wanted to see what others think.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I'm a SrNE for a global biotech company and we've been running approximately ~2k+ C9300s spanning the globe for a few years now. Over the last 3 months we've been experiencing complete failures at a very alarming rate. We're currently running IOS-XE v17.3.5.
 Switch failures have occurred for various reasons, entailing:
 - PoE capability of switch death (Non PSU related).
 - Switches experiencing faulty boot flash requiring more RMAs.
 - Switches randomly bricking with no lights whatsoever. Just a complete and total death.
 - Switches randomly bricking and giving "BOOT FAIL W" error on console and non-recoverable. Can't even access ROMMON. Validated via Cisco bugID CSCwb57624, but not recoverable via power cycle/reload as noted in Workaround: https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwb57624
 Further, after our team pushed Cisco to how unacceptable this has been, they came back acknowledging a potentially faulty batch of many of our C9300s with corrupted DIMM.
 Guys... In my 15+ years of networking and having managed C3750/3850s for the majority of my career, I've never experienced or witnessed anything like this from Cisco.
 For years now, I haven't been fond of the direction Cisco has taken their Catalyst platform with moves like axing Catalyst IOS, consolidating IOS-XE to catalyst hardware, and their continued merakification of Catalyst which lacks the tight integration needed for rock-solid stability (IMO). 
 Cisco's moves have mostly felt more like cost-cutting measures than anything truly beneficial or innovative from an engineering standpoint. It's all giving me FirePower vibes which is why Palo is now dominating that market-space.
 Anyone else running C9300s in their environment at scale?
 Any failures?
 What software chain?
 I can't imagine our org is the only one experiencing this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are currently using a NAC product that's pretty expensive. We are using it to dynamic tag VLANs based on Active Directory OU. So, if the user is in the "Monkeys" OU they get assigned to the "Monkeys" VLAN.
 Can this be done with something like NPS or FreeRadius? I've been checking documentation and I'm getting mixed signals on how easy this would be to configure with FreeRadius (seems like it doesn't play well with AD, requires Samba, etc.) and I have no experience with NPS, but the documentation seems pretty straightforward.
 Any recommendations on how to dynamically wireless users to specific VLANs via AD group/OU without paying out the ass for a NAC?

They continue on (in the ticket) to say that they have already requested access to this site, months ago, and nobody helped them. In today's ticket, they did not include the domain they needed access to.
 I looked at the ticket history and sure enough, they did submit a ticket months ago. That ticket did include a domain and at that time the tech notes on the ticket were.
  
The domain resolves and opens on a few computers that I've confirmed access on. Please confirm that you've typed the domain name/website name properly. I am keeping the ticket open for a few days, please let me know when you are available to perform further testing from your machine/location.
  
The status on the ticket was changed to 'waiting for user response', which keeps the ticket open and informs the user at least once a day that a ticket requires their attention. It does this for 5 business days then closes the ticket if there is no reply from the user or if the tech doesn't modify the ticket in some other way.
 The user ignored the notes from the first ticket that 'they put in months ago' and I'm sure this user is bad mouthing IT. 'I can't get to this site, this is dumb, I already put in a ticket, they never help me!!!'

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Quick background first - Got about 10 years of professional networking experience but I have NEVER touched proper enterprise grade cisco equipment. EVER. Mostly worked in places that couldn't afford or didn't need all those features and a new ISP that did a Juniper/Calix combo. FINALLY started working for an employer that has the scratch for Cisco with Palo Alto for Firewall.
 TL;DR: I'm very green on what Cisco hardware can and cannot do.
 We are getting tasked with stopping users from being able to communicate directly with each other within their same subnets. They only need to communicate with specific servers and cloud services.
 With Calix, I was able to use a protocol called Mac Forced Forwarding (MFF). In conjunction with DHCP Snooping and IP Source Verification, the switches forced all traffic to the gateway where a host was assigned via DHCP. My original thought was to use this and have the PaloAlto's regulate this traffic. Well to my surprise, these catalyst switches (9200, 9300 and 2960) do not have this feature. Seems to be limited to ISP grade switches.
 I tried using Switchport Protection (Private VLAN Edge) and this worked when the workstation where on the same switch. But it allows me to communicate to other workstations on other switches. While all of my access switches do trunk back 1-to-1 to the core switches. If I put those switch's uplinks into protected status as well, I might get what I need. Still "testing" this out. 
 I'm also looking at VACLs but I haven't fully grasped the cisco mapping features yet.
 Can anyone give me some suggestions on how to tackle this requirement?

 Setup
 Firewall >> 1820-8g >> WiFi AP
 My WiFi AP has 2 SSID (VLAN 1 and VLAN 1003). All I want to do is be able to pass through both on one port to firewall but all tagged traffic is currently blocked.
 I think what I need to do is set all ports as Untagged for VLAN ID 1 and Tagged for VLAN ID 1003? This seems weird since I don't want to "tag" incoming traffic I just want it to pass through if already tagged. Is my understanding correct or should both VLAN ID be shown as Tagged?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have inherited a network where we have a single peering with an ISP using a private AS on our side. We advertise a single prefix (which we own) to them which they then advertise to the internet on our behalf.
 In RIPE, there is an empty ROA configuration where it shows the current AS numbers advertising the prefix (i.e. the ISPs AS) and we can just pick one and click to create an ROA to match. Private AS numbers do not show up here and cannot be configured as origins.
 I recently added an ROA to try and reduce the risk of a BGP hijack of our prefix. Shortly after creating the ROA, the ISP stopped accepting our prefix and of course it dropped off the internet. The ISP wasn't able to give much information as to why this happened but by removing the ROA, it came back up soon after.
 I'm assuming what happened is, the ISP had a filter on their router which looked up the ROA for our advertised prefix, saw it originating from a private AS which didn't match the ROA and then dropped it. Would that be normal behavior for an ISP? Would they not trust the private AS as they were the ones who provided it to us in the first place?
 Or is using an ROA just not possible where the originating AS is a private one?
 We do have a public AS that was recently assigned but have not started using it just yet.

Is there a reasoning for this rather than just including the ISP gateway in the provided public IPs? We usually have a firewall at the edge but when provided with this ISP set up, we have to use a router to bridge the WAN and LAN. Just wondering if there is any reason behind this configuration?

 I'm a software engineer who came from a non software background and am in that "holy shit, computers and the internet are amazing, let's understand how the world works phase." I work for an awesome company that has networking problems and even though I don't work on that part, I do want to understand it thoroughly.
 Anyways, I am looking a for a book that's basically self contained/will give me enough information that I can read it and say "ok, I know how this works and can sort of make a mental model of it in my head." I tend to read books cover to cover/work through as many problems as I can along the way.Ideally I'll only need one book.
 Current recommendations/on my list are
 - Comer, Internetworking
 - Tannenbaum's Networking textbook - Networking a top down approach
 Thanks in advance for your advice

 example.com is the public domain, ad.example.com is the internal-only domain. Lookups to records under ad.example.com will succeed against the internal Samba domain controllers will succeed but will fail against public DNS servers.
 As we can see, a lookup for rt.example.com returns the CNAME, but then doesn't "follow up" to get the IP address, even though a lookup for rt73a.ad.example.com returns the IP address.
 The context is that I currently don't want rt.example.com to be accessible over the internet but I might want that in future. Was hoping to be able to that without requiring a change of URL used to access it.
 Is DNS supposed to behave how it's behaving for me, or is there some setting I need to change to get the behaviour I want?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are replacing the old DCs in our organisation for cyber security which has made us create new print servers. All the printers are installed and work from the servers in the configuration we want, using dns for port names etc.
 Now because of print nightmare we are trying a work around to install the printer drivers via intune and then a login script to map the printers after the drivers are installed.
 Here comes the issue, we have noticed that all of the printers with v4 drivers are being installed with MS point and print driver. The printer with v3 drivers are installing with their appropriate drivers.
 We have found that some of the V4 drivers are not installing, so adding that to the driver install script, removing and re-running the login mapping script, it still adds the printers with point and print. 2 of these are for the main office and need user preferences enabled so they can select trays etc. But point and print doesn't enable that. Without that we cannot shut off the old DCs.
 Now we don't want to disable the print nightmare registry key or amend it to a state where it is not 1 as this will be picked up in the cyber security audit in March 2023. I am at a loss as to what I can do to bypass this issue. It seems odd that all websites on the Internet state V4 is the answer to fixing it but V4 is causing the problem.
 At the moment we cannot move to a driverless system as we need to get new printer contracts first.
 TLDR; printers with V4 drivers are shown installed with point and print and is not suitable for our environment.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am in IT for a Navy Organization and we currently use AppLocker in our environment. AppLocker is set to block anything to do with OneDrive, however it keeps getting reinstalled during every monthly patch. As far as I know, its not a requirement for any other apps and we have already been blocking it for a few month. 
 What this ends up doing is making is users constantly see "blocked by admin" and error messages. This does not effect functionality but it causes an uproar from users.
 My suggested solution is to disable OneDrive usage via Group policy but actually "allow OneDrive" via AppLocker to prevent these messages. 
 Is there anything Security/STIG related that makes my idea sound like a bad one? For reference this is the policy I want to enable.
 https://admx.help/?Category=Windows_10_2016&Policy=Microsoft.Policies.OneDrive::PreventOnedriveFileSync
 Any and all input would be great regarding your organization, file storage, or just security guidelines in general. I do have the OneDrive V2R2 STIGS as well. But I wasn't sure if there are any other overarching guidelines I am missing out on.

 Was wondering if anyone on this forum could shed a light on a strange issue I'm seeing on a network. 
 I have a VRF (all configured correctly as reachability to other subnet across the MPLS are reachable fine) presented on a port facing a host (windows laptop) the IP facing this host is:
 192.168.0.1/24 
 The host laptop is on:
 192.168.0.2/24
 I can ping the laptop fine sourcing the gateway interface on the router and the host can ping the gateway, however it is unable to ping other hosts inside the VRF on other sites (the laptop can ping the gateway to these other sites just nothing sat behind the gateway). 
 To remove any possibility of it being an MPLS issue I created a loopback interface on the router where the above 192.168.0.0/24 subnet sits: 
 Loopback100
 10.10.10.10/32 
 I still cannot ping the host 192.168.0.5 sourcing this loopback. I instantly assumed the host default gateway was wrong as I could ping directly connected but no further, however the hosts address/subnet mask and default gateway are 100% correct.
 ​
 Was wondering if anyone had a similar issue, the router is question is a Cisco ISR 1100.

 I have tried running various powershell commands to uninstall then reinstall appx packages, copying over the SystemApps folder from a working server, deleting the shell experience folder from appdata for all users, exporting appx registry keys from a working server, and deleting and recreating profiles.

 I'm not versed in the ways of the sysadmin but i have to work with daily users fixing little and larger stuff (Helpdesk).
 I like my job but i don't know what to do anymore for a specific individual. 
 This person is paranoid, delusional and thinks the entire world is following her and changing stuff behind her back.
 It started years ago, she claimed her skype account got hacked multiple times, she couldn't reset the password since she never got the reset mails.
 Turns out her recovery address was a gmail address and she never cleaned that up so the mailbox was full.
 She doesn't want to clean it up so she can never reset any service she claims has been blocked or hacked that is connected to her gmail address.
 This person does not accept nor want to hear any rational explanation.
 She claims all her phones, laptops (private and work) are being monitored and things "change" the next time she logs on to any device.
 For years we ran scans with antivirus, antimalwares etc ... nothing is ever found except some harmless cookies.
 We can never verify if anything she claims is true since the "present situation" cannot be compared to the "previous situation" since all files are always locally on her laptop or at home or anywhere else where we have no backups.
 Finally we got her to place some documents on our internal network drives with the specific question to only follow what happens to these files while she works on them. (She really didn't want to put them on the network) This way at least i can look into the backups to see what has changed. But even that doesn't prove anything.
 What would you do so you could "prove" that either she changed something or at least see what changed and by whom ?
 This person can tie you up for hours and days complaining we don't do enough to find the culprit on her work pc and i don't know anymore what i could do to help her.

 Further to my post about using Azure/365 non licensed users. I am wondering if there is also a 3rd party provider that can link to various identity providers to be the single source of identity so we can then point SSO/Saml config from the various saas provders instead of azure.
 A comment has been made, that they want to keep out tenant as clean as possible, eg only users with licenses and have access to company resources and equipment to reduce risk. This will likely be 300 users in next few years. But overall staff could be 5000+. Of the 5000+ , they wont have email acct, nor equipment but do need access to like HR Saas portals etc.
 Personally, I think its going to be cheaper to just give everyone a basic 365 license that inc some form of email and can control the MFA part of the identity provider. But business wants alternatives as they know as soon as I enable email, I will be going, headocount, headcount (not that I said I can turn the email part off).
 I am thinking like of Okta etc but wanted ot ask here first.

 There's only a few concerns/requirements I'm looking for.
  
Pre-windows login auth to domain servers for new user authentication
 Saved credentials that can be used with said pre-windows login
 And multiple gateway options for fail over to redundant ISPs
  
For requirement #1,2 we have a few branch offices with a decent amount of turn over so new users are always signing in and out of the domain'd pc so a saved set of VPN credentials that user's can't see and don't need to be reentered for an employee to authenticate to the DC to is a must
 We currently use Watchguard fireboxes with IPsec clients as they allow prelogin auth with saved creditials, but my only gripe is that the VPN client doesn't allow for multiple gateway options with out making a new profile, that users have to swap to and sign in again on. (The VPN client has to swap gateways on its own as I don't trust my users to toggle to the back up, and to toggle back to the primary when connection is stable again.) 
 I'm hesitant at the Cisco option as I don't have much Cisco CLI expertise.
 We have about 25-35 VPN endpoints at any given time. 
 We are a full windows org and only IT uses VPN on phones (mainly to just test if the VPN connection is working)

 I have found that i need to identify and exclude any onedrive shortcuts in all users onedrives as well as:
 1 prevent them being moved via robocopy (we are lifting and shifting all onedrive content into a "documents" folder for each user)
 2 prevent any files being moved from users homedrives going in to any onedrive shortcuts folders, this is to prevent personal files being uploaded to SP or a Teams SP site. (Happened in testing...)
 Currently I have a robocopy to do a move (it's more complex than this example) :
 Onedrive root -> Onedrive\Documents Hdrive -> onedrive\Documents
 Issue being folders are merged and onedrive shortcuts will upload content to whatever sites they are part of.
 This is a task set out as we can not use the provided onedrive migration tools due to some clash with known folder redirection and pther issues that i wasnt part of initially. 
 Any ideas? Or am I over complicating things.
 I have created a complicated powershell script so far that does alot of prechecks (network,diskspace,homedrive space required, etc) but this actual lift and shift part just gets more complicated when I look into the nitty grity bits.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, i’m an italian IT admin for some different companies, i started my business 1 year ago and i have 5 year of experience in the IT administration field (i started almost from zero and during my engineer graduation i worked a lot in this field). Since i’m relying on Aruba to host my customer websites and email server (talking about imap/pop ofc), i would like to move to a vps to increase the income and to simplify my management work. I started looking at OVH but i need a “lot” of storage because my customers want a lot of GB per email address and on OVH to obtain more than 160gb i need to pay for the 8core/8gb ram vps that i don’t need (i can’t consider the option to add a secondary partition because cpanel can’t officially store email on another partition). So i started looking at A2Hosting, the “Lift 16 Vps” makes more sense for me since it has 450gb storage so i can fulfill the customer needings about email capacity. The exchange server is not a viable option due to costs. I would like to hear opinions about a2hosting, if someone has better ideas than mine and if cpanel has some sort of problems on multi-hosting that i didn’t consider. Thanks in advice

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey!
 I am working as an MSP for Small Businesses (<10 employees). None of our Customers have Services that are available through port forwarding nor do they use VPN connections. They have a proper professional Endpoint Security Solution (with Firewall) installed on every device.
 Now to my question: Does it make sense to deploy a "Next-Gen Firewall" into their network? I don't really see any benefit they would get out of an expensive Firewall compared to say a small MikroTik Router doing NAT (properly configured of course, VLANS etc.) . I heard that all those fancy things like Deep Packet inspection come with their own Downsides that i would rather not deal with. (And my Endpoint Security Solution supposedly does the same thing but right on every device with little to no configuration)
 Do you think the added Security weighs out the cost of buying, monitoring and maintaining a Firewall for such a business?
 I personally would think the money is better spent on awareness trainings for the employees than on such a device. 
 What are your thoughts?

 I created a policy which is called Print Nightmare, but it did not work and I needed to seach it by myself. 
 Other problem that happened is that if I installed the printer first in one user the error 0x000002e4 comes up, but if I login with Admin and install it, and then login with the user and install it, there is no error. 
 Is anyway that I can install in the server and automaticly the printer shows up by itself ? 
 I do not know if I explained it well.

 I want to test my Samsung SATA drives since some of them cause trouble when recording large video files over time, causing drop frames. Seems to be due to the SSD not being able to keep up the pace. I know the usual suspects like Samsung Macigian, Crystal Disk, Smartmontools, etc. 
 But it seems none of them gives me a comfortable way of dealing with slowly degrading disks of different types and vendors. Do I really have to go into the specific SMART attributes and check on the significance of each one of them, also having to monitor them changing over time? 
 For ex. my not so good old 840 Pro (256GB) passes all tests and currently gives me 56 CRC errors and 5216 wear leveling count. I also suspect that any kind of bad sector checks also don't really work with SSDs as they trim the bad cells away!?

 If not then does anyone have any suggestions how to identify the traffic across a multi vender OS estate? I would've considered a GPO to tag it with the correct tag if it was an all Windows estate but since MAC and Android are involved to, I was hoping Teams already pre tagged in traffic.
 We use Meraki MR46 access points and there is no option to build a custom rule based on source ip address annoyingly to as I know Teams has a predefined source port range it uses across the board

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm looking at implementing wireless QOS across our wireless estate.
 With this mainly comes the need to prioritise Microsoft Teams traffic over anything else first and foremost.
 I have read a few Meraki and 3rd party posts/blogs on setting it up with no real answer to this question...
 Do the default rules (or custom ones for that matter) shape traffic themselves on the AP's or are they only a means of tagging certain traffic with the correct QoS tag?
 The reason I think the AP's might arrange traffic and shape it themselves is because the option to "Shape this traffic" is there on the default and custom rules to.
 I haven't really been able to find an answer to this.
 Our link speed bandwidth across this new site we are building is more than enough! But since there are going to be a lot of people wirelessly "hot desking", wireless will be even more prioritised than wired. With that comes a need to make sure all the AP's prioritise traffic such as Teams (mainly) etc... over others like YouTube etc... 
 If the default rules do shape traffic on the AP's into low/high priority queues behind the scenes then they will be enough for what I'm looking for here given that the default tags from Meraki seem to be correct across the board for things like VOIP and Teams etc...

Usually we test circuits and such with iperf, but I was thinking it may be useful to setup a html5 speed test server on each of our datacenters that users and clients could be directed to with a url link. Opera would still be used for when we need to test isolated links. But for initial testing, it would be much easier than walking clients through iperf. 
 This isn't something I want internet facing or anything, just for internal testing to our datacenters. 
 Has any one set something up like this in an enterprise setting? I see open speed test as an open source solution. But curious about potential security concerns because we would have to get it past security obviously. 
 Just looking to see if others have done something like this and what recommendations people may have.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Anyone else or just me? The amount of trouble and drama that these cause me is unreal at times. Absolutely hate the things!
 In an environment where your place cannot ship goods without the printed labels, it is a bit of a showstopper!
 We use Zebra printers at site, quite a number of them, printing various labels from SAP, so they often have to be specific printers for each label type. These are types such as 110Xi4's, 220Xi4's, ZD500's and ZT610's. 
 A long while back, I made some suggestions around purchasing maintenance for them but this cost and idea wasn't being entertained. So at the time, looked at purchase a spare of each printer type so in the event of failure, we can roll out a new printer immediately, minimising disruption and downtime. We went with this idea and knowing it could be months before replacement printer would arrive as lead times are about 3 months now. Obviously this was long ago now and spare is in use. 
 So today, printer seems to have a mechanical fault, is out of warranty and Zebra don't really want to know. I'd sent them a video displaying fault and they now recognise it as being mechanical fault and needs a visit, but they ask me to contact a partner for this!
 Being the only IT guy about the place, this ultimately falls to me. I'm an IT guy yes, but I am not a printer engineer. We have our limits but it doesn't half stress me out when these things go down.
 It honestly felt as though I was doing same thing over and over again with the printer and expecting a different result. I also find printers the most mundane sort of things to be dealing with which I suppose doesn't help!

My HR Dept is tasking me with reaching out to the termed employee and coordinating the return of equipment. I dont feel like it should be IT's responsibility. I do believe that I should provide the list of equipment but not be the means of recovering it. I am curious on everyone's thoughts and what procedures you all might have in place for this.
 Edit: I would like to thank everyone for your feedback. A little more background here, small IT Dept, I am a lone Sysadmin with one tech support rep. We have a company of about 225 employees and I report directly to the COO. I posted here because I keep getting put in situations of having to deal first hand with termed employees. And of recent I was put in a situation to meet up with a termed employee at our offices on a Saturday when no one is there. I have drawn the line here and documented my concerns in an email to HR and management. Thanks for the reassurance that I am making the right decision here stepping up to management.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for an MSP and I am fairly new to my role. I have a head on my shoulders to not do something like this.
 A client has a server that was setup about a year ago. I was working on the server recently to install a TPM chip to have BitLocker setup and come to my surprise; I didn't see a RAID controller; and then I went into Disk Management and confirmed my suspicion. 
 Disk 1: 500 GB: for OS
 Disk 2: 2TB (Spanned) for DATA Drive
 Disk 3: 2TB (Spanned) for DATA Drive
 Disk 4: 2TB (Spanned) for DATA Drive
 Disk 5: 2TB Unused (Empty) 
 https://imgur.com/a/Y46NSS7
 Server is PowerEdge R540 128 GB Memory / Intel(R) Xeon(R) Silver 4214 CPU @ 2.20GHz 
 Client has about 7 VMs being ran on this span of 3 hard drives. Fortunately all together the total amount of data being used is just a bit over 1 TB and we have Offsite backups running. Client doesn't know this yet. 
 I want to look into getting a hard RAID Controller for the server and get RAID setup. Should I go for a RAID 5 and move the DATA off the D: Drive to the unused Disk on DISK 5? Or setup the server to do have a RAID 10 configuration for the DATA Drive?
 Also it bothers me that the OS is just sitting on a single drive with no redundancy as well. I was thinking of doing a RAID 1 for that.
 How would you go through and handle this issue and prevent as minimum downtime as possible to get this s*** fixed?

 I am using an old switch to practice a few things on first, so that I dont screw up production.
 So with that said, I pulled an old Dell N2024P switch out of the closet, flashed the latest firmware, and did the following which seems to have worked in terms of setting up a management VLAN. What I did:
  
Add VLAN 10 called "Mgmt"
 Assigned IP address 10.11.10.6 /24 to the VLAN 10 interface.
 Removed the IP address from the default VLAN 1 interface
 Marked ports 1-23 untagged VLAN 1, marked port 24 untagged VLAN 10.
  
So with that, I now can only access the management interface for the switch by plugging into port 24 and assigning a 10.11.10.X /24 IP to my network adapter. Great, this is fun…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m predicting that with the timing of this year’s World Cup, it will become a huge fad(here in the US) that will explode over the Thanksgiving break and just about everyone will have at least one game streaming during peak network time, won’t be surprised if there are some who have the PC, Phone & Tablet going at the same time. Obviously NBAR and some traffic shaping would be an easy fix but I’m convinced our company leadership has compromising photos of our department head and when the higher ups complain about the quality of their video stream, he will pass the problem onto us to implement some sort of solution.
 Currently our internet link utilization averages around 75-80% and we just use QoS to ensure critical traffic is guaranteed bandwidth when there is congestion. Increasing the capacity of our pipe isn’t an option and we’ve tried for years to alter our network acceptable use policy(people LOVE to buy switches on amazon and plug it into both wall jacks in their office). 
 Any recommendation regarding how I can manage this upcoming problem? I’m assuming that we’re not the only team with this issue particularly South Americans who also have to deal with the time difference and beloved sporting event happening during work hours.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would love to throw myself into say a 6-month contract, fully commit to it, do the best job I can, learn as much as I can, save up as much as I can. And then when it's finished take 2-3 months off to travel and such. Rinse and repeat.
 Is this viable? Or would it be seen in a negative light by employers, having all these "career breaks"? The way some people make it sound is if there is a 1-month gap in your resume, questions start being asked. 
 I appreciate any feedback! I feel like I need a change from the normal work lifestyle of indefinite mon-fri 10 hour days for the next 30 years until I retire. Contracting seems like it could be a good way to keep things fresh, experience different infrastructures and learn new skills. And generally seems to be better pay, I'd likely earn the same if not more even with the time off.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 One of the company I work for would like to test some chassis before deployment. They can recover some parts from a partner venture (ISP) before purchase a batch of those.
 Initial config would go as follow:
 ASR-9006-AC-V2 (2 fans, 3 pwrs both V2)
 2x A9K-RSP880-LT-SE
 2x A9K-8X100GE-SE
 Beside common BGP, OSPF they need to be capable of :
  
Multicast Routing Protocols (PIM, IGMP)
 Security package (SSH, SSL)
 SSO-NSF, FHRP, LACP, BFD
 MPLS (Traffic Engineering, Layer 3 VPN including VRFs, RSVP, EVCs, Layer2VPN, EVPN)
  
For what I can read online, I don't understand what difference is between A9K-RSP880-LT-SE and A9K-RSP880-SE is there any limitation to the LT version?
 Also I can read that we would need to buy some licensing for VRF which is this A9K-800G-AIP-SE.
 Is there anything else that would be required in order to make this work?
 Obviously I could go and ask Cisco but I already know I would only receive a explainer with a BOM for ASR99XX which we are not interested in currently.
 If anyone is an expert, I would glady listen to advice.
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm hoping for some guidance here in regard to a wireless implementation. Side Note: I'm fairly new to wireless.
 The implementation is across two physical Locations where one is a giant freezer and the other is an Ambient Warehouse. The AP's in each area are in their own AP Group and Flexconnect Group. 
 The issue right now is when handheld devices are in the Freezer they have no signal.
 From what I can tell when testing signal on site. My laptop stays connected to the Ambient Warehouse when inside the Freezer. All the strongest signals I see when standing in the freezer are from the Ambient Warehouse AP's and very bad signal from some of the AP's in the Freezer.
 The AP's in each area are different models. C9115AXI-E and AIR-CAP1532E-A-K9. A 3rd party designed and configured this solution, and I am lining them up for a troubleshooting session.
 ​
 Has anyone got any recommendation on what I need to be looking at?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, first post on here but I have utilized this subs info for quite some time.
 To paint the general picture. I recently started a new position and found myself needing to assign some of our available static IPs for new security cameras that were being installed. This led me to the IP spreadsheet that the company utilizes. I know that this is not uncommon, but I have never encountered one so inaccurate/outdated. A few basic NMAP scans showed just how bad it is.. but not to derail, I got approval to begin purging and updating the spreadsheets.
 My current process (only testing atm, I have not begun updating the spreadsheet) is an NMAP scan: nmap -sn -PR and: nmap -sn -PS. I also run a scan through the IP Address Management tool in the Solarwinds toolkit that the company utilizes. Finally, I will ping the IP from the local switch itself (if applicable).
 I know this technique is redundant and most likely not the most effective method. Thus, before I begin, I was hoping to gather any suggestions or techniques that others may use to ensure that an IP address is not in use.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is an FYI post. For the last 2-3 weeks we have been having intermittent flapping of connectivity within our Meraki AutoVPN network. We have 4 offices in a mesh topology. The event logs on our MX firewall would show entries for 'VPN Tunnel Connectivity Change' and 'connectivity: false' while specifying the peer losing connectivity. It seemed to happen on the hour, and last about 5 minutes. Ping attempts during that time would timeout between offices. However, normal internet access was not affected - only the VPN tunnels. So what was the cause? After working with a couple of engineers at Meraki support, some suggested firmware upgrades and rollbacks (to no avail), we requested an escalation of the issue. After some analysis on their end, they discovered that the VPN Registry servers we were using were very busy. They changed our primary and secondary VPN registry servers. Since then, no more issues. Hoping this post will save someone some time in the future.

So, everything is saying I will find a redirect to a redirect xml. I am seeing a list of words with the names of the discovery items and 0 as the dword value. The list contains autodiscover-s.outlook.com, and our owa, which isn't reachable at the time. This is the first time I have seen -s. My DNS is a CName: Audotdiscover that leads to autodiscover.outlook.com. 
 How do I change these settings globally? Should I change this? Is this even a problem? Do you have additional resources/information? I know OWA is unreachable, and that might be causing some of this problem. 
 Thank you for any information you can help with.

 AIR-CT5520-K9
 Mix of Cisco 3800/9120 APs.
 I was looking at the WLC and saw a few potential settings to modify to improve client connectivity. The building itself has a pretty good density of APs (over 90) and we do not want to or think adding more is the correct solution to fighting concrete everywhere.
  
Want to change client roaming aggressiveness under Wireless ----> 802.11a/n/ac/ax to a minimum RRSI threshold of -80.
 Changing RF profiles specifically for this building.
  
Any thoughts or tips you guys have used in the past for this type of environment?

 We have all Dells and some desperately needed updates, this script does that and even changes the bios password if a existing one is already applied. Obviously this can all be changed to fit your needs.
 The regkey adds and take aways in the scripts are because that how we know if something is install or found in intune.
 This also takes away Dell bloatware. All in all im proud of it, took a while to fine tune it but it can always be improved. Just thought Id share.
 There is a Install, Uninstall, and detection script so it wont install on machines that arent Dells.

 We are trying to use the command prompt net group from a local login on a workstation.. This workstation is on the domain, but I'm logging in as the local user: .\localuser and not the domain\user.
 Command prompt code below: net group MYDOMAINGROUP /domain
 I can't get the command prompt above to run on the .\localuser, but I can get it to run on the Domain\User. How can I get this to work on the .\localuser?
 The image below is a screenshot and results from the command prompt. The left command prompt is run as a domain user. the command prompt on the right is run as a local user. The local user is getting an System error 5 occurred Access is denied.. Does anyone know of any group policy objects or ways to get a local user to successfully request information from the domain controller? example

 This application consists of a database which resides on a Win 2019 Std server with an associated service which facilitates client's access to said database. Users have a client application which is installed on their Win 10 Pro machines which is used to access the database residing on the server.
 Both the server-side application and the client-side application would need to be isolated.
 Does anyone know of a solution I could use to facilitate this?

Now, it seems, in the corporate space, due to the appeal of Microsoft's vast product suite, most companies have moved or will be moving to Microsoft 365. Question: Is this setup healthy? This might be exaggeration, but in years to come, since all data will be housed and managed by one company (Microsoft), will we even need the SMTP protocol?

 And also another question about this. What other IP spaces are there? I know about 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12 and 192.168.0.0/16. But I also know that there are spaces like 0.0.0.0/0 and 255.x.x.x/x.

Their main SSL certificate expired 4 days ago. Tried to create an account to reduce the amount of captchas to fill for unblocking while handling a range of IPs that seems to have gotten a few IPs blacklisted there for some reason, the confirmation email required to activate the account never arrives (which makes sense if they use the certificate on their SMTP, providers would likely reject email from a server with an expired cert). And when using their contact form to let them know i get the very helpful response of:
  
An Error Occurred!
 Error:
  
And nothing else. 
 So, if anyone has an alternative way to nudge those people to go and fix their SSL, please do so. In the meanwhile i guess it's captchas time...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On all our administrative GUIs (VMware vCenter, Storage Systems, Back-up solutions, SAN management, iDRACs, Container Environment), we configure AD authentication together with basic (local) authentication. This basic authentication is used as a 'workaround' in case AD would be unaccessible, or someone messes up the AD binding, or makes a change on AD level.
 While there are already cases where we had to use the local user, it poses a huge security risk since these are static credentials and there is no policy in place to rotate them. 
 How do you guys approach this? I'm aware Microsoft doesn't recommend password rotation anymore and instead advices to use MFA together with long/complex passwords. I assume this is not possible with basic authentication? Would you disable basic authentication completely? What happened where you than were lock-out because of an underlying AD issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've just wasted an entire morning understanding why a static source directory was apparently changing files, only to realise Robocopy may be reporting the summary wrong.
 Each time I run a threaded command like...
 robocopy \\source\folder \\destination\folder /MIR /MT:32 /Z 
 ... on the same location I get a summary report each time with differing file counts and sizes.

 ​
 But running it standard (without the threaded switch)...
 robocopy \\source\folder \\destination\folder /MIR /Z 
 ...I get the same, correct result every time.
 ​
 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ Total Copied Skipped Mismatch FAILED Extras Dirs : 547 0 547 0 0 0 Files : 1370293 0 1370293 0 0 0 Bytes : 707.611 g 0 707.611 g 0 0 0 Times : 0:08:38 0:00:00 0:00:00 0:08:38 
 The threaded command copies the files fine (when I check manually), but I need to prove the results after and the summary suggests an incomplete copy.
 The threaded command is wicked fast compared to the normal way, but I'm having to run a slow /L after the fact just to prove the file counts match.
 ​
 Has anyone else experienced this? Am I just doing something wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to push multicast across a network and am unsure of myself. I have some Sr people to ask but I was hoping I might find some advice here too. I am peering with my RP via bgp on the edge of my network, a direct connect, that router is configured to accept multicast now but due to an oddity I have a switch next. So it is foreign RP, router, switch1, firewall, switch2, multicast clients.
 For the switch1 how would you all handle it? Would you turn on layer 3 and route multicast between the router and firewall or just extend a vlan between the two.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there anyone here who has experience using Snipe-IT that can advise on its capability for tracking a large volume of repairs and RMAs?
 For a Little context, we currently use an out dated system that was developed in house to manage movement of assets(we provide retailers with IT hardware and often install loan equipment while we repair or obtain replacement equipment for the customer). We recently won a contract to distribute specialized network switches nationally but the catch is that we now directly take over the warranties and our current system is not suitable for the now large amount of RMAs we have to process and track. I have been asked to evaluate Snipe-IT as an alternative system before we spend a small fortune developing new Asset Management Software.
 I have played around with the demo and while It will easily address most of our needs the only way I can see us using it to track assets that have come back for an RMA is by creating a new status or duplicating a location and adding a suffix (example, having "Location A" and "Location A-RMA area"). However, due to their high volume, we want to treat the faulty switches as an entirely separate beast, in order to make end of month reporting easier.

 I face an issue in my network environment, the detail is as following:
 We have 2 ISP with the IP's (example) below :
 ISP 1: 103.45.24.0/24
 ISP 2: 203.17.25.0/24
 ​
 here is our brief environment: https://ibb.co/gv36xDx
 ​
 There is requirement from my manager whether is it possible, if we have app publish to internet where if the IP public from ISP 1 (103.45.24.0/24) - dnat to - Web Server is down or fail then the IP (103.45.24.0/24) failover to ISP 2. Otherwise, if IP Public ISP 2 down or fail then the IP failover to ISP 1 ?
 ​
 I have searched and still looking for anything about BGP who explain this explicitly but still have no clue how to configure it.
 ​
 I have basic knowledge in networking and make use GNS3 for lab and prove of concept before going into production.
 ​
 If there is a paid course or anything in particular or video tutorial that i can follow.
 I would like to take and pay for it.
 ​
 Really appreciate anyone who look into this.

 ​
 We have a few hundred notebooks and (Mini-)PCs in our company, and a few months ago it seems Microsoft introduced a (or a few) very, VERY annoying bug(s) when it comes to mainly DisplayPort connected screens... things still worked pretty much without issues, so I (we) suspect a random Windows Update as the culprit by this point.
 ​
 People have called many, MANY times by now about (but not only) ...
 ... flickering displays
 ... screens that randomly turn black mid working, yet Windows still sees them as connected so it suddenly becomes a "ghost display"
 ... random colors flickering
 ... screens not waking up once it went into Standby
 ... weird resolution issues when using Display to DVI adapters
 ... and so on...
 ​
 I am... really at my end here and so is the rest of our IT team. This doesn't just happen on notebooks, this also happens on Mini- and normal full size PCs, it doesn't matter what graphics card even. This happens on Intel... NVidia... AMD... and so far this almost exclusively is happening on DisplayPort connected screens. Almost all of those displays don't have HDMI tho, or if they have most of the Docking Stations only have one HDMI out.
 So yeah, just a little rant about this...

But I've never used/managed ADFS before, nor MS Dynamics 365 CRM. I walk through MS documents, get the certs setup for ADFS and get the Relying Party Trusts working again. I get certs renewed in the 365 Deployment Manager. Updated the CRM IIS bindings.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm pretty experienced with Varnish and VCL (sysadmin 2 years), but this seems to be an uncommon case because of a couple of factors.
 I have a new hitch/varnish server running as a remote caching proxy serving a node.js backend halfway across the Internet. The backend is serving HTTP on 9801 but is also serving websockets on port 3000. A user visiting the site enters the domain https://foo.com, gets taken to the varnish box and views the site, where the site javascript then tells it to connect to websockets on wss://foo.tld:3000, but it can't connect. There are lots of solutions for setups where varnish is running on the same localhost as the backend that it's serving, but this one seems to be a problem. My VCL includes the standard req.http.upgrade -> return pipe with the connect headers copied, and it worked with our previous frontend proxy that was on a different CDN, and I suspect the old CDN was playing a part in making the websocket connections work.
 How do I get varnish to pick up the client connection for WSS on 3000 and pass it transparently back and forth to a remote backend that is running WS also on 3000? There's so many possible factors at play that I'm a bit lost. All replies appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I set up a Ubiquiti network for a client last summer: Edgerouter-X + Unifi WAPs. Flat LAN: all on 192.168.10.0/24 (all good since then).
 Now, he has some Ethernet-capable CNC machines and a monitoring device (from Chatter), and the monitoring service told him to set up VLANs. So, he asked me to set up VLANs.
 I go out, set up VLANs as follows:
  
192.168.10.0/24 -> VLAN 0 (default, original)
 192.168.20.0/24 -> VLAN 20 for CNCs
 192.168.30.0/24 -> VLAN 30 for Wifi
  
For the machines, we set static IPs since he uploads designs to the machines via FTP and he types in the IP address directly. Fine, good.
 I set the CNCs' static IPs as:
  
192.168.20.11 (later)
 192.168.20.12
  
VLAN 20 DHCP range is 192.168.20.101 to 192.168.20.200 to reserve the lower range for static IPs.

I have gone through testing all the features we require (802.1x, dhcp security, voice vlans and qos, switch stacking, etc) and it seems to check all the boxes. Mist is missing a few knobs, but we can accomplish these through CLI templates. What is everyone's recent experience, specifically around ex4400 and potentially ex4100? We use MX routers and have had very good success with these. We also have been deploying Mist wireless with good success. My main concern is code and hardware reliability.

I'm making a completely fresh AD/AAD environment for fun, trying to mirror our current hybrid environment, and want to make sure I do it as cleanly and future-proofed as possible. It's going to be my personal test environment, I'm hoping it can save me some trouble in the future since half the time there seems to be some little bug or security hardening that sneaks through unnoticed (or undocumented) for monthly patching. Plus it's a fun project in general, I always end up taking jobs where it's all set up already, never got to try making my own environment fully from scratch. So far I'm just building lots of Server 2022 VMs in Hyper-V on a spare laptop and using a free Azure account to see how far I can get, going to be a long road ahead to get everything like our work environment but hopefully will learn a lot.

 I admit I’m not the best manager I’m a systems engineer who got thrown into management. I let the get away with a lot to try and avoid conflict. One day I got fed and told them no more games, no more messing around at work, and started opening tickets up for everything. I really turned up the heat. I ended our 2 day remote policy.
 The help desk guys started dropping like flies and quit with out having another job. I’ve re-hired new help desk guys and 6 months later they are the most efficient group ever and the company is even giving them a raise due to the hard work they put in.
 I learned my lesson as a new manager. I’m so happy that everything ended up okay.

 So I pass CCNA last year in January which been sitting on collecting dust since I been focus on RHCSA which finally passed yesterday. So I realize I should look into ways on how to renew it. I think Continuing education credits would be the quickest but also going for CCNP would work as well.
 with the later however, it meant to go more in depth on networking which would be interesting. only problem why I'm a little hesitant is from a Odem book I had some time ago certain topics in the early chapter mention technology which was cisco exclusive. I mean that expected since its is Cisco lol, but reason CCNA get respect is that it try to stay as foundational as possible.
 So I want to ask anyone who made a jump to 301 to ENCORE (which I gather the most congruent pathway) just how similar are they in term of concepts. like a 20% differences, & if so are said differences more Cisco's exclusives protocols and such?
 P.S if anyone know where to find learning material which just touch the new stuff. pretty please let I know!

Now when trying to connect — all our VPN clients run macOS Ventura or Monterey — I instantly receive the following error message:
  
VPN Connection
 The L2TP-VPN server did not respond. Try reconnecting. If the problem continues, verify your settings and contact your Administrator.
  
I’ve observed the same error message on both macOS versions mentioned.
 The public IP doesn’t respond to ping — which I know doesn’t necessarily mean anything other than all the ports on the router are stealthed, which is fine from a security standpoint — although all other network resources (authentication, NAS access, internet access from the inside) are working just fine.
 The network runs on:
  
A Ubiquiti UniFi USG-PRO-4 firewall
 A Ubiquiti UniFi Switch 48 US-48-500W PoE switch
 A Ubiquiti UniFi Cloud Key Gen 2 UCK-62 controller
 A Dell PowerEdge T320 running Windows Server 2012
  
I reached out to the previous IT guy, but he’s incommunicado. Then I found some Windows Server updates pending … those’ll get installed tonight.
 Any help, even diagnosing from first steps would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good day, all! I am interested in what tools, applications or suites this community uses to monitor their IIS servers. My team would like to monitor for number of connections, system / site performance, etc, for our locally hosted server and it looks like any number of tools out there will work though there doesn't seem to be any recent information or opinions from real Sys Admins.
 And so here I am, asking this community for your thoughts, feelings, experiences with the multitude of products out there. I don't have any preferences (paid vs. open source, etc); I'm just genuinely interested in your reviews and recommendations before diving into any number of free trials and getting talked up by sales folks.
 Thanks in advance. Cheers!

As part of my bachelor's thesis I was tasked with analyzing, deploying and testing flexiWAN Open Source SD-WAN solution so I can later compare it to other SD-WAN solutions on the market. Unfortunately so far I haven't been able to find any meaningful resources regarding flexiWAN SD-WAN other than what you can find on their website, which is not much. That brings me to the question, does someone here have experience working with flexiWAN, who could point me to study resources or anything that would give me an insight into how the tech works ? Any help will be wholeheartedly appreciated :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been in my current role nearly 10 years, and to be honest for the most part I really enjoy it. They've been pretty lacking in pay raises and bonuses though, and when a former colleague set me up with an interview, I took it - my first interview in 10 years.
 It went well, and they made me an offer which is nearly 35% above my current salary. Obviously it's an incredible offer, and I'm delighted to get it. My boss says that he wants to make me a similar offer, but it's going through the quagmire of the company HR department and nothing concrete has materialised after about a week. The new company needs to know by the end of this week whether I'm accepting.
 Not counting new job fear (in which I hope I'm not alone, and everyone here has from time to time!), the big thing for me is that company policy says I'd need to be in the office at least 2 days a week. I currently do the majority of drop offs and pick ups for my little girl (who's 3), which is possible due to my WFH schedule. The commute to the new job would be about 40 minutes each way, so days that I worked, I wouldn't be able to do the nursery run.
 My new prospective boss says that in his team, he's super open to being flexible with WFH, so it may not even be this much. I'm just.... Hesitant. I know that it's because of my WFH lifestyle that I'm used to - I guess I'm just wondering, how do I get over this fear? Have any of you made a similar transition?

 Well mister, you might want to contact your auditor and state that 'indeed: we do not backup our most important financial data'. I got it al written down and escalated to my manager. I know that backups are required in this sector but the client itself apparently does not. My lord it's only wednesday and I need a drink.

 Currently have a small network with a single ISP line. We are adding another ISP with matching address space. Our address spaces are from the provider and are too small to advertise with BGP. 
 Outbound traffic seems pretty easy and lots of options with FHRP/track objects/route maps/etc but was wondering about inbound traffic. We have an authoritative DNS server being hosted on-prem. Wondering if I could add multiple glue records with each provider's address and have multiple host records to allow inbound traffic to failover.
 Also wondering the pros/cons of using VRRP vs track objects and a floating static route. Have labbed the scenario just having a floating static on the main provider tied to a track object and having the secondary provider router inject a default route into OSPF. If the primary goes down then the static will be replaced by the OSPF learned route.

We have no security posture and whenever I mention security it is treated like it’s working against the company. As with many companies security is an after thought which is then ignored. As I have a life I’ve stopped working late to support the company because I need to have a work life a balance. 
 Development of course has many people many devops engineers but there is no infosec, CTO, CIO, Tech lead or anyone of the sort.
 P.S I know quitting is a good move considering I care more about the company than the owners but I want to see if I can find a way to get a managerial promotion and if I can save this ship. I’ll probably be leaving anyways.

 From what I see, we have a black (Multi Mode?) run that runs underground into each building. From there it goes into a beige box with multiple jacks. The beige junction box then connects to a Fast Ethernet Bridge using a Fiber Patch Cable.
 I'm not sure if you can tell from the picture but I'm pretty sure I need a MultiMode SFP Module for both of my switches. Any clarification\correction on the correct module would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: How do you use REST APIs to improve your monitoring abilities?
  
With the increase of focus on DevOps has led to performing many actions and automated tasks with APIs! You can write a script that performs actions on a device or group of devices, and make intelligent decisions based on the CRUD responses. 
 What about for network monitoring? API calls to devices can obtain much of the same information, if not more detailed information than SNMP MIBs can get - but how could they be worked into an operations environment? 
 Most environments, mine included, have a number of monitoring tools. We use a combination of SolarWinds, DNA centre, Intermapper, and a few other methods. These systems poll devices every second (or several seconds) for new data. This is no different than the request/response format which would occur for API calls. 
  
 Are there tools built to utilize API calls to network devices? 
  Have any of you ever built a custom web application specifically to display their desired information in specific ways? I'm not an application or web developer by any means, so I can't speak to the complexity for a task like this, but I'm more looking into the need for something like this if there are existing commercial tools that do this already.

 In my company, we are supporting many remote office locations. A common complaint is to see that wireless or wired network speeds are slow (most engineers will be familiar with same). 
 Just wondering, what tools/apps you use to document and test network speeds in a global network environment?
 I am thinking of a way to benchmark network performance. i.e get an onsite contact to run a series of test on LAN/WLAN etc and to document the results versus what the expected results should be.
 This can then be used as the benchmark when future issues are raised to help understand if the speeds are compromised, links saturated or other IT issue etc
 Any suggestions on tools or similar processes or any thoughts in general?

 Does anyone know of a set of Visio stencils (preferably vendor-agnostic) containing pretty much all conceivable switch sizes - 8, 12, 16, and so on - with anchor points on each port? 
 I'm putting together some Visio diagrams of an existing network we'll be taking over. It's an absolute rat's nest, and we're likely going to tear it all out regardless.. but I'd like to write an as-built that encapsulates Layer 1, and review it with outgoing IT to make sure our cutover plan captures everything.
 edit: Guys, respectfully, I'm not looking for pointers on network documentation. This is a unique situation necessitating this visualization, and I'm just asking if anyone's aware of a stencil set that might help accommodate it.

 The scenario is a disaster happens at the primary site. Everybody needs to login at the secondary site. (different FW, different VPN). We disable the IPSEC tunnel and we disable the FW policies between the two sites to simulate the disaster at the primary site. Everything works and is tested.
 I was just wondering what would happen when the DC in the secondary site can't reach the DC's in the primary site and vice versa. What would happen if there are some actions to be done at the DC in the secondary site during the business continuity test, like password resets, GPO changes etc. Will the changes sync without issues to the DC's at the primary site when the connection is restored? Not planning on doing modifications though, just in case. 
 No Active Directory Sites & Services configured, I know, it's on the todo list :)

        <updated>2022-11-16T14:07:20.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning,
 I am having an issue with my native VLAN assignment for some reason and I am not sure why. I am very new to Aruba but worked with Cisco for a few years and most recently Alcatel-Lucent (unfortunately). The issue that I seem to be having is that at my branch location I have a newly deployed Aruba 6100 that sits in the IDF and connects via SM fiber back to the MDF. I have been using VLAN 100 for my native VLAN and my networking equipment all lives in that subnet. On the MDF side, I have my VLAN assignments set up like this
 BR-44-MDF> show vlan members port 1/1/49
 vlan type status
 100 default forwarding
 112 qtagged forwarding
 164 qtagged forwarding
 184 qtagged forwarding
 188 qtagged forwarding
 601 qtagged forwarding
 When I set my native VLAN on the Aruba switch trunk to match the MDF I lose connection to the switch and have to wait for the checkpoint to revert my changes back to the native VLAN being 1 before I can access the switch again. My trunk interface on the Aruba side is set up with 
 Native VLAN: 1
 Allowed VLAN List: 1,100,112,164,188
 I also noticed that the Aruba switch VLAN 1 is pulling a DHCP address in the same subnet as my VLAN 100 address which surprised me that it didn't throw an error for overlapping subnets. 
 BR-44-IDF# show ip interface brief
 Interface IP Address Interface Status
 vlan1 10.1.94.21/25up/up
 vlan100 10.1.94.125/25up/up
 I am not sure if I am missing something silly that I need to do in order to stop this behavior and have the VLAN 100 act as the native VLAN with a static IP instead of VLAN 1 with its DHCP-assigned IP. Any help in finding the piece I am missing would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have been looking into upgrading our systems from RC4 encryption to AES-256. The first time I turned it on it broke everything. DC's couldn't talk to each other at all. It was my first truly oh shit moment. Took down the company for 3 hours. Today I got sometime to go back and start looking at the issue . The password for the krbtgt account has not been reset in about 8 years. When I run the klist command it shows AES-256 connection from and to every machine I have looked at. The only exceptions is the krbtgt and our QNAP device. QNAP will be something I look at afterwards. We have an old one and are talking about replacing it the first of the year so I don't want to spend too much time there. Anyhow, my thinking is it is still using RC4 because that was the last time the account had its password reset and to move it up to AES-256 the password needs to be reset. 
 ​
 Can anyone confirm if my thinking is right?
 I've been told by multiple people that resetting the password for the krbtgt account has not caused any problems. Has anyone had any issues with this?

 We have no idea what is triggering the account lockouts. The source of the account lockouts is showing a web server we use for the website, so we were considering whether its AD-integrated web server which is causing the issue, but its also showing thousands of account lockouts originating from dozens of other assets/servers in the network. 
 We have a decent sized team looking at it but we're coming up with nothing.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I wanted to send notifications from Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows.
 I created a new azure user ie.: [Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com).
 I added this user to the group which exclude the user from any Conditional Access settings.
 I created NewSMTPBasic authentication policy (AllowBasicAuthSmtp true) and assigned it to the user
 I setup SmtpClientAuthenticationDisabled : False 
 My settings of Veeam Agent for Microsoft Windows are 
 smtp server: smtp.office365.com
 email: [Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com)
 port: 587
 SSL/TLS: Yes
 user to authenticate: [Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com)
 Password: password of [Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:Backups@domain365.onmicrosoft.com) 
 My problem is that it works only with above settings. If I want to change email address to any email like: [djwheele@domain.com](mailto:djwheele@domain.com), [anymail@domain.com](mailto:anymail@domain.com), any existing users in our domain it doesn't work. 
 Did You ever had similar issue? Can You help me to solve it? Why I can send emails only to the user who is used to authenticate on smtp.office365.com ???? 
 Thank You in advance.

 Im trying to connect a copper SFP 10G (from Mikrotik) to a stacked C9300 to a DELL switch (that also supports 10Gb) but there is no link between them. I've tried different ethernet cables but no success. I tried the same ethernet cable to connect between two regular 1G copper port and it works so nothing wrong on the cable (it is a CAT6 cable). 
 I also tried to connect the copper SFP between the stacked switches (I connected one copper SFP in one port on the master switch and one copper SFP in the slave switch and connected an ethernet cable between them) and still no success, but Im not sure if you could do these tests between stacked switches.
 Either way, I also checked if that the interfaces are not in shutdown mode or err-disabled mode.
 I configured the "service unsupported-transceiver" to see if that will change anything but no success. 
 The setup I have is a stacked 9300 (two switches) and plugged in two copper SFPs, one in the master switch and one in the slave switch that goes to a dell switch so I can form a LACP between the stacked C9300 and the dell switch.
 Appreciate any help.

 I'm currently reworking our corporation's wifi and I've got EAP-TLS working, however I want to permit only a specific group of users from our local AD.
 I've got the CA up and running and publishing certificates all around to the computers (old setup) and I've got the ruleset for EAP-TLS working with GPO on the Windows domain computers.
 My problem now is that I need to permit access only to a specific group in AD as the ruleset just points to users/domain computers so everyone with a domain computer gets access.
 Once a user who's not in the group logs on I want the authentication to fail.
 I've tried adding /users/domain computers AND /group/ as a requirement in the auth policy, but the group I added in ISE External Identity Source/groups doesn't show up in the policy. I also removed a few groups and it doesn't seem to update in the policy set or the condition library.
 Is this a known bug in ISE 3.1?
 I need the computers to log in to the wireless prior to actually logging into the computer so it can reach the DC for login, then drop out of the user is not in the specific Security Group.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Apologies if this is the wrong place to be asking this question, but it is my first time seeing this issue before thought I would try my luck here.
 We have an on-prem environment using a local domain - just a standard dc server with AD and a RDS server - User1 is already logged on to the RDS server. Then User2 comes in to start their day logs into a Windows 10 PC which is domain joined and receives "Welcome User1" in the windows login greeting and User1 is then disconnected from their RDS session and User2 has actually loaded User1's profile - desktop icons and all.
 Any ideas what may be causing this, I have tried the following:
 -Removed User1 and User2's profiles from the Windows 10 PC and then re-added only User2 back on to the device but the issue is still occurring - User 1 no longer uses the Windows 10 PC just works on the RDS.
 -Removed the Windows 10 PC from the domain and re-joined to the domain. The RDS server itself is new only a month or two old has been happening ever since the RDS server was setup I was informed.
 any further suggestions on what else we can try here? - getting close to the too much time wasted - blow away windows and reinstall and see if it happens again.

 I need to migrate a IPSEC Tunnel from a Sophos UTM to a Fortigate 200F.
 Remote Gateway is a Checkpoint Firewall. So far so good. 
 Now I face 33(!) SA's which are established on the Sophos. Let me point you a picture:
 Sophos : Site A
 Checkpoint: Site B
 ​
 Site A got following Networks:
 192.168.105.0/24
 192.168.100.0/22
 and a Host 192.168.40.100/32 
 ​
 Site B:
 10.3.0.0/24
 10.2.0.0/24
 10.1.0.0/24
 10.1.7.0/24
 10.1.4.0/24
 10.1.6.0/24
 10.1.2.0/24
 10.1.1.0/24
 10.1.8.0/24
 10.1.5.0/24
 10.1.3.0/24
 ​
 I'd love to do SNAT on Site B, but I've never done that on Checkpoint. I know on FortiGate we can use 0.0.0.0/0.0.0.0 and let the Policies do the Denying. Is there a way to do that on Checkpoint or how would you go about this problem ?

 But recently a loophole was discovered - on Android phones at least, users have the ability to trick the system by enabling desktop mode and then logging in through 2 factor.
 This is possible because getting into email by 2 factor through personal computers is allowed. But we don't want people on their phones doing it, otherwise what's the point of using an MDM? This loophole was discovered only on Android but it's possible it exists on iPhones too.

 I'm trying to fix the internal routing as the solution.
 PR-600mi network: 192.168.1.1/24 Linksys velop network: 10.10.10.1/24
 I had the Linksys velop on the 192 network but the pr600 was blackholing all dhcp requests and wouldn't work.
 Tried changing it to a different subnet but now the pr600 won't route to the 10.10 no matter what I do, including static routes.
 Does anyone have any experience with velop ? Maybe it is a Linksys side issue?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I knew that it would be complicated to do this but it seems almost impossible to me after trying for two days. 
 I am trying to do redirection using iptables. The number one problem is that local connections do not go through the PREROUTING chain in nat. I also suspect that they bypass the nat table altogether because none of the connections are reaching my rules in nat. 
 Is it possible to redirect traffic from the filter table instead of the nat table? 
 Before I started, I was worried about redirect loops but now I'll be happy if I get a redirect loop.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I was recently hired to a small company as the sole IT guy. I've had about two years of non-traditional Helpdesk experience at a different company handling their proprietary machines and software.
 The company I'm at now has about ~60 devices exclusively on MAC OS and no MDM, administrative directory or cybersecurity solutions in place. They want me to come up with a solution for phishing and other threats. I did some research on MDMs like Jamf Pro in conjunction with Apple Business Manager. I've also looked a bit at Barracuda for phishing. I've figured an MDM would be a good starting point but apparently need a strong knowledge-base to implement (lest I break something) along with some scripting.
 I'm honestly not really sure what direction to go in. Any resources for learning how to implement an MDM for Mac OS if this is the best route? Other suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I work for an MSSP and we have a customer sending Meraki logs to our SIEM - they have enabled FLOWS, which results in a "flow" type as well as a "ip_flow_start" and "ip_flow_end". The flow log contains more data than the start and end logs - it has the mac of the source, the outcome (allow or block)
 As far as I can tell, the only value of the start and end logs are calculating the elapsed time of a flow. However, there is no unique field that ties the two together, only the source and destination IP and port. 
 I don't think the SIEM has any rules that rely on the calculation of flow length - so I figured I should just turn these off to save the customer some $ on data ingestion costs.
 Has anyone ever disabled just the flow start/end logs? In the interface there is only the Flows role. Googling this tells me the customer may need to engage Cisco support in order to do this?

I personally have 10 large projects to manage and it’s chaos. I get constantly pulled into other peoples project meetings while trying to pull what ever resources I can into my projects. This leads to a stupid amount of unproductive meetings, no ownership, and nothing getting done. 
 I’ve told my managers they need to get some project managers on board, but am met with looks of bewilderment. Is this standard operating procedure at most large organizations?

I posted about this a couple months ago when I was trying to get the hardware, but now that I've had everything in my hands and have been trying to work with it, I'm stuck. I've literally been trying for 2 months. We currently have 2 TRENDnet TFC-110 MSTs that link our two buildings together using fiber. With the help of some others on Reddit, I purchased these two items (https://www.fs.com/products/11774.html and https://www.fs.com/products/43465.html). I got 3 of each to have backups in case one went bad. My Unifi switches recognize both SFP modules, but I cannot get the two switches to talk to each other with the fiber line that works just fine with the TRENDnet modules. Does anyone have ideas? I've tried everything I know (switching the fiber connections, restarting switches, changing cables/modules) and I'm stumped. Thanks!

 Now, this hasn't always been going on, and I'm not entirely sure what changed to make it begin popping up, but it's causing a lot of issues with our AnyConnect Management Tunnel connections, as the mgmt tunnel will not even attempt to connect if the credentials prompt is up. Once you "x" out of the prompt, the mgmt tunnel connects immediately.
 Has anyone else run into this?

 We have some later generation Extreme BOSS switches with multi-link trunking or MLT downstream to some VMWare ESXi servers. We have four links from the switch to one of our servers for instance.
 Are we supposed to ONLY configure trunks (no other LAG/LACP/MLT) downstream to these hypervisors? I noticed we have an exponential amount of broadcasts coming in from these MLT downstream switchports.
 IE on Cisco: conf t int fa0/1 switchport trunk encap dot1q switchport mode trunk
 We don't have a distributed vSwitch connecting to these switches.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a self-serving post where I am patting my own back, but I don't care. I'm happy.
 We rate people on a scale of 1-5, with 5 being the highest. Once a manager rates their employees, they need to justify the rating to senior management, who almost always challenge the rating, especially when it's a 4 or a 5. So, my manager is meeting with senior management and tells them he's giving me a 5, and they just say "We're good with that. Who's next."
 After that, he tells me what an outstanding job I do. How my troubleshooting skills are god-tier, at times. How somehow I seem to be available 24x7, and on and on.
 Honestly, I don't think I am all that exceptional. I MIGHT spend 15-20 minutes after hours responding to emails from people. And I usually stay VPNed in till the VPN times out at 8:00 PM and kicks me off. If someone needs something done and it takes 5 minutes, I just go do it, because I am already VPNed in and I don't want to deal with it in the morning.
 So, in a month, I don't work that much overtime. But when I am sitting in bed and watching something on my iPad and I see an email pop up where someone is asking for something simple, I'll just reply and tell them I can deal with it in the morning.
 So, this really is the ILLUSION of putting in an insane amount of after hours work. When it's really just me responding to an email now and then. As an old boss told me: carry your Blackberry on you at all times (this was the 2000s). 99% of the time, you'll never be bothered. But that one time someone calls you and you answer, you're everyone's hero. And they'll remember you're the guy who answered the phone when there was a problem.
 It's good to be recognized sometimes.

Used what I had which were cheap Netgear switches and now I've had to reboot a switch again due to a port or two locking up after 9 months of service. It is now unreliable and I need a replacement suggestion. Would like to go for 10G copper even though we have nothing with 10G just to be prepared. $2k budget each, 16 port or more. Nothing fancy. Don't need managed/L3/redundant PSU/etc. Max switching traffic at full load would be 2Gbps/ea but backups never run during business hours so it's unrealistic.
 I dug around for a bit. Is the Aruba 1960 any good for light iSCSI?

It was my understanding that you want a loopback address to be passive. Is this only the case if you are using OSPF to form an adjacency with other device or is it best practice to do reguardless of the routing protocol?

 I've been googling around searching for what would be the most practical solution to monitor our 6 /24 segments but I haven't found a definite answer. (We're a new and kinda small ISP).
 I've already set up a remote server that is monitoring these segments with Smokeping, but now we need a way to monitor them locally.
 I haven't found any info indicating that you can configure Smokeping to use a different interface or to ping with all interfaces, so, the faster solution would be to set up one Smokeping instance per each of our segments?
 Does anyone know a tool or service that could do this?
 Sorry if my English is a bit clunky, it is not my first language.
 Thanks in advance!
 EDIT: I just need basic ping and packet loss monitoring, like ping to Google, AWS, Netflix, Facebook, etc.
 nothing more at the moment.

 According to the article, someone 'high up' clicked on a bad link and it led to everything from their backups to payroll, scheduling, inventory, ordering and many other systems all being compromised. They also lost patient pharmaceutical info to the attackers.
 For this to be true it means a number of the most basic industry standard security practices were not followed, like:
  
MFA/Conditional access on remote access to email, VPN, RDP, etc...
 No separation of regular user accounts from admin, server and domain admin accounts
 Backups not immutable or air gapped
 Likely no 'next gen' firewall UTM monitoring internal servers
  
It also just seems crazy to me that so many systems could be accessible from a single user credential. This is a company that had $30 billion+ in sales last year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been having a problem with Azure Virtual WAN routing and was hoping somebody might have some insight. I also posted to /r/Azure but did not get any replies.
 For testing, I have created a network described by the network diagram at https://imgur.com/a/Yf0INds . In my scenario, I am creating a traffic flow from VNet_1 to 10.200.0.10. BGP is used between the VPN Branches and the VirtualHubs.
  
At first, the traffic flow uses path 1. This is expected.
 If path 1 becomes unavailable then the traffic flow uses path 2. This is expected.
 If path 1 recovers then the traffic flow continues to use path 2. This is not expected.
  
My expectations are mostly based on the routing scenarios from https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-wan/about-virtual-hub-routing-preference . My understanding is that path 1 should always be preferred if it is available because the Virtual Hub will prefer a directly connected route over a route from a remote hub. I would at least expect the routing decision to be deterministic.

 I am wondering if there is best practice when it comes to firewall deployment or is it whatever makes sense to you.
 For much smaller deployments, such as an office with 100 users or less, to me, it makes sense to just terminate on the firewall but then again im not concerned so much about the inter-vlan traffic and the firewall policies are a bit more lax compared to a datacenter rollout.

 https://i.imgur.com/Id3NwcL.png
 I recently added a second nexus to our core. For WAN connectivity, we have one MPLS link from the carrier plugged into the original Nexus. This nexus is learning the BGP routes from our remote sites just fine.
 The second Nexus, however, is not. Instead, it is learning the routes from the firewall via OSPF, as each site has a VPN tunnel to the firewall as a backup WAN connection.
 Is it possible for nexus2 to receieve the BGP routes from nexus1 in the short term? Ideally, we would get a second drop from the carrier to have an uplink in nexus2, and they could also establish it as a bgp peer.
 Otherwise, what are my options?
 I could add static routes for each remote subnet on nexus2, but that doesn't seem ideal, either.
 Right now, the bgp config on nexus1 is as follows:
 router bgp 999 address-family ipv4 unicast network 10.1.16.0/24 redistribute direct route-map allow redistribute ospf 1 route-map MPLS neighbor 10.1.99.2 remote-as 99 address-family ipv4 unicast soft-reconfiguration inbound always 
 And Nexus2, I configured bgp in case I ever needed to physically move the MPLS cable over.
 router bgp 999 address-family ipv4 unicast network 10.1.16.0/16 redistribute direct route-map allow redistribute ospf 1 route-map MPLS neighbor 10.1.99.2 remote-as 99 update-source Vlan999 address-family ipv4 unicast prefix-list no-default-route in router ospf 1 redistribute bgp 999 route-map MPLS passive-interface default redistribute ospf 1 route-map MPLS route-map MPLS permit 10 match route-type external internal

I change the MX Records in our multiple DNS Providers, Change TXT Records at our SPF tool, great. Now Email shouldn't go through Sophos anymore. Send a test mail from my private Gmail to all our domains, all arrive, check message trace, good, no sign of going through Sophos. 
 Now im deleting our domains in Sophos, delete the Message Flow Rule, delete the Sophos Apps in AAD. Everything seems to work. Four hours later, I'm testing around with OME encryption rules and send an email from the domain to my private Gmail. Nothing arrives. Fuck. 
 I tested external -> internal and internal -> internal, but didn't test internal-> external. Message trace reveals it still goes through the Sophos Connector, which I forgot to delete, that is pointing now into nothing. 
 Deleted the connector, it's working now. Used Message trace to find all mails in our Org that didn't go through and individually PMed them telling them to send it again. It was a virtual walk of shame. Hope I'm not getting fired.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I'm currently just messing around with some network traffic of an infusion pump and it's connection with the online configurator. The two are exchanging their communication via TCP. 
 I also did a vulnerability scan using GVM/OpenVAS and found out that the infusion pump is using an old/deprecated version of TLS (version 1.0).
 Now the data that is being exchanged is send in plain text (also a lot of sensitive data) despite TLS.
 I'm kinda new to networking and the whole security aspect that does with it so excuse my ignorance. However, shouldn't the data be encrypted in some sort because of the TLS that is implemented? The way i understand TLS is that the data is being encrypted right before it is being send over the TCP-Stream and then again decrypted at the destination.
 ​
 Any help is greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically we have a web application that all of our suppliers log into and do certain things for us. All of a sudden last week something changed and our users are having difficulties logging in. They are getting all kinds of TLS and connection refused errors. It works intermittently but when they are able to log in, page elements don't load, it says quotes are submitted when they actually aren't.
 It's extremely old obviously, it can only run in edge on compatibility mode now, it was originally designed for Internet explorer. The kicker is that there's been no maintenance paid on this and it cannot be updated without that maintenance, and the person who created it left the company 10 years before I joined. I asked around and there's nobody that supports this app nor has there been anybody since the man who created it left supporting it.
 Now I have procurement beating down my door in a panic because nobody can do what they need to do. I told them I have no knowledge of this and that the solution is to cough up the maintenance to get this working but I was told that isn't an option. My job duties do not include application support. I am a systems administrator. 
 I'm all for helping out where I can but what do I do?

 We just can't set "Domain" parameter in opendkim.conf because we are sending emails with hunderds if not thousands of domains.
 rspamd is not an option because it's too heavy weight (slows down the mail delivery singificantly at this scale of emails).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I had an interview with a recruitment agency today, was a general chat with the usual personality questions, from the junior consultant girl. Followed up with some more technical networking/infra questions from the senior interviewer. 
 Long story short, the senior said she's probably got something VMWare lined up with a 3-6 month contract, and will called back tomorrow with a series of technical questions. I am a systems/network administrator with proficient L1-L2 experience, and even build servers both physical and virtual from the ground up, utilizing technologies such as Hyper-V and VMware on the occasional blue moon, or when the need arises. I have been doing this for roughly 10 years. 
 Now I understand while the market is pretty good for IT jobs at the moment, I can't seem to get over the fact, that all these high level engineering questions get thrown at you, or something that is super specific to the business. Half the time it's not even listed on the job advert and here I am thinking yep, a suitable sysadmin role only to be thrown curveball after curveball of things non related to original advert, or what's listed on my resumé.
 Does anyone else experience these sorts of things in the application process and what sort of questions should I expect tomorrow? She knows I'm not VMWare certified but still stated that an 80% success on the questions will land me the job!!! 80%!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 My environment consists of ten terminals and two file servers in different sites.
 The file server consists of drives:
 D-data
 P - fslogix profiles disks
 L - logs for storage replica
 All on OS server 2019
 ​
 During business hours I ran the test-srtopology command and then the entire network was disabled.
 I guess it happened during the ICMP traffic test or during perfomance tests.
 I honestly couldn't find and understand why it affected the entry to the terminals.
 Because I performed the replication in general on a different drive from the profiles, I ran the test and the command on drive D.
 The logic says that there is no effect on the function but the facts show that the problem started close to the time I was working on the file server with the command I explained earlier.
 And the problem was solved when it was over.
 ​
 I would appreciate your help in understanding this, what was the problem?
 And is the storage replica solution suitable for file servers with a function like mine.
 Drive D contains regular files and documents.
 ​
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi there, I'm a bit of a beginner so was hoping to get some pointers on how to achieve the below please. Apologies if my question appears ignorant. Any input at all would be greatly appreciated.
 I am looking for a way to streamline some aspects of my job by doing some remote commissioning of PLCs, BACnet gateways, Modbus devices etc.
 While I am completing these works at the moment, the site is typically under construction, so there is no internet access or core switch operational. I have to manually plug into network switches around the the site and configure devices that way.
 I have got my hands on a cellular 3G router and have got it configured so I can use it to remotely connect to a site PC via RDP and use that for remote commissioning.
 What I would like to achieve is being able to plug this 3G router in to any isolated network switch on site and be able to connect to and pull data from devices such as the PLCs and gateways dynamically and communicate with a remote PC rather than a local RDP.
 Ideal setup would be:
  
Remote PC at home (192.168.xxx.xxx)
 3G router plugged into switch on site (10.10.xxx.xxx)
 Applications on Remote PC at home able to communicate with IP devices plugged in to network switch on site (For example opening my PLC configuration program and plugging in the 10.10.xxx.xxx IP Address to be able to configure it remotely.
  
I have got the dynamic DNS side of things working and am aware I can set up specific connections via port forwarding, but I am looking for a more dynamic solution where someone on site can plug this router into any switch on site and I will be able to talk to any of the 10.10.xxx.xxx devices dynamically without having to set up dedicated port forwarding for each unique IP address.
 Is a solution like this feasible, or should I continue with the site laptop/3G router combo I am currently using for remote access via RDP?
 Appreciate your time and input.

 I want to assign applications through groups such as (Core Apps, Engineering, QA, Customer Ops) groups based on departments/roles within the business which will help in me automating application access. 
 My main concern currently is all the applications assigned directly to existing users, I wanted to avoid doubling up giving access but I'm struggling to think of a way to put everyone into groups, giving them the access they need and not creating duplicates. 
 Of course there's the manual route which I'm happy to do but will be kicking myself if there's an easier way to do it and i find out after.

What systems/processes would you put in place? 
 I.e. would you gift their laptops or pick them up? How would you pick them up if mainly remote employees? If gifted, what are the security risks? I know so many people who were left with blank, locked/unusable new laptops when they left their company. Seems such a waste, especially given the supply issues atm. 
 I’m new to all this, so I’d love to have some ideas in my back pocket just in case something like this were to happen at my company.

 It works, but is a nasty experience, especially on Android where the user has to choose encryption type (LEAP, PEAP etc) and certificate - with Google Pixel not working at all. On desktop and Apple devices it's tidier just taking the username and password.
 I'm being sold CloudPath as a solution but I just can't wrap my head around why I need an extra product.
 I've managed to get a landing page to authenticate to AD which works OK, except for all the certificate errors for the Ruckus landing page and then for XGS.
 Anyone got an idiots guide on how to improve this or am I going to have to fork out for a proper onboarding solution?

 Our Commvault 5 year deal is coming to an end.
 I'm not in that company so ling, so I inherited it with the job.
 It's going to end in about 5 months and I was considering my options.
 I've been working with veeam before, so I am familiar with it, but also considering 2 more vendors, veratis and rubrik.
 I was wondering if anyone can offer some technical tips in 2 scopes:
  
Things to check when look for a solution, like deduplication and encryption for example 
 
Comparison with the vendors I mentioned from your experience. 
 
 My current setting in comvault is with a dell scv2020 and a server connecting the storge (called media agent).
 For comvault renewal I've been notified the server won't be needed anymore but the storage is out of service.
 I can get 3rd party support for the storage, using it for a few more years and saving costs but I understand other vendors has their own appliances with internal storage and such, that will probably cost more to implement then using the storage I have now.
 I mostly backup DB, important data server and our vcenter.
 Also backing up to cloud, using metallic. 
 Any advises?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve always loved linux and networking since I was a kid in highschool. My greatest project at that time was putting msfconsole on a jailbroken iPad mini. This project took me 2 weeks to complete (slacked off about half those days) but once finished it gave me biggest rush to see msfconsole load up, even if I did absolutely nothing with it. I knew I had to do this for a living. 
 fast forward, graduate college with a BS associates in computer programing because I hate school and couldn’t beat another 2 years. Finally get my degree at 20 and what do I do with it? Nothing. For 3 years. Since out of highschool I worked BS manual labor jobs. I always knew I wanted more, but didn’t think my degree would get me anything. Until 6 months ago. 
 Now, by pure luck, I’m a tier 1 sysadmin (skipped help desk completely) at a VoIP company, writing a script to fully automate the setup of a wireless modem in a fanless PC, to cut a two box implementation down to 1, and simplify the process for those who need to install the equipment. 
 Pinch me I’m dreaming. 
 There’s nothing like the feeling of rebooting a device, watching your logs show you over and over again a successful setup, and knowing the months it took to make this happen resulted in a (somewhat) stable configuration.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know what some might say right away, imposter syndrome, etc, and there might be some of that.
 But in other real ways I’m not good enough at my job and it’s hurting me, hurting the clients, and hurting the customers.
 There’s really two problems: one is that I’m tech-savvy and have a real knack for this stuff, but past a certain level of technical difficulty and outside of a certain level of emergency I lose focus and falter in knowledge. Like, if the server is down right now, I can figure outa way to get it back up. I might not be able to articulate how, but I’ll get it running again. But ask me to troubleshoot what happened after the fact and I’ll flounder. Similarly if you give me a bunch of machines and an end result, I can get them running… but are they configured correctly, or do they just “kinda work”?
 The second is I really have a hard time working hard enough or doing the work I need to be doing. If I don’t have a person calling now, I try to go to my ticket queue, and I can sit and stare at tickets or click in and out of them multiple times without doing anything. And that’s if I don’t give in to the temptation do something else entirely. I’ve blocked Reddit, Twitter, and Facebook on work computers during the day, and it helps, but I can still find ways to not do work. I have things that sit in a queue for days or weeks because I get so anxious I avoid them until I can’t any longer.
 I’m failing the rest of my team, and I feel like shit all the time about it. And that just makes it worse.
 I think about jumping ship to another job, but I actually like the company and people I work for, and I know it would only help for six months to a year, and I’d be right back where I started.
 I don’t know, this may not be the place to talk about this, this is less a technical conversation than maybe mental health mixed with discipline, but maybe some of you have some advice to help me get back on track.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have two industrial machines that communicate via broadcast and multicast traffic. 
 I'm trying to block a set of ports and multicast addresses while keeping the other broadcast and multicast features working. 
 So far the devices I have laying around will only apply the firewall on routed traffic, not touching the devices on the same network.
 Looking for a recommendation on a device. Hoping to avoid a micro PC with two network ports: our setup is portable, people tend to yank power before worrying about shutdown sequences.
 Details:
 Broadcast is used for detection then multicast for actual communication, so both machines need to be on the same LAN to play nicely.
 They also use two realtime communication protocols at the same time, one protocol is nice and efficient, and the other one tries to hog the entire link to itself. The nice protocol uses IGMPv2 and the 236.0.0.0 range, the other protocol is a blackbox but uses 239.0.0.0 and opens ports 30000 thru 30007. I think if I could drop 239.0.0.0 and the associated ports I could solve my issues.
 I'm trying to add Point 2 Point wireless for long range comms using the lightweight protocol, but the heavyweight protocol seems to saturate the wireless bridge and the lightweight protocol can't connect. Everything works OK enough with Wifi 6 links, but I'm trying for hundreds of feet in a noisy environment, with TP Link P2P or Ubiquiti P2P limited to their 100Mbps ports. Upgrading to the 5ghz P2P stuff seems like kicking the can down the road, since at 15 feet away the heavyweight protocol is laggy over 802.11ax.
 Googling around brings me to articles about "Packet Filtering Firewalls", but without naming any devices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was using explorer patcher to move my taskbar to top successfully before 22H2. But yesterday my computer got updated and the taskbar went back down. So, I tried a bunch of stuff until I managed to get it back on top and, as I found this instruction nowhere, I share here in case someone needs it.
 The difference between this solution and the regular instruction I found around the internet is that they all suggest editing values of a "MMStuckRects3" key, which was working for me before 22H2, but not anymore. The hack is to add a new REG_BINARY to the registry key below (create if does not exist):
 [HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\MMStuckRectsLegacy]
 The name of this new value must be the device instance path (second property when navigating to Devices Manager > Monitors > (target monitor name) > Properties > Device Instance Path). Get everything after "DISPLAY\" and replace the other "\" by "#", such as:
  
Device Instance Path: DISPLAY\PHLC056\5&3C07B47&0&UID266
 Registry key name: PHLC056#5&3c07b47&0&UID266 (letters in lower case between # and &UID)
  
Using this as the name of the value, enter the following binary value:
 30 00 00 00 fe ff ff ff 00 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 3e 00 00 00 28 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 60 00 00 00 01 00 00 00
 Restart explorer.exe or sign out/in and the second monitor taskbar should be at the top.
 Hope it helps!

 Checked firewall it's online. Connect to win server, can't login, that's weird i thought to myself. Decide to login to hypervisor instead from my laptop, sees clients vm offline, tries to boot one, says cannot locate vm disk, my eyes bulge. At that point I'm like WTF. I browser to the location of the disk.... Everything encrypted with ransomware. My heart skips a beat and i nearly stumble. No worries, i told myself, I'll just fire up the replicas on the backup and everyone back up.....WTF replica encrypted too. Dig deeper, entire datacenter compromised. 
 Esxi + ransomware = how da hell that happen? Stuff like that will make a grown man want to cry. I literally have sleepless night and when i do sleep it give me nightmares

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A bit of background:
 I'm responsible for deploying Android-based devices in MDU/manufacturing/healthcare environments. Anywhere from 50 to over 1500 at a time. The process involves updating the device firmware and enrolling into an EMM/MDM of some sort. Because of the nature of the industry, a lot of the time we're forced to use guest Wi-Fi networks or a mobile hotspot to do so, which means we're limited to running 4-8 at a time, and even then, still run into issues that require a reset and re-enroll of the device.
 That said: here are the back-end requirements needed to complete these steps:
  
For the firmware updates, an HTTP/S server (apache, IIS, nginx, etc.) w/ relatively quick on-board storage (SATA SSD or PCIe NVMe).
 For Google services and EMM enrollment, a decent (unrestricted) pipe to the internet.
  
I'm thinking I can kill two birds with a single device, but I've yet to find something that supports the following:
  
Wifi 6 router supporting HTTP/S server functionality and
 Cellular WAN functionality (5G or LTE cat. 16 or better) OR
 the ability to authenticate via RADIUS to hotel landing pages that require a last name and room number, for example.
  
My initial thoughts are to go with an x86 appliance such as the FW6D from Protectli, though I wanted to get your thoughts before I made a decision. 
 Thanks in advance!!

 The use case is so that individual neighbors can influence the path they take to get to some shared network resources.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Last couple jobs were at a large regional ISP. I mostly did the capacity maintenances for the edge aggregation routers to the core, via ROADM. I’d add and drop fiber links from the ring, add the configurations for the new interfaces in IOS-XR, write the MOP, sometimes order equipment and deploy it to a hub, and either ran the maintenance or scheduled it to a overnight guy to do for me. 
 I also did new turn-ups of E-BGP peers on the CRS-16, and helped manage the core route reflectors. We were first escalation for outages as well. 
 I left work for FMLA reasons and my confidence is low. Most jobs are enterprise and not sure what to expect really. It’s hard for me to remember some topics I knew inside and out. Managed primary the underlay transport but did some MPLS L2VPN, L3VPN, and VRF stuff for enterprise BGP peering.
 Anyone have any tricks or tips to quickly catch myself back up? I find re-reading material I’ve already read to be difficult. It’s like the information is in the back of my head and the moment I read it again it becomes boring.
 Also having trouble finding interviews. I used to get several lined up and competing offers. Barely even getting responses from company recruiters. Often passed up and never even spoken too.

 An interface in NetBox (our DCIM) is updated > A webhook is sent to a server > A script is executed with a number of details about the interface (access/voice/trunked, etc) which launches an Ansible playbook enacting the changes made in NetBox.
 It's working decently, but I've ran into an issue. One of the plays is meant to configure an access and voice VLAN on an interface, but it appears to be executing the commands out of order. Specifically, I think it is trying to disable trunk encapsulation before setting the interface's mode to access (this particular interface was set to trunk prior to trying to run this test).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I almost posted this in r/homenetworking because the needs are so basic. 
 My friend has asked me to recommend a router for his small business office. They only need it for delivering internet to their staff laptops. They don't have an internal network/domain or anything. All of their HR and Scheduling they just use websites for and all storage is google cloud storage. 
 They have equipment from Cox but the router constantly drops connections and has a weak signal at the far end the building. And it seems to be limited to 10 connections simultaneously when there are generally about 15 to 18 people in the office at peak. 
 They're just looking for something that's fairly simple to setup/manage, can deliver solid speeds, and allow upwards of 20+ users simultaneously. 
 It almost seems like any basic router will do the job, but I think signal strength was my concern as the office isn't HUGE, but their internet comes in in one corner of the building so the router will go there, and have to pass through many many walls to reach the offices at the opposite end. 
 Thanks for any recommendations

 We are Cisco only shop and about to purchase a few new c1000, but due to long shipping dates, we also got an offer for cbs 220. 
 I understand that the CLI is limited but my question is how much it is limited compared to IOS? 
 And other than that, what are the main differences between the 2 switches? Note that we are probably not going to use stacking and additional power supplies. Is the cbs220 weaker hardware and performance wise compared to the c1000?
 Thanks.

 ​
 Currently we have a very basic network. The only redundancy we have is our firewall which I believe I am going to upgrade to Palo, but maybe Fortinet. The current switches we have are simply access switches. SG500X switches that are not stacked. I have been pressing to upgrade the configuration and it may happen.
 Do you think some type of Collapsed Core implementation is overkill for this network?
 I have been looking at possibly going Aruba for core and access or do i keep the SG500X's and just get a 9200
 I am trying not to freak them out with pricing but now is the time to future proof some of our equipment so i have a good argument.
 Thoughts? Recommendations? Thanks.
 Edit: Adding a few notes on how our network is used.
 Email - 365
 SharePoint for some doc storage
 Data warehouse located in Azure (Tunnel back to office)
 2 Hyper V hosts basic servers (AD/DNS/Storage/Dynamics GP/RRAS)
 Datto which will most likely be decommissioned and will use our Veeam server as backup target along with NAS that will stay at our old office for offsite.

 But within the next week, she will disappear from her team. 
 If it matters, this user was an active member of the organization back in 2019, left to have a baby, and just came back this past month. Her account was never removed. Her sign-in was rescinded and her mailbox was set to shared. When she got rehired, we just re-issued her a Business Standard License and set her mailbox back up. 
 But every Monday, when she opens her teams app, it shows her as "not a member" of any teams, and she's not permitted to join any unless I go through the admin portal and do it. 
 ​
 What could I be missing? Should I just delete everything and recreate the user entirely to be rid of this headache?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I had my renewal meeting today and I knew this was coming and was prepared for it. What I was not prepared for is that Veeam is actually charging a fee to migrate you from the Socket Model to the VUL Model. This fee is as much as my renewal. In what world does this make sense? We want to move folks to our new VUL (which will increase me $2K per year on its own) but we are going to make their renewal cost double to do it? So, you want me to pay a fee to pay you more? You would think they would SAVE you money year 1 to get you into the new model. I'm no rocket scientist, but what idiot approved this or thought this would fly with customers?
 I know Veeam is the best, blah blah blah, but this was a kick straight to the face and honestly is disgusting that they think this is acceptable. I haven't considered a competitor in 10 years, but this "fee" is hard to ignore. I'd go with not Veeam out of principle at this point.

 You setup meeting rooms perfectly. Everything is working as expected.
 First meeting over, nothing's working anymore.
 Cables are no longer in the ports where they belong etc.
 What solutions do you have?
 I am looking for some tools/utilities to connect stuff in a way it can't be removed for example but still "looks good".
 Can't glue it :) Would look a bit strange. When i did some research on the net i wondered that i could not find a lot regarding this topic. I would assume this is something a lot of us have to struggle with?
 Any tips, hints, links?

One even said they decided they weren't going to hire anyone immediately, but asked if they could call me back in a couple of months.

 He also mentioned we have an "internal LAN block which doesnt get advertised but you could utilize them and they get routed through your WAN IP" Is there a name for something like this I could do more research on? I am at a loss for what that means.

 I am basically just doing different checks and the at the end I get a bunch of lines saying complaint or Not compliant.
 Is there a way I can summarize all these print statements? Like at the end say "10 compliants and 2 not complaints". That way I don't have to read down through everything, I can just get one line saying how many of each?
 Also want to point out that this will be run on multiple switches. So it would be nice to maybe at the end print "switch 192.168.1.1 has 2 complaints and 10 not complaints". Or something like that.

I can SSH to the outside interface (access is restricted to our Corporate IP block) and reboot them and they come back up and will function normally for days.
 We haven't encountered this issue on the 5508X's that we have, only the 5506X's. 
 This began occurring when we updated to 9.16.3.15 but we're now on 9.16.4 and the problem is still occurring.
 We are in the process of migrating to FPR-1010's but this issue is a PITA. 
 Looking at the syslogs it appears to happen each time the IPSEC tunnel is recreated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company has used Teamviewer for over a decade. In that time they forced us to purchase not one, but two different so-called "Lifetime licenses"
 When purchasing the first license they failed to mention that when they upgraded their software they would push a new version to our clients before we could have a chance to stop it, and then almost immediately prevented us from connecting to our managed systems without first upgrading.
 After we purchased these "lifetime" licenses, they abruptly switched to a subscription model.
 The cost of that subscription has increased by about 100% in the last 4 years, and now they've implemented really low device limits!
 So not only has my cost doubled, I would have to purchase additional licensing just to keep managing the same number of computers I have managed all along.
 Save your money, go with another vendor!
 **Edit**
 After sending an email to the entire leadership at TV, expressing my amazement that they intended to try to extort a final year's subscription from us, the very rude person I initially spoke to, that kept incorrectly asserting that we always had device limits on our account, called back to once again try to offer me discounts to keep me with their company.
 I thanked her for giving me content for my most popular reddit post ever, and read off the contracts from 2015 and later to her on the phone. Now they're going to go ahead and cancel us without trying to forcibly renew. Pfft

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have a simple question with a probably not so simple answer.
 We have an Out of Office calendar that I wanted to automate a bit more of so that after people submitted their OOO reason they didn't have to manually categorize the event with a specific color.
 To do this, I created mail flow rules on the Room Resource inbox that applied categories based on subject line text. This is working, but comes with a side effect that the attendees are showing on the meeting subject - example below:
  
MySecretWork Account - WFH; Out of Office; MySecretWork Account
  
I already went into the room resource and adjusted the following settings:
  
Set-CalendarProcessing -Identity outofoffice@domain.com -DeleteSubject $False -AddOrganizerToSubject $False
  
This was done so that the subject line wouldn't be replaced solely by the organizer's name. Attendees are now showing up on calendar though, which adds a bunch of clutter to calendar.
 I just want the meeting requests on the Out of Office calendar to look like the below:
  
MySecretWork Account - WFH
  
No extra info - just the actual subject line of the meeting request.
 Is this possible? I didn't see anything on the Set-CalendarProcessing documentation page, but if there is a setting elsewhere that can achieve this (either GUI or PowerShell) please let me know!

 I recently changed a bunch of users UPN from [jd@domain.com](mailto:jd@domain.com) to [jd@dom.com](mailto:jd@dom.com) and now some of the users cannot log in to their PC, with the SAMAccountName.
 Their SAMAccountName would be something like domain\domjd
 Has anyone experienced something simular to this before?
 Is there perhaps some registry etc. that needs to be changed?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[so from the research i did ive learnt,
  
and anyone who has the exported PST file in their Pc, can import it to Outlook and use it that way.
 to use this feature you need to have some specific license For the organization account first and another license specific license for the user account
 Exchange online Plan 2, Microsoft 365 E3, Office 365 E3 or anything higher will do for the org account
 And Depending on the license the organization has the employee account must have one the licenses below.
  
 Exchange online Plan 2 license
 Microsoft 365 E3 or Office 365 E3 license or higher
 Microsoft 365 Business Premium (Exchange only) license
 Office 365 E1 license with an Exchange Online Plan 2 or Exchange Online Archiving add-on license
 Microsoft 365 Frontline F5 Compliance or F5 Security & Compliance add-on license
  
And one of these license as well assigned to them. Office 365 E1 license with a SharePoint Online Plan 2 or OneDrive for Business Plan 2 add-on license 
 are these correct?
 and also after exporting a mailbox, can i unassign the license and re-assign to another user? instead of buying 10-20 licenses?

 Other users can be added and removed fine from the on-prem AD but this user is just stuck in the group which they need to be removed from. 
 I’ve tried syncing an on prem account with their cloud account and adding then removing, but they still are stuck in this group.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 So I've got a client who has started receiving the following message pretty frequently over the last month or so: 
 "Trying to connect to: \\domain.tld\SharedData\fileshare"
 It seems to occur mainly in Office apps ie Word, Excel, Project but then again these are the primary apps they use. I can generally replicate it by going File -> Open, open any file, then go File -> Save As and immediately I get the dialog box with the above message. Once it resolves (after up to a minute) and the document saves it doesn't occur again for a period of time. To me that smacks of DNS but I can resolve the share via Windows Explorer or by doing an nslookup at any time before or after opening and saving and it resolves with no issues.
 Environment is Windows Server 2019 on premises Active Directory running two DCs in Hyper-V VMs on two different physical hosts. I'm running DFS Namespace with both DCs listed under Namespace servers. Less than 50 clients. Clients are all Windows 10 with two Windows 11 machines connected via either wireless or gigabit ethernet. Addresses are assigned via DHCP and both DCs are the only DNS servers assigned. Office applications range from 2016 to 365.
 It must be DNS (even when it isn't lol) but I confess I'm not sure where to go from where or how else to troubleshoot. If you can access a share immediately via Windows Explorer, or have nslookup return an immediate correct result, what else is left? And yet the problem still occurs to the point that people are getting visibly frustrated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 In our Azure tenant we have recently imported 300 or so guest users and are now in the process of troubleshooting the 10 or so that have sign-in problems. Most of these problems are pretty clear and solvable, but there's one that I can't figure out.
 We invited this user with a [x@gmail.com](mailto:x@gmail.com) address, and she tries to sign in with that address. When she does however, the AADSTS50020 error occurs, with a completely different [y@hotmail.com](mailto:y@hotmail.com) address:
 https://imgur.com/x2W1T6y 
 Now, AFAIK that error means that e-mail address isn't known in our tenant, which is correct, since [y@hotmail.com](mailto:y@hotmail.com) isn't invited in our tenant, [x@gmail.com](mailto:x@gmail.com) is.
 When I check the [x@gmail.com](mailto:x@gmail.com) user in our Azure AD, i can't find the hotmail address anywhere:
 https://imgur.com/lLMJpPh 
 https://imgur.com/W1U5Vyj 
 My suspicion is that somehow the [x@gmail.com](mailto:x@gmail.com) address is linked to that person's MS account. 
 My question is, how do I solve this? I could invite [y@hotmail.com](mailto:y@hotmail.com) into our Azure AD, but the [y@hotmail.com](mailto:y@hotmail.com) is an old address of this person which she no longer wishes to use. So I need to solve this and have this person log in with their [x@gmail.com](mailto:x@gmail.com) address.
 Any ideas? Thanks everyone!

 I understand that it doesn't require dns, so what makes sense to me is that it is primarily needed for use in non-active directory network environments. Is that right?
 And/or is there some other reason for it being functional in active directory? I.e. does it actually provide something that active directory doesn't or can't?
 While I am here asking questions I will also ask, what in your estimation is the prevalence of non-Active Directory Windows networks these days? (I can see small offices/doctors/dentist surgery sized places not needing active directory)
 Thanks in advance!
 Fwiw I have googled and read several links but haven't found anything that really helps me understand why it exists at all now.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good morning or afternoon, fellow guys and girls.
 I have a new issue on some of my notebooks I have never seen before. We deployed a new Update to our Check Point VPN Client on ~ 100 devices. On a minority of the devices, the updated caused to kill the device's connectivity completely. The WiFi Adapter still shows networks it can (and also can connect to them) but then reports "No Internet access".
 An "ipconfig" reveals what's going on: it shows nothing at all. It seems like Windows lost track of it's adapters.
 Unfortunately, uninstalling networking devices does not do anything. Manually installing the Ethernet and/or the WiFi driver doesn't resolve it either. The only solution we had until now was to completely reinstall Windows.
 Additionally, the Event Log does not show anything relevant to find the actual cause neither.
 ​
 Has anyone else had this issue and might know a solution that does not include calling the user to the office for a reinstallation?

I know office 365 is pretty convenient as it can be accessed from anywhere.

 I just want to know what are support projects/Production support mean ?
 Like do you mean windows admin,azure admin, Linux admin, active directory admin, backup admin , Database admin..etc are known as produc
 If you say these are production support roles, what makes you think there's no learning curve ?? For example) Active Directory and Group Policy itself an ocean !!! 
 If the above roles are not production support, then what roles are and what are their daily roles and responsibilities?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Does anyone have any recommendation for a PCIE raid card. I have a client that is considering to use a workstation as a offsite backup/monitoring/metrics server. Since the server is in a remote location space is limited. We plan on utilizing it to run ESXI with one datastore to run a freenas server (to handle replications) and a few other VMs for monitoring and testing.
 Yes we thought about using freenas's vm and jails but we opted to run it in an esxi environment.
 And before anyone starts saying anything we already have onsite and a remote backup solution. This is just a hey if we lose a lot of data lets see if we can restore here before we send in an order to recall data. 
 Obviously if you have any links (and yes ebay included) that would be great. Ideally we are looking for new pcie raid cards that can connect sata disks. Refurb units will be fine but we are looking for at least some sort of warranty to replace the card within a year if something were to happen.
 ​
 I was also thinking of getting this from newegg
 https://www.newegg.com/p/14G-0006-001G5?quicklink=true
 And passing the card in to the freenas VM itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone of r/sysadmin, I’m a young up and comer in the IT world and not even a sysadmin, been doing this for 2 years now. My journey started off at a local technical school where I was taught the basics of IT and networking, from there I got my A+, Net+ and CCNA. 
 Fast forward to today, and I find myself in a nice helpdesk position with a lot of downtime that in 5 months I have been able to completely study and pass my ms-203, my Sec+ as well as the ms-100 and now looking at the ms-101 as well as the company is paying for a course for my az-104. 
 Well, as I have been doing these I have been looking around at jobs because well, helpdesk isn’t my goal, I love working with the MS cloud suite and would love to get into a position where working with that stuff is my main responsibility, but everywhere I look, I may have some of the requirements, a lot of place are asking for many more years of experience, but the one thing I’m seeing most is that darned piece of paper I don’t have. A degree. 
 So that brings me to my question for you guys, if you have a degree, when did you get yours? I’m only 23 myself and kind of figure there’s no reason I shouldn’t just do it, and I was looking and a lot of the courses for an Associates in Cloud Architecting are for certs I already have, so I would think it would be a cakewalk.

 Now I've done a lot of $$ number crunching etc on the relative costs and risks, but what they're asking for is actual case studies about why product lifecycles are important, and the increased risk of device failures based on age of the device.
 I can find the government (AU) tax department info about expected product lifecycles, but I'm having trouble finding any actual case study analysis of why those are the expected product lifecycles. 
 Anyone know of any such studies they can share?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry if I come off as rude but I just feel like expressing my opinion regarding the stereotype in IT that we're all supposed to be grumpy and unhelpful. At least that's the perception, I've met so many people that will straight up ignore you if they haven't created a ticket or booked in a meeting to solve an issue. 
 I feel like an alien for just being a happy-go-lucky chap willing to help out anyone and everyone. It's a good feeling to be someone who's reliable and a go to source for info or assistance. 
 I also see a lot of posts on /r/itcareerquestions regarding "What are IT jobs where I never ever have to talk to anyone?". The answer is none. You will need to talk to people and being able to talk to people will make your life and others so much easier. 
 Just wondering if anyone else feels the same way as I do.
 EDIT: I'm starting to think that I haven't become the 'grumpy introvert' is because I have been in the industry long enough for it to crush my soul yet...

 Also, just as important, how can I determine if other files are being affected?
 Original post:
 Hopefully, this is only happening on one file, but I'm not sure I would know.
 Document stored in SharePoint mysteriously disappeared. It is not in the recycle bin, but I did find an old version in our SaaS backup and restored that.
 Minutes after restoring the file to its original location, it disappeared again. We cannot figure out why.
 Additional information: I tried restoring the file to its original location, but it did not restore. I restored to a separate SharePoint site where it happily sits waiting as instructed. Then, I download a copy to its original location and it's gone in minutes.
 Any idea what might be causing this?

 i am currently using an on-prem RMM service for my clients. I currently allow NAT from known clients ips to my RMM ports. I do not expose those ports to any other IP.
 However, i want to use the RMM on client laptops when they are not onsite. I do not trust all these laptops, some are residential users and some are personal devices.
 Can i create a VPN (using OPNsense) to a "dead in the water" local network, using split-tunnel with the only route being to/from RMM ports, with no other traffic allowed? I basically just want to route RMM traffic so that it comes from a known IP.
 Is VPN secure used in this way? Is there any risk of clients reaching local network resources?

They basically seem to extend the vulnerability and security support by 2 years. As the Catalyst 3650 & 3850's will never get IOS XE v17.x support, IOS XE v16.12.x will be the last version to run on these. The EoL announcement for IOS XE v16.12.x also states:
  
Please Note: Catalyst 3650 and Catalyst 3850 platforms are not part of this EOL announcement. Refer to 3650/3850 Hardware EOL announcement for software support timelines.
  
Are we correct to state that with this Cisco is committing themselves to keep IOS XE v16.12.x alive for these platforms and fix future security issues might they be discovered? Because it seems like a lot of overhead to keep supporting such an old codebase. However these dates are important for us during budget meetings to help decide which devices to replace so we'd like to be correct in the interpretation.

 I’m testing Windows 11 on a couple of devices now, to prepare for a gradual rollout of the new OS to 300+ domain-joined devices over the next year. I’m testing registry changes locally but will need them to be pushed out via GPO eventually.
 I want to update the central store from the ‘Windows 10 21H2 v2’ Template to the ‘Windows 11 21H2’Template but am worried there would be issues like some Windows 10 reg entries being removed as they’re not needed in Windows 11.
 Have any of you run into issues after upgrading the templates when it’s a mixed environment?
 TIA for your help, never done this before and the old sysadmin is gone so I have no one here to guide/train me apart from good old Google! I don’t want to make too many mistakes and have the higher-ups on my case just a month into the new role!

 Does anyone else feel like in the time it takes to learn Ansible, you might as well just learn Python? Python is so powerful and arguably easier to implement more complex tasks once you get the hang of it. In the time it takes you to learn all of the modules in Ansible, I feel like you could just learn Python.
 I also feel like the error handling and debugging capabilities of Ansible are horrible. I know Ansible is not a programming language, however, I’ve noticed a lot of organizations that attempt to treat it as if it is. 
 This post isn’t to crap on Ansible, I am genuinely curious why some of you prefer it. 
 I am well aware that Ansible is written in Python, no need to iterate that point when most of us here are aware of that.

 What makes sense to me is that it is primarily needed for use in non-active directory environments. Is that right? Why is it still available in active directory environments (i.e. is there some other networking reason for it being there, or does it actually provide something that active directory doesn't/can't)? 
 Thanks in advance!
 Fwiw I have googled and read several links but haven't found anything that really helps me understand why it exists at all now.

 Went down a random Wikipedia rabbit hole last night and came across the ECHO, DISCARD and DAYTIME protocols. Curiosity got the best of me and I enabled them on an old Raspberry Pi just to test them out. I think the DAYTIME protocol is handy, almost like a (slimmed down) NTP alternative, and the DISCARD protocol could be useful as a network-based /dev/null.
 What other protocols exist out there in the same vein? What use, if any, do they have in modern networks? What are some maybe fun or obscure protocols that can still be run on modern IP networks? I'd love more ideas to investigate here. Thanks!

 I know this is from pure lazyness as we have VPN access to all of the customers. 
 What do you guys think, is it considered "safe" enough to leave Teamviewer running when it's locked down to our account only, and all users are only "members" in the teamviewer company. 
 I had the pros / cons with multiple colleagues about this, and both sides got good arguments. 
 What are your thoughts of this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have worked as a sysadmin and devops for the last 15 years, last 7 years were in one company at the DevOps engineer and Site Reliability Engineer roles, but I had to quit for health-related issues. In my work I touched each part of the stack from hardware to Linux and Windows administration, to networking, monitoring, alerting, databases, webservers, data analysis and report building using SQL, troubleshooting issues involving many moving parts, log management, writing custom instruments in python, AWS, CI/CD, docker, incident resolution involving many people, so in general I’m quite familiar with modern Sysadmin and DevOps practices.
 It might look like a tremendous overkill for what I’m looking for, but right now my ability to work is quite limited, so I’m looking for small jobs involving server support and troubleshooting and some log and data analysis, which won’t take much of my time, but I can be oncall and available to fix issues on the need-to basis, and I can provide 24//7 coverage for critical infrastructure, first setting up some infrastructure for projects which concerns alerting and availability practices.
 I also did some mentoring for my friends concerning networking, linux, basic programming and server administration, because I like doing it. I even once wrote a Linux tutorial.
 I’m sure there should be demand for this and people would be interested in paying some monthly fee for someone skilled for looking after their stuff, but I don’t really know how to find it, because I’m used to working full-time in large companies. I tried but had no luck with Upwork for this, and I would like to learn places where I can find such gigs or talk to people and network.
 Thank you for your time.
 P.S. I didn’t write on reddit for a long time, but I was active here once, and for those interested, this is my old account: https://old.reddit.com/user/mwargh/submitted/ My Linux tutorial is here if you wanna look at my style: https://archive.ph/xDb8o

 A little bit of background. I've about 7 years of experience, worked with L2/L3 protocols, L2/L3VPN, MPLS, EVPN-VXLAN etc. I can't say I'm an expert at all these networking areas, but I've decent understanding on these. I've also worked with Cisco and Juniper OS and quite familiar with variants within and products. 
 Last two years I've picked up python and really like coding and automating some stuff. I think I like it more than the networking part itself. What kind of jobs are there where my networking experience will be beneficial but I get to do some python coding? I don't think I can go full software development as it seems daunting task to start from zero and my networking experience would be wasted. Any advice would be much appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi alll,
 Preface: Using the OpenVPN server built into PFsense and using the OpenVPN Connect Client as it works across multiple platforms.
 I’ve been trialing OpenVPN with a MS NPS and the Azure MFA plugin installed. All is working well, I can press connect, get an MFA push etc
 However, i have been testing idle timeouts and have a potential issue. When the client times out, the session disconnects but will reconnect immediately and try over and over again, spamming Azure MFA. 
 On two occasions now, Push Notifications have just stopped working. I can’t get it to work again. I’ve removed the Authenticator device from the security portal, but when I go to add it back it fails (have tried via sign-in in the app as well which works), but still no push notifications. I have also checked blocked users in the multifactor authentication blade, but the account is not listed there.
 The only way I’ve found to get push notifications to work again, is to delete and recreate the 365 user, which is of course not ideal. 
 Has anyone experienced the issue with Push notifications being blocked? I raised a case with support but they have been absolutely useless.
 EDIT: The error code I get is Error Code: 500121

 They don't out-right fail but start to exhibit performance issues or have errors that prevent full system backups from completing (e.g. Macrium image backup).
 We are able to successfully clone them using ddrescue with a few KB of bad sectors detected.
 Firmware updates, trimming, and chkdsk /r do not resolve the issue with the drives and these drives have had the latest firmware on them.

 I recently climbed up to “Senior Systems Administrator”, and apart from the slight impostor syndrome, I’ve come to wonder, where do you go from here? 
 Yeah I did support roles, I put together servers, configure ESXi and RAID, design and implement Networks and Domains, perform migrations, etc etc. But what’s next? What are some higher positions that I can aim to get into? Why are some things that I SHOULD learn in my free time to improve? 
 I feel like I’ve hit a road block, I do all those things and I code and develop websites on the side, but I’m not sure where the road takes me from here. Especially that I’m currently not very happy at my current position and was advised by a lot of you here to find another position, especially one that gives me better vacation days per year. 
 My ultimate goal is to be happy, and to be fully remote/WFH. I’d like to hear it from the wise ones what they think I should do to improve and reach my goals. What did you do to reach your goals? 
 On a side note, should I get a university degree? I dropped out 8 years ago and became a commercial aircraft pilot, but due to the pandemic and the Grindy nature of the industry, I reverted back into tech. The only credentials I have for my field is my experience, tech savviness and my Network+ cert. 
 Cheers!

 I'll be up front and honest that I'm not that great at all with Azure AD, I do more front-line and hardware support, but I've been given a project to get MFA implemented for a client company due to Microsoft switching off basic authentication globally. 
 The plan was originally to enable MFA for all of the users, with small batches being done on a daily basis but I've found out this evening that 80+ manufacturing users that work on the factory floor can't use mobile phones for health & safety rules, so that throws out using MS Authenticator App.
 I know from the initial reading of the various guides online, that there is the possibility of using conditional access but I'm not 100% sure how to get this setup, as all of the systems onsite use a single DHCP scope so setting it up for a specific IP address range wouldn't be a viable option.
 Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated, and if I find a solution myself I'll update my post. :-)

 ​
  (Internet) | | Alicloud (I would like to have the EIP here) EIP: 8.208.20.138 8.208.20.138 | ^ VM (DHCP) | +-------------------+ +----VM Hetzner---+ |IPv4: 192.168.60.89| <--- wireguad ---> | IPv4: Public IP | |IPv6: 240b:4005::30| | IPv6: Public /64| +-------------------+ +-----------------+ 
 The Alicloud instance, via DHCP, acquires a private IP class B (192.168.60.89) that is mapped to the public elastic IP 8.208.20.138, but it has a valid routable IPv6 address the one I use to create a wireguard tunnel to the VM in Hetzner.
 If I remove the private IP from the Alicloud instance ip addr del 192.168.60.89 dev eth0 I can't ping any more the public EIP (8.208.20.138) as expected, but still ipv6 is up and running thus the wireguard tunnel, from the one I one to route all the ipv4 traffic. In this Alicloud instance, I have proxy_arp and ip_forward 
 I am stuck figuring out how to route the traffic from the EIP to the VM in hetzner.
 Any ideas?
 The reason for doing this is to use servers with cheaper bandwidth or better connectivity to some regions, I am aware of the BCP38, but first, need to solve the routing problem, especially when not having the public IP bonded to the instance.

 can any one help me please
 So in a normal case we type reddit.com the browser (after DNS ) will:
  
-> establish a tcp connection then tls handshake ,in the handshake the broweser will receive a certificate from the reddit with a trusted CA ,then he will send the request to the server with the server ip address and the his src ip address 
  
​
  
now in the case of proxy :I'm still in doubt which one is correct (a root certificate of the proxy is already installed )
  
1-> the browser will establish a tcp connection with the proxy and also a tls handshake with the proxy but the certificate that he will get is the certificate of the proxy, 
 then the browser will verify the certificate(but here the browser will get a certification != that contain a domain not requested ?)
 and he can send a request https to the proxy -> the proxy will look at the request and
 then he will establish the connection with the server
 ​
 2->the browser will establish a tcp connection with the proxy and also a tls handshake with the proxy but the certificate that he will get is the certificate of the website but with the proxy as ROOT CA (how can the proxy know the website ?)
 the browser will verify the certificate(he will think that is the real website?) and he can send the http request (which ip address AS destination ?) the proxy will get the request and establish a connection with the server 
 ​
 please feel free to ask for clarification or even give me a deep explanation of the topic also if you know any resource I'm more than happy to learn

 So the business I am working for is deciding to actually put money into their IT department. By all means, go get your socks that have now been blown off. 
 One of the first things we did was provide E3 licenses to all our users. Another SysAdmin took charge of making all our machines hybrid joined to azure so that's neat. Months later though, an overwhelming majority of our devices are still Windows Pro. 
 The fix we found is going through Settings -> System -> Shared Experiences, seeing that there are problems with the user's account, and clicking "fix now" which prompts them for MFA and then huzzah, sorted. 
 So far this has been an incredibly manual process and I was wondering if we could have a thread sharing experiences with getting computers to Enterprise?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on some security automation and standardizing documentation of our zones (and subnet descriptions). Basically tackling this from two angles:
 Hierarchal Tags Zones:
  
Trusted 
 Client
 Datacenter 
 Server
 File Server
 
 DMZ 
 Shared
 Jump Host
 
 
 Untrusted 
 Vendor 
 VPN
 Jump Host
 
 IoT
 DMZ 
 External
 Internal
 
 
  
non Hierarchal Zone Tags:
  
firewall instance (ie, tag for all zones behind firewall)
 Geo (may make this a parallel hierarchal tag)
 Behind firewall (from default gateway perspective)
 Not behind firewall (this actually wouldn't be tagged directly. Technically everything is behind a firewall from an edge perspective. It would be NOT "Behind Firewall" AND "firewall instance" per firewall")
  
I'm having a hard time coming up with a good name for the Tag "Behind Firewall". basically we have some of the untrusted zone behind firewalls...the "Untrusted" is the dmz's or whatever that are behind the firewall, segmented from the general corporate network (client, datacenter), but we also have some "Trusted" zones behind theses same firewalls. as we get further into segmenting, I imagine "Trust" and "Untrust" will get more muddled from a network/routing perspective. I want a tag that does not reference the trust or anything security related. I just want to tag it from a network routing perspective (ie, this subnet is behind a firewall). I can use other tags to define the firewall, geo, function, etc etc.
 Any thoughts? I'm considering "Segmented", "Firewalled", "Behind" (not seriously)...but none of these are as elegant and descriptive as the function based tags.
 Also interested in other ideas of how to organize complex zones.

 Do I need RDS CAL or User/Device CAL licencing to add user to that domain? From what I've read, it should be User/Device CAL, but I just wanted to be sure, I'm on the right track. 
 Aditionally, I've googled with no success, the process to install said licences, any pointer regarding that, will be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I know what QinQ is in theory, C-Tag, S-Tag. 4096 VLANs with a single outer tag, scalability etc etc. But I've bit seen it in production. I'm about to move into a wholesale only ISP where I'm guessing this is going to be quite a thing as they grow.
 This is where my heads currently at, and I'd like any corrections/input into why we would use this.
 Let's say we have a wholesale customer with 6000 subscribers. Each on their own VLAN. 1-4096 get an S-Tag of 1. 4096-6000 get an S-Tag of 2. As this wholesale customer grows, we provision more S-Tags per block of 4096 customers?
 What happens as the company becomes massive, national scale. 4096*4096 is still a scalability limit, especially when one customer may get a second S-Tag and only need it for an additional 100 customers, wasting a chunk of space.
 Maybe I'm thinking about this all wrong, hopefully one of you can out this straight for me :)

 Excuse the text wall. Posting from a throwaway account. TIA for all replies!
 I’m hoping for some advice regarding a job I am in the process of interviewing for. I’m currently a field service technician with only about 9 months of experience servicing copiers/printers. The job I have made it to the second round for is a System Administrator role at a business with a 4 person IT team. I only have the Google cert and some virtual home lab experience. Did help desk in college about 8 years ago (unrelated bachelor’s degree). I haven’t lied or even really embellished my experience/qualifications. 
 The pay seems on the low end for the role, only about a dollar more than I’m a making now. The hours are also weird. However, it seems like a great place to gain experience and learn. Any advice on if offered whether or not to take it? I can provide more context if needed. I guess I’ll burn that bridge when I get to it.

 Looking at a high performance (cpu/mem) server for our memory intensive database. Previously ran this on rock solid IBM POWER pSystem platforms but the vendor decided to drop support for big blue.
 On the Intel X86_X64 side, looking for something solid from a reputable vendor, I have hands-on experience with commodity Dell PE R7xx servers that we use in a VMware cluster, and while they perform well for running commodity VMs - I am on the fence and looking at what other options are out there.
 Dell has the R940 in a 4-socket configuration, and HPE has ProLiant DL560 that is configurable in a 4-socket build.
 In researching, it appears Cisco has a UCS line of hardware, anyone have hands-on experience with these? How is their reliability and support compared to HPE/Dell?

 A bit about me:
  
Network engineering summer internship at a company in an unrelated sector.
 Bsc from a Russel Group University.
 Some experience, through my own projects, in BGP (Traffic engineering, route filtering) Multicast (PIM-SM), OSPF (multi area). Network Automation (OOP Python, Pytest, Go).
  
I've reached the final interview stages. 
 What is the salary range I should be asking for? US firms (Chicago, NYC) seem to pay $150k+ and higher for more experienced engineers. I couldn't really find much info for London.
 While this is early career advice, I don't think it breaks rule 5, r/networking is probably the best place to ask for HFT career advice.

It's oftentimes 30MBs up and 70 down, or 60MBs up and 40MBs down just for example. It equals out to 1000mbps (100MBs roughly) but never both up and down.
 The cables are Cat6 so throughput should be WAY over 1000mbps up and down but that doesn't seem to be the case.

 I tried to execute "traceroute" to see where is the problem but on PC on VLAN 30 when I traceroute reaches the Router interface IP 10.10.10.101 = Gi0/1.40 (yes, a subinterface because is neccesary in order to PC on VLAN 40 to be able to communicate with any PC on the network).
 Below, the traceroute and the ping to the Router works with no problem but if I ping 192.168.0.8 (the dhcp IP on the top Router connecting with Internet) and works so I don't know what is the problem and I don't understand why it doesn't work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! 
 I'm currently doing 2nd line support and my manager has suggested I gain exposure of the company IT Infrastructure. To get involved with jobs that the Infrastructure Engineer would normally be doing. 
 So the infrastructure is on-premise and it is stuff like Dell EMC, Cisco Switches and Firewalls, VMware V-Sphere and a few other things which I can't remember from the top of my head. 
 Just recently I was able to get involved with a Switches and Firewalls upgrade project. It was myself, the Infra guy and NOC guy. I was assisting (with guidance) in installing the new hardware, running new cabling and testing the services that were working once the upgrade was complete. The actual upgrade bit was carried out mainly by the NOC guy and the Infra guy making sure that Servers/VMs were powered down/up and it's all good after the upgrade.
 That being said, I am seeking advice on this community on what courses I can study myself to get a better understanding of the role and aid me when hands on.
 Thank you and sorry in advance.

 What I can't seem to find specific details on are the reqs for the client cert itself, beyond having to be issued by the CA of the cert that is loaded into the meraki config.
 Does the cert have to be tied to any unique properties of the workstation (i.e. its name etc)? If so I assume we'll have to go through sorting out a gpo to trigger autoenrollment for each machine. Ideally (at least for the moment) we'd like to avoid that and simply use a certutil script to push a pfx of a cert from our CA to the selected workstations' personal computer store.
 Will this work or are there unique properties the cert has to have/match on the workstation?
 Thanks!

 Lovely backscatter.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a set of applications on physical hardware that was stood up about 8 years ago - it has now come to the crunch point where this must be replaced, and I am tasked with virtualising the majority of it.
 It was all put on physical hardware at the time, because there was hardware purchased for another project that got cancelled, and it was up for grabs. It is pretty much all massively overspecced.
 I am now trying to figure out the sizing for ESXi VMs that I will need to replace these.
 I have Xymon (fka Hobbit) monitoring in place with stats going back 576 days which measures CPU, Memory, disk usage (among other things)
 I was thinking of basing my VMs on the peak values measured for these figures over the last 576 days, but a bit nervous since a lot of the values are tiny compared to the physical values.
 Especially since we have guideline sizings for virtual servers of this type which are massively above my measured values.
 What would be best practice here?
 Do you think these guidelines being rather large are to cope with potential spikes in usage we may see?
 An example, with CPU being the biggest problem here:
 My measured peak physical values CPU load 4 Mem 32GB
 My existing physical server CPU cores 16 Mem 64GB
 Reccommended VM sizing CPU cores 16 Mem 64GB

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been tasked to build data center storage for cheap but needs to be highly performant.
 The trouble I am having is coming up with the right combination and sweet spot for size, performance and overall cost and I thought this group is the right place to start asking the questions. Any help is appreciated, or kindly redirect me to the right place to ask the question (sorry if this is the wrong sub)
 Let me lay down some of the project's conditions:
  
We want our own hardware, colo is ok (no using BackBlaze etc)
 We need to buy/rent cabinet
 Factor in network costs with a 10GE ISP connection, no egress costs
 Include elictricity use
 Include OSS storage software
 Hybrid NVME/SSD and HDD
 Total size of storage should be at least 20TB, preferably 80-100TB minimum, max 500TB
 Total cost per TB needs to be less than $2 per month over 3 years.
 
 For example, a $10k server, plus $2k running costs per year on a 100TB server comes in at $36k for 3 years. 100/36 = $2.7 per TB over 36 months
 The above has way more costs, I just wanted to give an example. The goal is $2 or under per TB. 
 Any help is appreciated.

 Since then he has been a complete thorn in my supervisor's and mine side; update business critical software / created downtime without notifying our Tech director (update caused a critical API client to fail, ended up causing weekend work plus multiple tickets into the sofrware vendor), buildout systems / updates system in the incorrect order (leaving us to try to figure out why the systems are not working), hording of information has gotten worse (our director had to force him to start handing it over), he only renewed our TLS wildcard cert for 1 year (it takes 3 days, plus a week of bouncing emails between people to get the downtime lined up/approved with over departments, to update all of our systems)... It's been like this since he put in his retirement papers, and is getting worse.
 We tried to reason with him on some of these thing, like giving the devs 24hrs notice when we update there OS & software stacks on dev environments, got shot down on that one (the old "it's just dev not production, we can do it at anytime").
 It's almost to the point where we have to monitor what he does, sysadmin task wise, on every system.
 At this point kinda at a loss on how to handle this gently; supervisor and I still have to work with him for another 8 weeks, our Tech Director is at a loss too and is almost willing to pull our COO & CEO in to talk with him, worst part is he is the only IT manager that we have had (he has been here for 25 years).
 Where would you start with this mess?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have a preestablished 2008 DFL/FFL domain contoso.com, on-prem, with 4 AD sites, 3 being physical locations, one being Azure.
 There are 3 DCs at our main location (2x 2008, 1x 2008 R2), 1 DC each at our satellite offices.
 We have a S2S tunnel set up between our main location and our single Azure network.
 I connect via VPN to our the router in our main office.
 Today, I stood up a Win2022 Azure Edition DC and put NPS (configured it for RADIUS for VPN auth) on it. That's literally it. No other changes were made.
 Shortly after, I started to be unable to RDP into any of our on-prem Win2008/R2 servers or any Win7 machines that were domain-joined. If I try with Win10 mstsc, I get "Your credentials did not work (the login attempt failed)"
 If I try using RDP on the Win2022 DC, I get "An internal error has occurred. Error code 0x4, extended error code 0x0."
 The hilarious bit is I can RDP into an on-prem WinXP VM sitting on a VMware hypervisor, and RDP from there to any of the on-prem machines I'm having trouble with. I can also RDP into any domain-joined VMs in Azure.
 I am completely stumped. Initially I thought NLA settings might somehow have changed on the on-prem servers, but I just checked one and it's set for lax NLA.
 Event viewer shows NOTHING. No persistent DFSR issues, nothing.
 dcdiag comes back clean on all DCs aside from irrelevant System log entries.
 UPDATE: It just started happening to the Azure DC as well, but it told me it was NLA, so I went and set SecurityLayer and UserAuthentication keys to 0 at HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp using Remote Registry, and voila, I can now log on to an affected server.
 Obviously I'd prefer not to leave NLA off, any idea what might be causing this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Are online offsite / emergency backups realistic once they grow past a certain size ?
 We are evaluating encrypting and storing 200Tb of data with Backblaze. We would do the encryption on our side and just upload it...it would take 2-3 months!
 So that begs the question, in case of disaster, if we need the data back, it will also take 2-3 months to download. Seems unrealistic.
 How do you guys handle the transfer of such amounts of data and/or the backup ?

Each suit has it's own ISP connection and a Meraki MX and one AP since they have only 5 end uses at each suit. The vendor is looking to cancel one of the ISP connections since it's costing them over $1,000. They are also not allowed to run cables across the hallway per building policy, I am thinking the best solution would be install 2 bi-directional AP just enough coverage to provide wireless connectivity to another suit.

I got about a week of training and have been learning on the job while still handling my previous responsibilities. Today we had my first setup where I was running point on adding new hosts and storage in a remote location. It had a few bumps in the road but at the end of the day I was able to migrate a VM to the new host and storage with no downtime! It was an awesome feeling when I saw the VM migrating to the new compute and storage with no interruption of service. It feels really good when it works.

 What I'm trying to do: curl http://78.141.424.78/test -X POST -H "Content-Type": 'application/json' -d '{"test": "data"}' 
 With verbose this returns

 When I SSH to my server and do the same, it works. And I receive the test data. Pinging works from inside my server when I SSH. Ping does not work from outside my server, it just hangs. (from my normal terminal) 
 What I have tried: I have made sure to open port 80 via firewall settings on my VPS.

But over the past few years it has abated to the point that I have no motivation. I currently work for an MSP. I have been working here for 5 years, I am the top "tech". I am the guy that basically everyone goes to it they cant figure something out. I try to keep motivated to keep myself going but it just doesn't work anymore. I get snappy at people at work. Or just get agitated about stuff that use to I would just brush off.
 I also feel stagnant like I haven't grown as a tech in a couple of years. 
 I to somehow rekindle that spark and fire outside of work but nothing helps. Hell I have a few programming projects that are in some state of in progress, but when I attempt to start working on them I just cant. Hell even video games don't really interest me anymore. Use to I could hop on a game all weekend. Now I can't stay interested for more than 30 minutes.
 What have I lost in this respect and how to I get it back?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for thoughts for IPAM. I currently run 4 separate networks at my org and looking for IPAM for 2 of them. 
 Network A is "open" internet connected, running SNOW, DNAC. has about a thousand clients (wired and wireless) and maybe 500 servers.
 Network B is dark, and nothing in it should require the Internet. Comprised of 3x /16's running bgp, mpls, mesh devices across the operating area.
 Let's pretend money is no object, and support is critical. I've seen Netbox on prem briefly and am less than impressed; Infoblox has me curious so far. I also don't need the same system for both networks.
 Edit : minor clarifications

I want to know how these physical mediums are shared or not shared and how the ISP manages that. 
 I know a lot just comes from experience in the game or may be propreitary, but I'm hoping for books, youtube channels, etc. And if there are specific certifications I could look into, Im down for it. I know there was a CCNP or CCIE service prodiver cert which Ill look more into after this post.

 20 techs, spread over 16 states, a QUOTA of 13 tickets that need to be done a day. Below are the job responsibilities:
 -User account access, control, setup, and administration
 -Device deployments
 -Setting up MDFs for new sites; switches, servers, panels, cabling, punchdowns, as well as all config.
 -All basic desktop support tickets (printers, phones, cameras, user level issues, etc)
 -Software deployments, reinstalls, configurations
 All of this, plus basic help desk troubleshooting and remote reinstalls, troubleshooting, etc.
 For less than 25/hr.
 And needing to travel within a 6 hour radius to support other sites as needed.
 To me this raises huge red flags as a current Desktop Support dude who does, ya know, just desktop support stuff. This job looks like id be doing a sysadmin, netadmin, desktop, and help desk role for half the pay of what an admin would make.
 Plus a ticket QUOTA? I get SLAs and uptime. But quota? Is it just me or does this raise red flags to anyone else?

Have it on my Windows 10 machine and discovered its now on by default for Windows 11 and the users. That's fine, I can use it then. But whenever you try to run it as admin you get an error. Was doing the same on my Windows 10 machine. Why? It would appear its because it needs to be installed on the account you're trying to "runas".
 Anyone else get this issue? If I then login a laptop that gets the error as my domain admin, install Terminal for that account. Next time I'm logged on as the user and run Terminal as admin, it works fine.

Officially, I've been a Systems Administrator for 8 years and have been in IT for about 20 years. I am burned out, my boss is an asshole, I am underpaid, and over worked. I won't say where I work but I will say it's a state government agency. Some of you might know how difficult it may be in these kinds of environments with low budgets to work in. Anyway, I want to leave this place so I am looking for a new remote job. I finished a cloud computing program and learned AWS and Azure. It seems the best chance for me to land a new position is another Sys Admin role but one that utilizes cloud technologies. 
 I am slated to take my AWS solutions architect exam next month. I am having a heck of a time landing a new job despite many positions constantly getting posted. I don't know guys...2022 has been brutal for me. My wife had cancer and is a victim of medical malpractice. I support my family and I'm tired of living paycheck to paycheck. I will probably post my resume over at r/sysadminresumes because I can't afford a professional resume service. (they're stupid expensive). I guess I'm just venting. My mental health is shot. Sorry for the rant. I just feel like crying.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Well folks, I've officially broke production it seems. I inherited a very broken Enterprise PKI, and in an attempt to get it to re-publish the CDP Location and DeltaCRL location, I renewed the root cert. 
 I was sure to not generate a new public / private key pair. However after making that change users were no longer able to update group policy facing an error saying: "...processing of Group Policy failed because of lack of connectivity to a domain controller..." and "... Windows could not authenticate to the Active Directory service on a domain controller. (LDAP Bind function call failed)..."
 Upon looking at gpresult, it shows a few errors including: "The system call to get account information completed. The call failed after 0 milliseconds" and "Error: Retrieved account information. Error code 0x5." and "The processing of Group Policy failed. Windows could not resolve the computer name..."
 DNS appears to be fine, and the computers are able to ping the DC's, and the domain itself with no issue. Looking at the DC's logs, there are many Kerberos-Key-Distribution-Center errors saying "While processing an AS request for target service krbtgt, the account {laptop_name} did not have a suitable key for generating a Kerberos ticket (the missing key has an ID of 1). The requested etypes : 18. The accounts available etypes : 23 18 17. Changing or resetting the password of {laptop_name} will generate a proper key."
 ​
 I'd really appreciate any tips or help you folks can offer. So far people have just been unable to update group policy, but I bet authentication issues are close to follow due to the cached credentials. We're likely on borrowed time.

 We are building up a network segmentation with VLAN's and a NAC sollution (everything Aruba). Our main switches are secured in IT rooms or closed network closet. So we can secure these switches and ports. 
 ​
 But in different area's we don't have sufficiënt cabling so we have to use "desk" switches. Now we found models for these "desk" switches that are capable and working with 802.1x authentication to properly set the correct VLAN at the correct port. 
 Now comes my problem; the uplink port/cable is not secured and the next upward switch port allows tagged VLAN traffic. So basically if anyone brings in a VLAN cabable switch (or in worst case resets the desk switch) is able to bypass the 802.1x security. 
 ​
 Is their any way to detect and block these rogue switches on these uplink ports? (We are an engineering company with people whom are well capabel of dooing this, and as IT we want to be one step a head of this).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently deployed a F5 LTM load balancer to front some Atlassian applications. It seem to be working correctly, but the overall performance is considerably slower than going direct to the services themselves. We are not proxying any SSL. Just a straight tcp connection to the pool servers. The LTM is setup in a one arm mode, hanging off the same firewall as the servers are behind, so the traffic is flowing through the same path, whether it is direct or load balanced.
 Any thoughts?

 l2vpn xconnect group test1 p2p traffic_a interface HundredGigE0/0/0/20.22 interface HundredGigE0/0/0/30.22 ! p2p group traffic_b interface HundredGigE0/0/0/21.44 interface HundredGigE0/0/0/31.44 ! ! 
 Then only traffic from those sub interfaces can communicate with each p2p connection. This works well but I cant figure out how to do the same in Junos. I think I need to create a pvlan aka private-vlans.
 I think I create sub interfaces that tag on the vlan ids I want, then create two sperate private-vlans for the traffic correct?
 If anyone can create some examples that would be helpful. QFX ports I am working with are 
 xe-0/0/20.22 <-> xe-0/0/30.22 xe-0/0/21.44 <-> xe-0/0/31.44

How do you cope everyday with waking up and doing the same thing over and over again for the sake of money, when all you really want is to be able to play Elden Ring in your underwear and go grab an ice cream in the middle of the week in the midst of day with your girlfriend and then get in a car and travel on a road trip if your heart desires?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a design question only, and not specific to a current hardware implementation - this is educational (for me) only
 Say you have a small business that has Internet access. It has a router and a firewall. The firewall is multi-homed, connecting to the Internet router, the internal LAN and has an interface supporting a DMZ. You have a public facing Web server on the DMZ. You have a ERP server on the DMZ. 
 Now you want to provide remote access, so you are looking to install an IPSec VPN server. I am assuming the VPN server would be connected to the DMZ. Say you used Cisco AnyConnect or Palo Alto Global Connect, or even OpenVPN - would you port forward from the firewall to the VPN server on the VPN? Say the VPN server has two interfaces. Would one connect to the DMZ and the other to the internal LAN? Or would you get a separate WAN connection and use that for connecting to the VPN server?
 So router --> firewall --> VPN Server on DMZ --> where does this connect?

 I have about a dozen licenses, charged at $16.99 billed monthly on an annual contract.
 Went to add another one and it jumped from $16.99 to $23.99, looks like either the price just increased across the board, or they split the tiers, because now Adobe Acrobat Standard is $14.99 vs. Pro which is now $23.99.
 Review the feature list here to see if you really need to stay on Pro come renewal: Business pricing & plans | Enterprise licenses | Adobe Acrobat 
 I will be downgrading all my licenses at renewal because it is absolutely not worth the extra cost for those handful of extra features (at least in my use case).
 Hopefully this saves a few people from getting auto locked into a new contract at the higher price unexpectedly.

 I currently have an application web server in my DMZ. The server has every port on and is closed off from the internet, but it still can't access files on the application server it's based off of. The DNS requests it is sending are timing out. DNS and firewalls are not my speciality, I'm a hardware guy that got pushed into a sole admin job. So I do not know the most secure way to give a DMZ server access to DNS requests and SMB requests so that it can access the files that it needs to. This is the only server inside the DMZ other than the firewall interface itself. It's a Palo alto firewall as well. 
 Once the DNS requests can finish out I can packet sniff to find the exact ports I need to be able to run it, but I can't do that with out that DNS requests finishing out. 
 ALSO: important! *** If anyone works in dental laboratory technology they would know exactly what application web server I'm trying to setup as it is a standard in the industry and could probably help way better based off of the way they set up theirs. Though any general knowledge of this stuff would most likely help. 
 Thanks! TeethandTechnology.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I swear I have tried to search for hits on this topic (here on Reddit and also via Google) and keep coming up empty. I have a situation in which a company is asking me how much I would charge them to have my certification status registered under them. Basically, they need someone in their corporate account that is holding three different technical certifications that I have or can get fairly easily (all three certs are very much my main focus in IT for the past 15+ years.). A friend of mine has told me that a colleague we both have in common will often do this for 5K for a 12 month agreement. I have heard of even higher numbers, which is mind boggling to me. But, as my friend explained, because incentives and sales discounts are often predicated on what status a company holds with a major vendor, these expenses of borrowing someone's certification status will often pay for themselves in very short time. I guess I am simply trying to understand what is reasonable based on the experience of others in here. Also, anything I should think about before agreeing to do this? Open to all feedback!

 Thought popped into my head today...I advertise an IPv4 /16 to the world. We get a lot of trash at our doorstep....by that I mean port scanners and whatnot.
 But it's easy to enumerate IPv4. There's only so many IP's. 65,536, to be exact, in a /16.
 Is this such a problem in IPv6? We have a /40 and haven't started advertising any of it yet.
 There's a few more IP address in a /40 ( 309,485,009,821,345,068,724,781,056) than in a /16. It seems like trying to scan/sweep an address space that large would be futile. Are scanners even bothering to try?

 I have seen a few from Kramer that can be customised. If anyone is familiar with them or has used them I would be very keen to hear if they are worth their price as they do seem costly.
 My other concern would be that we use UK-type plugs that are quite a bit larger than US ones. Kramer does have universal power sockets. But this raises another concern
 The cable for UK plugs exits from the bottom of the plug while US cables generally exit from the back of the plug (Opposite to the socket) therefore the cable can get in the way.
 Any help would be appreciated
 The Kramer items I am looking at are here:

So, when the HDD's have been sleeping, there is a significant delay until the default WebMin page shows up, because probably the process is blocked until the HDD spins up and returns the information.
 Can I make WebMin not spin up sleeping HDD's? Not until I specifically request up-to-date HDD status information or something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 what is the cheapest and best way to store large amounts of company data? And with large amount, I mean roughly 700GB which I know some of you probably laugh about, but for our company that is the limit and my employer does not want to just buy more memory and I have to somehow make room for new data right now. The data right now is stored on a terminal server within a cloud and I don't know their price models but apparently it is kinda expensive to upgrade memory i guess.
 I have never engaged with data storage, backups or archiving before so I have no experience. We have the options of theoretically buying and installing our own backup server as we still have a lot of room in our server rack. Alternatively we could use some cloud option but I have the feeling that we would pay too much for something very simple. 
 Also which OS would you use to make it simple and efficient? Is there some kind of linux distribution specializing in data backups/ archives? 
 ​
 Thanks in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to include the content of the aforementioned folders in a timeshift snapshot on a machine with only CLI, so that the snapshot contains everything you would need to setup the machine again.
 What I tried is to add  "exclude" : [ "+ /home/user1/**", "+ /root/**", "+ /home/user2/**", ],  to /etc/timeshift.json as per this post but the files within those folders still aren't included in the backup.
 Just in case this is an XY problem, are there other ways to reprovision a machine with a previous configuration with little to no interaction.
 Thanks in advance for your replies and best regards

 I'm currently auditing AD accounts for a customer.n The customer has over 1,000 servers and several thousand AD accounts, specifically functional accounts, some were created over 15 years ago.
 So probably somebody could answer those question:
  
We have several accounts that don't have a last logon time stamp. Is it save to assume that those can be disabled / deleted? Or is there a scenario where they are still used for something but don't get this time stamp?
 
We have accounts that are used as group mailboxes / resources. Can I disable them and they could still be used by people who have the right delegated?
 
 Thanks

 The hacker did following
 1: Got user password
 2: Bypass the 2FA, seems user click yes is me by mistake (We disable this new 2FA system of office 365)
 3: In the email with wire they include the user correct number, the bank call to the legit owner phone and somebody pick up and confirm wire - This is the part I don't understand how in hell they did it. We called the phone provider and got a new sim, but they said they have no idea how it is possible, because is not the hacker did not get his number port or similar.
 How is it possible the hacker got hacked and intervene his phone calls? His Iphone is not jailbroken, so my understanding is that it is very difficult to hack it but even if they install something, are you able to pick up certain calls? 
 The phone provider reset account password and pin, but I don't think the fixes it anything. 
 This seems very sophisticated.

 I run various related business functions— I attacked things that were disorganized and forced them into order. People see me as a voice of authoritah.

 I only have one IP route set, 172.16.1.0/24, with the gateway marked as direct (ends in .254), I've only got the one switch, no stacking is enabled and it's a fresh firmware image yet again with no luck. 
 It's got to be something simple, I just need someone to actually point me to the right thing.

In the office they have USB-C docks with large dual monitor setups.
 The Head of BDM hired a graphic designer part time 3 days per week. Requested a MacBook Pro and I said no for many reasons. Gave the designer Creative Cloud on a X1 Carbon G10 with the same specs as above.
 However, after a couple of months again they are agitating for a MAcBook. She said "Person A is finding that is a little inefficient to use the PC for graphic design".
 I understand that some people think they are really cool and special individuals to use a Mac, but is there really a major advantage to using it for graphic design?

 We have a Win11 Pro environment and am testing upgrades to Win11 as well as new deployments.
 I have been successful in implementing policies to remove the Chat, Widgets icon etc but the last thing I can't figure out is the unholy amount of bloat apps pinned to the start menu by default. TikTok, ClipChamp, Amazon Prime etc. 
 These apps are not technically installed, but install once clicked without any MS Account etc. I want to remove all of these apps except the relevant Windows apps (Notepad, Settings, etc etc) from the start menu pinned section. 
 I need this to work for existing user profiles. Happy to run a script or change registry keys to remove this stuff. We are not an environment that uses MS Edge, Teams, etc. 
 I have attempted to edit XMLs and JSON start layouts to no success. I was able to edit the start layout to remove most of these apps but this only worked for new profiles and even then, ClipChamp and Xbox kept appearing despite being removed. 
 ​
 Thanks in advance for any guidance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR; at the bottom. 
 So I’ll give more information than I usually do about myself. I’d studied network engineering which has been my goal for years. I was hired on by Dell before I finished my courses and decided to dedicate myself to their company. The job became fully remote and I started going nuts around 6 years. It was fun at first but man, I just need people around me. 
 I had experience with network engineering from reading the bulky books but hardly anything was applied experience because I was hired on with Dell. I tried to segue into enterprise but even after years it was difficult to get in. I learn best by doing things, reading just doesn’t stick. I was outperformed by many who were smart as a whip. 
 I’ve left Dell and landed a job at Charter/Spectrum - this is my first week. I feel totally lost as I’ve forgotten many things. I’ve been working on client computers for so long that it’s all I know. I plan to utilize the offers for CCNA and JDCNA to get back on my path but for now I’m focused on just kicking ass through my training. 
 My main question is which areas to focus on in an enterprise tech support role here (I’m being trained on many things I don’t have experience with). The CLI for now is superputty and I’m trying to use my CMD and PS experience as much as possible. To be honest though I’m just a little intimidated. 
 TLDR; Hired into enterprise customer support. Hoping for suggestions on what to learn after I clock out daily. I’m looking for network engineering or cloud admin areas. My new company doesn’t have 1x1 type meetings to assess career paths. I’ll read anything y’all suggest, thanks guys.

The total lack of appreciation by everyone. Constant context switching while having to work both 3rd like help desk tickets while also being responsible for projects. I’m looking forward to working in a larger org where I’m not “the guy” for absolutely everything.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for an MSP and have a client who is having a really strange issue. So far I've seen it happen 3 times, though I'm hearing reports there may be more.
 They get random emails from gmail addresses that look like this. I don't know if its only gmail, but all three examples I've seen so far have been. https://imgur.com/a/l77h7oh
 This is a legit email for the client. The odd thing is that when I check their anti-spam logs (they use Barracuda ESS) I can see the message there looks fine, and can even download a copy where the original message is in tact.
 Has anyone seen anything like this before? Kind of stumped. They use Office 365 for their email in a hybrid setup. On-prem Exchange server is running Exchange 2016 CU22.

 I have a Sonicwall TZ300, and I want to connect that to the MR6400 to provide internet to the entire office. Normally, the Sonicwall would connect to an Openreach vdsl modem. Our fibre lines have been destroyed by some construction workers.
 I'm not great with networking, and I can't figure out the correct way to do this. I've got a 4G USB dongle arriving tomorrow which will do the same thing, so if I can't get this figured out today it'll just have to wait until then.
 So far, I've assigned a static IP to one of the TZ300's interfaces and connected that to a LAN port of the MR6400, in the same subnet. (192.168.1.0/24) I've tried to create a static route on the Sonicwall to route all traffic to the MR6400 (source/destination any, default gateway the IP of the MR6400)
 I'm very much out of my depth here. How can I use the MR6400 purely as a modem for the TZ300?

Issue is, I can't find any info if there are any compatibility issues with replication (DFS/AD) to an older version. We currently have 4 other sites which are on 2012/2012R2 for now.
 Also noticed the upgrade path can now go 2012 > 2022 directly, anyone had experience of how well this goes?

However it will happen again a few times throughout the day. All affected users are using different models of Dell latitude
 We have tried the below troubleshooting but in most cases it doesn't make a difference.
  
office quick repair
 office online repair
 updating all reccomended drivers from Dell support assist
 reinstalling office
 dism restore health followed by sfc scannow until no errors are found
 reset PC
  
In many cases resetting the PC fixes it but not all cases. One common denominator is that all the users experiencing this are using docking stations with an ethernet connection. Not sure if this can affect anything but it is a common denominator so it may be worth mentioning.
 Could anyone perhaps point me in the right direction of how I could troubleshoot this? This issue seems to be unique to one of the many clients we support so it must be something in their environment that is causing it

 If I want to do a password recovery, is it possible to keep the old config or does it automatically restore default config as well as erase startup config?
 There is an option in the boot menu, "7. Skip current system configuration". But would be very bad if the startup/current config gets deleted.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone,
 So this post is specifically about Residential Proxy Providers who sell ISP proxies(sourced from ISPs), but all knowledge that can help is welcome.
 So, I feel there is a good demand for residential proxies in the proxy market. Most providers are resellers and there are only a handful of providers who actually own the infra and source and host the proxies themselves.
 From my research these ISP proxy providers get IPs from ISPs and then host the proxies themselves for which they need both hardware and software. the IPs are already announced on the ASN of the ISP which gives them the ISP type IP.
 Now, I have some questions about these handful of providers.
 ​
  
What kind of hardware do they own? How is the hardware mapped and how does it work together?
 Does the ISP give them access to a server that the ISP owns with the bought IPs connected?(some B2B providers sell like this)
 Or, do they need to have their own servers and they lay the cables from the ISP datacenter to their servers and host the proxies there?
 What software do they use to host? Is it the normal squid for http/https and dante for SOCKS? I'd assume they write their own software. So,
 What is the prerequisite knowledge to write that software? I suppose its socket programming(correct me if I am wrong).
 Lastly, What is the cost of the hardware for hosting lets say a /20? Both one time and periodic costs.
  
I am sorry if my questions aren't specific, but I would be really glad if you all could answer them in detail. Have a good day!

Since neither Cisco nor Palo officially support one another's SFPs, does this mean that as long as I use Cisco 10G-SFP-SR in the Cisco switch and I use Palo Alto PAN-SFP-PLUS-SR SFPs in the PA-850 that both devices will be fully supported by their respective TACs? I know, I know, OEM optics aren't worth it, bla, bla, bla. Just looking for insight on the TAC support.

 What I'm currently trying to do is enable window borders on our terminal server. I followed this tutorial. I created a new GPO and set it up, and then linked it to my "Domain RDS Servers" OU. But my real question comes down to the Security Filtering. I did not change it from the default "authenticated users". Do I need to add my Domain Users as well? When I do a Gpupdate and then Gpresult it does not show up as an Applied GPO.

Apps such as Teams, Slack and Policy-Pak will no longer run, but instead popup a blue box that says "This app has been blocked by your system administrator."
 I've seen a little bit of chatter about it online, but nothing on this forum unless I missed it. Here's a link: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1081649/administrator-restriction-after-install-kb5019959.html
 The applocker solution is worthless to us... applocker is not configured.
 Anyone else seeing this? Before we allow updates to go out to the whole org, we want to be sure there is some kind of fix for this.

 Is a new WSUS server the better option?
 My general patch guidelines:

On Saturday:
  
Install Zero-day and critical security patches Immediately
 Install Cumulative and optional updates 1 month after release.
 Install Feature updates (20H1, 20H2, etc ) about 3 months after release.

We are also trying to have more control/tracking of our scripts with version control, etc. What are others doing as far as running scripts (shell/bat and powershell) against several different servers/computers and environments from a central location (while having redundancy so the server can be rebooted or if there is an outage, etc).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m currently working in an IT consultancy company that aside for many other things, also provides support for Citrix related issues.
 I have never been drawn into anything Citrix related, and am currently trying to shift my focus into infosec as much as possible to eventually switch into that field permanently as I find it much more interesting and it’s something I really want to base my career on right now, probably related to redteaming and pentesting.
 However, until a security related team is formed in my current company, I still have to carry on with the regular sysadmin duties, and recently my supervisor has been nudging the more Citrix knowledgeable person to teach others the ropes of Citrix and one other topic I can’t discuss here, and he specifically said I should also know these things, and I just feel like I don’t want to become ’that guy’ for things I am not really interested in.
 Thus I come to you, /r/sysadmin, for guidance. Should I mention not wanting to get too deep into Citrix or keep my head down and do as I’m told? I work in Europe so worker’s rights are really good here and I doubt anyone would consider letting me go for saying such things (although I am on probation still), but I just don’t know how to handle this situation. All i want is to not become the go-to-guy for something I have no interest in.
 Maybe there is something I’m also missing about Citrix stuff? It just never seemed too interesting to me, I find other hypervisor platforms more interesting and fun to work with.

 I would change the security (remove the user group from the folder group in AD) but I know that isn't immediate, unsharing doesn't work as the folders are local from a RDS point of view (not best practice I know but budget and improved performance of said bad but vital software) 
 I'm thinking just rename the folder (or in this case because I shared the exact directory so a rename would remove the share, make a sub directory and re-point there during the upgrade, then I have an easy level to rename next time without breaking the share)

 I have pretty much no knowledge about networking but trying to fix a problem in work. We have a control unit on our furnaces which was connected to a laptop via Ethernet that displays all data and history on the program we use. The laptops battery has bulged massively so I’ve decided to rearrange the previous workers setup and I installed an ssd in the pc I use in here as well, hoping to run the program and work network all from the same pc. I bought a switch which both the network and furnace control unit are connected to. I’ve successfully managed to connect to the network but i cannot ping the control Unit. After reading a bit about switches I can understand the problem but no idea how to fix it. The unit has its completely separate ip address. I’m assuming when pinging, it’s trying to find the ip on the network. Is there anyway I can fix this and connect to the control unit ? 
 Thanks

 my boss asked me to do a cleanup of our backup structure. So there is one folder with many subfolders and countless files in it. So many that you can't even run ls anymore.
 I now need to clean this up somehow. Means i need to delete all files in all folders that exceed a certain fileage.
 What's the best way to do this? The folder itself is mounted into our filesystem from our NAS.
 I guess it will be best to do it on the NAS itself but i probably need to programm something myself, i have Python 2.7.5 available there or shell.
 ​
 But perhaps there is a better solution out there?

 (I'll also post thins in r/WindowsServer and r/WindowsServerAdmin in case any one have the answer)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Next May, we’ll be coming to a cliff-edge with full enforcement of strong certificate mapping.
 I know people reported issues of the new OID not issuing with offline templates (used by SCEP) which is used to plant the SID for strong mapping.
 I’m slightly concerned as I’m planning a few deployments with SCEP - and I’m not sure what the best way would be to ensure that strong mapping is met for device certificates (for HAADJ) and user certificates (for AADJ).
 At the moment, my go-to configs are:
  
Device certificates are issued with CN/SAN of {{DeviceName}}$@domain.local
 User certificates are issued with CN/SAN of {{UserPrincipalName}}
  
Obviously, these aren't going to be acceptable come May 2023 and Intune's certificate connector has no native capability to carry out the mapping.
 With it being pivotal for Wi-Fi and VPN authentication, I don’t envision it being a fun time for those who haven’t met the strong mapping criteria come May 2023. Disappointing Microsoft haven't addressed this six months on, especially when they are pushing people to AADJ which is heavily dependent on user certificates through SCEP for on-prem access.
 Anyone care to share their wisdom on the topic?
 Thanks.

 I've found one post on here where the OP installed more RAM but that can't be the fix can it?

 My boss asked me if it would be possible to create a ticketing system with database integration since we need to keep track of the support we offer to the customers when dealing with problems with the specialiced devices we sell. I basically need a ticketing system that can display data stored in our projects and clients database so when our support agents have to resolve something they can submit the ticket chosing in which project, client and device the issue has appearead, what caused it and how they solved it.
 i made a basic ticketing system for the IT department that works using forms and a few power automate flows, but something like this is not going to cut it for this project.
 I've checked some options like freshdesk which i've seen has integration with microsoft sql which is the DB engine we use, and seems pretty solid and intuitive, but I'd like to have a couple more options to compare and make a more informed decision.

 Google all I can and tested all I can think of… but with no luck, and the problem only occurs randomly. Computers are Win 10. 
 GPO for cached credentials is OK and if I remove all cached credentials, I can see that it cache when I sing in with a user.
 Tested to re-join a computer, same problem.
 Got the same problem on a new installed computer 
 Anyone have any tips or ideas what to do?

 I am trying to deploy scheduled tasks on my Windows Servers via GPO.
 But this only works if I specify "SYSTEM" account to run the task. When I specify any other user, the task is not created on the server.
 Is this a "standard" behavior and is it not possible to create task that will run with classic user ?
 I need to launch some tasks with a specific user because the script needs to access network ressources.
 It happens the same if I create a User GPO instead.
 Is it possible to create a scheduled task via GPO that runs as specific user ?

Ability to limit the internal servers that can submit messages.
 Route messages to different upstream SMTP servers depending on the address
 Have a GUI (if it's Linux based)
 An on-premise solution
  
I looked at the IIS relay in Windows Server but it can't achieve option 2 unless the server has multiple IP addresses (unless I have missed something!).
 We can't direct send over the internet unfortunately. We need an internal relay.

 How much work is it to maintain and secure a web server running for example multiple indie Ruby on Rails apps with Postgres?
 What if the data is sensitive? 
 Should I just pony up the $$ for a PaaS (often paid per project, which is the painpoint for me), or is it worth keeping my own server to be able to run basically infinite hobby projects on (unless they start scaling, but then I can always deal with that?).
 Back in 2005-ish I used to run and maintain a few servers on Hetzner (I'm in Europe). They just had my personal stuff, so I didn't stress too much about security, but tried to keep them semi up-to-date with aptitude (although I was quite often behind) and lately also using SSH keys. I don't know much more than that about running a server, to be honest, but I'm willing to learn if it's not too much work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 This isn't a bashing thread or anything like that. It is purely out of curiosity and idea gathering.
 So how do your company deal with new hires and people who leave?
 I wonder how other people do it, since our way is most definitely not the best or right way.
 This is our process for when they join:
  
The management hire a guy.
 The person is then added to salary list.
 The same day as the person starts, IT is informed that the person needs tons of equipment.
  
This is our process for when they leave:
  
Someone hears from someone, that X is no longer here.
 Economics gets informed about this.
 The employee gets removed from salary list.
 Sometimes months later, HR and IT gets informed about this.
  
We have tried to make a simple formular that asks all the right questions, that managers has to fill out when hiring a new guy. But often people forget to do it.
 We do not have such thing for when an employee leaves though. Not yet at least.
 ​
 My initial idea, was to add some sort of information message to managers, when I run my user disabling script.
 Or make some sort of formular, where it will send out an e-mail containing some basic information of the person quitting, so that it will trigger some script that will then run all the basics, and inform all the relevant people.
 Preferably a way where no one has to remember anything specific, other than maybe click a button.
 ​
 But I am not trying to get a discussion going on how bad we handle it, instead I am trying to get some ideas from other people in the same field. What is good? What works well? What is not recommended etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is clearly a trail of thoughts about the transition and the opportunities (not) from helpdesk to junior/mid admin. I’m not looking for “the answer” just want to rant about it because I had enough!
 By this time, I believe it’s almost impossible to make it, no matter what you do, no matter how hard you try, study or do things just to learn, either the companies or the “co-workers” trying to push back and pull you down.
 There’s clearly no way out of the hell of helpdesk and if they labeled you as a junior admin, you are just a glorified helpdesk with a global admin account to just reset password, formatting the workstations and update the god-damn antivirus or fixing the f*@#$ng printer!
 No matter what or how you study, pay for yourself online trainings or a Pluralsight or whatever, getting certified with new technologies, setting up a lab on your own, nothing matters as it seems.
 The companies want someone with 10years experience and be the one man show and pay him as a junior. The seniors “co-workers” just don’t want you to learn and mess around with their stuff even if you are doing it alright and actually helping them, even if you are hired to do system tasks, they throw you back on the helpdesk pit for the d2d, because “you are more experienced with that” and you'll endup doing something actual worth doing maybe once in a couple of weeks.
 And let me ask you, how should I be more experienced if you do not give me a proper task or a chance to learn and do some actual work on a corporate environment, even if I do correctly everything you ask so far no matter how big the task was?
 Is it too much to ask? Getting paid decent money and doing the work you suppose to do on the role they hired you?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've worked quite a lot with integrating things into the network at the edge, and by various business functions. It also seems to me that besides very different business functions at the edge, there can be various actors needing to operate at the edge for example either as different company entities under the same umbrella, different companies operating due to subcontracting or other business/organizational reasons.
 Just thought that it might be convenient to "virtualize" switches and assign a set of ports to adhere to different access control schemes or perhaps to completely act as isolated virtual switches, but within the same switch hardware to conserve resources.
 I've never heard of such implementations, but has anyone had similar thoughts or what kind of solutions do you usually go for in cases where shared hardware would be cost-effective but difficult to implement?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For me, that happened just now. Funny story time:
 A client I really like helping (they really appreciate the work I do for them) rings up in a bit of a flap. "i'm watching my emails disappearing in front of me, I think i've been hacked!"
 I say "OK, shut down and I'll check access logs". I check access logs, nothing other than his mobile and their IP. OK, not that then.
 I ring him up and say turn your computer on and I'll have a look. Turns out he didn't turn his computer off, just closed Outlook. Whatever.
 I open up Outlook, and check his inbox. Sure enough, emails are disappearing really quickly!
 OK, maybe he's accidentally archived emails newer than 1 second or something? Nope, no archives.
 OK I check his deleted folder to see if they're going there, and there they are - only they're being deleted there too!!!
 I check another folder, WHOA! they're being deleted there as well!
 What about Online? SAME!!! OH CRAP!!!!!! I'm thinking quickly. What could it be???
 Maybe it's a rule? OK I'll check that. I open up the rules, and I struggle to do anything. It won't let me click.
 It's then that I notice that the tabs across the top are flashing as though someone's got tab pressed. So I call the customer, and say "is something on your keyboard???"
 He gives it a thump, and suddenly, emails stop deleting. It was his keyboard, the delete (and possibly Tab) key was stuck or are faulty.
 Overall, it wasn't a long time - about 20 minutes. But I feel like I only thought of the solution because of Silicon Valley:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvDK8tMyCic
 Turns out, 15 folders and over 10,000 items got deleted. I know this, because my powershell script to restore them capped out at 10,000 cos I forgot to add -resultsize unlimited at the end...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,I originally posted this on on r/sophos but also wanted to get a more "networking" guidance..
 We are going through an SG to XG (Firewall) migration with a twist of also removing an outside Cisco ASA. Our Sophos SG is our internal gateway to all of our vlans so the Sophos XG will be the same. We would like to put the two in parallel so that we can slowly migrate a few vlans over at a time, but are struggling with the gateway/routes part.
 Without changing all our IP's and to keep gateways the same - are we best to create a new vlan exclusive for routing all traffic from the XG to the SG?
 For example we disable vlan 2 on SG 192.168.2.1, we then enable vlan 2 on the XG 192.168.2.1But our domain controllers and remainder of our environment is on the SG. So do we static route interface vlan 2 to the IP of the SG? How will it know how to process vlan 2 traffic if the vlan is turned off?
 Our aim is to pick one on prem application at a time and essentially test it before going live. And with everything live and in parallel we can log into the SG and Cisco ASA to compare rules and figure out where the config is incorrect on the Sophos XG.
 Any help or guidance would be appreciated.
 Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a pair of Cisco ASR1001 routers with 4GB of ram each. My neighboring bgp peer is advertising full bgp routes to me, this killed my routers memory. So I configured a route map to block prefixes in except for default route if it was being distributed. (It wasn’t ☹️ ) I noticed that the route map denied 2,753,559 prefixes which seemed to be an excessive amount. I’m guess this excessive amount of routes is due to their blended circuits with full bgp routes so I’m probably receiving all the prefixes with multiple paths and that’s the reason the prefixes are 2.7M ?
 Also in terms of memory will the ASR1001 non X edition support 16GB of ram (2x8 GB) or is it only 4GB sticks with a maximum of 8GB? All content online seems to only talk about 1001X.

 We run Exchange Server 2016 on-prem and will be migrating to Exchange Online (EXO) in the near future. It's about 300 users with 4TB-ish of data and some overly critical public folder mailboxes as well. Ideal end state is a hybrid setup, as we do have some legacy servers that need SMTP access. In addition, inbound mail will still go through Mimecast prior to being delivered to EXO.
 Since we are a small team, we engaged with an MSP to provide a quote to do some of the migration. They provided a "get your tenant configured to best practices and migrate data" quote in the six figure range. That seems very high to me based on the scope of work provided. 
 Those of you who have done this migration, is it six-figures difficult? Also is the use of BitTitan (or similar) really necessary or can the built in migration tools do the job just as well? Having not run through the process I'd like to hear any feedback you may have. 
 Thanks,

 First EVER post on Reddit. I’m a newb network engineer with 3ish years experience. I deal with nexus, firepower, asa, catalyst, and many other brands/versions. I have worked extremely hard the past three years to be where I am and I know a decent amount. The more I turn to certifications and learning current tech, the more I get discouraged and have imposter syndrome. Does anyone else think we are getting way too complex? I mean SD-WAN, APIs on network equipment, vxlan, cloud, multi context firewalls, or multi context per say with nexus. I mean I find the GUI weird and prefer cli. Thanks to firepower and DNA, it’s moving to GUI. Maybe I’m just way too new and dumb at the moment, but I feel like a a lot of this is just craze on hype terms. Also, how do we keep up with all of this? There is no way to know it all. 
 Please let me know you’re thoughts!

I have alot of practical experince (5 years)with Firepower/asa/Secureendpoint/umbrella/DNA/ISE/WSA/Restapi/Python but not ESA. I did study ESA for my CCNP Exam but never deployed one for anyclient sadly. My question is how much practical experince do i need to pass the exam and do the exam ask some question about something you just forgot in the markting presention which has no practical use? To be honest I dont know how to study for this exam . I can deloy any of the products I talked about except ESA with all of its features. is that enough? or do I need more?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: If any of y'all work for ManageEngine, tell the techs to stop fighting for remote control.
 I've had the disproportionately unpleasant experience of working with their techs remotely in probably 20 occasions now. Of those, about half were unproductive, and 4 were straight up infuriating.
 Listen, if your remote access software does not allow me to immediately and consistently take over control from a tech, your remote access software is complete thrash. It's beyond thrash, as it would be more apt to call it malware.
 The amount of times I've had a tech veer off and start making unapproved changes to a production server are ridiculous. One guy straight up navigated away from the ME window and started uninstalling unrelated apps before I straight up spammed Ctrl+Alt+Del. Despite obviously fighting for mouse control for a full 10 seconds so I could even type a message to him, he continued trying to do it. 
 It took me essentially swearing at him in caps (once I had control) for him to apologize and start asking permission before he made any further changes.
 This happened on 4 different occasions with 4 different techs. Baffling. I have some text now I paste to preemptively let them know what the expected etiquette is.
 I despise being a dick to techs, but gotdamn.
 Serves me right for not using a jump RDP to facilitate support.

We are using EAP chaining for wired only and once machine authenticated it has access to the basic AD, DNS etc and once user is authenticated it gets dynamic access to relavent vlan and dacl based on AD group. Now the problem is normally user are connected on wireless which isn't using chaining and only AD username password are used. If user password is expired and they change it while being on wireless they won't be able to get access to network and login to the laptop until their laptop is connected back to wired after password reset. 
 Any idea what could be the issue? Please need your help, I'm banging my head.

 I am in a position where I am clearly putting in more work than was discussed on signing of my contract for my pay rate. Without going into too much detail (but I will if you guys ask), the project is extremely understaffed and I am an extremely important asset to the success of this project, as I know the ins and outs of it all. All the new people we hire keep quitting because they cant handle the fire or maybe they realize the pay doesn't justify the stress.
 Do you think its possible I can go to my contractor and explain to them that we (the contracting company and I) should push for a higher compensation? I know everyone is replacebale, even if I'm not exaggerating about my contributions.
 I think the smartest thing to do would be to just start interviewing again, and then use the new offer as leverage if I decided to stay. What do you guys think?

 I know it’s meant well, but from my end it looks heavily inspired by the Wall Street article ‘It’s Time to Get Rid of the IT Department’. 
 In any case it got me wondering, what’s on your wishlist to increase operational efficiency? Here’s mine: 
 • Additional resources so tier 2/3 can actually focus on strategic tasks and not end user support 
 • More self service (catalog/bot) ++ if we can create micro experiences for users here
 • Stronger processes and training 
 • HRIS and IT directory to be in sync

 She was angry about it. Why should she have to submit a ticket every time there's a problem when her desk is right outside the data closet where the IT guy sits??? She's "special" so she shouldn't have to use that damned ticketing system.
 I tried to calm her, I explained the importance of a ticketing system, and after 30 minutes or so, she finally came around and now I think the IT guy owes me a drink at the next Christmas party....
 It is always good to get the end users perspective from time to time, and more importantly, the ability to explain things in a way that doesn't end with me sleeping on the couch!

 Duplicate NAT statements for each circuits interface (inside > out, out > inside, out > out..etc).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to wrap my head around this:
 We have a Cisco ASA 5515-X. And we use a static NAT rule with automatic address translation rules to direct HTTPS traffic to a specific web server on one of our LANs. This works fine from the Internet and LANs behind the ASA but does not work from our other /29 static WAN IPs from separate routers.
 From our ISP handoff we connect all of our routers outside interfaces to an 8-port unmanaged switch. We do have an ACL in the ASA to allow HTTPS to this server as it works from the Internet without issue. The issue is any traffic from our other 3 routers/networks using this /29 WAN IP range can't access HTTPS on this server. These /29 WAN IPs rightfully do NOT go out to the Internet and know their next hop is another router on this unmanaged switch.
 It looks like traffic is being blocked by a 'rpf-check' subtype on the HTTPS static NAT rule.
 nat (inside,outside) static interface service tcp https https
 So maybe I'm using the wrong NAT setup, or some traffic isn't being matched so it's being blocked by an implicit rule?
 What we are trying to do is to allow users of these other networks to access our websites on this web server. This used to work when we had a different ISP, but they were very different static WAN IPs with the old ISP and not from the same /29 range.
 P.S. I know the ASA 5515-X is end of life and we are working on replacing it.

 I've started to dig into more advanced (still rather simple compared to full-out enterprise but I'll get there eventually) networking, and there are a multitude of resources for the major players, as well as a pretty strong community for SONIC. What I cannot find, for the life of me, is more than the introductory "user manual" PDF for ICOS, which doesn't actually describe how to do much more than set VLANs and configure the management port.
 I recently came into possession of a whitebox switch with ICOS pre-installed, and I was hoping someone has had experience and/or resources before I just go caveman "play with it till I break it, then wipe and install SONIC" on it (apparently, at least as to the newest information I can find for my particular switch/ASIC, SONIC breaks break-out functionality for the QSFP+ ports, and while not 100% necessary since it's just one of several learning platforms, I would like to have that function).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Half of the job is absolutely a learned skill, working with software that the average user would have no idea how to work. 
 But I swear, half of the issues I resolve are me being the only one in the room to point out that you can't plug a power strip into itself and expect it to work. Today I was assured a piece of equipment was plugged in - the cable was plugged into the device, but not a power source. Why does it feel like so much of my day is dedicated to what should be fixable by anyone who is even remotely paying attention?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a bizarre situation and I'm stumped.
 Yesterday, I was suddenly unable to reach a particular website - can't ping it. I logged in to a virtual machine within 10miles of me and I can't get to the website there either. I checked "Down for Me" and it's not down. I checked a third PC, located 300 miles away, and I can get to the website.
 Here's where it gets weird. I check another PC in the same local network as the PC that can't reach the site, and I can get to the site!
 I ran tracert on the one that can reach it, and it looks like it's not going through the same DNSs.
 Can anyone shed some light on what's going on? I suspect some DNS gremlins - but it's out of my league.
 Should add - I own the website - and it's running perfectly.

I changed the IP of the server and all is good. But now my CK is constantly dropping offline. Note, that we did have a quick power flicker but our network stack is guarded with a UPS, it's also powered with PoE, not the USB. Is my only option to reset and restore?
 Edit: Just realized that the CK Gen 2 has a backup battery internally for scenarios as such. So I'm not sure why and how it would be corrupted

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of the most common things that I see on here are issues with IT Departments getting notified of personnel changes. New hires, terminations, title changes, department moves, etc. 
 Does your company have a real HRIS? Not some spreadsheet Karen put together, but a publicly purchasable platform? It probably has an API. It could even have web hooks. 
 Take the time, if you have the coding chops or someone in the company does, to set up a connection to that API and monitor employee changes. 
 Billy gets fired and the HRIS gets updated? Automatic email to the IT ticket system. Becky gets hired? Automatic email to the ticket system. Andy changes job titles? IT probably needs to change security groups, distribution groups, and update AD properties. Guess what. Automated email to the ticket system. Jenn stays in the same position but changes supervisors? You guessed it, email to the ticket system. Heather went on FMLA and needs a temporary revocation of access? Believe it or not, automatic email to the ticket system. 
 There are no more late notifications, as long as HR is on the ball. You are eliminating the weak link- humans remembering they need to tell IT. 
 Even if you can't do it in house, hire someone. Your ROI is huge. Customer service improves. Visibility improves. Metrics on time to delivery become meaningful. 
 HR doesn't have an HRIS? Well, that's probably the first thing the company needs.

No matter what position I'm in I seemingly can't escape this customer service mindset from management and its driving me insane. I don't care about their issues. I don't care about their whining. That's for helpdesk. I'm here to build infrastructure, improve security, and ensure five nines of uptime. I'm not putting on any sort of customer service persona. Put in a ticket to helpdesk, do not approach me personally.
 The kicker is that I'm actually a very nice person for an IT guy - I frequently go out with coworkers, go to almost all the company events, get coffee with users, etc, but the enforcement of customer service has gone so far to extend to my real personality. I hate it, I want to be nice and not view everyone as an annoyance but this mindset makes it impossible.
 Anyways, did I get into the wrong industry? If so, what's an industry where you don't have to deal with people, or listen to their whining? At this point I'm totally willing to change career paths so I can get my personality back.

When I look at the machines, and check with Microsoft, it shows the update is needed - obviously it is needed. I can see the update in WSUS...I can also see that machines are reporting back to WSUS and in fact, it did show about three other updates for Office as needed. I tried cleaning up WSUS last night...ran a bunch SQL scripts to clean it up, but still, it does not show the November update as needed by any machines. Has anyone seen anything like this? I am about ready to try to reinstall WSUS.

 We have run into a problem lately where 3rd party contractors and vendors not using their own laptops / desktops cannot connect to our RDS Apps. When connecting to the app they get stuck on Configuring Remote Session and it sits cycling forever.
 None of our domain joined company devices are having this issue. Re-imaging a non-domain joined laptop that we use for testing also resolved the issue but obviously telling 3rd party users to wipe their machines isn't a viable solution.
 This appears to be a recent issue and the only recent change I can remember making to the environment is updating the certificates about a month ago. I double checked that certificate was applied to all of the Broker roles and in the Gateway manager as well as IIS.

 I am currently working as a Configuration Team lead on a team of four supporting our Windows and Mac endpoints. I've been in this role since about 2018 and I don't feel like I am growing skill-wise anymore. The environment is very lax and I tend to have lots of down time, with spurts of busy periods, but overall our team is very much overlooked so we don't often get fun things to work on. Our client is a painful at times to work with, and our contract mgmt side is abysmal. There's a bit of this unfair treatment of workers where the good performers are punished for doing their jobs well, while the bad performers fly under the radar unharmed. All in all, it's a bit toxic and I've been wanting to find greener pastures.

 Before I get hung, drawn and quartered by the sub, we will eventually turn them on but we are currently working on the tenant and they are not needed.
 MS in it's ineffable wisdom have decided they will force-enable them in 6 days.
 I want to opt out of this without activating them.
 I have searched online and found plenty of "how to disable" but nothing about prevention.
 Anyone here know if there's a setting somewhere that amounts to "leave me alone for another week or so"?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is just for future reference, since this has been a lengthy support case @ Microsoft. And there had been only 1 search result online which led nowhere.
 When trying to repair our CTR Office installs we were presented with an error code 30029-9 - supposedly Office has no internet connection stating "Online Repairs need the internet and it looks like you may not be connected."
 We finally pinned it down to a group policy that's Enabled but left blank. This used to work, and now somehow it doesn't anymore since. And apparently it's "By design".
 The group policy setting is 
 Target Version
 The field "Update Version" was blank. Which now triggers this error. And even though the Group Policy itself says "If you enable this policy setting, but you leave the version blank, Office is updated to the most current version that’s available at the update location for Office" it's no longer working and it's _by design_ that it's suddenly starting to spill this error.
 If we set the policy to "Not Configured" - everything is working fine.
 So the resolution to this; Not Configured. 🤷‍♂️

 No. this guy wants me to make sure the (new 0 online hour) hardrives "have loose bearings, so the disks can spin freely"
 Apparently if they aren't "burnt-in" they will be slow for a few months while the drives' ware in their barrings 
 ​
 have you ever heard of any such procedure? Any idea where this notion came from?

 The plan is for a training environment for my team (SOC/IR) to work through scenario-based engagements with our in-house red team, but we need some "noise" for the red team to blend into. Ideally, something that will generate user activity in the form of opening applications, logging in and out, accessing sites, and email traffic - the things you would see daily on a live network. As it stands, without this, the moment the red team performs any action, it is immediately obvious as they are generating the only traffic.

 I plan to use update feature that is given when you start the iso from Windows server 2019.
 Of course I'm planning a downtime for the virtual servers. Also I want the virtual servers to run as they do now.
 Has anyone done a similar upgrade? Will this upgrade affect the virtual servers in any kind?
 Does anyone have further recommendations?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. I was in desktop support for a larger internal IT department for 3 years before this (total of 7 years including my first job there in helpdesk)
 Didn't touch intune/group policy/or another form of remote management previously. I was just on the but end of stick and kicked off images and did deskside support for workstations and hardware support for laptops.
 An opportunity came to me 6 months ago from my old boss who changed companies for a MSP and I became a "Systems Administrator" basically everything to do with remote workstation and application management with a bit of apple mdm in the mix also. Intune/group policy/PDQ/some PowerShell scripting/MDT/SCCM/remote application deployment and updates.
 This was everything I wanted to do in my last role but it went to the sysadmins to do and I had no access.
 When I started there was a senior guy who knew everything and was loads of help to escalate to. He has since resigned since a few weeks ago.
 So now me and the other new guy are on our own. The ticket queue keeps building up and there are dozens of tickets that neither of us have any idea how to fix. SLA's are ticking away and customers are expecting updates for ticketd that have been sitting in the same status for weeks
 Yes I'm getting my googling and actioning stuff, making mistakes and fixing things but everyday is completely miserable. I went from knowing everything at the back in of my hand to bieng a junior again
 Those that went from helpdesk/desktop support to a "sysadmin" position how did you cope/deal with the day to day workloads?
 Thanks

 We're currently about to deploy the M365 Apps for Enterprise (Office 365) to our endusers. For patching we use a 3rd Party Patch Management solution (Matrix42 PatchManagement) which manages the new office versions. The clients should therefore not use auto updates via CDN as the patches should all be installed via the 3rd-party solution. 
 To achieve this, we tried to disable the automatic updates using group policy and set the option "Enable Automatic Updates" to "Disabled". Enable Automatic Updates (admx.help) 
 At first launch when the policy is active the update seems to be disabled but as soon as I login with an Azure AD account in order to get office licensed the option is reset and updates are offered via CDN.
 Did anyone face a similar behavior already and knows if there is an additional option in the M365 tenant configuration which may overrules the GPO setting?
 Thanks in advance.

 Situation:
 PC1 has 2 network addresses configured (primary 192.168.1.10, secondary 192.168.20.201) and is connected to the Fortigate 30e.
 PC1 tries to communicate with another PC2 through Fortigate with address .20.201 -> .20.8
 Fortigate has only 192.168.1.99/24 lan address and firewall rules for the .1.0/24.
 Client says that connection works, but it is slow ( 50-100kB/s ) if you try to send something from .20.201 -> .20.8.
 Client also said that connection is fast when you remove Fortigate and just connect those PC's together. Also with some stupid switch the connection works fine.
 How can this even work because Fortigate don't have any .20.0/24 configurations? Do i need to add secondary IP or how should i configure that.
 Spoiler: I'm new to the networking field and this is my first job related to the networking configurations, so please don't kill me, if this is too simple question.

 So I'm struggling with getting the drive setup as a usable volume in windows.
 Does anyone have any tips or tricks i could try? I've been searching on the Synology knowledge base but can't find any relevant info.

My last position was a salaried IT support specialist, which came out to 25/hour (52k/year - yes, i believe I was overpaid there). This is a contract to hire position, and it was mentioned that if hired the salary would be around 70k, and from brief research in my state that's about right. I know I'm technically an employee of the contracting company, but am I being kinda shafted here? I'm not too hung up on this as the position looks great on my resume, but I am slightly annoyed by it, especially since I'm making less than I was in what many would consider a less in-demand position.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been a little stumped trying to troubleshoot a site of mine. I’m an IT engineer, I like to think I’m not a complete n00b, I’ve successfully been in this field for 10 years I just neglected to learn some of the basics but do well at learning on the go. 
 This site has 1GB single mode dedicated fiber coming in to the MPOE. We are currently, and temporarily, using an office space with existing infrastructure. They got CAT5E running to this MDF, into my Meraki MX100, and then back out over CAT5E into a Meraki 24PoE switch (can’t recall which model at the moment but can confirm ports are 1Gb compatible) and then to 4 Meraki MR42s. We are a commercial construction company, this site hosts our team as well as our subcontractors which are mainly an architectural firm and a mechanical/electrical/plumbing — aka high usage on full days (250gb up and down). The device connections are spread evenly across the WAPs. Channel utilization is also spread well. Users connected to the WAPs max on speed tests at 72mb. On these busy days there could be 30-50 users. I’m trying to understand how there’s so much loss to the user. I haven’t been able to test directly myself, but the ISP Claims their circuit test results at full speeds. Tests from my router max at 750mb. Tests from the switch max close to that. Tests from the WAPs max at 200mb. Again the user even on a light user day gets 72 — but on busy days they experience soooo much latency and I’m just… lost. I cant see where or why. 
 Application usage in the dashboard shows normal activity, UDP or secure web, MS apps, AWS etc (lot of cloud storage, pretty much everything is SaaS). 
 But I do wonder if the CAT5E is an issue. 
 Can anyone provide some guidance on testing further or troubleshooting? Or validate my one and only theory? Thanks in advance and sorry for sounding like a network n00b. I promise I’m not a total beginner.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a need to block messages from being sent to Microsoft365 "unified" groups. Every team we have has a unified group, and we want to stop people from using e-mail to mail the group. 
  
All Groups have domain: myTLD.onmicrosoft.com
 All Groups have start with "part_"
 All Users are in a dynamic Microsoft 365 group: "Block E-mail" with an e-mail address of blockemail@myTLD.onmicrosoft.com
  
Because the groups are always being added, I don't want to block it at the group level with delivery management options (unless this is the better/only way). I'm hoping a transport rule will work for this: 
 I created a transport rule "Block Messages to Teams Groups"
 If message
 Includes these words in the recipient's address 'part_' and and recipients's address domain portion belongs to any of these domains: 'myTLD.onmicrosoft.com' and Is received from a member of group 'blockemail@myTLD.onmicrosoft.com'
 Do the following
 Set audit severity level to 'Low' and reject the message and include the explanation 'E-mail to part Teams is not allowed.' with the status code: '5.7.1'
 The above rule isn't catching the messages. In message trace. [User1@TLD.com](mailto:User1@TLD.com) (internal message) hits the "[part_restofemail@myTLD.onmicrosoft.com](mailto:part_something@myTLD.onmicrosoft.com)" e-mail address (a M365 Group), expands and then sends to all members of the group.
 Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, looking for some gear suggestions for a proposed setup at my work because there’re too many options on the market for my small brain to handle. 
 Relatively remote mine site with no fixed connection available, have now got a Starlink online serving as the main connection with a 4G modem as a failover, the rest is basically a mess I’m looking to overhaul. 
 Things I know I need and their requirements below - switch - currently eyeballing a smart/managed device, needs to handle VLANing and possibly some PoE. Probably 10 medium usage devices so throughput likely not a factor, but open to suggestions of standalone routers etc - access points - all devices are currently running on wifi which works well enough for now, so looking for access points that can handle VLAN/multi-SSID (at least 4?), one of which will be located outside 
 Also open to any other suggestions for things to be added. Looking at adding local servers with VPN access and dedicated firewalls and all that jazz once I get a tech consultant out, but just trying to set up segregated/isolated network traffic for different businesses on site/QoS/stuff I understand now. 
 Thanks!

They don't make it to the gateway which leaves either the internal networking or the switch (there's only a switch and a firewall on this VLAN).
 Is this something normal that I don't know about?
 Any ideas of where in the linux networking stack this might occur?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been the industry for over ten years. Quickly moved in to infrastructure and worked for an MSP where I deployed firewalls, phone systems, switches and some servers. After that I had a short stint as a manager and got back in to infrastructure.
 I would assume my work at the MSP was/is very similar to what consultants do. At the MSP our sales guys would sell some equipment and I'd go in, figure out what they have, how to make it better (or more secure) and deploy the equipment. I assume consultants focus on the middle part, figuring out what you have and make suggestions for improvement. 
 I am by no means an expert but a "jack of all trades, master of none" type. Really, I know how to google stuff. I don't have certs. I learn enough about a system to get it to work how I need it to and then move on.
 I believe this would be mostly network related consulting. I don't have many details yet. 
 Anyways, I told him I was interested but not sure what to expect or even know what I should be paid or if there's anything I should do to protect myself. 
 Any advice would be much appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently purchased 8 SonicWall switches. We have had a SonicWall firewall for a few years and have been impressed by it so I unfortunately assumed the quality level of their switches would be the same. That was a horrible assumption and I'm looking to replace all 8 SonicWall switches now. But part of the reason we went with SonicWall instead of Dell or Cisco was because of availability issues. Does anyone know of a brand that has switches available for immediate or within a few weeks shipping that they could genuinely recommend. 
 I need;
 4, 24 port gigabit switches 
 2, 48 port gigabit switches
 2 48 port gigabit POE+ switches
 All with 2, 10 gig uplink ports or SFP+'s

 I've only physically connected to one of the switches so far but I've provisioned the second one in the cli of switch 1 and configured both sets of ports. I've also set the first switch to priority 15 to ensure it remains switch1 when I connect them.
 My question is, if I connect the stack now, with the second switch containing a factory default config (same firmware), will the provisioned switch 2 port configs get applied to the actual switch 2? Are there any other steps I need to take to ensure that happens?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently took over managing DNS and our cloud based WAF for my company. We have a websites hosted on a combination of several subdomains and root domains (e.g. my.company.com & company.com). Currently I'm trying to see if it's possible to route 100% of our traffic through our cloud based WAF before it reaches our firewall. 
 At one point I tried doing a permanent 301 forwarding of the root domain company.com to www.company.com, and then C-naming www.company.com to the edgekey which points to the site. This worked for HTTPS, but broke HTTP redirection causing the site to fail if you didn't specify HTTPS. 
 Next, I thought AWS might work if we moved our domains there because they allow ALIAS records for root/apex domains, but after closer inspection it seems limited to only pointing to something else hosted at AWS. https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/resource-record-sets-choosing-alias-non-alias.html
 After a bit of a learning process, it's looking like the only real option to route ALL traffic through our WAF is to pay them to host our subdomains/root domains for us. This isn't cheap. Since I've only been dealing with public DNS & WAFs for a few months , I thought I'd ask and see if anyone knew of an alternative?

Our Exchange admin ran a powershell script and said she has ~19,500 folders, I ran a Vbs macro (I don’t have access to Exchange powershell) and it said she had 29,000 folders.
 Do I have to sift through 20,000 sub folders within nested sub folders to clean this up? I’m not knowledgeable about Exchange PS at all but I’d assume the exchange admin would have offered some solution if there was one.
 This all came about when trying to replace her computer, some of her sub folders weren’t appearing. The exchange admins were suggesting basic things like restarting or reloading her profile- I found a Microsoft article saying cached versions of outlook run into issues when a user has 500 folders so I asked the exchange admins if they could tell on their how many she had (before I found the macro) and lo and behold they said that was likely the issue

 Currently the devices in Office 2 can get through to the regular internet and can access resources from Office 1 via the IPSEC tunnel. 
 Also our VoIP (Mitel) phones are not getting Voicemails or Directory services (calls work internally and externally).
 Office 2 has a VoIP switch (ShoreTel/Mitel).
 Wondering if the IPSEC tunnel is missing some configuration? Or there could be some configuration I am missing on the Layer 3 switch?
 The new Office 2 location also has Aruba switches in place. Will add more details if there are more questions.

 I have recently deployed a branch of my company with 100% of meraki switch (ms120/410)) with all the network protection "on" :
 - Stormcontrol (broadcast/unknown unicast/multicast) 80%
 - RSTP (core 4096 / others 8192 )
 - IGMP snooping / Flood unknown multicast traffic "enable"
 Everythings works fine except for the deployment of Windows client with SCCM Server (F12) on all my VLAN. Some client are in the same VLAN than the SCCM server DP, some not so my Paloalto'FW (connected to the core) is making ip helper relay for all VLANs.
 DHCP server are on a datacenter, outside the lan, so i put the mac address of the FW has the only DHCP server allowed on my Meraki network profil. DHCP standard request works fine like that.
 Another branch is full meraki too but with no protection and F12 works fine so i suppose that is somethings on my meraki configuration...
 Any ideas ?

Individually, each of the units works properly. However when all LAN/WAN links are enabled on both appliances, they appear to both try to go active which causes a big headache. 
 Each unit can communicate via heartbeat, until failover is attempted, and then they stop being able to hear each other’s heartbeat packets until they are rebooted. Unit failover is confirmed to be configured properly by Fatpipe support (it’s the identical config that was working on our old units).
 FatPipes documentation is.. mediocre, and their support has been unable to resolve the issue. Just wanted to see if anyone has experienced something similar with their Warp appliances? Grasping at straws here.

 I am looking to add a second Nexus 5k to my environment with a vPC configuration with the existing 5k. Currently, my UCS environment has both FI A and FI B plugged into the single Nexus 5k.
 Are there any specific changes I need to be considerate of in UCS when plugging FI-B into the second 5k?
 Right now, the config on the single 5k is:
 interface Ethernet1/10 description link to FI A switchport mode trunk switchport trunk native vlan 69 interface Ethernet1/11 description link to FI B switchport mode trunk switchport trunk native vlan 69 
 I am not sure yet why the second ports from each FI were never configured. Maybe licensing?
 I raised a request with Cisco support, and they pointed me to a document regarding disjointed networks, which I'm not sure applies to this scenario.
 Please let me know if I can provide additional detail.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Guys, I’m stuck scratching my head on this one but I figured someone might have a good idea here.
 Recently I discovered some odd access switch behavior, the following config and results occurs; Layer 2 switch downstream from layer3 is adding routes to the routing table that are not accurate and are causing asymmetric traffic.
 Layer 2 switch, cisco catalyst, is configured with only a default gateway of the core, ip routing is not enabled and no static routes defined.
 When we pull up routes on the layer 2, there are specific hosts getting routed to the next hop after the core switch, often times this route is pointing to the default route that is configured on the core.
 I have never seen an access switch add host entires into a routing table before, I thought this could have been an issue with CEF but that doesn’t seem to be the case.
 We also thought it might have been a route redistribution issue, but we’ve now ruled that out as testing from a different remote subnet only experiences a few access switches following this behavior.
 I’ve been toying with the idea that this might be proxy arp, but the fact that it’s not every device has me on the fence.
 Any advice or suggestions are most welcome.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So once again I found myself outside my comfort level troubleshooting Cisco switches that seemed to have frozen, and was trying to see if it is a fiber issue, SFP issue or a switch issue. Luckily it was just a switch that needed power cycling, but if it was an SFP issue I don’t have a way to test them and I have no need to be carrying SFP with me for spares since this is the first time I came across an issue recently. Is there a usb to SFP adapter that I can throw any SFP into? Bonus if they support 10g fiber. 
 Thank you in advance

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow network geeks!
 We are setting up a new property with all the structured cabling being CAT6A
 I have a couple of questions
  
We will have 10G capable switches. We will also have cable runs that will be as long as 80m.If the patch cord in the cabinet (patch panel <-> switch) is a 3m cat6 cable, will we be able to get 10G across the cable run?
 Some switches will have PoE+ devices. Our cable vendor suggested that we if we use 30AWG CAT6A cable for the patching (patch panel <-> switch), we will only be able to bundle together 12 cables because of the heat dissipation. Have you ever run across this issue?
  
I would love to hear your thoughts
 ​
 Edit: 
 I found the question to answer 2 in this link

What I need is to allow viewing permissions for dcim objects that have a certain tenant and don't have a certain tag assigned to them. It would be easy to return objects that have a certain tenant and tag, but I specifically need to exclude everything with that tag.
 These objects also sometimes have multiple tags assigned to them and sometimes they have none.
 Could anyone help me, please? :( Thanks

 Installing this while storage is set to RAID in BIOS generates a BSOD with Inaccessible_Boot_Device message. AHCI works fine (But with 7420 i have often seen AHCI been reset to RAID for unknown reasons and this has generated many support cases, so i prefer to use the default RAID option).
 ​
 Solution: I rolled back to the previous driver package we used (A08). A09 is not tested, but if you have used A09 and it worked, it should be safe rolling back to that.
 ​
 Hopefully this will reduce time spent om troubleshooting for some of you :)

 I need to configure all of our endpoints to automatically connect to networks on the Public profile (not Private/Home) and am unsure of the best way to go about it. Is there an easy way to block through Intune or another method that I can deploy to the endpoints?
 One issue I find is that many devices have already connected to these networks and it would be nice to configure them differently instead of dealing with 100 blocks and network issue tickets the moment that would be enabled. One solution I thought of was to deploy a script that flipped all the networks to Public through the DWORD in the registry under all previously connected networks.
 This feels like a dumb question, so anything is helpful but let me know if I am being dumb and there is a better way to handle this (such as configuring the way private networks are handled)...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In short, have 10 new hires starting in a week's time. Our supplier has only just let me know there will be a three week delay in receiving the laptops for them. HR is putting on the pressure, as they said they'll have to pay them from their promised start date, even if they can't technically work yet. Has anyone experienced this problem and know some work arounds?
 Edit: for more context, I'm at a startup that's scaling quite quickly, so this has been an ongoing issue. Especially because we're based in the Netherlands and these new employees are mostly working remote. So I need to first get them delivered to the office, then set them up (MDM, etc), then dispatch to the employees wherever they are. We have a relationship with just one supplier, so always encouraged to go through them. However, seems like this won't be scalable. Good idea to have buffer stock so will use this thread for the next conversation. Also looking into more scalable solutions/platforms that streamline this whole thing. 
 Thank you for all the advice. Pray for me!

 ​
 Im trying to add a log-prefix to a message before its send to a syslog server. But something not working the way i thought it would.
 ​
 I read from a log file:
 source s_esxihostd {
 file("/data/logs/hostd.log" follow-freq(1) program_override("esxi070: ") flags(no-parse));
 };
 ​
 Destination to send:
 destination d_network {
 syslog("x.x.x.x" transport("tcp") port(514));
 };
 ​
 Logfile is being sent:
 log {
 source(s_esxihostd);destination(d_network);
 };
 ​
 The message is sent to the syslog server - but the "prefix" (esxi070) arent printed before the logmessage. I would have expected on the syslog server: "esxi070: <log string>"
 Am i doing it wrong? Or is there another way to add a prefix in syslog-ng, for what i can tell it should be the program-override() because the log-prefix() it deprecated?

Soon as we did almost every day they tell us they can't switch to Multi-user mode. We can't find anything wrong, no errors reported by DB Manager, service is always running. We simply login, tell it to scan, accept the warning and it starts working. Maybe for a day, maybe for a few hours, maybe for a week. 
 They can all get to the files just fine from the file share. When they choose multi user mode it doesn't work until we click the scan button again. We have several servers with DB manager installed but this one is the only one giving us a problem. Quickbooks support has no clue what's wrong. 
 The only oddity that occurred, while we were running the both the SBS 2011 and the 2019 standard some users had issues getting to file shares, as in the connection just seemed very slow. All local lan GB switched. As soon as we cut over the 2019 to be DC and GC with all roles, that issue disappeared. The only issue they still have is resetting the DB manager constantly to allow multi user mode.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[As a bit of a background: On September 14th, bleepingcomputer.com published an article of a security vulnerability in the desktop client of MS Teams. They recommended, that users should switch to the browser version of MS Teams, until a patch is available. I made all my users use the browser client after reading this article.
 Now I accidently found an article by Tony Redmond, in which he argues, that the vulnerability is not easily exploitable in the real world. He recommends not to switch to the browser version, and still use the desktop version of MS Teams.
 Microsoft itself doesn't think, that the vulnerability is critical, and has no priority of fixing the bug.
 So, did I overreact, when I advised my users to use the browser client? (They are nagging each week, that they would rather use the desktop client.)
 And how do you decide in general, if a security vulnerability is worth the effort?
 Edit: Made the argument clearer

 It's my ocsweb database and it works if i GLPI uses it as its database too but is it a good practice ? If not why ?

 So my initial thought was to do this in PowerShell combined with Intune. But the Intune part seems a little bit too limited for my liking. Or I am not bright enough to solve this puzzle.
 So in terms to understand this behavior, it is when a user connects an USB device with a specific ID, it will install the software/driver for the device.
 I have found the device ID of the device, and setup a detection for it, tested it with multiple different devices and it is the same for this device on every single PC that I have tested with.

I have reviewed all posts regarding this issue and have tried disabling device guard, also tried with forcing TLS 1.2, but none of this helped. Which is suprising me, since I have seen a lot of comments claiming that helped. What I also have tried is updating the Intel driver for wifi card to the newest version. 
 What else I can try? Does it make sense to set 'Disabled" on Turn On Virtualization based Security, if it was set to Not Configured by defaults? This question is extra one, for curiosity only, since I tried to change to Disabled and still cannot connect. All windows 10 are able to connect at the same time.

 So, here's the situation - I updated my zabbix-server from 5.4.3 to 6.0.10, did it following the instructions on these pages:
 https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/installation/upgrade/sources
 https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/installation/install#installing-zabbix-daemons
 Then I start the server by doing
 systemctl start zabbix-server
 Everything seems to be OK at this point, and systemctl status zabbix-server returns this: Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/zabbix-server.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled) Active: active (running) since Mon 2022-11-07 17:03:57 MSK; 18h ago Process: 121913 ExecStop=/bin/kill -SIGTERM $MAINPID (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS) Process: 121915 ExecStart=/usr/local/sbin/zabbix_server -c $CONFFILE (code=exited, status=0/SUCCESS) Main PID: 121917 (zabbix_server) Tasks: 1 (limit: 48660) Memory: 1.8M CGroup: /system.slice/zabbix-server.service └─121917 /usr/local/sbin/zabbix_server -c /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf

 I'd like to put some numbers to this to see if it's actually beneficial. I've done a quick bit of math and found that we would have to print out 130,000 pages to cost roughly the same as the iPad (about 4 years worth of this job). 
 Is there a way to factor in the environmental cost of the iPad? I'm guessing that all the silicon, glass, gold, zinc etc. are harder to recycle than standard paper, but it would be nice to have a way of quantifying this. 
 Is there any way I can work this out more scientifically than guesswork?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 Yesterday, I had a problem with firmware upgrade with C9300 and thanks to you, it is solved.
 Now, I have a another problem.
 I configured two 9200 switch as stack switch. After speaking with my colleague, we said that is better that we unstack the switches instead. The problem is that I now can not access the switches after configuring TACACS. I only configured tacacs (they are not installed in the network yet) but I did not configure line con 0 (which Im using for accessing the switches). It just ask me about a username for whatever reason and I can not grasp why.
 Anyway, I would like to factory-reset both the switches from rommon mode. The problem is that, I do not find the correct command to do it.
 Here is all the command in rommon mode for C9200:
 switch: ?
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 arp Dump or Clear ARP Table
 boot Load and boot an executable image
 cat Display text content from a file
 copy Copy a file
 dir List filesystems or a directory on a filesystem path
 help List command information
 history Show command history
 idprom Show idprom data
 ping Ping use ICMP protocol to get an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from host
 ping6 Ping use ICMP protocol to get an ICMP ECHO_RESPONSE from host
 reset Reset entire system
 set Set an environment variable value
 unset Unsets an environment variable
 version Show sboot version and runtime info
 - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -
 ​
 I used the "reset" command but there is no difference. Not sure what the reset command really do but it does not do a factory-reset which I want.
 Would appreciate any help or any guide you know of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a two customers experiencing the same issue and everything has led me to think it’s their network - probably because the way they’re putting together two ISP connections.
 I don’t know how it’s bonded though. It could be through a failover or load balanced. I don’t know. Anyhow, when I set SMTP settings into a MFP, only one email service provider works.
 Not Yahoo, not Gmail, not even the ISPs own email servers establish a connection. They all get timed out. There’s one email service provider that does work but the customers aren’t allowed to use that one because they aren’t paying for it.
 I increased the connection time. Tried multiple DNS. I’ve gone through the whole app passwords thing. I’ve gone through each port. I’ve tested through telnet with success. I also logged in each web portal site and can indeed send emails. I can even connect the MFP to a mobile network and send emails with any of those SMTP settings with no problem. Just not through their network except for that one email service provider. 
 Everything that makes sending emails through an MFP work should work, but doesn’t and it’s only happened with these two customers with their bonded network connections. What I think is happening is that the 250 OK isn’t coming back, so the MFP just gives up. 
 What can I ask them to look for when I visit them again? Should I ask to plug in and tracert, telnet, etc. from within? I get scared plugging into another’s network.
 I can’t ask if the prefix or suffix is being blocked, nor can I ask if the port is being blocked because that one email service provider works. It’s just all other ones don’t. ¯_(ツ)_/¯
 Sorry for the inconvenience.

 Hope you all are doing well and safe.
 I have been assigned to replace the old cisco 3750 and 2960 switches with cisco 9200L series. 
 I have restored the cisco switches which are on the same model, but in this case the models are different. So, I am assuming that this might not be possible as there are differences in hardware and possbily OS version as well.
 What's the best way for the above situation? The old switches are still in production.
 Many thanks :)

 I'm an aspiring sysadmin and still need a lot to learn. That's why I'm making this thread. To collect knowledge from people that are smarter than me.
 Surely some of you have gotten to a point, at which you struggled to solve a certain problem. I noticed, that I often find myself in such scenarios, with no idea on how to address the issue.
 Are there a single or more processes a sysadmin can go through, to solve problems? I am willing and eager to learn, but I cant seem to find the thing I'm looking for. I know that there is no single way to solve all problems, but surely there has to be some kind of approach, to determine what the issue is, right? 
 I'll define what I would call a "process" using a problem, I've got to solve at the moment. 
 I've got VoIP PBX that works like it should, with one exception: the FAX service.
 Since the PBX doesnt send faxes like the old way, it receives an incoming fax , converts the content into a mail and sends the mail to the recipient. This stopped working a few days ago. 
 After a little search, I noticed that the mail server doesnt work anymore. The testmail results in an error message. So I changed it to a Google SMTP to check if the function still works, which it does. The testmail is send successfully, but someone never arrives. 
 Is there a way to check why my testmail does not arrive, and if yes, how?

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month's updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft's Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft's updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work.
 Test, test, and test!

My plan is to walk her through how the simulations will work and what she'll need to do, so I'm hoping for a tool that has a phish reporting mechanism (maybe forwarding an email to specific email address?) and is of low cost (or preferably free!)
 Does anyone know of any such offerings? Or maybe a bigger security company like Knowbe4 has a personal/family plan?

 EDIT; with guidance from our MSP we ran a Veeam restore of the DC. Veeam puts the restored DC in non-authoritative mode, after it grabs the latest AD info it switches out of that mode (I think!).

 WSUS was passed over for Intune, but Intune wasn't deployed when it was supposed to be. Therefore, as a stopgap, I'm being asked to use GPO to force feature updates.
 Many of our devices are stuck at 21h1 which was the version built into the image. Devices refuse to update to 21h2. The update doesn't even show when checking for updates. However, downloading and running the installer tool allows it to install without issue.
 Has anyone seen this before? I ran the troubleshooter and it can't figure it out either.
 I wrote the GPO to force-check updates and update to at least 21h2 with business hours excluded and different settings for mandatory restarts etc.
 If this fails, aside from going machine to machine, I'm at a loss...

I am not a networking guy; I knew that it would not be as easy as plugging the switch in an it would work immediately - but I also didn't realize that I needed to build an operating system to make it work At the moment I have a $10,000 door stop; I have cloned the onie repo and attempted to build for Mellanox and then I started working through issues (this library isn't installed, that tool isn't installed..) for about 1.5 hours before reaching an error indicating that I should not be a root user, but then nothing works unless I am root so...?? In looking through the onie repo the SN2100 isn't even listed as supported hardware and it hasn't been updated for 5-8 years. 
 Is there an image on the switch that works somewhere, or is this something that everyone has to deal with? How do I get an OS that is made for the switch and works properly?
 It seems crazy to me that a company would sell a product that is so expensive and then just have a pointer to an open source project and not even say "good luck, have fun! lol". :(

 edit: to clarify, one of this reason I am not using switching functions is because the hardware may all be unmanaged, and if it is managed - I will not have the credentials.

 I am reviewing the power loss prevention strategy at a client site due to a severe power outage we had over the weekend that caused issues and the UPS did not pick up the slack quickly enough. I am reviewing the UPS situation so this question is solely looking at the R220 server.
 The server we have is an R220 with the H310 raid controller and Write Through enabled.
 Since Write Through is enabled there should be minimal loss (if any) during a power outage. Is there any advantage (other than performance) for upgrading the H310 to an H710P with a battery? Or does the advantage only come into play when Write Back is turned on?
 TLDR: If I have write through turned on with an H310, does upgrading to an H710P with a battery (with write through remaining on, NOT write back), do we gain any additional power loss protection?

 I'm a bit stuck on this one and any assistance would be amazing. I'm very much an Nginx noob.
 We have an existing Nginx setup with lots of redirections already configured.
 I'm trying to only redirect one subdomain in Nginx to an external url, however no matter what I try it redirects all subdomains. 
 I've reviewed our existing configs to get some understanding of how things are setup but the life of me I just can't work this one out and all the search results I seem to find are for redirecting all subdomains or sub sites not for redirecting just one subdomain of many.
 This subdomain didn't have an existing config and I've had to create one (copy one of our others and edit it) it looks like previously the subdomain was configured under a catch all.
 Example:
 I need https://foo-bar.test.com.au to redirect to https://externalURL.com
 However I don't want https://other-site.test.com.au to redirect to https://externalURL.com
 This is the current config
 ******************************************************************
 server {
 server_name foo-bar.test.com.au;
 rewrite ^ https://externalURL.com;
 root /opt/nginx-static/foo-bar;
 }
 ​
 server {
 listen 443 ssl http2;
 server_name foo-bar.test.com.au;
 rewrite ^/(.*)$ https://externalURL;
 ssl_certificate /etc/ssl/foo-bar.crt;
 ssl_certificate_key /etc/ssl/foo-bar.key;
 ssl_protocols TLSv1.2 TLSv1.3;
 ssl_ciphers HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5;

I've installed a series of ubiquiti access points/networking equipment (password protected wifi) around the yard and have fairly solid coverage. Some guys hopped the fence, stole a truck, rammed it through several garage doors, then out our fence.

They were in the yard at least 30 minutes prior to breaking the garage door which alerted myself/boss. The perpetrators …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have two office locations in front of each other. To connect the two offices, I’m planning on using some Ubiquiti AirFibre modules.
 For the purpose of the network, the AirFibre is like having an Ethernet cable between the two locations.
 Each of the two locations will have - Router - Switch - Separate and dedicated ISP internet connection
 Between these two locations, I would like to: - Access network resources that exist on either network - Use the other internet service as a backup
 My questions: 
  
How could I interconnect this? 
 What rules would I need to use?
  
Would: - “wireless cable 1” connect from network switch and LAN from office A to office B router - “wireless cable 2” from from network switch and LAN of office B to the office A router - setup a static route for the other office LAN on each office router to pass through the wireless link and to the other router - have a rule that passes WAN traffic normally through the local ISP, and through the wireless link interface if the ISP is down

 We have replaced the keyboard, mouse, and then the entire computer. The new PC was a clean image on a brand new computer taken out of the box for this. 
 The shift lock affects local physical users and remote control users over ConnectWiseControl. 
 At this point, I figure it has to be either some device plugged in that is screwing with the keyboard (this controls special hardware), or a bug in some piece of software needed on this computer. 
 We do not see this with otherwise identical computers and configurations around the org.
 We're going to try disconnecting all USB devices except for mouse and keyboard and see if it goes away, and do the old add them back one by one. But I had the idea that if there was something like Wireshark for USB, especially keyboard commands, it might narrow this down vs just blindly plugging things in.

 I am now 54 and pondering getting back in to Networking. I am thinking of doing some online courses and/or tutorials to get my CCNA and putting the feelers out but my worry is that I have lost too much knowledge & expertise and that my age will be a hinderance when seeking employment.

Users will get kicked off of their internet connection intermittently. This mostly occurs during video calls, especially if there are multiple people on the same call.
 Network setup: WAN: Verizon FIOS 1GB Router: TP-LINK ER7206 Switch: Netgear Prosafe: GS724TPv2 AP: Ubiquiti UniFi U6-LR-US
 This issue started about 6 months ago. The router I had then was a Cisco router and Aruba AP. I swapped both those out and have the configuration above.
 Was hoping someone had some ideas where to go next? Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just had the scariest 30 minutes.
 I'm at the office and decide to check my gmail and see that my NAS at home has been disconnected from the internet since midday. I figure our home internet has dropped out or there's been a power cut so decide to try and connect to the NAS over the internet anyway.
 Oh. It's up. That's weird. Why is it saying it's disconnected from the Internet then? Ah well, let's login and see what's going on. Enter credentials, enter the MFA code and "The verification code is incorrect"
 Um. WTF? Try a couple more times and MFA simply isn't working. There's no other admin account to login to (default admin account is disabled - I'm not a total idiot. Yes, yes I know, exposing NAS to the internet etc etc).
 I get my son, who's at home, to reboot the NAS hoping it's a temporary blip. Nope. Still cannot login as the MFA code isn't working.
 At this point my imagination is running wild and I'm assuming that it's been hacked and the MFA for my admin account has been reset to the hacker's phone. Other normal user accounts (non-MFA) are working. The data is still there, no encrypted files or anything else untoward seems to be going on. So, what the hell? 
 I check Synology forums and see posts about the time sync possibly being off but that isn't the case. I'm on the verge of asking my son to press the dreaded Reset button when I have a thought. I have a Active Directory domain at home and a single Zetec mini-PC box acting as DC. This also provides DNS for the home network. It couldn't be that could it? Why would that affect MFA on the NAS? 
 I get my son to check if the Zetec box is on. It wasn't. Soon as that was powered up and the DNS services started, MFA started working again. 
 Bloody DNS man....

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a temporary setup for allowing multiple network clients to access a shared VPN resource. I have a Windows PC connected to the internet and sharing it's VPN connection to a switch over ethernet and it's working very well for all connected devices. I've used this setup before and it's easy with everything else I have running. Right now, it's all wired. 
 My question is: if that were to be shared on open wifi instead of ethernet, what dangers to the host/"main" network would there be?
 I know that if I were using a normal router for this, I'd be concerned they would navigate to 192.168.1.1, enter a correct password or bypass an insecure login page, and wreak havok. So I would know that I need a secure router and a good password or I could put management on another VLAN. 
 I'm aware of possible concerns about peer security. Client isolation will be enabled in the access point to this network. 
 What concerns are there with Windows ICS "acting as the router"? Can clients configure ICS settings or somehow reach the Windows PC's primary LAN? Would they be able to send commands to the Windows PC?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently we are using a virtual data room solution that costs $6,000 for 2GB of storage and an additional $2000 per GB, so I am up to $8k annually. That seems really insane to me, and we are likely going to need to increase it to 4GB totaling 10K annually.
 I looked at other cloud storage solution providers, and for example, Box.com's Enterprise plan will allow me to only need to license internal users and all external users are free.
 With that, I could seemingly achieve the same thing for $2500 (5-6 internal users) instead of $8000. Not only that, but it includes unlimited storage as well which is a HUGE selling point to me.
 My use of our current data room solution solely exists to provide company financial files to investors. All that I need is activity audit logging, MFA, and granular permissions. It's used maybe once a year for a month or so during investor rounds, which makes the price tag even more painful.
 While we have SharePoint, I keep SharePoint use to internal only because its confusing to people, permission management is a PITA with external users, and audit reporting is no easy feat. I also want that clear delineation to employees to understand internal and external. I am just saying this so that I am not asked why I don't just use SharePoint for this.
 Is there something missing that I don't understand between the definition of a "data room" and just normal cloud storage setup to share with external/guest users?
 If you go look at Citrix ShareFile, theres specifically a data room tier that drops you from unlimited storage to 5GB of storage, and costs $448 a MONTH. Why is that a thing??
 Thanks!
 ​
 Edit: Based on the comments explaining the differences, it seems like we may be using a data room when we don't really need one for our specific purposes. I'll evaluate the other options. Thank you for the clarification!

 I just wanted to ask your feedback on this situation:
 I've been hired as a network engineer at a mid sized hospital organization, that also is looking for sysadmins.
 In the meantime, after working on network related tasks for about 8 months, I've been asked to assist with server security remediation. It's been understood that it's not a typical job role, but the whole IS team has been chipping in here and there and I certainly don't mind it given that its not all that much work.
 However, some of the maintenance cycles are scheduled for 10pm, on two Saturdays, and at 4am on the following two Sundays. 
 My question is, what server can possibly need to be updated at 4 in the morning? What's wrong with running both cycles simultaneously at 8pm during weekdays?
 Has anyone encountered this and can give any insight?
 Thanks!

Sorry, but I’m not going to train someone on all kinds of things I taught myself on my own time. And definitely not going to break my back when I’m on my way out.
 Edit: I will document important processes, complete any of my remaining tickets. However, I’m not going to train someone to be on my level when those people have already been there but didn’t take any initiative to learn.

I can ingress the domain and use any W10/W11 21H2 machine with no issues, and can ingress (using domain credentials) onto the domain with the 22H2 machine, but when I try to login with ANY domain user, it says the password is incorrect.
 I've set the minimum SMB version as SMB2 on Zentyal, but it didn't fix the issue.
 I'm not sure what can I do to investigate the issue further, as I don't receive eny error code.
 Does anyone have any suggestions on how to track the cause of the issue? 
 Edit: Seems it's related to this bug 15197 – Windows 11 22H2 and Samba-AD 4.15 Kerberos login issue with the solution being setting up a separate samba server for 22H2 machines, or not updating to 22h2 until the next Zentyal version releases. Fuck me

 a certain user experiences problems whenever he logs into the terminal server and does a query which produces a huge amount of rows. The query just crashes his whole desktop and file system. No files can be created and no paths found. Trying to close any program gives an error message that states the path of the program could not be found. 
 I also can't access his virtual hard drive as the path can't be found. The only solution is to log him out with task manager and relog into the server. 
 Is it possible that this could have something to do with too little memory on our volume? There are only a couple of MB left and this is the volume where all our virtual hard disks are stored.

 Our Org is planing to move direction cloud and implementing the usage of Microsoft 365 Services.
 One Point to calculate is backup. I am trying to find a good solution that is price effective. Actually i'm looking at some solutions like avepoint, Veeam, you name it ... there are dozens of BaaS (Backup as a Service) solutions out there. In a nutshell all works similar you pay per user and Month - and i don't like it this way. Call me Old bastard if you want :) 
 Later i stumbled across Synology "Active Backup for Microsoft 365". An app running on your local NAS (synology ones obviously). If i understood right, there is no additional licencing beside of "owning a compatible NAS". We have allready some of this maschines running without any trouble/issues for year as Cheap local Backup Storage Targets. 
 For me, there are two main important things. 1) Price and 2) Stability of the product. And i like to have backups "on-prem" the "classic" way (3 times and different places). 
 Now im wondering if i find here some "real life" Opinions about this setup? Any good for an organisation with 150 Users? 
 Thanx!

 At my work we use this internal service. To log in, we are given a URL with a random key. The key stays the same the whole time you work here. They claim this is secure because the key is random.

The same Printers are woking on my 2016 Server but we want a migratopn to 2019 Server. The Problem is, I can Print a Test page from each Server directly (2016 & 2019) but from my client ( Windows 10 ) i can normaly connect an view all settings with the printer, but i cant print on the 2019 Server.
 The 2019 Serve Log is:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We use a Windows 2016 server to run print jobs for our ERP system. All printing is direct - no print servers/sharing involved.
 For the past year, it seems like about 50% of Microsoft's updates breaks our printers. The exact scenario is: post-update, about 90% of the printers will have been defaulted to duplex printing, and about 90% of the printers will be using the generic Microsoft printer driver. (Note that these two groups do not always overlap; sometimes a printer will still have the correct driver, but will have been changed to duplex printing, or vice-versa.) This is not printer or driver specific; it occurs across several different makes/models and drivers.
 Fixing it is a relatively simple, but frustrating process: Just go into each printer's "Advanced > Printing Defaults..." and disable duplex. Afterwards, both issues will be resolved.
 We attempted to resolve this with a simple bit of Powershell, set to run (as admin) on system startup:
  $printers = Get-Printer foreach($printer in $printers){ Set-PrintConfiguration -PrinterName $printer.name -DuplexingMode 'OneSided' } 
 However, Set-PrinterConfiguration only works after the printer has been manually fixed. Otherwise, it generates the following error:
  Set-PrintConfiguration : Could not access configuration information for the specified printer. At C:\Scripts\Set_SingleSidedPrinting.ps1:7 char:5 + Set-PrintConfiguration -PrinterName $printer.name -DuplexingMode ... + ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ + CategoryInfo : ObjectNotFound: (MSFT_PrinterConfiguration:ROOT/StandardCi...erConfiguration) [Set-PrintConfiguration], CimException + FullyQualifiedErrorId : HRESULT 0x80070002,Set-PrintConfiguration 
 Very frustrating. Any ideas how to resolve things? Either so that Windows Updates no longer cause the printing issue, or so that our script can reliably run, post-update?

 The "new" Windows Terminal is everything i want. Except, sometimes, pasting passwords over SSH plain won't work. Pasting the Password without a sudo prompt or such shows the correct text, but when asked for a password by ansible or sudo, only typing does it. No idea why. It has also been laggy when connected to Servers with a less than ideal connection. Not sure why my Input depends on the connection to the customer?
 So, suffice to say, i'm not happy with windows Terminal. Alacritty does everything great, except it doesn't have tabs.
 Putty also doesn't have tabs plus it's session management is... less than ideal.
 So, what do i do? My requirements are pretty basic. All Windows stuff can be done through PS. So all i really need is something that can do SSH, Tabs, maybe split windows. Stored sessions are a nice to have, but i'm fine copy pasting IPs and using my SSH config. Right Click Paste would be nice, but Ctrl+V works too. It should use Windows' build in OpenSSH, not putty and Pageant. Other than that, it should be responsive and work as expectet 100% of the time.
 What do those of you that Use SSH for admin tasks all day, but also need to use Windows, use?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use to be a real go-getter. I'd be up at 7:00 am, I'd be scripting, I'd be documenting, I'd be on calls helping out people, I'd be helping teammates even if they didn't ask for it, I'd volunteer for tasks, I'd be working late or on the weekends trying to get something done or working the way I wanted it.
 Now? Fuck all that.
 I did that for years, and I'd see people getting promoted and then try to figure out what I did wrong. Or at the end of the year my review comes back with all 'meets', and just get the standard raise. At my third job, it hit me like a baseball in the nuts with a simple comment from another co-worker. 
 "Why, the boss didn't tell me to do it"
 It's that simple. All your manager is interested in is that you getting done what he or she assigned to you. Spending 12 hours making sure that documentation is just right might get you a "good job" comment from the manager and might get you the recognization of being a good document writer but you know what a quick bullet list you did in 20 minutes will tick that task complete and that is what your manager is interested in
 After I got that concept through my head my life in IT became a cakewalk and more important my salary has tripled over the past 10 years (and pretty much no overtime). 
 That's not to say I don't do anything extra. I spend a fair amount of time studying but I take a two-pronged approach. First, learn what is needed for the current job, the processes, the tech stack, the DBs etc. That is usually a month or two then, as I like to change jobs or get promoted every 2 or max 3 years I start studying for the job I want next. 
 I no longer waste my time trying to be the go-getter, the superstar, or that person everyone goes to for the answers cause at the end of the day it's just a job and I'm going to get paid the same to write an amazing doc or a bulleted list.
 Also, remember the rule of 5. How will it affect you in 5 minutes, 5 weeks, 5 months, or 5 years?

When I ask for something and it's expensive, he simply asks me to explain so that he can chose the better option. He's also excellent with Excel, so all the Excel related questions go to him.

 During the day, no issues at all, even at peak times like 12 PM or the evening.
 Since this is affecting presumably the entire state, I doubt anything will change to fix it.
 My question though is... why? An ISP phone technician will be unlikely to tell me, so I'm just curious if there would be any likely cause for these issues? Are they doing updates to their routers that just randomly knocks everyone off the Internet deep at night?
 I'm also curious if anyone else has had experiences like this themselves?

 One lady with poor vision almost crying when I took a screen magnifier to her and set it up, who just stared at it going "wow" over and over with a huge smile.
 The kids with learning disabilities who got touch screen iMacs which blew their mind and who wrote a theme some (based on Batman) which they sang anytime they saw me.
 The doctor who actually got down on his knees and kissed my feet (I was with a colleague at the time) after I fixed his long-problematic monitor issues (it was literally 5 mins to download/reinstall an Nvidia driver). He said he'd had over a dozen calls and six IT staff at his computer by this point.
 I'm going to be honest I'm easily pleased but when you do make a difference and see that impact on someone else it reminds some of us why we chose to work in support.

 When searching online with Google etc. i find some companies which are operating in the US or basic guides on how to label your cables. Not exactly what i need.
 Do any of you have experience with some of the suppliers in the region of The Netherlands, Benelux or even Europe? And can recommend me a supplier?

 I've got 99,4% of my users "affected by policies that are configured securely".
 But I've got 0.6% of my users " affected by policies that are configured less securely than is recommended ". 
 How do I go about finding these users? 
 Are there any good or efficient way of finding these users?
 I'm just thinking there's something I'm missing here:

 They even list how many users that are affected by the wrong (Default) policies. So my thinking is that I should be able to find these users in a list somehow.

 Head Office (HO): Sophos XGS Firewall (For troubleshooting all security between the two offices is temporarily disabled)
 Branch Office (BO): Mikrotik 915G
 IPSEC configured between the sites.
 Printers at the branch office are connected via the VPN to the windows terminal server located in HO.
 BO staff connect to HO Terminal server and print documents from their application to their local printers. Printing is taking about 1 minute per page 200kb(according to the spooler) to print. The connectivity appears stable and i dont see packet loss across the link and there is about 70ms between the two. I've performed packet captures from the BO Side and the HO Side. I was hoping to get some indication of where and if the fault is with the link. Also note, we have 3 other BO's connected to the HO with the exact same setup and no performance issues.
 After the initial handshake i see a large number of retransmissions from the HO Side with ACKs from the printer in the BO. This continues for about 15 seconds before a number of back and forwards of packets . After this, 10 seconds of what appears to be healthy communication occurs. I get a TCP Window full from the HO server to the BO Printer. The as well the ad the retransmissions and dup ACK returning. It continues this way for the next 20 seconds before a another flood of what appears to be healthy PSH/ACK communication. Finally ending in the FIN/ACK.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. Just a stupid question.
 I have multiple VMs running in an isolated network and want them to isolate, but I'd like to access them through the VPN connection. So as a solution I'm going to use one VM with the public IP, set up a firewall, and OpenVPN server. Also, I'm going to add authentication for the OpenVPN through the OpenLDAP server and redirect all routing for the VMs from the isolated network using this primary VM. So this primary VM will work as a router.
 So what kind of OS should I use for it?
 For now, I have created an ansible playbook that set up everything required using Ubuntu Server LTS. But I've read that Ubuntu is OS for the users and it's better to use BSD family OSes like OpenBSD, FreeBSD, or even OPNsense for the network devices.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, sorry I'm not following any SecOps subs so not too comfortable posting elsewhere.
 We've been using the Windows Server CIS L1 benchmarks for a while, but are now looking to roll them out to some Citrix servers. On the surface nothing in the benchmark policies seem problematic for users, but I'm concerned that there may be additional User Rights Assignment type permissions required in the Citrix context.
 Has anyone used the CIS policies in a Citrix environment and can speak to any issues, or alterations they had to make to the policies to allow things to work properly?
 Cheers

 "With backup schedule set to Hourly, the default selection for start time is 8 AM, schedule is Every 4 hours, and duration is 24 Hours. Hourly backup has a minimum RPO of 4 hours and a maximum of 24 hours. You can set the backup schedule to 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours respectively."
 Recovery point objective (RPO): The amount of acceptable data loss if a recovery needs to be done
 Azure support hourly VM backup, however their RPO indicates that the schedule is a minimum of every 4 hours.
 So is a backup performed every 1 or 4 hours? Or are they saying that even through you've set to hourly we will only guarantee a backup every 4 hours? If so than that's somewhat poor.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We live in Canada and the last couple of Winters we have been getting more and more power losses due to storms. We average about 10-15 over the Fall/Winter season, and they often last for several hours.
 I recently identified an issue with a UPS we have (Cyberpower) where it does not take over immediately upon power loss, so the last few winters when I thought it was taking over, our Dell PowerEdge R220 server has been shutting off (not gracefully) every power outage.
 I am working on getting a good UPS in place with network SNMP traps that is more reliable -- thinking Tripp Lite as I have had good luck with them in the past. Let me know if there is anything specific I should be looking for when it comes to UPS purchases for a small server rack for a local business with a server, NAS, modem, and a couple other small devices.
 I was thinking something along the lines of https://www.cdw.ca/product/tripp-lite-1000va-ups-smart-avr-w-installed-webcardlx-1urm/3826234?pfm=srh
 For the server itself... we currently have WD GOLD 3.5" Enterprise HDD in there. Would there be any advantage to power loss data prevention by switching to the WD GOLD SSD with the power loss prevention feature? I have been looking for an excuse to move them over to SSDs, but only if it is a good safe guard against power loss. I know standard SSDs are not good for power loss protection, but are SSDs with power loss protection any better than the WD GOLD Enterprise HDDs I mentioned?
 The server we have also has an H310 raid controller and I was wondering if switching to H710p would offer any advantages to maintaining data integrity during a power outage? I understand the performance and IOPS difference between the two but not sure if one is better than the other for handling power loss.
 There's lots more info I could provide but just doing a quick write up for now.

 I work for a mid size documentary company in NYC. For the last two years our data closet has sat gathering dust, and I got fed up with a perfectly good 80TB of shared storage sitting unused. So I took a photo of all the various serial numbers, brute-forced the passwords (they were all the defaults - go figure), and bought the company’s first PC to see what I could do.
 Here’s a list of the equipment on our rack from top to bottom: - D-Link DGS-1210-16 (not connected to anything) - 24-port RJ45 patch box (connected to below switch, labeled “LAN”) with cat6 cables running to stations - HP1920-48G network switch (labeled “LAN S”) - 24-port RJ45 patch box (connected to below switch, labeled “PHONE”, the phones and their breadboard-looking-box have been removed) - CISCO Catalyst switch (Labeled “PHONE S”) - NETGEAR ProSafe XS712T switch (with one fiber expansion port, connected via fiber to NAS, and Ethernet to LAN, second NAS) - 24-port RJ45 patch box with mix of Cat 5e, 6, and 6e ports that run to CAT7 cables to edit stations - Synology DS1618+ - Synology DS3617xs
 My goal is to get an office network up and running with the CAT7 lines running 10Gb to edit stations and Cat6 lines running 1Gb to producers stations. From there, I want to host a server for Signiant Media Shuttle that will allow my NAS both through my router’s firewall and to the office network. I presume this means it all has to go through either the 10Gb or 1Gb switch (or both?). My office has 1Gb fiber through Verizon, and we have their router.
 If anyone out there has any advice for me, or can point me to good resources, I would greatly appreciate it.

 What are some good places where I could do the odd weekend or evening working remotely freelance? I moved jobs a few months ago from a hands on technical role with a very broad skill set to more of a team lead / architect role in the cloud space. I honestly miss jumping from fixing a broken DC to patching a RHEL template to creating new segments in NSX-T. I can also feel my broad skill set fading away already and I don’t like the idea of being an IT manager in 10 years time struggling to remember what DNS does!
 So do you any of you do any remote freelance work at the weekend and if so how can I get involved? I only see it as a win win, it keeps my skills sharp and I’m getting paid!
 Thanks for your replies

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 I have a mostly WFH job in IT which requires the occasional local onsite visit. However, recently my company have mentioned they want to potentially send me to a large city that is roughly 6 hours away (flying or driving, all travel is expensed) for a week out of every month for a project that’s expected to last a year or longer. 
 Travel time are hours that go on the timesheet to make up my 40 hours for the week. A hotel and car will be provided. All work related expenses can be expensed if I provide a receipt. If driving my own car, I can expense the gas at .55c/km, which adds a nice small bump to my pay cheques.
 My main concern is that a quarter of my year will be spent away from home and family. I don’t have kids, only a girlfriend who would miss me being home but can deal with it. After a while, I don’t think I will really be able to enjoy my leisure time when the day is finished if I cannot go home to relax. 
 It would be a decent learning experience but it’s experience I could get locally as well. I make under $60k CAD (~45k USD) in Ontario.
 I enjoy my job but feel they are asking a bit much of me. My boss implied that travel is part of the job but I feel that there needs to be additional monetary compensation.
 Do any of you guys receive compensation for this type of extended travel for long projects? What do you think should I be asking for? Is it just part of the job? 
 Thanks in advance for any input.

A lot of what I do is troubleshooting and proving the network is not the cause of X issue. It would be nice to not have to answer to end users and just focus on building stuff.
 Has anyone else felt this way? Maybe this is just a grass is always greener situation. I'm in my mid-30's and feel like I'm too old to transition to SE.

 I get that this post too is off topic but is to address an issue with the sub, not I hate my life/boss/job/world.

 It is sad to see that so many people can't distinguish between an invitation to discuss the content of this sub and it's moderation, and a rant.

 Currently, I just run all the WordPress sites on my server directly and they all share one MySQL/MariaDB instance. However, sometimes there are things to be done via ssh, or they want a db dump or a backup etc.
 I was wondering if anyone could think of a good way how I can give those people more access to their own WordPress sites without giving them access to the server or other people's sites with the least work for me. I was thinking of deploying WordPress and MySQL in a docker container and just installing ssh in that docker container so everyone could access their own container?

 I have to write a document describing IT infrastructure of a real-world company/business including hardware, software, network components and deciding whether to use cloud infrastructure or tradition infrastructure with on premises servers. I decided to choose car dealership company which would be small and more specific to design. We are allowed to design it as we think rather than finding the actual infrastructure of the chosen company. My chosen company is John Hughes which is a car dealership business here Australia, Perth, WA. 
 Any input on how to approach the design, components to think of and what components or how actual IT infrastructure looks like for a car dealership business would be highly appreciated. They would need support for inventory management, sales, customer relations but what else should I be thinking of.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been looking into this for a while now, and still coming up short. We're a non-profit in a small country with horrible internet access. Our 4 locations are basically small, gated cities. The big center has essentially the leadership (government), a medical clinic, a store, a school, and 70 residences. Nearby is the airport and aviation team. The other 3 remote locations are each about 10 homes and an office. Each center relies on a single internet connection for everything (houses, et al) at that location.
 We have an IT team of only 6, all at the central location. Our documentation is old, disorganized, and thus hard to go through and find what you need. I think we're making progress though.
 Computers are a mixed bag of domain computers and BYOD. Letting a tool scan the network has always given unwieldy results or so many results there's not a clue where to start.
 The issue is that we have no idea WHAT we're managing, and that needs to change. We've setup a trial of iDoit and had a go. It's a nice tool, but perhaps too manual. We have PRTG that can help, but it's got so many alarms from "false" devices found during the auto-scan.
 The question is...what are others using for inventory and documentation? I'm looking for a tool that can tell me what devices are where with what configuration. Hopefully, something that can schedule maintenance and show a change history.
 I've been googleing on and off for months, finding a lot of sales pitches and promises. Maybe a short trial, maybe not. I'm hoping that by asking here, perhaps the options can be twiddled down to a good couple instead of what I'm (not) finding.

 I have successfully completed it as directed in the guide. The emails are being received on Gmail. However, my emails sent from custom email addresses are going to junk (outlook) and promotional tab (Gmail).
 I think the problem here is: DKIM record. I don't think Google allows to access the keys for a simple Gmail user. One has to sign in to Workspace which I think is not free.
 I have tested with an email tester.
 https://app.mailgenius.com/spam-test/5ecbb9
 How do I proceed with this?
 My goal is:
  
To send/receive domain emails on Gmail instead of using a custom SMTP.
 I prefer the freebie approach. Do let me know if there's any free SMTP that allows sending around 3000 emails/month.

 They've been licensed since day one, we use an assortment of Basic/Standard M365 licenses, they've never been deactivated or stripped of their license.
 The only thing that comes to mind and they have in common is every single one of them has had their licensing upgraded from Basic to Standard at some point.
 Everyone on the initial license plan is not affected, they have their Teams according to their M365 license.
 Has anyone encountered this behaviour? I'm not able to reproduce it while switching licensing plans for a user.

Could not utilize SCCM instead, could not switch to a non-MS solution 'because'. The imaging solution was not meant for this, it was meant for something more basic. Regardless, after some initial training from the local Egg I did what I needed to keep this system afloat. I was "the guy" though I didn't like it because I knew there were better solutions out there. Also, people at the other end were messing things up despite us training them. (They got better after a while, that eventually worked out.)

 Build a nonblocking and Fault-Tolerant network that accommodates 10,000 servers equipped with two 10Ge NICs.
 ​
 My answer, 
 To make it Fault-Tolerant I will have two routers between the routers on the client side and the external router which will be connected with other ASs. Configure one as the active and the other as the standby. The two routers will use Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol to achieve this.
 I wasn't able to say anything about which product to use so I said any router and switch that has 10Ge ports.

 Actual cell service has been getting worse and worse, especially since the 5G rollout. Anyone else notice this too? 
 T-Mobile is offering us and a buddy of mine in charge of a similar size account some unbeatable deals and savings to switch over to them. I’m a little reluctant because historically TMO has had less than great coverage than the big 2. But I think that has changed, at least from the testing I have done, I’m seeing better speeds and better coverage in most areas now. We do work all over our state, so it’s important that we have good coverage. 
 Am I making a mistake switching over to a smaller provider? Do you think I’ll have to deal with backlash? 
 My idea is to switch over 100+ iPads first since data on those isn’t a deal breaker like it would be for voice service. And do remote monitoring to see what the signal is in the areas we work, then if it’s a good fit, change over our smartphones. 
 Anyone else switch their company over and do you have any regrets?
 I don’t consider AT&T a viable option at this point as their 5G rollout is so far behind and I did a bunch of testing last year and was not impressed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We've just had a new CCTV Camera system added to our corporate WLAN by an external 3rd party vendor. The system streams 12 odd cameras to a heads-up display. Its scope was to be viewed on a wired device at a Station but it's found its way to mobile devices (Tablets/Laptops) due to the flexibility and convenience this offers. Unfortunately, it doesn't optimize video well and is constantly eating around 100 Mbps (or more) per client. Our Wireless network is a Cisco-based WLC /w 802.11ac WAPs using 20 MHz wide channels for 2.4/5 GHz. So we're really only good for about 100 Mbps half-duplex. 
 I've been doing some thinking about the problem and I cannot see if we can resolve this with the current Wireless setup even if we moved to wider channel widths or newer 802.11 technology. Not only would wider channels hurt the setup of the entire building but even with 2 clients, we're going to have sub-optimal performance for all other clients in that airspace.
 Am I just underestimating the performance of the newer standard 802.11ac/802.11ax, or is this use-case better suited for Wired?

 Is it not designed to allow multiple SRPs and everything is supposed to be in one? One of them applies to a wider user base than the other, which is why there are two separate GPOs.
 Edit: I see that it is actually allowed but happens when it thinks there is a conflict so the better question is- why does it think there is a conflict? One of them is the path to Firefox, the other is the path to Zoom. Two different locations entirely. I'm not understanding where the conflict is.

 So when I enter app1.tunnel.example.com sometimes it is redirected to 1.1.1.1 server and sometimes to 2.2.2.2
 app1.tunnel.example.com, app2.tunnel.example.com..etc are dynamically generated, these are tunnels to privateIP exposed service, and the other end of the tunnel, the publicIP part from which you have access on the internet, is either server-1 1.1.1.1 or server-2 2.2.2.2, depending on which IP tunnel.example.com DNS has returned (load balancing between the 2 IPs)
 My problem is that sometimes the tunnel for app1.tunnel.example.com is on Server 1, but when acessing this host, the loadbalancer routes this traffic to server 2, and it results on an error
 I have actually made nginx reverse proxy to the end of the tunnel, sith proxy_pass
 What I want, I don't know if it's possible with Nginx, is if the proxied server returns 404 on server 1, then re-route the request to the other nginx reverse-proxy server 2, but the URL has to remain app1.tunnrl.example.com on the search bar, 
 is it even networkingly possible? If yes and nginx is not the answer, then what could it be?
 Below is How I want the nginx.conf to look like on server1:
 Server { Listen 80; Location / { proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:4444/; proxy_intercept_error on; } error_page 404 = @redirect; location @redirect { return 301 http://$host ON 2.2.2.2; #host here is app1.tunnel.example.com } }

 I've just started a new job in a busy hospital laboratory, and sooo much time could be saved if the normal values just auto-verified in the computer without a lab tech having to pull it up in the computer, scan it, then hit verify to send the results to the EMR. Right now, only some of their chemistry tests auto-verify, so I know it's possible. I'm gathering that the IT department there is notoriously slow (likely understaffed and not exactly giving priority to some lab passion project, understandably).
 Lab is on Cerner Millenium. I'm assuming that the set-up for this occurs in Cerner, but how? I've been taking some basic developing courses and would be happy to do this on the side as a portfolio project, but I don't even know if that's possible or where to start. Obviously I'd have to talk to IT at some point but hoping to get some input here before I even bring it up (in case it's absolutely crazy).
 As a side note, their Cepheid (COVID instrument) is not interfaced to Cerner at all, so they're manually typing in the 100s of Flu/COVID/RSVs they get in a day and then having a 2nd tech do a clerical check, which is absolutely bananas for the volume they get. If anyone knows where to start on that one as well, I'd love to attempt to tackle it if it's even remotely possible.
 TIA (and sorry if this is the wrong sub - I also posted in r/healthIT but not sure if that was right either - please redirect me)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm a hardware engineer at some company. We have a device we collect data with that spits data out to a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi has compiled code on it that saves the data to its local files and sends these files back to a lab PC over a closed wifi network. None of these devices are connected to the internet.
 During our testing, we're using Matlab to perform our testing procedures. Our auxiliary hardware is all reliant on proprietary Matlab drivers.
 To send commands to the RPi, we currently use Matlab to make a system call to Putty, which SSH's into the RPi and executes local code on the RPi. We need to do this hundreds of times per test, and it currently takes a couple seconds per Putty call, so the time stacks up. To push/pull files off the RPi, we have Matlab make a system call to an SFTP server.
 My question is: how would you execute the commands on the RPi faster than making system calls to Putty? My scenario to test speed is to execute a copy file command from Matlab 20 times, and time the results. Number to beat is about 40 seconds for those 20 copies. I've tried using the Paramiko library in Python, but it was slower than Putty. I've also tried using a 3rd party Matlab plugin based around the Ganymede Java library, but there's some problem with keys on our model of Rpi, even when I manually try to add keys to the RPi. My next move is a Python library called ssh2-python, but I need to get Visual on the lab PC, which will take some time given our IT situation.
 I was also toying with the idea of using TCP sockets in either Python or C++, but I'm not really familiar with TCP. I'm not a network person, so I'm kind of blindly stumbling from potential solution to potential solution. Thoughts?

 I‘m currently playing around with TLS ans self-signed certificates for internal services. There are quite a lot of tutorials on how to generate a root ca and an intermediate CA, while there are also Howtos for generating TLS certificates.
 As far as I understood, you sign the CSR of your intermediate by your root ca and your SSL csr by your intermediate CA. You import and trust the root ca and every certificate signed by the intermediate should be trusted too.
 Well. That doesn’t work. If I, for example, check the certificate of google with MacOS Certificate Assistant, the whole chain of trust is visible. If I check my certificate, I only see the TLS cert and the assistant cries about the untrusted intermediate certificate.
 It looks like the chain between root and intermediate is broken. If read the Wikipedia article about x509 and the lead me to more questions. It looks like the certificate only contents some basic information about it’s ca (in my case the intermediate) like public key ,algorithm, etc. but no information about the root ca. How ist my browser supposed to know who signed the intermediate ?
 Or is the information on Wikipedia not complete and I have to bundle the CAs certificates with my TLS cert ?
 I have an headache now. Please help me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 At my job, I'm in charge of developing a solution to a very disorganized team's bottlenecks. 
 One thing I've noted is that they use a Windows share for file storage when their volume is well behind what I feel that's meant to handle. They have a root directory with 115k (at present) folders that all have six or seven files a piece. The files are necessary for the cases they're working, and the 115k items in their inventory account for 3 months worth of work. The file share will lag for up to a minute before loading on occasion.
 I don't have experience in this area, but I'm certain there has to be a better solution than this.
 What would you recommend?

 IPsec functions correctly, but employees have to manually enable it in settings... Plus, they should not have access to disable it in the first place.... so, has anyone had success with always-on VPNs? if not, how could we remotely access services on our managed devices?

 Manually speaking, The driver consists of 4 files that are inside a .cab file, once extracted from the cabinet, the installation involves running cmd as an admin and using pnputil on one of the files to install.
 ​
 How would i go about deploying this to the company portal through intune?
 I tried extracting the .cab on my machine and making a .intunewin file from the directory with the install command utilizing the pnputil command, but it doesnt seem to do anything, the installation fails immediately.
 i also tried making the .intunewin from the .cab itself, also without success
 ​
 any ideas how i should go about this issue?
 a powershell script seems to be the answer, but im not much of a powershell scripter :\
 ​
 ** The whole point of this is that non-admin users could install those drivers without needing to open cmd as admin

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been having some thoughts lately about the point I’m at in my career and comparisons with colleagues and friends at various points in their career. One thing I’ve realized with myself is that I’m always too modest about my achievements and efforts. I downplay anything that I’ve done that goes above and beyond and brush off any praise I receive as “just doing my job”. I try too hard to not be the big showboating guy gloating about how many goals I’m kicking and don’t want anything to think that I’m bragging about something. 
 I feel like there’s a difference between being proud of a big achievement and making a huge deal out of something that was really minor. Looking around though I see people that are shameless about claiming credit for something that they both had very little to do with and also really isn’t that important in the grand scheme of things so they get ahead. Is modesty seen as a weakness in career endeavors?

 How exactly would I setup 2 Unifi Switches to connect to the Ha firewalls and be completely redundant? Ie either firewall or either switch could die and it still works. https://ibb.co/2dYMPc7
 Am I right in my design or is there a better way given the equipment I'm dealing with?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Our org is 100% Cloud - all in on O365. We use SharePoint for file management and many of our staff use the onedrive app to sync folders to their pc's. Twice this year (so far), users have deleted massive folders/files (10-50k files) because they wanted to get rid of the sync'd folder on their pc - when they should have simply stopped the sync in the onedrive app.
 As you can imagine, doing massive restores from the recycle bin is extremely time consuming and it's tricky restoring from our cloud backup provider as it's usually not the entire site that is deleted.
 I was hoping MS had a policy we could set to stop bulk deletions (max deletions at a time = 20 or something along those lines), but from what i read and what MS support tells me, the only way to stop these deletion is to remove 'delete' permissions from all of our permissions, except for a select few staff. This also appears to disable renames as well.
 Is that truly the only way to stop this from occurring? Are there any O365 SharePoint settings to stop deletions in general? 
 Thanks for your input!

 It seems to be something within our own setup as the peering backbones are not having this issue at all.
 What are best practices for testing and figuring out where the issue may lie?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I started a new job and in a process of modernizing my network. The current network is a huge layer2 domain. The customers are in R&D and use a lot of multicast and broadcast. I am planning to turn this network into layer3 since 90% of our traffic is east-west. I am thinking to implement the spine-leaf topology. And utilize vrf-lite for each customer. My network is spread between five different buildings. The farthest building is probably 3000ft away from the main one. Also, the fiber between buildings is either OM1 except for the farthest one.
 It seems like I am going to be using Cisco C9300 and C9500 (or maybe 1u Nexus switch)
  
Can I use C9300 as leaf switches?
 Can I use C9500 for my spines?
  
I am thinking to deploy a couple of leaf switches to each build. I am not sure if this is a good idea or not. My understanding of the spine-leaf network, the vrf-lite exists only at the leaf level. If I have a tenant that happened to be located at two different buildings, the tenant's VLANs will be extended via vxlan / l2vpn. Am I right about this? Does the VLAN in bldg A need to match the VLAN ID in bldg B for the same tenant?
 Also, I am still wrapping my head how the routing between tenants. Since each tenant will be placed in a vrf-lite, then I would have to use route-leaking. Do I need to create an ACL on the leaf switches if the traffic between tenants must be restricted based on their applications (e.g. ssh, ftp, etc.) only?
 For my infrastructure, servers (AD, NTP, DNS, DHCP, ISE etc), Docker containers, end-users, and oob (ipmi and network management), should I put these on their own vrf-lite or should I put them on the master/default table? What is the best practice for infrastructure?
 ​
 Thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello folks,
 I'm just curious on what other network engineers thoughts are on ciscos SD wan.
 Specifically, if you've worked with it, have you implemented it, or taken over?
 What components of it do you use?
 What do you like about it?
 In what situation would it be the best bet to deploy and why?
 How much does your org spent on it? What caused them to pay for it?
 The way I see it, the SD WAN full deployment is a super expensive system that completely is maintained by licensing, even though the equipment can technically perform the job already.
 Thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do networking for a client who is trying to set up a new VOIP service. The VOIP provider said they'll require a public IP handoff. The client has an available public IP in their static block. I configured the client firewall to use one of those static IPs and Im trying to think of the best way to set up this handoff. Current set up below:
 Coax > Modem > Ethernet > Router > Ethernet > Firewall. 
 The connection from the ISP router to the firewall is connected to one of the ISP router's switch ports. My opinion is its probably best to plug the VOIP provider's device needing a public IP directly into one of the other ISP router's switch port. It doesn't seem practical to try to put the VOIP device behind the firewall because that would need some SNAT config and it needs to be public facing. 
 What do you think? Still green at this so any/all input is appreciated. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The job market for sys admin/ IT support is absolutely wrecked right now. I am shocked to see 1-200 applicants on every job listing and starting to get very discouraged. I hold multiple cloud certs too and I am barely getting any responses back. Seems like 3 months ago recruiters were bothering me non stop. I was even told 2 days ago for an IT sec analyst/IAM role for 80/k a year (local company too) that I am OVERQUALIFIED as a sys admin. What the hell man…I hope it’s better by January because this is super discouraging. Rant over :(

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[10 years ago i ran our server team, and retired our last 2003 server. it had lived a long life because it ran our ticketing system, and even after it was replaced, there were links back to it at the database level for some fixed asset information that the new system did not directly support, so the app devs wrote a little tool to get data from there for "this last year we need that before we setup our new web replacement". during my time with it (7 years) it went from physical to virtual as well. it had a long life.
 i moved on to back end app support, new people took over servers, devs finished their replacement in 2 years instead of less than 3 months and the server can be turned off right? sure. 
 then there were some VM host issues, some data storage problems, VMware helped the new server team recover everything, and the server re-appears. as i am recovering some of the systems i support, i notice the name and let them know, they delete it again. 
 forward 2 years, some update fails, working with VMware again to fix things, pops back into existence. I notice it... again. 
 more issues.... reappears...
 again..
 today is the 7th time in 10 years i have seen this fucking server that wont die. 
 I think its taunting me. oh, and my co-workers are incompetent.

 From what my new manager tells me, the ticket queue for escalations from help desk is usually empty, projects are the bulk of the work, and I’ll be owning a handful of systems and network components.
 I can’t wait for less end user support, more technical work, and better pay. I’m nervous as hell but excited to get started!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've managed my organization's Adobe licensing for over 3 years now, and I can't express enough how much I fucking loathe dealing with this company.
 Every single renewal has been plagued by licensing issues, and Adobe employees know fuck all about their own software. If I'm instructed to log out and back into an Adobe ID as a resolution one more time, I swear to fuck something is getting burnt down. Issues are inconsistent; some users can use the entire suite, others none of it, a few can use everything besides Acrobat. Even worse, my licensing provider will tell me something is included (such as Adobe Sign) and Adobe tells me that it isn't.
 So that leaves me, stuck in the middle, screaming like an absolute Karen, "We paid for licensing, fucking fix it!" I feel as if I'm screaming into the void, with no solution in sight, all the while staff can't perform their duties from lack of access.
 Has anyone experienced similar issues with this shit-show of a company or has any suggestions? Neither Adobe or my licensing provider has been able to provide a fix in over a month, and I'm at wits end.
 Edit: So fun fact, Adobe Sign doesn't come with Creative Cloud K-12 Shared Device licensing, so if an Adobe employee tells you otherwise, you call them a damn dirty liar. It took A MONTH for Adobe to figure that out. Guess we can't even expect them to do sales correctly either.

 Often when moving things around I have to troubleshoot connectivity issues on the FC clients by looking for the beam of light in patch panels, HBAs, etc…. This is probably very not good for my eyes which are already not great to deal with. 
 Is there some sort of tool I can get that’ll allow me to plug it into a LC port and confirm signal without having to blind myself? Or am I overthinking the dangers of staring into light??
 Also on the copper side, I’m trying to see if there’s a tool I can plug into a RJ45 port to see if its unpatched, which switch it’s patched to, and if there’s a cable failure somewhere down the line.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Community, 
 Full disclaimer: I am not an IT-professional but rather a user seeking advice since the field im in is quite sparse with IT professionals in the "middle-ground" and my go-to IT guy rarely deals with the bandwith/use-cases I work in.
 I do own a small post-production studio (1-3 users) which is currently based on 10 Gigabit Ethernet (speaking Cisco SG-X series) connections with Intel/ATTO NICs. I have 3-4 Workstations with 2-3 file-servers and an LTO-Library working in parallel all using 10Gbase. 
 I want/need to upgrade this to fiber to reduce energy-costs and to future-proof the setup and be able reach 25GB speeds (only with some flash/NVME applications/transfers).
 Due to the recent energy costs in europe and the implementation of more network applications (Adder Infinity KVM and Dante audio-networking in my case) I was thinking thinking If I could consolidate the switches and instead run everything in the studio with one (core)switch?
 If that is a terrible idea - let me know. 
 I thought about investing into an FS.Com Switch* like the S5860-48SC, but of course I already read here that people are still sceptic about the software/interface. 
 *(If I recall correctly most switches nowadays are white-labels and every vendor applies their firmware/implementation?)
 Any advice on how to future proof upgrade from 10G is appreciated.
 Since I already run my video on fiber I can easily upgrade the whole facility to fiber step by step since I am due to rewiring anyways. 
 If my post fails to live up to the rules of this subreddit just let me know before deleting.
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a small VXLAN/EVPN environment (2 spines, 4 leafs/2 VPC pairs) that was built greenfield with DCNM 11.5(4). I was recently having connectivity issues between DCNM and the switches and to troubleshoot TAC support had me remove one of the leaf switches from DCNM, which then warned me about and removed it's VPC partner as well.
 After we resolved the connectivity issue, we attempted to add back in both leaf switches (preserving config) and it's throwing this error.
 "Cannot add a Brownfiled switch [serial number] to the fabric unless all existing switches are pending Brownfiled migration."
 I read this as I need to remove the other 4 switches and try adding them back all in at once as brownfield preserving config.
 Has anyone had to do this or run into this error before? Will the config actually be preserved and not cause any issues? Will I lose all my logged fabric changes since greenfield config or will it pick back up where I left off? Thanks.

I'm the one who is responsible for responding to security incidents and I'm accountable in a lot of ways for keeping the doors shut tight. When someone goes wrong, I'm the person they ask to fix it, I'm the one giving updates, and I'm the one suggesting and implementing changes when it's over.
 VIPs made a last minute request to install a VPN onto their personal devices ASAP. I questioned this and was told it's fine, but it isn't sitting well with me. I'm thinking about bringing it up a level because if a user did this I'd be pissed.
 I suggested consumer VPNs and reminded my manager that we know nothing about these devices, have not given any instructions on the use of the VPN, and this will expose our secure network which in all other circumstances we are very protective of. 
 Usually this manager can see reason, I'm not really getting this. It's like I'm talking to an end user. One of the VIPs doesn't even work in our company, it's a friend.
 I'm just doing it, but we go through so much effort to keep our network secure, jumping through hoops and implementing rigorous compliance standards, rolling out lengthily policies and reworking our internal processes to avoid creating gaps like this, only for what... some VIPs want to go on vacation and can't pay $10 for a month of Mozilla VPN.

We're a small local college looking to provide wifi access to students in some of our parking lots for after hours or pandemic restrictions. We would hang these on the outside second floor of buildings that border the selected parking lots. Our network is all Meraki (switches and inside AP) and can support the outdoor AP with either copper or fiber. Parking lots average about 200' x 200' and we can hang up to 3 or 4 AP's on most of the buildings facing the lots. So what is suggested for such an application?

Go to website foo and download foo.app.gz [link is broken] "Oh, yeah, it's a git download." [git link doesn't work] "Try this other link."
 Unzip foo.app.gz, go into the "install" directory, and run "setup.sh" [there is no "install directory" nor is there a "setup.sh"]
 "Oh yeah, run 'configure' then 'make all'." "There is no makefile." "You have to download that separately on another website, I forget where." "Okay, that's pretty vital." "Ask Dan."
 "Did Jim tell you to run configure? No no, run 'setup.sh' and ... there is no setup? When did they remove that?" "Who is 'they', here?" "Let me see what's going on, share your screen.... oh, I have never seen THAT before. Did you run brew bar-app-libs?" "This is a Linux box, not a Mac." "Okay, well, there is a Homebrew for linux, so get that..."
 "I know that Jenkins said every build has failed, but ignore that, and download this weird obscure package manager..."
  
And so on. I remember one developer was so mad his docker build didn't work, he said, "I thought you said you knew Linux?" and I wanted to punch him. He couldn't get it to work, either, and blamed my environment. And after I looked at his dockerfile, there was no way it would have worked; even the syntax was wrong.

 How do you keep your AD user employee details up do date? 
 All the employee metadata in the user account like Job Title, Department, Company, Manager name, phone numbers, address etc. might be superfluous in a basic org but become more useful when AD SSO is integrated with other enterprise systems such as Helpdesk that can leverage this info for approvals or hardware provisioning, etc. 
 So how do you do keep track of the constant changes to job titles, employee relocations, etc. Is IT normally burdened with this? We are considering offloading this task to HR as this seems more within their realm of responsibility, but we are unsure what the best way to go about it is. Do you provide direct AD access to those non-IT users? Do you use third party software? Also, what permissions are used?

 I have a few Cisco switches on my network and want to add another one but I don't do it often so I want to make sure I don't mess it up since it's been a while. Some kind of an initial setup checklist such as this one would be helpful but it doesn't mention anything about VTP so I'm wondering if there is anything else I'm missing? The "new" switch was on another network before and I already wiped it (write erase) and deleted the VLAN database (delete flash:vlan.dat). Is there anything else to be done before configuring and then connecting to my network?

Just a North-South firewall?

 Large security enclaves / zones, for example a VRF sandwiched firewall?
 Anyone using Cisco ACI, just 'network centric', or going more to a 'application centric'/ more segmented approach?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on a project to upgrade some AV infrastructure which is running on Cisco SG500 (for video over IP) and Cisco SG300 (control, DANTE, general data etc). As these are discontinued, I am looking to move to the CBS350 range to keep things relatively consistent.
 In Australia, these are all basically non-existent for at least 52+ weeks. However, I have found the exact same models (albeit an NA model vs AU model) on US sites, in stock and available to ship.
 Apart from obvious conundrums around support should something go wrong or become faulty, is there any reason a USA version of a Cisco product would not work in Australia? All the switches I'm interested in have world PSU's, so that shouldn't be an issue.

 We were recently the target of a man in the middle attack that exploited a vulnerability in Microsoft's OTP feature for SharePoint.
 One of our users received an email from a breached account at another company with what looked like a link to a file. The link took the user to a page asking for their email address then after entering the email it took them to a page asking for a one time passcode. The passcode showed up in their email and they entered it. This allowed the attacker to bypass both their password and multifactor on their account.

 iam new hear. Yes, also as a IT Sys Admin Junior Possition. Ill get to the Point right away: We manually extend the Size of our Mailboxes (Exchange) from our users (around 1000) , everytime they send us a ticket and we extend it 20% . I wonder is there a chance to create a PS String Skript, which will check automaticly all users - lets say every week - check the mailboxes , and when the mailbox is at 80% of the size it will extend the mailboxsize 20% 
 maybe there is already a solution for this, but i cant find it.

 No current documentation is a available, people don't necessarily know where all of the network equipment is, there might be undocumented/rogue gear, and there might be orphaned VPN links to third parties that people have forgotten about. There is no current network engineer to ask, the last one died/retired/wandered off.
 Once I identify all active, reachable networks then I can sort and document them, create a list of points of contact and so on. Then for mystery networks start to dig, probe and eliminate.

 I have an question.
 We are starting a new application from a 3th party Supplier and need some basic information from you guys.
 Since all those new machines will be pushed with WDS+ workbench and joint in our AutoPilot section. There still some things WDS+ autopilot cannot do.
 And therefore my opinion is to use GPO's.
 We have 2 Domain controllers (second one is for backup) 1 Wsus server 1 file server (locally) + veaam backup enabled ** On the Fileserver WDS+workbench
 So that specific application needs to have an folder (user based, not Computer based) 
 So we created a folder with the content of the requested software in it. It is shared now. And now it needs to take that folder and copy it to the user profile of the machine.
 How to setup this 
 Is this possible? I think it is, but now knowing for sure. The 3th party group provided us the installation document. But the part for copy folder to user via wds+workbench is not in there, for them it is copy paste.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am trying to work out how we can have multiple tenants that are accessible by individual tenant administrator accounts. The documentation and web interface don't specify how a user logging in can specify the tenant they want to administer. I have Active Directory SSO working, so our tenant administrators get logged in automatically to the first tenant I created. However, if I create additional tenants and want certain users to have access to these in addition to our primary tenant, how do I grant access and have a way for the user to choose the tenant they login to? I see no way to grant permissions to the tenants to say which accounts have access, and if I try and use the same username on different tenants, it fails and says the user already exists.
 I think I may be fundamentally missing some crucial information on how this works.

 Hi,
 We have some places whereby we are alloted a single private IP inside of that company and we manage the networking infrastructure (IPS, switches, APs, etc.) under a double NAT situation, where our first gateway router is behind a NAT.
 Without an open port to the public facing internet, is there a way to still use TR-069 for our gateway device?
 -----------------------------------
 Essentially, this is what I want:
 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TR-069#Connection_request_over_NAT
 I've been researching how to use STUN for a few days now with no breakthrough, from my research it seems possible, and that I need to utiltise the same UDP port when traffic is coming back to the CPE equipment to do so. I'm open to exploring other open source ACS servers as well that has an easier implementation for NAT traversal via STUN or XMPP.
 Thank you.

 I am trying to use a PowerShell script for enabling and enforcing MFA for users in O365. The issue I'm having isn't with the script itself, it is when I try to automatically run the PowerShell. I get the authentication popup looking for credentials. I've found some articles that'll let you put your username and password into the script so you don't need to authenticate before running the script. The password is in plain text which I'm not good with. Is there a way to connect to O365 and run a PowerShell script without having to manually run it and authenticate? Also, my understanding on Microsoft Graph is limited at the moment, but I suspect there maybe a way to use Graph for this?

 If I try to report it using MIcrosoft's CERT abuse reporting website, I receive the same exactly worded automated email in response to the submission, and then always exactly one hour later they send another (automated) email saying that the issue has been resolved.

If I close the Microsoft login prompt it works for a while then disconnects and asks the Microsoft login again...
 The Exchange autodiscover is correct and only pointing to itself but if I use Outlook's Automatic configuration tester it immediately asks me for a Microsoft login, then if I close that it correctly asks for the domain credentials and once I provide that it gets the correct on-premises autodiscover information.
 The only detail I can think of is that we have a 365 tenant with some of the same email accounts as on-premises but it's only for Microsoft Teams, Exchange online is not configured anywhere at all, it's not even licenced.
 I've tried adding the autodiscover xml to the Outlook registry but it makes no difference, it's like it always phones home to Outlook before trying the actual email server domain.
 Has anyone had this issue before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy Friday Sysadmins! Do you have any plans this weekend? If not, I might have something you can sink your teeth into... Number Matching in MS Authenticator. 
 It's a feature which essentially rather than prompt a user for a "yes/no" "approve/deny" response on their phone, asks a user to enter a number into a prompt box. This effectively blocks an attacker from flooding their phone with MFA requests, fatiguing them into accepting, thinking it's something they've done wrong; because the user will never see the number and the attacker will instantly know that attack won't work.
 This feature went GA last week but some of you may have had it in preview for the last couple of months, it's pretty solid and I thoroughly recommend it. From a users perspective, it's no more effort than an old school SMS code, and a tiny bit more than hitting "approve"
 The only thing I dislike about it from a users perspective, is that I can no longer simply hit "approve" from my Apple watch.. so be mindful of that with your execs and managers, I guess..?
 My video talking about it, demoing it and showing you where the settings are in Azure AD can be found here:
 https://youtu.be/cjsViEclw1I
 Apologies for the croaky voice, I'm unwell but wanted to get my weekly video out there and keep up with helping the small community of followers I've been working with for the past couple of months.
 If anyone wants any help with this, hit me up!

I guess that I need a layer "between" Ceph and the OS/kernel? How can I basically do it, as each Ceph node has a different IP and I really don't want to add yet another layer of HaProxy or KeepAlived+Floating IP.
 What happens if two VMs want to write into the same file at the same time? Does Ceph have any kind of locking mechanism that prevents the file to be "double-write"?

 If you have a fibre run, and you connect two switches with 1Gbps transceivers, you get 1Gbps link. Yay.
 I'm trying to determine if "old" fibre is perfectly fine if it still works. You either get a 1Gbps connection or you don't - or - signal degradation and packet loss could mean a functional connection with a seriously low maximum capability even though the link is established at 1Gbps.
 What happens over time? 5 years, 10 years, 15 years? Does the capability of the medium degrade and lose performance? Do you get "indicated" 1Gbps right up until the point where you get no link? Do you get indicated 1Gbps but no where near the 1Gbps throughput and packet loss? 
 It's been quite hard to search for the answer, and I think I'm just using the wrong search terms, or this isn't widely discussed.

 it has been a long time since I last used group policies to administer servers or other computers. Right now we have a terminal server which everyone logs into and uses. I want to prevent certain users from turning off the server by applying the specific group policy rule. From my memory, I think I did the right steps but just now I tested it and it didnt work. I did the following steps:
  
Move Terminal Server to OU 'Servers'
 Link GPO to 'Servers' with User Configuration > Administrative Templates > Start Menu and Taskbar > Remove and Prevent Access to the shutdown command activated. 
 Link another GPO to 'Servers' with Computer Configuration\ Administrative Templates\ System\ Group Policy\Configure user Group Policy loopback processing mode activated.
 Set security group for both only allowing the Standard-User Group to apply the policy.
 gpupdate on terminal server
  
What I expect to happen is the machine reading the loopback policy on startup, however I'm not sure if I just prevented that using a security-group. Do I need to include the machine itself inside the security group? How is it different than using "authenticated users". 
 After reading the loopback policy, the Server tries to read the user config policy but ignores it, because it is not a user. Now when a user logs into the machine, although not being inside the OU, the user reads the user configuration from the policy because loopback is applied and applies the policy, when the user is a member of the security group. 
 I'm certain I made a mistake somewhere because otherwise it would work. 
 ​
 Thanks for any help

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have SQL 2019 STD RDS that is not domain joined and it's only accessible inside VPC (no public IP). I have an internal AD domain and several web servers joined to that internal AD inside VPC. MDTC is configured to with no auth on those EC2 instance and also on RDS. When I try distributed transaction initiated from the web app (on the EC2 instance) I get following error:
 "The MSDTC transaction manager was unable to pull the transaction from the source transaction manager due to communication problems. Possible causes are: a firewall is present and it doesn't have an exception for the MSDTC process, the two machines cannot find each other by their NetBIOS names, or the support for network transactions is not enabled for one of the two transaction managers. (Exception from HRESULT: 0x8004D02B)" 
 DNS resolution should be working on that RDS, I can't check since xp_cmd_shell can't be enabled to try it out so RDS should resolve EC2 instances, DNS servers are set on VPC DHCP settings. Security rules are currently to allow everything while I am troubleshooting. I did everything like I usually do without RDS
 RDS option group settings
 ENABLE_SNA_LU true ALLOW_OUTBOUND_CONNECTIONS true ALLOW_INBOUND_CONNECTIONS true ENABLE_XA true TRANSACTION_LOG_SIZE 4 AUTHENTICATION NONE 
 The only question left here is, do I need active directory joined RDS for this to work (and ofc all servers joined to that same AD)? From all the docs and videos available this should work, but didn't find info anywhere is being part of AD hard prereq or not.

 We are using Microsoft 365 E5 our data is still on the on-premise fileserver, we use Exchange Online for email.
 I've been asked to come up with a solution for the following "problem". 
 The company wants to do some compliance checks on outgoing email, but only on some pre-defined checks;
 - More than 10 external recipients in to, cc or bcc
 - More than 50 internal recipients in to, cc or bcc
 - Attachments with information such as addresses or financial data to external recipients. 
 With the 'checks' above, there need to be some actions configured;
 - Block message (quarantaine) with message "Are you sure you want to sent this message" if 'yes' then send.
 - Block message (quarantaine) with message "Message blocked due to high amount of external recipients".
 - Block message (sent to manager for approval)
 - Block message with message "Contact IT for additional support" 
 I've been digging around and could not come up with a solution for this.
 Only things i could find where;
 - Limit the total recicpients per message
 - Limit the total recipients you can mail to per hour/day
 - Sent all external mail for approval to a manager 
 Does anyone knows a possible solution for this within the Microsoft e5 suite? 
 Thanks!

 If it is true that I can do that, why would I? Doesn't it make more sense to just use AD directly?

 I work for a company that services public safety radio systems, dispatch consoles, and the networks they are linked through. The company I work for requires us to be on an on-call rotation, 24x7 every 2 weeks (this figure depends on the number of competent techs). 
 We get paid a fixed standby amount for the week on-call of $100, with automatic time and a half when responding after hours. For municipalities on maintenance agreements, our time starts from port to port (company provided car). Phone walkthroughs are not paid. For customers not on a maintenance agreement, it’s a minimum 4 hours paid, but this is rare.
 The industry I’m in is small, and there isn’t much of a baseline for typical on-call standby compensation and minimum hour paid, so I’m turning to you guys to get an idea for an average in a somewhat related field. 
 Forgive me if this is not allowed, there isn’t much of a community of RF techs online. Please remove if not within the scope of the community.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For work I'm deploying raspberry pi's connecting through gateway devices with SIM cards having static IPs. We've kept default settings mostly, no firewall but no ports being forwarded, except 22 for ssh which goes to a DMZ and then to the pi. 443 and 80 take you to the gateway login screen.
 First question: Does having no firewall matter if we're not forwarding any ports? Surely traffic just dies in a slightly different way?
 And much more importantly:
 Am I going to get DDoS'ed on port 22 any day now? /var/log/auth.log shows failed connection attempts every few minutes. The root account has a complex password with timeouts per attempt, so I'm not worried about access, but is it only a matter of time before some more ambitious bot discovers an open ssh port serving password attempts and has a thousand computers a common password dictionary on me? Or some Russian hackers take me down just so they can pretend I'm a drone bill the KGB?
 If yes, is the way to be safe to close down all ports and use openvpn to gain access? (This sucks because we'd like to access our gateway if the pi goes down). Or could I geo-lock access and save myself? 
 But at the end of the day, even if the gateway is set to deny all requests except ones from my own ip address, couldn't someone DDoS the firewall? Is a static IP safe for small businesses without cloudflare or whatever?

 I was thinking about a F5 Big IP, but these are really expensive and seemingly unobtainium at this point, I tried emailing them and a couple of their resellers and heard nothing back. I also have a hard time justifying $15,000 for a load balancer before the HTTP side just to demo.
 I think I could justify a pair of NASs, but there's a lot of moving parts and I have never seen files copied/downloaded at this speed. 
 Any ideas?

 Just wondering if anyone has had any luck finding an easy solution to converting raw syslog messages from their network devices into CEF format so they can be ingested into Microsoft Sentinel properly?
 This seems like something a small docker container with syslog-ng or rsyslog should be able to handle, syslog in, cef out.
 I'm having no luck finding anything though so thought I would ask here before I spend the time trying to build it myself.
 Anyone come up with a good solution?

 An accounting and tax software, whose engineering teams states they have national clients when asked how large some of the companies are that use their software, informed me that their software does not have any method for mass deployment.
 They do not offer any method of command line to install it. The exe (which i used USSF from that post a few days ago) does not have any hidden flags. It appears that it is simply an exe that when launched, extracts the files.
 So I am off to figure out where it puts its extracted files and go from there on how to install this.
 I don't normally rant, but when they told me they don't have any method of mass deployment and to use a tool like SCCM, I was astounded. We use other tools, but they don't support installers that offer no command line install options...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[This was just a weird situation all around, and I just needed to rant about it for a bit. This happened about 2 weeks ago.
 In the middle of the IT department, there is a table with our primary printer. One day, randomly, there were cupcakes and a bag with a brand name on it (the bag also contained 2 handwritten cards directed to our director and CIO). I asked around, no one knew where they came from. My coworkers started eating the cupcakes, but I didn't because I had a bad feeling about them. You need a key fob to get into our building, we had never heard of the brand before, and no one saw the person who dropped them off.
 Fast forward a couple of hours. I'm in the restroom and so is the building's receptionist. "How did you guys like your cupcakes?" she asked. I looked at her, confused, and asked what she knew about them.
 "Well, a guy came in and said they were for the IT department. I couldn't get ahold of anyone, so I just sent him back." Awkwardly, I told her none of us saw him and none of us knew who he was, either.
 "Oh."
 Getting back to my desk, I tell my coworkers what I had learned. Some random vendor we've never dealt with before personally delivered cupcakes. Whatever, vendor wants you to buy their products. What upset me more is that our receptionist just let a random person into the building for really no reason. We're not government or anything like that, but why have key fobs for the doors if our receptionist is going to let just about anyone in?
 Apparently I was the only one freaked out by that - everyone else had a cupcake. Luckily, they were just regular cupcakes, but still. That did NOT sit well with me.
 Rant over.

 My company recently started a new project. The idea is that one entire building(500+ users) with different companies logs into one SSID. Every company will have his own vlan through a radius server. Printers should be available to all vlans. We used avahi(mDNS reflector) to make printers available in all vlan’s. But for obvious reasons we don’t want printers to broadcast itself. Since some printers shouldn’t be used by other companies.
 We tried:
 We tried blocking outgoing mDNS broadcast packages. But that didn’t help.
 We looked into avahi option’s. It doesn’t look like they cant regulate traffic like we want.
 Same for aruba switch, it supports mDNS reflection. But cant actually regulate traffic like i want?
 Question:
 Is there a different way to make this happen? Or is there an good way to regulate these mDNS packages?
 Thanks,
 Luc
 Edit:
 So in the building we got flex spots. So sometimes different companies will use different places in the building. Thats why its import most of the printers should still be available.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Guys...So I have a 15u server cabinet that I'm thinking of mounting on an already installed plywood in a closet. The issue is that the space on it is taken up by other things such as pre-installed telco equipment and cables. My question is has anyone mounted some 2x4's on the plywood to mount the cabinet to in order to clear said cable bundle? I also have another section where I can mount the cabinet to on concrete block at a height that is reachable. The issue is that it will be very tight in that section and also very close to a power panel. If it doesn't work out, I've managed to source some caster wheels for said cabinet to keep on floor level, but it would be a lot cleaner looking on the wall and out of the way. Any advice or suggestions are appreciated. Thanks in advance.

 I think this would be a helpful tool, and if it was under $500 I would just buy one. However, I wanted to hear from others before dropping multiple thousands of dollars on such a tool. 
 Does anyone here own an Ekahau or similar device? Do you use it often? Has it been worth the cost in your opinion?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Networkers!
 Need some advice and insight. How have you all managed routing in a mixed vendor environment? My question is specifically with Juniper vs Cisco: route preference vs administrative distance?
 Still working on the details, but as of now we have branch office router seeing two default routes one in IGP OSPF and another in BGP. One of the default routes is for internet access and the other from corporate (Incase the internet default goes down).
 The branch router runs IOS-XE, Corp device is Juniper, and the internet default comes from a Palo-Alto FW.
 Our Juniper rep has said to change Cisco’s AD values to match theirs and guess what our Cisco rep said the same thing for Juniper! I get the feeling they are just looking to gain an advantage over the other and not really engineering anything. So I have come here looking for suggestions and insight.
 Edit:spelling and details

I'm sick of having sales tell me one thing and then when it comes to implementation I get a totally different story. Working in the financial services sector it's all vendors do anymore, they lie and they lie and they lie. I want to build systems and solutions not have legal battles with a bunch of liars. I'm to the point that I'm going to start recording sales calls because I don't know what else to do. People are going to say, "make sure it's in the contract", and I do to the best of my ability when its a vendor I picked, but I'm also not a lawyer, I'm a sysadmin. Not to mention jumping ship from vendor to vendor can be more disruptive than just dealing with it or figuring out a manual solution for things. This job isn't fun anymore and frankly it sucks. OK, I've said what I wanted to say, thanks for listening. If you want to call out any liars in the comments feel free.

 But I also wonder how much the environment is affecting performance. A few things I’m thinking about - interference from welding machines, microscopic pieces of steel in the air causing signal issues, giant pieces of steel everywhere reflecting Wi-Fi signal, steel dusting settling on the APs making a faraday cage kind of thing.
 Anyone have advice for this kind of environment? Am I being overly cautious? Anything else to consider?

 Packets sent = 117, Received = 60, Lost = 57 (48% loss). This loss percentage varies between 45-80%.
 Approx round trip time in ms = 
 average = 4-14ms, max = 767ms 
 These Cat6s are running from devices in field to a control station. There is some electric interference present around them (120V) but these are 600V rated Cat6 cables. Since they are 600V rated, they are very bulky. Customer suggested us that the weight of the cables could be causing the issue at the switch. I find that difficult to believe since only 4 out of 60 Cat6s are acting up.
 I am thinking as a first step of troubleshooting to re-terminate both ends for the cables. Sounds like an easy thing to do but not so easy when a lot of other parties are involved.
 What could be the most likely cause for this? Any suggestions?
 Appreciate the help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy everyone!
 Hoping someone can clear this up for me. I've got a vulnerability warning in the Defender portal showing that 27 of my devices have OpenSSL installed and need to be updated. The part that's confusing me here is that I can find no trace of OpenSSL installed on these systems. The only place that it shows as installed is in the Defender portal. There's no trace of it in the Windows Registry, nothing in the system path, no services running, nothing in the installed apps list, etc. But Defender is going as far as pulling in different version numbers from somewhere. 
 Any ideas on what's happening here? This is only showing on about half of my devices. All have been deployed through Intune. We don't do any sort of custom certificate management and I've sure never set up OpenSSL to be deployed, so I'm not sure where it's coming from as it isn't very consistent. Some of these devices were deployed months ago, one was freshly ran through autopilot earlier this week. 
 Much thanks to anyone who can point me in the right direction here.

When I stop the firewall on the remote computer and run the add-computer command again, it works, so it seems windows firewall is blocking something.
 Does anyone know what specifically I need to enable/allow on the firewall to allow this remote management?
 The reason I ask is that I am automating the entire VM build process, so manually RDPing to the machine after it is created to stop firewall, then re-running the join domain command is not the solution I am looking for. I need to know what on the firewall I need to open so that I can automate it.

 I've asked the school to provide IP address of his logins during the day but they only provided/obtained the schools external IP address. They did not provide any internal IP address, obviously the internal IP address with login data is the most valuable for us.
 Can anyone think of a why where we can be sure this data is retained while we work with a lawyer? I've made the request with the school now on two different occasions. Can anyone think of other information that I might not be thinking about?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 I had a quick question regarding my new jobs network setup. Bare with me, as this is the first time I have ever worked with Cisco Devices, so my knowledge of them is fairly slim.
 Here is the situation broken down very simply:
 - We have 2 ISP Connections (Primary and Backup)
 - We have 1 CORE Cisco Switch (Cisco 6807XL)
 - We have 2 CheckPoint Firewalls setup in "High Availability Mode"
 Now here is where I THINK I understand the setup, but in reality I need clarification or for someone to tell me that I have it worked out in my head correctly lol.
 I have roughed up a very rudimentary drawing of how it is setup -- Here is the link: https://ibb.co/zhBwnK1
 All I am curious about is:
 1.) For the ISP Connections... They are going into Ports that are tagged as VLAN 17 & 18 .... And the Firewalls are connected to more ports that are also tagged as VLAN 17 & 18 ----- Does this mean that the Internet is "piping into that first port" and then any other ports that are tagged as 17 / 18 ... are automatically getting blanketed with that ISP connection (Just like how an unmanaged switch works)? And Thus.... in the Eyes of the Firewalls, the Firewall's WAN Port just thinks that you took the Ethernet cable from the back of each Modem... and plugged it straight into the Firewall?
 In all my years of experience with networking, I have only ever seen the chain look like this:
 ISP Modem >>> Firewall >>> Core Switch >>> Smaller Switches >>> PC's / Printers / AP's / Etc
 So the fact that this job is setup backwards (in my eyes) as:
 ISP Modem(s) >>> Core Switch >>> Firewall >>> Smaller switches >>> PC's / Printers / AP's / Etc ---- And the fact that I am a Cisco novice lol... Its the perfect storm for confusion.
 I hope this makes sense, and if anyone has any thoughts - I would greatly appreciate them!
 Thanks,

 18.04 LTS will soon enter "Extended Security Maintenance (ESM)".
 What does this mean compared to the normal "Hardware and maintenance updates" phase?
 Security-wise and only considering the OS, is 18.04 then as secure as 22.04 LTS? Meaning they get the same security updates as long as they are supported?
 My understanding is that 22.04 LTS comes with newer versions of all packages compared to 18.04 LTS. Doesn't this mean that 22.04 LTS is better security-wise than 18.04 LTS?
 What I am basically aiming at is whether upgrading 18.04 LTS to 22.04 LTS is worth the risk compared to the benefits (benefits being mostly higher security due to fixed vulnerabilities?)

 I'm not a Linux specialist and I have a linux-server with apache 2.4.38 in my environment. Now the question is, how do I identify which version of Apache is vulnerable? I didn't find anything on apache.org about the library which should be included in this version.
 I read, that there should be a library with the name " Apache Commons Text versions 1.5 through 1.9. ", which is vulnerable. But how do I find this library on the system? Is this even possible?
 ​
 thank you for any support.
 ​
 edit: I found the library ( Commons Text – Download Apache Commons Text ). Can I just install it on the Linux machine? or should I update the whole apache? How can I identify that it isn't vulnerable anymore?

 How broken is the system in place where there is that level of inefficiency. 
 Then an NHS IT worker came round and said to them at reception that they need to take the system down to replace a broken cable over the weekend so they were going round and putting wireless dongles into the computers….
 He was then asked about sending email, one person said that I would have a few different windows open at a time so you can queue your email as emails took about 5 minutes to arrive....sigh

 Can you help me ? I’ve tried to find the information online but I’m not being successful. Huawei's site was asking for a sign-in just to download the documentation. And even after registering a free account, it still doesn’t allow me to download it because it seems this equipment is considered corporate. It’s quite frustrating.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 We were recently discussing the Microsoft Authenticator app in a meeting. Someone mentioned they store all their passwords in it rather than in Chrome / Edge. One of us - fairly senior member of the team- became concerned about this and basically said:
 "Well the whole point of MFA is you have a known password, and then a thing, and that thing is either a hardware token, or the MFA app - However if the app now stores passwords, doesn't that defeat the purpose of MFA?"
 From my point of view, it would be way too much of a faux pas if Microsoft just hadn't thought of this, and with our phones being in Intune, they have to have a password, they likely have biometrics etc, so i cant see it being an issue?
 Also i just tried signing in with my work account to the password keeper part, and it wouldnt accept the details, as it needs to be a Microsoft account, not a Work or school account.
 Does anyone else have any views on this that would help me articulate clearly to my colleague why this wouldnt be a security issue? Thanks

CISO refuses to whitelist that URL because we don't want to have access to every single s3 bucket out there. Here's where I'm stuck: As far as I can tell in firewall logs and pcaps, the app isn't even trying to reach a particular region or bucket: it's just trying to hit the broad s3.amazonaws.com domain. If that's true, then how do I restrict this application's access? 
 I know precious little about how AWS works on the back end, so feel free to ELI5. I feel like there's some kind of fundamental misunderstanding I have that would solve everything, if only I knew what that was.

 It's kind of a never ending topic, but I'd like to discuss it with you :
  
As a starting point, which firewall logs would you forward to your SIEM ?
 How do you improve your strategy over time ?
  
Do you go by log severity ? By policy ? What would be your different opinions ?
 I've been talking with many sysadmin and no one of them was doing it the same way. So I'd like to here your take on this subject !
 Thank y'all !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello
 I manage a server for an important site which is regularly the target for DDoS attacks etc. The site is occasionally sending out newsletters to subscribers. That server is hosted on Hetzner. Hetzner has been contacting me with abuse requests (AbusePhishing: SPAM/PHISH Complaint) that people have sent them and is now threatening to shut down the server. I had a look at those forwarded emails and I discovered that the Message-ID hashes cannot be found in my /var/log/mail* logs (I have enough logs to cover the timestamps that those emails have allegedly been sent from my server). The emails content contains the newsletter content from the site but also appends various Pfizer spam links and images. All other legit emails that the site has sent can very easily be found via grepping their Message-IDs in /var/log/mail*.
 Question: Is there a possibility that a malicious actor has subscribed to the site's newsletter, copy/pasted the email that was sent to them, polluted it with spam links, and reported this as an abuse to their provider, in hope that it'll reach Hetzner which will in turn threaten with shutting down the server? Does this thing ("fake spam abuse claims") actually exist? Have you heard about it before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 ​
 Im curious about how a site-to-site IPsec VPN tunnel works where one end have a public IP and the other end have a private IP.
 ​
 For example, let say on site A: we have a firewall that is connected to a router. The WAN interface on the firewall is a private IP, 192.168.1.1/30 and is connected to a port on the router, and the routers WAN port pointing to the ISP, have a public IP.
 ​
 So,
  
How can we establish a VPN tunnel between the sites and how would the configuration look like? I know for example that on site A, the router needs to forward port 500 & 4500 for IPsec communication. But from site B, what would the peering IP be since private IPs are not routable on the internet?
 And how would the configuration would look like on site A when configuring a peering IP? I think that you need to NAT on site A but my brain just wont let me understand how this would exactly work out when I tried to lab it.
  
​
 Appreciate your help.
 ​
 EDIT: I want to understand how to establish a VPN tunnel between the firewalls, so from site A firewall that have a private IP to the firewall on site B that have a public IP, sorry for not clarifying it.

 However, if you work in Education or my case Higher Ed you know things are... different? 
 At the moment our staff and faculty have always used Exchange while students have always used Gmail. 
 Well, now we are going to move students over to Microsoft 365 along with exchange online.
 My question is, does your institute use different tenants? One for students and one for Staff? Or do you put them all under the same tenant and if so do you use different domains for each?
 I'm leaning toward having 2 tenants. 
 What have your experiences been?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi fellow Redditors
 Due to also some recent ransomware that had attacked also my company's competitor, some people, that in my and a colleague of mine opinion are trying to justify their pay, have had this "novel" idea to change the wallpaper of computers every week or so, with a message dedicated to educating ransomware/phishing techniques and avoiding them.
 There seems to be a good intention, for this, and I definitely agree, however, what i don't agree with, is the way this is intended to educate the end user. 
 You see, the very end user audience that this is intended for has no time to pay too much attention to the text that is on the wallpaper. They are on the clock the soon they enter the premises, and they have to be ready to start working asap. 
 As a company, we have our internal courses for training purposes, and this includes almost every subject that touches the company, and some of those courses are mandatory, even for IT staff like me.
 However, having this type of messaging via wallpaper, seems overboard to me, and having to file requests to go before CAB, any GPO changes go to CAB no matter what the purpose is, for this is ludicrous.
 Time is better spent to educate the users with proper courses, not via a small text on the wallpaper, with horrible colours.
 ​
 So, my fellow professional Redditors, how would you approach this if it comes into your lap? What better solution would you recommend, and what is your general opinion of delivering messages via desktop wallpapers every other week or more?

 My company went from around 150 employees to 600 in two years.
 User management is beginning to take its toll on our relatively small IT department.
 We currently have a Microsoft Form that HR submits with the User On- or Offboarding info. Name, e-mail, Department, Manager, Title, Accesses, Licenses etc. We then get this form sent to our helpdesk where we later create the user on-prem which later syncs to Azure.
 There is always something missing, wrong manager, new distribution group needed, additional access/licenses, wrong PC ordered, new start/end date, change of PIM etc,. It takes so much time from us.
 Is there a better way to handle these requests? Any third-party solutions?
 How do larger enterprises solve this? I can't fathom them having guys only working full-time with user management (on this level).
 How do YOU do it in your company?
 Cheers!

 Using tools / formats that are readily available on most machines (like zip) is helpful but not a must.
 For compression, it seems zstd is pretty sweet. I've never used it tho. Opinions or alternatives are very welcome.
 For encryption, I usually use GPG, but I'm concerned about performance. I'm open to both symmetric and asymmetric solutions.

 The hosts need to talk to each other, and each stack is the layer 3 gateway for its respective host.
 How would you expand this to avoid the switch stack as a single point of failure, without the benefit of purchasing any new equipment other than more 3850 stacks.
 Splitting the stacks and connecting the 4 switches together is an option, but now we have a spanning tree loop (that's blocked, but still)
 Is there a better way?
 Quick edit, obviously there ARE better ways, with equipment that would support VSS, vPC, MLAG, etc. But in this case, let's pretend we only have access to 3850s.

 The organization I work for is merging one AD domain into a larger domain. I've combed this sub and some forums so I'm going to answer the question I think I'm going to get fist: yes we have contracted with a company that has software that does this very thing.
 Here's the issue. For as good as this company used to be, it's gone downhill in recent years. The support (or lack of) we're getting is making us think they have no idea how the tool works. We're a small outfit so it's possible they've given us less experienced techs, but we're still talking about moving 800 endpoints and a lot of files. I'm getting nervous about using the tool to re-permission files when they don't seem to have a grasp on what the tool is doing. I want a backup plan.
 The sAMAccountName is the same in both source and target domain. File servers are located in and permissioned to the target domain.
 Here's my question: does anyone have a suggestion for a tool or script that can view the permissions for files in the source domain and add the matching target domain user?
 I'm more of a bash guy, but I can learn enough PowerShell to get this job done if necessary. I do have a full set of backups should the worst happen.
 Thank you!

 I am positive I am doing something someone else has done and my google-fu is failing me. I am not a VMware guy, but our on-prem data center is 100% VMware. Today I use packer to build and distribute our new monthly windows images to our azure regions. Word made it to the powers that be that my image is better documented (infra as code essentially) and more consistent than what our on-prem server team is doing. So naturally they decided that I should just "provide the image" to the infra team to use on the vcenters. Problem is I am way out of my element here. I have a repeatable process to get the azure images down as an VHD to the hybrid runbook worker. The problem I haven't figured out is how to get them into a format the VMware guys can use. 
 So with the long context out of the way, anyone got any good step by step guides or YouTube video they can recommend to get azure images into vSphere as a template? Or a tool that easily converts VHD files into a VMware vSphere friendly template format?

 It looks like there aren’t a whole lot of differences in the Gen 3 other than the 12th Gen i5 but it’s like $1000 more. Is it REALLY worth the spend to go into a newer generation of processor? I’m open to extra spend if it’s justified, but I’m drawing a blank other than it’s slightly better performance. 
 These laptops will be for standard users who mainly just run office apps and PDFs so not power users or anything. 
 Thanks!

 Network admin with 5~ years under my belt, previously sys admin for a year before that, and help desk for 10 that did a lot of the networking stuff because I was interested in it. 
 I've recently got a new job, that's in an EXTREMELY fast paced environment. I've never used a Palo Alto before, but I have used Cisco FTD, Meraki, Watchguard, and SonicWall. I've set up IPSec tunnels, static routes, VLANs, etc. Everything you'd expect a mid-tier network admin to be able to do. However I'm now starting off in my Palo Alto project to migrate from our SonicWall and I am STRUGGLING.
 There are certain things in the interface I can do just by looking at it. DHCP, static routes, interface creation, etc etc. But I am struggling really hard in a lot of other places. I'm know it's me, but the …]]></summary>

Mid-sized company, 350-ish employees and the finance team absolutely insists that I put everything on our damn company credit cards rather than cutting a check or ACH. Critical services like telecom, the AWS bill, other cloud services, literally everything.
 They also won't let me use terms billing with vendors like Amazon, because you have to pay those invoices with a check, so I get to reconcile dozens of receipts separately every month.
 I've tried arguing against it, citing the PITA that ensues every time there's suspected or actual fraud on the card and I have to get a new one, or when we've gone over the company limit and my card is just dead for 2-3 days. But oh no, "this is what management prefers."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[After months of complaints, I think my company is finally going to bite the bullet and get a new VPN after realizing Meraki's VPN was not designed for WFH. I've been fiddling with a bunch of products and would love to hear any real world feedback on what folks are switching to for VPN. I have a small office network but most stuff in AWS. 
 So far, I've been recommended:
 - Twingate: most often recommended in my circle and I use it for my homelab. Super easy to use and nice integrations. Curious to learn from anyone who's ran this in production at their company.
 - Cloudflare: eng team uses their CDN so easy to tack-on for their VPN product. Finding it pretty gnarly to set up and maintain and generally seems like a half-baked product. Anyone using this?
 - Zscaler: friends who work at bigcos use this, but honestly seems a little overkill. Sales process to even get a trial to POC was a pain, but seems very full featured. 
 - Tailscale: lots of people use it for homelab, but haven't found anyone who uses it for their company. Generally doesn't seem serious for businesses (most of those same people pointed me to Twingate to compare). Any one using it for their company?
 Have looked at a bunch of others as well, but shortlisting the above. Looking for some real world feedback.

 "Support" teams are clueless. Customer service is completely absent. 
 The first response is often a generic request for information that was provided in a ticket.
 Reactions to basic questions like "You've collected logs, how and when should I expect to receive an update?" make it seem as though I'm speaking a different language.
 Tickets go into black holes, and I have to call and speak to a supervisor to get something as basic as a status update.
 Seriously - speaking as someone that manages a support team, the people managing these teams should be embarassed to go to work.
 Am I alone here or have things seriously gone to shit?

 I’m currently a senior telephony engineer, my career began in 2015 (I self studied CCNA and whilst studying, took the leap and applied for junior network engineer job and landed one, I did not go university so I have no degree) I stayed at my first job for about 1 year and then moved onto another network role as the colleague I worked with was awful and I wasn’t learning much from him, just experiencing his anger issues at everyone and anyone each day. 
 Second job rolls around and it’s going great until they push me into telephony, aren’t paying me enough but are making me juggle both network and telephony and then one day decide I have to cut out networking and focus on telephony, I then get a call for another telephony job and I go for it as it’s paying more, I get it so I move on.. I stayed there for about 10 months and then I got a call for my current job and I’ve been here for nearly 3 years. 
 Now.. my current workplace are getting rid of all Cisco telephony and moving onto MS teams, no issue there but I’m not feeling any personal development for myself and I’m not sure if I should get my CCNA and go back into networking (also worried about a salary cut as i’m now a mum and I also support my mum financially as my dad left when I was very young) or do I delve into the cyber space as I always had an interest for it.
 My husband is suggesting I try programming as he’s in the field and he thinks, with my background I won’t have a problem landing a job if I can learn and understand it.

But my question is, is there a way to create a default route in azure to send all internet destined traffic to my palo alto vm that is internet facing? Furthermore, is there a way to advertise that same default route and advertise it to a downstream spoke via eBGP, in this case OCI assuming that the eBGP peering is already in place between the two clouds. Would I perhaps need an azure route server , and pass this default route from my palo vm via ebgp, so that azure/oci internet traffic all goes out of the internet interface of the palo vms?

 Example, the main device on my network will loose connection with another device but it I plug directly into the switch on that device I can see/connect with the device that is not seeing the other device.
 Also if I plug my laptop directly into the cat cable on the device that can’t see the other devices I can see/connect to that device. A reboot of the device that is having issues fixes the problem. 
 I should also add that there is no firewall enabled and it’s super intermittent and it’s not always the same device when it happens but every time the only fix I’ve found is to reboot.

 i don't know if this question is allowed (Rule #6), but i don't get the necessary pieces together.
 I found the following article / documentation for Proxmox which mentioned the use of OVS for SDN deployments.
 Now to my question: How can i route traffic from a specific VXLAN (VM inside of a VXLAN) to the "outer world" such as physical servers or other networks? Or even intra VNI traffic? The best case scenario would be that a firewall could handle all these cases. 
 To be clear i don't expect a full-answer to this question. A hint would be sufficient which guides me to the pieces or knowledge i am currently missing.
 Thanks in advance of all people who are wiser and kinder then me ^^

 Some clients are physically connected to both (copper / fiber). Machines with 10G cards connect to the 172 network to connect to file servers, and use the 192 to get to the internet. 
 Would connecting these two networks to each other, via a fiber cable from the 192 switch to the 172 switch, cause a loop? Or should I pull the copper from each workstation first? I want to phase out the 172 network, and have the 192 network access 1G and 10G infrastructure.

 Part of my Job duties include making sure these assets are connected to our wifi network and available to remote into, usually between 200-300 at a time. Recently I've noticed that our AP's have been dropping assets more than usual and I would like to monitor the devices proactively vs waiting for a tech to inform me that one has lost connection and they are unable to remote into it. 
 I keep an excel sheet with all the assets listed by Serial number and location and I'm looking for some sort of solution to monitor this list and make sure all assets on the list are pingable and showing connected. I am a contractor and have ZERO access to the access points or wifi network so I obtain IPs by pinging the serial number. 
 This may not be the best place to ask this but I figured it's simple enough that people in this group would understand my question and probably know of a simple solution. 
 Also I have a very small amount of technical experience, mostly all self taught for this position and solving my own problems at home. I know some basics, but way less than most of you probably lol.

We currently have it disabled across the board via GPO but I am in the process of enabling the firewall internally. I'm just not sure if I want to enable it on servers. Seems like a disaster to have to whitelist every port that's being used.
 UPDATE: Thanks everyone. I obviously knew what the answer was going to be but wanted to bring this to management to prove that this is an issue. This network was inherited and the org definitely has a lot of "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" mentality.

Due to some provider limitations, we're looking at using two firewalls for egress from a specific location and want to make sure that client/server conversations stick to a single firewall. Current plan is to use static routing with IP SLA health checks and set each egress at the same weight. What I can't figure out is what load balance mechanism for static routes is used on IOS XE on a Cat9400 or Cat4500. Is it just src/dst IP or is there more to it than that? Labbed in Eve-NG with IOSv and it appeared to be src/dst IP but I don't know how to confirm that hardware will function the same way.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Howdy! 
 We have multiple servers that ~70 staff use daily that I would like to migrate to drive.google.com given the age of the equipment and the recent string of hard drive failures ... but after asking everyone to pair down to the current data versus legacy we still have many department folders that are over the 400,000 items/object limit 
 Since a shared drive can contain a maximum of 400,000 items/objects ( including files, folders, and shortcuts) I'm not sure what to do ... also given the large quantity I'm concerned about how well the Google Drive for Desktop application will work (everyone uses macOS and some computers are 5 years old)
 Through discussion, staff have agreed they can split out the files they don't need constant access to e.g. an "active archive file server website" and could access via a different site/service or similar but I'm not sure what would be a good service to support split access and doesn't cost a fortune. Looked at Backblaze B2 but its not really built for that. Google cloud storage supports the idea of it but is expensive and still isn't really designed to be easily browsed like a filesystem. Certainly Dropbox or similar services could work well ... but we're duplicating systems and costs then which seems silly. Management suggested just start new on drive.google.com and keep running the legacy servers but that doesn't fix the issue of the old, failing equipment.
 In a perfect world there would be select folders that you would stream to Google Drive for Desktop and then others would only be available at drive.google.com but that doesn't seem possible like it once was in older versions? Thought about setting up a separate Google active-archive user that staff could login to but with 70 people and changing staff that seems cumbersome at best. 
 Any suggestions?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 Backupify was driving me nuts,
 I just switched to AFS last night, they backed up my 100GB mailbox in 5:06 minutes, insane speed.
 They gave me option to choose datacenter which I could not find with other solutions, this made compliance easy for one of our domains has to be in Canada due to healthcare rules.
 The interface is clunky, but the speed and cost are amazing,
 I wanted to go back to spinbackup due to the search/discovery and security features for multi-domain environments (I find it cheaper then enhancing and building policies in multi-domains), but their prices seemed to have doubled in the pandemic and the multi-domain is complicated.
 AFS seems to hit the multi-domain part well, I got various licenses at multiple entities so getting a solution where everything is under one hood is nice. I have some domains with Gsuite+M365 and others that are just Gsuite and some just M365.
 Anyways the setup and configuration took me about 25 minutes, I set it all up myself and have all my sites / teams / mailboxes etc... all backed up now and I am saving a few hundred bucks a month which I will use now to setup some other compliance tools.
 I am still searching for a solution that has a faster and easier interface to run searches across multi-domains / platforms (Gsuite/M365), right now I use an expensive tool and its a pain in the bum for the queries, if anyone knows of a moderately priced solution like AFS I am interested. I have to run searches for PDF's and the content within PDF's regularly, which is why I sync things to google drive as they have ability to search PDF's.

Not that much experience in networking working day to day as you guys do and furthermore I work 4 shifts day, night rest off (good for work-life balance). Our ICT department just split in half NOC and SOC, and head of NOC is vacant. I have always been keen and worked very hard. The vacancy requirements, I full fill them all but I have to start to work 5 days a week from work and, later on, I can work remotely. My biggest concern is my lack of experience, not in a managerial position but in knowing all the systems that they work on. What are your suggestions shall I apply knowing I lack experience and then if I will be chosen I learn along the way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The firm I work for has a small residential site in a rural area in the UK (South/West Wales). From the looks of it there's no chance of anything other than 3mbit ADSL via the phone line or less than ideal 4G using an external antenna. There's no altnets in the area and leased lines are looking at £800/month which isn't really feasible.
 However, as this site will need to provide public and staff internet connectivity we will need decent bandwidth (say up to 80mbit download), so we're looking to use starlink to provide this.
 I was wondering if anyone here has used Starlink for this kind of fixed site job and had any information regarding reliability and ease of configuration? My main worry is being able to use my own router/firewall if the supplied unit doesn't have the features we need. Also does anyone know if the "domestic" tier has any acceptable use limits?

 I'm using a nightly of VyOS and have an extremely simple single interface config for validation. I am able to use tcpdump and see tagged traffic coming in on the parent interface.
 But I am unable to get traffic out the NIC tagged. Is this a limitation of SR-IOV in Hyper-V? I have been down so many rabbit holes with VF security and MAC spoofing and filtering and nearly all information is targeting KVM not Hyper-V.
 Has anyone been able to get guest VLAN tagging through SR-IOV?

I've just set an ip for the device as 192.168.0.2 and gateway the same exactly and I don't see it within the network anymore. I have no mac address for it and can't find it with any scan tool or anything. I can't hardware reset it in any way and I had access only via network. It also has an open telnet port 23 that I don't know how to use and if I can access it.
 Any help will be really appreciated. 🙏

 I am not worried about making use of company devices for personal purposes, as this is easily covered by a policy. 
 I am thinking of tools like network sniffers or vulnerability scanners that are normally acceptable on system administrators' devices, but may occasionally be required by someone else to troubleshoot specific code projects etc...

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Good Morning,
 Hopefully someone can help as I've run out of ideas.
 I have an old tenant and a new tenant. Both are using Microsoft Purview Encryption's 'Encrypt-only' option within the Outlook desktop client.
 If old tenant sends an email to newer tenant, the new tenant can read the email natively within the Outlook desktop app.
 If the new tenant sends an email to the older tenant, the old tenant has to go to Outlook on the web to access.
 Bits you might want to know.
  
Both using Exchange Online
 Both are using Microsoft Outlook for Microsoft 365 MSO (version 2208 on new tenant, version 2209 on old tenant).
 I've tried doing this manually via the Outlook client and via DLP, but same experience.
  
If someone has an answer or guidance, I'd really appreciate it.
 Thanks,
 Max

A few thousand names and email addresses of Dropbox employees, current and past customers, sales leads, and vendors were exposed. 
  
On October 14, the account got breached by the attackers through a phishing campaign impersonating CircleCI.

 I was givin the task to implement S/MIME. Yet, never done that before.
 I know that after some research, that every E-Mail Adress needs to be signed for encryption.
 We have roughly 150 Clients which just need to communicate to a single entity (some gov. agency). Altough the plans are to expand that in the future.
 Now I'm not sure what to do, we do not have a S/MIME Gateway (yet) and all we have atm. is an Exchange OnPrem (2013 , Update soon) and Outlook 2013/2016 on our Clients.
 I'm not sure where to start and where to go from here.
 > Purchasing S/MIME Certs and distribute them on all of the Clients
 > Letting a internal CA create User-Certs and use them to sign and just send the other entity the root CA.

 I am a bit over my head here and every guidance is more than welcome :)

 Do this mean the http GET request does not actually connect to the .com TLD but rather the malicious .xyz? I’m a bit confused on what the referer field is implying.

 How big of a deal is it to fluff your resume? I don't mean outright lie, but add a bit more than is technically truthful?
 Additionally, how often to you look at college vs no college? 
 I'm really pointing my career to Systems Engineering, rather than systems administration, so I was wondering if College is a big decider there.

 Does anyone know how I can get a fix for this outside of creating another SSID or cabling all laptops to get a gpupdate with the new root CA. Is it possible to pull from the older expired cert and fix it?

 Back in the old days of copper, even if the phone system was down, we'd still be getting phone calls on the main number where messages could be taken by receptionists and emails could be sent to people asking them to call certain customers back.
 Say what you want, I still reckon copper lines were more DR proof than IP phones. I miss copper telephone lines.

 Ive seen ubiquiti, microtiks, and others noted. Any models or other brands I should look at? Not intrested in PFsense as i dont want any servers to deal with. Just small devices with a little onboard flash.

 https://imgur.com/a/2H8JSy7
 It looks like well-known spammers (AdVids with their many domain variations) are somehow using our DKIM to pass DMARC alignment for their spam emails via Google forwarders. If so, I'm concerned about potential impact on our reputation, as well as how the heck that could be happening in the first place.
 Our DKIM keys for the 2 affected selectors are 2048-bit through Microsoft 365 and have been rotated 2 weeks in a row, but it doesn't seem to have affected this spam delivery in any way.
 We do also receive spam from these very domains, but when I look at the headers they're all passing their own SPF/DKIM for their many domain variations, with no mention of our domain in SPF/DKIM.
 Any thoughts or insights would be very welcome, thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is any one in here familiar with the ShowCollector Python script that is available for running show commands on IOS/NX-OS devices utilizing netmiko and Python? I am extremely novice to the Python world but was recently assigned a task of doing data collection on around 100 IOS switches so it’s not very feasible to manually SSH to all of them and run show commands, nor should it be. I need this done by the end of the week which is why I am trying to use this script that’s already published as I know I won’t have time to learn from the ground up by then.
 Anyways, I am not having issues running the script, I am able to run it fine and it “works,” but the account I have for access needs to pass the enable password which this script doesn’t account for, so whenever it tries to create a new file using the host name via ‘show running-configuration | i host name’ it just ends up not naming the files with a host name like it’s supposed to, and overwriting them because I can’t view the running config with my account. I have been trying for a couple of hours to modify the code to allow the enable password, but I just can’t seem to figure it out. I was able to create a very basic script and use net_connect.enable() which worked for passing the enable password, but was only ran on one device and didn’t export the output to a file which is needed. After I was able to get that working, I tried adding that bit and the enable password into the ShowCollector code in multiple different areas, but ultimately couldn’t get it to work, and now I am stuck on where to add the parameters which is why I am here lookin to get some pointers/ideas on where to look! 
 Thanks!

Management, node management, node uplinks(LACP) are pretty much it. I have both turned on ATM and see no issues but I'd rather take my chances. It will eventually become a dual switch setup in MLAGs if I ever get the sister switch delivered... T.T

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I'm not sure which sub best fits this question, but I'm trying to determine what this device is that's on my network. I first noticed the device when I added the new VLAN to my HP Aruba switch (SW02) and it grabbed an address from DHCP. Trying to determine which port it was plugged into, I ran: show mac-address on the switch and it showed that the device was connected to the trunk port, so I SSH'd into the switch that the trunk port runs to (SW01) and ran the same command, it came back showing that the MAC was attached to port 3 which is the trunk port that runs to SW02. I've checked for the MAC on every other switch on my network, as well as DHCP for all VLANS, the only place I can find this MAC address is on SW02 trunk port, and SW01 trunk port that runs to SW02.
 Device details …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am working on a fail-over for a 2nd campus that normally gets its internet from our main campus via a site-to-site fiber link. We want Campus B to be able to fail-over to a new local ISP in case the site-to-site fiber goes down. 
 Please look over the basic diagram:
 https://imgur.com/a/nmMNkDW
 ​
 The SonicWall NSA and ISP at Campus B are new additions.
 We want all Internet to go out Campus A unless there is a break between campuses, then Campus B can fail-over to its ISP.
 OSPF is in use for sharing routes about various VLANs hosted on the L3 switches and the NSA at Campus A. 
 The NSA at campus A does not inject the default route into OSPF.
 I was initially going to just add a static route to the Meraki Layer 3 switch at Campus B with a metric to make it 2nd choice, but it can't set a metric for a static route.
 Should we inject the default route from the NSA at Campus A into OSPF, add NSA at Campus B to OSPF, and inject its default route and set that as a lower priority?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently learnt about the Transmission Control Block, or TCB, and I'm wondering what this means when a packet is actually forwarded from a computer's NIC or how do we use TCB and create.
 Example, Initially, as soon press enter, that the time we will build the packet which include the source(From DHCP or Static), destination (from DNS), and port information. however, the TCB also manages the connection at this point and we get the TCB/Socket information similar on how we build a packet.... So, could you please confirm that we first build the TCB that holds the socket information before actually forwarding the traffic to the nic? Is it possible to connect this during the layer-by-layer processing of the packet in the OSI representation?
 Per research, we can say TCB is the Netstat? 
 Sorry if my question is confusing, but I simply need to know how important TCB and how packets are processed with it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow network nerds! :-) For many years I have been helping to send out RIPE Atlas measurement probes (world's largest open Internet measurement platform) in the US - initially a few hundred as IPv6 deployments happened. There are currently ~1,400 active probes in the US. But with some newer ISPs there are gaps that would be cool to fill - initially newer ISP connections like Starlink and 5G fixed wireless (TMo & Vz). (Next year maybe some rural FTTH ISPs.)
 In my day job[1], I just renewed our RIPE Atlas sponsorship which gives me another block of probes to deploy. If you might be interested in hosting a probe on your connection, I am guessing I will have probes be able to ship them in about a month (given the upcoming IETF meeting starting this weekend). Once you receive a probe, it connects to your network via Ethernet and you will need to use the RIPE Atlas site to activate the probe – which is about 5 mins work.
 If you might be interested, please PM with the following info: Your first & last name, your shipping address, and your email address for probe activation process.
 Don’t know what RIPE Atlas is? See https://atlas.ripe.net/ 
 Thanks! Jason
 [1] Day job is at Comcast where I work on Internet measurement and new standards and lots of other good-of-the-Internet sorts of stuff. This RIPE Atlas system is run by RIPE NCC - all I am doing is facilitating distribution of probes in the U.S. Here's a somewhat recent paper I co-wrote about Internet measurement: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3372135.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I thought I'd share some key points from a talk I did on Shadow IT as it's most often the sysadmins that have to battle with it.
 Tackling shadow IT is a never ending battle. You need to be vigilant and always looking for improvements.
 It's a human problem if your company hires humans you have shadow IT
 Decreasing friction and improving the relationship between the service provider (You) and users is the most effective way to minimize shadow IT
 You need to understand what exists where through mechanisms that can't be bypassed. Instead of importing your excel sheet of NetBIOS names into an asset inventory tool, scan all your IP ranges. You will be shocked by how much unknown stuff sits on your network.
 Tools like WDAC and App locker are great if your just starting to tackle the problem.
 Don't villainize your self by snapping at users you catch with shadow IT. Understand why it exists and what you can do provide an appropriate alternative.
 Because your always going to have Shadow IT take a risk based approach and tackle the stuff those poses the most danger even if it's easier to remove that weird app Janet in finance uses.
 Once you have a strong understanding of what's in your consistency explore more 'heavy handed' technologies like Network access control. You can use these technologies to mitigate while you solve the problem.

 Unfortunately I can't seem to find any info on the screen or the board (they do have numbers, but my google-fu couldn't find anything) as I would love to "hack" this any actually repurpose it!

 However the ISP is dragging their feet on getting us information regarding information on when they can setup the Switched Ethernet line at a new site (this is just information).
 Sadly the current new site has a limit on time to be up and running (11/14/2022).
 My boss wants a "point to point" setup from the new network to ours. I was researching on a VPN pptp from our layer 3 to the current layer 3 in house, however, I find that the Aruba 2920-48G J9729A cannot do this.
 With that said, can I get some suggestions on how to do this?

I researched dedicated internet for some time and realized it is innately different than the usual internet service with shared pipes. 
 This was months ago but am seeing more events of customers signing up for this and then passing the buck to IT and it only being a problem once the cutover happens and nothing works as expected. The last thing I remember in first example was the provider suggesting I set up my "LAN" with this public scheme and basically NAT traffic from one scheme to the other to show outbound coming from their "WAN" scheme. 
 If not obvious already I feel I'm clearly missing something here: can anyone chime in on best practice to get this working as expected? Have set up countless networks and helped facilitate cutovers for businesses utilizing static WANs before, but this dedicated internet setup obviously involves more than just the WAN port config and bridge mode modem that had come to be the expectation. How do you configure this firewall side? Do you need additional physical equipment that the provider does not provide?

 I've exhausted any logs from network equipment that might shed any light on this. 
 Basically looking for a tool that I can throw on a micro pc and leave in a closet. Connect to wifi. Then see a history of ping times, speed tests, and whatever other network statistics it can throw at me by date/time. 
 This way I can deploy these to trouble spots and maybe find some data to back up the claims so my NOC will actually listen to me.
 I admit my google-fu has been weak here. 
 Anyone have any suggestions?

 The resolution is very simply for us. We go into 'Access Work or School', select 'Info' on the account, then scroll down and there should be a red message by the sync button stating the user needs to sign in to resolve an error. We re-authenticate and the problem is resolved.
 How can we implement some preventative measure for this issue, and/or make it so the user is given a prompt to re-authenticate when there is a sync issue. I know it's such a simple process for us to navigate to Access Work or School but I feel like we could cut down the number of these type of calls.

 Have a change planned to add a few extra OUs to our Azure Sync through Azure AD Connect. We've had a number of 365 accounts be deleted and have realised after a bit of digging it's because only limited OUs in our AD are syncing up.
 Process is fairly easy and I can't envision any issues - however just want to triple-confirm (as can't find any documentation that mentions it). If adding additional OUs (not removing any) - and a full import on the directory is performed on next sync cycle - will there be any outage or change expected for current users in 365?
 (Azure AD Connect -> Customize syncronization options -> Domain/OU Filtering -> Sync Selected Domains and Users -> Select all additional OUs)
 Being overly cautious, however figured it wouldn't hurt to hear from somebody who has done this also, for peace of mind.

We only have one production VM left on it, but blowing the SVM away is a little disconcerting. 
 - Do I actually need to blow away the SVM and re-create it to change the IP?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are a few users who are getting bitten with the “my account is locked out every morning” bug. We’re hybrid, the account in O365 is fine when on-prem is locked. The usual tools and logs always point to bad password. User always claims it’s entered properly. Users are mobile, and the problems seem to occur on boot or waking up. OS is Windows 10.
 My current theory is that these lovely (/s) USB docks may be delayed in registering to Windows and identifying keyboards. And in that delay possibly the password, while being typed, isn’t keying in all the characters. Netwrix lockout auditor, DC event logs, etc, never show logon events from any other workstation, so I don’t believe it’s anything malicious. Our helpdesk is done with the problem, so it’s a sysadmin issue now. 
 My insane idea is to throw a keylogger on one of their laptops and capture what’s being typed when they have this issue. In order to see if I’m right about mistyped passwords being the culprit. Because I have a feeling if I call Microsoft, I’m going to be pissing away $500 and months of my time arguing with the level 1 crowd, and going nowhere. 
 If anyone has any other ideas, I’m game.

 I'm an introvert, I like to think, strategize and implement. My background is in network security mostly and I like that a lot. I used that knowledge and some people skills to work selling equipment, and even though that is not what I love and where I thrive, I can do it if I need to. I quickly learn IT products and can explain how they work. 
 I went to a trade school, studied engineering, dropped out, and went to business administration while working at Net. Sec. - I like the IT world, I'm passionate about security and privacy but I also like the processes and structures where I can create a place for teams in businesses can work and can have success in what they do. I always jokingly called myself the architect of my businesses because I can easily connect or relate all the software, systems, and processes to make sense of it for the business and find ways to leverage all of them. And now I realize that's kind of a career as well. 
 I would like to do something with my business experience and I was thinking Enterprise Architecture could be something interesting. I don't want to go back to configure firewalls or anything really. I could sell, but I rather not. 
 Has anyone of you jumped and moved laterally like me? What's your experience?

 Fairly new to SDWAN. Regular client has QOS policies across all their LAN switches which is typical when using MPLS to help preserve voice/video traffic etc.
 With SDWAN, my understanding is that the devices will identify the traffic type and will do its own prioritization without the need to specifically mark traffic as EF on the LAN.
 Can you help me understand this please?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm facing my first software upgrade on a 9800-L, 16.12.2(s) to 17.6. I'm primarlily an Aruba engineer, and not too familiar with the IOS XE series from Cisco, although I have some battle scars from the 2500-series.
 I've read the documentation, and while it's very informative, I struggle to find answers for some of the basic principles. 
 My main question is wheter the AP's require dedicated software images loaded, or if they will pull their software from the controller image named C9800-L-universalk9_wlc.17.06.04.SPA.bin. My understanding so far is that during an upgrade to new major release, AP images are included in the controller software.
 The other thing I'm questioning is which upgrade procedure is the most safe and efficient. I'm reading about SMU, hitless upgrade, ISSU etc. The customer does not have N+1, just a single controller. We have planned maintenance, so I'm not bothered with hitless upgrade etc. Should I just upload the .bin-file, select "INSTALL" mode and run the upgrade - that's it?
 ​
 Appreciate any helpful advice!

Anyway I found a bit annoying switiching between panels, I'd prefer to use some solution like SecureCRT to open multiple session to same server and easily switch tabs.
 ​
 SecureCRT is great since it allows to rapidly switch between sessions with Alt+1, Alt+2, and so on.
 MTPuTTY looks ok, but it seems can only allows to cicle between sessions (previous/next), it doesn't allow to switch to session X for example.
 What your favorite tool, if you use any? Thankyou

 So I recently started a job as a network analyst (with no prior experience, but I've been taught some aspects and self taught with guides and a lot of google). I've noticed lately users keep letting me know their internet is dead, which is odd. Every single time this has happened so far (3 times) the vlan in my switch is showing a vlan that hasn't been in use by this location for a long time. Is there any reason a switch would "default" or change the vlan on the running configuration without a user's input? Obviously it's not a big issue for me to change the vlan and watch the connection spring to life, but if there is something I'm missing I'd like to start getting ahead.

 What are other SysAdmins doing here, or can this simply not be done anymore. :(

 My guess is that I should use a unique username and password for each database. Credentials which I don't actually need to memorize since at the end of the day I always have root access to my databases.
 One project's .env might look like:

 I'm looking to backup around 2TB of files from a Linux server, I want to upload the files to a storage site & download them later all purely through Linux commands
 I thought of Google Drive at first then quickly found out it has 750GB/day limit on bandwidth
 So now I'm kind of hesitating about using OneDrive
 What's the best storage site u know of that has large bandwidth?

 We had several users lose connectivity in Outlook after basic auth was disabled. My fix ended up being to change EnableADAL key to a value of 1, but can’t understand why these clients were opting to use basic auth to begin with?
 My understanding is that 2016 should default to MA, unless explicitly told to use legacy via registry keys. 
 I’ve been reading/researching for hours now and see a few similar questions, but no answers.
 Edit: a word
 Edit 2: A) is the enableADAL key added to the registry automatically when installing Office 2016? If so, is there anything other than manual intervention that would set the value to 0? If not, how does this key get added to the registry other than manually?

 Thankfully some of the guys from the previous IT team were nice enough to provide any and all of their documentation. I still have a lot to go through but I was immediately impressed by not just WHAT they documented but HOW they documented it.
 This made me realize that while it is widely agreed that documentation is critical it has never been anything I've been taught or even shown how to do. Several times over the years I've felt there were better ways I could be doing my documentation but when trying to research methods or templates I would get nowhere.
 Obviously there is the catch that to show how you format and do your documentation you would have to either censor all of your actual data or take the time to input dummy data. Curious to see how you guys are able to explain or even demonstrate HOW you do your documentation.
 PS - Drink every time I said "documentation"

 You may then check the compatibility list and find your processor on it like I did. You may even find previous reports of the 6226 processor being bugged.
 Don't worry your not going insane, the compatibility checker is just broken but fear not you can bypass it with the following registry key. Create the following a DWORD registry with a Value of 1 to bypass this faulty check and allow for upgrading.

 There were no Bad passwords logged.
 It’s in a hybrid 365 environment and azure ad does not see anything related to these lockouts.
 Anyone have any leads on where to look for a global lockout?

 I’ve seen the 2013 and 2019 revisions and I can’t seem to find any good references to what the IT org is asking for. All of the ISO stuff looks very generic and non-specific.
 For example, IT org says we need keycard entry into the server room. Ok great we have that. But to me it looks like the point of ISO is that you create a policy, you test it, and you stick to it. I don’t see where I’m ISO it say you need keycard access. The policy of my company doesn’t say you need a keycard access either.
 So is the gap that my company doesn’t have a policy that says you need keycard access or am I missing the something?
 EDIT: I’m just a cog in the machine trying to understand a high-level view of the process. By no means did I intend to imply I was managing this project or writing policies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for a financial company and about a year ago, our security team put a policy in place to forensically image every computer used by a previous employee. We use various cloud platforms to back up the important stuff, but they set this up to get every thing on the local machine “just in case” 
 It is incredibly time consuming and in constant need of attention or process change due to OS updates or our MDM applying new policies, and that the software/devices perform very intermittently. 
 We use Cellebrite digital collectors (MacQ) for our Mac and Windows computers. Apple is already more difficult to navigate with this, and we still cannot obtain full images from M1 macs. I run into constant issues with the software freezing/crashing and, without any issues, the image can take anywhere from 1-5 hours to complete, so coupled with these issues, I can spend days working on these and make very little progress. 
 Since starting this work, I don’t believe even one file has ever been booted with an actual need to find something. 
 I am having a hard time seeing exactly why we need to have these images. With all the systems in place to record an employee’s work and the machines activity, I just don’t see how booting these images up later can be too useful. When researching, it seems like I am in a pretty narrow use-case, and it seems like there would be better tools and documentation if this was a larger and needed operation. But, maybe it’s the standard and I just have to keep pushing to get this into a good flow. 
 How does your org handle this?

 I'd like to completely remove the social media images and just have the website. I am considering hosting the logo on our website, so we no longer have the attachments. Any other suggestions? Is the hosting of the logo on the website not a good idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just started my new sysadmin job (finally away from help desk!) and I'm now responsible for managing New Relic for my company. Both of these apps are new to me.
 I've been getting alerts from one of our web servers having over 80% space used. I checked it out and it looks like that New Relic is currently using up 16GB of logs in "C:\ProgramData\New Relic\.NET Agent\Logs". I have a feeling this probably isn't necessary.
 Two questions:
  
Is there any way to enable some kind of log rotation here? It looks like we're using the .Net agent. After scouring the documentation for hours, all I can find is info on how to do this for the Java agent. Is there no way to set this up with the .Net agent? If so, how?
 If log rotation isn't a thing for the .Net agent. Would I be safe in archiving (or deleting) most of these logs? Would this effect our New Relic instance?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 This is such a niche topic so I apologise that I am trying to find a needle in a haystack here, but I have some Alcatel Lucent 8028 phones authenticating using 802.1x. They send their certificates to my Cisco ISE server, but the certificate chain is incomplete so they get rejected (as they should!).
 All I need is to acquire the root cert for Alcatel "Wired Phones", but this appears to be much harder than it should be. I have found the below in a forum:
  
The certificates from the Alkatel business portal doesn't work as these are not the correct CA's signed the certificate of the phone. You have to obtain the correct CA "Wired Phones" from your Alkatel local vendor. 
  
Does anyone happen to have obtained this certificate? And if they have, can they please share it? 
 Thank You

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a firewall and two linux servers. I would like to aggregate the logs in a central location, run some basic analysis to identify potential issues and, ideally, be alerted when issues are identified. I realize a full SIEM implementation is probably beyond my budget and pay grade but would like to improve our logging and use of our logs. My goal is to reduce the amount of time I spend inspecting logs on 3 different machines.
 One server is remote and should connect via TLS, the firewall and other server are on the same local network I wish to implement the log server. I prefer opens source on windows but I am willing to consider a Linux based solution as well. Spending a little money is an option if the feature justify the expense but I really don't have a budget for this.
 I've discovered there are a plethora of tools ranging from simple log servers to full SIEM available with a dramatic range in prices. I would really appreciate it if someone could help steer me in a good direction to help me understand what people enjoy using and find appropriate for small environments like mine. I imagine, like in many other areas of IT, there are certain tools that get used a lot and have more active communities. Thanks!

 It doesnt require expensive software to have the visibility or awareness of an incident like this. Does anyone have some insights to GOV IT and how this was even allowed?

 ​
  
I'm using VMWare Workstation to avoid pesky/obtrusive software from accessing my PC
 The employer made me install "Remote Desktop". So now I'm controlling the VMWare and then again through "Remote Desktop" to access the organization's remote desktop.
  
How would I go about working during my trip? They don't allow foreign IP addresses or VPNs. Therefore, the only option is to use a remote control desktop tool such as AnyDesk, Remote Desktop or TeamViewer. This would make the entire thing 3 layered:
 Layer 1: controlling my laptop from foreign country with another laptop
 Layer 2: using VMware on my remote laptop
 Layer 3: using Remote Desktop to access their remote desktop
 Any thoughts? I'll be testing before the trip to ensure it works, but any feedback would be much appreciated.

 Already told him that while I agree that SCEP/NDES is old, its anything but obsolete. If only when using MS ADCS.
 Obviously there's modern protocol, next to custom REST API, such as EST, CMPv2 and ACME
 Me and my colleague find it pretty challenging to get a list of known brands/applications that actually still support SCEP/NDES based certificate requests, as well as those that support EST, CMPv2. 
 A lot of CISCO solutions support EST (such as ISE), but hopefully some of you in this community can help me with other applications/network equipment that supports SCEP/NDES, EST, CMPv2?

 Recently took over a site and their VC provider has told us our CVI BlueJeans is coming up for renewal. 
 Currently all our meeting rooms have been upgraded to dedicated Yealink MTR over the last year with no legacy devices remaining. 
 I questioned this as in my mind, if our devices are native Teams MTRs then why would we need a bridge but the response was it is needed for any external parties joining from older devices. 
 " The tenancy hosting the teams meeting must have the tenancy with the gateway. It won’t work if a guest has the gateway."
 ​
 Is that correct?

 When i connect it directly with a cable to my work computer i can access it through a browser through its name only, not the ip.
 I checked the network settings, everything is still the same, same static ip, same subnet same everything, web access is also on.
 Anyone got any idea what could be the problem? Is it possibly something related to my network’s firewall?

 What is the best way to do this now? I've read that they have taken away the silent-option for non-enterprise editions and I see several PS-scripts on spiceworks and whatnot, but I don't know which one is the best one to use.
 And while we're at it, is storing the keys in AD the most safe/reliable approach? (Haven't done that before.)

 One for games and stuff, where for example it can't be outruled that from time to time something like a mod gets downloaded from a less trustworthy website. The other one shall be for working and for important as well as sensitive data.
 Windows will run on both.
 But how do I seperate these systems? From what I've read, dual boot doesn't really increase safety: If maleware makes it onto one system, it's likely to infect all connected partitions and hard drives.
 Does using BitLocker for the respective partitions/hard drives improve security?
 Switches for 2.5" and 3.5" sata-drives exist, but I'd rather not downgrade from my currently used M.2-ssd.
 Is there any other option than using two seperate computers? How do you handle this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently running three Windows Server VM's for a small business running some accounting software. Two of them are D4s v3's (4 vCPU + 16GiB RAM), and the last is a B2s (2 vCPU + 4 GiB RAM). There's a reservation in place which brings the monthly bill to approximately C$650 (US$476). This is getting a bit too expensive, especially considering that we'd like to add another VM. From looking at the bill, it seems that the main cost is the Windows Server VM License cost. Aside from the cost, the setup is optimal for the owner of the business as all of the employees can login at once (2 max per VM) and the work is synced through the use of SyncThing.
 ​
 Is there a recommended alternative that we can switch to? Or is this license cost going to exist everywhere? I've looked into it and saw that big names such as GCP have similar price ranges, whereas relatively unknown companies like Kamatera have cheaper prices. I'd appreciate any input.

Why does a connection get a fraction of the transmission capacity? This makes no sense to me.
 In the TDM, you're switching between circuits, but the speed of the link doesn't go down based on the number of active circuits. But I guess you could argue that the transmission rate is reduced since you're not sending data when the circuit switched from you to others, so it's a if the network is slower, but when you're sending data, you're sending it at full speed possible by the link. But I don't understand why a 1Mbps link is quartered to 250kbps if there are 4 circuits? Or is this saying the same thing I said, it's a if the link speed is reduced?
 In the FDM, this makes completely no sense to me. You're dividing the spectrum, but you're sending stuff in parallel and at full speed just with its own bandwidth. No?

 ​
 I used to be working at a MSP as a consultant doing it all (from fixing printers to setting up servers). Im not great at anything but i have a broad knowlage base to stand on. I worked for this customer and they hired me as a IT-Manager last year. I am currently alone doing everything IT-related for the business.
 ​
 Now they want me to present a 5 year roadmap for IT and as this is a first for me i wanted to get your feedback on whats important to add to the presentation?
 ​
 My first thoughts are 
  
IT-Security withing the company and how to educate users (its almost non existant, before me there was no MFA, no general knowlage about security, no password on the company wifi etc).
 How to reduce costs
 Documentation
 Going Cloud (started to tamper with intune for easier computer management)
  
​
 Everything is helpful :)

 To do this I set up Generic SAML Service Provider - Single Sign-On, and applied it to the OU where the users will be. On Google's side, I also set "Have Google Prompt for their username" on the SSO Profile assignment. If I use "Require users to enter their Google Username", it doesn't prompt for MFA. 
 When signing into Google, I get a typical Google login page. After putting in the username, it then dumps me to Duo's login page, prompting me to put the username in again. 
 Is there any way I can change that behavior so that Google passes the account name to Duo so my users don't have to type the username in twice?

 How would one go about or how would you investigate to see if your internet connection is enough for your users? meaning if X amount of jitter, X amount of ping latency is enough or needs improvement and what not.

However, the location where this fiber and media converter are located only has one network cable in that area which services some other equipment already. The simplest solution to pipe the internet connection to the router and firewall (on another level) would be to comingle the unsecured, unfirewalled internet connection on VLAN 35 with the rest of the LAN (that currently doesn't use VLANs) on that one single cable. However, that seems counter intuitive. Usually I would prefer to physically have the router/firewall between the internet and the rest of the LAN, and not just virtually. Can VLANs be trusted to virtually separate the internet from the rest of the LAN? Or am I asking for trouble?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Whenever I look up the benefits of http3, I see mostly the fast connection starts and the faster handling of errors. However, it seems to me that using udp instead of udp, would increase the speed of downloads substantially. For instance, if your ping is 100ms and your windows size is 32KB, then you are limited to 2.4Mbps to wait for the ack packet to come back. If you don't have to wait for the ack packet, couldn't you get the full network speed download of 1gbps (assuming that is what you pay for and the server also pays for that upload). That is a huge difference in bandwidth. Am I missing something?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been a Network Administrator/Engineer for 10 years in a campus and data center environment. Only been at 2 employers in this time frame. I've never done any MSP or ISP networking in that time either. I have a great work/life balance right now and my employer is pretty good. I have 2 in office days and the other 3 are virtual days. Work only takes up maybe 4 hours of my average day, and nothing is too challenging right now to me. My team is about 6 network admins and a manager. Medium size environment. 
 I'm thinking that I'm getting bored where I'm at now. I've been thinking about making a move to something else. I'm looking at cloud networking, or maybe something virtual like NSX. I've worked with NSX about 5 years ago but I don't know how much since then it may have changed, or if it's even still something orgs are using. Is there anyone in these jobs who wouldn't mind sharing what an average day is? Are you work from home, hybrid, or in office? What's the work/life balance in your job?

 I had searched this question earlier, but didn't get a convincing reply. And today i was asked this question and couldn't answer. :( Could you please help with specific answers?
 Two scenarios:
  
Area1 > Area0 > Area2 > Area1: Area 1 and 2 have direct connectivity using an ABR. Will Area 1 routes be advertised into Area 2 through the common ABR? If yes, will it cause any routing loop? If No, How will OSPF avoid the loop?
 Area 1 > Area 2 using two ABRs. There is no Area 0. Will the routes be advertised between Areas? If yes, will it cause routing Loops? If No, how will OSPF prevent the loop?
  
I know Inter Area OSPF works like Distance vector (As per many answers i found on other posts), but still not clear how OSPF avoids loops in above scenarios.
 Thanks.

 Any clue as to how that may have happened and more importantly where to track down the cause to stop it.

I manage 3 sites so consolidating and automating management is ideal.
 I see Ansible looks to have collections for each and they both have python SDKs. Both of those tools I would like to use and learn more of. Maybe a preference of python but I could imagine how Ansible could be better for the job.
 Any suggestions? Other tools to use? Personal experiences? Bummed we leverage Meraki but it is what it is.

 A parody song basically introduced the IT staff to OpenSUSE. They did some digging and eventually completely migrated to OpenSUSE back in 2018. This song is basically the IT department's theme song. Thought I'd share this little fun bit from my day working with a really cool group of IT folks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello gents,
 you may find this a funny story, but I started recently to work for a data center provider in Europe. Initially, we were not carrier neutral so we had been trying to resell the internet traffic we purchased from tier 1-2 carriers to our clients as our own service. I mean it works well, as long as the customers aren't the smartest ones and are ready to pay for it. 
 As I am one of the most experienced guys when it comes to carrier network (even thought I am in telco and carrier sales for more than 15 years) they now asking me to develop and establish 2 new products.
  
Become a carrier neutral DC
 Develope a Business Plan for a IP transit product
  
Regarding the first task.
 I am fine with it, as this had been my key business my entire career. The challenge is: They want me to offer these services (carrier neutral) only to the new clients, but not to the existing ones. So they want carriers to join, but will not allow them to approach existing customers, which is nonsense. IMHO. Why should carriers join us if they are not able to do their business and with whom? I need to write a business plan for that and maybe anybody has any kind of templates or something I can use, I would really appreciate it. 
 Regarding the IP Transit Product.
 I need to write a business plan and present it - even though, again, I am not a product designer nor manager, I used to be sales all my 15 years in DC Business. But that's ok, I don't have any choice. So any plans how I can start? 
 Thanks in advance...
 PS: Sorry English is my 3rd language

We do have an office and a lot of people do come in a few days a week as well, so we want most of them to have a dedicated area. We were thinking about using static IP’s and Guacamole RDS to accomplish this. Is this a terrible idea?

When I was researching a pricing calculator similar to the one u/PFK_Manager made on AWS, I struck out, so I worked with someone at my company to research and create one. If you think AWS VPN pricing is complicated to calculate, Google’s is even worse…
 Here is a calculator for GCP VPN to hopefully save others the trouble we went through. Google’s pricing and documentation was so convoluted that we actually caught some mistakes in their own pricing examples. My summary is below but we also have a full write up here. 
 How Google Cloud VPN Pricing works
 There are three components:
  
A time based cloud VPN gateway charge
 A charge for the number of non-tunnel external IP addresses assigned to a VPN g…]]></summary>

 "Authentication failed for EAP method type 13. The error was 0x80090331."
 GoogleFu says that error is something like "The client and server cannot communicate, because they do not possess a common algorithm."
 Wireshark packet captures of the EAP conversation show the client sending its list of ciphers it supports in the Client-Hello, and then the Server-Hello coming back using one of those ciphers. But the Windows 10 host stops responding and simply says it could not connect when using the smartcard.
 The same host works fine when using the computer certificate and the cipher exchange looks the same in that case.
 Is there a deeper/better way to get Windows to show me more information so I can figure out what cipher mismatch it thinks it has ? Has anyone seen this error before for EAP-TLS ?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a lot of responsibilities besides being a sysadmin. And, like a lot of you I imagine, I’m responsible for the care and feeding of things in a lot of different domains. Some of those domains I have a lot of experience in, some not so much. 
 Because I don’t have the resources or bandwidth to research and test ALL updates for example, I rely on the vendor (or trusted third party) to tell me how critical a vulnerability is to know how soon it needs to be patched. MSFT says there’s a domain controller vulnerability, deploy it to one DC today, the rest tomorrow. I generally don’t try to do an analysis to determine for each vulnerability or update how susceptible we might be. I know I can get burned this way, but I rather risk getting burned by a patch than leaving a known vulnerability in place. I do check reddit to see if a patch Tuesday is particularly rough. Standing on the shoulders of giants if you will.
 I kind of apply this same rule in other domains where I have found best practice dashboards. I know that it won’t find all the problems, but I’m hoping it will at least help us avoid the most common pitfalls.
 Here are some that I use: * AWS - Security Hub, Trusted Advisor * Azure - Advisor * Office 365 - Security checklists (forgot name?) * Microsoft Endpoint Manager - Security Score * Crowdstrike - Spotlight * Custom Dashboards - Grafana, Graylog, misc
 What tools do you use? Does anyone have a great tool for AD/GPO tuneups?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently studying for the CompTIA Network+ certification and I'm reading Mike Meyers' Network+ 8th edition exam guide. I'm currently in the last chapter on Network Troubleshooting, on the section ipconfig/ifconfig/ip. He shows an example of the macOS/UNIX ifconfig output, and on the inet line it says:
  
inet 192.168.4.78 netmask 0xffffff00 broadcast 192.168.4.255 
  
I'm just wondering why does the netmask show in hex and not dotted decimal or CIDR notation? Wouldn't it normally be written as 255.255.255.0 or /24? 
 This seems to be specific to the ifconfig output, as ipconfig shows the subnet mask with dotted decimal notation, and ip shows CIDR notation. This is the first time I've even seen a hex netmask, as literally the rest of the book has used dotted decimal or CIDR notation. Even in my limited real world experience troubleshooting computers and networks, I've never seen a hex netmask.
 I've tried Googling the answer, but most of what I found was just decimal to hexadecimal conversion charts, or talking about hexadecimal in a general sense not really networking focused. From what I read I think it might just be a remnant of the early mainframes and UNIX systems, and the language they ran on. But I can't find anything definitive about it. 
 I don't think it ultimately matters what notation the subnet/netmask are written in, but I am I wrong is there some system out there where I'll need to know how to convert binary to hex for subnetting?

 https://imgur.com/a/yRteSjS is the diagram I'm working with. The use case is, we have 10 small communities where we'd like to provide FTTH.
  
We will have two edge facilities. Each edge has 3 routers.
 Each community distribution site will have a link back to each edge facility. The pair of routers at a community will be in VRRP (or HSRP if the router has it).
 The goal is to be a native IPv6 environment. We will have one ASN.
  
Can eBGP, iBGP, and/or OSPF be used to implement a multi-home multi-path load shared environment as diagrammed?
 Given we will be IPv6 native, what would the best practice be for handling IPv4 bound traffic in this environment?
 ​
 Thank you,

The majority of the issues I do get relate to windows updates or nagging. I run them on a local account, not a Microsoft account, and every few months something will happen where it starts asking to switch to a microsoft account or change all of the default browsers or other settings. The users running the application just start clicking through and it brings it out of the validated state and breaks things and I have to log in and change everything back.
 How do I tell windows I want updates, but I don't want any default app, account, or other major changes? Seems like there should be a way to do this, but I am not finding anything good so far.

 So my wife is a database developer and she knows SQL like a second langue. She can whip insane queries in minutes that would take me days to build (and still be kind of shitty). Anyway, I don't do this often but once in a while I'm stuck on something and just holler at her like "hey, babe can you check this syntax is OK" or I'm sitting there and she comes in to see what I'm doing and we end up going over one. It goes the other way also, there have been quite a few times we are staring at her screen chewing over a problem.
 To me, it's not a big deal, it's fun sitting together and figuring out a problem (sometimes we end up spending the evening "watching Netflix"), and besides, we both benefit from the money I make from the job.
 But to be clear we never sit in the same room when we are working from home. There's a fine line between spending too much time with your spouse. lol

 Today, my team was involved and managed to identify the maximum body size that could be used in that Dev Server: 1.35KB (I was in awe). More than that, timeout.
 I then involved the network team, no issues. Checked Firewall, no issues. Checked VMware, no issues either. So I decided to test the Webservice from other servers (using Invoke-WebRequest) within the same site: worked. Test the WS in the same VLAN: worked. 
 Narrowed to the same dev server. There was no error log, no other issues.
 So I asked. "Hey, have you tried rebooting the server today or in the last few weeks?" (this is a dev server, so one of them have that privilege). "No".
 Rebooted the server. 
 WS now worked properly.
 WTF Microsoft?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently have a DFS Replication group configured to sync files between two servers.
 The share being sync'd exists on its own drive on each server, so data compared on the drives would be 1:1. 
 Data as it exists on Server A (parent share) 1.6TB used (402 GB free on the drive). A few days into replication now and I have had to expand the drive 3 times now on Server B, as it has completely filled up its first allocation of 2TB far exceeding the 1.6TB of data it should be getting.
 DFSRprivate does exist within the the share, however the staging area was allotted 40GB and conflict/deletion area 20GB. So if factoring in that space, there is no way (that I am aware of) for that area to contribute to the extra 600 GB (and counting) of data making it's way onto Server B during this replication. Windirstat also confirms only ~40GB of date in there.
 Curious if anyone out there has seen this behavior before, is this common, something I messed up? Any help would be appreciated, Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Help with network setup for small business
 Hello,
 I am a software engineer but I don’t know a lot about networking hardware. I would like to have an idea of what needs to be done to setup a network on a 3 floor building for a small business.
 There will be 26 computers connected through Ethernet (wiring is already in place), and approximately 50 concurrent wifi users, so I guess I’m going to need to place an access point on every floor for wifi.
 There is a small IT room, where I’ll place the router, switches, camera DVRs, etc… though currently I haven’t bought any of the hardware, just the Ethernet wiring from the IT room to the computers.
 Another thing I want to plan for is a possible internet failure, since internet connections in the area are very unreliable, I want a backup fiber connection in case the main one has problems.
 So basically I would really appreciate some guiding regarding a good setup for this. Budget is approximately $3000.
 Thanks in advance

 I'm a full-time student at Oregon Tech with a full-time job. I am set to graduate soon and need to do a Capstone project. OIT, for some bizarre reason, does not provide project sponsors to students and you are expected to find one in a span of about two weeks. Yes you read that right - you need to find a project sponsor with a Capstone-level project lying around for you to complete on top of managing your established work schedule (we're a commuter school). This is obviously insane and thankfully they offer the option to do a research project instead and write about your findings.
 My problem is... I don't really know what to research. Specifically, our project needs to bring to light a problem in the world and how we can apply our knowledge to fixing that problem. My focus for my degree was on Network and Systems Administration. I know how networking equipment/the internet works, how AD works, some basic programming, took several business courses, and learned a bit about cybersecurity along the way.
 My original project idea was how IoT implementation can benefit businesses and the security risks with IoT devices. My advisor doesn't really like this idea and insists that it won't be a big enough topic to fill 350 hours of work for the next year. I worry she may be right, but she doesn't seem to be giving me any usable project ideas. 
 Any idea what kind of research project could fit the bill? Something networking/security or business-adjacent would be highly preferable. Thanks for the help, and feel free to ask me whatever.

 Before I went live with them I had no issues with slow logins on SSH (like 2sec to get in after entering pw) and our observium was polling snmp without any issues. 
 Now however the sign-in takes 80-100sec and they stop to respond to snmp polls once every hour. The network however works 100% fine. If you ping any interface on it I don’t lose a single ping. Cpu hovers around 10% and memory around 40%. 
 Anyone experienced this issue before? I’m running the latest os10 10.5.4.3.

 So I’m wondering what the most efficient way of doing this is. In the past for smaller sites I’ve removed the old server from the replication group, stood up a new VM and added to the group, kicked off replication and waited. I don’t want to do that this time though due to the amount of data. 
 So do I stand up a new VM side-by-side with Server01, robocopy the data, then when I’m ready rename and change the IP of Server01 and put that IP and host name on the new VM? If this is best, do I need to exclude dfsrprivate?
 I’ve also considered adding the new VM to the replication group with a name like Server02 while Server01 is still in production. Then wait for replication to finish, then (overnight) rename, remove from group and power off Server01 and then rename Server02 ‘Server01’. I feel like that’s a bad idea but I need to hear someone say it!
 Or is there a better method that I haven’t considered yet? Any suggestions and/or help is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have an architecture question and was hoping one or some of you networking geniuses could help me out. 
 I am implementing an architecture where agnostic front ends will send backend requests to load balanced reverse proxies. The complication I am facing is that each backend is individual to an organization, so each backend will be spun up in its own environment (containers), but the routing BETWEEN the front end and the organization’s specific backend container is where I am having trouble. 
 The simple solution that comes to mind is to use a header and implement some sort of header-based lookup to obtain either IPs or DNS names to route to the correct upstream. I feel like there’s a million and one ways to do this but I feel like I’m missing the “right” (simple/robust/scalable) way to do it. 
 The goal will be to deploy agnostic front ends as needed based on load, and then auto deploy a backend/middleware-with-lookup-table/updated-proxy-config for each organization that joins. 
 Have any of you solved this type of routing issue? Am I missing something to simplify this process? Any help is appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello and happy Saturday :)
 Over the span of a few weeks now I've been working towards improving our network efficiency and speed as it relates to a few Databases we have over two sites.
 The sites are connected over site to site vpn, thus the traversed traffic has a secuirty packet overhead, reducing the mtu available to 1438
 That number was found by doing ping -f [some-ip] -l 1400 then modifying the number to ensure there was no packet fragmentation, that number plus the 28 bit header gave me 1438, however not the point I just wanted to provide context.
 From there I investigated manipulating the MTU via GPO, I came up empty handed however knew there were other options... Option 26 to be presice.
 I added option 26 to our dhcp server, did a reboot on an end device, a forced release/renew, and the mtu ( checked with netsh interface ipv4 show subinterface showed the same default 1500
 from there I grabbed wireshark, grabbed a capture of the renewal, and the ack does show option 26 with the correct value.
 I've checked the logs within the client however there are no entries or evidence that windows knows what to do with this information.
 so, can you help me with a few questions: 1. why does windows not honour dhcp options, speicifcally option 26? and 2. how would you go about modifying the MTU for client devices?
 ty for taking the time and have a great weekend everyone :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I would be very greatful if more knowledgeable members of this community would help me find some puzzling answers regarding proper disk benchmarking.
 Here is what I have gathered so far:
 High queue with small block size based on median of files stored on the server usually 16KB-128KB
 Random not sequential read/write depending on read write stats in my case usually 95/5 read/write for web files and 80/20 for database. 
 Fsync on, system memory (ram) cache disabled directly in apps used in my case database ( buffer in mysql disabled ), web server ( file logs disabled ), language parser (in case of php opcache file timestamps disabled, error log to file disabled ), any logging and monitoring apps disabled
 Block sector of disk during formatting anf filesystem is equal between tested drives.
 Fill system memory loaded to the 99% to make sure os especially linux doesn't use ram as cache for file operations. Swap file disabled.
 Also because duplicated files in linux are referenced not physically duplicated try to make unique files.
 Also always check extreme parameters like 100% read or write workload or test very small 1KB or 1GB to avoid lags when for example somebody decides to upload big file or put this file as a blob to the database. 
 Analyze data in a statistical manner. When parameters are gradually increased look for linear or logarithmic spread of the results to ensure disk performance is predictable
  
Is there anything more to know when benchmarking disks to choose the optimal one ?
 
I'm wondering if apps for automatic tests like webdriver io imitating concurrent users in not so random fashion should be used beside the usual fio and sysbench i use ?
 
I know that linux filesystem is little different due to points I mentioned earlier, is there anything else worth knowing in this subject which may affect the results of benchmark disk ?

Had him on the phone for about 10 minutes and said he didn’t need to be on the phone while I fix this so I would call him back. We hang up and I see him working on his computer (obviously I can’t work while he’s working). I message him twice - once on the app and again on Teams to say only one can work on the computer at a time - no response. An hour and a half passes before he says “sorry, let’s reschedule for tomorrow at 2”. I say fine and call him and 2PM the next day on Teams - rings once and stops. I figure he’s on a call and rejected my call or my call just didn’t go through so I message him - no answer. I was contemplating going upstairs to my main PC where my kid was (I was in the garage) but decided to stay to see if I could reach him. I call him again 10 minutes later and he says “meeting went over - 10 minutes?” This is when I hear my wife yelling my name because my baby fell from the bed about 2 and a half feet asking me if we should go to the hospital. The part that’s pissing me off is this end-user who #1 didn’t have the common sense or listen to me when I said I’m going to work on his PC and to leave his shit alone, #2 I’m trying to baby sit this end-user because he wasn’t courteous enough to give me a heads up that he was late earlier. I feel as if I could’ve helped my son if it wasn’t for this douchebag.

 First I would like to apologize for my English, I'm from Brazil and I'm using the translator.
 We currently use in the company Aruba Instant On for Switch, Unifi for Wireless. We are going to move to another building and with that came the opportunity to improve our infrastructure. Our company is considered average here in Brazil, we work with road infrastructure works and at the office we currently have 80 users with a tendency to grow. There are about 200 devices. Now are my doubts.
 In the above scenario, does Aruba's Instant On line still serve us or should we think about Aruba Enterprise? For wireless we intend to migrate to another company considering that Ubiquiti does not have support, which one should we consider for our case?

 We are fully cloud and a requirement has come up to implement unique logins for our WiFi & VPN. We are using Microsoft AAD as our identity provider. Plan is to also implement 2FA for our VPN by leveraging the AAD MFA extension for the NPS server.

 It is VMWare running Windows Server 2019 with a Bridged Adapter.
 In the video he configures a static IP address of 192.168.50.201 based on his default gateway 192.168.50.1.
 This is an example of a setup I have tried: https://i.imgur.com/8WPDA1G.png
 Since my default gateway is 192.168.0.1 I assigned a static IP address of 192.168.0.201 (I have also tried various other numbers on the last octet in case it was some weird conflict issue, as well as typing exactly what he did in case I was missing something) but upon validating my network settings I get this:
 https://i.imgur.com/0r1IzaL.png
 And this is the ipconfig:

 And when I try something like ipconfig /renew or /release I get the following error: 
 "This operation failed as no adapter is in the state permissible for this operation."

 I know the obvious answer is a ring topology, but this is a little unusual right? This is in an industrial type environment on an air-gapped system.
 Are there any benefits to running a network like this?

 One of the more affordable HDD options are the 1.92TB 400-AXSD , which are marked as "Read Intensive SSD" when you get into the quote.
 We're considering putting 4x of these in raid10
 What is the overall performance of these drives like, are they equivalent to consumer sata SSDS when it comes to write speeds or are they substantially slower when writing data?

 There are some who are just running into this because they haven't enabled modern authentication on a tenant. If you have found yourself in that situation; I hope this may be of help to you.
 I may have missed it in documentation, but the following were not obvious to me as a newbie to oauth2, and didn't come up in the searches of the forums:
 You do need to have ssl enabled bindings
 While the redirect URL does not have to be publicly resolvable, using loopback fails on machines other than the server itself for obvious reasons. To use a non-loopback URL, ssl must be enabled. Self signed works.
 There are two separate Microsoft guides on osTicket's site, one for SSO (portal) and the other to enable an email fetch. It is easy to confuse the two via search terms.
 Good luck.

 I am the sole network engineer and am making changes left and right to get things up to speed from the prior self-proclaimed engineer.
 We have not been impressed with their support or their implementation of SDWAN. It is legitimately just FortiGates following Fortinets MSP cookbook examples with a few changes. An insane amount of money for something I can do on my own faster, better and more reliably. 
 They use FortiManager and RestAPI Admins to pull analytics into their dashboard. We could get our own appliance for FMG and FAZ to accomplish this. 
 Why does this feel like a product designed for organizations without a dedicated network engineer? Am I missing the value here? Please, help me understand.

 robocopy 4TBDRIVE:\ \\NETWORKLOCATION\SAN /MT:1 /r:0 /w:0 
 I've been able to get some files off, but robocopy keeps getting stuck on certain files, obviously ones with bad sectors. I haven't figured out a way to get it to skip these and move onto the next if the percent copied doesn't move in say 1 minute ... it just sits there forever, until I stop the copy, go into the disk, delete the file and start all over. There is about 2000 files I need to copy off so I am hoping that there is a better way.

 Has anyone seen issues since the October updates?
  
"Because of these additional protections, domain join operations are intentionally prevented from re-using an existing computer account in the target domain.Domain join operations will be blocked automatically after installing the October 2022 security updates on client computers due to additional security checks before re-using an existing computer account (the changes do not affect new accounts).
  
I assume since most people's "golden" images are a little older (e.g. most recent updates aren't slipstreamed), and most domain-join operations occur during imaging before the OS is patched, this might be going under the radar.
 More from the article:
  
This happens unless the user attempting to join the domain does not have the appropriate write permissions (i.e., the user is the creator of the existing account or the computer was created by a domain administrator).Microsoft explained that domain join processes might intentionally fail with "0xaac (2732): NERR_AccountReuseBlockedByPolicy" errors saying that "An account with the same name exists in Active Directory. Re-using the account was blocked by security policy.""Affected scenarios include some domain join or re-imaging operations where a computer account was created or pre-staged by a different identity than the identity used to join or re-join the computer to the domain."
  
Hopefully this isn't as dastardly as it sounds...?

Perhaps I'm just very green, but we have about 300 production servers with all the apps and services that run on them coming to about 500+.
 I'm a new Sysadmin straight out of college with some internship experience and a little bit of freelance as well as personal home-lab setup. However, I'm a little overwhelmed by the size of what I'm getting into with this job. I'm very excited, but I am unsure on how to best go about just getting an understanding and layout of the IT infrastructure. My team is about 3 including myself and while they are happy to answer questions, it's unreasonable to ask them to sit-down and talk me through each server and what it does. 
 Do others have any tips, tricks or suggestions on how to just familiarize myself with the infrastructure?
 I've been given the job of building out a Zabbix server for monitoring purposes and that seems to be a really good way to start as it will force me to become familiar with everything. However,it is also hard to figure out what to monitor and how best to setup useful alerts if I don't know the infrastructure.

 I just tried attaching a visio, but /r networking wont allow images?
 I'm planning out architecture for SD wan mesh behind 2 BGP routers and after going through the documentation and videos; I really can't figure out a way to define two different paths out of the network coming from a singular /24. Typically you'd create your sdwan interfaces and prefer one etc, but i only have one interface.
 Can't do anything tricky with private IP space due to port-forwarding/ipsec and overall firewalling. Im thinking im going to need to re-configure the OUTSIDE interfaces with BGP and get rid of the route redistribution down to EIGRP. But even if I do; i still only have one interfaces
 Architecture
 2 Edge routers bgp peered between each other, distro'd EIGRP down to the firewalls (going to migrate to ospf cuz fortigate). 
 Hoping to get SD Wan set up to pipe critical org traffic out primary ISP and youtube/fb out the secondary ISP.

 The guy that taught me everything fibre channel gave me a list and order of troubleshooting steps. I have tried to reconstruct them here. As this was 10 years ago, it may not be 100% what he said, but I think it's pretty close.
 troubleshooting FC:
  
host (initiator) HBA driver
 host HBA status
 switch port for initiator
 cabling to initiator
 zoning connecting the initiator to target
 cabling to target
 port on target
 LUN to port mapping
 port security
  
Start with 1 and go to 9, for all things able to be checked remotely first, then check physical. 3-7 can be checked partially with one step, checking the switch to make sure they show links. This excludes 90% of issues. Leave checking the physical cabling and SFPs until all others are excluded. So, troubleshooting order should be 1, 2, 5, 8, 9, 3/4, 6/7
 May it be useful to someone, someday.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'd love to hear comments from people using EEE in real life. I recently tested a 48 port switch with all ports connected but with no traffic and saw a decrease in actual power consumption in the switch of ~15%. It was measured with an external current clamp meter, so pretty exact readings and not what the switch measured. 15% is not massive and when traffic actually starts to flow, that will decrease of course. What kind of accumulated savings do you see in your network?
 Have you seen problems with it? Why is it not the default settings if it has no adverse effects?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Evening all,
 We go through quite a lot of headsets and bought a load of Manhattan USB headsets from our regular supplier.
 We also use sophos endpoint and use it’s usb device protection features, most devices are blocked unless we allow them.
 Storage devices are certainly heavily restricted, so strangely, we found new, out of the packet headsets, that are being blocked because they have storage in them.
 Tested on a machine that is isolated from the network and doesn’t have sophos on it, and found that it does indeed show a storage device, but doesn’t show up any drive.
 My first thought is that it’s a small batch of devices that may have been tampered with and is collecting audio. Which if it’s the case, is very bad.
 But if it’s not, what is it for, considering other “identical” model devices from the same order don’t have it at all.
 What can I do to try and figure it out, or should I just bring it up with the supplier/Manhattan?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are using M365 for email hosting with our MX records pointing to Mimecast as our primary email security solution. In recent months we have noticed more phishing emails being allowed through Mimecast and delivered to our users. We have very little in the way of EOP policies in place, our original thinking being that Mimecast is our email security layer in the first instance, not EOP. We're now thinking about enabling the policies in EOP to act as a second line of defence. We've even noticed genuine phishing emails that have come through Mimecast to then be flagged as phishing by EOP, but delivered to user mailboxes due to our EOP Anti-spam -> Connection filter policy that has all the Mimecast IPs within it, which then bypasses the majority of checks. Not good!
 Is anyone here running in this manner with Mimecast and EOP or indeed another security product sat in front of EOP? I'd be interested to hear how your EOP policies are configured, with regards to:
  
Anti-phishing
 Anti-spam
 Enhanced filtering
 Safe Links (Minecast vs EOP - We're using Mimecast, which as I understand is a retrospective check of URLs when a user clicks)
  
Are your users OK with having multiple places to check for quarantined/junk emails? e.g. 1st line product (Mimecast in our case), Microsoft and Junk folder in Outlook.
 Are we attacking this in the wrong way and should be focusing on tightening up Mimecast rather than looking at EOP?
 Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Semi rant semi question.
 Anyone else getting fed up with being asked to handle shit outside your scope while also being bugged and blamed for things not going as fast as everyone wants.
 Post COVID I have noticed a ridiculous increase in wait times for everything. Examples
  
Moved our shop to a wireless long range AP solution to share internet with main office (building is close) to cut down on our overall internet costs. AP equipment from CISCO took literally 6 months to get. Pushed back demolition of building near the shop as our Fuel Management Pump System is there and would be cut off from internet before AP installed if we demo'd 
 AC in shop storage room went out. Was asked for some reason to handle it so contacted and scheduled the recommended person boss wanted to use and it's taken them a week to finally come out but shop manager sends me repeated emails on when this is going to get done.
 Anytime I order equipment needed outside the basics it takes a week or even two to arrive. Bosses complain every time saying it should be 2 days tops like everything is Amazon.
 All Vendors I deal with lately whether its security system maintenance or door fixes/AC are behind in work and take days to show up sometimes. Again... bosses whine about it and get aggravated. 
  
Question is, anyone else notice this trend getting worse? Especially an escalation in impatience lately?

 I have made this question roughly a couple of years ago and people have commented that it is still worth pursuing it.
 I want to ask it again today: Do you think that someone should spend their time learning CCIE? I think learning cloud/automation/DevOps is far more relevant nowadays than the CCIE.
 This is excluding Cisco shops of course, where they need certified engineers to hold their status.

 We only need 24 ports (needs to be POE for access points) and will connect back to our core switches via 10GB fiber. 48 would still be fine if cost weren't 2X a 24 port model. It would be going into an IDF cabinet that is in our warehouse, which is full of dust, so it needs to be something that can tolerate the environment.
 I know Arista has been up & coming but I don't know which model(s) would be a good fit.
 What else would you be considering?

 just a quick question as I'm really unsure and maybe somebody could help me out on this one :D
 How would I have to license RDS when using multiple RDS servers where those servers are NOT redundant but rather server A serves use-case A and reaches VLAN A whereas server B is used for a totally different use-case (and another pool of users)?
 Can they both share a single RDS user CAL-pool? Would I have to have multiple RDS CAL pools (and license servers)?
 Or am I totally wrong on everything? :D
 Thanks. Much appreciated :)

 “studying for CCNP - using Cisco training and pass4sure”
 I had a candidate interviewing not long so ago and after reading their resume noticed they listed dump sites as one of their study materials. 
 This person had a ton of certs and had that they were current slated to take another one and had next to it listed that they are studying with pass4sure. 
 Basically “studying for CCNP - using Cisco training and pass4sure”
 I was super interested in interviewing this person mainly to ask wtf but unfortunately HR killed it after everyone brought it up. 
 A few colleagues basically said well if they still know their stuff what does it matter and basically work smarter not harder but obviously in a half joking sort of way. My opinion has always been cheating degrades everyone and worse yet forced those making exams to write worse and worse questions. 
 So would you hire someone that listed this?

 He apparently had Admin access, because our documented local admin account isn't being accepted.
 It is not bound to the domain, although that is how it was configured when we gave it to him, so we can't login with AD credentials.
 I cannot tell if he used an AppleID to sign in.
 Is there any way to reset this thing so we can re-use it?
 As in the title, we don't know his password, and there is no reset code to use.
 There are no other Mac's available to download MacOS from the store and create install media.
 Is this an expensive boat anchor?

 First off if I need to throw this in one of the other various IT subreddits I will; I figured I’d start here and go elsewhere if need be. 
 I am currently a “Network Administrator”. I was hired into this role shortly after joining my current company after the previous guy left mere months after I joined. The title makes little sense though; we rarely make any networking related changes or overhauls. Most of our environment is plug and play, and I’m not really allowed to make proper changes. (IE our largest location is one giant flat /8 and they don’t want that changing anytime soon). I am angling for a Title change to “Systems Administrator” to better fit the role I’m performing. 
 With that being said, I’m also looking for a compensation increase. While I am compensated fairly…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone,
 ​
 the company I work for sells document management software and recently some of our clients started asking if we have a "customer portal" so they can provide their documents to their end customers. 
 Our DMS solution does not provide this functionality yet, so I am looking to either buy/integrage & adapt a third party solution or build our own. (classic make or buy decision)
 ​
 Now I am currently in the phase to check/analyse what is available out in the wild that we could probably integrate so we don't have to re-invent the wheel. 
 This is why I am asking for your suggestions/recommendations of software/platforms that I might wanna have a look at. 
 ​
 Our clients who use our document management system want to be able to provide a selection of documents via a "portal" to their customers. Their customers might be other businesses or private people. For example a bank that wants to provide the bank statements to their customers via such portal. Or a construction company that wants to provide technical drawings to their contractors. etc. 
 ​
 The basic use case is more or less the same, though the industry varies. 
 ​
 The platform would sit in between the consumer of the documents and our document management system. 
 Most likely the communication between the platform and the DMS should be via REST API's.
 ​
 Do you know of any solution that might cover the basic or advanced requirements of such a "portal" ?
 ​
 I'm also considering building something with the M365 platform (PowerApps, Azure Functions, PowerAutomate, etc.)
 ​
 One of the solutions I'll be looking at will be https://www.deepbox.swiss/en/overview/
 ​
 Any ideas/suggestions are welcome!

 Doing an audit does not show Teams signing in.. Can anyone shed any light as to what this is? We don't use Skype, use Teams of course.. is this just the agent having issues or?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently read this thing called "Cyber Signals" - a new publication from Microsoft. These numbers made my skin itch, they seem so cheap! 
 🧑‍💻 Attacker for hire: Prices start at $250 per job 🧑‍💻
 🪲 Ransomware SaaS kit: $40 per month 🪲
 💻 Compromised PC: $0.13-$0.89 💻
 🔑 Stolen Credentials: $150 for 400 million (!!!!) 🔑
 🕵️ Spearphishing for hire: $100-$1000 per successful account 🕵️ 
 So for less than the cost of your weekly shopping, you can buy a Ransomware SaaS kit (now so popular it has it's own name: RaaS). 
 For the price of your council tax, you can buy 400 million stolen credentials. 
 For the price of your energy bill this month, you can hire an attacker. 
 For somewhere around the price of your mortgage or rental payment, you could pay for a successful takeover of a highly targeted, important account within an organisation. 
 I was absolutely floored to learn how low some of these numbers are; especially the Spearphishing one. Okay, you have to know what to do with it afterward.. But even so, it's a crazy world we live in. 
 Remember; You have to defend perfectly every time, an attacker only has to get it right against you once. Protect yourself: do the basics, do them well: 
 🔒 Enable MFA
 💉 Ensure virus definitions are up to date
 ⬆️ Keep endpoints (PC, laptop AND mobile) fully patched
 🚫 Don't give out unnecessary admin privileges
 💾 Back up your data 
 Actioning the above will give you protection from 98% of attacks, say Microsoft.

 I have two servers running keepalived to share a virtual IP
 and haproxy to forward mail traffic to two mail servers using roundrobin. 
 Where i am currently stuck is
 when my IP fails over using keepalive(which works as expected)
 My HAProxy service doesn't restart, so even though the IP fails over the server doesn't work because haproxy is offline so no mail gets passed through.
 How do i ensure the haproxy service gets restarted once teh server picks up the VIP
 Here is my keepalived config
 ​
 global_defs { router_id haproxy02 # The hostname of this host! } vrrp_script haproxy { script "killall -0 haproxy" interval 2 weight 2 } vrrp_instance 50 { virtual_router_id 50 advert_int 1 priority 100 state Master interface eth0 virtual_ipaddress { 192.168.30.145 dev eth0 # The virtual IP address that will be shared betwee MASTER and BACKUP. } track_script { haproxy } } 
 My Backup haproxy has the same config but state is backup and priority is 50

 I can see the standard AD templates on the DCs
 I can see the custom templates on other devices if I add them, just not the DCs
 I've tried adding a single DC on to the permisions for the template restarting the CA and still nothing
 The templates have the following persmions

 Tried settings Enterprise Domain Conrollers to Enroll too but made no difference.
 Has there been some changes to AD that means there's now an extra step for DCs to see templates?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 currently my company has a set of Cisco ASA's in a datacenter for Point to site VPN connectivity. Clients get a static IP address and our routers/firewalls etc are configured to (dis)allow those clients to the backends. So basically, every client can get an ACL list attached to it. 
 But now we are going full into Azure. Since the Azure VPN gateways only give out dynamic IP addresses our current setup can't be transferred to native Azure VPN's. 
 I've seen that Cisco has the CSR 1000V in Azure, but I can't find anything regarding static IP addresses (or pools) in the documentation. So, I'm not sure if this would fix our "issue".
 Does anyone have an idea on this issue? I'd rather not deploy a VPN gateway for each set of users. ;) I'm also not tied to Cisco btw.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 At the request of the boss, I've been implementing PIM this week in time for an MSP switcheroo next week. 
 I'm writing an email to explain how to request roles in response to 'we tried logging in and don't have access' from the new service desk but I'm having a bit of trouble with the test account I've put together to grab screenshots from - 
 ​
 1- Should I need to sign out/in for the role to become active? The PIM page says the page will refresh by itself, you don't need to sign out/in. 
 I've been trying this for the past couple of hours, and I kept having to sign out/in because waiting 3-5 minutes was yielding no change - the 365 admin page and the ECP page were giving a 'no access sucker' unless I signed out/in.
 Meanwhile, after assigning direct access, then unassigning direct access, then trying again using PIM, it now HAS worked without signing out and in again. Is this the usual experience others have had, or have I just been particularly unlucky with propagation delays
 ​
 2- The Exchange recipient administrator role in particular seems bad for this - I assign it and activate it on my test account, but it doesn't seem to do bugger all. I activate it, I sign out, sign in, do a little dance, and still don't have access to the ECP. 
 Meanwhile, I assign it to be permanently active, sign out, sign in, BAM it's immediately there and works flawlessly. 
 ​
 I've signed out and in to these accounts so many times I'm ready to sign out of existence entirely,I just want someone to confirm whether or not this is the experience other people have had or if I'm just having a particularly bad friday night. 
 ​
 I'm gonna go make a cup of tea and cry into it while I wait to see if it's just been me all along

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone
 I'm the systems admin (and CIO) for a small EU company with a centralized IT system hosting data on a windows file server (in a datacenter accessible via VPN). We also have a Google Workspace plan with an account for each employee.
 Each employee has a windows laptop with a VPN client, once the VPN is on the mapped drives on windows explorer are available. Share permissions are managed in AD.
 Everything on the file server is backed up with a 30-day retention scheme on AWS.
 My CEO wishes to switch all data hosting from the file server to shared Google Drives. He feels the data will be more easily accessible this way, but I really have concerns about this - about security mostly, but also data sync on the PCs and disk space, backups, ... I am reluctant about entrusting sensible data to a 3rd party.
 Is there a consensus about doing something like this in the sysadmin world ? I need to establish a lit of pros / cons to help making the decision : either keep everything as is or follow through.
 If I were to go through with this, are there some good practices to follow ? (obviously enabling MFA will be mandatory)
 Thanks

 With no other IT staff on the continent currently I have to manage offices for a international organization to the best of my ability in my remote office.
 Not helped by often confusing and baffling requests from the head office, so elusive the number of times I have been there could be counted on one hand and I would still have a few fingers to lose.
 ​
 One request that came through a while back still eludes me to the reason why and no answers are forthcoming despite my requests.
 Just before a long weekend I am to lockdown the emails of 5 staff members of head office. No reason given. Just told to do so and if they send in tickets or call me, to let them know we are working on it.
 Its not until after the long weekend and several requests by the locked users for help that I am told to unlock them.
 ​
 No reason is given why, only that the masters of the company half a world away want it.
 None of them were fired as far as i know which makes sense (perhaps someone screwed up or was being terminated and we needed to limit access, that is nothing new to me).
 But nothing as far as I know changed and as all the other IT staff are out of contact right now, I would be the one to remove their access.
 ​
 It just leaves me with a uncertainty in my stomach.
 ​
 I am curious if any others have this happen to you. Told to change permissions like this with seemingly no rhyme or reason ?

 We had to pull drives from a dell R620 server. There were 6 drives in total that had to be removed from the server. It is believed that 2 are in a RAID 1 for the OS and the remaining 4 in a RAID 5 but it is not confirmed. I won't get into why we couldn't confirm that, it's a long story, but just go with it. 
 The drives were pulled BUT I realize that we did not note down the exact slot each drive came from. We will need to pop them back in further down the road. My initial thought process was the RIAD controller should be smart enough to figure it out, but I am realizing that might not be the case and I may have made a grave mistake.
 Just wondering if there's any insight on whether or not the physical slot matters when it comes time to plug them back in. 
 Thank you very much

 The reg key fix does not fix the problem for any of my team.

 My problem is that it appears totally random, I will have clients all at the same patch level, remote to the same server using the same dc. It will fail for one client and have no issue with the other. I will reboot the clients and it will start working again. 
 To add more salt to the wounds the OOB fix MS released does piss all for any win10/11 clients & I’m not sure if they even acknowledged the issue right now

 Server: Dell PowerEdge R7525
 OS: ESXi 7.0.3
 Card: Intel E810-XXVDA4
 Switch: QNAP QSW-M5216-1T-US
 ​
 Hello,
 I recently got a new Switch (above model) and the Intel 25Gb card (not directly from Dell) and added it to our R7525 in one of the empty bays.
 The 25Gb connection worked for a few hours, but has yet to work again. It works at 10Gb fine to the above Switch using a non-25Gb (SFP+) cable, but as soon as an SFP28 cable is used to that Switch, it doesn't show a connection on either end (NIC or Switch). However, using a regular SFP+ cable, both work fine. And the SFP28 cable works in a different NIC entirely connecting at 10Gb, so the cables are fine. And the NIC itself is fine, since it works at 10Gb perfectly fine (and once at 25Gb fine (I even took a screenshot to show a coworker we were finally at 25Gb internally)).
 However, I'm at a loss at what could cause it no longer working, especially when neither the NIC or the Switch is showing any sort of connection using SF28 a cable. And ESXi shows the connection as "Down," of course.
 And the server is fairly brand new, so I know it has plenty of PCIe lanes to absorb and plenty of empty PCIe slots to use up since dual-CPU server. I think I tried slot 5 and 7 in the server. It initially worked that one time on slot 5 (I think it was in riser 2?), but stopped after a few hours.
 Multiple cables, multiple manufacturers (10GTek coded for Cisco (initial); Macroreer coded for Intel (last resort)).
 Dell will obviously not assistance since the card is aftermarket, but I have 2 and both are doing the same thing in this same server.
 Link for proof it DID work <once>: https://imgur.com/a/33jBzsH
 Any sort of assistance/direction would be greatly appreciated, as I'm clueless at this point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, first of all I'm not a high-level networking engineer, far from it actually, but I know my way around most of the stuff we need to do, and as a lone sysadmin I kind of have to.
 We recently migrated to Nutanix and along with the nodes we got ourselves a pair of new Alcatel OmniSwitch OS6900 TOR switches. Tricky ones to manage, but solid. 
 Our old server rack will be decommissioned but our old TOR switches are not that old at all, they're a pair of HP FlexFabric 5700s. Our core switch, on the other hand, is a VERY old HP 5406zl, with rapidly dying PoE ports and a general feeling that the whole thing is going to die soon as well. Switches are still hard to find, so getting new ones would take at least 6 to 10 months. 
 So, in the meantime, I'm thinking about replacing the 5400 with the 5700.
 Now, when I say "core" switch I do not actually mean it, it's by all intents and purposes an access switch: no l3, no gateway, no nothing. All routing is done through the firewall. All it has connected to it are clients, and a trunk to the TOR switches.
 We would not hit any of the limitations of the 5700 (i.e. the 1024 entry arp-table) but we would gain a healthy new switch.
 Yet, since I constantly doubt myself, I'm asking Reddit: am I missing something here?

 Today our company hosted a Town Hall in Teams, and we had some serious issues that our CEO was pissed about.
 Background: Users were mostly on wired internal network, and using the Desktop Teams app.
 Had over 100 people in the call and we were recording it.
 1). Anyone with a webcam on was extremely laggy and glitchy, but audio was fine.
 2). Screen Sharing a video would not show for users in the call, they could only see a grey square.
 Had no issues when I joined on my phone and even the recording was fine. It's when we were live that we had issues.
 Any solutions to this, I saw disabling GPU hardware acceleration helped, but I can't find a way to disable it for all users.

Some TCP implementation use selective acknowledgements (SACKs) to provide explicit feedback about the segments that have been received. This greatly improves TCP's ability to retransmit the right segments.
  
but it doesn't say how common that both sides support this is. Is it like 50% of all tcp connections? 90%? 10%?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Years ago we implemented a solution working with a Cisco guy who has now gone on to other jobs. I have maintained the solution with a very basic level of Cisco knowledge he passed on. We are looking at replacing the devices before we face an outage and are scrambling. We are trying to find a more user-friendly solution that still does the job and thus I seek advice.
 Currently, we have two Cisco 1811 in a data center. Our needs are fairly simple and I have been told in the past we can replace both with a single device these days. We have an Incoming device that has VPNs to the providers and contains all the traffic from field devices. That is connected to the second outgoing CISCO directly and then routes traffic via VPN to various clients based on which devices are theirs.
 Traffic to the internet is restricted with a few exceptions, some IP based, some port-based.
 What replacement device would best meet my needs? Preferably something with a GUI interface instead of the CISCO command lines. 
 *edit to add some details*
 My concerns are really just about the two routers into one or needing two.
 At present, I have some IP routes for each client VPN, like below.
 ip route 10.232.0.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2
 ip route 10.232.24.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2
 ip route 10.232.32.0 255.255.255.0 10.231.1.2
 I also have to NAT everything from one provider's VPN to the client VPN.
 ip nat inside source static 10.232.128.200 xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
 I don't really care about the brand, just function and something a bit more user-friendly for a fairly entry-level of networking knowledge.

 All the options for configuring the VC in central went away. I asked my rep about it, and got this statement back:
 I'm afraid "Virtual Mobility Gateways" are not supported yet. Right now, the only thing we have is "Virtual VPNCs", which you can run in Azure, AWS, Google and ESXi.

Often times, it will just fail to update information displayed without a refresh or dumping browser data. It's also not uncommon for it to just fail to load. Usually I can clear that up by clearing browser data, but now it's just spinning when I try to log in. If I'm gonna throw all my eggs in this basket, I had better be able to get to it!

 ​
 How can it be so bad after so many years this protocol has been out?! Not only can the authentication options be changed only in the who knows how many years old control panel settings and not the modern settings app, but once you finish setting up the network, you can no longer modify some of the key attributes like which CA certificates to validate the radius server against!
 ​
 What. The. Hell. Microsoft.
 ​
 I swear, I don't usually get my jimmies rustled at work, but this... This just bloody infuriated me!
 ​
 And that's not the end of it, either!
 Once you finally figure out how to configure the authentication details... Unless you remembered to change one tiny little option in the PEAP configuration, if someone was to impersonate an AP, even if they present a completely different and invalid server certificate, windows just displays a puny little dialog going something like "Do you expect this network to be present here?" along with a hyperlink option to display the radius certificate, and a pair of buttons - Connect / Cancel.
 ​
 No huge warning like in web browsers, if a page presents an invalid SSL cert, noooo. No 3-dialogs-deep exception confirmation option or secret keyboard phrases. 
 ​
 A simple. Yes. No. 
 ​
 Am I missing something here, or would that take away all the benefits the Enterprise version of WPA2 has?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Recently I had a Cisco AP (3802i) swapped out for an Extreme Networks one (AP250) trying to test something. Got the Extreme AP connected and it connected back to XIQ fine. AP reported that there were several clients connected to it and I figured everything was fine. Turns out things were not fine as the clients (primarily iPads) now consistently disconnect from wireless. Some flat out drop off Wifi and say "Cannot connect to X network" or that they can't connect to the Internet and other times they appear to be working but with low signal strength. I think they're going from the Extreme AP to a Cisco one that's in another room across the hall from where the Extreme AP which is really odd since that Cisco AP appears to have really weak signal going into that room. 
 ​
 The same SSIDs are configured on both Cisco and Extreme with the same VLANs being attributed to both. We use the same model of Extreme Network APs in another building and they work fine. My guess is that the clients keep trying to connect to the Cisco AP instead of the Extreme but I'm not understanding why when the Extreme AP should have better signal strength vs the Cisco one. I know mixing APs from different manufacturers isn't really ideal but this was the only room where we made this kind of swap.

 Sleep reason application API

 Any advice would be appreciated. Even downloaded software “don’t sleep” and disabled sleep but it still does it.
 Edit
 It used to happen a lot more frequently, we thought it could be the cheap adapters we had. Replacing them helped a lot, but still sleeps occasionally but always seems to be very shortly after booting.

For example, let's say you have 100 Windows Servers and 10 Windows 10 clients and you have been tasked with installing a brand new backup solution that backs up files and folders via backup agents. You are creating the new backup job, and you have to decide which servers/clients get agents installed, and which server/client disks/folders you want to select as part of your backup jobs. Does IT just make an educated guess at what needs to be backed up? Does the business unit provide IT with a list of data sources (structured and unstructured) and IT works off of that? 
 In our shop, IT decides what should be selected for backup on a daily basis knowing where actual company data lives. If it can't be recreated elsewhere, we back it up. If there is another source of that same data (and its current, then we skip it). For example, we do backup our home and shared folders, but we don't back up application installation folders.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey All, 
 I have just started a new gig working in a 99% Terminal Services Environment with the vast majority of users working off Windows 7/10 HP Thin Clients connecting via RDS to Windows Server 2016. 
 Users are logging into Thin Clients with Generic Auto Logins and then authenticate via RDC to their sessions. This is problematic for new users because you can't change your password from RDC, at least not without making the process overly complicated by disabling NLA Server Side and a convoluted process client side with first tie logins using a secondary RDC shortcut with CredSSP disabled.
 I haven't worked in a shop that has had this problem, formally I was the IT manager for a mid size org and our TS were connected to from Windows workstations so users were already authenticated.
 The IT Manager's process has been to assign users passwords in the past and set them to not expire. Then he would communicate the password to the user or manager for login. Obviously this is 1. Not Secure, 2. Cumbersome as hell. 3. Several points of failure. 
 This has been made more ridiculous by the fact that about 6 months ago they brought an MSP onboard who is now handling "some" of the user onboarding process including creation of AD accounts and they use a temp password as they should. But, now new users can't login. And my understanding is that new users have just been hijacking others accounts to get to sessions, creating security issues, profiles issues etc. 
 My understanding is that the RDP Web Portal will resolve this issue, but I am honestly not familiar with using it and wanted to see if anyone had any input before I go suggesting this as the solution to the org. 
 My understanding is that Users would connect to the RDP Web Portal via a browser where they would authenticate for the first time and be able to reset their passwords, and from there they would have access to their Terminal Services Sessions, is this accurate?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So it’s that time of the year where we start talking about calibration and who out of the team is the cream and rise to the top. Sadly out of my team of 5, only one is up for discussion for a promotion. The four other guys are just workers and I try to coach them so they can hit that next level but I don’t think they care or just think they are going to be promoted based on their employment length. These four guys work the best bankers hours in the business but if I need something pressing over outside of their time which happens maybe 5 times a year, 3 will never pick up the phone and will respond to my text hours later and the other one simply doesn’t acknowledge it all. The one guy who is getting promoted is super reliable and will not only answer my call but is happy to jump in if needed. Do people really think the are going to get a raise and promotion just because they show up and do their job? What ever happened to going above and beyond? These guys are going to be in for a shock especially with inflation and realize with their small bump, it’s actually going to be a pay cut in the long run.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For the most part, Win 11 is pretty much the same, but there's a few things I wanted to find out before continuing, particularly because the vast majority of our staff do not work from the office anymore.
  
While we're still on Windows 10, I wanted to explore any/all new Group Policies for Windows 11. How do I correctly add the Win11's C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions files to our SYSVOL without breaking Win10? Or are new PolicyDefinitions backwards compatible (ie all old settings are in new templates, so will still apply)? I've updated the policy templates in the past but only within the same OS - is it just the same procedure?
 
I think I read somewhere that Win11 is no longer supported by MDT as they're pushing for InTune. I haven't messed around with this yet, but is this true? We don't use 365 (Google Workspace unfortunately) so having to subscribe/set up InTune would be an extra cost/delay to this whole thing.
 
If you've upgraded your domain to Win 11, how did you do this? Did you use WSUS to deploy the upgrade or did you recall the hardware to do it in person? I know the cleanest way is formatting but let's assume that that's just not an option for us.
 
Did your staff adjust/like the change to the center start menu/icons or do you/did you just take it back to the bottom left?

 I'm a Senior IT Tech at a rural ISP who's just come in to replace a 3rd party support.
 One of the (many) issues I have is we have a handful of Linux users of which I've never managed from a sys admin view before (used Linux in personal life etc.).
 The issues i have are; 
 ​
  
They all want to use different distros
 don't want to be managed via saas solutions
 want local admin on their devices
 they were given windows devices but 3rd party support to which they wiped and installed their flavour of Linux.
 CTO wants them to run Windows with linux in a Virtual box VM ( i dont think this is workable)
  
​
 My current thinking is, for them to all run the same flavour of Linux (Ubuntu 22.04 or 20.04 LTS) as these are both supported by Intune (in its infancy atm but hoping to get more control over the coming months) with AdminByRequest which i'm currently trailing with some windows users.
 I know no matter what i do i'm going to have an uphill battle as currently they have free roam of their devices as they're basically personal devices at this stage! But from a sys admin and security viewpoint this is a huge no go! I want them to have the best experience to do their job as they can but there has to be a line where they are formatting devices! I know if i dont approach this right they will just format it again. Currently in the progress of writing a laptop policy for staff to sign also to stop them doing certain things without a slap on the wrists!
 Open to any other ideas or advice!

 ​
 I am stragling with setup WHfB on some computers in company. The hybrid key trust configuration is completed and basically it works flawless on all laptops. Though, on some desktops users cannot setup PIN due to error saying that this device do not meet WHfB requirements.
 Fun part is that if any other use sign-in to that desktops with his account, then the issue not exist anymore and they can set their PINs. So, despite of what the error says, I think it is some issue with specific users profile. I believe they tried setup Windows hello before the configuration was ready so something might be mixing here now. I tried to delete NGC folder, but that did not help.
 Is there any way to completely purge WHfB settings of user, other than complete deletion of his profile?

 I'm currently troubleshooting an issue with our 2 on premise Domain Controllers,
 +6000 event 521 are generated every hour (Status code 0x80000005)
 From what I can gather, the issue could be that "LSA Queue" is full, because Audit events are generated faster than what can be processed. ( windows - Event ID 521 - Critical Logging Failure on Domain Controllers - Server Fault )
 Now, enabling the LSA event log, shows a lot of Event ID300's containing "Groups assigned to a new logon." and then the device/user and the groups assigned. Which to me seems of no value logging wise.
 ​
 Has anyone here dealt with that type of problem?
 Right now I'm looking into either increasing the LSA Queue, og maybe limit/remove that particular audit event.

 I thought that all serial cables are the same eventual I found out that there are ; - Crossover or "Null Modem" - Straight Through Serial Cable
 My question is all crossover cables are Null modem?
 From the oracle documents the connection is required to have this pin out.
 Pin 3 --> Receive Data Pin 4 --> Transit Data Pin 6 --> GND 
 I have found on superuser web page that I could use RS232 Null Modem Cable DB9F to DB9M which I bought from Amazon.
 Is this cable allright? Did anyone used this type of connection before?
 Are there any SSH terminals that could change the serial PIN out?
 Any help would be appreciated.
 BTW my laptop doesn't have a serial connection, so USB 2.0 is my only option.

 In briefly, I have 2 routers (one on 192.168.1.1 and the other in 192.168.1.254 ) and a home server. When the VPN is off everything works fine, both in safari and in chrome. When I switch on the VPN, on chrome I can't connect to 192.168.1.1 and to the home server (192.168.1.80), although I can connect to the home server from safari, but not to the first router (192.168.1.1) BUT on both safari and chrome I can connect to the other router (192.168.1.254).
 I honestly can't get my head around why on two browsers on the same machine the behaviour is not the same. 
 How can I solve these problems?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 ​
 Just wondering if anyone's supporting Huawei devices that have suddenly started prompting users for having the wrong username/password in the past couple days.
 Have had a few staff in China with BYOD phones (P40's) not able to get their work emails anymore using the default built in mail app. I don't have such a device myself to test with unfortunately - only an old pre-trade war Nova 3i.
 Re-entering passwords hasn't helped, re-creating the account hasn't worked.
 Edit - Azure sign in logs show no failures, Disabling MFA doesn't help, google has no suggestions, Huawei website lacks info and the Huawei subreddit has no posts complaining about this either, so wondering if it's a Microsoft change or what?
 Outlook app proper seems to work, but it seems the default one has better contacts integration, like how Apple's mail app is the only one that works for their contacts.
 ​
 Anyone else? Ta :)

 we're trying to rollout some yubikeys to our colleagues and my boss wants to "force" usage as smart cards for windows 10 (ie: GPO Interactive Logon: force smart card or windows hello). This leaves us with a bunch of problems:
  
we have to use admin yubikeys to elevate local demands
 remote support has to have a passthrough functionality (currently talking with teamviewer here)
  
So my question is, do you guys know any middleware that allows a bit finer tuning of windows logon instead of goin all in with that GPO? I heard about SCInterface or DUO. Any experience with this kind of software? Is it even possible?
 Regards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A fellow SysAdmin was making 80K salaried, but working 60 hour weeks, easily. Typically 5-7am to 5-7pm. Not to mention after hours when on call. That is actually less per hour than average Tier 1 Help Desk technicians make here (~$22/hr), if they work 60 hour weeks with overtime past the 40 hour mark (1.5x). Not to mention, $22 is starting rate.
 40*22*52+20*33*52 = 80,080 > 80,000
 Basically if a Help Desk worker put in 60 hour weeks, they would be above SysAdmin for annual income, even if both were doing the same (60 hours). And Help Desk would be not needing to be on call at all. The only thing stopping this, is Help Desk managers restricting total weekly hours techs can work (in theory). I know this is part of why companies have salaried workers in the first place, but it's still wild to think many SysAdmins are making such a low effective rate per hour.

 I work in a team of 5 (manager and 3 other network admins). There's kinda no direction or vision, feel like there's barely any management from our manager (apart from a "you doing OK?" every few days). We've just got a few projects we're each working on, but other than that there's really no visibility into what's going on.
 Everyone works from home, so it's hard to feel like I'm even working in a team to be honest.

Now if you are getting fragmentation then you should lower the mtu. But the thing is fragmentation occurs when you need to split the packet into multiple in order to not go above 1500. So why would you lower the mtu to 1400 in that case it doesn't make sense.

traffic initiated from internet to 33.33.33.33:65000
 vm-instance (ubuntu os) should take this internet traffic, change the dest ip to 192.168.1.2:65000
 send traffic to router and router will forward it to the web server
  
My questions are: is this possible? and what nat/ip table commands would I apply on the vm-instance?

 note: The server can access the internet because I enabled ip forwarding and applied a NAT rule on the vm-instance (server > router > mgmt cloud > internet)

 I'm wanting to know if this is worth my doing & if it will get me noticed for future jobs in the long run over other certifications.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/xcqz2r/solo_it_asked_to_do_engineering_work
 So a while back I, solo IT at my company, was asked to restructure the manufacturing processes in our companies manufacturing planning system (see original post for full story). As many pointed out, this fell entirely in the realm of industrial engineering.
 A few days ago I made the company an offer. I would help restructure their processes with the help of 3rd party consultants, but I will not work IT at the same time. So they'd have to choose what full time position they want me to be in.
 After consideration they decided today that they wanted me to work full time on reimplementing their manufacturing processes and it would be very clear to the rest of the company that I am no longer IT and should not be approached regarding regarding any IT issue moving forward. This will take effect in 1-2 weeks.
 I then asked, so how will IT be handled when I'm moved off? How will we hire someone in time to learn and manage all the IT processes? They said that end-users will have to step up their game and figure out how to troubleshoot their own issues.
 I'm very excited. Not only do I get to tell end users "not my problem anymore" when the inevitable storm hits from IT being torn away, Im also betting they last no more than 2 weeks tops before they pull me off engineering and beg me to get back to handling IT. We'll see how that conversation goes 😉

I just started this job as a network admin and seems to me that users are complaining about file transfers being slower than normal for a variety of applications within the past few months. I read about different versions of Cisco AnyConnect causing issues and updated a user to have the most current recommended version with no success. We currently aren’t configured for split-tunneling. This is scheduled to be configured in the future. It seems we are getting a high amount of dropped packets but I am really trying to find a tool to find out what limiting the VPN connection/speed.

 I remember other co workers at the time get shit talked about them while they were out sick. Like Managers would be like "so nice of Jerry to leave us hanging like this". It made an enviroment where you NEVER wanted to take a sick day because you would be letting everyone down.
 ​
 Fast forward to now, I woke up the other day with fever and real bad sore throat. I sent an email to my boss saying I wasn't going to be in and he was totally fine with it. I still felt guilty, and tried coming in today since I felt a lot better, but everyone at work was just like "nah go home, we don't want to catch whatever you had", even when I went to tell my boss I was going home, he was totally cool with me taking today off as well.

 I've been searching all over the place and I seem to be looking for a specific traffic generator.
 I'm wanting to test SSL decryption performance on two vendor firewalls at our DR site, with a need to generate x number of stateful SSL connections to say, example.com over time to simulate user traffic at our HQ.
 I looked at packet sender, but the packets always fall into the "Do not decrypt" bucket and don't seem to tax the FW.
 Any thoughts or suggestions? TIA

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 These days servers doesn't have RS232 connection. To connect to network device console interface (for example Cisco NCS-5501-SE) I'm trying to use some kind of '4world' USB to RS232 serial converter. And seems it works very buggy... the typing is slow and the letters are 'thrown out'. Almost impossible even to login. So i'm wondering if there're any additional command to make USB-to-RS232 serial converter work better ? Because without converter it works OK"
 To connect without adapter i'm using this command - and everything is OK:
 screen /dev/ttyS0 115200 cs8,-parenb,-cstopb,-hupcl 
 When changing connection to USB adapter mode - same settings, i just change the device naming to USB0:
 screen /dev/ttyUSB0 115200 cs8,-parenb,-cstopb,-hupcl 
 and the shit starts to hit the fan.
 I'm wondering if it's the adapter fault, some additional settings should apply ? Or the USB-to-Serial adapter suppose to work badly ? 
 Thanks

At implementation time neither vendor would take responsibility for the integration. What they meant from the start is that it's possible to use ETL to connect the two. I had to build it. Now it's my baby and any time there's a problem with it, I have to fix it. I've got a baker's dozen babies at this point. Got an email from a manager the other day asking me to show him how to troubleshoot the solution that his department needs so that he doesn't have to wait for me to be free to fix it. I was seconds away from suggesting that he could prevent the problems proactively by hiring competent people who wouldn't fuck it up in the first place. I don't know where I'm going with this. It's just a pointless rant. The real solution is that I need to train my tiny little team on all these solutions so that we can support them as a team. I'm just afraid that once I let them loose on my environment, they'll just become another userbase that I constantly have to support.

Our Internal CA has generated a new cert but we're not able to add it back in as the Intermediate CA that signed the cert has renewed its cert 6 months ago. Thus the newly generated cert is not accepted as the trusted CA on the PAN has a different serial number (old one) to the one that signed new CSR. 
 As it stands, we will have to replace the Trusted Cert (the intermediate Win Server) with the new one. Then apply the new Cert to all the other PSNs, This means we'd have a total outage across our estate. 
  
Is there another way to replace the expired cert without doing all of them, Our Windows team have advised they will not be able to sign/generate a cert with the old intermediate CA. 
 Also while we do this, how do we ensure the pre-authorised machines will not have any issues? (we have authentication open on the port as well a "authentication event no-response action authorize vlan" but this will drop the traffic into a guest vlan.

 After a machine joins the domain it will install the SCCM client and once the client is installed it removes the "Check online for updates from Microsoft Update" in Windows Updates. I know there are some registry entries you can change or delete to get it working but I was wondering has anyone been able to get that back wither it was from Group Policy or another method? Or if anyone else has dealt with the same issue they has a resolution to it? Thanks in advance!

 I have been working non stop since July while the executives pat each other on the backs and congratulate each other on all the growth they've had. Including myself I have a team of 3. They have went from 300 people last year to 800 this year. Two helpdesk and me the "IT manager". Or should I say field tech/sysadmin/network engineer/helpdesk Tier 2/security.
 They have opened up 3 new branches and bought one company. They gave one week lead times for each to be set up. They have me traveling and staying overnight all over the state for these. They now want a network overhaul by thanksgiving for cyber insurance purposes and a new time keep software customized, tested, trained, and deployed before December. I'm working through nights days and weekends.
 Maybe I'm just not cut out for IT management. I've started having heart palpitations. I'm terrified every time my phone dings. I daydream every time I drive to work on crashing just to get a short break in the hospital. My temper and anxiety are 0 to 100 at the smallest problem. Maybe I should be a potato farmer.
 I was getting paid $50,000 a year at the beginning of the year. I've been in this position for 4 years. I demanded more money and they bumped me to $70,000 and promise to double my bonus making it 10 grand at the end of November.
 I'm trying to just get everything they want done and hang on to get my bonus. Then push my guilt down enough to dip. I miss my family.

 Have done the URL rewrite, and the response from a test done by an auditor is HTTP 1.1 400 bad request, which they (their system) says indicates no mitigation has been done. Is that not the response desired or expected when implementing the fix above?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday I enabled 2FA for all users via a conditional access policy. Majority had 2FA enforced anyway, including our admin account used for AD Connect.
 We're now receiving errors with our Azure AD Connect sync - specifically:
 "Due to a configuration change made by your administrator, or because you moved to a new location, you must enroll in multi-factor authentication to access".
 When I check the sign-in logs for that account I can see that it's suggested that the MFA claim isn't being satisfied which is required because of the CA policy enforced.
 However, that's not the case because we have 2FA enforced and when going through the Azure AD Connect sync process, I'm entering the 2FA code we have in our 2FA app, which is accepted.
 We're also able to log into the admin portal with the same account while satisfying the 2FA requirements.
 I've disabled 2FA on the account and re-enabled it, but this has made no difference. We also don't have security defaults enabled.
 The user is also not part of risky users or risky sign-ins.
 Has anyone come across this before?

We have had issues after installing the October updates on our DC's. The issue seemed to prevent cross-site kerberos authentication over RDP for us. We'd see an event ID 4769 with the error code of 0x14(TGT was revoked). It failed until we uninstalled almost every update from October. Below is the event, the account name section was always empty.
 Is there something I have missed with these updates that would cause this? I feel if the issue was present for everyone it'd be a lot bigger deal and I'd see more information. However, I have seen no mention of issues for anyone else.
 A Kerberos service ticket was requested.

 In our company we have two use cases for sending mails to a larger audience
  
Multiple times a year, we want to inform part of our customers (or all) of increasing prices for our products. Recipient count around 1000-1500.
 Marketing wants to inform customers of upcoming trade fairs
  
I have just now learned about different email marketing software and that there is a difference between a marketing mail and a transactional mail. I am under the assumption that for use case 1) we should not use our own mail server since the high amount of mails might put us on a blacklist - is this correct?
 If yes and we need an external tool for this, would use case 1) count as a transactional mail? All recipients come from our CRM system and had direct contact to Sales at some point in the past.
 For use case 2) I'm pretty sure this counts as a marketing mail and requires recipients to opt-in first. This is fine for use case 2) but would not make much sense for use case 1) as getting all of our customers to sign up for price increase mails is unrealistic.
 I would appreciate some further input to guide me in the right direction. Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I've been noticing recently that some new HP computers run a bios firmware upgrade during their deployment (using MDT). During the deployment, I install a recent cumulative update which I downloaded from the microsoft catalog. This is a rudimentary way to have a windows deployment up to date when delivering it. After deployment, the sccm update system kicks in.
 The process of Bios firmware updates coming with Windows updates is detailed here:
 https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c07009542
 Strangely, I've never seen these bios firmware updates happen with updates pushed to clients over SCCM, even though the cumulative updates should be the same.
 Is anyone aware of a difference between cumulative updates pushed with SCCM and cumulative updates downloaded from the catalog, or of another process which might block bios firmware upgrades during the regular monthly update cycle?
 I don't necessarily dislike the update process over wsus if it takes care of bios passwords and bitlocker lockouts (which it seems to do) but I'd rather schedule it and inform the users if it would come in the regular monthly update cycle.
 The settings titled “Prompt for Admin authentication on Capsule Update” controls the password requirement for use with BIOS updates via UEFI Capsule. The default value is “Disable,” which does not require a password for this flash mechanism.

We use GoToTraining for the classroom meeting. And finally we use Logical Operations for the courseware book & materials. 
 This has worked ok, but it's a bit clunky giving the students 3 different things to log into. Especially for our more novice ones, it can be a hassle. Does anyone know of an off-the-shelf learning system that we could use to combine these things?

It doesn't appear that this is possible with Autopilot - there's no built in mechanism during the Autopilot process to prompt a user to enter a pin that would then need to be used to unlock the drive when they power it on. Has anyone found a way to achieve this?
 This has raised the question whether the additional protection of a PIN (alongside the TPM) is necessary to secure our remote devices. If we BitLocker our drives using the TPM only as the requirement to unlock it then the data on it is protected if the drive is removed and plugged in to another machine. Additionally, if the device is lost/stolen then the user will need Windows credentials to log in to the laptop and access the data on it. If we couldn't find a way to dynamically add a pin to our remote devices, are there any things I'm missing by using this as a secure solution? 
 We want our data to be secure on our remote devices and up until now BitLocker with a TPM and a Pin has been how we achieve that. I guess my question is whether our data on remote devices is still considered to be secure (in the eyes of the industry and best practice) if we encrypt our drives using TPM only as the mechanism to unlock it.

 We have tried different computers, internet connections, and browsers. For instance, we had a 4GB OneDrive...from 3 separate attempts to download from different connections mentioned: 1.1GB, 700MB, and 1.4GB. We just had a 142GB OneDrive that didn't even come close to finishing. 
 Is there a restriction we are overlooking that is causing this? Thanks

 Right now I am in a pickle and I need to figure out the best way to get tons of testing results from production lines, index them, and share them with our biggest customer. Problem is that I kinda have 2 days to do it. 
 O was thinking about a solution: Shared Drives > Power Gateway > Flow > Power Automate > Sharepoint > Index > Azure Guest account and be done with it. 
 Problem is that I do not have a Power license and I can't get one that quickly. So now I need to replace Gateway with syncing on-prem to OneDrive and then run copy flow and everything cloud only. 
 What do you think? Install OneDrive on FS and manually put local folders to sync or create a VM, map the drives and run sync outside the FS? Or maybe a third solution? I am afraid that changing folders to Sync mode can f*up the NTFS rights, paths, dedup, or anything else. 
 Thank you in advance!

 i have next year my exam and i need a project.
 One of my ideas was that I could integrate a software to monitor our Switches.
 If a device it connected to a switch, then I want to see the following things: MAC-Address, IP-Address, VLAN-Tag and the Device name.
 My idea is that with the Software installed on a Raspberry PI I put one in every patch room. So that it automatically reads the port and I just need to enter the room.
 Maybe a web gui to see it from my office.
  
 Is there a Software you use? Or ideas you have to this?
 For my exam programming is not so necessary because its not the main part of my training for the Job. 
 So I hope there is a software I can use.
 Kind regards
 Lennart

 TLDR....Default Domain Policy that is not ENFORCED is winning and not letting our custom password policy apply settings. Also I changed the default domain policy password to not defined and that did not work.

One of those NGOs is organizing a small conference (200-300 people) and have a desire to have a seperated WiFi network and not use the hotel network (1. because hotel networks are not always stable, 2. security is not always up to par/sometimes shared with other guests)
 I am now designing a potential network to see if this project is feasible, as tell them if I can do it or not.
 I am considering UBNT, as I know the software/hardware and it is easy to configure for me. Its a temporary network, so speedy deployment is important, using UBNT will help with that.
 Below is my initial plan and looking for feedback if this will produce a stable enough network: 
 There are two floors in play here (F1 & F3, F2 is not used/not part of this) 
 Floor 1
 - Room 1: 64m2/20 people, 1 AP
 - Room 2: 64m2/20 people, 1 AP
 - Room 3: 128m2/40 people, 1 AP
 - Attrium, 1600m2, 300 people, 6 AP 
 Floor 3
 - 4 rooms of each ~100m2/50 people, 1 AP each 
 Total: 13 APs, probably order a few extra to fill in potential gaps. Probably will we rent the equipment. 
 People have one or two devices, so I probably need a /22. Disable client-to-client communication, to limit broadcasts/ARP-traffic on the network. Alternative would be to split it in smaller subnets, but people will roam around, so I think that is not convenient. 
 Build up time, 1-2 days. It will be running a lot of wires.... 
 Looking forward to read that I am crazy to consider this. ;-)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 Someone offhandedly mentioned here that you could order dedicated Att business fiber in order for them help with the cost of running line/build out (they offer 10k budget) then switching to a significantly cheaper shared business fiber plan once the circuit was in place, is that really a thing? I looked at the early termination fee for business fiber and it mentions that, "The ETF is calculated at $25 x the number of months remaining in the term." Normally the dedicated plans run 24 month terms, so eat a $575 fee (23 months) then switch to a cheaper plan seems more economical as long as you don't need the SLA and Att would recoup their cost but just on a longer time period. 
  
 Currently, the building already has a Att fiber trunk in the MPOE, but were somehow too cheap to run a handoff to each unit. The previous tech confirmed they have tagged and turned on a port for us on their equipment like so but we have no conduit or straight line running from MPOE to our unit. So the buildout cost would be to just run conduit and line to the unit as the main trunk is already in place. Just not really sure if dedicated circuit can be repurposed for shared later on with a setup like ours. 
 Thank for any insight

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow redditors,
 I hope you are feeling great and have a nice and quiet day.
 Let´s get to the topic: Many of my users (including myself) have noticed a horrible decrease of performance for the whole system, as soon as one starts to share his/her screen on a Teams meeting.
 Everything takes way longer to open up and the whole system starts to feel some kind of unstable. Everything you click on has a high latency.
 We have allready checked the performance monitor on the computers. The only thing that was noticable was that Teams consumpts arround 15 - 30 percent of CPU usage (for a 11th Gen Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-1165G7 as an example). Neither the SSD, GPU, RAM or other components seem to have a higher workload. It´s just the CPU, but anyway it´s by far not at 100% workload.
 I googled arround and found out that this problem seems to be well known for many people but nobody seems to have a solution for it.
 ​
 Does anyone else encounter the same behaviour of Teams or maybe even have a few hints for us or a solution for the problem?
 ​
 Thank you in advance!
 ​
 ​
 Edit// I forgot to mention that all of our computers at least have a 10th or 11th gen i7 with 16GB RAM and a m.2 ssd.

 Just wanted to ask. Anyone go for Microsoft's Cybersecurity Architect exam? I've done all prereqs in preparation. Passed SC-200, SC-300, AZ-500 and MS-500. MS-500 probably was the hardest IHMO.
 What should I expect in SC-100, since it's a fairly new exam.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[How many hours a week does it take you to manage 7 esxi hosts (35 vms total across them)
 Trying to get a rough time estimate for how long it takes to manage 7 esxi/VMware hosts with 35 total VMs (combination of windows and Linux) on them.
 We don't need to actually manage the operating system of the VMs, just storage/ram/CPU and networking.
 The things I wondering about are how many hours a week it takes to manage: 1. Updating esxi hosts (new esxi firmware and os) 2. Updating esxi configuration 3. Updating OSVM configurations 4. Securing and preparing for security evaluation for esxi/VMware.
 Just ball park numbers or how many people you have working on that level of infrastructure.
 Edit: for people asking ... I am an admin. Management is telling me I need take over a new vsphere cluster. I am telling them that it's a lot of work on top of the admin work I am already doing.

 I was doing bit a a study on MP-BGP EVPN based VXLAN. I have these doubts which are still not clear after going through some articles. Can anyone please help?
 How does L3 VNI learns the Host IP Addresses and IP Prefixes available on Local VTEP and also from Remote VTEP?
 For Remote Learning, i learnt that the VTEP learns Host MAC Addresses from Remote VTEPs through MP-BGP EVPN Type-2 route advertisements. Is the same Type-2 EVPN Route Advertisement used to exchange Host IP Addresses and IP Prefixes?
 What is the purpose of EVPN Type5 Route advertisements?

 While studying TCP Congestion Control, i came to know that Sender starts with Slow Start phase where it starts sending some amount of Send MSS and upon receiving acknowledgement, the sender increases the Congestion Window.
 Some Articles say that the sender adds one more MSS to Congestion Window and some say doubles it doubles up the Congestion Window. Which one is true?
 Also, when the Congestion Window reaches the Slow Start Threshold or some Packet Loss is detected, the Sender ends the Slow Start Phase and moves into Congestion Avoidance Phase.
 Can anyone clarify how is the Slow Start Threshold Value calculated? Is it a configurable option in OS Kernel or Registry settings?
