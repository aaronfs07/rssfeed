        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I'd like to ask for your recommendation on network simulation software. 
 I'm going to do a thesis on routing algorithms and thus I'm looking for a good environment for implementing and testing hypotheses on routing.
 What I will need: 
  
Ability to deploy hundreds of simulated devices (so VM-based simulators like GNS-3 might not fit)
 Ability to capture and analyze packets
 Ability to connect with virtual devices from the outside (i.e. host machine) (excluding VMs might imply excluding this points, so it's not crucial for me)
 Ease of debug
 Exhaustive (or a least good) documentation
 Speed of development (I'm quite limited in time)
 
 Development / API language doesn't really matter. Any advice is appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Friends,
 Just have a couple questions about moving a couple devices to a new subnet. Bit of context I am very new to networking but am trying my best to learn. 
 My workplace has a lab environment that consists of two Avaya routeswitches connected to an Aruba switch stack and an Aruba wireless controller stack. I need to move all these devices to a new subnet.
 I have connected all these devices to an Opengear terminal and can connect to the console of all the devices. So far I have moved the management IP of all the devices to the new subnet. All the devices can ping the management IP of the other devices. I can see there are many other vlan interfaces that are still in the old subnet. Am I correct to assume that I need to assign all these vlan interfaces an IP in the new subnet? Is there anything else I would need to consider?
 Thanks in advance for any advice

The part that I am stuck with is I can't get my head round the network elements. The obvious answer is look for training and there is a tonne of training. But like a rabbit stuck in the head lights there is so much. nothing that I have found that is what I am looking for. Does anyone know of any books, Training or websites. that is specifically only looking at networking in the azure and aws cloud. Training that bridges the gap between traditional networking and the cloud and explains it in a manner that can be grasped by a network engineer.
 I've looked at the training on offer and not only is it vast but I can't see a starting point or anything that is relevant. Also nothing that goes through the web front end and shows the elements.
 I admit maybe I'm looking at this the wrong way so really just reaching out for a life line. If anyone can steer me in the right direction I would be greatful.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I need a way to remotely connect to many Windows 10 devices (based in factories) and pull the modified date of a particular file they store locally in the same place (it's an xml file). I'm hoping to see if there is a script I can run on a server that points to a list of IP addresses of these PCs or their DNS name and grabs the last modified date and then puts all this into a simple csv that I can import into a DB or show in Grafana, but a CVS is just fine. The hard part for me is scripting.
 Do you think this is possible? I have been give a local account these PCs all have too. I'm not sure if I should be Googling PS or Python for this either.
 I think with PS I can use the Get-ChildItem 'D:\temp\test.log' command for this as I tested on my home PC and it works or Invoke-Command {Get-ChildItem "D:\temp\test.log"} -ComputerName DESKTOP-1234. I'm just researching on how I can build a script that points to a source list in a .txt with the remote IPs and include the username and password and push to CSV.
 Has anyone done anything like this before and think it's possible?
 I was thinking of putting Telegraf of a Prometheus plugin on each PC, but I'm not allowed to, these would have push this data to InfluxDB or Prometheus. I have to use a server to pull this info.
 Any advise or examples would really be nice if someone has 2 mins to spare and get me on the right path.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! I just want to ask about this network issue that I've been troubleshooting for the past few days.
 I'm currently tasked to do a new segment for our upcoming room transfer. I already set up a new VLAN interface for a new segment in our Fortigate 310B. I just added the new VLAN interface on the port where there are existing VLAN interfaces already.
 Here is a summary of what I've done now:
 Fortigate 310B:
 -Done setting up the VLAN interface (w/ VLAN ID, IP/Netmask). This will be my gateway (192.168.172.1) for my new segment
 -Done setting up the necessary routes (going to internet, active directory, file servers, and other necessary networks) and policies also
 Cisco Switch:
 -Done adding the new VLAN ID on the trunk port (this trunk port is dedicated to the FW port where I setup a new VLAN interface together with the existing VLAN interfaces)
 -Done setting up the access port (new VLAN ID) for my new segment which my VM (192.168.172.2)
 VM:
 -Done setting up the necessary IP configurations (IP: 192.168.172.2 NM: /27 GW: 192.168.172.1)
 -Turned off the firewall also just to make sure
 Now here lies the problem:
 -I can't seem to ping my own gateway (192.168.172.1) from my VM (192.168.172.2) within the same network but I can ping other networks (8.8.8.8, other subnets, etc.)
 -Active directory server, file servers, and other subnets can ping the gateway (192.168.172.1) and yet it can't ping my VM (192.168.172.2) or other hosts of that network
 -The ping option in my VLAN interface is already enabled btw
 -When I tried to traceroute my gateway (192.168.172.1), it routes thru my ISP gateway
 -I tried using an existing VLAN on the access port and it can ping/traceroute it's gateway
 I'm not really sure what I'm missing here so hopefully you can help me with this

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi. I know this post isn't traditional sysadmin stuff. Our police dispatch center uses Intrado Viper with 7-digit Frontier Centranet lines. Right now all inbound calls to our dispatch center that come from AT&T wireless or any voip providers are staticky. Outbound calls are fine. Calls from Verizon wireless are fine. Calls from other Frontier Centranet lines are fine. You might think this is an issue with Viper except we have a second non-police location that has a interactive voice response system that is also having issues and it too uses frontier Centranet lines. Frontier came out earlier today and decided the issue wasn't theirs and closed a couple of tickets and said they would return on Monday to continue investgating. The problem is our police dispatch center cannot wait until Monday -we need to get a dispatch now and I've had no luck getting anybody to come out. Anyone else ever run into this issue? What did you do to resolve it?

 By setting a new String value of 3 and another 4 to the new icon it should change all the default folder icons. 
 This works when the view is set to "Details" & "Lists" but does not work with any other view. Does anyone know if views such as "Large Icons" is handled differently for folder view?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our org currently has Accounts sourced in AAD, lately this has cause way too many limitations, even with AADDS, Azure AD Domain Services.
 We want to migrate away from AADDS Joined VDI to AAD Joined VDI for many reasons, including the fact Intune enrollment is not supported with Multi-Session VDI while you are joined to AADDS.
 AAD Join works perfect, however, there is a limitation where you cannot use FsLogix or Azure file share without an access key. This basically prevents us from being able to continue using VHDX mounting from FsLogix, since MS doesn't support AAD Auth to Shares.
 I spun up a DC on-prem and Sync'd a couple test users by performing a hard/soft match against existing AAD Accounts, with PHS as the primary Auth method, I'm able to bind my FQDN, on-prem GUID and Service principal back to the Azure File share on the storage account and I'm also now pull a kerberos ticket from my onprem KDC, which is amazing, this also means I can use FsLogix with AAD Join, as long as my AAD Joined machines have a kerberosTicketRetrieval CSP Set via registry.
 I'm also noticing, since I've configured AAD Connect to use PHS vs PTA, my accounts AND my passwords are syncing back to AADDS, so it's essentially a 3 way sync:
 AD > AAD > AADDS
 Has anyone ever done anything like this before? I'm sure it is uncommon to see my situation/scenario.

 An executive at my company just made this request, they want every email address/domain an employee sends an email to, be whitelisted. This was prompted because a few "partners" had responses to their marketing messages go to their junk folder.
 Whats frustrating is the same executive requested to have "All Marketing Emails Treated as Spam" just a few months prior because they wanted to clean up their inbox.
 The last email I received from this executive was blasted out to the company requesting that I notify them when the changes have been made for everyone.
 I get Outlook has this feature, but its terrible, never whitelist domains. Especially in the financial industry. 
 I sent an email to our CCO explaining how bad this could be but its falling on deaf ears. Apparently, explaining the security risks of automatically whitelisting domains and how insecure email is, broke the camels back. 
 Honestly, I'm not sure what to do. I've been an IT Director for years, I don't know anything else. This company has put me through hell and back and I've only been with them 2 years. 
 You know that feeling you get in the pit of your stomach when you're stressed beyond belief. When the realization hits and you know there is nothing you can do to save your job, life, family. When you're one paycheck away from having nothing and someone with power decides they want to use you as a doormat. That's were I'm at.
 Sorry for the rant, I don't have anyone I can talk too. We're a 100+ employee firm and I am the only "IT Guy"

 SFP+ for 10Gb would be nice but likely not needed (we don't move a lot of data)
 
 PoE+
 Centralized Management
 layer 3 lite or 
 Decent Warranty
 Preferably no or very low annual costs
 Inexpesnive smaller switches would be nice (4 or 8 port)
  
We do have fortigates - I'm wondering if we should start looking at that line of products with FortiManager. I've heard bad things about Fortiswitches and fortimanager though. 
 Should we stick with Extreme and explore their switch option? My gripe with them is we have to pay ~$12k a year for license/support for APs. We could replace all our APs with Aruba ION for what we pay in one year.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To celebrate systems admin day, id like to celebrate my own win that I have an interview for Systems Administrator on Monday morning!! Its for an in-house law firm. I applied on Tuesday (or Wednesday?) and the recruiter reached out yesterday. 
 It feels so amazing, mates! To be seen! 
 It's like a poetic justice thing, too, since I was "Tier 1/ Technical Specialist " at an MSP, worked hard and became an asset to try to get promoted to T2, they brought in an external candidate, gave them the title Systems Administrator. I didn't want/expect to become a Systems admin there, but I was just kind of blind sided, especially since im such am asset and one of the "good ones". And then, they kept carrot dangling us with these B.S titles. More work/clients, more responsibility, less techs, more ENTITLEMENT (please be courteous back! Say hello back, boss.) , and at the same pay and title? Nah. As soon as their bi monthly spiel about how they want to "pave a path for promotion " and "have been working on it" (for 8+ months now...) was done, I got the call. I was tickled. The universe is funny :)
 So if y'all have any tips or what I should prepare for, please share!!! Im setting aside a crap ton of time this weekend to prepare.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm on a corporate windows laptop. When I connect to the Windows remote server (AWS EC2) by SSH with Putty, a terminal is opened but it's frozen and I can't use it. The last printed message is "Authenticating with public key "...." from agent".
 When I right click on the terminal window and press on "duplicate session", another frozen window opens. Basically I can't do anything.
 The SSH tunnel is correctly established and can be used by other applications (e.g. RemoteDesktop). In this way everything works and I can work on remote server.
 Problem: I'm now trying to do the same with a LINUX server. The same happens with Putty - a locked terminal is opened. In this case, RemoteDesktop doesn't work, as it only works for Windows.
 Questions:- How can I solve this problem? I can imagine there are softwares like RemoteDesktop that allows you to connect to a Linux server? Or there are some settings in Putty that avoid the opened window to be frozen? (or maybe is some corporate policy?)
 - How can I open another terminal and connect to the server with the CLI using the existing SSH tunnel?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm a senior infrastructure engineer for a midsized (1000 user) company who spent over 10 years in the MSP space as a sysad / manager. Throughout my career I've had great culture in my remote workplace - My team always said good morning, communicated throughout the day to overcome roadblocks, sent memes, and let folks know when they logged out for the evening. It truly felt like being part of a unit who tried to accomplish a common goal. But at this new job, there's no casual chatter whatsoever - I just clock in on the time system, do my work, and only message people if absolutely necessary. Is this normal? I imagine some folks will see this as ideal but it's quite a culture shock to me and it's been difficult to get my bearings without a "buddy" to answer questions.
 I haven't even met the guys on my team so I scheduled 1:1s with everyone under my boss's umbrella just to make my face known, and most of them mentioned that it was unusual and no one had done that before.
 Should I just let go of the culture I'm comfortable with and learn to appreciate the solitude? Any advice is appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings
 I'm reverse-engineering a working but neglected network with just enough networking knowledge to get myself in trouble.
 We have about 15 VLANS defined on the switch, only a few of them are actively in use.
 There are two entries on our core switch (Cisco Catalyst 4500e) in the running config that I'm trying to figure out.
 access-list 100 deny ip any 10.1.30.0 0.0.0.255
 access-list 100 permit ip any any
 The thing that's throwing me off is that 10.1.30.0/24 is our main production VLAN and there's a ton of that traffic running through this switch.
 I'm clearly interpreting the rule incorrectly because it seems to read, "block all IP traffic from 10.1.30.0/24" but clearly that traffic is flowing through just fine.
 The second rule seems to be a catch-all, "LET IT ALL THROUGH!" rule... is that typical? Best practice?
 As I said, everything works as expected, but the network is due for an overhaul so I'm trying to get things documented "as-is" and these two entries are throwing me off a bit.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Guys,
 We have a private line to one of our sister companies to exchange data, this line has recently changed and therefore, so has the IP
 We currently route via static routes on both our host servers and our guest VMs direct to the router interface IP
 This time however, we’re going via a firewall which handles the routing - there is a slight issue however, our DG has a route applied for the current config but some jackass lost the password (I’ve very recently taken over).
 So currently I’m routing DHCP and servers directly to the firewall which then handles the routing, great - this works fine and we can now see our sister company and reach their network
 However, there is an issue coming back, they can not see us - they reach the router and then the packet drops, I was not aware of anything that would need to be setup ourside to route their traffic internally? It doesn’t look like this is currently setup (I’m not a network engineer).
 If we can reach them, why wouldn’t they be able to reach us? I currently have a firewall configured to route traffic to them, and our guest VMs also are setup to route to them, the hosts currently are not but I don’t see how this would cause an issue? Could it be something to do with the route applied on the DG? But again, we can get to them OK?
 Would appreciate any advice on where to start looking…
 Thanks all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our company was acquired recently, and the new CEO that has taken over has been changing a lot of processes and personnel. 
 One of the first things he requested when he took over as CEO was a "Windows 7 laptop". At first I thought I misread it, but nope. I asked for clarification because I assumed it had to have been a mistake. To my horror, it was not. He specifically stated that he's been using windows 7 since its inception and that it's the last enterprise worthy OS release from Microsoft, and that he believes windows 10 is more about advertising and selling user data than being an enterprise/business oriented OS offering. 
 He claims he came from the security sector and that they were able to accommodate him at his last job with a Windows 7 machine, and that that place "was like fort Knox", and that with a good anti virus and zero trust/least privilege there should be no concern using it over windows 10. 
 At first I didn't know what to think.. I began downloading windows 7 updates in WSUS to accommodate the request. Then I thought about it more, and I think it's a lose lose for me. If I don't accommodate, I'm ruffling the feathers of the new CEO and could be replaced as a result. If I do, and it causes some sort of security breach, my job is on the line. I started to wonder if this odd request was for the sole purpose of having a reason to get rid of me? How would you handle this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I'm fairly new in the enterprise routing switching and cloud area as I just moved up from mostly loadbalancing, monitoring and ISE and we recently lost one of our last remaining primary route/switch guys. But I'm working on connecting a recent circuit we acquired for Azure express route through an ISP thats using Megaport to peer up with our Azure tenant.
 There's still some foggy design once I get the actual circuit portion connected in but I'm thinking of pathing it in to a couple of ASRs in our DC as the BGP peering between our Primary DC and the Azure Expressroute circuit.
 I've got a design picture from the ISP showing a single switch (we have this in our DC right now) connecting to one of our cisco switches using a Q-in-Q trunk, then after that it's basically up to us for the routing and potentially firewall side of things.
 My question to them was trying to ask if I need to be aware of their C-tags on our end, or if I just setup a single q-in-q trunk to our switch and tag our own vlans and somehow work with that after the fact.
 They only replied to me with info on the 2 CTags (308, 307), one for primary and one for secondary as Expressroute seems to setup a couple BGP sessions as built in redundancy, so I'm a bit confused on how to differentiate, or setup the layer 2 config, for the primary and secondary use case on our end with only the 1 physical connection from the ISP.
 Has anyone ever worked on such a setup before with express route like this? I know I'm a bit in over my head but nobody else here has any more answers than I do as most of us are quite green on the team.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello everyone!
 Problem 1 - So the environment has about ~1000 computers. We had maybe half of the computers have uptime over 7 days, and a third over 14 days. 
 Problem 1 fix - I created a task a couple of years ago in PDQ, but have moved to Ninja, to create pop-ups using the msg.exe stating your computer's uptime is more than X days! Please reboot.
 Problem 2 - Now we only have about 30-50 computers that have over 18 days uptime. 
 Opinion - I think the best course of action would be to force shut down the computer after 4 days (4 days for the reason of the weekend, month end, payroll, etc...) and have a pop-up counter every now and then showing it's going to happen. I was going to run a shutdown /s /t 345600, but I'm unsure how to make a pop-up with the date or time of the force reboot. It does do a pop up when executed and when there are I think 5 or 2 minutes left. I could make a different pop-up at noon, for people at 19 days, 20 days, 21 days, and 22 days, with a comment of the reboot will happen in X days at noon (X hours) and possibly -a the previous shutdown command. 
 Why? - We have seen a large reduction in tickets from these pop-ups, and fewer complaints about stuff being slow. However the 80/20 rule of 20% of your users will create 80% of the problems, and of course, those 20% refuse to reboot their computers.

 ....you force all of us back in the office just to suffer now... oh right the office manager that sent that email blast to us? no where to be found and so is HR both are not in today.....and so is more than half of the executives that implemented this including my boss, i am the only one in my dept that came in, out of 5 of us.
 good news is while my office co-workers are getting frustrated, i can relax in the IT dept area (we MUST have AC because of our servers) i can feel the difference in temperature as i open the door to our dept.
 my company's executives are like rules for thee and not for me..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 So I was wondering what SMTP service people are using as I am scouting for alternatives. 
 We are currently using Sendgrid SaaS through Azure and relay mails through a hosted SMTP server to Sendgrid. This is mostly because most of the printers we use do not support passwords longer than 64 characters so the sendgrid API key wont work. We use IP whitelisting instead of authentication ( not the best solution i know)
  
 However, we are growing and more services are using the Sendgrid tenant. Some systems that use this have supporters that would like access to check the mail logs for these services, however, since all the domains are in the same service, and there is no way of restricting ther access to certain domains ( as far as i know) it is starting to become a pain in the ass.
 Thought about setting up a seperate SendGrid for these services, but then DKIM and DMARC will be acting up.
  
 What is everyone else using and what can you recommend?
 Basically looking for something that supports basic auth or ip whitelisting for printers, or relay from SMTP and where we can delegate access based on domain and/or service.

And everyone assumes you want to go from zero to hero. While I really just want to send simultaneous commands and some sequential scripts to multiple devices, and then if I become good at it go further.
 Is there an approach to learig etwork automation 'on the go' as I go about my daily work and I do it in between slow times?
 My idea so far is that I install ansible on my windows work laptop and just try running a few commands on our lab equipment. And from there as I get more confident maybe go on to more elaborate stuff.
 First squirm, then crawl, walk, run and only then sprint.

 I see that the pro bono TACACS+ software has a new(-ish?) variant, tac_plus-ng
 https://www.pro-bono-publico.de/projects/tac_plus-ng.html
 This claims to be able to do TACACS over TLS, but says that this is not a standard.
 Does anyone know if there is much in the way of support for this from device vendors? Cos I assume it will have to be supported at both the device and server end for it to work.
 I can't find any mention of support for it on one of my biggest hitter device types, so I'm not very hopeful :(

All ports are copper 1 gig. We are restructuring and looking to replace the 4500 with a pair of stacked 48 port switches, new hosts and San will be using 10g ports. The switches need to be L3 as they will be doing routing (static) , support lag, and have at least half (preferably all) of the ports 1/10g copper. Want to stay with Cisco, I live in the cli and would prefer to keep it that way. Any suggestions on the switch family that isnt approach eol?

 10 years ago we had a team of 20 db/vmware/linux/windows admins that did only that and life was good.
 Customers and work load kept increasing, yet due to automatization we managed to solve everything.
 Now that team is 10 persons strong and the gain of automatization is dwindling. So we ask for extra hires. -> denied no budget.
 Yet in these same 10 years the following "positions" have been created.
 Project manager ( in the past the sysadmin did this) Service delivery manager Service level manger Service assitance manager Escalation manager Customer account manager Customer succes manager ....
 I'm not saying these functions are useless but this cuts into our profit and our budget for new hires. Also these positions add to the workload of the sysadmin because they can't do nothing on there own.
 So now it's Get a ticket Realise you cannot solve this quicly and need more time to investigate ( 10 years ago you just had time) Write a report to service level manger why you need more time. Inform escalation Write escalation report ...
 It almost looks like I need to write reports explaining why we cannot solve something instead of just solving it.
 And you know the worst part. The customer themselves also have these BS positions and they are happy with all those reports.
 It almost looks like a symbiosis of our positions keeping the customer positions alive and vice versa.

 I have many fileserver with deduplication activated and I'm considering to activate Azure File Sync and implement cache servers to reduce local footprint. As i understand, Azure File Sync is compatible with data deduplication, but it doesn't process files in /system volume information https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/storage/file-sync/file-sync-planning.md
 So, if i want to implement cache servers, they will have to be minimum the size of the actual "/system volume information"; is this correct?
 What are the benefit if i can move to Azure File Sync only the stub files?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Seen a few posts on here about being dropped in at the deep end so thought I'd share my experience of this.
 My first role in IT support, I was part of a 2 person IT department for a small college, just me and the IT Manager. My Manager was very knowledgeable and taught me a lot about the general day to day of doing support.
 After about 9 months, the Manager went on sick leave, which was fine at first as there had been times where I was on my own for the day to cover annual leave/weekends etc. After a week of him being on sick leave and completely out of communication I was starting to get concerned as even though I was handling my day to day tasks, I was starting to get more questions that I had no idea about, and would usually pass up to the Manager. I had to very quickly learn how to manage all of the IT requirements for the college, updating business critical software, dealing with suppliers, deciding on purchases, managing the IT budget etc. 
 The Manager never came back from his sick leave, I only saw him 1 more time about a year later when he came in to collect some stuff. I ended up being a 1 person IT department for 9 years and was very comfortable doing that role. The only reason I left is because the college merged with another larger college and I would have had to become a smaller role in a 6 person IT department, which felt like a step backwards.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I took an opportunity to get some basically free server hosting at a friends work place since they’ve got a bunch of unused public IPs. I’ve already bought the hardware, being two servers, and I want some advise on what I’ve chosen to do and if anyone has a different way that might be better for management specifically.
 So first things first, I got a 1u R620 that I plan to install pfsense onto and have it route 3 different incoming wans into 3 different places. One will be a private network with full firewall and all, another will be a similar one but will specifically run a few servers that are ported out through the firewall. And the last one is going to hold my email server (I’ve got rdns and ip configs in place)
 Both of the “public” networks will be routed to a single server, R720 running proxmox(because I like it) and will be internally routed to the vms it needs to go on. My next no open ports network, is going to be my management network I guess, specifically so I can configure the pfsense when needed without exposing the webui of it to any other server. I’m thinking a little Dell optiplex running Ubuntu server and something j can connect to it with. I plan to have some sort of vpn set up so I can vpn in and talk to that management network.
 I know this sounds not the best and messy, hence why I’m here. It’s the best I could come up with in a few nights. Some guidance would be nice to see what other people recommend for this. I’m looking for advise on more of the networking side and how to more efficiently implement this setup.

I would greatly appreciate some advice from the community!
 Here's a brief overview of our supercomputer setup: we have a head node and seven worker nodes. The head node acts as the control hub for all the worker nodes, coordinating their tasks and distributing computational workloads efficiently. Your input and suggestions are highly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m very curious about how/if network automation is done at your company.
 I’m a year out of school, and I first learned about the network automation trend then. I then did a deep dive on the common Python libraries (Netmiko/Nornir/Napalm) and Ansible.
 I now work at a big bank and realize writing one-off scripts to do configuration management/config checking doesn’t cut it, because while running a script at the CLI works, it’s not consumable for a wider audience.
 My opinion is that building web applications that serve a network automation purpose is the ideal way to do it, but the time investment to learn web development is really big.
 So my questions are what are the use cases of network automation, what is the size of your company, and do scripts serve your needs or have you needed to build web applications that are shareable/usable by a wider audience.
 I have my Devnet associate and I am fairly adept at scripting, but when I see people like John Capobianco and Devnet Dan combining web development with network automation, I feel like I can’t even say I’m in the network automation space.
 Sure, I can commit my time to learning a bit of web development, but with so many vendor and open source tools dedicated to network automation, I don’t want to commit to something that may not have a big payoff.

 Recently, during a security meeting, it came up that how we detect data leaks or breaches.
 Currently, the only way we can detect a security risk is by Cloudtrail logs, which logs who accessed the DB credentials (from Secrets Manager). There are only 2 DB users: app user and redash user (read only). 
 How do you guys secure and monitor DB breaches or leaks? Any tools?

 I'm thinking I'll need the following; - Macbook Air, provisioned by my workplace - iPhone, provisioned by my workplace - USB-C Hub - HDMI and DisplayPort cables - Medicat and Ventoy USB sticks - Mini Leatherman - Screwdriver set - Keyboard and Mouse
 I'm wondering if other folks here have experience working in a similar situation; and have any advice on other things I should keep for support purposes. Likewise any tips and advice for working on a large campus that you regularly cross.

All of my team is busy with our lives on the weekend, nor do i expect them to work on the weekend, especially on something out of our scope. I am probably going to have to end up biting the bullet and do it myself.

 So the scenario is 40% percent of our boxes (4 appliances) are or will be eol soon. Unfortunately that includes the master. In order to not have to change the dhcp/ntp/dns settings on a slew of devices, we'll have to re-ip the candidate box. I've documented all the boxes involved: where they're connected, vlans, IP addresses. That's how far I've gone. The new boxes are already in prod by the way. Let's just say the guy who was the admin for this has left abruptly, mid-deployment
 The part I'm not too familiar with is the backend. What will I need; configs, dns, etc that will make this transition as smooth as possible?

If I run a continuous ping from any device on the LAN to anything on the WAN, at random points throughout the day, it will just time out. The Time outs may happen once every so often or may be as dramatic as cutting in and out like crazy for several minutes Users are noticing the outages and having trouble loading web apps for work. The only thing that is consistent is that all the devices on the LAN are facing the issue. The Gateway is a SonicWall, and no devices ever have trouble pinging it. The issues occur pinging the outside world. I am confident that it is an ISP issue with ether a faulty connection outside the facility or hardware issue however I want to rule out anything I can on my LAN to make sure nothing is eating the bandwidth of the connection or something else I am not thinking of.
 TLDR: Want to make sure I have all my bases covered on network outages for MSP client.

 I was looking at jobs on LinkedIn recently, and saw IT Analyst positions requiring at least 5 years of experience. What were they paying? $55-70k CAD. This is $40k-55k USD BEFORE tax. Tax in Canada is very high.
 Rent for a 1 bedroom apartment in this city is about 2000 CAD. If you were making a wage like this, you'd barely have any savings after expenses.
 It used to be that working IT gave you a comfortable wage - for companies to openly advertise these kind of wages is absolutely brutal. They must be doing this because so many candidates would reject them purely on this. Which brings me to the next point: people that knowingly apply for these roles are desperate and being taken advantage of. I would say don't get taken advantage of but when you are desperate....

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm currently working with a healthcare-related entity in need of a cloud-based VPN solution. The main purpose is to provide secure access to a web-based SaaS application. Specifically, we require a VPN that offers static IP addresses for all users to comply with the SaaS provider's IP whitelist requirements.
 Moreover, we need the VPN client to support split-tunneling to allow local network devices and resources to be accessed when necessary. It would be ideal if split-tunneling could be achieved using FQDNs rather than just IPs.
 Our total user count will be around 50, and as a cloud-based company, we do not have any on-premises equipment. Our users are distributed, working from either their homes or shared office spaces.
 So far I've looked at:
  
Cloudflare: It looks like a promising option, especially with the freemium plan that suits our user count. I would love to hear your opinions on this.
 ZScaler: I'm in the process of scheduling a call with their sales representative to get more information.
 Netmaker: This option is based on WireGuard and seems promising, but I'm keen to know if any of you have experience using it.
  Palo Alto Prisma Access: While it fits our needs, the minimum requirement of 200 user licenses might be cost-prohibitive for us.
 Palo Alto VM-series firewall in Azure: Unfortunately, I don't have a frame of reference on Azure costs, so any insights would be helpful.
 NordVPN: Not a suitable option as it does not support split-tunneling, as confirmed by their representative.
  Perimeter81: I'm not familiar with this company, but it was referred to me by NordVPN.
  
Are there any other good VPN providers out there?

 neighbor E.F.G.H route-map localonly out
 interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1
 ip address A.B.C.1 255.255.255.0 
 Our Palo Alto firewall WAN interface to public internet is configured with IP/CIDR as A.B.C.2/24 and it has a default route via A.B.C.1.
 We now want to set up an AWS Direct Connection using A.B.C.254/31 (.254 on our firewall and .255 on the AWS router). We are using the private ASN 64512.
 Instructions from Amazon have us configuring an interface on the firewall (actually a subinterface with VLAN tagging) using the A.B.C.254/31 address before setting up BGP.
 However, the firewall does not allow this since the new interface has an overlapping subnet with the WAN interface.
 What's the best thing to do here?
 1. I am thinking we would change the netmask on the Cisco router to 255.255.255.128 and change the firewall WAN link to /25. Yes?
 2. But then we're only advertising addresses .1-128 to the Internet, and .254-.255 to AWS. What would be the best way to tell the firewall and router to keep using .129-253 for our public WAN link?

 "Because of an error in data encryption, this session will end. Please try connecting to the remote computer again."
 The Windows 11 PC and the Server 2012 R2 servers have been fully patched and all Windows updates installed. 
 The most recently attempt was to start the Link-Layer Topology Discovery Mapper service which was set to manual, but that did not help.
 Any suggestions?

 With that said, we have a team that has built a Grafana dashboard for some metrics and telemetry data for non-network gear within our footprint. I was thinking of getting assistance from him to help build one for the network. I just don't know what's supported, so for those that have done this already, what information do you have on there?
 I figure device uptime, maybe bandwidth statistics for our core, some interface statistics. Anything else that would be helpful and relevant? I understand it could differ from network to network, but just trying to get a feel overall of what you all use for your dashboard.
 Any info would be appreciated. Thank you.

 What I'm trying to figure out is, we have Rancid running on CentOS and occasionally run/install the typical system updates. I'm trying to figure out how to update Rancid from 3.11 to the latest 3.13. The UPGRADE and README file in the Rancid .tar is very vague, and I can't follow because I do not understand. So I am asking if anyone can provide a step by step procedure to update these application.
 I can download the .tar and extract it, but that's about as far as I can get.
 cd /home/rancid/tar/
 wget ftp://ftp.shrubbery.net/pub/rancid/rancid-3.13.tar.gz 
 tar -xzvf rancid-3.13.tar.gz

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So long story short we had a "pentest" by our cyber insurance company which seems like they just did a basic port scan. 
 ​
 They are highly concerned to the point where they may not give us coverage because of this:
 ​
 They found port 443 open on our Cisco router for our VPN. They can go to the external IP and it resolves to a cisco page (X.X.X.X/+CSCOE+/logon.html). If you have credentials for that portal, you can download the Cisco Anyconnect client. I went to an external network and tried it. I couldn't find any other functionality to that page other than the client download. 
 ​
 All of this stuff was set up long before my time at the company, but is this not standard? From my understanding the router portal is a feature that was put there on purpose. 
 ​
 They are really insisting that we shut down access to port 443. I am really insisting that closing that port would render our VPN services non-existent. 
 Are they being idiots? Am I being an idiot? Are we all being idiots? VPNs and routers are NOT my strong suit so I'm worried I'm missing something obvious. 
 Should I stand my ground that this guy who did the port scan doesn't understand VPNs?

Despite several reports to proofpoint with permalinks to the offending emails and a description of the problem they are still coming and I had to block that domain, but it will only stop them until they change to another domain. I am also filtering for the phrase "Please Protect your account" the subjects so far have been userfirstname.userlastname, Please Protect your account, with the same thing showing up as the first line in the email
 I have saved the .eml files for several dozen of these emails and sent them to Amazon EC2 abuse and they have been extremely unhelpful. You would think they would want to stop these assholes as it is making them look bad for allowing it to happen. I am to the point of just blocking all emails coming from any amazon aws or ec2 site.
 If I block .png attachments it will probably mess up email signatures that use png files.
 It is getting annoying, as these emails sail right through Microsoft's defender phishing detection and through proofpoint since they are using a png file to try to trick people into falling for the phish.

 Posting here as I was encouraged by you all last time. 
 The foster care charity I am a volunteer at (I work with/support Foster Dads) has asked if I would be able to help try to find laptops again for foster kids going back to school. My company marketing department helped me make a flyer and post on LinkedIn to try to collect any decommissioned machines from anyone. I kept it pretty brief for LinkedIn sake, but if anyone does have some laptops, they'd be happy to donate to get repurposed for foster Kids in the Denver area, I would gladly take them and send you a tax write off letter for your trouble. 
 Linkedin Post: https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7090341579864903680/
 FAQ (for IT people): 
  
Yes, we are happy to take laptops without hard drives. 
 We cannot take desktops as foster kids move around a lot and this makes it hard for them to transport, but I can connect you with a charity that does if you'd like.

 What does a certificate have to do with this, considering its an inside hosted page we are reaching? Why will it not work without a certificate? And on top of that, why does it have to be a a legit purchases cert, and not a self signed or self generated one?

 I'd like to carve off a hunk for work only, isolated/sandboxed, AzureAD joined, with tighter controls, hardened, etc. 
 90% of what I do is live in a browser for work, with some remote access (RDP, win32 based remote control app, PuTTY, that's about it) and obviously Office 365 (Outlook, OneDrive, Teams)
 My first thought was Windows 11 Sandbox, but persistence would be an issue, although I could probably spin up an image that's preloaded; I'm not sure if that's supported.
 There is obviously Hyper-V, but I'm not sure how well it would perform for webcam pass-thru, general video performance, etc.
 Figured I'd ask before reinventing the wheel...

More specifically it performs a DNS (Domain Name System) query for a SRV (Service) record. It will then make a connection to the domain controller. If this is all successful, the domain profile is set..
  
It says it will make a connection to “the” domain controller. What if that specific domain controller is offline, inaccessible, rebooting etc. at that exact moment? It will assign the network as a Public and set the windows Firewall to the Public Network profile.
 How often will it retry again and will it keep trying the same DC host from its local DNS cache or will it do a new query getting the same DC over and over from the SRV lookup or should it get different DC entry from the SRV record with each new query?

For my first assignment they got us to create an EC2 instance and run commands based on the questions. Sometimes giving the commands to run and asking us to determine what some parts of the output mean and other times finding the command to use and then carrying out that same process.
 Is there any good resources for this as I feel so incredibly lost right now and most websites I visit when trying to understand all of this aren’t very helpful.

It is common for companies to thank their sysadmins on this day, giving them cake, pizza or all going to a bar together. 
 Many start-ups and large companies hold sales of their products and give discounts. I searched the internet and found a few such offers, which might be useful to someone:
 Linux Foundation offers 50% on bootcamps, training courses and certifications. 
 Getscreen.me remote desktop give 25% discount on first subscription. 
 PrinterLogic is giving away free t-shirts for sysadmins.
 Cafepress presents gifts for sysadmins (you can finally buy a new mug!:-))
 Lot of funny sysadmin stickers on Redbubble
 That's all I've been able to find on the internet so far. It's strange, in previous years there were many more such offers (please comment if you know of any other discounts or freebies.
 And have a nice Sysadmin Day to ya all!

MS provides a script here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/ediscovery-use-a-script-to-add-users-to-a-hold that would be perfect if only it worked for me. The script runs all the way to the end but when I try to put my test user on hold I get the error: "Creating the hold named newhold. Please wait...WARNING: An unexpected error has occurred and a Watson dump is being generated: The value is set to emptyParameter name: locationWARNING: Task module "ReportExceptionModule.ReportException" fails with exception "Access to the path 'C:\ExchangeSetupLogs\ExchangeSetupWatson.log' is denied.". This module is skipped. Task execution result should not be affected.New-CaseHoldPolicy: The value is set to emptyParameter name: locationNew-CaseHoldRule: Policy "newhold" wasn't found. Make sure you typed the policy name correctly."
 Can someone else test this to see if the script is faulty or if it just something on my end? Its very odd that its throwing empty value codes at me as it prompts you for input along the way and they have all been satisfied. The sanity check would really help.

 I have one tenant (source) to which guest users are invited. We have configured MFA for all accounts including members and guest users. One company we depend on, have some stubborn users (~100) who claim they don't have corporate phones and they do not wish to set up SMS or MS Auth app on private phones. We don't want to exclude those users. How to handle that? 
 AFAIK - FIDO2 keys are not an option along with OATH hardware tokens - Microsoft doesn't support that for guest accounts. 
 Maybe software tokens? What do you think?

 I'd like to advertise BCE to the user base but am concerned that, on the occasion that a user is not signed in to Edge with their work account, they can just plonk any sensitive data they fancy in to the generic (unprotected) Bing Chat. 
 The only method of ensuring this looks to be to force Edge sign-in. This would be acceptable if edge didn't crash as soon as you enable the account filter GPO to only allow logins to *@contoso.com.

 for some time now i have a problem with our NetDrives for users connected via VPN. The users get the following error message:
 "Microsoft Windows Network: The local device name is already in use. This connection has not been restored."
 The mapped drives are shares on a Windows Server 2022 and are connected to the clients via GPO. The users connect to our company network with the Watchguard SSL Client. The drives work without any problems for everyone inside our company network, but not when connected via VPN. When i try to connect to the Server manually it works just fine. At the moment i gave the users a script, which removes all NetDrives and connects them again. The wierd thing is it works sometimes for some users, what makes me think its some kind of DNS error. I would appreciate every tip i can get, thanks.

 Has anyone already encountered the problem?

In my research I stumbled upon microvms as an alternative to containers and some cloud providers like fly.io and Koyeb are already using them but I wonder why they're not more popular (especially since AWS open sourced one of the main tools for it).
 Have you had any experiences with microvms or opinions?

 Connecting out to a 3rd party provider via an nginx proxy, they very kindly changed the IP address behind their URL without telling us. Nginx never updated the resolution and we had to reload config on the proxy servers to force an update.
 Easy fix in the end but a nightmare to get there. Documentation will be updated.

I used to own hp laser printers, eventually sold them as they were monochrome and lasted me a good 20 years. I hear most of the printers these days are junk...
 With that, looking to buy a laserjet that does color, duplex, wired (don't want to deal with wifi dying eventually or losing its mind) and or usb. Photocopy would be ideal. Don't need scanning...
 Use is for home business for recipes, labels and home school photocopying. Ideally a limit of $500 or less. I don't mind buying older printers on ebay or the like if they are solid models.
 Thanks in advance!

Now I'm in a new spot that uses Box for cloud file storage (which is GREAT as a sharepoint replacment but garbage as a OneDrive replacement). 
 Has anyone successfully used Box AND OneDrive? I'm thinking of using Box for cloud file storage and collab but silently turning on OneDrive with KFM solely to automatically back up documents/desktop/pictures. We are an E3 shop, so we have OneDrive already, the sync client has just been disabled via dism during task sequence (don't ask). So essentially OneDrive is there, but only in the cloud. 
 Unfortunately, I don't have the option to move the org OFF of Box. I'm trying to simplify refreshing PCs where now the techs are "manually backing up user data from a C drive" to a temporary file share, then manually copying it back down on the new PC (like it's 1999 LOL) 
 Anyone have any experience with both?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm feeling a mix of emotions as I write this post. After an entire year of unemployment due to being laid off from my previous job because of downsizing, I finally received a job offer from a new company. Initially, it felt like a glimmer of hope amidst the struggles, nightmares, and exhausting ordeal of the recruiting process.
 However, my excitement turned to severe disappointment when I realized I had fallen victim to a bait-and-switch situation. Throughout the hiring process, the recruiter assured me that the job was fully remote, which was crucial for me. But at the final stages of the interview, they dropped the bombshell that it's an onsite job, and I could only negotiate remote work after three months.
 I feel utterly lied to and betrayed, especially after enduring countless rejections and navigating the recruiting hell. It's frustrating to finally receive an offer, only to discover that it's not what was promised.
 This deceit has left me feeling so angry that it triggered a migraine, and it's taken all my strength to write this post seeking your advice and assistance. I don't know what to do next. I'm desperate for some guidance as I navigate this challenging decision.

 In my lab, this is my current setup. The two core switches are MLAG'd together w/ VRRP for core redundancy, that's fine and works great.
 For the edge/access setup, I have two /30 interconnecting VLANs with OSPF interface enabled as P2P. On our current network, this is how we do it with RIP. I then have two default routes, one pointing to the core's SVI on each link for redundancy. It works, but it's slow(ish) to rebuild OSPF routes when one of the links go down.
 An option I had in mind was potentially setting up a VRRP in a /29 for the SVI's and then MLAG'ing the ports on the core, with a static route on the edge to the VRRP address - but it feels like I'm reinventing the wheel somewhat and overcomplicating.
 If you were setting up a new edge/access in your network, how would you do the redundancy which offers the best speed and convergence time?
 Any help/guidance would be much appreciated, thanks. :)

 We are running a 50 employee company and want a VPN solution for travel, allowing for better security on public and hotel wifis.
  
Computers: all Win10 22H2, soon starting W11 upgrade
 On-prem: A office network only, that is barely used (employees are rarly working from office)
 No datacenter or servers
 Microsoft 365 with email, sharepoint, onedrive and the usual
 Some other cloud services too, such as invoicing and time tracking
  
Is configuring a point-to-site VPN i Azure might be overkill and more expensive than necessary?
 If possible, I'd like to avoid purchasing 50 [insert (shady) VENDORNAME] VPN solution licences and deploying those manually.
 Right now, we are instructing our employees to use 4/5G mobile data, and not connect to those public and hotel Wifi networks. This works fine in Europe, but for travels outside the EU, the economics breaks the solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all,
 I've noticed this strange issue a few times over the last couple months. When my users send an email with an attachment internally, Message Trace shows that it grows by roughly 5%, I assume due to encoding and headers. However, when sending outside the org, the growth is more like 50%.
 I've had users send emails to external orgs with an attachment that's ~28MB in size. But by the time it leaves Exchange servers, Message Trace shows that it's sitting at ~38MB. This is above the default size limit of 35, so the messages are then rejected by recipients (and the icing on the cake, the sender doesn't get a bounce back).
 Has anyone else suffered this issue and found solutions or information as to what's going on?

He went into work and an hour later was told and locked out of the offices etc. Now, my friend was the sole point of contact for MFA for all the company's clients admin accounts in various portals/admin centres,, be it via authenticator app or mobile number and we were discussing what happens now if he is contacted regarding access to clients. 
 He's saying if contacted he will pass on the info at a charge ad he doesn't work for free. I think he will have to just pass them on or face a legal challenge or withholdal of redundancy pay or potentially Microsoft will unlock the accounts based on the company closing. 
 Anyone had this scenario play out?

I kinda miss when everything was just VGA and you didn't have to go hunting for adapters every time you want to plug a PC into a monitor. I'm sure there are advantages to all these new connectors, but simplicity ain't one of them.

 I am familiarised with MPLS VPLS, VPN-2-VPN or even VXLAN. We are not thinking of using MPLS as it would include ISP costs, so in this case what is the best way to connect our users, iot devices, cameras and smart devices which they are on their own vlan on campus to the servers on the data center? I am trying to avoid l3 connectivity between both, although the underlay network is l3.

The Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to warn vendors, designers, and developers of web applications and organizations using web applications about insecure direct object reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities. IDOR vulnerabilities are access control vulnerabilities enabling malicious actors to modify or delete data or access sensitive data by issuing requests to a website or a web application programming interface (API) specifying the user identifier of other, valid users.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was hired last year to be the principal engineer over a local on prem env along with cloud engineer duties. The on prem really is a simple env and doesn't take much time but internal Infra does fall under it. They needed a dedicated person to "run point". 
 We have an MSP they've used for years and they are really good most of the time. Their head engineer passed away. He was who I worked with most.
 My boss and the CTO want to roll out Intune since we're 365 and our licenses are right. 
 I'm in the very early stages of building policies and testing them. They want the initial policies simple and aimed at mobile devices. So IOS and Android.
 I created an Android policy, tested it on my phone, and made notes.
 I went to create a Conditional Access Policy and didn't have the rights. So I reached out to ask for them. 
 The engineer called me and made me second guess myself. He wanted to knkw why I needed a conditional access policy and not just a device policy.
 And I still don't understand the question or logic behind it. Because if I create Device Policies but not Conditional Access Policy - there would be nothing in place to force people to enroll their devices. The device policies would be pointless.
 Maybe he didn't understand I was testing. But I said the word testing multiple times.
 Am I nuts? I need a Conditional access Polocy or it's all moot, correct?
 If I want to not allow users to be able to use say 365 apps on their phone unless their device is enrolled and compliant - I need a conditional access policy forcing them to enroll their device.
 I think I'm just fried for the day and need to take off early and reset. Because this seems like a no brainer to me.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[To keep this brief, I got into the IT field in 2021. My first job was working alongside the IT Manager as a two-man team. I was able to learn a lot within that year, but after he left the company, I felt like I started to stagnate. The management was also god-awful, and wanted to get out ASAP. 
 I left the company earlier this year and got a job as desktop support that pays me almost double what I was making at the old place. I feel I'm making much more than what is typical for this kind of position, especially considering I'm doing far less than I was at my previous job. 
 I'm happy about getting a livable wage, but it feels like I'm hurting myself more in the long run by taking the de facto "demotion". Nothing I've done in the past month or so of being here is something I couldn't teach my mom how to do in a few hours. 
 Any thoughts regarding this? 
 TL;DR: I'm making more money, but feel like I'm wasting time not increasing the value of my resume.

I'm not necessarily talking about just for one system, because that can be put in the systems documentation. I'm referring to like, bigger issues related to ALL HP printers with a certain firmware / model, or maybe a new Windows bug like AppReadiness slowing logins. It doesn't affect everyone but maybe it should be noted somewhere in case someone runs into this issue or maybe it should be posted because it needs someone to keep an eye on it, like in the case of a 'laravel.log' growing to be way to big, which might require someone to manually move that file(s) elsewhere.
 Just wondering. We don't have a place for 'just so you're aware' and I don't know what to do with some info that might be useful to some other techs. Think like a bulletin board with notes or papers on it with information

Usually a period of time where they were 1st exposed to Systems and Servers, and had to prove themselves to their seasoned coworkers, either enduring hellish On Call rotations, or having to perform the most mundane and boring tasks before being allowed to take on resposibilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We rolled out Confluence at work a few years ago. As much as I despise the app (as compared to other wikis), I like the idea of one company-wide IT central point of knowledge. We're a large Enterprise IT shop and there are lots of teams I need to interact with, each with their own procedures and methods of engagement. With each one having their own Confluence space, I now go to one place to search for documentation.
 But no one seems to understand the concept of a wiki. In a wiki you LINK TO OTHER PAGES. So, when you're trying to document the process you go to to build a new Azure VM, you should link to the Azure provisioning team, and not create your own documentation. Cause whatever you have might be out of date very quickly.
 So, now I go to Confluence and search "provision Azure SLES VM" and I get 20 different pages that come up, some defining of procedure that went out of date 2 YEARS AGO.
 I went through my teams Wiki and removed any documentation that didn't involve something my team does, and replaced it with links to documentation from the team that does that work. And everyone got mad at me.
 I give up.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a Cisco 9200. I am totally lost and left wondering what I could be doing wrong. 
 The switch has a few VLANS and those VLANS have SVIs acting as default gateways for clients in those VLANS. There is also a routed port on the Cisco switch that is connected directly to another layer 3 switch. 
 For reference the routed port on the Cisco switch is 10.17.6.252. The IP of the port it’s connecting to on the other layer 3 switch is 10.17.6.253. The Cisco switch can ping .253. 
 All the clients off of the VLAN SVIs are able to ping the routed port on the Cisco .252 but are unable to reach .253. I am needing clients in the VLANS to be able to reach .253. 
 I have set up static routes…
 ip route 10.17.6.253 255.255.255.255 Gi1/0/9 
 ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.17.6.253
 Gi1/0/9 is the routed port on the Cisco that’s directly connected to the .253 port on the other layer 3 switch. 
 Is there something simple I am missing? I am not understanding why .253 is reachable from the switch itself, but not from any clients connected to the switch. Did I mess up my routes or is there something else? 
 Thanks for any help you can offer.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Today is the second time this happens to me and I am not really sure why.
 We had a remote device connected to our core network that went down due an electrical issue. When that issue was solved, we could see the interfaces became up but there was still no IP connectivity between the remote router and core router, no ping between them and, consequently, no BGP session. 
 I tried resetting the BGP, doing shut/no shut to port at core end but the issue was remaining. 
 We have CDP disable due internal policies, but I enabled it to see if the devices were seeing each other at L2 and, suddenly, connectivity was recovered and BGP session became up. 
 I guess when I enabled CDP, traffic was generated through the interface and remote MAC learnt (I did not check MAC address table prior enabling CDP), but I don't really know why it needed to generate traffic to learn it.
 The other thing I could see during the issue was BGP state toggling between Active and Idle. 
 This is the second time something similar happens to me, the other time was during a migration from an old core router to a newer one, when connected to the new core there was no IP connectivity until CDP was enable.
 Does anyone have an idea of what could be the reason I needed to enable CDP to provide IP connectivity between the devices? 
 Thanks in advance for reading.

 This setup stays for around 3 days. The strange thing is that sometimes, not really regularly, the switches tend to either don’t get link from the previous one, or loose the link to the next one. My quick solution is to restart the switches which always works. But it’s annoying because sometimes it’s more of them so my daily morning routine often is to go to all of them and restart them. 
 My question now is, what can cause this? I know 6 switches in a row is a nono but there is no way around. It sadly has to be like this. Can it be the switches caching too much data or what could it be? 
 Thanks for the help if someone can help and have a nice day.

 The company I work for has a HA firewall setup and has two ISP with a main ISP (router A) and a secondary ISP (router B)
 I was doing a fail over test yesterday and it did not fail over properly to router B. There was no internet. So I started troubleshooting.
 I plugged a laptop up the the secondary firewall and still nothing. I plug the laptop into router B directly and it was working with no issue, mind you DHCP is on. I ran tracert to see if I am getting out and I am. 
 I look on ip chicken to grab my ip and this is where I’m confused. While still plugged into router B, My public ip is the same as the gateway address my ISP has given me.
 At this point I try to put the information from my ISP as static, when I do that it seems like it works for a bit then it just stops working. I swap to DHCP and it start working again.
 I’ve contacted my ISP and they were no help telling me everything I already knew. Such as what my ip, gateway address and subnet is.
 Supposedly per the ISP our ip is 54.82.137.233 and our gateway is 54.82.137.234 (obviously this is not ours but it follows the same template, they are both public) and our subnet is 255.255.255.252
 I’ve contacted our fire wall team and once again has confirmed our gate way is 54.82.137.234 but it’s also the public. Last resort I was going to get them to rebuild the interface but I’m still so confused on why the public is also the gateway.
 I need help understanding this. I’ve looked everywhere yet no answers. Mind you we have done failover test before with no issues.
 If there is stuff I need to clarify, let me now but any help is appreciated.

 The tenant I'm working on belongs to a very small Nonprofit organization that benefits from some free Business Premium accounts. Remaining users can have Business Standard licensing.
 Let's assume that I have a mixed environment, where a few users are on Business Premium and others are on Business Standard.
 Security Defaults is enabled at the moment which is useful for many reasons, main one being automatically enforced MFA.
 Now, would I be able to disable Security Defaults and use Conditional Access for everyone? (I mean without any extra cost)
 My objectives:
  
Allow users to still have MFA (either enforced automatically or enabled manually for each user, which I don't mind doing because it's only a few users).
 Be able to send email with one specific account, using a third party web tool that supports SMTP authentication (it's possible according to this article).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Friends,
 Sorry for the lame title - I am not sure how to best summarize this. We have a 10g connection to Equinix fabric using a fabric "Port". Riding across that fabric are multiple "Connections" that are lower bandwidth. Since my layer-2 connection is 10g there is nothing to hold back transmission other than the policer for the fabric Connection. Is there anything I should do to policy the outbound traffic before putting it on the Equinix fabric to protect my data? I am sending syslogs across this path, and there is no current option for making those logs use a reliable protocol. Is there anything I can do to prevent or minimize the policer drops from losing those log packets? If TCP it would drop and kick off the whole TCP retry process. Bit since UDP there's just no way. 
 Right now I'm just watching the bandwidth with a 60-second graph and we're not going over 50% of our allocated bandwidth. I'm worried about the unexpected bursts due to some security event and then losing that fidelity. Is there anything I can do to help? Or is just more bandwidth the only answer outside of switching to a log relay with (more) reliable TCP?

Why are we using Azure DevOps and GitHub? We're looking at replacing LogMeIn. We're looking at deploying multiple VPN solutions (wtf?). Is this just how start ups are? There's no rhyme or reason to any of this. Oh, shiny new tool? Let's just abandon what we're using now and have spent 100s of hours setting up!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I applied for an apprenticeship for a small IT company two and a half years ago as a Junior System Administrator. Since this was my first real experience in the IT industry (I did an internship as a Help Desk Technician for another company for a year), I was pretty excited at first, but after a year and a half, I noticed that I spent most of my time troubleshooting common user problems (e.g. resetting domain and/or e-mail passwords, setting up PCs, etc.); there were also times when I did actual System Administrator work (e.g. setting up a firewall, setting up and checking on backup activities, etc.), but those times were extremely rare (even now). I've also noticed a lot of internal problems which were brought up but never fixed can be listed as follows:
 - All of us are forced to use personal phones for work; after bringing such a thing up both my boss and management explicitly told me that if I don't like it, I can always buy a new phone that I can use for work at my own expense.
 - At the same time, both my boss and management adore splurging money on parties and other such things.
 - As soon as work is lightly inconvenient everyone expects me to deal with it.
 - They also expect me to both clean other people's messes AND do my job at the same time.
 - All of the things I've learned so far I've learned on my own (except for a few things).
 - Whenever I try to complain about those problems with my boss or management I'm met with empty promises.
 Should I keep going? Or should I just try to land a new job somewhere else? Right now I'm trying to learn Red Hat Enterprise Linux and I'll probably try to set up a home lab so I can start learning how to manage an IT infrastructure since I'm not learning anything new at my current workplace...

 We have a decent amount of laptops that every patch cycle take hours of work to get our Helpdesk to track down and make sure they are getting updates. Sometimes they will be months behind making it even more of an issues. 
 What I do not want, is a laptop to be away for a while miss a critical update cycle and then join our network. Right now, we make sure devices are removed from the domain after a certain amount of days. I believe its 90 days. 
 But with the way security patches are going, some of these updates are seeming to be more critical and coming faster and waiting 3 months seems like too long. 
 How do you guys handle User accountability to making sure these get proper updates in reasonable time frame? 
 I am starting to consider locking them off the network to force them to call but not sure what a reasonable time for this lockout would be.

 Preferably being able to use one DNS server so everyone could access all the internal services in the main office without additional settings regardless of location. 
 Right now we are using ubiquity solution and it sucks, quite often users can't connect directly, but it could be "fixed" by restarting VPN service. 
 Main office is around 50people and one internet connection around 250Mbps, and branches are around 10-20 people with at most the same internet speed. And branches often use access to the file server in the main office to transfer large amounts of data, so at least 50Mbps is required. 
 Right now I'm looking at cisco 900 and cisco 1000 series, but I would be very glad to get any suggestions from someone more experienced.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Guys
 I've been given a project that was someone else work. the guy left but started half way.
 The design that he came up with was that each switch would have its own layer 2 network. switch 1 vlan 110 (172.21.111.0/24), switch 2 vlan 112 (172.21.112.0/24) and so on.
 This can get a bit tedious to manage but my manager said in bigger networks this is the way we do things. 
 All SVI's will terminate to the core switch and then hit the transit network out the ASA.
 One of my colleagues has suggested just spanning a /23 subnet across all switches as this will be simpler to configure and manage. 
 I think that i need a mixure of both. Group switches in group of 4, one vlan for each group of 4 switches. Group 1, vlan 110 (172.21.111.0/24) group 2 (172.21.112.0/24). SVI's will still terminate to the core and then using the transit VLAN bounce out to the internet.
 What do you guys think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Don't ask me why I am doing this haha but I am trying to setup a lab for a production environment.
 I have an older 2 Port Cisco 1800 router, inside interface 192.168.2.1, outside interface 172.16.1.100. The Outside interface is connected to a Hotspot with an ethernet port configured for IP passthrough. The hotspot is connected to my outside interface of the cisco router, the hotspot IP address is 172.16.1.1 which is my cisco routers gateway. I also have a switch connected to the ciscos inside interface which that switch interface is 192.168.2.2. From the cisco router I CAN ping internet addresses through the hotspot. This is because the source is the 172.x network. When I source the ping from the inside interface, 192.x network I get no replies. From my switch I can ping the outside interface of the router, 172.x but obviously not the Hotspot gateway of 172.16.1.1. I was thinking I needed to setup NAT on my router so I setup an access list to permit all traffic, setup nat inside source to the outside interface and configured the 2 ethernet ports from inside/outside natting. Not luck.
 I"m sure this sounds confusing but any help would be appreciated. It's probably something simple I am missing. I just can't ping from the 192.x network to the 172.x gateway on the hotspot. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a question how you would implement the following:
 We are part of a large corporation and communication to the internet goes first through our own firewall that does segmentation (FortiGate 201F) only and then through the big coperation firewall.
 This is at least for our internal clients.
 Dual, we still have a DSL internet connection+router with no special firewall.
 This connection provides internet for visitors or special purposes like EC-card readers, which would not work properly through the big cooperation firewall.
 These two networks are separated by vlans.
 Normal Clients:
 Client -> Switch -> Core Switch -> Own firewall for segmentation (FortiGate 201F) -> Coperate firewall -> Internet.
 Would it now make more sense to configure a Vlan directly connected to the DSL router (which then also handles DHCP) and distribute it to the other switches:
 Zero Trust Client -> Switch -> Core Switch -> DSL Router -> Internet
 ... or connect the DSL router to our own segmentation firewall FortiGate 201F, which then provide the DHCP service and forwards it to the DSL router as next hop?
 Zero Trust client -> Switch -> Core Switch -> own firewall for segmentation (FortiGate 201F) -> DSL Router -> Internet
 The thing is, this DSL internet is not only for visitors but also for our own EC-card readers, so I would like to segment them extra, either on the dsl router or the firewall.
 And I don't know, if a simple home router will keep up with +200 leases at the same time and so on.

 looking into getting this switch it mentions uplink of 10g for the sfp ports but little confused on what the speeds are for downlink between the 4 10gb sfp ports?
 Does this mean its going to be capped at 2.5gb since thats what the main ports are capped at? or is it 10gb both ways for all sfp ports and capped at 2.5g down on the main eth ports?
 If someone could confirm or provide clarity that would be awesome as im interested in picking one up depending on what that answer is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all -- thanks in advance for your help.
 I have, in one hand, a repository of several thousand word and pdf documents that are already named and filed in appropriate subfolders, in a semi-consistent format, in windows explorer/onedrive.
 In the other hand, I have about 800 uncategorized files (also word and pdf) that need to be named and filed within this repository.
 I would love to find a tool that would provide any sort of assistance here. Ideally it would look at the existing files' names and contents, and figure out how to automatically name and file the unfiled documents.
 Does anything like this exist? (I would be willing to pay for this tool if needed)
 (I already use a similar Outlook plugin called 'SimplyFile' -- so basically I am looking for a SimplyFile-type program for Windows Explorer/OneDrive)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I need to connect a S-Series switch to a N1500 using a 40Gb breakout cable. I'm more of a server guy that knows a little networking, so not 100% sure on a few things here, and can't seem to find documentation on it.
 I believe I know how to get the S switch into the proper mode. For the QSFP port, "interface breakout 1/1/25 map 10g-4x" should put it into the proper mode.
 But... what do I need to do on the N1500 switch? I'm assuming you have to configure the four 10Gb interfaces in some manner, you can't just plug all four cables in with no additional configuration and have it actually work, right? Do these four 10Gb interfaces need to go into a port group? Or is there other configuration needed to get this link to work?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a C# program that executes some commands that generates a pdf and print it to a printer. The printer is hosted in a print server, so the way I accessed the printer is through my app config. (\\Print Server Name\Printer Name)
 <add key="printServerPrinter" value="\\APPS-UATSVR\NPIFBCC54 (HP LaserJet MFP M430)"/>
 This program works when I run it on visual studio or even when I release it and run it via its .exe file. It has to run during work hours so I added it to Task Scheduler to start it to check something every minute and print when it found something. 
 The problem is if the program is started by the Task Scheduler It couldn't find the printer, it generates a pdf but can't send it to print on the printer since it couldnt find/open it. This is the error logged on a .txt file.
 2023-07-26 06:32:43:751191 Function:Main - Message:The printer named "\\APPS-UATSVR\NPIFBCC54 (HP LaserJet MFP M430)" could not be opened. Error code: 0
 If I start it normally there are no problems, as I have said earlier. I searched around the net but couldn't find an answer and i can't seem to debug this problem. I've tried many ways, changed the printer name, changed the port, change the backslash to forward slash but it still wont work.
 What seems to be the problem? Thank you very much in advance!

 I am playing around on Aruba CX and Nexus 9K switches i eve-ng, where i am trying to seperate the Overlay and underlay networks in seperate VRFs but with loopback route leaking.
 But i cannot think of a good solution of implementation. 
 So. Is this at all possible or am i on a one-man mission running against a giant wall head first ?
 My usually way is have the underlay and overlay in the default VRF the using VRFs for all other stuff.
 But i wanted even more seperation and wanted to try it :-)

I image about 5 computers per week so I was thinking that devoting some time into creating a custom Image and hosting it via PXE would greatly benefit me in the long-run. I do not have very much experience with PXE or creating custom ISO's or Images. Any tips would be great!! We are a windows 10 environment at this time. 
  
What is the best way to clear all the bloatware from the image so I do not have to do it on every computer?
 What is the best way to handle the drivers? I have historically been loading them all individually.
 What is best practices?

 I'm fairly new to this and my manager gave me this task to play with to try and learn.
 So initially I was trying to set this policy to uninstall an application but it looks like all I did was remove the msi from the GPO? All I did was follow a youtube guide. This is an outlook addin/plugin that is made available to download from the network (not forced).
 I went to add the msi back to fix what I initially messed up but how do I find and select the file location when shared drives are not visible. Yes it is mapped and I am connected to the domain. Is there a special syntax to point to the file? 
 It's current location is: S:\folder1\folder2\folder3\filename.msi
 So then my last question is how do I set this to uninstall from user's devices, the easiest method?

 Last week, around the 19th, someone moved more data than usual to our SharePoint server and caused us to go over 100% storage capacity. Management wants to know who and what files/folders caused the issue.
 I'm more interested in some helpful info on how those of you with more experience in this would or do handle such tasks. I don't expect management to sign off on purchasing license(s) for 365 analytics so that is a no-go.
 I did do a Compliance Audit and searched for "File Upload" events on the date range and then used Excel and Pivot Tables to create a graph and identify the user that contributed the most "File Uploads" on that date.
 We are looking for an increase of 100-200 GB above the normal trend in the span of 1-2 days. Yes, I had a one-hour presentation months ago that I spent many nights working on late into the night to make them aware they would hit their SharePoint limit, provided costs and cost projections for staying in the cloud and buying more or getting a NAS and they decided that at 90% full they should be fine because I essentially refused to give them a date when they would reach 100% capacity...

 Since 2015, the server has set unused. Is there possibly anything at all I could use the server for? I have the original OS CD / drivers.
 Thank you

 ​
 Where I work, I need to go to all our different computers in the system and type a few lines of code on each computer (all PCs). This doesn't seem that bad, but we have over 1,000 computers and this has become incredibly repetitive. Is there any way to do something like auto-run on a thumb drive to avoid this mind-numbing typing?
 ​
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looking for some ideas. We're purchasing 50x interactive displays for classrooms. The Android they come with is pretty average, so I'm hoping to repurpose some older windows laptops to sit behind the TVs as an option for teachers to sign into their domain account and access their OneDrive/Office etc.
 The part I'm needing some help with is some ideas about how to make this work. Each TV (laptop) could have 15+ users and storage would fast become an issue. Additionally, teachers can be in 10+ classrooms which makes it annoying to sign into OneDrive /Teams/Office initially on each room.
 Ideally I'd like to have them run as a thin client and remote into a server so storage isn't an issue, OneDrive/Office is logged in etc. I don't have any experience with this though.
 Thoughts on this situation?

 Setting up a new tenant, and I've been told to restrict all teams groups invites internal and external, but allow instant messaging between certain domains.
 I've restricted all the inbound/outbound access and added the specific domains into the Teams admin centre however I am now hitting an issue.
 We will call the tenant I'm working on Tenant A and the external tenant Tenant B.
 Tenant A users cannot be invited to Tenant B nor invite anyone in Tenant B to Teams groups - great.
 Tenant A users can still send/receive Teams meetings to/from Tenant B users - great.
 Tenant A can initiate instant message conversations with Tenant B users - great
 Now we hit the issue, Tenant B users cannot initiate conversations with Tenant A. This is not a Tenant B issue as this tenant is very open. 
 ​
 Any ideas? I looked into the Tenant Restrictions Preview in Entra ID/AzureAD, but allowing Tenant B in there opens up the ability to invite to groups again, which we don't want.

 so I'm sitting at work, and you know how ones workplace evolves over time. So by this time I'm sitting in front of three screens plus open notebook (17 inch). For various reasons I've got one workstation connected to two screens while my notebook gets one extra screen. Additionaly I've got a 65' UHD screen in here as well, for monitoring and the occasional meeting. Some other stuff with screen outputs on my desk as well, not connected permanently but only if needed.
 So as you can guess, things get messy quickly. I was thinking about getting something like this: https://www.purelink.de/en/switcher-matrices/hdmi/3431/4x4-4k-18gbps-hdmi-matrix-with-scaler-and-audio-matrix to switch between the screens because it leaves me with way more flexibility than any standard kvm switch I found, as those either don't come as a matrix switcher or don't do multi screen setups well. Then I might combine that with some kind of USB Switch.
 My question to you guys is, has anyone run something like this? Any recommendations for multi screen, multi PC setups? Happy to hear any thoughts on my setup, also very interested in how everyone else has their desk setup!

The production VLAN is very tight in terms of browsing the web (completely cutoff really) and after the user is done remoting into the production machine and closes the session, he is also completely cutoff from browsing the web. Signing out and back in solves this but I would love to understand the process behind this phenomenon. I tried googling but I guess my keywords could be zoned in.
 I would really appreciate any and all input on this as it's driving the user crazy and thus, us as well.

 I'm using SCVMM to migrate the VMs from our current hypervisors (Hyper-V) to our new Windows Failover Cluster.I have a SAN with 2 volumes configured on it, one is 18TB and the other is 9TB.I've migrated successfully over a dozen of our smaller servers (no more than 200GB) without a problem. Not it's time to move a couple of our large file servers. 
 One of the File Services is about 852GB in size so should happily fit on either of the Cluster Shared Volumes (18TB or 9TB).When I try to migrate the VM to the Cluster it doesn't appear to see the free space on the cluster shared volumes and reports that there is not enough disk space (it looks like it's only looking at the free space on the C: drive).
 Screenshot of Migrate VM Wizard
 How do I get SCVMM to see the 18TB and 9TB worth of space available so I can successfully migrate our file servers to our shiny Windows Failover Cluster that has 27TB of space but wont see it?!
 Thanks.

 Effective October 1, 2023, the Azure grant is now USD2,000.

 There is some advantages of doing this, for example you can use cloudflare public dns as your name server which makes one less thing to maintain your lab environment etc. This domain is also brand and identity neutral.
 It served me well for many years, hope it does the same for the next owner.

 Exchange 365 with a 3rd party filtering service. 
 Email in question arrives at 3rd party filter, passes checks and is passed through for delivery to our exchange server. 
 But, message never arrives. If I run a message trace, it doesn't appear in 365 at all.
 I've got logs from our filter company, they get a status 250 response, and Queued Mail for Delivery. 
 Recipient has mentioned they get an NDR but still waiting to get a copy to analyse.
 Anyone had similar issues? The not appearing in the message trace is odd to me..

 When I say I'm a newbie, that's what I mean. I have zero programming knowledge and I barely know HTML. 
 I'm not looking to learn everything about python in a single book or in a week, I'd rather read something that has a build approach and doesn't try to introduce everything by the time I get to chapter 3. That's how I feel most of the 'youtube' style video playlists I've watch are like...they start with the basics and by the fourth or fifth video they have already thrown in 10 different concepts and I'm still trying to digest what I watches in the first few videos.
 These are the two books I've heard a lot of good things about, but I would like to hear from this sub and hopefully someone who has been in my shoes in terms of 'no programming knowledge' here they are:

I imagine this should be much cheaper for installers to use? My initial concern is repairability - if the cable gets cut or some pairs go bad, is there any saving it like with a typical x strand OS2?
 Is there a generally widely accepted opinion regarding these for runs between closets? I plan on talking to our usual wiring guy when I see him next, but just wanted some opinions from here first.

 We have an Intranet that is ran through an MPLS circuit. I also have an internal network that’s local to our branch location.
 If I have the users remote from the branch, they’re going to come into our WAN-side interface. VPN network will be separate and will be serviced via DHCP on a Cisco switch. Assuming I route between the two networks (VPN network and LAN network) on the firewall, will there need be a NAT Exemption somewhere to make sure my LAN-side traffic doesn’t get NAT’d when trying to communicate with VPN clients?
 Also, is there a preference over SSLVPN versus IPSec? I understand they operate on different levels of the OSI model. Since it’ll be through AnyConnect, I assume we’d need to use IPsec. 
 Thank you, everyone.

 got the task of implementing a small OSPF (Palo/Cisco) in my company and this task arrived with the previous work of consultant and some implementation of a coleague on our cisco side. This previous work consists chunks of cisco configurations for OSPF and I'm trying to understand why he suggests in the configuration to create interface VLANS (SVIs) for OSPF between routers, he used passive default and then enabled OSPF directly on these interfaces (SVIs). My coleague apparently copied these configuration literaly to the actual router. The thing is that we already have /29 networks to route between routers so it looks like that we should be using those to form adjacencies. I'm not sure if he did that be cause he didn't have complete information of our topology (that's possible) or is it something I'm missing that should be done.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, a bright spark at my company ordered the wrong fibre optic couplers. We are trying to convert our profibus to fibre, but here's the kicker. The converter is for MM and the clients fibre run is SM fibre. How this passed the FAT I'll never know, but here we are. 
 There's a few constraints with this, namely the ATEX areas this equipment is in. We used Bartec as they had a full rated assembly for our needs, and was fully certified. Until we noticed the converters were the wrong type. 
 Time is of the essence, and as we need to try and solve this before we demobilise, I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas. Due to the ATEX area, ideally the fix will not be an active one (I.E. The fix cannot require power inputs) as this would likely invalidate the IECex rating, and we're back to square one. 
 The fibre is under 1k in length with a few splices (I'll need to Otdr for exact losses). 
 Would these work?

 Thanks in advance, we have until Friday to solve this one. Deep joy.

 Can I upgrade to the latest 13.0 build directly?

 We don't want Adobe uploading our files to their grubby little cloud, we pay money to Adobe so we can edit PDF files; that's it.

 Looking for some advice as a basic user of stabket (service desk user with no admin rights). 
 I use stablenet daily for my job to check on switches that may have gone down, but would like to know if there is any way as a basic user to dig deeper and see things such as the port a user device is connected to (laptop etc) as the end user's often dont know and any other things that are useful to know as a user with limited knowledge on the system. 
 From what I've read it seems I would need admin access for most ways to identify the ports or be able to download further software requiring admin access. 
 I also use meraki if this has any way of identifying the ports for end devices too.

I told him to stop he's just shifting the liability from the managers to himself and he's not paid to have that liability
 Also stop putting in heroic efforts in general. If you're doing 100 hours of work weekly then management has no idea they are understaffed. Let things fail do what you can do in 40 and go home. Don't have to be a Superman

 In recent days, not only am I noticing an increase in these spam messages, but some are being directly sent (or spoofed) from employee emails confirmed in Exchange message trace, and one that just came through included the subject of another legitimate email in the garbage text in the title.
 This is obviously concerning to me but I don't really know where to go for support. Does anyone have any tips or recommended resources for giving ourselves a basic security audit and making sure all of our SPF/DKIM/DMARC stuff is in order? I've been having people change their passwords as well just in case.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've been dealing an issue where the network performance for users has been extremely poor (1-1.5 Mbps) download speed on 1G ISP uplink.
 Here is the traffic flow underly and overly. 
 Underlay:--- 
 User-----(wireless)------>AP----->L2switch----->WLC----L2switch----->L3 Gw/PANW FW ------->SD-wAN--------->Interent. 
 Overlay:--- 
 User -------(ipsec)--------->L3 Gw/PANW ------->SD-wAN--------->Interent.
 The user overlay does connect PAN-OS firewall via GP client . PAN_OS firewall has VPN gateway configured. I am testing same file download without VPN (GP disable)- The download speed is ~400Mbps which is good but the moment I turn on the VPN (GP on) the speed reduced to hardly ~1-1.5Mbps.
 -To eliminate GP (VPN) issue, I tried the same thing on Wired infra, in both scenarios, with VPN off speed is close to ~400Mbps however with VPN on the speed is ~250Mbps which is good as well considering the overhead of ipsec encryption/deception.
 I am also in hard situation where i am unable to narrow down the issue, if i say wireless is problem then without VPN speed is good, so wireless is fine at the same time if I do VPN testing on Wired infra, VPN gives me expected throughput so I am going into loops where could the problem relies.
 So far I have seen it is combination of Wireless + VPN.
 I was wondering if anyone else has experienced this issue or would have any suggestions. 
 -When the AP is connected to the local network it contacts the controller as expected, picks up the desired config and broadcasts the SSIDs. The issue is that any client connect to the SSID(s) experience awful bandwidth speeds (e.g. 1-1.5Mbps d/l).
 I have verified end to end MTU on interface it is 1500 and for VPN traffic I have setup mss is 1372.
 Any suggestions are greatly appreciated.

 I am about to build a new network and was thinking about building in some redundancy into it. It is a small business network of about 30 devices. 
 I wanted to ask the community if it’s common practice to have multiple firewalls and switches on site just incase one goes down. This is a network for a supermarket and credit card transactions are important source of revenue. I know this may be a dumb question but I want to try to do this the best and most cost efficient way as possible. Thanks for your input ahead of time.

 We are experiencing strange behavior with one of your guests clients. We use a 5520 as foreign controller and a 5508 as guest anchor. The guest uses a vpn in our guest Wi-Fi and he complains over his user experience( e.g. bad video calls) In the DNA Center I see a lot of L3 inter wlan roaming messages alongside deletes and switches from 2,4 to 5 GHz
 So my question is why there are inter wlan roaming messages. I though L3 inter wlan roaming is when a client moves between two aps which are associated to different WLCs? But in my case every ap is associated to the foreign controller. The guest anchor just terminates the guest traffic.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys,
 My MPS company after its revenue wasnt going so well and we dint had any new clients or projects decided to do some mass lay offs.
 They baptized them "temporary lay offs" where its supposed that we are still in the company but we arent paid till a new client or projects comes but it feels more like a lame way to get us laid off without paying back holidays or any compensation package. They ask us to return our equipment like laptop etc and also the ID office card which it doesnt make sense if its supposed to be a temporary lay off. Not to mention that they have closed our email accounts etc.
 So my question is how to handle this? Is there a way that we can still push back for compensation packages or something?
 I guess since they wont pay us anymore the only leverage that we have is not return the equipment and make a scene asking either for a proper lay off with compensation package and paid the untaken holidays or well a real temporary lay off where we keep the equipment till a new client comes?

 We are having issues with Ciena switches and SFPs where the port simply stops working, yet starts working again when we remove and reseat the SFP. Is there a command buried somewhere in SAOS that would allow us to reset or power down the just the one SFP?
 I believe Juniper has a method: "set cmqfx xcvr remove ..." and "set cmqfx xcvr insert ...".
 Thanks all.

 I'm probably going to be too vague in this question, but I'm not sure how to word it. Please ask clarifying questions that may help me :)
 Currently we have a number of VLANs on an HP Procurve switch (router) and it does most of our routing, with a firewall at the edge. There's no sort of Access control -- all the vlans can talk to the other vlans. All the routes for these VLANs are learned routes.
 What the company wants now is to have all traffic run through the firewall so we can more granularly control who accesses what on what port (a nightmare to me, but it is what it is)
 Is there any scenario where I can really test this, or am I looking at a rip and replace of my routing config all in one go? Can I set some sort of routing where I specify a source and next hop? Any way to specify my gateway as the firewall and have it "bypass" the routing on the switch (poorly worded question)?
 ​
 Thanks!

 We are currently running into a rather odd experience inside our Office Network.
 When trying to authenticate to any Microsoft Service, the "Log into your Account" Window just crashes without any error or warning. Since we are forced to use per User-Licenses in our organisation, more and more people loose access to the M365-Dekstop Suite. Other Services that require Microsoft authentication like Teams, Edge Login etc. are unusable as well (besides using the Webbrowser equivalents). 
 This issue seems to be userbased, as I do have instances where it works on the same machine with a different user. It can only be solved by deleting the user profile and creating a fresh one.
 With the help of the "Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant" im able to reproduce this by choosing the "Office & Office Apps" -> "I am unable to sign-in to activate or use Office apps." function.
 Sysinternals "TCPview" tool shows, that all network connections needed for authentication are successfully created.
 Procmon does show a lot of actions during the capture, but I wasn't able to gather any useful information from it yet.
 Any ideas on how to further troubleshoot this?
 Im happy for any input.

 However, Burconix comes with its own password change dialog box that is mainly used by teachers to reset student passwords when they've forgotten them and it's pretty useful as we're a big school (2k students) and having teachers raise a ticket for every password reset would clog up our ticket queue and potentially slow down lessons.
 I don't want to start giving teachers access to AD for obvious reasons so if anyone is able to give me an idea of how create dialogue box of my own or point me towards site/forum that has explanation that would be great.

 I made an oopsie setting up a domain on MS365, a while back and have only gone around to fix it
 When setting up the domain I accidentally put in a capital letter in the domain.
 This wasn't too much of an issue as I then just changed Set-MsolUserPrincipalName to the lowercase version through PS in AD and also changed the SMTP value to all lowercase so when emails are sent out, they are in lowercase.
 It is only in Outlook their mailbox name has firstname.lastname@Mycompany.com
 However, management would like the capital letter to be removed.
 I did explain that when emails are sent out the capital is removed and in the global address book the emails are in lowercase.
 Searching through AD, MS365 Admin and Exchange admin, the only thing that still has the capitals is the domain name in MS365 Admin and User ID in the "Edit Contact Information" section in exchange admin. I assume the User ID in exchange is what's naming the mailbox names in outlook.
 I have since removed the domain and readded the domain in with no capitals, but the users still have the capitals on their mailbox name in outlook and User ID in exchange online.
 Is there any way to change this field in AD users?

 I'm building a Windows Server 2022 with a Linux VM in HyperV. The motherboard of this workstation has 2 NICs, and my idea is to use one card for Linux VM and the other for Windows.
 I have this workstation in a shared work environment, and I don't have access to the network configuration. The sysadmin of the building gave me 2 IP static addresses that differ just for one final number. They share the subnet mask, gateway and DNS.
 In HyperV the Virtual Switch is set as External

 The problem is: if I keep the Windows NIC disabled, the Linux VM will have internet connectivity, but if I activate Windows NIC, the Linux VM will lose internet connectivity.Do you know how can I fix this problem?

 Since Covid, I was highly motivated to change careers to IT and Eventually Cyber-Security. I got 3 certs from CompTIA, Net+. Sec+ and CySA+.
 I thought, that CySA+ would open doors for me by means of landing me an entry level CS job, a mid-level IT job, or at the very least doubling my call back percentage. It has not.
 The next thing that I assumed was holding me back is my lack of degree in IT. I do have a bachelors in another field, Still I signed up for tuiton reimbursement and am working on an AS in IT. In doing so, I then completed A+ and Linux+. However, with family and work obligations, I wont be able to complete my associates for another 2 years, at least. 
 I thought that with my current certifications, and now enrollment in a program, that my resume would stand out. I have sent over 50, and have heard nothing back. 
 One problem is that I can =not go below a certain floor. I live in a very, very expensive market. For reference, fast food employees make 13 an hour here. I bring this up because true entry level IT positions here only pay 17, therefore I cannot accept a true entry level position, unless I continue to work at my current job, which has great benefits but a firm < 6 figure ceiling.

User e-mailed me to say he needed to WFH and access his office PC. We've got a shared RDGW which is used by different clients, but this client aren't on it yet as they are mostly office based. I've recently labbed setting up a RDGW at home, so was quite pleased to get this. 
 I set up CAPs & RAPs and AD Security Groups to point at them, added the PC and the user to the correct AD groups and then added him to the remote desktop users local group on his PC (I know I should do this via GP really, but wanted to get it sorted). Tested with an admin account and it worked. Sent the user a shortcut and it doesn't work.
 Spent several hours going crazy, checking and double checking what I'd set up. Relaxed the CAPs and RAPs to test. Compared it to other clients. Wondering what really obvious thing I've missed. At this point he's given me his AD password, so I test without the gateway from my PC using VPN. It works, but it's not a solution for him as he doesn't have the VPN. Out of desperation I entered his username in pre windows 2000 format and it connected straight away.
 What an earth was going on?

 We were alerted to the succssfull login attempt and then I proceeded to change the account password, revoked all sessions (from the overview page), revoked all mfa sessions (from the authentication methods page). All looked good for a few days - no malicious logins.
 Then all of a sudden, days later, we see a successful attempt again (blocked for other reasons), but successful with first password and then mfa. They still seem to have a token.
 The user did this on their home personal machine - I am wondering if the TA still has access to that laptop and they grabbed a new token when access was restored for the user last week? I can't see any way they still have a valid token.....
 Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi guys, just in the stages of planning new network and during our engagement with various vendors we looked at Aruba and it was mentioned that many users with controller setup now deploy large subnets for wireless clients and it is all ok as long as you control BUM traffic. I believe I saw the Aruba reference design say /16s are fine. I understand this is possible as with a controller you can control the BUM traffic as it ingresses.
 This has me wondering, is there any reason this isn't possible on wired network where you have the ability to apply centralised policy at a switch port level on ingress traffic? I know with Aruba it is technically possible to emulate the wireless setup with wired traffic by tunnelling wired traffic to controllers although we couldn't find any examples of customers doing this. Is it not possible on a traditional wired network where you have a NAC and centralised policy that can be applied at port level to discard BUM traffic there? Or is there something else preventing a move towards larger subnet sizing on wired?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Apologies if this seems ultra basic, but I am looking at testing some features on a router I have - Specifically DPI (Deep Packet Inspection) - What I would like to do is the following:
 Device A - Iperf Server
 Router with DPI running
 Device B - Iperf Client
 What I would like to do is effectively smash the link between Device A and B with as much traffic as I can to test the performance of the router with and without DPI running and compare the two. 
 As stated, the devices will be connected to the appliance locally and within the same subnet - There is an argument of course to testing the forwarding performance and the routing performance, but I'd like to cover the basics first, as far as I can tell, the difference would be simply changing the subnet for 1 device.
 Ideally, once I've set this up, I would like to have it automated such that it runs in the early morning (1-2am) and, something that would be really awesome, compile the results and send it as an attachment to an email.
 Is what I'm hoping to do feasible? Has anyone achieved this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When building EVPN-VXLAN fabrics typically the underlay is used for reachability of loopbacks for VTEPs and BGP peerings. I'm interested if others have experience of or opinions about connecting a subset of servers directly to the underlay, for a kind of hybrid IP + EVPN-VXLAN fabric.
 The use case is where there are a mix of servers which require pure L3, L2VPN and L3VPN connectivity which are connected to a single leaf/spine network. There could be different design options to cater for that, ranging from co-locating those servers on the same leafs, splitting them onto separate leafs with common spines, or splitting them into separate pods.
 The benefit would be having one network fabric servicing all flavours of server, the possibility for incremental upgrades (e.g "upgrading/downgrading" a port from L3 -> VXLAN without having to re-cable it to a new network). 
 Are there downsides to this hybrid approach? Maybe scalability considerations as TCAM has to be optimised for both EVPN-VXLAN and "normal" IP routing? Convergence issues due to bloat in the underlay routing table?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. I'm planning a switch from a current setup of Fortigate SSL VPN + Azure NPS extension for MFA to Azure SSO via SAML. Done the testing, all good, but I have 2 issues. First, I have to somehow "sell" this switch to the client (as in why this is better than the current setup) and what I'm thinking is 1. benefits of conditional access, 2. logs in only one place and 3. availability, if the radius server somehow goes offline it's bye bye ssl vpn for the users right now. Are there any other advantages that I could mention? 
 Secondly, I have to find a way to do this as "silent" as I can so the users are not...bothered. I know I could do a step by step tutorial and let them modify the existing connection profile but this is not an option. Manually doing it myself remotely is also not an option, there are almost 400 users. What I tought about so far was Intune, but this would work only if I push the full Forticlient app, so it would be a reinstall/upgrade, it needs reboot and so on. Also, I thought about just pushing the configuration via gpo, but I have no idea if the Forticlient connection settings are stored in the registry, or in some file. Any better ideas here?
 Thank you! :)

 CVE-2023-20593
 TomsHardware:
  
Tavis Ormandy, a researcher with Google Information Security, posted today about a new vulnerability he independently found in AMD's Zen 2processors. The 'Zenbleed' vulnerability spans the entire Zen 2 product stack, including AMD's EPYC data center (EPYC 7002) processors and the Ryzen 3000/4000/5000 CPUs, allowing the theft of protected information from the CPU, such as encryption keys and user logins. The attack does not require physical access to the computer or server and can even be executed via javascript on a webpage.
 AMD has patches ready for its EPYC 7002 'Rome' processors now, but it will not patch its consumer Zen 2 Ryzen 3000, 4000, and some 5000-series chips until November and December of this year. 
  
AMD:
  
Any performance impact will vary depending on workload and system configuration. AMD is not aware of any known exploit of the described vulnerability outside the research environment.

Currently have fairly poor practise in this area (we have done the textbook "too hard, just grant DA" far too many times) and we're working hard to tighten it up. All the advice I've read goes to varying lengths of paranoia, and I'm wondering how real-world sysadmins are handling it.
 So, r/sysadmin, what are you doing in terms of break-glass procedures for Azure and AD administrative accounts?

 I've been in IT about 7 years now. Been sys admin the past couple years and recently starting learning more with networking. I'm no expert in one thing, been more a jack of all trades kind of guy. Mostly on-prem but some azure and o365.
  
 The big problem is I'm currently making $90k in a MCOL area so I'm probably going to have to find a 100% remote job which would be new to me. Just looking for what job titles I should be searching for. Even open to suggestions to get out of IT if my skills would easily transfer somewhere else.
  
 Appreciate any advice, really been struggling mentally the past couple weeks and I just need to make a change.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[First off, not my area of expertise, so thanks for any help.
 I implement web-based automation systems, basically server software that runs on a Windows based computer, and users access the interface via a webpage. They're typically setup on a customer's network and they handle all the remote access, but I frequently start systems before their network is in place and having remote access is a great time saver.
 I have been using Cradlepoint with their Netcloud Perimeter VPN which was perfect. Now that they've deprecated that option, I'm losing my simple to use system. So, I figured I'd setup a port forward like I've done before with systems that use something like spectrum business class ISP. Now after some research into why it didn't work, I'm finding that the cell service I have isn't using publicly routed IPs.
 I've tried the IOT Advanced subscription option from Cradlepoint, but it's painfully slow and not at all easy to use. Do I have any options to get some sort of inexpensive VPN option similar to what was included with the Cradlepoint Netcloud subscription? Thanks again for any help, or suggestions on a better place to ask this question.

For example, if I have a device (2.41.10.10,255.255.0.0) on VLAN 41 (2.41.0.1) that allowed me to monitor it by accessing a web browser, and I wanted to be able to access that web browser from a device (2.11.1.x) on VLAN 11 (2.11.0.1)? How does this change if one device is on VLAN 11 (2.11.0.1) on switch A and the device hosting the web browser is in VLAN 41 (2.41.0.2) on switch B, with a trunk between the two? Both switches are running Cisco OS. I’ve tried messing with static routes a bit, but have had little luck and I’m struggling to understand the routing required, but I’m sure it’ll click with a bit of help. TIA!

Dell has repeatedly failed to communicate and has dropped the ball on providing their end of a support plan purchased with a server not even a month old.
 We are not even getting replies from dell. It has been over 72 hours now... We have called, emailed, and are now replacing this brand new server because we have zero confidence this will be resolved timely.
 Anyone have any suggestions? 
 Update: 7-24-23 -8pm cst
 Dell made us aware late Monday (today) that the part is not available in any warehouse in the US. We had to call and email everyone at Dell to get them to tell us this. 
 We were told they would get back to us with alternative options, different better card, whole new server, something... "soon." We have not heard back yet today. Tomorrow may be more promising and redeeming of them.
 It is a Perc raid card running an array of SSDs that they cant source. As a brand new server of the latest generation, I can only assume its because its so "new" they dont have extras on hand... the worse scenario, is that the cards are failing so fast, they dont have any to fill our warranty request :O

How in the world can Microsoft let a threat actor get their hands on MSA keys to "forge tokens and access OWA and Outlook on line" Are you fucking kidding me? And what's worse, we're just supposed to brush it off like it's no big deal? It's been almost two weeks, and there are still no new updates to the KB on this issue.
 To top it off, there's this wiz blog claiming they could have gained full access to Azure and O365! I'm beyond frustrated that Microsoft hasn't made any public statement about this; You can't make one public statement saying that they didn't have access? If you open sourced any of this, we would be able to tell ourselves.... But because understanding the Azure AD token cycle is just a piece of cake for everyone on this planet, except for me and the rest of the fucking IT people in the world who don't have 6 months to go thru Azure token training, I have to sit here and fucking guess.
 I mean, who needs straightforward explanations when you can have a delightful puzzle-solving experience trying to figure out their convoluted jargon and mind-bending concepts.
 Good luck trying to google Storm-0558, You will get 800 AI news stories on it. This one is painful.

 Since sdwan is doing it intelligently and the user traffic is no longer visible on the MPLS interface, I think this is no longer necessary. What would be the appropriate course of action in this case? Should I simply apply shaping at the transport level to smoothen the traffic flow?
 I'm currently noticing many output drops on CE router MPLS interface, and my client has this policing in place.
 Btw, the setup is SDWAN device -> CE Router -> MPLS.

 When someone, usually non-IT, is pushing for some wireless gizmo, I take the stance of 'always wired, unless there is absolutely no other choice' Because obviously, difficult to troubleshoot/isolate, cable is so much more reliable, see history, etc
 Exceptions are: remote users, internal workers whose work takes them all over the campus. I have pushed back hard against cameras, fixed-in-place Internet of Thingies, intercoms
 When I make an exception, I usually try to build in a statement/policy that includes 'no calls during non-business hours' if it goes down.
 I work in an isolated environment and don't keep up with IT trends much, so I like to sanity check once in awhile, am I being unreasonable? Are you all excepting of wireless hen there is a wired option? It seems like lots of times the implementer just wants it because it is more 'cool'.
 It is just really tiresome because these implementers and vendors are like "Well MOST of our customers like wireless..." I am getting old, and tired of fighting..

 https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/157ofsf/managers_directors_would_you_fire_me_over_this/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1
 There were a couple of asshats, but only like two. Anyway, I couldn’t really sleep last night and I spoke to my boss this morning. 
 First thing he said was that he thought it was going to be worse, lol. He also said that when I’m gone for a week, he forgets to check Mimecast or when I’m not in on Fridays, and that it’s not completely my fault as he never even warned me about the 48 hour thing when he showed me the system. Anyway, I think part of it was probs trying to make me feel better but I took full accountability for it, as I said that I would. He said it isn’t a massive issue, and we just talked about how I was going to sort it going forward.
 I spoke to the SS, and she was like “Righttttt…” but basically said that she’s not going to feather and tar me and thanked me when I said that I had sorted it going forward. I did apologise as I am responsible for Mimecast.
 Anyway, I still have a job and the held queue is clear.
 Thank you all for commenting. At this stage, I’m not comfortable with allowing users to release their own emails as I don’t trust that they won’t end up being stupid about it, but I will look at potentially revising the current process in place.
 I still feel a bit icky about it all, but at the end of the day, I didn’t know about it before as it hadn’t been raised. The sales supervisor said that at least now we know and it’s good that we know, which I agreed with, as it means that we can stop this going forward.
 One day, when I’m older than 22, and maybe when I’m a manager myself, I will remember this and tell my juniors about it, lol.
 This is by far my biggest fuckup in 3 years, but I think I’m going to be okay… fingers crossed!

 In the past Id run into, "Okay, please try again." And they'll say, "I already have." And I say, "Right, please test now..."
 So I have developed saying something like the following but a bit nicer to save time and set a baseline all in one.
  
Fixed at 13:45. Any attempt before 13:45 will have not worked. If you haven't tested after 13:45, please do so."
  
This gives me a baseline and always sets a timestamp of when it was fixed.
 Another thing -
 We're all adults. I shouldn't have to tell you, "Okay. It's Friday morning. If you dont get this to me by a reasonable time to look at, that customer may have to wait all weekend for a fix." That's on you to work the logistics out. Even if I feel bad for customer. If I get in the middle, I'm stuck in the middle. And I don't have time to do two jobs.
 There is this woman over support who doesn't do the base work. Friday I asked her how to replicate. She says we'll have to replicate the customer env in the testing env." And time stood still and I stared at my screen thinking, "Why didn't you do that before escalating to me? You mean you haven't tried to replicate the issue?"
 So I push back and tell her to let me know know when she has copied their setup to our testing env. She waited until Saturday to do it. Then first thing Monday morning asks, "Were you able to determine the issue with .." 
 I've been online an hour, Susan. It's Monday. You didn't give me what I needed until Saturday.
 I need tea.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I'm troubleshooting a point to point link connecting two data centers. It's 10gig, but deployed by a provider who packetizes, so it does not behave like a traditional 10gig wave / private line which just repeats light. This means you can usually get up to several gigabits on a single TCP stream, but need more streams to fully utilize the circuit. There's about 50ms of latency between locations due to geography. 
 The issue we're having is TCP performance is mostly horrible, but sometimes goes back to near normal. Using iperf, if I test between two nodes on the same layer two vlan that's bridged across this link, sometimes I'll see possibly close to 2 gbps, as low as 100 Mbit/sec, but typically averaging out in the sub-600 Mbit/sec range. Watching the linux tcp counters, I can see numerous retransmits, timeouts, backoffs, etc. So, clearly the circuit is dropping packets. 
 If I switch to UDP and vary the send rate, 1Gbps or lower gets me 0.068% packet loss, 2Gbps 0.3%, 2.5Gbps 0.89%, 3 Gbps and we're into the 1.1%+ range with spikes as high as 6%. 
 The end to end setup had been working fine for half a year and then on a specific day began this behavior.
 Has anyone ever seen a transceiver issue cause behavior like this? My experience has been those will have light issues and/or affect all traffic types. Light is strong in both directions. They also tend to go from working to failing, not something in between. In contrast, I've routinely seen this kind of issue affect circuits when there is an overloaded node in the path, an incorrectly configured QoS or rate limit config somewhere, etc. The transit provider assures me none of that is in place nor any overloaded or failing links in the path.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I know in factory work they have a six-sigma or 5S standard initiatives that are used to help improve different processes and help them run better and cut waste. I am wondering if there is any kind of service or partnership known in IT that helps go through a company's support model and help with workflow, budgets, staffing, and basic day to day operations to find areas where we can improve.
 Our current IT department I feel is not utilized well, everyone wears multiple hats, everyone is on live phones, many processes don't have good documentation, or ticketing system and asset tracking is a mess, and I feel like we are spending way too much on services and tools we don't need. I am wondering about finding and suggesting an outside consulting company to our leadership that can take an unbiased look at how we are operating and our workflow and suggest how we can restructure to improve.
 It is very stressful at my job a lot of times because we don't have good structure in place, I feel every day I am just showing up and opening a mixed bag of whatever is a priority for that day and never having time to schedule or work on projects, aside from small pockets of time here and there to spend 30 minutes or so on something randomly during a week. It's a mess. But as much as I try to improve and document and organize what I am working on randomly over time, the department as a whole is pretty scrambled. If we had an expert consultant come on site and give some recommendations, I think it would be a good way to put us on track.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I manage a large network with many sites.
 A rough estimate would be about 40-50 switches (most of them 48 port witb 4x fiber ports) in total - maybe more.
 And at the moment some of them are ancient HP/Aruba switches, some are a bit younger.
 All without SDN, for each port I have to go to this horrible interface of the respective switch.
 In addition, there are physically separate LAN and VoIP (so no Vlans).
 I want to kick all of this out.
 Which manufacturer would you recommend me?
 I already know ubiquiti with OnPremise Controller, that I found actually quite good, but no idea whether the manufacturer is suitable for such an enterprise network. 
 As a criterion:
 SDN - preferably with low running costs! Rather OnPrem controller than cloud.
 Fast configuration, understandable QoS settings for the future Vlan separation between Lan and VoIP.
 The hardware should not be as expensive as gold, yet offer a certain degree of durability. (Like not be eol after 2 years)
 Any suggestions?

 Now before I begin I am definitely not a network engineer and won't be implementing this I am just trying to make sure I am grasping the concept right so I would appreciate any tips and or guidance on this.. sorry if it is painfully wrong :) 
 https://imgur.com/a/6ZtiPZ1
 This is a quick diagram I did to hopefully show things better, the network is a true HA setup and will be air gapped. Each rack will contain 2 switches as the workstations have dual nics, like I mentioned there is not much info in regards to the configuration as I am just trying to make sure I am understanding the concept correctly before a network engineer starts designing further.
 ​
 Any guidance would be very helpful :) thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey fellow network enthusiasts,
 I'm currently working on setting up a network with redundant ISP links and MikroTik devices for a business set-up, and I could use some expert advice to optimize the configuration. Here's the setup I have in place:
 ISP Redundancy Links: Two ISP links connected to a D-Link switch DGS 1210. Redundancy is vital for uninterrupted connectivity.
 Captive Portal: A MikroTik rb 3011 router configured with a captive portal to manage user authentication and access control.
 Distribution over Fiber SFP: A MikroTik CRS106 1c 5s used for distributing the network over fiber using SFP modules.
 L3 PoE Switch: A Layer 3 PoE switch TL-SG 2210P, which enables efficient power delivery to connected devices.
 Access Point: The network extends to an EAP245 Access Point, providing wireless connectivity.
 If you have experience working with similar setups or expertise with MikroTik devices, your insights and suggestions would be greatly appreciated! I'm open to any ideas that can help me optimize this network setup and make it as efficient as possible.
 Thank you in advance for your valuable assistance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posting on a new account, just looking to get everyones thoughts on this. Tried to post ITCareer subreddit, isn't as active over there.
 Currently Senior IT Systems Manager in a company based in England with 4 regional offices and 20+ branches. Team of 5 including myself.
 1 IT Director
 2 Sys Admin
 1 Trainee Sys Admin
 I currently deal with everything IT related; ERP, CRM, Department Software(HR etc), Network, Infrastructure, Procurement, Asset Management, Support, Setting up Branch's, Mobile/Tablets, 365, SQL/Databases, backup, HyperV, Storage and Programming/Design/Development.
 Basically every IT role you can imagine into one, that is the way IT has always been here.
 I have been here for around 6 years, the 2 Sys Admins 15+ years each and the IT Director 25+ Years. I have been given the opportunity in the next 24 months to takeover the roll of IT Director/Manager with also a chance to have ownership in the company.
 The 2 Sys Admins are very much stuck in their ways reluctant to new tech, struggle to keep up with demand, and very laid back. I am very much holding the IT function together as even the Director has little to no interest as he is retiring.
 I have brought up at our annual reviews the lack of interest and enthusiasm from the Sys Admins I get told they are "getting on" so will struggle and I just need to accept that they will try what they can to make sure they are keeping with the times but that's down to the individuals. I feel like they are just letting them ride it out, and hopefully they will retire in the next 5 years or so.
 These Sys Admins are on £3-4k less than me per year.
 Do I hold out and take the opportunity while still having to do all the tasks/functions above or just start looking for a new position over the next few months?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I think this will be a question for the Wireless guys. Do any of you know of an Android/Apple App that will monitor the Wireless Latency and Packet Loss (1sec interval preferred) of your network? Something that will allow me to ICMP Latency and Packet Loss monitor an IP address wired into the LAN to measure the WLAN Latency/Packet Loss at a site. Ideally this app will also log the AP MAC/SSID/Name that the client is connected to and you will be able to go hey I see our clients are getting a lot of packet loss near Access Point 1 for example. The dream state will allow me to upload a map of the site to the app and then do BLE/Wifi locationing to know exactly where clients are having packet loss issues on the WLAN (I know this is a dream state that probably doesn't exist yet).
 If none of you know of anything paid/free then I guess I will have to build something myself which I really don't want to have to do... I know an Ekahau has Latency/Packet Loss monitoring, but I am after an app we can put on clients and monitor all the time.

 Is there a way to extract the payload using a enterprise Meraki AP? I somehow need access to the payload. Maybe only even the advertisment data.
 Studying their configuration menu they seem to spit out MQTT with frames but they lack of documentation if they add all the payload of what they receive.
 Have somebody of you tried this before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all. My Nessus scans are bringing back servers with 10 or more versions of .net framework that are vulnerable. .net framework does not register in add/remove programs.
 There is a .net framework uninstall tool in a GitHub repo linked from MS, but when I run it, it doesn’t see any versions it can remove.
 In server admin, I can remove 3.5 and 4.5, but there are a ton of other versions listed.
 Anyway, does anyone have any advice for cleaning up old versions of .net framework? At this point I’d even try getting rid of ALL versions and reinstalling the ones I need.
 Or, does anyone know how to uninstall a single version? If I can figure that out I can script the removal of them all.
 Thanks

 I am having issues with my google workspace account from work when used on my personal PC. My personal account works fine. I am using same PC, same Browser, same internet connection for both accounts, yet my google chat, google drive and google calendars from my work account are not working properly. 
 I have tried updating chrome, I've tried using a different browser, I've reset router and PC, I've cleared cookied and cache... It doesn't make any difference. 
 I would understand if google workspace didn't work for all my accounts, but why is it malfunctioning with only one of them?

We're retiring our office over the next few months and we have a chunk (about 12TB) of data on a NAS in our rack here that we need to migrate to our Google Drive shares. We have plenty of storage capacity available in Drive and a solid 500Mbit uplink that's totally unused so no concerns around transfer times or capacity.
 ​
 So far the best option I've found to handle the transfer is this:https://support.google.com/workspacemigrate/answer/9222862
 The requirements are quite daunting - we don't really have much hardware in this office (it's primarily used for video content production) outside of the NAS, and Workspace Migrate requires 3 relatively beefy Windows Servers. 
 Obviously there's the option of just uploading in chunks each day until we hit the upload quota for the accounts we're using - but ideally I'd like to use something a bit more elegant. Does anyone know of any services, scripts, open-source projects etc. that might be helpful here? I've already reached out to a few that I've found (CloudFuze and a couple of others) but would appreicate if anyone has any other suggestions!

 I am looking for some suggestions on how do we better provision servers in our environment. I'll try to explain it as detailed as possible. 
 For example, every admin in our environment creates a server differently in the sense that they dont see the correct settings etc, dont disable weak security encryption etc, its all build in a mess. I don't want to just create a document, but maybe use a tool which has maybe a VM template and can automate all of this. Will something like SCVMM do the job? Or is there something else? 
 SCVMM came to mind because then it also comes with Orchestrator, which we can build to automate the user provisioning etc but again, this is just because i don't know other options.
 The more automation the better, of course not everything can be done in that way. Also we use Azure as well as hyper-v and Vmware.

 I have a strange case at a company where they use a Mitel MiVoice Business (Release level: 8.0 SP3 PR2) and each time User A (Alexa) calls User B (Bruno) it shows the right name. But in the Missed, Outgoing and Received Calls lists it always shows the name of a former user C (Chris).
 The way we put the extension in place was we removed the old extension entry to set it up from scratch. Factory formated the phone (Mitel 5312) and now it still shows in those histories with the wrong name.
 There even is the same issue with just a contact of a phone directory entry. We give some people a company mobile phone and one of those phones changed hands to a new person (Jane Goodall). So when that person calls it always displays the name of the former user (Sandra Bullock). The only place I know where to look for is under "Users and Devices" > "Telephone Directory Management" > "Telephone Directory".
 There is no more entry even remotely having the former user's name and it somehow still stays in the system. Does anyone have an idea on this?
 Edit:
 No personal entries were created on any of the affected phones

We have several protected computers VM and physical machines and everything works great. I have been tasked to setup a new server with windows server 2019 standard and add the server to the DPM. Whenever i try to install the protection agent through the DPM Administrator console this error comes up. 
 Error 402: When trying to retrieve information from the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service on testSERVER.example.local, access was denied. 
 I'm using Domain Admin credentials btw.The second thing i tried was installing the agent manually via cmd as administrator. This was a success and it also added some firewall exceptions. Having installed the agent manually i tried attaching it but i had the same exact error 402. 
 Now i tried installing the agent manually on a windows 10 pro machine and as soon as i installed the agent manually the computer popped up on the management section no problem. I'm thinking there may be some compatibility problem with the version of DPM. If anyone can help me it will be much appreciated as I’m at a loss.

 Is it possible to do this without logging into Windows? Is there a smart shortcut from the login screen that I'm unaware of? I know of Windows + P to set it to extend the monitors instead of duplicating.
 I could log in with my own account or administrator account to do so, but then I have to wait for the login, have my user profile created on the users laptop, and then finally it also would show it as the default user on the laptop, when the employee wants to log in for the first time.
 How do you deal with it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, This might be an odd request. I'm looking to see if there are any tools out there that might take a single TCP flow between two hosts and split it up into several flows over an ECMP WAN and then recombine at the other end (induced latency is OK for this requirement.) I have many 1Gb/s paths between two points but I have some elephant flows that are stuck on a single path for a long time. I'm struggling with my google-fu figuring out what to search for, I'd guess its going to be pretty niche if it exists at all. I'm looking to to treat traffic after it leaves the source as the source is an appliance I can't modify. I can't replace the 1Gb/s paths with faster paths unfortunately.

 I currently have FolderRedirect in use.
 I have enabled in the GPO that the start menu and some other folders should also be stored there.I would like to undo this for some folders now that it is stored in the "normal" profile.
 Is there any way I can get the contents of the folders back into the user profile? As far as I know, these folders are then empty in the profile, or in the old state.
 Does anyone have an idea what I can do? Or is there only the solution to copy the files and contents manually or with a script?
 Thanks
 EDIT: I'm not sure, that i had enabled the option "redirect the folder back", before i enabled FolderRedirect.
 Is there any way I can see what settings FolderRedirect used to create the folders?

 But the 1% remaining Im tasked with doing the rest. ~400 computers. First I need to find out what PC is currently using what license(generic or digital) then update all the generic ones. Our remote software has this information but doesn't have the ability to export the product key in the csv
 Does anyone have any suggestions on how I could do this in bulk ?

 This does not work for us in any EXO v3 module (v3.0.0 - v3.2.0). If we instead use a v2 module (2.0.5), it still works. The experience is that after you press <Enter> in v3, nothing happens other than the cursor drops to a new line. The only way to terminate the cmdlet is to close the PowerShell session. In v2, you receive the "are you sure" prompt.
 Anyone else experiencing this issue? If not, I'll be suspicious of our conditional access policy for REST clients, but no other cmdlet is affected that we know of.

 Managing our service operationally has become a little hectic and we've been slapped on the wrist a few times for missing SLAs recently. Our director end of last week gave us hints about how the current process of 1 on-call engineer having to manage all 80 production deployments is getting a little crazy and that our MTTR (minimum time to response) is way too high... 
 Eventually... he proposed we start automating some stuff such as root cause analysis/canary analysis/early anomaly detection - especially with the new AI buzz, and as a lead engineer asked me to look into it.
 Anyone have experience dealing with this kinda situation? I wonder if there's a way the MTTR can be reduced using processes. Maybe better training with the remaining members of my team? or even like using PagerDuty better? Or any service that helps solve this?
 I'm pretty frustrated atm cuz i already have enough sht to do. I don't think this is gonna solve anything. If we end up working on this I'm going to quit.

This person was the bearer of all secrets basically, so nothing seems to be "typical" and I have had the joy of problem solving all of this the past few months, reverse engineering the pieces of you will. 
 Last week we had an issue with our Juniper SRX340 Firewall at one of the buildings. The power light is green, yet the "STAT" light is solid amber. I am trying to get into the device to troubleshoot. But i am blocked getting to it from the server (obviously) and connecting to the management port does not seem to do anything. The guide on Junipers website shows "figures" for ports our SRX340 does not have. 
 Can someone please tell me how to connect to the SRX340 to check what the error is? My thought is the device isn't fully booting, and that's why I'm unable to manage/access any "normal" way. But thought I would ask in case I'm missing something, regarding how to manage/access the device to check why the "STAT" light is amber! 
 P.S. I let it boot for about 45 minutes and it would randomly (at no obvious intervals, as I was timing the power up) the fan would kick on into high speed, and the "STAT" light would turn green for about 5 seconds, and then back to Amber. Also, if I can find a backup of the device, how would I restore it?

I also realize it's not as simple or guaranteed to magically get the NEC of my choosing, but to say I am not at least a little bit curious is a lie. 
 The Cybersecurity career path requires a BS in Computer Science, pays almost twice as much as the IT position, and is an office job in the country.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi folks, 
 I am running an Ethernet over GRE tunnel in a test environment and have a couple questions:
 This lab setup has four VyOS routers with MTU set at 1538.
 SRC -> R1 (source of GRE tunnel) -> R2 -> R3 -> R4 (destination of EoGRE tunnel) -> DST
 SRC is physically plugged into R1.
 DST is physically plugged into R4.
 Intermediate links are ethernet or AirFiber AF5XHD (MTU = jumbo frames)
 Reading the config file on the airfibers shows:
 ame.net.jumbo=enabled
 netconf.4.mtu=1538
 netconf.3.mtu=1538
 netconf.2.mtu=1538
 netconf.1.mtu=1538
 I can ping and run traffic normally between SRC and DST.
 However, when I run a traceroute, I still show intermediate hops, which doesn’t make sense, since the GRE tunnel starts at R1 and ends at R4, and should act as a transparent wire, correct?
 When this happened with MTU 1500, I changed all intermediate links to 1538 and routers to 1538 MTU, and rebooted everything. Do I need to change MTU to something even higher? Are the MTU settings what are causing these intermediate hops to show up?
 traceroute to 172.18.2.54 (172.18.2.54), 30 hops max, 38 byte packets
 1 * * *
 2 * * *
 3 172.18.2.54 (172.18.2.54) 12.438 ms 9.779 ms 9.727 ms

 Our label maker recently broke and before I go ahead and replace it with what we’ve got, I’d be curious what you have used and liked.
 We’ve had a Dymo Rhino 4200 for the last decade+. I would not call us a heavy use case. We use it to label various hardware in our racks - routers, firewalls, switches. Along with cables - flags for fiber, wrap around for power and Ethernet.
 The device we have gets the job done, but there are times for those larger projects it would be nice to have the ability to feed in some data when we have to create 50+ labels rather than type them all manually into the Dymo.
 What have you used and been pleased with?

I’m looking for some advice for securing some sort of sys admin role in that specific job market, as well as any other direction in becoming an admin in general.
 I have a year and a half of experience working on a tier one help desk for a large company, which became tedious and somewhat boring when each interesting ticket I came across had to be escalated to other teams. I then moved to the current MSP to gain some real hands on experience, which I most definitely have, wearing multiple hats every day since we’re such a tiny team. In the additional year and a half here, I believe I have a solid grasp of the fundamentals working with firewalls, servers, O365, Azure etc daily. 
 I have no certifications currently but, working through CCNA and Azure 104 to not only get them under my belt, but to start filling in all the little knowledge holes I may have from jumping in to the deep in and learning to swim as I went along.
 Anyway, I’m mostly looking to hear from folks that work or have worked in the city, especially any quirks related to landing a job, living and working there, or maybe any mistakes you made along your way. I’m just a 3 year old IT baby, but I’m convinced it’s possible to make it happen for myself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Every SaaS provider and their dog want to send/receive emails in 365 via OAuth using application permissions since basic authentication has been deprecated. Whether they are fancy/smart enough to publish their own "Azure App" or they want you to register one in your AAD tenant.
 There are at least 2 ways to access/send emails via:
  
GraphAPI - via Mail.[Some action] application permissions
 Office 365 Exchange Online API - IMAP/SMTP/POP.AccessAsApp (doc here)
  
What freaks me out is giving "Admin consent" to these apps. Does this mean they get to use these permissions on ALL of our users? Its the kind of thing that does not let me sleep at night.
 From RTFMin a bit I've come to the conclusion - please confirm or correct me:
  
if application permission is via GraphAPI - yes, the Mail.* permissions are given to the app on ALL mailboxes in the org. You HAVE to use ApplicationAccessPolicy to limit the app's access (doc here).
 1. if application permission is via 1. Office 365 Exchange Online API - no, there needs to be an explicit Exchange Service Principal and that be assigned mailbox permissions (as implied in the doc here). Tested with the test tool mentioned in this blog (used temporary secret)
  
If I got that correct, now my questions is - are there other APIs that mail? How - as an admin - am I supposed to know and VERIFY the level of permissions granting admin consent will provide this app? Am I missing something in my Azure App/SP understanding and it supposed to be obvious?
 If you there is a better place for such a question than please also do point me there (I see a lot of technical questions downvoted here stating that there are better and more specific subs).

 I have recently resigned and serving my notice period. Due to this I don't get a lot of work or any work for that matter.
 So recently, I have been working on a research paper and downloaded it from my Linkedin account. I worked on it and then when I was sending it back (on Linkedin) a Forcepoint DLP popup came up saying "Confidential Data detected" There was a user override option stating "This is my personal data, and doesn't contain "Company's" confidential information." I selected that, and sent the same.
 Now I am worried that I will be in trouble. Just to be sure, there is no confidential information in the paper, all the information is publically available and is referenced properly. I work in a legal role, so we regularly get such research papers for different laws. 
 What will happen when I have selected the user override option?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When putting the whole organisation in scope for Cyber Essentials, then it's my understanding that all cloud services used by the organisation will be in scope.
 Has anyone managed to put the whole organisation in scope when it uses some systems and services which have limited administrative capabilities, such as lacking MFA, SSO, ability to support multiple accounts, etc. From the mock submission we've did for Cyber Essentials, a major non conformity was raised for using systems not supporting MFA. 
 In this regard Cyber Essentials appears more stringent than ISO 27001. There later indicates controls should be appropriate to the level of risk. Therefore MFA may not be a necessity if other controls can be used to mitigate risks. For Cyber Essentials, MFA as a control seems non negotiable, i.e. mandatory.
 For context, here are some examples of systems I'm thinking about: - Finance systems used to manage employee company pensions - Finance systems used to manage corporate investments - Healthcare systems used to manage private healthcare benefits - Cycle to work schemes used to offer employee benefits
 Some of these systems are big household names, used by many many companies. They are sometimes difficult to transition away from meaning they'll be in use for the foreseeable.
 In summary, I'm trying to understand if the use of such systems will cause us any issues when working towards Cyber Essentials.
 Any help and advice would be appreciated 😁

I've been in IT for six years, but my qualifications for my position included a year of previous experience supporting a VDI and raising my hand first when the prior virtualization SME left for greener pastures. I always feel like an imposter who will eventually be discovered as a fraud who bluffed their way into the position. None of this relates to my question, just trying to explain my frame of mind.
 On Friday, I was approached by one of the leads in hushed tones. He said one of the next-level supervisors was departing, and rather than try to fill their spot, their supervisory responsibilities were being split. I was asked if I would like to take a few of those (time-sheet sign-off, minor HR things) for a pay bump. Said to think about it and we'd have a bigger talk next week.
 I know the big stuff: get it in writing on my contract spelling out my responsibilities, but what else should I keep in mind? How can taking on supervisor roles affect IT work? Does anyone regret it?

 Basically I'm trying to deploy Bitlocker with the Pre-Boot PIN post-installation with a script run as MACHINE, all is well except the last part of the script where I put an exe I wrote - that asks the user to change the default Bitlocker PIN which is set up as 1234567 - in the registry, under the RunOnce key as a string, well it doesn't wait until a reboot; instead it launches this exe immediately, no reboot required.
 I have rewritten the same (idea of the) script about 30 times now, have actually spent about 20 hours in 2 days on this, and yet I cannot seem to fix this bug. Is it a bug? I haven't had this happen before with the RunOnce reg key
 Anyone else ever experienced this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey everyone, throwaway for privacy.
 I'm 21, based out of the US.
 Ever since I was a boy I loved systems and always knew this was my path, but now I'm not sure where should I focus myself.
 I did Java & Python programming in high school and realised coding isn't really for me, at least not as the main part of my job(I adore batch scripting and powershell though).
 At 16, I started learning about computer hardware via Youtube and became a remote PC consultant, I became quite good at it, consulted for over 100 different systems and built some of them personally, even offering repair services to close friends. I realised this job can't be for the long term because of the pay and left it at that.
 At 18, I worked for a telecommunication company and acquired coax & fiber knowledge alongside basic networking.
 At 19 I became a network administrator and did a bootcamp(although I did more basic helpdesk duties and network technician duties).
 Now I'm 21 and I'm leading that network administrators team(which infact does helpdesk and technician duties), I deal with onboarding/offboarding people from my company and configuring Cisco devices, IT documentation, some virtualization with VMware as well with some other physical network stuff.
 I have a homelab which has a hybrid Active directory environment mixed with azure. 
 I hold comptia a+, Microsoft az-900, az-104 and I'm close to comptia network+.
 The problem:
 From a lot of people, I hear system administration is dying, it's either moving to the cloud or getting automated so demand is decreasing.
 What can my options be? I feel that in this field it's so hard to find a path, as it expands so much
 Become a Sys admin? Focus on cloud administration? DevOps? Microsoft specialist(if that's even a thing)? Should I just quit and do a Bsc in network engineering?
 I would really appreciate if you have any insights for me.
 Thanks for reading.

 I've had a domain with Google domains for a few years now which I've held but not used it just so the name of the domain isn't taken by someone else. 
 However now with the squarespace buyout of google domains, I'm looking to move the domain to cloudfare. One of the things I liked about google domain was the cheap annual cost (£10), especially for something I'm not fully using. Checking cloudfare, I'm being quoted $20 a month for the pro package which is more than I've spend total over the past 2 years with google domains! 
 The options I think I have currently:
  
Take the cloudflare basic package and pay $0 annually. If I decide to finally use the domain to build a website I'm not sure if it will be able to handle traffic?
 
Seek an alternative domain registrar - Not sure who else can offer the same features and cost as I currently get with Google domains?
 
 Any help is appreciated!

Our infrastructure comprises various systems, among others, but not limited to: 
 Corporate Laptops and Workstations
 Employees for only Internet Access.
 Contractors and Visitors for only Internet Access
 Guests/Visitors
 Patient Monitoring Systems
 Digital Signage
 BMS (Building Management Systems)
 Access Control
 ​
 All the systems have been appropriately segmented using VLANs on wired networks.
 I have a few questions that I hope you can help me with:
 1- Considering the diversity of systems, how do I determine the optimal number of SSIDs needed for effective segmentation without causing unnecessary complexity?
 2- What are the recommended authentication methods for each SSID to ensure data security and convenient access for the respective user groups?
 3- In the context of enterprise wireless practice, should we have separate SSIDs for each band (5GHz and 2.4GHz), or is there a more efficient way to manage wireless bands for our specific setup?
 Your expertise and insights will be greatly appreciated! Thank you!

 I apologize in advance if this isn’t the right place for this post. I'm currently working as a Tier-2 helpdesk technician for a call center, which primarily comprises a remote workforce. Recently, we have been transitioning some of our users from traditional workstations to Azure CloudPC.
 Prior to this migration, our employees were using Cisco AnyConnect as their VPN solution. However, we were encountering persistent issues with call drops, primarily due to the users' connections. With the Azure CloudPC, we've seen a significant reduction in the number of dropped calls.
 Despite this improvement, we're now experiencing a new problem: there's been a noticeable audio delay reported by the users who've been migrated.
 While searching for solutions, I came across this, which introduces a concept of multimedia redirection: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-desktop/multimedia-redirection-intro
 I'm wondering if anyone here has encountered similar issues or can provide insights into whether this multimedia redirection could serve as an effective remedy to our audio delay problem. We use Five9 contact center software. Any advice or experience you could share would be greatly appreciated. I’m just sick of all these tickets coming in. 
 Thank you in advance.

Most the below are already configured but I wonder if I am missing something. 
  
Group policies for removing old profiles
 CC Cleaner on schedule (scan and update)
 Antivirus scan and definition update on schedule (already configured)
 De-fragmentation on schedule (already configured)
 Windows updates and reboots on schedule (already configured)
 Veeam Backup on schedule (already configured)
  
Monthly manual:
  
BIOS and firmware
 Drive space
 SMART health
  
I would also love to configure some sort of monitoring software where I can receive email reports of AV scans and anything else you may suggest. If it helps, I plan on deploying our first Linux machine where I will be installing LibreNMS to monitor the network hardware so feel free to suggest something Linux based. 
 Thank you.
 P.S. I am a novice sysadmin hence the basic question.

 Developers tend to use things more like DOT net sdk, vscode, visual studio code, nodejs, some SSMS, etc.

 My assumption is that a network firewall can filter traffic between different subnets, so you cannot put a firewall to filter traffic in same broadcast domain, right?
 I'm saying this becase this article seems to imply that a firewall can filter traffic in the same subnet:
 If your network doesn’t have a guest wifi network and your Iot devices are on the same subnet as all other devices, you could (but it may be cumbersome) assign a static IP to MAC address assignment for the IoT devices so they get a block of IP addresses an assign firewall rules to that block so that it can’t talk to the rest of the network that is on the same broadcast domain (really? I assumed a firewall doesn’t filter within the same subnet), but again, even so, those devices would have access to the mgmt. interface, so you should set up a very strong username and pw.

 I have a customer that purchased a refurb Dell R440 and I went ahead and used a Dell ISO from another clients Digital Locker to install Server 2022 Standard as that is the environment my customer will be using, but yet hasnt obtained licensing yet for.
 When I boot into Server 2022, the OS works but it isn't activated. Is it possible to install or activate the trial from a non activated standard installation?
 I know this sounds backwards (as it is), but I need a functioning server using the 180 day trial otherwise I keep getting D/C'd with networking and stuff while prepping for their migration project. The reason why I used a Dell Digital Locker ISO is to ensure that the drivers and everything during deployment would be included in the install.
 I'm also familiar with actually changing product keys and activating/upgrading using the following documentation: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/get-started/upgrade-conversion-options#converting-between-retail-volume-licensed-and-oem-licenses but there is no option to change from a running un-activated Server license to a trial listed.
 Any help would be appreciated. I'd like to avoid having to re-install everything again.
 Thanks in advance.

 I don’t even know where to start with this, or really why I am dumping it here. I guess I am hoping at the very least the act of writing it down will help. Maybe I'll even find someone that’s been here. Perhaps I’ll just end up deleting this.
 I think I’m burned out, and I can’t see a way back.
 I’ve been in IT for 21 years. Desktop mainly, with dips in and out of infrastructure, but always user-facing.
 I got pressured young, like so many of us, to find a ‘proper’ job and after one false start (doing something completely unrelated), it felt like all the ‘adults’ around me cranked up the intensity on said properness, and I had to get work fast. So I took a job selling records and movies and hardware at a big name chain store (which I loved) while searching for a way into IT. Why?…]]></summary>

 I currently have FolderRedirect in use.
 I have enabled in the GPO that the start menu and some other folders should also be stored there.I would like to undo this for some folders now that it is stored in the "normal" profile.
 Is there any way I can get the contents of the folders back into the user profile? As far as I know, these folders are then empty in the profile, or in the old state.
 Does anyone have an idea what I can do? Or is there only the solution to copy the files and contents manually or with a script?
 Thanks
 ​
 EDIT: I'm not sure, that i had enabled the option "redirect the folder back", before i enabled FolderRedirect.
 Is there any way I can see what settings FolderRedirect used to create the folders?

 I recently joined a company and responsible for migrating our EAP-CHAINING with AnyConnect NAM module to TEAP without NAM Module. (with Windows GPO)

 My questions are :
 1- Do I have to deploy the certificates to both user and computer using Active Directory Certificate Services ?
 I have followed for both user and computer certificates. 
 Also , already issued certificates for computers :

 We currently manage our own terrestrial infrastructure globally and purchase our own capacity across these links for our global clients.
 Like all businesses, there is a push to drive down cost, get better visibility, and be more agile in getting sharp pricing. 
 Current annual spend is 6-10M USD. 
 Currently our network is driven by MPLS and with a wider adoption of SDWAN, has anyone transitioned over to a full SDWAN core?
 There are two motives, one is to reduce cost on the terrestrial. Is it now time to look at other global carriers to offload some of our circuits, or is this likely to have a negative effect on cost when we manage it ourselves. 
 The second, can we achieve better outcomes utilising our own SDWAN core, incorporating internet solutions as backup paths with global ports in different POPs etc. Utilsing a SDWAN core could potentially remove the requirement for a MPLS equipment and utilize SDWAN software (and likely cheaper hardware) for the routing engines, maybe cheaper than utilising a Juniper/Cisco core?
 Has anyone gone down a change in mindset on service delivery?

 My current title is Systems Engineer at a small MSP. I got a title bump and a raise a couple of weeks ago. We’re a team of 4 and come Monday we will be a team of 3. This essentially puts me in a senior mentor position. I know one of my team members can handle their own self under pressure while my other colleague lacks the experience / depth of knowledge to own a sufficiently technical case without supervision. 
 We manage everything from firewalls, backups, clusters down to networked and USB printers for most of our clients. At this point my boss expects me to step away from the technical and assume an operational role which would be nearly impossible with the current situation. I have closely worked with these folks and we all know each others’ strengths and weaknesses.
 It all just feels like stepping into someone else’s shoes that are 2 sizes too large.

 I'm setting up the on-prem infrastructure for my family's small business (start-up). Currently, there are 10 laptops and approximately 10 users.
 We have Microsoft 365 Business Basic licenses (1 TB storage per user).
 Major requirements for the AD:
  
Locking down application installs (UAC admin only)
 No unnecessary downloads(Torrents, any media etc)
 Forcing logoff during nonactive hours/ forcing Windows updates
 Roaming profiles with predefined software installations
 Remotely accessing laptops for troubleshooting any issues
 File server (For sharing files within the network or outside)
 Daily backups
  
Please suggest anything I missed, it is my first time setting up a server. 
 Note: We are not hosting any applications or using Azure AD in our company. I did not find any use case or need more reading of it's documentation. 
 Questions
  
Which version of Windows Server? 2016 or 2019? Standard or Essentials?
 Should I go for a file server along with the DC or Onedrive is enough?
 Is a server on the premises necessary or Azure AD can do my work?
  
Please guide.

 I am working on a new DWDM project to upgrade our optical line system to a newer version that support SSON.
 Currently we are on the design phase , and we faced a problem during simulating 400G circuits (Higher than 60Gbaud) on one of our long spans , as the modeling tool is reporting very bad OSNR.
 In order to improve the results ; one of the parameters that we changed was the SD (Spectral Density) , and we noticed that the OSNR of the circuit was greatly enhanced once we decreased the Spectral Density.
 Was wondering if anyone can explain the relation between the spectral density and OSNR , also if we changed the spectral density setting on the optical gears , shouldnt that affect the existing signals , as we are changing how the whole spectrum with its frequencies is alocated ?
 Thanks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[3% - 16% ping Packet loss in hardwired connection between USW switches and UDM Pro
 Any idea why I would see such high packet loss between 2 switches and a UDM Pro?
 UDMPro is 192.168.1.1, ping results are from a hardwired macbook to the UDM pro pinging a USW-24 -PoE switch (192.168.1.4) and a USW-24-Poe-PRO (192.168.1.3)
 Both switches are connected independently wired to different ports on the UDM Pro.
 Changed cables out, still seeing loss.
 Problem just started happening this morning and I updated everything to the latest version of firmware (what!)
 I searched /var/log/messages on the pro but didn't see anything untoward either.
 SSH into the UDM pro shows cpu temp and load are nominal. Unifi support tickets are rubbish, probably should switch this crap out.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Friends,
 We are planning to move from our current MPLD WAN (from service provider A) to SDWAN (Palo & service B) with a one more service provider. So we will be running two providers links at the same time...
 So my questions: Currently, our public domain names pointing to public IPs provided by Provider A, how can we get Public DNS to point to the new IPs at the same time?, For example, mail.company.domain.net or adfsproxy.companydomain.net pointing to two public IPs Is this possible? Any issues I should consider? 
 Thanks Larry

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I have been working at this job for about 1.75 years now and its been a trial.
 Only assured part time despite often doing months of full time work, no wage increases, no permanent full time, no benefits whatsoever. Total toxic workplace .
 I am not sad to see that gone. 
 I had a hunch that something like this may happen, as the new director we got is totally IT illiterate and I'm still wondering how the hell he got the job as he was new to the company. I figured because I couldn't perform the miracles he wanted of me yesterday that he would try and get me removed .
 ​
 Instead it seems to come down from the ownership that they are going in a different direction and plan to outsource me (likely cheaper). 
 I have been trying to find another job, but the job market in my area is cutthroat and a lot of the jobs I have applied for either need more experience, they never return my calls or the posting is cancelled as they don't have the budget for it.
 ​
 Its annoying to go back on EI for the time being, but not much choice.
 ​
 Not sure what the point of this post is, I think maybe just a bit of venting .
 I do take some small comfort that things are going to suck for the other employees shortly, as they are rolling out a new system this week that had the other IT staff running around trying to fix the broken mess so they don't have me to fill the holes of other issues and the ticketing system. 
 There will be complaints streaming in soon and I don't think my remaining senior IT staff will stick around long, as he hired me to help him out and now he has to do what I do on top of his job.

 The first bears a date of January 2004 and (62.5/125) on the jacket. OM1. Yuck.
 The second bears a date of May 2010 and (MM50 PRETIUM 150) on the jacket which Google/Corning says is OM2. Also yuck. But not as yuck.
 The distance marker indicates that the run is 580 feet from conduit mouth to conduit mouth. There's another 30-40 feet coiled up near the termination box on either end.
 And that's not all. The newly selected network closet for each building, where the run will actually enter the switches, will require another 50-100ft on either end.
 So, switch to switch, we're looking at a maximum distance of 860ft / 262meters. It MIGHT be a bit less than that, but not much less.
  
So what's the play here? Can we get 10GBIT/s out of this or are we going to be LACP'ing some 1gig connections to try and get close?
 I don't think 10GBASE-LRM + Mode conditioning patch cable gets us there either; most have said the max distance is 220m. 
 What would you do if you were in my situation?
 We can't pull new Single-Mode fiber for a bunch of stupid reasons, but the main one is that the conduit between the buildings hits an outside junction box. That junction box is... underneath a concrete parking lot now. Yeah. They poured Concrete over it. We've tried pulling on some of the MMF to see if we could use it as a pullcord, but no luck.

The reporting needs to be able to aggregate usage and not just show a monthly report with hourly averages. It needs to be able to capture daily averages in minutes for example during peak usage times. The basic reporting tools built in monitoring tools tend not to be able to do this. I have seen a few products that will aggregate the data because keeping all the data and running a OnDemand report just takes too long over extended periods. It can be a monitoring and reporting tool or just a easy to use reporting tool we can feed API data to for example. Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Got hired by a small company 3 months ago. The only IT employee for the past 15 years was a guy 60+ and promoted to "Manager" to onboard me and one other, less technical, new hire.
 He gets confused a lot. Admits he feels confused/incoherent sometimes. Takes a lot of days off. Tells us he's in and out of the doctor's offices multiple times a week. Expresses his interest in just sitting back and taking it easy now to let us take over.
 Unfortunately I've also found tons of issues across the system, including the fact that our product we sell to customers is just not very good. Customers are unhappy, and I want to work at a place I am proud of. Our MS licensing is a mess and management doesn't seem interested in hearing my concerns on it. Really... just problems I don't want to deal with since I've learned I'd rather just write SQL than be an IT generalist for a small outdated business.
 So, when an opening came up through someone I know to go back to doing that, I took it, and gave my notice today. It will almost certainly be better for me. I just feel really bad for leaving this guy who has bigger problems than work to be dealing with, and sounded like he was putting a lot of faith in me sticking around.

 No iLO configured so unable to check raid health or other such things. Half the drivers were missing so couldn’t use any of the tools we would usually want to use as couldn’t talk to the hardware and I believe all would have required a reboot to install anyway. No separate system and data drive. All one volume. No hot spare. 
 Turns out raid array was flagging errors for months. 
 A simple reboot and it’s fucked.

 For some reason I'm having some issues with a local BGP session being stuck in active using pathvector (bird 2.0) and pfsense (FRR)
 The IP of the bird router is provided by the frr router's LAN, it's pingable on both sides. 
 Frrs neighbor config is pretty standard, nothing differing from any other established connections there. I'm a little bit confused because it's literally a local connection so no need for multihop! Trying to announce another ASN through a 2nd router basically and upstream it with our main one. 
 Any pointers to look into? We have a handful of peers, I've been doing bgp for a while and am pretty stumped. I'm not seeing anything in the logs, and I'm also just not sure why it's stuck considering the ips are pingable on both sides. No firewall or port filtering, I've made sure to set static routes on the bird router, ASNs are correct, router IDs are not conflicting, etc. It's a local connection, there is no reason that I can tell that it'd get stuck.
 Any help would be kind, thank you!

 So I'm being challenged on why we are insisting on having the ability to remote wipe corporate emails on personal moblies, specifically Outlook via the Outlook Device Policy.
 The argument is that you can just disable the account and the person cannot get into the mailbox anymore.
 I have argued that what if you don't want to disable the account, you just want to remove the emails.
 I'd appreciate your thoughts as this is being argued by a very senior member of the organisation.
 Also Outlook Device Policy states it should wipe on bad logons. Our policy in Exchange Online states 8 bad attempts, but I can do 20 or more and it doesn't wipe, so I'm note sure what's happening there...

Something they've known about for 3-6 months but have only approached IT at the last minute because "the previous guy would do it " or it's just expected...
 How many of you would tell them to piss off? Genuine question.
 Edit : WOW! Some great responded guys and gals. My biggest issue has always been that IT departments around the world have been too easy to push over & not willing enough to fight their own corners over unpaid short notice overtime & insisting on new kit

 Currently working on a SDWAN environment and I need you input about MSTeams.
 We just switched a site to SDWAN using simply an MPLS transport connection. However, we recently received a report on the quality of the MSTeam. In light of this, I'm curious as to what would be the ideal practice for guaranteeing the MSTeam's priority (e.g. QOS, Symmetrical flow etc) and what steps would be necessary for troubleshooting what I need to examine (e.g. Routing, Latency, utilization)?
 I'm still gathering more information regarding the problem, but one thing I checked is the latency of the MSapplication which is only 100ms, and there is no jitter from the Analytics. No congestion as well. Since DIA is not an option right now, MPLS is our only choice.
 Thank you,
 ​

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have 4 sites all connected via Meraki auto-VPN. At the moment one of the MX250 firewalls at one site is accepting all Anyconnect client VPN connections. We'd like to set up load balancing and failover of the VPN connections by enabling VPN connections on 1 other office. I setup 2 dns records with our provider using their lb/failover option, which just requires specifying the desired DNS name, and the multiple IP addresses to use for lb/failover. It is working great, but I'm seeing a possible snag with SSL certs on the Meraki appliance. Is there any problem with creating 2 SSL certs, 1 for each office, which specify different host IP addresses, but the same DNS name? If a custom SSL cert is not used, AnyConnect gives a security pop-up message every time a user connects because it wants the Meraki Dynamic DNS name to be used for connection. Tried creating a cert with GoDaddy and it keeps giving me errors, and neither vendor seems to know what the issue is.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for a small (150 student, 50 staff), single purpose college. We're looking for a new phone system to replace our aged one (~12 y/o, on prem). I'm looking at Zoom and RingCentral, and am hoping to get some feedback on either of these companies with respect to their phone system products.
 Background: We currently use Zoom for our videoconferencing needs, as well as our online classroom education. We've been pretty happy with them, and I'm leaning that direction because training would be minimal. Ring has a slick presentation, and it looks like they'd be about 30% cheaper.
 What has been your experience with either of these platforms, and how well did you like the service provided by the company involved when there were technical or administrative (read: billing) issues?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Image of emails. Barracuda is currently failing entirely to block them, and each email is pretty distinct - however they all contain at least one line I was able to use to set up quarantining. I was attempting to set up quarantining for anything with an emoji in the subject, but barracuda's implementation of regex appears to be broken and they can't even figure it out. This has persisted for more than 24 hours and the volume is very, very high so I thought it was weird I couldn't find anyone else talking about this. 
 If you folks check your filters, do you see these getting caught? Or is anyone else seeing a flood of this exact email campaign slipping through?
 We also had some other unusual test-like emails slip through, and it makes me feel like we're in the midst of something highly targetted, but it's also.... very lazy. So on the one hand I am wondering if this is a bizarre targetted campaign that's just really sloppy, and on the other I'm wondering if this is just what AI spam is going to look like going forward, if it looks like trash to humans but was carefully trained to sneak around whatever email security the target is using.
 Replying to the emails sends an auto reply that sends you through a few URLs, but nothing seemed to be working or trying to do anything. https://imgur.com/a/Q825KHI

I can start/stop VLC to generate another IGMP join but the idea was to set up VLC on a PC and leave it running.
 Is anyone aware of how to make VLC send more joins? An alternative if you have it would also be cool or if I'm approaching this the wrong way I'm cool with a redirection. Thanks!

 I want to basically separate the WAN as soon as it comes in the door, such that each organization has their own LAN with an IP address space (and DHCP pool), along with being able to share existing APs such that each LAN has their own SSID(s). 
 Is that easy enough with a Meraki appliance or do I have to look for new equipment?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there, just providing some Google-Fu code for anyone who may stumble across this or be interested.
 I had to unzip ~500 1-4GB .7z files. Performing this task through the 7-Zip File Manager creates a batch job, running one at a time sequentially. Unzipping is CPU-limited, so it's going to take hours and hours to run. Running in a normal batch takes up 12% (1 of 8 cores, 100/8), there is plenty of power leftover.
 Powershell 7.3 introduces the -Parallel parameter for ForEach-Object, pretty useful and can massively speed things up. After some experimenting, I made some code that may be helpful to others.
 Note that this is for .7z files, installing the 7Zip4Powershell Module adds the command "Expand-7Zip". If you are using regular .zip files, use "Expand-Archive" and it's associated parameters.
 #Install 7Zip4Powershell Module [Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12 Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -MinimumVersion 2.8.5.201 -Force Set-PSRepository -Name 'PSGallery' -SourceLocation "https://www.powershellgallery.com/api/v2" -InstallationPolicy Trusted Install-Module -Name 7Zip4PowerShell -Force #Install Powershell 7.3 or higher winget search Microsoft.Powershell Y winget install –id Microsoft.Powershell –source winget Y #Exit Powershell, open Powershell 7 from Start Menu $PSVersionTable Should have a PSVersion of at least 7.3.X #Execute Parallel Unzipping Import-Module 7Zip4PowerShell $Dir="C:\SourceDir" cd $Dir $Zips=Get-ChildItem "$Dir\*.7z" $Zips | ForEach-Object -Parallel {Expand-7Zip -ArchiveFileName $_ -TargetPath ($_).BaseName} -ThrottleLimit 7 #For the TargetPath parameter, "($_).BaseName" creates a directory based on the name of each 7z file, minus the extension. If you don't want a folder created for each ZIP, and would prefer they be unzipped into the source directory, just use "$_". #For the ThrottleLimit parameter, set the number to the # of your CPU cores minus 1, otherwise it bogs down the machine.

 In a purely Link state routing protocol world, if a computer wants to send packets to a computer on another autonomous system, how would one routing table knows which router is closest to the other autonomous system?
 also, are ISPs just an enormous network operator with a gigantic routing table for all of their own routers? And when they say that autonomous systems communicate between each other to find the shortest path, do they keep a table of "cross system" paths or do they just communicate every time they need to know what's going on in another autonomous space? I hope I'm being clear.

 All right, I've had it with the shut down shenanigans! I instruct the users to restart their machines (most often these are laptop users) once they start having weird issues as that resolves a lot of those. I'm just tired of explaining to users (who want to be helpful by the way) that "Shutting it down and turning it on" is not the same as "Restarting". So I have situations where they would say they restarted as asked but uptime tells a different story. With that out of the way, what is the best way to make "Shut down" actually shut the machine down instead of hibernating it or whatever it's doing. Do I run "powercfg.exe /hibernate off" when building the machine? But then I'm not sure if Microsoft would turn it back on with one of their updates. Or would it be better through some group policy? or something else? I just want it permanently gone. What is your experience with it?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Wanted to create a list for new/junior engineers looking to grow. Any one else wish to add to my list, please feel free. What I am laying down are the rules taught to me by my mentor. An engineer who started with Cisco in 1989 and literally designed and oversaw Caterpillar/BMW/Mercedes etc etc etc global networks before he retired.
 Rule #1 Be hungry to learn. Every interaction, even after 30+ years of networking, is an opportunity to learn and grow. Being humble and hungry also makes you more desirable to work with!
 Rule #2 Lab. Even if you think you have the right answer, you are probably wrong if you haven't labbed! If you are learning something new, lab it up. Take packet captures to see if you get the expected packets. Learn to read said packets while in the lab. Never forget to lab.
 Rule #3 RFCs, RFCs, RFCs. Taking the time to look up an RFC is generally faster than contacting a consultant or vendor for a detailed answer. It is likely, they are going to read said RFC before replying back to you.
 Rule #4 Follow the packets. Our job revolves around moving packets from A-B or from C to D-K. Understand where a packet comes in from and why then where it is going to move to next and why. Do this node by node. Whether this is super basic VLAN only or the crazy complex Multicast over EVPN, following the path of the packet is a concept which will never die!
 Rule #5 When following the network path, draw out the topology. You may have 50 devices in your whole network but the packet for source to destination may only cross 4 devices. Understanding this will always greatly simply things and prevent a 4-day marathon of troubleshooting an issue. In most cases, shortens those sessions to just a few hours or less.
 Rule #6 See rule #1.

 I help maintain dnsReaper which is a subdomain takeover tool. It's free, available on GitHub and docker and looks for domains vulnerable to domain takeovers.
 Today we've added 2 new integrations!
 Project discovery have a massive database of subdomains called CHAOS and you can now query and test domains in dnsReaper.
 We've also added SecurityTrails, which also has a huge public subdomain list.
 This means that you can just point dnsReaper at a bug bounty domain and let it run. There will be false positives for sure, but we have 61 signatures so hopefully there will be some nice easy findings too.
 Our blog post on the new features is here:
 https://punksecurity.co.uk/blog/dnsreaper_pd/
 Our GitHub is over here:
 https://github.com/punk-security/dnsReaper
 It's a free tool that we built just to highlight this issue and educate. Please give it a star and share it, we'd appreciate it.

 Our company has a mix of Windows and Linux & AIX machines. We patch all the Windows machines every month using PDQ, WSUS, and SCCM. However, we don't patch the Linux/AIX machines at all. I'm not a strong Linux person but I'm looking for information on how people manage the non-Windows based computers.
 Are there programs that can inventory and automate the process by sending patches to the machines that need them? Can I just send a command to every machine and they will install what they need? Can I specify only Security patches vs all patches? What options are there that I should look into?
 I'd prefer free tools but would consider paid ones if they are worth the cost. Our company is currently looking at BigFix because it can apparently patch every OS out there, but I've read a lot of things about how crazy expensive and complicated it is so if there's a better way to go, let me know.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 Question for you folks, so let's say i have a site connected to my MPLS cloud with two or more circuits. What's the best way - best practice - to provide redundancy for the TE tunnels? 
 I have a team with quite sensitive application that requires minimal failover time. So trying to find best solution.
 I was thinking about creating separate tunnel interfaces with different explicit-path. But this solution seems to be hard to maintain. I'm probably missing something - help please.
 Cheers,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm just confused and just a beginner, I would like to ask if i can establish a connection for pure bgp only ? Or do i need another routing protocol for bgp to work ? As i tried something like this for experimentation.
 R1 <> R2 <> R3 <> R4 
  
 R2 & R3 have same AS 
 
After i established my bgp. All Routes from R2 & R3 are visible at R1 except the routes from R4 vice versa. 
 
Another question. Why can't I ping the loopback of R3 even though it already shows at the bgp table of R1? 
 
 Please help me. Thank you

 Done the same with the actual remover tool from them as well, which prompted for the tamper protect pass, entered that , then failed to uninstall. Cool so i drag and drop it to the recycle bin, empty it and reboot. Cool looks gone
 Attempt to reinstall, installer and it states that installation failed, as "your system has the sophos endpoint product installed"
 So i cant uninstall, i cant reinstall. Anyone seen this

 ​
 I am reaching out in this sub as when I search for thin client issues or questions, this sub seems to appear the most on google.
 ​
 I am working on deploying an Hp T540 thin client as a kiosk to limit functionality to a specific site. We use windows configuration designer to provision a kiosk package for all versions of windows. 
 ​
 My colleague and I are running into an issue where when we run the kiosk package on the thin client and log into the account declared in the xml file (.\user), we can't log in. We enter the password, it says welcome, spins and then says signing out. We never get to the desktop. When we remove the kiosk package from the device, logged in as the local admin account, we are able to log back into .\user.
 ​
 I connected with HP and they were stumped on it, and my colleague says he checked through the registry and couldn't find anything.
 ​
 Do you all have any ideas of what could be the issue?

 I started at my current role with basically no knowledge, which I thought was made pretty clear during interviewing ect that i've built my own computer and feel confident enough with hardware related issues, but software/AD/troubleshooting is all new to me
 Anyway, I'm 8 months into my helpdesk role, have had basically no training a real sink or swim environment, while they haven't said anything bad about me, I just feel like I'm not doing good enough, 90% of the tickets I get I can't do or spend an hour googling how to do it. 
 Worst part is, people get paid less than me and know how to do 10x what I know, confuses me alot.
 I barley understand AD, I can barley setup local-admin accounts without getting confused or needing to confirm I'm doing it right, it's also an MSP so every clients setup is different, I don't understand basic networking like DCHP, DNS ect and I've tried to study, I've home labbed and I can set things up and fix things when following guides without a problem, the issue arises when I don't have a guide to follow. 
 Can anyone recommend some good study material for DNS, DHCP to understand them so I can get my head around it in different environments, sick of feeling stupid every single day.

 I hope someone can answer this. I have a riser cage for my Proliant Gen10 dl360 1u server and I want to populate the x8 slot on it with a NVME drive card and a x16 slot with a Nvidia GPU such as RTX A4000. My question is, if I use both slots on the riser cage at the same time, will I lose any performance? The riser cage connects to the motherboard using something which looks like a dual PCIE x16 slots. Does anyone know how it works? 
 Here's an ebay listing for the riser cage I have.

 We have meetings rooms where's due to small SSDS in the machines, they got fed up with having to remove user profiles too often rather then fix it, (bigger ssd, delprof2 script or many others)
 so they decided it be a good idea to have an autologin to generic account, with a move to 365 users are logging to teams and clicking the ''ok'' to sign into all apps as its more prominent in the menu.
 this then means upon login out of teams, that its now connected on the school or account so its logged in everywhere.
 I'm explaining this to them and asking for it to be removed and fix the root cause issue I mentioned earlier... (i've already asked about windows guest mode)
 ​
 ​
 they have come back and said below, can you let me know if this actually exists or are they out to lunch?
 ''
 if this is the case then most likely they have the single-use version of 365 rather than the shared switch which stops the saving of creds 
 log a call for any that you find and we can switch them over ''

 I am having a strange problem. DFS-R is replication files and folders and fully "in-sync". If I change, add, remove a file, everyting is working.
 ​
 But: If I rename a folder, the change is _sometimes_ replicated and _sometimes_ not or it takes a very long time, until the change is replicated.
 Get-DfsrBacklog does not show any pending changes for folder-renames.
 Changes of files INSIDE the non-rename-replicated-folder are changed fine.
 ​
 Did you ever see that behaviour and do you have any idea on how to fix this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In the fast-paced world of information technology, data centers and their equipment play a pivotal role in supporting critical operations. At the heart of every data center lies the 19" server rack – a silent workhorse that has evolved significantly over the years. In this article, we take a journey through time to explore the history and technological advancements that have shaped 19" server racks into the indispensable components they are today.
 The Genesis of 19" Server Racks
 Back in the day, data centers looked nothing like the sleek facilities we see today. Those massive mainframes occupied entire rooms, leaving little space for anything else. Can you imagine that? As the need for better organization and efficient data management arose, the ingenious concept of server racks was born in the 1970s. But wait, there's more! The 19" width standard came into play, bringing order to the chaotic world of data centers and allowing different equipment to coexist peacefully in standardized enclosures.

 We are looking into MS Defender and JAMF Wandera Radar since we already have both licensed anyway. Defender has proven itself as pretty much useless as even accessing an Eicar url was not detected / prevented. Radar performed much better. Ideally we’d like to use Defender tho as we already have alerting, reporting and processes established around it.

 Wireless isn't my strong point (certainly not the layer 1 stuff - channels, frequencies, power etc). So I'm wondering how the pros would diagnose low level wireless issues? Specifically i'm talking about poor performance - dropouts, high latency, dropped packets etc) on a wireless network in an industrial environment.
 Are there specific hardware and software tools one would use to look at channel utilisations and that sort of thing?
 Any help is much appreciated.
 Thanks

Not really looking at jobs yet, just mainly brushing up on old subjects and equipment configs that i haven't done in awhile and a thought struck me. Now that we live in a post covid world, what is the outlook for Network engineers to be fully remote? At the beginning of 2021 i worked as a temp IT support tech for a few months for a local resort whose network support was located in a different state. Yes, the engineers would visit every now and again but mostly they would remote in whenever there was a problem or a need to. This resorts company had properties nation wide but their network support team was based in FL. I'm curious as to how common this type of arrangement is. Thanks for reading, look forward to all your comments.

 I realize that most jobs require at least bachelors and 1+ years of experience, or just 5+ years of experience. I haven’t started university yet but I don’t want to wait 4-5 years before I’m able to find an entry level job, and I want to gain DevOps/SysAdmin experience before getting my bachelor’s. (not necessarily looking to make money, but even the smallest amount would be a bonus. I need something that can also go on my resume as past experience.)
 Any suggestions on what I could do?

 I remember the first few times when I started getting pushback on this, and realised those days were coming to an end. The early internet was such a wild west, I miss those days.

All devices on the /24 have their own firewall, and are considered to be "on the public internet". I would like to use OSPF to distribute routes between these routers so that, for example, a laptop with a private IP behind Router 1 could print to a printer that has a private IP behind Router 2. 
 Am I correct in assuming that it would be a bad idea to use the interfaces associated with the public /24 for distributing routes via OSPF, because that would effectively be routing packets from internal devices over an un-trusted network? Or is this a non-issue and I am over-complicating it? I am currently planning on creating a new interface on each router with a new broadcast domain, purely for distributing routes.

 I'll read the docs and tutorials, but I'd like to have an idea of what I'll be doing before I get started on them as to set my focus.
 My intended setup is pretty basic and for a small site:
  
Am looking at 4 or more XV series access points, will add more if needed.
 
Two SSIDs: one for the internal network VLAN and one for 'visitor wifi' VLAN.
 
WPA2 PSK Passphrase authentication.
 
SSID for internal network VLAN to be restricted by device / MAC address.
 
 Have registered with cnMaestro so I can start having a play before the access points arrive and it looks fairly intuitive.
 Any pointers and/or a brief rundown of what to expect would be appreciated, thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just landed my first sysadmin job about 3 months ago. I applied for a help desk job, and after the interviews they offered me an admin position. Now, I'm trying hard to learn the systems I'm supposed to be maintaining, but find that a large portion of my day is spent scrensharing with end users and helping them with basic issues that our tier 1 people should have resolved. Tickets come into my queue with almost no documentation from the help desk. It seems like they see keywords in the customer's description and just immediately escalate it without doing any work. Does anyone else have this issue in their company, and how do you tactfully tell them to do their fucking job?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[edit: nvm. Apparently my gns3 topology got corrupted somehow. A brand new topo and things work just fine.
 -=-=-=-
 I have the simplest possible topology in gns:
  
Cisco: e0/0(10.10.10.1/24) <---> Debian FRRouting eth0(10.10.10.99/24)
 router eigrp 888
 network 10.10.10.0/24
  
Adjacencies will immediately form, but then FRRouting drops the adjacency with the log message "EIGRP packet header type 5 unsupported." Timers expire and the process begins again.
 I started with the debian distro package which I think is 8.4.2. Then I tried the .deb package from frrouting.org which is the latest, 8.5.2. In both of these versions eigrpd crashes and is restarted by the watchdog over and over.
 I even built it from scratch and used the forked eigrpd repo. At least with this version eigrpd no longer crashes, but it still cannot maintain an adjacency.
 I'm kind of out of ideas at this point. Does anyone have experience with this?

 The questions:
  
Is this something all network monitoring tools provide? How useful are they ?
 Is there a way to get granular forecasts (not just in/out bytes) . packet counts, sizes, flow duration etc. by IP addresses/ports ? Is this even useful?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I come from being a network security engineer at a mid-size company. I just started a month ago at a new Fortune 100 company with a massive, stupidly complex network. 
 I am so overwhelmed. Everything is behind jumpboxes (poorly documented) so it’s difficult to understand what to jump through in order to connect to anything, making manual network discovery difficult. 
 I come from a Cisco shop, and everything is Juniper and Arista here. 
 There are literally dozens of VRFs inside their internal MPLS core. They run EVPN and VXLAN, stuff I’ve never worked with before. There are dozens and dozens of firewalls. The team has started a new network segmentation project, and there is little to no documentation on what subnets belong to each segment, what ‘zones’ are in each segment, etc. 
 I feel like I’m drowning. Normally I try to buckle down and start from the core and work my way outward, documenting physical and logical connections, but this place has literally hundreds of devices in the core. The routing is extremely complex with tons of BGP, MPLS, EVPN, VXLAN, VRFs everywhere, SDWAN.
 Just need some advice. Words of encouragement. SOMETHING. I haven’t worked with any of this stuff and feel so damn burnt out at the end of the day that I physically can’t get myself to study anything. I feel like it’s only a matter of time until I’m fired.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a network set up and the firewall are advertising default originate into isis. The firewalls are doing iBGP between them and because of the AD of 200 routes prefer the ISIS interface to go to the other side of the network and will come in through the other firewall on return traffic because it is the default route. I was thinking it would be beneficial to set up ISIS peering across the same link as the BGP as this is a point to point and will have a reduced cost allowing the traffic from the outside networks to route that way. Will I have an issue peering two isis neighbors both advertising the default route through default originate or will I need to filter it between hosts somehow?
 Edit: thinking about it I would think the local static default route will take precidence in the firewall and the default-originate route would never be installed unless we were to lose internet peering on one side. This sounds like a win-win setting up this way.

 I cant find any IT jobs that pay more than my current salary (80k) without insane 10+ years of experience. 
 I know im stagnant in my career right now, ive gotten multiple offers from MSPs but for the same 80k im currently making. Im thinking I should take it and put in my time for 5 years or so and then ill be able to get those higher paying jobs? right?
 But if i stay at my current job for 5 years ill get my stupid 3% raise every year but gain no new valuable experience with the same technologies, and still be unable to qualify for those 100k+ jobs. right?

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is releasing this Cybersecurity Advisory to warn network defenders about exploitation of CVE-2023-3519, an unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting NetScaler (formerly Citrix) Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and NetScaler Gateway. In June 2023, threat actors exploited this vulnerability as a zero-day to drop a webshell on a critical infrastructure organization’s non-production environment NetScaler ADC appliance. The webshell enabled the actors to perform discovery on the victim’s active directory (AD) and collect and exfiltrate AD data. The actors attempted to move laterally to a domain controller but network-segmentation controls for the appliance blocked movement.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For instance, my boss wants to move towards containerization. It's one of the biggest buzzwords nowadays, but I feel like no one in my department has a full understanding of it, just the core concepts. Therefore, when they containerize something, they basically just create a docker container of it on some random VM, and that's it.
 That being said, when I do something, I like to do it right. Best practice. Learning about containerization is one thing, but getting familiar with setting up an entire infrastructure dedicated to containerization is what I'm aiming towards. What are the tools available to us, both open source and paid? Can I just set up a Portainer machine and run all of our containers there? We've looked into OpenShift but it's insanely expensive. What's a better alternative?
 When I start down these rabbit holes, I do so with a fiery motivation. But eventually I get overwhelmed with not knowing what I don't know, and getting lost with the billion options, albeit none that are comprehensive.
 That's just one example of many in the infinitely complex world of IT. How do you deal with stuff like that?

 I come to you with a challenge (at least for me) and I think I might understand how to solve it but I wanted to ask here as my resources and experience at work are limited.
 Before I get further, I work as a Systems Administrator with about 2-years basic network administration at my organization. I have studied for the CCNA and CCNP back in school about 10 years ago but working heavily as a systems admin and not being able to touch networking in the past has held me back a bit.
 Anyways, I've got a large office-production site that has a 10.32.0.0/16 subnet. We also have 10.33.0.0/16, 10.35.0.0/16 and 10.37.0.0/16 for various systems/voip. 
 We are not anywhere near close to using up our available address space :-). This entire net…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why does anyone let vendors build solutions in our environments with bad practices like using named users instead of service accounts for databases?
 I have a database that runs under a named user account that was built by a vendor and the named account belongs to a person who's no longer there. So of course we've already terminated the user and they're no longer in AD. If I try to create a new user with the same username of course the SID doesn't match so it can't authenticate to the database to do any owner operations or assign a new db_owner. Of course because we let the vendor manage their stuff in our network they didn't add my team as db_owner I can't do anything in the DB and they've lost the default DB creds which they never provided to us in the first place.
 If anybody has any ideas how I can get past this problem without having to rebuild the database for an existing production solution I would be eternally grateful.
 And if you work for a vendor: I'm not mad at you but push back against crap practices like this. If you manage a solution for your clients, in their network or yours, it's your responsibility to maintain appropriate access to data and resources. That means making sure you don't delete the only account which has access to those resources. Same goes for everyone, of course.
 [Edit] ok, not all vendors suck. That blanket statement has been removed.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are currently using a classic VPN setup to allow our employees to connect to the office network and GCP, but we want to enhance our security and adopt a zero trust or overlay network approach. I've been researching two main overlays for this task - Netmaker and Tailscale - but I'm having difficulty deciding between them.
 Our setup involves hosting some products in GCP and running internal services on Dell servers. We have a mix of workstations with different operating systems, and our network is segregated into VLANs.
 Both Netmaker and Tailscale offer different advantages and disadvantages. Tailscale, being a userspace WireGuard, might have slower speeds, while Netmaker could require more deployment and maintenance effort. However, the choice between the two may also depend a bit on how far we want to take the zero trust approach. For instance, should communication between two servers internally go through this solution? Is having to manage the ACL settings in a JSON file a good or bad thing (infra as code)? 
 If any of you have encountered a similar dilemma or have experience with either Netmaker or Tailscale, I'd greatly appreciate your insights. Did you end up choosing one of these products, and how did it work out for you? Are there other products that could be better than the two I'm currently looking at?

 This problem is probably old hat but I'm having trouble getting a solution: (I also tried r/WindowsServerAdmin)
 I need to monitor Windows Domain Users (they use the same computer/IP every day) web access. For example, I want to see a list of web domains they access. They are accessing inappropriate content 'family filtering' provided by cloudflare (1.1.1.3, 1.0.0.3) doesn't block (such as Maxim, SportsIllustrated). This way I can see what they are accessing, as to block them. Currently, I can't block what I don't know about.
 We are using a Windows Domain, and Windows DNS with forwarding to cloudflare 1.1.1.3.
 Preferably I'd like something that uses native Windows logging features, but if that's not available, a FOSS solution would be 2nd choice. I'm trying to avoid buying products from SolarWinds and similar vendors.
 For my purposes, getting a list of web domains accessed is good enough. These users don't have access to change their DNS server settings, and if they can figure out how to bypass DNS filtering by going to a numerical IP I'd die from shock.
 Many thanks!

Each connection may be a trickle of syslogs, or may be bursty during a security event, but still relatively low bandwidth requirements. However, once they all land at the one VPN concentrator there is quite a flow of those syslog messages on the wire. We are trying to send those to a log analyzer/SIEM in the cloud, and we are trying to overcome some bandwidth cost constraints there. Syslog is normally fire-and-forget, so if we have any bandwidth contention, it is possible for some of those messages to get lost.
 What do you recommend to overcome this possible data loss? More bandwidth is the easy option, but even then how do you scale for an event that bursts above even that? I'm thinking some sort of relay that stores and forwards, but forwards across the lower bandwidth link with a reliable method (RELP or the like?) to remove or significantly lessen the likelihood of data loss.
 Or am I looking at this all wrong?

 I have this unique problem with my iPhone. I hope someone here can enlighten me.
 I have an old iPhone 8 and I want to transfer all the data to a new iPhone 12. Both are fully up to date with the newest IOS.
 The problem is that the last time the iPhone 8 has backed up to iCloud was last year 5th of July 2022.
 "Ok easy" - I'll just press Backup now and wait, then set up the new phone with the backup from iCloud...
 Wrong! The iPhone 8 fails the backup with no reasoning other than "The latest iCloud backup has failed".
 Hmm. Okay.. I'll try to do the backup from my computer with Itunes. Both to iCloud, and to "This Computer" so I can just restore it to the new iPhone 12 afterwards.
 I begin the Backup and it continues for hours and hours and hours... Until my PC has run ou…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For me it’s starting to get impossible. I’m a solo admin for my organization. I supervise a few help desk/techs even have to pickup some tickets and do some onsite visits usually. My manager has strictly forbidden me from teaching anyone how to do anything outside their current roles, meaning it’s just me for the company office. Manager does not have a background in IT so they can’t help with much.
 As the company grows I’m losing more of my free time which is irritating me as I want my two days off a week to spend time with my kids and relax. It’s also forcing my spouse to have to shorten hours that she can work which means we actually have less money than we did last year. Before anyone says get a babysitter, I’m not paying someone to watch my kids, I don’t believe I should have to.
 I make 50k a year doing my job and they won’t consider giving me a raise until fourth quarter 2024. I feel like this would just get worse if I moved on with a larger organization based on reading horror stories here and by talking to others in the field.
 I’m currently expected to work 50+ hours a week at this point and since I’m salary no OT for me. CEO firmly believes salary = availability is 24/7. I’ve tried ignoring emails and texts while off but I learned quickly it is not tolerated and treated with write ups. I’ve been told as well to just cash out PTO since I’m the only one that can do a lot of things. My manager says “You being absent for a period of time would be problematic”.
 I’m starting to feel like IT is for people who don’t have families or a life. I’ve invested a lot of time, money, education into this field but Im kinda considering getting out while I’m still young and can.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We just started receiving reports a few days ago that when a user tries to open a file on our file server (on-prem) it would take a long time to load. So we tested this and confirmed that (for testing) a 6 MB file takes a couple of minutes to open. Biggers files take longer.
 We've checked the potential server having the issue and compared it with other servers, and we have the same issue on all servers, not just one. We use VMWare and the disks, CPU, and memory all look good. We tried flipping to our standby Cisco ASA firewall, but that did not change anything. VMs can transfer between each other just fine. 
 The other day, we had one of our switch stacks re-built but that should have only impacted one location, which does not house the servers.
 So it is looking like a switch issue, but I was not part of the switch maintenance that was done and if it was only done to our one location that does not have the servers in it, why would that impact our servers?
 Any thoughts are appreciated.
 Thanks!

 I'm sure this is a super simple question but I'm new to the platform.
 I'm looking to add 1 app to 1 phone without removing everything else on the phone. I've figured out how to create the app policy and that's all fine but I can only seem to add the policy to the whole group rather than the specific device.
 Is there a way to do this better than copying all of the apps etc from the phones current group to a new group and then assigning the app to the app policy to that group?
 I'm probably over complicating it in my head 😂
 Any help would be greatly appreciate

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am posting this as the only thread I have found mentioning it is reporting problems after installing rather than during install.
 I see on that thread that at least some others are experiencing the same issue. In my case I am getting an influx of calls to report systems running very slowly, symptoms include taking 5 mins from clicking to doing anything, Microsoft Office/Outlook constantly crashing.
 I connected to some of the affected systems and in task manager the resources are ok, plenty of CPU/Memory available and, oddly, SSD running at 0-10%. I was able to reproduce the issue, composing a new email in Outlook and sending or closing that window caused an app crash, task manager crashed when I tried to close it.
 In every case, KB5028166 was installing. On some systems this update would get stuck at 73%, 74% or 90%. When rebooting, the system would hang on the blue backgound rebooting message but the circle of dots that usually appears above it was missing. It would sit here for 40+ minutes after which I had to force a reboot.
 Eventually, after several of these reboots, it seems to finally complete after which system responsiveness goes back to normal.
 I thought I would post about it to see how widespread the issue was and if anyone had found a better way to install the update. I have seen it affecting Lenovo Thinkpads and Dell Optiplex PCs, Windows 10 Pro 22H2.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[System architecture:
 ROV (BOAT) - Sonar sensor with screen on it that has an ethernet port meant for sharing data between sensor modules (rx+,rx-,tx+,tx-), there is no video out connection.
 Base Station (PC) - Standard laptop
 The aim is to "share" the screen from the sensor onboard the ROV to the laptop so you can view the sonar graphs live rather than just rely on data which is collected on a sd card. A solution would be to use 4G routers at both ends and use VPN tunnelling to create a link. I think I will be able to use VLC streaming to gain access to the sensor screen from the base station laptop (I have seen someone make this work). However, I am not sure on the exact configurations and settings required Networking/LAN is really something i have no idea about I'm an electrical/aerospace engineer, so this is alien to me.
 Could I for example connect the sensor to a 4g router (TP link Wireless AC750) with an RJ45 cable and have a usb 4G modem connected (prepaid/postpaid 4G). Have the same setup on the base station with the laptop and using a VPN gain connection between them? I think this is called site to site IPsec VPN correct me if I'm wrong, it's quite confusing for me I have even heard the term DMZ host and not sure which to use. Or alternatively would a ubiquity Bullet AC work this uses their AirMax Protocol (based on TDMA) WiFi whihc has great range with the right antenna.
 Also, as a side topic, if the above were correct, can I connect 2 devices (sonar, onboard pc) to the same router onboard so that they share the same network. Is it possible to use that network to get the sonar screen live and at the same time use something like tightVNC to gain access to the onboard pc remotely from the base station? if they are all on the same network/LAN it should be possible they would just have different IP addresses?
 Thanks for the replies in advance I really appreciate it.

 ​
 I'm trying to get our printers to be able to authenticate to my NPS server. We already have our clients and IP-Phones working using certificates, but I can't get the printers to work.
 This is the printers' configuration page (HP LaserJet M605):

 I have no clue what Password/Username to enter. I've tried using an AD-User, but that doesn't work.
 Any Ideas? 
 Thanks!

 Shared files in computer management on the file server show the file(s) in question open multiple multiple multiple times but they’re not open by anyone in reality. 
 Rebooted the file server and the sql server overnight but it has solved absolutely nothing.

 My question is about GPUs, as their tasks will also be moderately expensive on GPU ressources. Previously i had difficulties working with GPUs on a Proxmox Server and VMs. In my opinion Proxmox is not really made for piping through GPUs into VMs and i dont know if you can even split GPU ressources to multiple VMS. On the other hand Proxmox is low cost and i am already familiar with it but it does not seem like the best platform for this use case
 Which Virtualization platform or Operating System does make sense for this task? 
 Would it make more sense to have dedicated GPUs for every VM or is it easy to split ressources?

His second choice was the Xiaomi 12 - even though I mentioned several times that it's a bad option if you are looking for a "safe" option - he bought it and returned it to me after 12 hours. He does not like it because there are a lot of "Accepting things for Data Privacy" pop-ups. Also, Apple is unfortunately not an accepted option at all. So, we are looking for an Android phone.

 It's goin to be a scenario with IS-IS as IGP and iBGP, so i need info mainly on point-to-point interfaces and loopback ones. 
 I've found everything on the internet which says both use and don't use RFC1918, so I'd like a bit of first hand experience by you guys, thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone. 
 I'm working for a small company with nine employees, which doesn't have that many requirements concerning hosting - a super-plain, no-frills, static site with medium traffic. For some reason, the hosting provider (a small local company) we've been using so far sent a notification that they're raising the price starting next month without any rational explanation. 
 My employer isn't happy about that and asked me to look into another hosting service. He's one kind of miser that would rather hang himself than pay an extra $40 a month without a reasonable justification (I get panic attacks when I remember the circles of hell I went through to get a raise a few months back).
 For the last few days, I've been looking into all these Hosting Services Compared, trying to find something that would suit my boss's financial requirements and, at the same time, would provide quality service. While researching, it hit me that I could open my own company and make some extra cash each month. 
 I know a couple of similar companies (with some I worked in the past) that work with the same hosting, and I imagine they also aren't happy with the price increase. I don't think that it would be hard convincing them to switch to my service. 
 I talked with a fellow friend who works in a hosting company today. But instead of sharing any advice, he tried talking me out of this, saying that it'll be a pain in the ass and not worth even trying because it'll be hard to compete with the giants that have a ton of employees.
 I'd really appreciate it if someone here who runs or has owned a small hosting business could share their experience. I'm particularly interested in the potential income, pitfalls, and problems that may await me if I decide to go on with the idea. 
 Thanks in advance for your help.

 On an IX, why would I start peering with other ASNs, if both of us already connect to the official route servers? I already know all their routes, only thing changing would be I learn them twice. 
 Possible explanations I came up with:
 - Stability - we are no longer dependent on the availability of the route servers
 - Security - I can specifically choose which routes I allow from peer X 
 On the other hand:
 - Managing peering with a lot of peers creates extra work, extra (duplicate) routes

 The new error that is appearing is:

 Remote computer: [redacted]
 This could be due to an expired password.
 RDP into a local account works.
 RDP into a domain account does not work.
 Domain user is set to local admin and both administrators and Remote Desktop Users are authorized.
 There is no password reset flag on the account.
 Confirmed firewall is allowing RDP on local network.

 I have looked around for a solution and am unable to find one that works. Any thoughts?

 Hoping for any insight that could be provided.
 A few weeks ago we turned on our tamper protection setting for most devices.
 I am making some security changes today and it seems the changes aren't applying properly due to tamper protection. So I decided to disable it until devices had synced the changes and applied them.
 However upon trying to change the policy to "Off" instead of "On" in Intune, all I get is errors. Similarly now switching back from "Off" to "On" produces the same error.
 Tamper Protection Blob
 Error Code 65000
 Error Type 2
 All devices are linked to MDE through the 365 portal.
 I can't help but shake the feeling this is some side-effect of MS recently linking the Intune security policies into the Defender 365 Admin centre.
 Does anyone have any suggestions?
 I've been at this for 4 hours please send help.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Sorry, dumb question, in my Cisco router, static routes usually have a next hop ip of a device in a directly connected network, eg if my router R1 has an interface with an ip of 10.1.1.1, I might see this static route in R1: ip route 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.1.1.2 Where 10.1.1.2 is the ip of a directly connected different Cisco router (R2). Is it possible for this next hop ip address to be NOT directly connected to R1? Eg could R1 hypothetically have a static route like this: ip route 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0 8.8.8.8 (I know it’s Google dns, I’m just using it as an example of an ip out on the internet). Would R1 actually send the traffic to 8.8.8.8 despite it being not directly connected to R1? Thanks.

 We got a request today from a client wanting an audit of thier printers. To have all the drivers checked to ensure they are up to date.
 Printers are instaled on a print server and they are mapped via intune.
 At a first glance it seems straight forward enought to check all the printers one by one to see what driver is installed. But even then, there is nothing signifying the driver "version". In the printer properties it just specifies the driver bieng used no version/dates at all
 The other thing is, Printing is working fine across all printers. Why do they need to be updated?
 How would you all tackle this? Would you just for the sake get the latests driver for each printer and update all the drivers anyways?
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA["I currently have four ISP paths to the same networks, all of which are advertised via BGP to my firewalls (Checkpoint Gaia r81.10). These consist of two clusters, one located at each site. The BGP configuration is functioning correctly without any issues.
 However, when these routes are redistributed into OSPF (Cisco), problems arise. Everything operates as expected until we start conducting failover tests. We sequentially disconnect ISP routers 1 through 3 in an attempt to force traffic through each router along the path. When we reach router 4, everything still continues to function properly.
 The issue emerges when router 1 is reconnected. As soon as this happens, it immediately expects, via BGP, that the traffic will be routed through it. However, the OSPF routing table has not been updated at this point and is still pointing towards router 4. This creates a black hole, as the routes are expected to come from router 4 via OSPF, but from the perspective of BGP, router 1 is now online.
 The underlying problem is that router 4 never lost its link state since it still owns the routes (OSPF).
 I hope I have managed to clearly explain this complex scenario. If anyone can shed light on how to resolve this issue, please do reach out. If there is something incorrect with my configuration, I am open to suggestions. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey all,
 I work for an MSP, there are pros and cons as there are at any job.
 At this MSP, we get paid anywhere between 30-50% more than the average industry salary but it comes with cons, we can manage anywhere from 3-5 projects at once and change projects on a monthly/bi-monthly basis or can extend for anywhere up to a year. 
 Some projects are great where others aren’t, ranging from free range cloud computing through different providers, cyber sec to writing compliance documentation day in and out.
 There is always something new to learn and study up on.
 So the question is, would you do it?

If I'm running Office365 Semi-Annual Channel Extended, am I affected by this vulnerability?
  
...and this comment in the Mitigations section:
  
Customers who use Microsoft Defender for Office are protected
  
...further implying a specific link between this exploit and Office.
 however, one of the application names in the list they provide is Wordpad.exe, and that would seem to imply that this is not, in fact, strictly an Office exploit.
 to my knowledge, wordpad is included with every single recent version of Windows (maybe excepting those N/S/E stripped-down versions)... but, again, all the discussion i've seen is calling this an Office issue.
 has there been any further information/guidance regarding this CVE? is this actually just an "everybody -- including home users -- needs to apply this mitigation" sort of thing? i just haven't been hearing that in press/blogs/etc.

 We have 2 service providers in our network which are connected to 2 different switches. ISP 1 is just connected to Switch A and ISP 2 is connected to Switch B. The ports connected on the Switches are configured on different VLANs for each ISP. The switches are then connected to firewalls in HA.
 So it's like, ISP 1 --> Switch A --> FW 1 And ISP 2 --> Switch B --> FW 2
 Switch A is just connected to Fw 1 on 2 ports which are configured on corresponding VLANs for each ISP and same connection is on Switch B just connecting to Fw 2 on 2 ports.
 We are trying to set up internet using 2nd ISP but I am unable to ping it's gateway from either of the firewalls. If we connect a cable directly from the ISP box, we get internet.
 I am not sure where the issue is, can you please help?
 Thanks

 So can all 3 controllers be behind dynamic nat on a firewall? Or do they each need to be 1to1 static nat?
 What I'm trying to understand is what are the public IP requirements to bring up all three controllers on Prem.

 Given that everything is in the cloud and SaaS for an example office network discussed here, what are the best practices for their firewall and network security? 1 GBit/s WAN uplink (one IPV4 address and a /64), no local servers, no printers, just wired computers and ip phones and wireless smartphones and tablets.
 Is a hardware firewall really needed or a packet filter between LAN and WAN sufficient? Basically, can such a not very large company use a consumer/home user router (with a standard stateful packet filter rejecting incoming new connections, passing through all established connections) or are there security considerations for business-grade hardware? (Things like dual wan not needed or simply solved by having spare of the same router hardware as it’s cheap).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi! Many mobile devices connect via both cellular and wifi, but don’t even need a local DNS anymore, just an IP and a default route. All traffic goes to cloud servers anyway (let’s ignore services like AirDrop for now).
 When designing a primitive wifi network (PoE switch and # wireless APs) solely for smartphones and tablets (no IoT, let’s say a guest wifi in a hotel or library), how does it improve security (overall and for individual devices) to firewall (packet filter or hardware) compared to just directly connecting the network to the internet (fiber uplink, just setting a default route to the switch’s SFP+ WAN interface)?
 Client isolation (everybody can just access WAN, not nearby clients) can be a security improvement (hotel wifi) or disadvantage (school wifi), but how about incoming connections?
 Because when the mobile devices leave the wifi, they anyway could be vulnerable via cellular (some mobile ISPs deploy public addresses also on IPv4, smartphone is directly reachable=vulnerable from the world). The wifi basically is just to bypass the expensive cellular interface and bridge the devices via cheap wifi in this scenario.
  
Is it necessary to consider VLANs if clients are isolated and only access the WAN/cloud? Eg. one ESSID+VLAN for staff and guests on their own ESSID+VLAN? Does it really have security improvements?
  
Any ideas or best practices for such a wifi scenario?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a Dell N3024f connected to a Dell N2048p stack using DAC cables now, but on the N3024f side I have been using the two 10g SFP+ ports. I've got some networking changes coming down the pipe and I need to move this connection on the N3024f side to a couple of the SFP 1G ports (Gi1/0/1-24). The SFP+ DAC cables I've been using won't work (in theory, and in practice, I tried them..) between SFP and SFP+ ports.
 What's the right DAC cable (or right kind of cable)? Due to the switches being a bit on the old side (I know..) I'm getting a fair amount of conflicting information about whether it's possible at all or what DAC cables might work? It seems like some people have backwards compatibility luck connecting SFP and SFP+ ports with DAC cables (provided the SFP+ side is locked 1G speed), but its not clear how much of this is the cable or what type of cable or whether it's some kind of vendor specific thing.
 I could always just use a couple of the N2048p copper ports to the N3024f RJ combo ports and be done with it, but the N2048p side is pretty full and I'd like to not lose usable access ports in the process. Another alternative option is using optics between the switches or 1G RJ45 ports on the N2048p side to the combo ports on the 3024f side.
 But DAC cables would overall be a better setup -- less parts, etc, but its not clear it will work or the cables for it to work even exist.

 I a FortiNet guy but have now been tasked with some ASA stuff. One of the tasks is to update AnyConnect form 4.3 to 4.10.
 Reading the documentation we can do this via the ASA using ADSM and the update will get pushed out when the end users connects but someone has told me that if the versions are too far out then it has be done manually. Is this the case or can i go from 4.3 to 4.10 without any issues?

I just need a script I can run periodically to grab things like phone numbers, titles, reporting managers, and update that info in Azure.
 I find it disappointing to say the lease that this functionality isn't built right in to the BambooHR platform.

 I need your help on this one.... I have 2 digital signage installation that use 3 monitors each. So total 2 USFF computers and 6 x 43 inches monitors. The problem is that when the power is back after a power outtage, the computers boot faster than the monitors. So the multi screen settings are messed up and I have to mamually reactivate the monitors, redo the settings and reboot the conputers.
 I wanted to use a PDU02IP from Startech, but the delay function does not work on power back after an outtage.
 There no option in the BIOS to delay the power on.
 Di you have any suggestion?

 Clicking ok won't fix it, allthough it does remove permissions added manually to the policy-folder (was curious if it does anything at all).
 Probably my predecessors tempered with it somehow but we can't check back on that. 
 The sysvol seems fine to me, as the inheritance is not active and permissions applied look at least somewhat reasonable (filepermission.jpg) but looking at the gpo-permission I get the feeling that it should'nt be so much. I suspect said predecessors once activated inheritance on those 2 policies, as they get all those permissions from the top level. 
 So on the one hand I'd really like to resolve this inconsistency and on the other hand ask about if the top level should really have THAT much in its permissions (gpo_permission_X.jpg). 
 As it is the default domain policy I backed off just resetting the permissions to prevent breaking something that actually works as it doesn't seem to produce any problems currently.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[i have an ISC2 CC exam on monday and i understand the basics of encryption, but just trying to nail down its affects on CIA & AAA.
 1) so if the sender "S" wants to send an encrypted message to the receiver "R" they would encrypt the message with R's public key, so only R can open it with R's private key - i can only find information stating that this is purely for confidentiality (because the message is encrypted) but would it also be for Integrity because it cant be decrypted and modified by anyone else but R? 
 i ask this because the other method where S encrypts a message with S's private key and send its to R to decrypt with S's public key its known for authentication and Non-repudiation (because you know it only came from S) and integrity (because if it was intercepted, decrypted, modified and reencrypted by the attacker and sent to R then it wouldn't be decryptable with S's public key). so why isn't the first method the same and known for its integrity? if anything isn't the first method more accurate? 
 on a separate question i understand this second method is bad for confidentiality (because anyone can decrypt the message with S's public key), but good for integrity - so what is the point of hashing? if S did encrypt a hash digest to the message, the message can still be intercepted, decrypted, modified, reencrypted by the attacker and sent to R but would result in a hash mismatch, the same way the second method's wouldnt be decryptable with S's public key.
 If hashing is just a 100% sure fire way to know the message hasn't been modified, why is the second method also known for integrity? 
 sorry, long question. thank you for any advice

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Evening folks.
 This is really bugging the hell out of me. We have a bunch of DL's here, and we would rather like to leverage our CA to give said DL's certificates.
 I wrote a powershell script that, using the HPE powershell commandlets, will generate a CSR, acquire the PEM from said CA, and install the certificate to iLO.
 However, it's a bit clunky and requires us to do... Well, something.
 I know there's a bug in 2.72, which most of the DL's are on, but I updated a couple to 2.92, and here I am still scratching my head.
 Automatic certificate enrollment seems to ask for the following information;
  
Server URL - As far as I can tell this is the FQDN for our certificate server, and the appropriate /certsrv/mscep_admin/. This is the only URL that it accepts that I've tried.
 
Challenge password - No problem, retrieved from that URL.
 
 *CA Certificate - Here, I start to scratch my head. The NDES page offers a thumbprint, and no certificate. I cannot find this thumbprint associated with any certificate. I have, however, tried teh CA root certificate. I have also, out of morbid curiosity, tried the PEM certificate I generated via certreq.
 It errors out, and tells me to check basically all the settings and DNS.
 I'm not a CA whizz, so I feel like I've missed something along the way. Someone before my time set this CA server up, and anyone I've asked internally has been perplexed as to why it doesn't work too.
 Does anyone have any thoughts on what I've missed?

 Hope you can help.
 We have an Sr.exec who insists on using LAN when at his desk (even though we have a banging Meraki Wifi setup that everyone else is more than happy to use) - and uses Wifi when moving to meeting rooms etc.
 His issue is that browser/office365 sessions timeout as he moves from LAN to WLAN or vice versa.
 We use Forcepoint web proxy client on Windows laptops.
 He insists on using Chrome which I'm sure is the cause of his issues as it caches Proxy, DNS and Sockets via chrome://net-internals.
 ​
 He is adamant that he should be able to switch from LAN to WLAN at will and have all sessions continue seamlessly.
 Has anyone managed to implement this? 
 Any tips on how? Any products used?
 (am thinking perhaps always-on-VPN that gives the client a single fixed VPN IP regardless of connection type.....)

 Thanks for any advice!

 We cannot find any relevant outages related to Microsoft services. We saw this, but it's not a perfect match for what we're seeing.
 It's still little fuzzy, I'm tired and might not have the details right. A few things seem to fix it.
 - Choose Settings => Mail Accounts => Clark Hill and click on Re-enter Password. This doesn't work for everyone.
 - Oddly enough, some users we can't fix any other way are fixed simply by downloading and logging into Microsoft Authenticator. That's it, you don't need to actually use it for MFA.
 We think the issue might be related to the newest Company portal app version (5.2307.0) failing to pass long registration attributes. Anyone else running into anything like this? I feel like we're actually having two different problems at the same time. This came out of the blue, and I find it hard to believe 'it's just us'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All! 
 I currently am part of a small team of 3 IT people at my company of 400+ staff. My company is currently using Google Workspace as our main identity provider however we also have M365 accounts. We are also using AzureAD for our laptop sign as well as Intune. My IT manager has tasked me with federating our M365 with our Google Workspace accounts which is all fine and well. We have tested this functionality and our staff are succesfully signing into their M365 accounts with Google. However as a result of changing our auth to federation, our test staff are unable to sign into their laptops anymore. 
 I have looked online and have not found any concrete evidence on if it is possible for staff to sign into their laptops (that are bound to Intune) with their Google accounts. Does anyone have expierence with this and know if it is possible or not? If it is, please could you share any resources you have on this. I did discover the Google Credential Provider for Windows (GCPW) during my investigation but have so far have had some strange inconsistencies with it where some of our tests users are able to use it and seeminly log into the enviroment but Intune has not behaved or they haven't been able to login at all. 
 We may fully migrate our identity provider to AzureAD in the future however at this point in time, our small team of 3 people doesn't have capacity for this. We're a fully remote company so we want to make the process to signing into company machines as smooth as possible whilst also reducing security issues (2FA is mandated for our Google Accounts) by reducing the use of passwords as much as possible. 
 Thank you all for your time! I really apprecite it.

 I'm quite the novice in Azure AD (Entra ID my ass) so please, bear with me - my terminology is surely off. 
 So our org disabled the "Stay Signed In" checkbox some time late last year. However I have realized, that people who've chosen this before (in web apps for example) still do not need to re-authenticate, the tokens / cookies still seem to be valid. (Which, in a way, makes sense).
 Now I assume to revoke all sessions for all users could fix this, but is there any way to do this a little less "broad" (as in: find out who this "affected" by this and address only these users)?
 Cheers!

 My question is for anyone whos' done this
  
Can this be done during normal business hours or should it be done in a maintenance window?
 I'm moving this off the one DC (needs to be retired) to two existing DC's that talk to all of our other DC's in our environment is there any gotchas i should watch out for?

 Wow!
 All kind of weird characters. So I plugged in USB keyboard. That kind of worked. Got to the desktop, opened up Notepad, just went across the keyboard. Holy crap, this thing is f**ked!
 Opened up Settings->Keyboard->Install New Language. (English UK)
 Same result.
 No water damage, hasn't been dropped. Next step is maybe swap out the drive?
 Have any of you experienced this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, 
 I'm working on some AV systems with heavy bandwidth usage on many multicast streams (~10gig per stream) and I'm weighing up the benefits and drawbacks of extending the fabric with either switch stacking or just LAGG uplinks in some topology or another. It is my understanding that stacked switches will flood all their multicast traffic between all stack members as they're logically one switch which is a drawback. 
 However, my question is - will links between stack members automatically loadbalance traffic (so 3 x 10gig fibers becomes 30gig link) - or do you need to setup the stack and then put your stack links into a LAGG effectively meaning you have the same limitations of a LAGG when doing a stack i.e. same limit of number of switchports that can participate in the LAGG.
 If they loadbalance automatically, is the load balancing performed via a different method that would make one method more efficient at loadbalancing i.e. layer 2 or layer 3 hashing?
 I'm aware this will vary depending on the chip used in the switch but any info regardless of switch brand & model would be useful, particularly Netgear m4300 range.
 ​
 One additional bonus question whilst I'm at it - is there any difference in the efficiency of loadbalancing when comparing a static LAGG vs dynamic (LACP)? 
 ​
 Many thanks

 I work for an MSP and the load of the moment is monumental, Technical debt coming out of our eyeballs, around 4 major projects going, and many many more "minor" projects. Reports are maddening and the firefighting is non stop. Like a lot of people, I'm feeling really burnt out.
 I've been toying with the idea of getting my Prince2 and moving into project management, as my experience has taught me most PMs don't actually seem to have any real technical knowledge, and it could give me quite an advantage.
 The idea of starting a project, working it, closing it down and just moving on to the next seems quite appealing. I'm aware of the stress of time constraints, but to be honest I'm dealing with tons of those now as the TAM anyway.
 I'm wondering if anyone here as made the move and what their experience has been of going from a tech to a PM working in the tech field?

 I have heard many things about this adapter, but not only bad ones, some in my company are absolutely in love with them, so I bought one for testing. So far it is set up and FW is up to date. But I have this one problem.
 From every computer I have tested, the first connection works within seconds, but if you disconnect and reconnect, I get an "error, try again" on my TV. I don't have to do anything, W10 keeps trying to connect and on its second attempt it works (ca. 15s of waiting). If I cancel when I get the error, and reconnect manually, I get the error again. It only works if i let the laptop reconnect by itself.
 As I said, this only happens if the laptop was already connected once. If I restart the laptop I can repeat the whole thing, susccessful on the first try, error on the second.
 Huh?
 Has anybody experienced this?
 PS: I don't have the adapter on my inhouse wi-fi, it's a direct connection.

I've observed via Wireshark, and see that my laptop sends a DHCP-Discover packet, but never receives a DHCP-Offer packet. I've asked IT and they showed me that the DHCP-Server sends the DHCP-Offer packet. Also, when he plugs his laptop into the same port that i tried, DHCP works for him.
 I've disabled the Windows firewall, tried broadcast/unicast DHCP and also tried another switch.
 What could be causing that i dont receive DHCP-Offer packets?

 Just wondering if anyone knows if there is a roadmap for Microsoft deprecating OOB flows for OAuth, like those with this redirect Uri: urn:ietf:eg:oauth:2.0:oob
 We publish a desktop app using this flow, and don't want to get caught out when it gets dropped.
 I note that Google have already stopped supporting this.

 I had a quick google, and couldn't get a definitive answer.

 If the GPO is configured with a network path - is the client accessing/downloading the screensaver from this location each time the screen saver is activated?
 Or is there a cache that works in the background somewhere? 
 I suspect its the first option, seen some increase in traffic recently which looks like its linked to a change in the screensaver to a much larger file.

It still does it's job, but support have ended years ago, runs on ESXi 6.7 (that's the newest supported version), some VMs where maybe 2-3 are critical (no cloud possible). My only concern is security - how can I be sure, that old virtual fabric switches are not vulnerable, the firmware is not obsolete, etc.
 What is the reason I should replace this hardware? Let's assume you need to explain this to management.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello Community,
 regarding nowadays security threats we recently had a discussion about whether clicking a link (for example in an e-mail) once can be even harmful or if there is always a follow up action needed, like providing credentials, clicking another link etc
 From my point of view i would say the clickrate on links in e-mails is very high, but not every "clicker" does follow the actual instructions so when it comes to user training i think it is equally important to focus on the potential scenarios after the webpage has opened, rather to only tell them not to click "any" link in an e-mail
 What are your thoughts about this, and which attack scenarios do exist where you already fell into the actual trap by only clicking (lets imagine, you do have an active o365 session in your webbrowser)
 Thanks

With the ongoing shift to Azure AD from AD (currently we're still hybrid) I was wanting to decommission on-prem mail-enabled securiy/dist groups in favour of using the email addresses attached to 365 groups.
 What would be the best way to go about this? For mail-enabled security groups I was hoping to just disable the 'distribution' component of the groups so that they no longer have an email address, and just add that email address as an alias to the relevant 365 group.
 Should 365 groups be used for email groups? Or should I be setting up distribution lists in Azure AD? Anything I should be concerned about in this change?

 Does anyone have any experience with how the migration works with Dropbox or Google Drive? Since it's just really updating the existing profile, all the downloaded files for those apps would still be there. I understand that passwords do not migrate due to new user credentials in the new profile (makes sense) and will have to be re-entered. So, once that is done is Dropbox (for example) smart enough to realize allt he files are there instead of resyncing?
 ​
 On another note, how do apps like Adobe with cloud licensing migrate? OR do they have to be re-registered?
 ​
 Curious on any experience anyone has. AND, if there is a BETTER TOOL than ForensiT we're open to suggestions!

These switches I do not have control of other than unplugging and plugging in cables but over the years the room has become a rats nest due to other people not knowing how to properly manage cables. Including the original installers since it's across 2 racks and using 3-5 meter cables with zero documentation.
 I have to get new computers onto our network (as well as document current computers switch/port) but need to tell our network team which switch and port it's plugged into for them to open the port for that MAC address. Ideally I would like to just use a command line or something simple but thinking of using the wands, however when researching which one to get I saw that some people were having issues using them on managed switches so before I go wasting money thought best to ask the experts.
 For context, I work in a building that has multiple groups all using the same infrastructure and the IT guy for my group with full permission to be in the room, however there are others who also do the IT for their group with same permissions. The network team look after the switches remotely but unless you tell them the specific switch and port they don't want to help, even if you provide them with the MAC address to look up they still want visual confirmation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. Due to life changes, I decided to leave a job at a nonprofit that I’ve greatly enjoyed both the job and the purpose of the organization. I’ve been there many years and was the sole IT person for about 100 people. 
 We hired the only person who applied and he seemed underqualified but it could work. I planned my exit to work with him for a couple weeks and bring him up to speed. Something seemed off with him and I just realized today that it seems like he’s just going to use this gig to pad his resume. By itself wouldn’t be a huge concern but he’s planning some massive projects that will cost thousands of dollars that could otherwise be spent on the actual purpose of the org. Meanwhile he’s not considering some specific projects I’ve suggested that had been pushed back due to Covid and other restraints but certain outdated equipment is becoming a liability… just not a sexy project. 
 One project is upgrading the network to 10g when we barely make a dent in our 200mbps internet bandwidth. He’s done no research with staff or historical network usage to justify any of these projects. Unfortunately, no one else in the org understands IT and I’m not sure anyone will question these frivolous upgrades. 
 I’m debating whether or not I should bring this up with my former boss but I don’t want to get into a pissing match. I truly value the organization and the people there and it’s frustrating to see things going this route. 
 My thought would be to bring up my concerns and coach on what questions to ask. Basically why do we need this upgrade? What problem does it solve? And what data to look for as a justification. 
 Thoughts?

 I found a youtube video where someone used a AC Infinity CLOUDLINE T6 fan to vent such a room through an intake register installed in the ceiling. The intake register connects to the fan, in the attic, and then the fan exhausts to the intake of the AC system for the property. Our local HVAC technician told me that it was a bad idea to have hot air running to the property intake when the system was not engaged, (actively cooling). I assumed he was right, but I could use a second opinion. 
 That being the case, I think I need an AC unit devoted to this room. I already have a 6" intake grille installed in the ceiling and a 6" vent installed in the ceiling that I can redirect to a new AC system. Is this what I really need? What AC system can I get for such a small space?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we have 2 sites that are connected via dark fiber (10 Gig link) , on both sites we are using a Cisco 3850 switch. Dark fiber is being terminated on these switches in both sites.
 The routing is simple with a /30 mask being used and no ip switchport being configured on each dark fiber port on each switch. EIGRP is being used for routing.
 We use Solarwinds to monitor these devices.
 Now the problem is we are suddenly seeing issues on this dark fiber link starting today, was working fine until yesterday (last week there was a fiber cut which caused interruptions but has been working fine until yesterday since the fix). The port keeps flapping randomly every 30 minutes or so. Will go down for a few minutes say like 3 or 10 minutes at a time and will come back up.
 We opened a ticket with Comcast (dark fiber is from Comcast) and they sent someone to check the their equipment. He came checked within 15 minutes and determined it wasn't an issue on their end then got an email from them saying that it could be an issue with sfps/bad jumpers.
 Now upon checking on solarwinds I see a bunch of receive errors today not necessarily coinciding with the flapping but I do see them. It's about 10-18k received errors (only receive) on one of the switches (haven't put the other 3850 switch into monitoring yet) and this was today. Until yesterday the received errors were just 198-200 or so.
 So could this be an sfp issue on this particular port? Could swapping out this 10Gig sfp fix the issue? Or could it be a different issue?
 Thank you.

 For example, if I wanted to run a test of a rate-limit config on a given device and I decided to use iperf, I would need to physically connect a device with at least two NICs (or two different devices) to act as the client and server for the iperf test. The device I run iperf on would then generate the traffic for the test on one NIC and receive the traffic on the other NIC.
 If that's correct, then it would logically follow that people often use servers - or any other computer with multiple NICs - to generate the traffic with their traffic generator of choice (…]]></summary>

I've traced the cables and they appear to have connectivity, what could be happening?
 Anything helps!
 Originally we thought we had a switch go out but now I don't think so u wanna say it's dhcp but when I look on firewall we don't have that many wired devices and wireless are on a separate address range. So what could be interrupting between the second and third switch?

We've disable IDS, bounced the server/firewall/modem etc, and still get the message in the screenshot. However, there is one computer on the network that can access the site - using Chrome on the VMHost. Tried it in internet explorer on the VMHost - no joy. And no joy anywhere else. The database is generally accessible to the whole internet. DB provider swears they are not blocking our public IP. I've switched the DNS forwarder on the DC to use Cloudflare (1.1.1.1) I'm out of ideas, and the inter webs have no information on the source of this block message - I literally cannot find anything in google that tells me the source of it. Any ideas? Here's a link to the screenshot: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wqn-1f57tppBIc1823tTakRjj9tv82fi/view?usp=share\_link

 The HP 2610 is a 10/100 (gross I know) and Aruba is gig.
 I added a new VLAN to the 2610 for management (VLAN 50), tagged it on the HP's fiber uplink, then untagged it on the switchport I'm using to uplink to the Aruba 6000.
 The corresponding Aruba switchport is configured as an access port on VLAN 50. 
 As soon as I uplink them together, the HP freaks out and losses internet connectivity across the switch which is on VLAN 1.
 I also tried configuring the Aruba uplink port as a trunk with native vlan 50. 
 If I tag VLAN 50 and untag VLAN 1 on the HP, the switches work fine together. 
 I tested turning on loop-protect on the HP, which did not get triggered during my testing.
 It almost seems as though a broadcast storm is coming from the Aruba when the HP port in configured with an untagged VLAN 50 and connected to Aruba 6000. 
 I've also tried changing switch ports on both switches and changing auto-negotiate. 
 Any thoughts?

 My work has me settings up large specialized computers which all need a connection to the network for an initial data configurations. Too often the staging area provided to me has inadequate ethernet available.

 the process falls apart from a management standpoint of how to deal with repeat, habitual "clickers" . They've asked me to provide input, but i'm running out of options. cant really limit internet use or email flow, usb is already disabled. It appears that the managers talking to the employees isnt helping much either.
 trying to figure out what other methods you may have to used to reduce the security "fail" score of specific employees!

Second, to help commercial customers plan, we’re sharing that Microsoft 365 Copilot will be priced at $30 per user
  
So, for orgs using Microsoft 365 E3, to leverage Copilot you'll be doubling your license spend per month per user who gets it. This is an awful price point.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! Long story short, the place i work for needs me to install a program called VeriAdmin from a company called bioscrypt, that manages fingerprints stores in a fingerprint scanner from the same comapny. The only issue is that Bioscrypt doesnt exist anymore, and after calling the company that absorbed them, i was told that they dont have that software anymore. Checking online, and there are no downloads of this software either (i did find one called secureadmin by the same company but its not the same software sadly)
 Anyways, we have one windows 10 computer where that software is installed and works on, but its due to be retired next week. i've tried to transfer over all the files, including the .dll's and the registry keys from the working computer to a new one, but in the process of being transferred over to a flash drive, it immediatly loses some data, since the exe loses its icon and any information about it in properties. Despite this i try to run it on the new computer and it simply wont run either in compat mode, as administrator etc. 
 I ran procmonitor on the computer where it works and on the newer one to see what could be missing, and apparently, right after trying to QueryNameInfo a DLL thats stored in system32, it fails on the new computer, because on the new computer right after it starts a registry key named "windows error reporting", while on the old one it just continues with opening the HKCU registry key. 
 I checked the DLL and theyre the exact same, with the same permissions, and everything else the same. Im not sure that this is the exact issue with the software, maybe something happens after it runs that DLL that doesnt show up on procmonitor, but if anyone could help me figure this out i would be very grateful. here is a screenshot of the procmonitor logs and i show where it fails (the new pc is on the left, the old one on the right): https://imgur.com/a/pVhHaQC
 again if anyone can help i would greatly appreciate it! thank you!

 I once deleted the entire badge reader database of whom was able to access a set of offices. That weekend I had to stay close to the office so I could help people get into the office by re-adding them to the database.
 The 2nd thing I did (LONG ago) was replacing a router and did a command similar to this:
 ip route 172.31.10.0 255.255.255.0 S0/1
 The problem - it was the wrong interface on the router. Should have been:
 ip route 172.31.10.0 255.255.255.0 S0/0
 All Internet traffic failed and while it took me only 5 minutes to realize that there was a problem and find my stupid error. How did I fix it? Swapped the cable from s0/1 to s0/0. I didn't want to take a chance on fixing the configuration and break something else!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Audio engineer looking for advice from networking engineer professionals. As the audio more and more relies on IP networks, I find myself seeking for advice from fellow network engineers. This time it is not directly connected to audio, only control of it. 
 I have this mixing console, that can be controlled via lan from iPad app. Although most of console manufacturers let us connect many iPads simultaneously, this particular manufacturer provides access from only one iPad at a time (limited via software), which is very unconventional. Is there a way to bypass this limitation using router? 
 My idea is that multiple iPads connect to router via wifi (wlan). 
 Router acts as a bridge (between wlan and eth) and routes traffic trough eth to mixing console. All outgoing eth traffic should come to console from same IP. 
 Console returns response trough eth to router.
 Router makes the response in to multicast and transmits it over bridged network to wlan for all wifi devices.
 ​
 Does this makes any sense? If so, could someone please get me on track on how to start googling it.
 Thank you!

 How would you go about moving them? 
 The racks wheels are supposed to be rated to handle a full rack load and still work with no issue, so I thought just unhook everything from the other racks wrap up the loose cables lock the rack and start walking. 
 Or should we go through the hassle of undoing all cables, removing everything then reassembling at the new location?

 I posted last night but deleted, needing a rethink of my question.
 I work for a very large government organisation, with several hundred thousand users and specifically oversee Exchange Hybrid and Exchange Online. We have a majority of our users in Exchange Online.
 We have a heap of projects lined up, with a few years worth of jobs. However, they're all 'keep the lights on' jobs - and I'd like to educate and inspire the masses to do more.
 I'd really like to start taking ideas to the business on how to innovate, whether it's with Graph API, Flow, Power Automate, Teams or 3rd Party Addons. Even Outlook feature, or Outlook on the Web. Mobile client features? 
 I'm after some ideas of what people have done in their companies that people have found to have made a difference, or how you've 'inspired' development of 'solutions' using Exchange Online. Do you do training seminars?
 Essentially, I want to provide people with solutions to problems they didn't know they had. I just don't want to keep the lights on - I'd like to do more! (Even if it is with an old behemoth of a platform)
 Cheers!

 They already host their own DNS for their primary domain, and want me to move the DNS on-prem.
 Thing is... I've never setup DNS from scratch.
 I added A records to the GoDaddy DNS.I added the server public IPs and host names in the Hostnames section of GoDaddy DNS. The configured Nameservers are still GoDaddy's.
 At this point, the FQDN of the servers resolve to the correct IPs, but GoDaddy is still the source of the records.
 Next, I changed the Nameservers to the FQDN of the clients servers (same as already in DNS above). After an hour or so, the domain completely disappears from the internet.
 So, what am I doing wrong?

 Very often we have to create VMs from scratch instead of templates which is very frustrating. Also we are missing a convenient way to backup our VMs which is why we are thinking about using vCenter.
 Would it be advisable to run vCenter on a VM inside the existing ESXi host or is this not something we should be doing? If so, why? I'm also thinking here about another hypervisor that we might want to deploy in the future.

We've had this config for at least 10 years without issue. I know we should probably have local DNS servers at each site :( . Suddenly from remote sites we cannot ping DNS names but we can ping IP. DNS server IP is reachable but not by name. No issue at HQ, all DNS names resolve server.domain.local. DNS server logs are clean and it has been rebooted. Rebooting workstations or typing ipconfig/flushdns resolves the issue but only until the next morning when it starts again. Last week when it first started there was a single occurrence at one site. I found some old DNS records on our DNS server from a time when we had a different local subnet in a different building so DNS server had conflicting IP info and I deleted the old records which resolved the issue for 1 week. Now it's back. Could it be a firewall issue? Not making any progress troubleshooting so far.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I use the APCRBC123 battery with my SMT750RMI2U and it just died on me this week. I'm looking to replace it with a third party battery if possible as the APC batteries are over-priced.
 After doing some research I've seen a lot of people suggesting third party batteries for UPS. My model apparently uses a proprietary connector which I have from the old battery pack: https://imgur.com/a/YOWLqmC
 Will I be able to connect 7Ah 12v third party batteries to this? My UPS model supports hot-swap so I'm assuming I connect the third party batteries to the connector and plug-in as normal. I want to be 100% sure so I'm not wasting my time. I've never had to replace a UPS battery until now.
 If I can buy third party batteries what are the best brands (I'm in the U.K), or does this not matter?

 But after I checked the VM currently installed (yes should've done that first) and I saw that they had 1 extra VM that 'Wasn't legit' they were licensed for 6 Windows server 2019 and they had 7, so I said well the windows server 2022 2 pack will cover the 2019 and the extra 2022, but then I wasn't sure if it would work.
 ​
 So my questions is
 Since licences are usually downgrable
  
Am I fine audit wise with the 2 pack Windows 2022 saying that 1 will be used for the 2019 and one for the 2022
 Do I need if it's possible to separate my 2 pack and downgrade one code to 2019?
 Do I need to upgrade one of my 2019 to 2022 to be legit
  
Thanks

For little bit of background: Workload is about 8 vms including a 2019 windows fileserver for mainly CAD related files. We have around 35 Users, all on premise. Budget is tight...
 My plan so far would be: 2* custom build servers ( with 5 year next-day onsite support): 2HE with 8 * hotswap bays Supermicro h12ssl-i mainboard Epyc 7343 cpu with 256gb ram 2* 240 sata ssd for os 5* 3,8tb sata ssd for storage 10gbit dual-port intel nic for cluster/vsan network Those would be around 8500$ each
 Starwind vSAN to replace the MSA and replicate Storage between the nodes.
 Question is this feasible? Use hardware raid 5 ( with a broadcom megaraid 9560-8i) for the local storage or maybe storage spaces instead? Is storage space parity mode still bad ?

 We would like to set up their EntraID admin-accounts with WHfB on the same device, to log into entra.microsoft.com with WHfB - so they can choose with which account they log into the microsoft service - does anybody if and how this is possible?

 Before I joined, it was decided to block all USB keys. When someone wants to recover files, I have to unblock them through our MSP (because I don't have yet control of the AV but that's another story).
 This makes sense to me because USB keys are still a large vector for viruses, however it's taking me at least twice a week to unlock some ports after I checked the key myself on a separate isolated machine.
 I would need your input regarding this. What makes sense to you regarding USB keys : should they be completely blocked, what process do you have in place ?

I tried creating a virtual network using hyper-V, but no luck there either. Apparently not many people do this, because google is worthless (or I'm not searching the right thing since I'm new to this) I'm just trying to figure out how to simulate some SNP devices for testing network monitoring software. I'll take any method that people have had success with.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 Our company is considering migrating our email and IT tools to Microsoft 365. Currently, we use our own servers for email, but we would like to transfer the domain to Microsoft. Additionally, for certain users, we are purchasing Microsoft 365 Apps for Business licenses, including Office apps, etc. We currently have 35 such users, but during the migration, we will need around 50 users immediately, and within a year, the number may exceed 100 as we expand into international markets (we already have open companies in Spain, Portugal, Austria, Poland, etc.).
 As the company is present in multiple markets, the plan is to have all admin.microsoft processes executed in the main company, while in foreign countries, there will be the option to only add/remove users with licenses.
 For optimal operation, we would require a plan similar to what Microsoft 365 Business Standard offers at €11.70 per license/month. I'm wondering if you have any other suggestions for optimizing the company's operations with this number of users?
 Additional questions:
 What is the management principle for "aliases" on Microsoft servers? Are aliases free?
 In the case of a business relationship, do they provide training for administrators, and do they offer technical support in case of any issues?
 Thank you for your assistance and looking forward to your responses.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello guys,
 ​
 I'm a web / mobile developer, and on my current contract, my client ask me to prepare a quite huge setup, in a domain I'm not expert in, let me explain.
 ​
 The constraints of the app are:
 - We need 1 dedidacted server by country we implement the app, with it's own independent database, with a lot of limitation because it's for medical purpose (that's why we need 1 server per country). So each server must have the same version of the back-end.
 - We need to extract some data's from each server to make them anonymous and build worldwide stats, which needs to be accessible for any user.
 For the first point, I was thinking of simply open new VPS on a given country, and just deploy the last stable version of the backend, and link all of them across our DNS. But i'm not sure if it's a good practice to have only 1 DNS server for people who want's to access a server far from the DNS ? Don't really know how does it works actually.
 For the 2nd point, i was thinking about a kind of proxy server, that put itself between the country server and the client, that will collect the anonymous data and store it in a separate database, and then duplicate and sync this server in the cloud to make it available all around the world ?
 ​
 My issues concern the stack i should use to make this kind of setup. My knowledge stop to NGINX, Docker & Node.js to be quick, and that seems to involve more complicated stuff, so if you can point me to some docs and/or softwares that would works for my purpose ?
 ​
 Thanks guys

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So at the moment I have OneDrive for Business - On my laptop and I have folders setup to be shared to specific users in the business. All computers use 2FA login and disk encryption btw. This works great as most people are remote and it all syncs and works as it should. We used a NAS in the past, but it was slow over the VPN and just wasn't the right solution.
 The problem I've got now is as users add into their shared folders, it saves a copy on my PC, which means I need to upgrade my storage. I'd rather not do that and need to look at an alternative way of doing things with OneDrive.
 One option I looked at was the plugin for our QNAP NAS called Hybrid Backup Sync. Does anyone know if this will do what I need - basically move all of the files from my OneDrive onto the NAS, and then share the folders etc that way (through OneDrive still)? Keeping my PC free of files that only I need etc.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Unfortunately, PostgreSQL is not very well implemented in working with temporary tables. Even when a temporary table is very small and can be processed exclusively in memory, PostgreSQL creates one or more files for each such table. And this happens even at each TRUNCATE of a temporary table. 
 However, PostgreSQL allows you to create all temporary tables in a separate tablespace, which allows you to move all the files to a separate disk. As a result we have : 
  
A separate disk that has exactly one folder that holds 500K files at all times.
 Of these 500K files, 99% of the files are either empty or less than 16K in size.
 There is constant active creation and deletion of new files.
 Reliability is completely unimportant. At any time you can delete the entire contents of the disk and re-create an empty folder.
  
At the moment we use ext4 file system. Even a simple reading of the list of files in a folder can take 1-2 seconds. When analyzing with the perf utility, a lot of time is spent on ext4_lookup, ext4_create.
 Which file system is best suited for this task ?

 2cpu, 16GB Ram. 
 Random failures. Usually mondays of course. Found a few driver mismatches, fixed. Random fails still happening. Most drivers are type 3. Some are older drivers which I suspect to be the main issue. 
 My inclination is to build new 2022 server similar specs, all type 4 drivers if available. We already pretty heavily use universal drivers for HP, Canon, Ricoh, other big names. Still have some model specific drivers for the smaller brands. 
 Thoughts? Managed print via printer logic or azure not really an option yet.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just got bit by this - CrowdStrike pushed out a new update today to some of our Falcon deployments. Our security team handles these so I wasn't privy to it.
 All I know is, half of our production MSSQL hosts and clusters started crashing at the same time today.
 I tracked it down after rebooting into safe mode and noticing that Falcon had an install date of today.
 The BSOD Error we were seeing was: DRIVER_OVERRAN_STACK_BUFFER
 I was able to work around this by removing the folder C:\Windows\System32\drivers\CrowdStrike
 Contacted CrowdStrike support and they said they were aware an update had been having issues and were rolling it back. 
 Not all of our systems were impacts but a few big ones were hit and it's really messed up my night.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm about to replace a 5 year old Windows 10 Dell Optiplex that was used as a file server for a small business. They are a design firm with 12 employees with ~1.3tb of used storage. This would be my first server replacement and would appreciate some feedback. The existing servers were installed by their previous IT vendor and i'm looking for some recommendations on how to go about this upgrade.
 Their current setup:
  
Domain Controller - Windows Server 2016 (planning to replace after the file server)
 Used for very basic AD functions and DNS. Pretty much just used for creating users and authenticating them to the domain, no complex policies or in depth configurations.
 File Server - Dell Optiplex, Windows 10, 8gb ram, single 4tb hard drive (NO raid /facepalm)
  
I am looking to replace both machines, starting with the file server. The budget is about $3,000 for each machine. Their are a design firm and use Revvit / Autocad, thus cloud solutions are not viable, they store the projects on the file server and access them in office, beyond that its a very simple setup.
 This is what i'm looking at for the file server:
 Dell PowerEdge R250 / T150 Tower
  
Windows Server Essential 2022
 Intel Xeon E-2334
 16GB / 32GB RAM
 2x 4TB enterprise SSD - Raid 1 for data
 512GB SSD for OS
 10GB network card
  
Does this look ok? Are SSDs overkill for this? I'm thinking of purchasing the basic ram/HD options from Dell and purchasing upgraded ram & hard drives for the items listed above since Dells upgrade prices are pretty significant. I want to set them up for success and considering they are using a consumer Dell PC with Windows 10 for their file server, anything would be an upgrade to their current setup.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have several wireless captures taken with my Aircheck G3 that gives me access to capture all of the frames being sent on a channel, including management and control frames.
 I am intending to determine the amount of airtime that beacons are consuming. From the captures, I already know that about 40% of the frames captured are beacons, but I want to determine how much actual airtime this corresponds to.
 I know beacons are transmitted at the slowest mandatory data rate, and I know the frame size. But I don't think the airtime calculation is as simple as the frame size divided by the data rate (with the appropriate unit conversions between bytes and Mbps, of course), because I know the bits can be packed into higher MCS indexes / QAM encodings. (Or, am I thinking about this backwards, whereas a 24 Mbps data rate is the what you get at a fixed MCS / QAM?)
 So, in summary - with access to the PHY and MAC layers from an 802.11 capture, can I calculate airtime consumed for each frame? Or is there not enough info in a frame?
 This is in an 802.11ax network, btw, and I know it can get even more tricky with OFDMA's resource unit allocations, which I don't see any evidence of in the frame dumps.

 Is the RTG concept just a Juniper thing? I tried to look it up quickly and see if there was anything out there for the term in Cisco land or otherwise and didn't find a whole lot. I have never heard of it before today. 
 Does anyone actually use that over STP? I'm trying to figure out why anyone ever actually would do so. If you are using RTG instead of STP, can you tell me why please?

Is there a best way to start configuring ? from the last switch or start from the first switch connected to my router ?
 Best practices for avoid get kicked and need to be in the place connected over rs232 ?
 I will be configuring the switch over the same port whose will be the trunk port. I need to change the port to trunk and put the new management vlan. Can i do this without being disconnected ? or it's better to stay with mgmt vlan on 1 and then make the change ?

 Bricking printers when CC expires. WTF we need to boycott this company
 My personal experience after running into so many bricked HPs printers many years ago was to put it on a vlan with no internet access. Amazingly those HP printers did not brick themselves. This was many many years ago and they may have changed to where if it can’t phone home it might just auto brick. 
 The only good HP product I used was Nimble and that’s not even an HP product, they just bought them out.

My primary service providers are Hostwinds and DigitalOcean, along with nodes at customer sites.

In addition, I want to connect our office network to this cloud network, and tinc is not readily available in most commercial firewall solutions.
 I have been looking into Netmaker which seems promising with its incredible transfer speed but I’m keen to hear your opinions about this. I like ZeroTier which works well despite dynamic IPs but I’m concerned with its speed as I continue to scale up. 
 IPSec is another alternative, but to be honest, I am not sure if this is the right solution either. I suspect someone has done something similar, and if so, I would really appreciate any expertise you could share with me.

 Did "a simple RAM upgrade" on a customers server
 Turns out the server was a ticking time bomb. Some other consulting company had come in there and installed a bunch of garbage on the Hyper-V host directly that was murdering the performance and preventing the VMs from starting on boot.
 I sure do love cleaning up someone else mess!
 DC booted up with a disconnected network adapter and was in safe mode, so no DNS or DHCP for the rest of the network. None of the services on the app servers or SQL would start properly.
 3 hours later the VMs finally finished booting up in a healthy state and got their evening shift able to work.
 Then we had to stay up till 2am working remotely to fix their backups, patch woefully out of date servers, upgrade the RAM of the VMs to fix a nasty paging issue, fixed underlying storage issues, etc etc
 What a mess
 Glad we got the customer in a better state now, but "there's no such thing as a quick 20 minute upgrade on a Friday"

 Looking at two options for new network hardware for a customer. Want to add a bit of possibilites on top of just getting internet access. Multiple (tens) of branch offices.
 Solution option 1 is FortiGate on each branch office, and also on HQ. They can then connect them with tunnels and whatnot as use-cases appear. It's a desentralized solution which I do like. Nothing needing user-licensing is also just nice. Possibilites are quite grand.
 Solution option 2 is Cisco Secure Access SASE with Meraki gear. It's a centralized solution, which means all branch traffic is piped through there. I read there's some 250 Mbps limits pr connection, which scares me, and it's a lot "younger" solution (but does that mean it's still immature?). Licensing is ofc worse, being Cisco. It does however bring a very centralized management as it's all centralized.
 Does anybody have good (or bad) experience with this Cisco, Meraki, Umbrella mash-up? Would love to hear your 2 cents. I'm very familiar with Forti, no experience on Meraki.
 The use-case is first and foremost internet connectivity, then adding on some security (web filter etc), and then possibly adding some centralized service from HQ (interconnecting to a partner or publishing a private app or server for instance).

 So we have a quite old machine that runs on our factory floor that has been there for about 30 years. Within the past two months, I have been replacing Cisco 1142APs with 2802Es to great effect. However, this machine, even though it is wired with Cat 5 ethernet is reporting errors between the differing modules. The techs have been replacing the ethernet cables, but still seem to think that the newly placed APs are the cause of this interference/collisions, as these cables tend to be home runs in the ceiling. I currently have the closest 2802E AP set to power level 1 - would turning this down potentially help?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Sysadmins,
 I'm sure this is a quarterly question in this forum and I've been reading some other threads as well, but wanted to see if there is anything new out there.
 We are investigating options to move from our DFS servers which are nearing OS EOL and in general they need to be reworked since they were built with 15 year old best practices. We current have multiple DFS servers in different geographical offices that replicate using DFS-R and then we use a software called PeerLock to handle file locking within the replication groups. This has been pretty solid but our initiatives are to move to cloud-based services. Whether it's SharePoint, Azure File Services, Egnyte or something else, that's yet to be determined.
 Some other info - 100% Windows clients, having mobile app access would be a plus, but not a requirement. Whether mapped drive or sync client is fine, we will need our users to rework files since we have an Excel linking problem, sheets linking to sheets, to sheets, to sheets, back to original sheet, and more sheets. Total storage need would be 15 TB initially. We also have folder overrun so we would definitely run into length issues in a SharePoint.
 I'm wondering what folks have turned to as their next version of file services in distributed offices that is as cloud-first as possible and what issues, caveats, or reviews you have.
 Thanks!

AWS is 0.023 per GB and it seems that BackBlaze is a lot cheaper. We do not need any of the big bells and whistles. We need to be able to use the AWS S3 commands to send files to aws and every so often download them as needed. Would BackBlaze be enough? Any replace their S3 storage with BB? I want to avoid minimum fee's like Wassabi since we mostly keep files for under 30 days.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 We are currently using the Cisco ASR920 -12CZ for our edge routers with BGP, we just peer with default routes and they've been fine, but end of security support.
 According to Cisco the Catalyst 8200 or 8300 is the successor to this product. We just got a quote for the C8300-1N1S-4T2X as this has 10G ports for future upgrades. It's wildy more expensive then I imagined, 6k euro a piece with 5k support per device (8x5 nbd on-site).
 The 8200(L) series is much more afordable, but no redundant power and the NM supports a single 10G port which seems awkward. Might just go for the cheapest single-gig model and budget for the 10G model when we get there.
 Are there decently priced alternatives without going into UBNT Edgerouter territory with full support?

 I have the activities as "Reset user password" and "Change user password" and I have the user set as our emergency account. I've tried multiple times to both reset it and change it but I'm not getting any alerts for it. I have set up an alert for when the account logs in, so I know that it at least partially works..
 Has anyone had similar troubles with setting up alerts? Any solutions?
 Thanks !

 They stated cleaning up the old mailboxes would be a small project, taking their techs about 4 hours. I asked for permission to do it myself and did it in 2 minutes on the exchange admin portal?
 I filtered by shared and deleted the shared mailboxes that I had confirmed staff no longer needed prior to requesting this, and literally checked down a list and deleted them all at once.
 Am I missing something? Was this a 4-hour project?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My understanding is that using SMS as your 2-factor makes you vulnerable to "SIM swapping" but a hacker in possession would still need both your login and your password. If you've been SIM swapped, you would know it immediately because your phone would stop working. This is a quick alert for you to take action.
 So, they need three (or two if you think about it) things: your SMS, and your login/password. That's not so easy, and if you safeguard both, you should be fine............ right?????? 
 Banks nowadays also don't make it easy for hackers.

In the last 1-2 months all our users lost their Calendar one by one. As of now, no one has their calendar in teams anymore. We didnt change anything in our config in the last few months. Im a bit at a loss atm and would really appreciate some new input. Things i already did: O365 Support (useless) Mircosoft paid Exchange Server Support(still ongoing, seems equally useless atm.) All the Microsoft threads regarding Teams Calendar troubleshooting. The connection test from Microsoft. Its telling me it cant reach the mailbox. Same in the Teams logs:
 "userPropertiesSettings": { "value": { "mailboxDiscoverableStatus": "Undiscoverable", "autodiscoverSettings": { "ews": { "mailboxStatus": "Undiscoverable" }, "rest": { "mailboxStatus": "Undiscoverable", "mailboxDiscoverabilityError": { "errorCode": "CalendarEventsFetchFailed", "errorMessage": "Could not fetch calendar events from the user exchange mailbox endpoint retuned by AutoDV2.", "exceptionMessage": "Failed to execute Office365 backend request GetCalendarViewRequest_User. Request Method: GET, Response Status Code: Unauthorized, Response Error Code: , Response Error Message: ", "protocolType": "REST" } } }, "exchangeRecipientType": "MailUser"
 I dont know how i can tell Teams how to reach the exchange on premise mailbox.
 Teams is our only affected service. Everything else works perfectly fine. My current thinking: We dont synchronise the Mailbox GUID through Azure AD Connect so Teams thinks the user does not have a mailbox and stops looking. But shouldnt the autodiscover refer the Teams Mailbox inquiry towards our exchange server?
 Would really appreciate some new directions where i can look :(

 Been WFH since March 2020. I work for a huge company within the financial services industry. Having some frustrating/peculiar tech issues. 
 TL,DR: Can't log into my work's system, nor several other sites, like Hulu, from my (secure) WiFi network at home. However, I CAN log into my work's system and Hulu when using my Mobile Hotspot. I had zero issues on Friday, no hiccups. When I went to try both sites yesterday, neither worked. I should (hopefully) be fine using my Hotspot for the day, but obviously I can't/don't want to be using my Hotspot indefinitely. There was a very brief power outage over the weekend in my house (IDK if it affected my whole town or neighborhood, or if it was just my house), but everything came back on within like ~30 seconds. I doubt that had anything to do with it, but IDK. 
 Thoughts? Ideas? Recommendations? Any DIY troubleshooting I can try? I've submitted a support ticket for my work-side, but IDK how much they'll be able to help, since I'm technically still able to access their network from my HotSpot, i.e. I doubt they are the root cause of the issue. Thank you in advance for any feedback or guidance.

 Does anyone have any scripts to reset the MDM assignment within Windows?
 Really want to avoid going to 140 devices to do this via the GUI.

 I am a junior sysadmin at a small company. At the moment, we are running on prem windows servers, and have to restart them every weekend, so theiy would make updates (i am planning with Linux and VM services). 
 Unfortunately, the windows server 2016 sometimes is not in reach with ping and other services are technically running on the server, but won't come through to the clients. But remote access is still working.
 Any idea where this problem could come from? Should I restart the AD at another time? The AD is also on prem, in the same subnet.

 I have senders getting messages rejected quite often now, even though we have the "correct" email setup (dkim/dmarc etc) and other domains that are non Gmail are fine. The issue I face is that not everyone has an email administrator at their disposal and some small companies have zero clue in how to add an accepted domain.

 We are a small team of 10 people, and the only thing left at the MSP is our file server with Veeam backup and a print server running (with Universal Print connector).
 I was first told that it would be shutting down later this year, so I haven't really prepared anything.
 However, I need to find and setup a new solution within the next two weeks. But what is the best option? We are used to having network drives pinned, and I have no experience with Sharepoint. To my understanding, Sharepoint shouldn't be treated as a file server, but I might be wrong.
 What is the best solution? A local file server with local or online backup? Sharepoint? something else?
 We all have AADJ devices and are running Intune, and we only have around 300 GB data.
 Thanks in advance!

 It's time for the annual inventory of the IT's hardware again.
 I'm in a organization with ~200 users. Since last year more than 50% of it was upgraded into new specs and I didn't took note every time I deployed one (yep, my bad). The previous IT guy used CPU-Z in each of the user's unit then jotted it down then compile it which I think will take a little bit of time. I now wonder if you use any software like Advanced IP Scanner but for the hardware-side monitoring or should I prepare myself to go to each and every one of them users.
 Thank you y'all.

 Now I'd like to set up the storage servers in a failover configuration as well, but I'm unable to get it working. The main problem I'm having is I can't get any shared storage (the iSCSI vhdx) from either of the storage servers showing in the failover cluster manager, so I'm unable to create the new iSCSI Target Cluster role.
 I tried following this guide: https://www.informaticar.net/create-iscsi-target-cluster-on-windows-server-2019/ but keep running into different issues. Either the iSCSI vhdx from the second storage server doesn't show up, or when I add the node to the cluster it says there's no cluster group name etc. 
 Does anyone have experience with this? I find almost all resources about this online are lacking in information.

 The issue is, there is a lot of macros coded to save files to specific folders on this server. I am not myself an expert on this subject of macros so I kindly ask for you assistance.
 When I update the server, will the macros break, or is there any way they will stay working if I can create the new server with exactly the same name? 
 I would have love to shut down this server entirely since I already moved most of it to the cloud, the only reason it's still hanging is because of the macros.

 Any Riverbed Steelconnect peeps about?
 I'm currently migrating an SDWAN away from the legacy Steelconnect platform and have an Azure instance. Before I try to un-deploy I'm wanting to confirm that "un-deploy" will not remove my VNET it is attached to? As I believe this would result in VMs attached to the VNET needing to be re-deployed...
 My gut says no it won't, that would be stupid, but I've seen enough stupid decisions in deployment wizards in my time to want confirmation... :)
 I've looked into the deployment doc and as far as un-deploy goes it just mentions it will kick off a confirmation, but not what the process will actually remove. As I was not the one to deploy, and it was deployed in 2020, I'm not 100% sure whether it created the vNET or not. I can confirm the Enterprise app has "owner" permissions on it however.

 My company is migrating from Trellix ETP to Microsoft ATP/EOP Spam Filter. I have an exchange hybrid instance and all my mailboxes are in the cloud. I've reviewed the documentation below and I'm stumped about what to do with the inbound connector:

 It says to enable "Enhanced Filtering" on my existing inbound "Partner" ETP connector. That's all well and good if I'm keeping ETP but I'm not. So the connector will stop working when I update my MX records.
 Apparently Exchange Online can just receive external emails without needing an inbound connector? Has anyone dealt with this situation before?
 I'm extremely need to Microsoft ATP/EOP Spam Filter so be gentle ;)

 I tried to shrink the vhdx via the hyperv feature resize-vhd (i also had to shrink the used size of the vhdx via diskpart) . This works when i attach the vhdx via diskpart - i tested it with a skrink from 30GB to 10GB. But when i loged in with that user the VHDX size is still 30GB.
 I copied the vhdx to the right place and also deleted the proxy and cache folder for this user.
 ​
 I also know the solution with frx.exe, but this isn't the best solution for me because of the broken permissions.
 ​
 Does anyone has an idea how i can shrink the vhdx with hyperv so that fslogix show the correct size?
 ​
 This would help me a lot
 Thanks

 It's supposed to prompt for a User/Pass when you connect but it doesn't prompt and just goes straight to trying to connect and then "Can't connect to this network"
 I tried multiple driver versions and I tried manually adding the network with WPA2 enterprise auth and nothing seems to work.

 I don't think the issue is from the network, it's from the laptops and I'm not sure why

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I was told by a senior network engineer it is not an issue, but I am not convinced and hope to get a second opinion. The issue is we have intermittent very slow connection between a client and a server. It traverses a Palo Alto and a Checkpoint firewall. My layman eyes naturally focussed on the frequent 2-3 RSTs sent in quick succession. What's more, 2 of the RSTs have the same sequence number, and that sequence number was also seen in a FIN/ACK packet just sent, as well as Acked' in another FIN ACK... ie
 ​
 443 -> 696969 [FIN, ACK] Seq=5202 Ack=6666
 696969 -> 443 [FIN, ACK] Seq=6666 Ack=5171
 443 -> 696969 [ACK] Seq=5203 Ack=6667
 696969 -> 443 [RST] Seq=6666
 696969 -> 443 [RST] Seq=6667
 696969 -> 443 [RST] Seq=6666
 ​
 Do you think I am on to something, as in this is clear indication the firewall is messing and/or dropping packets? Even then, I dont understand why the sequence number is reused for both FIN and RST. Any insight is greatly appreciated.

 EDIT: Forgot to mention, there's load balancers as well.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello,
 I have kind of a strange issue:
 I have setup a few site to site IKEv2 IPSec tunnels with a few Cisco router. 
 Settings: SHA512/AES256/DH-group20 for both P1 and P2.
 The tunnel establishes just fine, and everything works as expected (HTTPS/ICMP/TCP etc). Until the timeout is reached and its prepared for a rekey.
 Now with it being an IKEv2 tunnel PFS is only enabled upon the first re-key of the tunnel. Once this rekey happens, TCP traffic seems to stop working. Ping/Traceroute all seem to work fine. 
 I don't understand why PFS is adding that much overhead to the Packet. As if I set the DF bit to clear, the packets are fragmented and TCP connections work fine again. So this is leading me to some kind of MTU/MSS issue.
 I tested a ping from R1-->R2 (without fragmentation) and the most I can get through before PFS is enabled is 1280 bytes, after PFS is enabled the max I can go is 1150 (alot of overhead being added to the pack which is strange). Which is an extremely small size (in my opinion) to set the max TCP-mss to.
 Now im waiting for someone to give me a PCAP of the trouble router to find the optimal MSS/MTU size, hopefully the issue will be more present there. 
 I have a few sites working just fine with just ISAKMP/GRE/IPSEC setup. 
 Sorry I have been troubleshooting this for some time now. Just looking for any advice you can give. Or if anyone has had any similar experiences with IKEv2 and PFS (in p2)? 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Gentlemen,
 Not sure if this is the right place post this. As the title states, I have a interview soon with a fantastic company. I really want this job and I don't want to shit the bed. I am looking for some advice as far as prep work is concerned. I consider myself well spoken and think of my ability to interview not be an issue. I am worried about the technical aspect. Any help on what to brush up on or look out for would be greatly appreciated. Obviously I am aware that this is a very broad question and the interviewer can ask anything.
 Background: Years of IT support with some network admin experience thrown in. I currently have my CCNA, A+, Security + although it has been over a year since the exam.
 To give a little bit about the job posting without revealing too much. They are asking for on preferred qualifications, (experience in that niche field) which I have. CCNA which I have.
 Here is some of the technical listed.
 experience managing data networks with Cisco routers and switches
 experience configuring Cisco network equipment
 Palo Alto firewalls, F5 load balancing, Cisco 9000 series, and Cisco Nexus Platform
 I have been studying all week and brushing up on my CCNA material. But I wanted to come to my fellow reddit goers for any shared network engineer interview experiences that may guide me.
 If I am in the wrong place, Please let me know and I will promptly remove.
 God speed gentlemen.
 ​
 ​
 Edit: ** Wow! I was not expecting all the comments and support. 
 Thanks a lot guys! 
 This certainly has helped me feel better about the interview and the process moving forward. I will take all these ideas into consideration and apply them. 
 Much appreciated!

 I was updating the IP config to some PLCs (Logix 1769) when I accidentally set one of the PLCs to 0.0.0.X/24
 The only way except pulling it apart to go the serial route is to force a new IP through RsLogix
 Curiously we do have access to an Allen Bradley display where it would read modbus data if set to read from 0.0.0.X
 BootP is unfortunately disabled
 Question: is it possible to force a NIC in windows to 0.0.0.X/24 in any way, ignoring the reserved subnets?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm network consultant and was just working on a deal where a client was spending over $300k on server hardware. I quoted them out some nexus switches for like 30-40k and they were so offended by the price. Asked if they could just run cheap Ubiquiti switches instead. And they are planning on running ISCSI through these switches....
 Like for some reason systems engineers just don't understand how important switches are. I've seen people running low budget switches in data centers and it blows my mind how puzzled they are about the performance issues of their server stack. Like these switches have Like 1MB buffers... good luck dealing with burst flows ..
 Anyways people don't neglect your switches !

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am looking for a smart way to consistently track configuration changes on Linux systems. UseCases where I would find this incredibly helpful are when there are multiple admins in need to change configurations on a regular basis. This e.g. results in issues when a file was changed to a typo without copying it to a backup location first.
 I’ve thought about using Git but couldn’t really sympathize with the idea because of its complexity.
 How are you tackling the challenge? I figured for 90% of the use cases it would probably be sufficient to only track changes to certain files like .conf,.yml,.rules etc. Maybe there’s even a solution combining this into a linter for YAML, XML etc?

 The problem is we won't really have someone to take over that position and my company won't likely hire someone with the same experience due to cost.. 
 I love to learn but getting certs is not really applicable for me as I can't really retain knowledge without LOTS of practice,BUT studying them still helps.
 My company treats us VERY well and I want to be able to help if this happends. 
 When anything really serious goes down (clients drive gets deleted by an idiot(me and another tech when I was new 2 years ago) tech he worked all weekend to restore the whole server (veeam). Things like that we don't really have a good replacement for tech wise. 
 Where would be a good place to start, to start learning things like this so I could at least be able to help troubleshoot ideas to fix possible large issues? As long as I have basic understanding I can google and get it figured out, but as it stands I don't even have that. 
 Unfortunately this person beyond doesn't have time to train anyone and doesn't do well with dealing with less knowledgeable people as they don't have the nessisary social skills/patients for that, so asking them isn't really an option. 
 Any help will be much appreciated.

 Out setup was one server directly on the same switch/VLAN to bypass cisco godawful security. We could make our deployment even faster with 10GB Ethernet PCiCards and switch (deployment would then reach 10 min).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am a junior sysadmin. In the past I have repackaged some software using the WixToolset.
 A couple of months ago, the maker of ghostscript decided to remove their silent install switch which fucked up our SCCM packages. We can't get rid of ghostscript as it is integrated in a lot of our homemade software and management don't wanna pay for a corporate license.
 From what I can see, ghostscript is just a drop of files. It works flawlessly just compiling the source code and launching it from any location as long as the files and in the good directory.
 So I figured I could use the Wix Toolset to do just that but when I use the heat component which register my components together it just run for days without completing. 
 I am lost. I am NOT a programmer and programming is not my strenght...at all. I can script but thats it. Main sysadmin is pretty desperate to ask me and I might need some help. My approach is probably wrong. I tried but uncompress files (opening the exe with 7zip) and the binaries created from the source code but both do the same thing.
 There is about 600 files and directory combined for Wix to process. It's way more than what I am used to. Maybe thats the problem?
 For now, I used a repackager like Emco and it...kinda works but it's clunky and I don't trust it at all. I had a lot of issues in the past with it but when it works, it works. 
 I borrowed a licence from an a friend but its a one time deal.
 Anyone have an idea how to do this cleanly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey fellow network admins!
 I'm currently trying to figure out the best way to configure the following setup, and I could really use your expertise. I'm in charge of administering two Cisco routers, each equipped with 2 WAN ports and 4 LAN ports. One of the routers serves as the main router in an MPLS network, connected to the corporate network. The backup router connects the corporate network via DMVPN.
 Currently, the LAN is directly connected to both WAN routers, ensuring redundancy through HSRP and IP SLAs. However, we now want to introduce a firewall cluster between the LAN and the WAN, so that the LAN side is protected by the firewalls and the default gateways for the LAN networks reside on the firewall. To achieve this, we plan to establish a transit network between the Cisco routers and the firewall cluster.
 The customer's network are isolated from other customers using VRFs. We are currently utilizing MPBGP with iBGP for the LAN customer networks and OSPF for overlay purposes.
 Here's what we have implemented in the past so far: redundancy through OSPF with corresponding costs and a distribute list to only learn specific networks.
 I would greatly appreciate any suggestions or insights on how to achieve redundancy for the firewall cluster in the most straightforward manner. Are there any other methods or best practices you could recommend?
 Thanks in advance for your help!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow sysadmins,
 I’m currently managing a large number of cloud and on-premisses servers and am looking for an efficient and secure way to streamline my workflow. I’m particularly interested in a web-accessible system where I can visualize server states (resources, alerts, services, containers, etc.), access them via the web interface using SSH, and add new servers either directly or by installing an agent on the server.
 Moreover, considering security is paramount in our field, I’d highly value any tools that offer two-factor authentication (2FA).
 I’ve explored solutions like Cockpit Project, Webmin/Virtualmin, Rancher,.. but none have all features. While these tools offer several of the features I mentioned, I’d love to hear what you all are using and if there’s something out there that might better align with my needs.
 Could you kindly share your recommendations, experiences, or even potential custom solutions you might have developed? I appreciate any guidance.
 Thanks in advance!

 The situation as it stands I have two file servers. One for operations and one for C-level people. Each server has a drive on it for "IT documentation" since we have some IT that only services operations and some that only service C-Level. But there is a small group that has access to both so there is a security group that gives access to both drives. I am a member of this group and we are promoting a person so I added them to the security group (same group membership as I have).

 I was upgradeing 2960x switch that was master in a stack. It had two members, and one of the member upgraded successfully but the other one did not. Now when I type in “show switch” it says that one member is in stack but the other is not because of mismatch version. 
 I want to know what can I do to upgrade that switch that has mismatch version? Also, I want to know how can I found out IP address of that switch since the “show switch” only displays MAC address? Can I upgrade that switch just by connecting to it or is it possible to upgrade it only through the master in a stack?
 I dont have much experience in networking so this question may seem like a joke to someone, but I could really use some help.

 We would be using starlink as a main line of internet. Now, would it be adviceable to use AP or P2P to extend the wifi range to reach the wireless CCTVs? Each building cluster is like 30-50m apart from the main building where Starlink will be installed. The main building should also have a big screen to see all cctv feed. And should also have night vision. And accessible thru the internet casually
 Hope this gets some attention thank you

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I’m fairly new to fiber connections and I’m trying to figure out the right polarity when it comes to chaining multiple fiber connections. Basically I am connecting one switch to multiple patch panels and then to another switch. 
 Both switches will have LC to SC connections (LC at the switch). So basically it goes like this:
 LC (Switch) -> SC (Patch Panel) -> SC (Patch Panel) -> SC (Patch Panel) -> SC (Patch Panel) -> LC (Switch)
 I know its typically A to B connections for transferring and receiving but does it stay the same for the patch panel portion? Or does it repeatedly rotate? So would it be:
 A is left for LC -> A(top of SC) -> Same as previous SC -> Same as previous SC -> Same as previous SC -> B is left of LC.
 OR
 A is left for LC -> B(top of SC) -> A is top of SC -> B is top of SC -> A is top of SC -> B is left for LC

 I’m working on an “interactive” office layout that will show employee information based on the office selected by the user. I also had a thought to have a visual representation of departments by area. I’m able to get the individual offices to work as intended but once I create a bigger shape that will encompass all the smaller offices to represent the entire area of the department and then link that “department” shape to data I’m no longer able to select any of the office shapes nested within it.
 I can provide an image that might explain better if needed but essentially think of it as having a network switch diagram. You have each individual port linked to a dataset. However, when you then create the shape for the entire switch and link that to something you can no longer select the port links when published.

 I like Redmine, I've used it in a few jobs and I feel that it's alright for my daily use (small teams in small orgs).
 So I'm wondering if it would be a good tool to manage my personal projects (either sysadmin related or other stuff). I've always been disorganized for personal stuff, I know it's caused partly by executive dysfunction (ADD), I looked up thinks like the GTD method and other methods, they look good but I can't seem to apply them.
 Here are two examples of "projects" I've been working on for some time, but not completed :

 As the title says, I need to perform a drill on control system where a simulated attack will be witnessed by one of the users, it will be communicated according the Cyber Incident Response plan and so on, to ensure the procedure works fine and users are aware about how to handle such situations.
 Currently, I am thinking about scheduling a task to bring up an Image on the screen that would look like a Ransomware Attack or something similar.
 Can anyone please give some advice and tips on doing the same in a better way?
 Thank you for your time.

 Thank you to everyone who shared their wisdom and reassured me that using GPOs to manage workstations is acceptable. Currently, we do have some GPOs in place, such as password complexity and security policies. The disagreement lies in whether the domain GPO should govern workstation settings. I manually configure certain settings on the images, like disabling unnecessary programs and features, to minimize user errors. Some machines require specific configurations, such as setting Edge's homepage to our intranet. Ideally, I would like to rely on the domain to automate these configurations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I've only been managing the network in our organization for a few years now, but a phrase I'm very quickly getting tired of is "it's the network/Wi-Fi." Whenever I hear a vendor, colleague, or end user utter this, the odds are about 8/10 that it's never the case. I can appreciate how end users or even technicians without a good bit of knowledge in this area might reach that conclusion, but what baffles me is when knowledgable IT people come to this conclusion with absolutely no evidence or reason.
 A case in point would be a vendor I recently dealt with, they're very knowledgable in their area and probably have more years IT experience than I've been alive, but then it pivoted to that dreaded phrase. Through the course of troubleshooting, it became clear they had no idea how DHCP worked. Again, I understand how people can have specialized areas of knowledge, but how the fuck can you spend 3 decades supporting networked devices and have no idea how they receive IP addresses!?
 Even beyond that, so many trash apps immediately throw errors like "There's a problem with your Wi-Fi" when in reality, they are experiencing an outage. Sure, that might sound better to the end user, but it's completely wrong and sending them in the direction of troubleshooting something that's working perfectly fine. Are the devs really that lazy and incompetent that they can't try to ping some common external resources to determine that the network is functional? Or shit, at the very least add the word "might" in front of that rather than convey with absolute certainty that your shit app expertly diagnosed that your Wi-Fi is indeed broken.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Working for a small/medium sized business that is growing. And with each bit of growth the needs of the business expand. Often into areas that involve technology. But really, doesn't almost EVERYTHING involve technology now?
 So we've been having a lot of conversations about how and who should take on some of this stuff. I'm doing what I consider traditional IT stuff for them. Business wide systems. Laptops, servers, 365 and similar cloud services, basic support, etc. and I find myself saying this a lot... That isn't "IT." Things like data analysis, or application development, or trainings, or web design.
 And it occurred to me this really depends on how you define IT. I've worked at places where IT is one giant department that handles everything even tangentially related to technology. They are usually bureaucratic behemoths that everyone hates to deal with, but to each their own. And I've worked at places that decentralize this more. The communications department might handle websites, the analytics staff would handle data work, app development department builds apps, and an internal IT department does what I basically do.
 Curious how ya'll personally think about this and what your experience at different jobs has been. Is your IT department the kitchen sink department? Or are there specialized departments that handle different things, and if so, what is the department called that consists of admins and business wide support?

I’m mainly focusing on the DHCP issue at the moment because the roaming issue comes and goes by the DHCP issue is in every trace. The server that responds is the correct server. Is this possibly a setting on the clients? Has anybody seen anything like this?

 I'm having an issue with a shortcut I deploy via group policy. Its a shortcut to an exe on a mapped network drive. When the shortcut is executed, the program starts and a login window comes up. Problem is: the login window should be filled out (server address, user, password, database) but is empty. When I double click the exe its working as intended. When I create the shortcut manually (right click on exe > Send to > Desktop (create shortcut)), its working too.
 The software engineer told me the login window stays empty when it has no access to the ini file, which is located in the same folder as the exe. I could verify that, when I rename the ini file and execute the exe, the login window is empty.
 Anyone has an idea why and how to fix this?
 The program was made by a local software engineer, it doesnt need to be installed, but the exe needs Gupta Team Developer installed on the client, its a framework like .NET (I was told).
 Thanks!

 Experiencing a strange issue in my network environment. I have an x2 9500-16x switch in a VSS running as the core switch- Version 16.9.5. So the IP gateways of services are configured on SVIs on this switch. Lately, I started noticing heavy packet loss on pings destined for the SVIs on the switch. Below are my observation so far;
 Packet loss to the switch when running a ping test SSH traffic to the switch is very slow There are no CRC errors on the uplink. Traffic flowing through the switch has no issues. No packet loss to switches connecting to this core switch. No issue with data plane traffic yet. Now, i have looked at the system cpp policy and even increased the cpp-police-data rate to 800pps but didn't help. Am i looking at the right thing here has anyone experienced this issue and how did you manage to resolve it. Please advise

 I was told by a few people that Cisco doesn't actually load balance.

 Cisco appears to claim it can handle it better than the other guy so I don't know. Typically I have found Cisco to be more configurable than most other units. Popular opinion is that I am dead wrong on this one.
 So, Pepwave is out. Cisco might be out. What other quality unit might be able to handle a dual cellular (load balanced) Mexico configuration?
 I can't find a product list for silver-peak, to see which units would have dual cellular.

 To provide further context and to start clarifying what my approach is here is the lab design and requirement:
  
two branch DCs: DC1 and DC3
 central hub HUB
 DC1 connects to HUB, HUB connectd to DC3 - to get from DC1 to DC3 you have to go via HUB
 DC1 and DC3 have the DCx_SW (L3 switch), DCx_FW (firewall), DCx_Edge (WAN router)
 DC1 and DC3 have 3 zones LAN, DMZ, PROD
 DC1 LAN is 172.16.1.0/24, DMZ is 10.1.0.0/24, PROD is 192.168.1.0/24
 DC3 LAN is 172.16.3.0/24, DMZ is 10.1.0.0/24, PROD is 192.168.3.0/24 and 192.168.33.0/24
 each zone is a separate VRF on DCx_SW

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, this may not be the best sub for this, but I am looking for a remote desktop program for a friend to use over the following couple of weeks. He has a main desktop that he works off of, and a laptop, but all his files are on the desktop. While hes away, he needs a way to access everything on the desktop so he can continue working as he normally does. He mainly works with Word and Excel.
 I'm pretty alright with tech, so I'm not worried about figuring out how to utilize whatever you all recommend, but the last time I used a remote desktop software was about 10 years ago with teamviewer, and have no clue what people are using these days. I also don't know if that would work if no one is able to use the source computer, which is the case here. He needs full access to his main pc without anyone else's help.
 I also considered just literally downloading his entire harddrive onto a portable drive, and plugging into his laptop so he has all his files, but I'm not sure how big it is, or if this is even the best solution, so I come here asking you all. 
 Please lmk if you have any more questions and any recommendations as to what we should do. Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone!
 I am aware that this may be a controversial topic that has been discussed before, but some of the existing threads include arguments probably not of relevance any more (e.g., power consumption of first generation NICs) or do not apply in my specific scenario (e.g., no plans to change to 10Gbit/s switching). So here goes:
 We have a NAS (Synology DS1821+) which is used for central data storage via 1Gbit/s LAN to a multitude of users - there is no intent to change this. However, one of our servers needs access to a lot of data being stored on this server, which is why we thought to upgrade to 10Gbit for this single connection (going up to 25Gbit does not seem warranted since we use SATA drives in the NAS). The distance between server and NAS are just a few meters, so we would not need the benefits fiber provides in this area. Costs should be kept as low as reasonable.
 - Would you suggest copper or fiber in this context? 
 - We initially planned to use Mellanox ConnectX-4 on the server, but even off-brand copper SFP+ modules are way more expensive than I thought - on the contrary, the fiber version of synology's NICs are more expensive :D
 - We could also purchase a 10Gbit NIC for the server with RJ45: Do you recommend an Intel version? I have heard that Intel is leaving the networking market (but that may have been just for switches), so I am a little worried about long-term support. There are also versions of Intel NICs from different manufacturers (HP, DELL, etc.)...are these 100% compatible in any server (running Windows Server 2022) or just in servers of that manufacturer?
 Just let me know what you think :).

 For the past 2 years I've been working as a B2B contractor. I have 7 years overall experience and the certs to go for it (CCNA, CCNP + some Juniper ones too). 
 I'm curious how the B2B market for network engineers looks in the EU looks for you guys. Because to me, this market looks really weird. 
 On the one hand, there seem to be plenty of new positions open. On the other hand, even though I have the "open to work" tag on LinkedIn, I have one or two recruiters reaching out to me. Back during the Covid days, I got between 3-5 offers per week and I didn't even have the "open to work" tag. Even if I apply to positions (EU wide, looking for a digital nomad lifestyle), only 1-in-10 even comeback with an offer and their meaning of hybrid is relocation to their country. 
 What are your thoughts on this ? Bear market ? Is it getting better ? Is this the new normal ?

Some domains have one way some have two way transitive one has forest relationships. Others have no direct as trust relationships but use a 3rd party tool to effect the trust. 
 It's a 12000 seat org and the domains can loosely described as corp-dev-uat & special-dev-uat
 The members of the 'special' domain include potentially nefarious individuals. Can't elaborate further on that.
 Somehow in a fever dream I imagined it as a resource domain cascading out with appropriate trust relationships so the the nefarious individuals couldn't swim upstream permission or authentication wise. 
 I know it's possible, but it's likely a massive undertaking to do without tying something in knots and breaking it permission wise

Under the "Configure Ruby Environment" header near the top, I followed the instructions, but when I do the last step of "which ruby", it gives me /usr/bin/ruby, instead of the correct path /opt/chef-workstation/embedded/bin/ruby.I also exited the shell session and opened a new one, but it is still showind /usr/bin/ruby (edited)
 This guide walks you through the four parts to set up Chef Workstation on your computer.
 Configure Ruby Environment Set up your chef-repo for storing your cookbooks Set up Chef Credentials Verify Client-to-Server Communication Prerequisites Download and install Chef Workstation A running instance of Chef Infra Server or Hosted Chef Server.
 Also not sure if this is relevant, but when it says to
 echo 'eval "$(chef shell-init bash)"' >> ~/.bashrc
 I did that, but I noticed my .bashrc is only has eval "$(chef shell-init bash)". Does that mean I did not have a .bashrc file before that command, or at the very least it was an empty file?

 What I'm thinking I want for the flow is this:
 1. Make Google Workspace email
 2. Assign it a permission level
 3. Have it able to SSO to everything in the toolset via Keycloak and Caddy depending on permission level without needing to invite manually
 This should all be accessible via private VPN and for that I'm eyeballing Netmaker because wireguard go brrrr. 
 As far as I can tell I can use a mix of Workspace, LDAP, Keycloak, and Caddy to achieve a setup like this that allows provisioning permissions easily and SSO and that's what I'm sitting on right now. 
 Anyone got advice? Better practice or setup? Free knowledge?
 My first time having to do this and I'm learning on the fly, give it to be straight if I'm doing stupid shit.
 Thanks. :D

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi I currently have one of my interfaces for wireless set to 10.1.1.1/25 and will be changing to 10.1.1.1/24. I have three systems that are static that I will login to and change the subnet mask to /24 will this cause any issues to my network clients as the rest are DHCP so as it renews it will get the new subnet masks. Currently at /25 my gateway is to 10.1.1.1 and don't have anything beyond 10.1.1.20 
 Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today my "Security Admin" got a notification that one of our users laptops was infected with a virus. Proceeded to lock the user out of all systems (didn't disable the laptop just the user). 
 Eventually the user brings the laptop into the office to get scanned. The SA then goes to our Senior Network Admin and asks what to do with the laptop. Not knowing that there's an antivirus or what antivirus even is. After being informed to log into the computer and start the virus scan he brings the laptop closed back to the SNA again and says "The scan is going to take 6.5 hours it's 1pm, but we leave at 5".
 SNA replies "ok then just check it in the morning" 
 SA "So leave the computer unlocked overnight?!?!?" 
 SNA explains that it'll keep running while it's locked.
 Laptop starts to ring from a teams/zoom call and the SA looks absolutely baffled that the laptop is making noise when it's "off"
 SNA then has to explain that just because a lid is closed doesn't mean the computer is turned all the way off. 
 The SA has a BA in Cyber Security and doesn't know his ass from his head. How someone like this has managed to continue his position is baffling at this point.
 This is really only the tip of the iceberg as he stated he doesn't know what a zip file even does or why we block them just that "they're bad"
 We've attempted to train him, but absolutely nothing has stuck with him. Our manager refuses to get rid of him for the sheer fact that he doesn't want a vacancy in the role.

 Please add Department H Distro list to the Survey List for Region S.
 Done. Informed both parties, both are happy. Ticket closed.
 Ticket gets reopened with a new note: Hi Randall, it does not look like my (head of that dept Department H got a Survey that happened this morning. I have attached the survey email that should have been received. Please fix this ASAP as we can not miss these emails in our work flow and are needed for the weekly reports to the C Suite.
 Sounding kinda serious. Let me stop my youtube watching for a few minutes and look into. Message trace shows a consistent stream of surveys going to both sets of lists and being expanded out. All the titles are the same (Limit of the survey system supposedly, not my department to address). Well that sucks for looking for the email. Pull the message ID from the attached email. Update the search for just the message ID. There we go, much better details... and it shows as delivered to Dept H list and shows that the Dept Head also received the email. Grab the time stamp, ask the end user to confirm if they do or do not have the email from said time in their Outlook. 
 Head of Dept H: NO. You need to FIX THIS NOW!
 Me: Alright, maybe it got accidentally deleted, let me do a discovery search for this email. (The email is right in the inbox as it should be) Alright, I am showing it in your inbox at the time it should have been.
 Head of Dept: You are lying to me. I am going to the VP of IT
 Me: Feel free, but it is there (messaged VP and gave the heads up)
 10 minutes later...
 Head of Dept: ... I found it in my inbox at the time you said while on the phone with your VP. Please close this request.
 VP of IT: Yeah, that was a FAFO moment for them.
 Reminder, your IT department will have the receipts

Present day I am studying for my CCNA while I work my warehouse job that pays well and will give me the schedule I need to study. Now to my question, can anyone assist me in telling me what an entry level networking IT job would look like? I’m familiar with the roles of a Network engineer but that’s far away from where I’m at clearly. Just looking for the peoples word on what an Entry level Networking job would consist of or look like.

I'm having difficulty identifying the specific IP address or user responsible for consuming excessive bandwidth. Despite checking the Wi-Fi controller, there doesn't seem to be significant usage there. There are a few servers that have undergone DNAT (Destination Network Address Translation), but I'm uncertain if any of the publicly accessible IP addresses subjected to DNAT are consuming an excessive amount of bandwidth. Could you recommend the most effective monitoring tool to help me identify the source of this issue?

 I have some servers out in the field for work that are up and running and I need to schedule some firmware updates on them. I'd like to just use the Lifecycle Controller since it's more automated, but I'm wondering if there's a way to access it without having to reboot the server? Obviously I'll have to reboot once the updates are happening, but I wanted to hop into the LCC first to see what updates are available. I was even thinking if I could see there wasn't any major updates required I could just do some of them manually through iDRAC.
 Hopefully that all makes sense....

I actually had done this on a couple companies already. There was one I mildly entertained because I was interested on what they are offering but then I found a better one...told them I am no longer interested in the most kindest possible way. Few days later started sending multiple emails to my CxOs asking us to reconsider them and that they are emailing me and I'm not replying back? Like...really? Good thing my CxOs informed me right away so I took care of it the best way possible - blocked that Company's domain completely without remorse.

 I had a bit of a weird interaction today at work, I'm a developer and do a lot of DevOps. We have a guy from another team setting up some hardware for us that a load of docker containers will be hosted on. 
 I got chatting to him and he mentioned he had configured several IPs to the MAC address (he called them aliases but I think they're ARP cache settings?). As a more software oriented person, I asked what the advantages were compared to using a reverse proxy and didn't really have an answer. 
 From a configuration basis, are either inherently more secure/stable/expandable? 
 My initial instinct was it was going to create more work than setting up Nginx to handle the routing and ssl rather than doing it on every service, but that's just how I've seen it done before.

 Very often MDM can’t clear the passcode because the iPad requires Internet connection and they can’t connect to the internet because it’s locked which leads me to have iPad replaced. 
 I tried to configure the iPad as “Shared”, but it doesn’t work for us since Apple requires a shared iPad passcode after authentication via Azure AD lol. 
 The only solution I’m thinking of right now is to set up a passcode for the iPad which is the last 4 or 6 digits for the SN. What you guys think? Any other solutions?

I verified all of my locations all have the same settings on their gateways so I'm at a loss. anyone else experience this issue?

 i should mention this is using Cisco IRS4431 gateway, and connected to CUCM.

He said I already had my ADUC already open with my domain admin account. WTF? Locked out account can unlock accounts? Is there something I'm missing here? Delay? It was a good hour before we told him the cause and before the account was approved to be unlocked. Also, please no "should not be using domain admins blah blah."

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are going from traditional cisco wifi with 3 on-prem controllers, and enterprise RADIUS (user and certificate auth) to a fresh new meraki deployment.
 The 3 controllers are at 3 different sites, mostly for redundancy and licensing (only 25 licenses per controller).
 Each site is on their own subnet (10.150.1.x, 10.170.1.x, 10.180.1.x, etc) for the secure SSID, and a separate vlan for the guest wifi at each site.
 Going into the meraki deployment with no on site controllers...what is the simplest deployment for performance, security, and management?
 I assume we wouldnt want to do the "Meraki AP assigned" mode, where all clients get a 10.0.0.0/8 address.
 And do you make your wifi network one network? Assume theres no point in making each site its own network.

 Compared to an scenario where the switch supports OSPF, are there any major differences that one should account for?

 Apologies if this is not the right place for this question. I’ve been tasked with finding a way for our floor users to login to shared accounts on the computer with either fingerprint scanners or badge scanners. 
 So in a nutshell, we have many floor PCs in different areas and want to create shared accounts for those areas that only the users designated in that area can login to. We want to use a badge reader or fingerprint scanner to tie the user to a specific shared account which will then login to that shared account when scanned. 
 Does anyone have any input on this, whether it’s possible or not?

 The company I work for finally decided we should step away from Outlook for request handling and we get a say (not the final one) in which ticketsystem we will be using. And to use a translated version of a Dutch saying: I can't see the forest through all the trees. (There are too much of them to lose overview).
 The one we choose mustn't break the bank to much, but other than that we are allowed to suggest any ticketing system we feel would suit our needs. However, from what I can tell, most of them offer the same services with the same quality and for comparable prices. So my question to you all is: Which ticketing system do you use and why should or shouldn't we go for that one? One requirement though, it must use/support AzureAD SSO.
 I'd love to go for a big one like Service-Now or Jira, but I think those options will be shot down due to pricing. For reference, we are ±200 employee commercial company with 5 people in IT (not all 5 do support, but they will get an operator account).
 Can't wait to read what you all are using.

 I recently started a new job and have been tasked with providing my office with a scan to OneDrive solution. Here’s my issue, my coworker implemented brother’s with web scan in a different office but the issue is that after 10-15 users, each user needs to kick the other off to use it. I don’t think that’s scalable unless you plan on buying multiple MFPs for departments. In the past I was using PinPoint Scan with Kyoceras which I really liked.
 The way I see it is I either implement the solution already in place, or make the call to be different with hopefully the other offices following suit.
 Now, I’m no printer guru so I would love to hear what you all use for printing/scanning to the cloud (OneDrive preferred). I’ve spent a few days doing research on just Brother but I’m not finding much besides the web scan feature.
 Thank you!!

Each of those sites has their own VLANs that site on their core switches, and then there is a static default route (0.0.0.0/0) pointing to the firewall. On each firewall there is a VPN to the central site for accessing services etc. The drawback to this implementation is that there is no 'inter-site' routing at the minute and to access another site you need to go out from the central site. 
 With this in mind, I'm looking to implement OSPF but just not sure on how to design this, would all 5 sites sit in area 0, or would the main site be area 0 and the other 4 sites be their own respective areas? As I say, each site has their own core switches which the VLAN interfaces reside on so there are technically 2 x L3 devices (core switches and firewalls) at each site. I plan to use IPsec VPNs for the interconnectivity and utilise VTIs on the tunnel ends. I've tried to read up on this and view example topologies and although I understand the fundamentals of OSPF, I seem to be missing the very basics of a real world deployment!
 Any guidance on this would be greatly appreciated.
 Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I'm trying to achieve a SSO experience for my users and I can't make heads nor tails of the setup and where to look for additional information.
  
All devices are AADJ
 RDS servers is cloud based and runs it's own AD environment
 AD and AAD are synced- Username and passwords are synced ([username@companyname.root](mailto:username@companyname.root) for M365 and login into the RDS server)
 We currently have Cisco Duo Deployed for all users as an MFA solution on the RDS server and it's also de MFA provider for M365.
  
​
 The IT director want's to be able to click on a remote desktop icon and be immediately logged into the RDS server, because he feels that there is currently enough security in place that it's making it hard for users to login to the server. (yep, he said it)
 ​
 I've checked and found the following guide:https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-integrate-with-remote-desktop-services
 Which asked the pre-install de Azure proxy, which can be found here:
 https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/app-proxy/application-proxy-add-on-premises-application
 I've gone through both these guides, but when I then go to the RDWeb page, we still get the login prompt for that user.When trying to login to the server using an .RDP file.
 So maybe I've done something wrong, has anyone deployed this before and had succes?
 So I'm currently a bit lost in the SSO Sauce.
 In short:We have a hybrid environment with an RDS server and alle devices AADJ and we would like to achieve SSO to the RDS using MSTSC from the AADJ devices.
 Can someone point me in te right direction?
 ​
  
edit: added some clarification
 Edit again: formatting (I'm an idiot)

 The host currently uses 1.5Tb of data over 3 VMs but that will increase in the near future to approximately 3Tb over 7 VMs. The backup server will be connected over 10G SFP+ to a Meraki Switch and from there to the Hyper-V host.
 1.) How much disk space does the backup server need?
 2.) Should I use SSDs or HDDs?
 3.) I’m thinking of buying a Synology NAS for this and I’m eyeing the RS1221RP+ 8-bay NAS. Is this a good buy or should I consider something else?
 4.) Is RAID 5 with 4 drives (with space for potential expansion) enough?

I'm trying to sync a perforce project with a team in NZ and I'm based in the UK and no matter what connection I try I'm getting a hard sync limit of 2mbps up and down. I've tried two different PC's and two completely seperate internet connections with different providers.
 The port 1666 is forwarded. All firewall rules are set to allow P4V to access. I'm not recieving any network or connection errors, it's just insanely slow. Our sys admin gave me an IP for the US server and this has the same issue, hard limit of 2mbps. I've tried VPNs.
 My p4 info readout is instantaneous implying theres no issue with connecting to the server. Someone has tried using my account in NZ and it was fine so not an account issue.
 Unfortunately Perforce support still haven't replied after a week and our network admin based in NZ isn't too familiar with it but can't see what the issue could be on his side of things. So reaching out to alternative means. Will happily ping someone a tip if they help me fix this as it's really pushing my progress back on the project.
 Cheers!
 Edit: Running Windows 11. Workplace Ethernet connection and two different mobile hotspots have been tried. All yeild a hard sync cap of 2mbps. Zero issues with pulling file lists or connecting to the project in perforce. It's purely file transfer that is experiencing the latency. No Kaspersky

 My question is, on the MSL4048 I'm looking at getting it has an odometer showing 8304. I've tried to find online what this means but no luck - any ideas? Is it the hours that the robot has been in use, or the hours the library has been doing backups (e.g. reading/writing to tape). It does have a power on counter, so it won't be related to that.
 Also has anyone got experience with these libraries - anything to look out for? Well be using it with 2x LTO6 SAS drives. The library is replacing a si gle drive DELL TL1000 which has an LTO6 drive (hence why I'm going with the LTO6 in the MSL4048 so we can continue using all the tapes.

 ​
 Weird issue here. The monthly Windows CUs frequently trigger Bitlocker to demand a recovery key on boot. Obviously it thinks something has changed, but nothing has changed other than installing the updates. It only happens on our Dell Precision machines, and it doesn't happen to every one of them, or every time.
 Anyone experienced anything like this?

 We plan to order metal aluminum tags from MyAssetTag or Marverick, but how do we start? 
 Since we want use barcodes/QR codes, do we have to create a database first before ordering the labels? Or do we order the labels and just have whatever software we have to cater to the sequences they end up having? 
 Also what software would be a good fit for us? It'll just be physical electronics for now.

Being a solo show myself I know the difficulties, and I’ll admit it’s been especially challenging for me lately. I have no mentor, no higher up guiding me, no community of IT guys to jive with. Anyone with me on this or am I truly the only sole sysadmin left?

I came home and started thinking of when every Friday we had a catering order of bagels and spread delivered. I missed that and thought, “Hell, everyone’s having a hard time and fighting against each other. Let’s remember bagel day!”
 So I placed a catering order on my own dime. Bagels aren’t that expensive lol. I had it placed to be delivered before I start but when a majority of the people are there.
 I came in and people were super suspicious about the bagels and created their own private detective agency to find the man that ordered these bagels.
 Shows how good the people I work with are since my name was on the boxes lol. Once they figured out we had a good laugh. 
 The only thing that bothered me was, they kept asking “Why?” Why ask? I was just trying to be nice lol. 
 I’m just trying to look out for my users…

 What do you think will sail me long. I have been in Networking for almost 20 years and had several CCNAs and CCNP(Routing and Switching, Security, DevNet and Wireless). I am gearing up resources for CCDE or SRE or CISSP, as there are few job openings for Sr. Network Engineer in my area (The Bay Area)
 Through work, I have PluralSight and CBT Nuggets, and I personally got Cloud Academy's subscription. I couldn't decide what to start on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some background: The company I work for is fairly small, around 700 people. My job title is technically IT Support Specialist | Mac Admin (I do more sysadmin stuff than I do help desk or T1) Most of the environment is Azure, though we are a Hybrid deployment for reasons that don’t make sense to me. We have 25 ish Macs in the environment mostly Apple Silicon. Our current MDM is Intune and it sucks. We just went through the process of evaluating some MDM solutions for Mac and decided on Jamf. 
 Now, I’m not the most savvy person when it comes to Macs, but I have the most knowledge on the team. Which only makes sense that my boss asked me to do the full integration of Jamf and Apple Business Manager. I’ve started the process, but since we’re hybrid, I’m concerned about certificate pushing and a few other things that are mainly handled by our On-Prem Certificate issuing server. For those who have experience with this, how hard is it to integrate Jamf with a Hybrid environment be Azure only? I want to get this right the first time around.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm hoping to be pointed in the right direction for good documentation or design for redundant data center active-active internet edge that meets the following criteria:
  
Large dark fiber WAN with dozens of interconnected branch offices, no direct-to-internet
 All traffic to internet flows through the two (or more) data centers
 Data centers are geographically separated by 20 miles, but are connected by redundant dark fiber
 Active-active design is desired where outbound traffic can be load balanced, but also fail over to support one another
  
Currently the second data center is mostly failover only, with redundant equipment setup as standby or not existing at all in some cases. Capability for stretched layer2 is there via VXLAN/Cisco ACI. The second DC does have its own separate ISP circuits that are using the dark fiber to stretch layer-2 to the first DC in order to utilize it on the internet load balancer.

 I am going into a meeting shortly with a Security firm and they are pushing quite a lot of new tech onto our relatively small company. I am all for further tightening our security but I just want to know from some long term experts if they are pushing enterprise grade solutions onto a small family company. 
  
Less than 100 users
 On-prem AD + Azure AD
 Web based apps utilized, not self hosted
 Sophos EDR + firewall currently used
 By next financial we will retire all servers and push everything cloud based
  
They are pushing:
  
SIEM solution (not against this, but who's going to monitor?) (AT&T’s USM)
 MVS - Managed Vulnerability Scanning (Is this covered with an MDR or not?) (They will provide this)
 Netskope SASE (is this overkill?)
 MDR (SentinelOne) (I would prefer to stick with Sophos solution MDR)
  
Would love some advice here

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm trying to understand the behavior of how the baystack/nortel/avaya/extreme system works for vlanning in the following config:
 vlan configcontrol flexible
 vlan port 1 tagging unTagAll
 vlan members 2,3,4,5 1
 vlan ports 1 pvid 2
 This would make port 1 an access port, with vlans 2,3,4,5 on it, and a PVID of 2. But an access port shouldn't really have multiple vlans on it. I've seen configs where this is used as an alternative to untagPVID for VoIP or an inverse of the pvid with tagPVIDOnly.
 It seems like the device on the port would be able to communicate on its PVID vlan, but only be able to receive broadcast from the other vlans. untagall should strip all the 802.1q tags, so i'm not sure what vlan it's supposed to be communicating on. My best assumption is the PVID.
 Does anyone have experience with this?

 Has anyone switched from Palo Alto to Fortinet? We're in the EDU sector so pricing is a significant factor. I love the Palo and have had no issues for 6 years. But, we're coming up to our next refresh. For those who have migrated how did that go? Were there hiccups or roadblocks you ran into? How is support vs. Palo? How is just general day-to-day management? Anything else that I should be thinking of or insight you can provide would be appreciated!

 One of the published restrictions is you can't change the burned in serial number...but I also know some engineers at Cisco who say they use it in their labs with different serials, so there's got to be some way to modify it very unofficially.
 Has anyone here done that, or know how I would potentially go about it?

 For the last couple months when a device is offline it doesn't return request timed out but instead gives me a reply from an IP that is way different than the scheme we are using. Its not a massive issue as I can quickly recognize an incorrect IP for our network. But it has me very curious as to why this is happening and if its fixable? Nobody in my dept seems to have any idea what I'm talking about. I'm hoping maybe someone here could provide insight. 
 edit: after looking at rule 4 I wanted to also mention that I have tried clearing dns and that his happens whether I'm on site or VPN.

 Office is located in India. When a users laptop is connected to the wired LAN, no issues. When the same laptop is connected to the wireless network the Network Connection indicator shows no internet, but users can connect and browse, although its slow and Outlook drops connection intermittently. Wireless and Wired are on different subnets. 
 Doing an nslookup on the wired network to msftconnecttest.com gets a reply address based in India. Same nslookup on the wireless network gets a reply address based in Singapore. 
 If we update the host file on the laptop with the local address for msftconnecttest.com, the wireless network shows connected with no browsing issues, so this has to be DNS related, right??
 Again, any thoughts, direction, have you seen this before, even commiserating on this would be so appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some of my co workers are convinced that newer model media converters we are using are storing mac addresses like a switch would. Reason for this assumption is we have noticed that if we unplug the device on the media converter and then plug in a second device, the second device will not authenticate, because the switch is still seeing the first mac. The fix for this seems to be power cycling the media converter. Shutting and no shutting the switch interface does not seem to fix it, only power cycling the media converter.
 We actually had a device that was connected and failing mab authentication, but even when the device was removed, we still saw logs populating on the switch saying the device was failing. Personally, I was thinking this could be something with DHCP snooping still holding the mac in the database, or maybe some kind of AAA thing. But I really dont see how a media converter could be holding a mac, unless im wrong. 
 Does this make any sense at all? I was always under the assumption that all media converters are layer 1 devices, and they in no way store any information at all.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're a smaller company (200 endpoints, 20 servers), and are looking to move to InTune/365 for workstation management (and MDM). Seems to make total sense, and we don't have complex management requirements, and we're already licensed for it.
 Our current environment is pretty simple and 'traditional' - machines joined to a domain, a couple simple GPOs, and some third party patching and inventory apps. All Win10, but looking to move to Win11 later this year and next:
 I have a bunch of questions that I'm having a bit of a hard time nailing down and getting conflicting answers:
  
If we enroll a PC, it looks like it still stays on the domain... At that point I guess we just... disable GPOs (and move them into InTune)? I presume InTune should become the single source of truth for management/policies? 
 User Profiles - If we enroll a device and they're still joined to the domain - I presume they keep the existing user profile?
 A user gets a new PC (Win10 or 11) - Should it even be joined to the domain at that point? Is there any value add anymore?
 Virtually all of our apps are web apps - except for a traditional file share (Z: drive) - I know a non-domain machine can still connect to a file share (they would need to manually put in their creds)... Anything to be aware of here? (We want to get rid of this file share, most of our stuff is in sharepoint, but we still have a legacy LOB app requiring it for now - looking to get away from that next year).
 Servers - Can stay on the domain (and probably need to), but what are you all doing for management of servers (eg. patching)? I know Azure has autopatch and a few things, but that seems very... limited in behavior.
  
Anything else we should be aware of? Seems simple from a certain standpoint, but also completely different than what we've been used to doing for 25 years.

 I need to extend a VLAN from my data centre to a remote site while keeping the same subnet over VPN. I have a Cisco 5545 ASA at the DC and a FirePower 1010 at the remote office. 
 From some reading, this does not sound possible over an ASA. I have seen others using some routers with L2TPv3 to make this work, even from behind an ASA in some cases. 
 Anyone have any suggestions or ideas or any reading material I can review? Thanks.

 I found something simular for developers (its in german: https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/techwiese/default.aspx), but not for sysadmins.
 I found the newsletters (https://www.microsoft.com/de-de/techwiese/newsletter/default.aspx), which are for IT Pros. Thats a start, but I think there have to be a news site for sysadmins from microsoft, or not?
 The goal is to be up to date as a windows sysadmin. The most other news sites are full with unnecessary news, like gaming and other stuff, just to produce content (with no sense).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Afternoon all,
 When I started in my current role there were next to no protections in place on basically anything to do with IT. I'm going to list the major things I have implemented, could you wonderful people let me know if there's anything missing?
  
Conditional access policy to only allow access from the UK (all our staff are remote working, but UK only)
 Sophos AV on every machine
 Sophos spam filter on every inbox 
 Rebuilt SharePoint environment to manage permissions 
 Only allow use of Microsoft Edge
 Whitelist of which Edge extensions are permitted 
 Web filter to block malicious sites
 Block USB storage devices 
 SSO on everything where possible (and within budget) else 2FA implemented 
 Sophos Firewall in all office sites 
  
I think that about sums it up. 
 What industry standard protections am I missing?
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello fellow sysadmins! I’m reaching out to see if anyone has implemented the cloud Kerberos trust model for hybrid azure ad joined devices? I’m managing from Intune and got workstation logins working. I also completed early testing of Remote Credential Guard to get RDP access working. But I’m stuck at on-prem auth prompting with Windows Integrated Security. It prompts for PIN, I enter, and it prompts again. One example in my enviromemt is with Windows Admin Center Gateway. I’m think something is amiss, but I can’t put my finger on it. It’s worth mentioning I have 1 Windows Server 2022 DC promoted and the rest are 2012 (to be replaced). 
 Any insight would be appreciated! 
 Thanks, JB

 Which app is best for it, or maybe it would be better to write a bash script for it?
 I want a simple solution configuration, like Grafana plus Prometheus, which is too complicated for me at the moment.

 I want to set up the router for use with digital mixing consoles (sound engineering) such as Yamaha QL etc. and control via the iPad app. 
 I've watched a few videos on the ER-X setup, but most are for creating a home wifi network that is connected to the internet. 
 I am currently connecting to my MBP over Ethernet to port Eth1, I have access to the router on 192.168.1.1 
 I'm not understanding how to setup a WLAN and the U6 as an AP and have the router act as a DHCP server when I plug it in to the console so it is discoverable by the iPad.
 Any help is greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are going to force a group of users to re-register their MFA and push them to use MS Authenticator. Right now my strategy is to do so as below:
 1.) In Azure AD user account, select require re-register multifactor authentication and revoke multifactor authentication sessions. 
 2.) In O365 Admin Portal, sign out of all sessions. (We find we need to do this as the requirement to login and see the MFA registration is taking to long and need the change to be immediate. 
 ​
 Does this make sense? I'm contemplating not doing the revoke multifactor authentication steps as it may be redundant, but I think it makes sense to cover all bases as we want them to re-register MFA completely and authenticate again.

 Ah, the common question that we all get asked the second we have a small moment of downtime. Oh, finally have a moment to catch up on previous projects? Or have a few hours to train a new employee? Or simply having time to catch a breather after putting out fires all week? Fuck you, doesn’t matter because you’re not a boastful, loud-about-his-work schmuck and simply prefer to fix computer issues and keep it pushing to the next. 
 This is exactly my (and a lot of other admins’) gripe when it comes to more customer facing roles. In previous years, my position has been held by 3 people, then 2, then finally just me being the solo admin when i got onboarded. I guess now they’re wondering “hmm why even have an sysadmin at this point?”
 I got my experience that I wanted with this company and it’s about that time I start looking for another job anyways. When I go, they will finally get what they want and have no admin in office. Maybe they’ll see exactly what we “do” then lol.
 Hopefully I can break into a cyber/less customer facing role for this next one.

In that list of accounts, it is showing a domain admin account that has never been used to log into that computer with. I also checked, it's not a local account either. They selected "Restart" and it went into a disk repair and booted fine. They restarted again and the blue screen came back up.
 Since I can't get into the office today, I had them unplug the computer and disconnect it from the network because I'm paranoid.
 But, I'm not quite understanding how it can reference a domain admin account that 1. has never been used to log into that computer with and 2. while the computer is not connected to the network.
 Thoughts?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, I am currently doing some self study on a pair on Cisco 2911 routers and trying to get more familiar with establishing a secure VPN between them. As this is mostly covering open standards I am hoping that this is the more appropriate place to ask these questions.
 I am struggling to find answers from Google and have reached out to another network engineer who isn't sure either.
 Once I have configured a secure ISAKMP connection between devices, I am aware that the device then negotiates an appropriate IPsec policy to follow. However going through the system help and exploring available commands, I have noticed that you can define an IPsec transform set without specifying most of the IPsec framework.
 As an example, I have made an IPsec transform set with the following command.
  
crypto ipsec transform-set TEST-TUNNEL esp-3des
  
The only things that have been defined from the IPsec framework from this command is the protocol type (esp) and the confidentiality (3des). I have not defined integrity, authenticity or the diffie-hellman group. Yet the iOS has accepted my command regardless and has created the transform set.
 How does the system make up for half the framework being unconfigured? Does it take it from the existing ISAKMP policy? A system default policy? Just create a tunnel without any of those policies applied or would it be unsuccessful?
 In addition i've seen the command comp-lzs as an option, though iOS does not allow me to create a map exclusively with this alone. From Googling I have seen that it has something to do with compression and should not be used alongside voice or video, though are there any good resources that can explain the lzs algorithm and its application in laymans terms?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Nowadays most of the software tends to have web-interface (which I admit is much better than having crappy client software) but this makes it a burden to keep track of and update certs needed to access these web interfaces.
 Examples of such software - various controllers (unifi, aruba), printers and/or printing software (for example I have YSoft SafeQ). Some of them are on various distributions of linux, some of them are on windows by are ported from linux (i.e. they do not utilize windows certificate manager and it's autorenewal capabilities but rather use a traditional linux way - say tomcat config file that references cert file and key in a folder).
 Over years this becomes especially more important task to solve with the tendency to reduce maximum certificate validity period.
 What are you guys doing there?
  
Do you write custom scripts for each specific service?
 
Do you update these certs manually (once every X month/years or when your monitoring tells you to)
 
Do you completely ignore the need to use certificates and instead use no cert or provided by service self-signed certs?
 
 And if you do automate the renewal (especially interested for the case with onprem Windows CA to linux webservers) - then how are you doing it?

 Looking for a good remote access solutions to PC all within the same LAN. Here's the catch though... none of them can get out to the internet. We have servers that can get out, and the hope is that we can deploy a remote access solution that we would be able to access the machines across the network jumping through the server. Essentially we'd use a solution like TeamViewer to instigate a session to the server, and would want to jump to the deployed machines from there. 
 We have been using Windows remote desktop connection in the interim, however, this isn't a good solution for this use case as the machine gets logged out when disconnecting from the session, making things more difficult on the user. 
 Anyone have any experience in deploying a remote access solution that works just across the LAN? Like I said, opening up the network to allow these machines out to the internet is NOT something we can do in this instance. 
 Thanks sysadmins!

 I called them up yesterday to get a new SSID added to all of our manufacturing sites. This is a real simple thing that didn't require any complex routing or anything, it's basically a secondary guest Wi-Fi, right? No big deal.
 Some fuckknuckle logged into the centralized manager for all the firewalls and apparently clicked push to two of our primary manufacturing sites without paying any attention to what he was doing. This pushed two old configuration files to those sites which overwrote half of the SSIDs that were already in place and vital to our 24/7 manufacturing. You'd think this was easily fixable by rolling back to the previous nights stored config, right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 We have a customer running a product called Autodesk Vault on an AWS instance (Windows Server 2019). Recently they have been experiencing really poor performance on the software and we've been trying to get to the bottom of it. 
 The software is file storage / BLOB vault with clients connecting to it via a IIS web application layer. The customer has about 3 users on the system so it's not a huge deployment and the vault database is about 150gb (140gb of BLOB and 10gb of database spread across ~ 15 MDF) 
  
The instance is idling most of the time on CPU ( <10% usage)
 It's using less than 40% available memory. I've checked SQL server and it's using about 1/4 of the available 1.4gb shared memory pool
 Network speed tests are very good (as you would expect from AWS)
 Disk activity doesn't appear very high but...
  
Having checked everything with the developers, the problems seemed to be stemming from the database. We've upgraded the storage from "gp2" tier to gp3 and doubled the IOPS and throughput from 900 IOPS / ~250MB/s to 5000 IOPS / 500MB/s.
 Having done all this its running a bit better but not dramatically better. It's not clear though if it is the storage which is the bottleneck or if something else is going on.
 The server currently runs MS SQL Express 2019 but we're nowhere near hitting the memory pool limit and it doesn't appear like its getting thrashed. I just wondered though if there are any other limits/issues which could be causing this version of SQL Server to be causing problems? 
 Does anyone know if upgrading to MS SQL Server Standard 2019 offers any performance benefits over Express for general SQL work loads?

 I've got two Windows VMs at two different sites on separate internet connections that need to communicate securely for a PowerBI solution we have. Both VMs are also accessible by their respective networks.
 My understanding is I can set up an OpenVPN server at site A and install the client on the VM at site B. Providing we configure the firewall correctly, that should do it?
 Is this a suitable solution or should I be looking for something else to accomplish it?

 I have a batch pool that gets created from a python function inside function app - and I need some advice, as I am newbie and I feel like I cant find this information, or I don't know where to look.
 My batch account is inside a vnet, and initially my batch pool was created with no network configuration. The nodes ended up in an unusable state everytime because "the batch agent extension provisioning has failed on compute node". I also didnt see the vms being allocated inside any of my subnets, so then I explicitly created it in one of my snets. I did see them allocated in that subnet, but the 'unusable' result was the same. I have no private endpoint for the vms, and the policy of my organization does not allow opening the RDP port publicly, so I cant use RDP to test anything in the vnet. But before configuring the batch to be created in the subnet, I connected to the vm and it seemed like nslookup did find the DNS of the storage account for the batch. However, the resource files are not being downloaded to the VMs from the storage account. The NSGs are already configured and the ports should be fine. Can anyone please give a helping hand?

 I'm currently facing a dilemma and could use some guidance from our sysadmin and fellow Redditors. 
 Our organization business is healthcare. We have a diverse workforce comprising employees, contractors, and a third-party outsourced team of developers who need access to our resources hosted at on-prem data centers. Compromised of mix devices BYOD and Corporate managed. Typically, contractors and 3rd Party outsourcing companies will use their own company-provided devices. However, I'm having trouble deciding on the best solution for secure remote access.
 Legacy VPN and direct IT resources are a definite "hell no" for me, as they seem outdated and potentially risky. I've been researching alternatives solution, namely, Cloud hosted VDIs and ZTNA, but I'm still confused about which option would be the right fit for our organization. when it is appropriate to use each of these solutions.
 I would greatly appreciate your insights.

 I hope this post finds you all in good spirits. Today, I come before you as a recent graduate from the esteemed Clark University, where I completed my Master of Science in Business Analytics in May 2023. As an international student who set foot on American soil with boundless ambitions, I possess a deep-rooted passion for problem-solving and critical thinking.
 ​
 However, I find myself facing a daunting challenge as I aspire to carve out a career path in Cloud Engineering. Regrettably, my background lacks the necessary experience and exposure in this particular field. The current market landscape exacerbates my anxiety day by day, as I encounter the disheartening reality of not receiving even a call for the positions I seek as a Business Analyst.

 We have a long building that we essentially consider three buildings in one (A, B, and C) since they are all connected. At the far end of the building is our network closet and throughout the buildings UAPs were installed (2 per building). The two in bldg C went out and I have to trace the cables but I can't figure out where they go and all of the connections on the 8-port switch show the link lights are active (I don't have any network tools yet). I also ran nslookup on the network and it was able to find the IP addresses and names of all the UAPs, so I was at least able to obtain that information for the two UAPs that are down.
 Whoever installed the network left no documentation and the person I replaced passed away. I don't have the login for the Unifi gateway, the router, no cables are labeled, nothing is organized. Anyway, I think the UAPs might run to another switch before going to the switch in the network closet but no one knows where that is located or if that's even how it was done. My other thought is that I think the UAP cables might be punched down on the patch panel.
 Is it normal or common practice to run cables between 200 to 500 ft directly from the UAPs and punch them down on the patch panel as opposed to using network drops? I've never seen a setup like this before.

 I’ve put out the vast majority of the fires that needed immediate addressing and conducted a thorough audit of our hardware, and most of it is at least six years old. A couple of weeks ago I retired a server that had software that was installed in 2012.
 Based on quick and dirty math, we have 33x machines in particular that cost us about $104 an hour of downtime and the machines themselves ship with a LTSC version of Windows 7… 
 This leads to my question. How do I pitch a costly hardware upgrade to the company in such a way that it’s obviously the correct business decision? Potential damage the brand, lost revenue from downtime and bringing us up to code with regards to TPM are already on the list, any suggestions?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It's been a long time since I was a network guy and while I'm 99% I'm sure of the answer here in the interest of security I wanted to run it by some network experts to ensure this is 100% right. The gear is Unifi USW switches and a non-Unifi third party firewall.
 I have a microserver with single physical ethernet port. The parent interface is defined in the 192.168.200.0/24 network. It has a subinterface in the 192.168.220.0/24 network, and that is tagged on VLAN 220. My firewall has VLANs defined to restrict traffic, so I need the parent interface to be assigned to VLAN 200, but I can't do that in the GUI on this server and I am trying not to make changes I may forget about via CLI.
 To manage this, the Unifi switch port has a native network on VLAN 200 assigned, and it is tagged for VLAN 220. That should leave the subinterface traffic unaltered and on VLAN 220, but will add VLAN 200 to the traffic on the parent interface only, correct?
 Put most simply, the switch will pass the physical/parent traffic to the firewall with VLAN 200, but it won't modify the VLAN 220 tagged traffic from the subinterface because that traffic is already tagged. Correct?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work for a FTTH ISP and we are currently using a Cisco Nexus as our Edge. We are just taking default routes from our upstreams and we have two upstream providers (one 100G and one 40G). Traffic flows out one and back in over both. It works but we are looking to take full BGP tables from both and possible a third.
 We don't really use any advanced router features, just the typical BGP, OSPF, a few static routes, and route maps. We are struggling to find a solution that offers the port speeds we use, can handle the BGP tables, and is cost effective.
 We are primarily a Cisco shop, mostly using secondhand gear. I realize our needs may push us to purchasing something new and that's fine if it is the case.
 I stumbled across the Cisco NCS line and it looks like it might be up our alley. I was mostly interested in something like the 5504 or 5508 so we could grow it as we grow. The licensing has me tripped up a little bit though. I see them secondhand but I'm not so sure I can just buy one and it would work. I guess my main question is do these things require ongoing licensing and if so can I buy one used and purchase a license for it? Or do I need to go through a reseller and purchase one new.
 I'm also open to alternative solutions. Our current Edge router is using 2 100G ports and 4 40G ports. We have quite a few 10G ports on it as well. I've been looking at Juniper's stuff and also considered looking at a whitebox solution such as Edge-Core. If we go with something else I prefer something as close to Cisco CLI as possible. Money is always an issue... we have it but I have to beg to get it. The worst part is going through all of the sales calls with each vendor just to get pricing information so I was hoping to get some solid ideas before I go through all of that.

 already posted in r/fortinet
 we are a msp who offer an all inclusive cloud platform. within this we also deploy and support the on prem stuff from notebooks, switches, access points to firewalls. the endcustomer never touches the networking device (for this post important - the firewall) nor does config changes to it. at the moment we are transfereing from sophos utm to fortinet firewalls. as background info, with sophos we had 0 automation. every firewall was setup completely by hand (a lot of pain and very time consuming). we decided to manage our new fortis with fortianalyzer and fortimanager. all config changes are made on the manager and are pushed from there on to the device.
 we are expecting to migrato over 400 firewalls in the next years, as the sophos utm is going eol in 2026.
 now i wondered how other msps or multi tenant orgs deploy, patch and manage their forti firewalls. we looked into the fortimanager built in template features, but find them to be very limiting. we want to work with meta variables for all customer specific things and built all the other stuff as a standard. about 70% of our firewalls in the field do more or less the same config (some have a few special cases, more or fewer networks etc).
 is the best way to go cli scripts over fortimanager with variables or build an IaC etc…?
 i hope, that i have stated our situation well enough and hope to hear some interesting suggestions.

It was setup previously but was not troubleshot when it stopped. When I log onto the WSUS server and open the Windows Server Update Services I get "Database error an error occurred when trying to perform a database operation" the only option is copy error or reset server node. Not knowing much about WSUS where do I even start?
 I've found a few related event logs,
 12022 - The Client Web Service is not working
 10022 - The last catalog synchronization attempt was unsuccessful.
 13032 - Many client computers have not reported back to the server in the 
 last 30 days. 39 have been detected so far.
 I've tried restarting services related to WSUS, and I have also followed a few quick fixes that involved restarting the wsus application pool in IIS. 
 Before I get way too deep down this rabbit hole, is there a better solution being used to maintain updates? Preferably free or included software? I am trying to keep this a low cost or free patch management solution.
 Please let me know what other details I can provide. Any help in the right direction would be most appreciated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work from home. Lately I’ve become really frustrated with how much I’ve been slacking off and procrastinating during work hours.
 I’ve noticed that, whenever I have to solve an issue, especially those that take hours or days to solve, I can work nonstop. I'll skip my afternoon snacks, I’ll voluntarily work overtime without pay, etc. The issue occupies my mind 24/7 and I only stop once I’m able to solve it.
 Other times, though, I need to work on planning, documentation and ‘research’ tasks. I know those tasks are important but I keep procrastinating on them. I take much longer to finish than I should. Instead of working on them, I’ll just read books or stare at the screen or browse the Internet. I don’t really know why but I find those kinds of tasks really daunting.
 I did engage in busy work at my former company (in person) but much less often and only when I really had nothing to do. Going to the office is not an option for me because my company is from a different country. I’m considering going to a coworking space but it’s extra money I’d have to pay, plus I would lose a lot of conveniences from WFH.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I currently work for a company that uses Orion for our network monitoring platform. As a directive from about, we're now looking at another SaaS type network monitoring solution. The solution seems to be far from mainstream (not going to mention by name, but HPE just bought them). There seems to be little information about anybody experience using it, but someone one of our VPs used to work with use it, and so it comes recommended and seems to be what we're going to be using soon. 
 We are a very heavy Grafana shop. The vast majority of our application stack and business process flow monitored with Grafana. It's seemingly the Go To solution for most of our monitoring....except for infrastructure (network/servers). 
 The primary driver to the proposed migration is cost. New vendor says they can save us tons, and we can eliminate Orion and PagerDuty. I'm questioning since we are so heavily using Grafana why we aren't at least considering it for infrastructure, I suggested we at least explore a small POC to see how it would work for what we need. 
 Is there anyone out there using Grafana for their infrastructure monitoring? Horror or success stories? I'm starting to do a bit of research to see if this is a good use case, I see some articles on the topic, but not much from the aspect of 'it's what we use, here's how it works for us'.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Looks like there's a new Windows/Office CVE in the wild that is already being exploited.
 https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/blog/2023/07/11/storm-0978-attacks-reveal-financial-and-espionage-motives/
 https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2023-36884
 There's currently no patch available, but a few mitigations:
  
Customers who use Microsoft Defender for Office are protected from attachments that attempt to exploit this vulnerability.
 
In current attack chains, the use of the Block all Office applications from creating child processes Attack Surface Reduction Rule will prevent the vulnerability from being exploited.
 
Organizations who cannot take advantage of these protections can set the FEATURE_BLOCK_CROSS_PROTOCOL_FILE_NAVIGATION registry key to avoid exploitation. Please note that while these registry settings would mitigate exploitation of this issue, it could affect regular functionality for certain use cases related to these applications. Add the following application names to this registry key as values of type REG_DWORD with data 1.:
 
  
Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\FeatureControl\FEATURE_BLOCK_CROSS_PROTOCOL_FILE_NAVIGATION
  
 Excel.exe
 Graph.exe
 MSAccess.exe
 MSPub.exe
 PowerPoint.exe
 Visio.exe
 WinProj.exe
 WinWord.exe
 Wordpad.exe
  
The question is what "certain use cases" the registry entries above could actually affect. Anyone got any insights on this?

 Edit For more information: Our current setup is 2 Cisco asa 5525X running in high availability They are two different ISPs They are setup to forward all traffic to the gateway if it doesnt match and a Nat rule

 About a year ago I became a manager over the entire Infrastructure team. I asked one of my Network Admins to take me around to all the network closets and ran into this room where we have been experiencing years of mildew problems. I had no clue about this and am shocked that this was the first I was learning about it.
 I spoke to Facilities and they replaced the AC unit last year to try and fix this issue. I have learned that in the past we have experienced outages that were linked back to damage in the patch panel so they had to replace the ports. 
 I would like to clean up this mildew but how? Do I scrubbing with a brush or is it just better to just replace the patch panels? I was thinking this was just a contact issue with the cable but could the cabled be damaged in anyway?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello!
 We're making a transition from a Cisco to an Aruba switch in our core. Just learned that NetFlow is proprietary to Cisco. The Aruba switch supports sFlow but we don't want to just sample packets, we want to log every connection--source and destination, ports, time and number of packets / amount of data transferred. We don't need to keep and store all the data that was transferred, just the connection/header info mentioned above.
 Does anyone know of a good (maybe open-source/free) platform that could provide similar analysis/logging as compared to NetFlow, but based only on gathering mirrored network traffic? We aren't looking for something inline, just need to be able to go back in time and see what traffic flows are associated with a particular IP/host. For reference, we are currently exporting NetFlow data to SolarWinds which provides a webGUI for analysis of the exported data. I was wondering if an IPS like Snort might be able to do this.
 Thanks and best regards!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I have a rather strange issue.
 We have an internet service managed by Luminet. It's a ISP managed HSRP via two of their CISCO routers. So two different circuits and they handle the IP failover.
 The two CISCOs are directly connected to each other.
 I have this connected into 2 x HP 2530 Switches on a dedicated VLAN for the WAN connection.
 So CISCO1 ETH0 goes to Switch 1 port 48 and CISCO2 ETH0 goes to Switch 2 port 48
 There is a fibre connection between the two HP switches just carrying the VLAN for the WAN connections. This is done via a HP LACP trunk and STP.
 Each of the HP Switches then has a connection to two internal fibre switches on an LACP Trunk carrying just the Management VLAN only. To allow access for managing the switches etc.
 We then have a port configured on each switch to uplink to our Watchguard HA Firewalls for WAN VLAN
 Basically the issue is when the two ISP WAN connections are connected to the required HP switch port 48 our end it creates a loop and kills the network. If I leave loop protect enabled it will block the port, then unblock, then block and cause issues.
 So essentially it's blocking the link to one of the ISP routers ports that's dedicated for the WAN uplink.
 I have tried putting the WAN ports on a HP Trunk as untagged and still it kills the network ports and then connectivity.
 ​
 I'm running out of ideas currently. Anyone seen this before?

 Azure files seems like it would work to fulfill the azure requirement, but wouldn't help cross-site to the other location.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The release of Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK V2 by Microsoft has introduced a new challenge for Microsoft 365 admins - the need to migrate existing scripts once again. Unlike before, the familiar "select-MgProfile" option for switching to the beta profile is no longer available with SDK V2. Instead, admins must install the beta module separately. Furthermore, the v1.0 and beta modules differ in their cmdlet prefixes.
 One reason administrators have heavily relied on the beta profile is its ability to retrieve all the necessary properties, unlike v1.0 which only retrieves limited properties when executing cmdlets. Consequently, previously migrated scripts from Azure AD now require yet another migration effort. The cycle seems never-ending as we navigate these continuous updates and adapt their scripts accordingly.
 Have you encountered the script migration challenge? Share your experience and insights.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 It maybe a stupid question, but I really want some advice on it
 ​
 Question: If I mirror traffic from a vlan, will all traffic cross different switchs with same vlan can be monitor?
 ​
 consider
  
there are multi switchs and have multi vlans
 truck port connect different switchs (not stacking)
 e.g. 192.168.65.1 send traffic to 192.168.66.1, if I mirror vlan66, can traffic be monitor?
 ​
  
- switch1 have 3 device connected and have different vlan (device1a,2a,3a) (vlan1 device a, vlan2 device a, vlan3 device c)
 - switch2 have 3 device connected and have different vlan (device1b,2b,3c)
 - switch3 have connect switch 1 and 2 with truck port (switch 3 contain the vlan gateway)
 if device 1a communicate with 2a, will mirror port contain related traffic on switch 2 or 3?

 What are people using? I regularly pay for software if I think the price is reasonable, $70 for my basic use just is simply too steep.

 We run Windows 10 21H2, our desktop team has attempted to push various GPO settings but with little to no affect.

I just recently moved over people from a hosting company to 365 for their email. Everything is working great minus trying to send a scan to someone's email through SMTP through their multifunction printer. I got the SMTP info and plugged it in and nothing happens. There's not even a error. Just to let you know they're using two third party apps. One is called office protect and the other is called proof point which I believe may be the issue but I'm not too sure. Just wanted to put it in there.
 Things that I have done and checked 1. I have made sure that the account that I'm using to send out of has a business basic license and that SMTP is turned on 2. I make sure that I'm using TLS not SSL that's according to Microsoft's official documentation 3. I made the proper connector to allow from partner organization to internal and using their static IP
 If anyone has any information that could help me or at least lead me in the right direction I would be much appreciated.

 If you ask me, "what color is the car" and I tell you, "it is blue", I think that is a fair answer. How would I know you'd expected me to say, "the car is blue, it has tinted windows, it is a GM car, it has custom plates and I think it is a 1992 model". If I were to give an answer like that without specific questions asked I could go on forever describing that car, ultimately giving information that may be unnecessary.
 Am I the only one confused with this feedback or I could be overlooking something. Does it make sense to you folks?

 My group will manage both the servers and the clienst sides, and i'm thinking about the tool stack we'll need, and i would like to begin studying and using Ansible, that's not really used in small companies here in Italy.
 Anyone has real hand-on experience on it? in particular i would like to know if:
 - The reporting features are good or on-par with other tools, e.g. N-able RMM
 - Can be created complex tasks like "initiate a snapshot of the vserver on vmware, only if it's ok then start patching it with preapproved patches"
 - It can reimage a remote pc
 ​
 I know the question can be confused, but i would like to have your insights and general tips and tricks, thank you :)

 Any suggestions?

 I currently use a self signed certificate since the network is isolated from the web, but almost all modern browsers trigger a warning when accessing the server. I found a solution that involves trusting the certificate but it is problematic since many different devices would access this server when connected to the network.
 Another solution was to create a private certificate authority but I want to minimize the changes I would need to do to the network. I haven't found anything else so I'm asking here in case I missed something.

 Automation is something I've wanted to do for a few weeks but wouldn't sit down long enough to understand it. 
 After reading through comments, and a resource someone mentioned, I went to work. I've already begun learning and applying today and the time saved is insane. I'm still in uni and working at a startup, so you can imagine that I am a bit thrilled. I'm looking forward to optimizing more of my time.

 Currently a firewall policy that routes requests to 2 servers.

 I have a quick question. We had a special solution made for an apartment building due to lack of ports, so we took 1 port (port 13) from our layer 3 switch, configured it with 11 vlans and then sent it to a layer 2 switch in the basement of that buildning and distributed the ports to each apartment, 11 in total. Worked fine but now that layer 2 switch died, and we have no good sized replacement for it unless we want to set up an entire layer 3 24 port switch which would be quite expensive. 
 The question is, can I configure 2 (6port) + WAN + Fibre CPEs. Where the first CPE takes Vlans 330,331,332,333,334 on the first 5 ports, then connect the second CPE to port 6, carry over the last 6 vlans, and put them on the 6 ports of the second CPE, in order to chain them, given correct configuration on the CPEs ofc. 
 Hopefully this was explained somewhat comprehensible.

 Prime company hired a new IT guy to support the test team.
 We are on separate teams, he supports one client I support the other.
 Before he was hired I spent months developing both environments. It wasn't complicated. Vm environment with windows 10 vms that have commerical and government software. About 10 vms, some physical, all windows 10.
 I was psyched for his hire, he boasted that he was a VMware sme. He didn't need an instruction on any of the hardware or software. He was a genius... That's fine I consider myself an idiot so of he is smarter than me great it's needed. 
 I tell them all I am taking my wife to lunch and taking the first true lunch since I started. I was working 12 hour shifts before he came. 
 I go to lunch and before our food arrives I get a phone call.
 Gov boss: GET BACK HERE ASAP WE HAVE AN ISSUE Me (calm and collected): okay what's up? Gov: WE NEED TO DROP A FILE ON A VMS DESKTOP Me (annoyed): dude, new guy said he is the smartest vm guy of them all, can't he do it? Gov: HE CANT, HE TRIED, I DONT THINK HE KNOWS ANYTHING!!!
 I am a sub to the prime so I got super nervous, I mean if I don't rush back we could all be in trouble. 
 They are attempting to plug the hardrive with the file into a monitor that is not even attached to the system and can't understand why it's not popping up. I angerly grabbed the hd plugged it into the server attached it to the vm and asked what file they needed.... It was a text file with 1 line of code... They could have fucking hand jammed it... No apologies... That dude was a waste of a hire and this day was just the building block.
 Gov IT tho amiright?

 Im going to read docs now so I understand better, but figured Id ask.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello all!
 I have been tasked with putting together a package for an AV company that puts on events. They want to do an ad-hoc network that will support up to 300 wireless clients at a time. The use case is simply to provide public wifi to check emails, browse, social media, etc. The AP/switching/routing portion is pretty easily accomplished. We plan on implementing client isolation, of course, and bandwidth limiting each client to about 2 Mbps. So total throughput really would only need to be 600Mbps if all devices were running full tilt.
 They want to use cellular to connect to WAN, and so my first thought was Cradlepoint. Specifically looking at this one https://cradlepoint.com/product/endpoints/w1850-series/ . The data sheet states that it can do 2 Gbps passthrough... so im assuming this is factoring in download AND upload. But for anyone that actually uses these things.... are you getting ANYWHERE near that speed? I understand that not all devices are created equal... but I have a 5g modem for traveling and it gets around 20Mbps... my cell phone gets around 2.
 This would be in the seattle metro area so coverage from all carriers is excellent in most places. What are your real life experiences with speeds on these things?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Until recently, I could reliably capture CDP packets using pktmon. Suddenly it stopped working for some unknown reason. Maybe the admins changed something. I've since turned to netsh, however I haven't gotten this one to work just yet.
 I'm running these commands from a computer that gets its network through a Cisco VoIP phone (7831).
 ​
 For pktmon:
 pktmon filter add -m 01-00-0C-CC-CC-CC
 pktmon start -c --comp <interfaceindex> --pkt-size 0 -f C:\capture.etl
 pktmon counters --live
 Again, this was working. I was able to use this, along with some parsing in powershell, to get the phone number, MAC address, and IP address of the phone. But as I said, it no longer does.
 ​
 For netsh:
 netsh trace start capture=yes Ethernet.DestinationAddress=01-00-0C-CC-CC-CC tracefile=C:\trace.etl maxsize=1 report=disabled
 From what I've gathered, it can take up to 2 minutes to see the packet, but I've run both for much longer with nothing to show. What am I missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey y'all. New to the networking world, dropped my previous career of logistics and recently got hired onto a network engineer position. Currently I travel about 9 months out of the year, with a new site each week/2 weeks. Nothing too extreme, mostly dealing with Fortinet transitions from Cisco hardware, not too many new installs, mostly small refreshes. I currently carry a Swiss Gear bag, and it holds my two laptops, the chargers, and my Nintendo Switch case (necessity, ofcourse). In my duffel I carry an Ekahau Sidekick 2, 2 tablets, and about 4 patch cables, a coupler with each (for both laptops), andd a plethora of adapters and different console/serial cables. I have a sense that I'm too cluttered or may not be carrying as efficiently, if anyone has any recommendations for the full time travel gig bag, or what works best for them, I'd love to hear.
 TLDR: Need backpack recs for new network engineer, feel as if carrying too much for these trips.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Something I learned recently, Cisco IOS routers and switches can act as an mDNS (Bonjour in Apple lingo) gateway. If you've ever had to shuffle mDNS traffic (discovery of printers, chromecast, airplay devices, ...) between VLANs, this is for you. The go to solution on the internet is installing Avahi on a linux VM somewhere and turn on "enable-reflector" to make it rebroadcast mDNS traffic received on one interface to other interfaces. But it's a kludge, you need a linux VM to start with and then for every VLAN you need an interface inside that VM...
 But Cisco routers & switches can do this on their own, here's a simple configuration with 3 VLANs:

 The reason I ask is because I’m anticipating a discussion this year on moving into a salaried position and I sort of want to gauge what others are making.
 As it stands right now I made $70k last year (lots of OT, base salary is really ~$58k), I’ve been in the field for 2.5 years and I’m based in Michigan.

Our HR/Accounting people are concerned about giving me Domain Admin rights because I would then technically have access to all the secure employee private information and company financials and they aren’t sure how to handle the legality.
 How do other companies handle this? Do Admins have to sign NDAs or something? I worked at my previous job for 10+ years and don’t remember what I may have signed when I started.
 EDIT: everyone had their related and justified comments but no one has really answered the question. What does your company do? Did HR have an NDA for you to sign? The people in HR in my company have never encountered this before and are unsure how to handle it. It’s not that they are trying to prevent me from accessing it, they just don’t know how other companies do it.
 EDIT2: I work in the US.

 Also, I wonder if there is something similar that we could rackmount larger gear.

 The AP can only do 2.5 but hooked to a 1gbit link. I've done 105M runs and was able to do 5Gbit, 10gb was unstable, although I didn't ground the connectors for that run.. 
 Curious on your thoughts, or should I try a different approach? I have 120 but very very little space at the destination (light posts with mini enclosures). 
 Thanks!
 Edit: Media converter it is. It is what it is. I found some nice compact weatherproof converters that should do the trick. Power it from a small 48VDC PSU. Expensive but fits the enclosure.
 Thank you all for your help. Pretty cut and dry.

Our small Meraki network consists of three schools pretty close together, one more Elementary school the next town over, and one more Elementary even further away. The network originates in the Middle School and runs to all the others before getting routed back through the middle school. I want to make sure each schools' network is getting the max amount of bandwidth. I am seeing on our main MX switch that both the nearby elementary school and the high school only have one fiber cable going to each, it just looks like one strand and the other socket next to it is empty. Should I be looking to get another fiber strand going to each? And beyond that, should I look into upgrading the fiber cables that go between all the MS225 switches in our schools? Thanks for any insight.

Maybe. They sounded very exasperated and said they couldn’t really find a straight answer anywhere.
 After a couple of days, neither can I.
 MIM EoL is 2029’ish so yeah that makes sense. Cloud is the future anyway. Yada yada.
 What the hell do you do when you’re building an air gapped environment? I’m not against using something like Entrust Identity Enterprise but prefer to stay as native as possible. 
 Does it make sense taking out new Azure P subscriptions just for MIM? How would that even work for an environment with no outside connection other than a single bastion host? Would you still be buying the “full” MIM16 product or would it be a gimped package?
 What would your approach be for a “ground up” engagement like this?

 This is the (mostly) safe location to talk about the latest patches, updates, and releases. We put this thread into place to help gather all the information about this month's updates: What is fixed, what broke, what got released and should have been caught in QA, etc. We do this both to keep clutter out of the subreddit, and provide you, the dear reader, a singular resource to read.
 For those of you who wish to review prior Megathreads, you can do so here.
 While this thread is timed to coincide with Microsoft's Patch Tuesday, feel free to discuss any patches, updates, and releases, regardless of the company or product. NOTE: This thread is usually posted before the release of Microsoft's updates, which are scheduled to come out at 5:00PM UTC.
 Remember the rules of safe patching:
  
Deploy to a test/dev environment before prod.
 Deploy to a pilot/test group before the whole org.
 Have a plan to roll back if something doesn't work.
 Test, test, and test!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello! I know, I know... Unifi, bleh... But still, does anyone know how Unifi's IP conflict detection works under the hood?
 ​
 The scenarios are that Unifi switches and access points are being used. In no case is a Unifi gateway being used and so some other DHCP server is being used, either firewall of a different vendor or Windows Server.
 ​
 The reason I ask is because, while the feature of IP conflict detection is certainly useful and certainly sometimes correct, it also seems to be sometimes erroneous. 
 ​
 For example, sometimes there will be an alert for an IP conflict, and thorough checking is done and through manual checking there does not appear to be an actual conflict. 
 ​
 In another example, sometimes it will alert that there is an IP conflict on X subnet, but not specify which IP it detected in conflict. In what scenario would a Unifi switch or AP be able to detect "a" conflict but not a specific IP that is in conflict? 
 ​
 Anyway, I could guess what mechanisms and logic are being used for IP conflict detection, but it would be helpful to know actual fact as to what's triggering the alerts, to help identify if it is an erroneous detection or to help track down the offending device(s). In many cases the networks are far away and being managed remotely, so just going onsite and tracking things down physically is not always an option.
 ​
 I've searched online but was not able to find much of any information at all about the internal workings of this feature. If anyone knows some details about it, I'd be grateful.

 I am not a networking expert and am a bit out of my element. So, I'm looking for a bit of high-level guidance and appreciate your time. 
 We have a networking partner we've been working with to upgrade our infrastructure to Meraki appliances. We have MX68CWs (spokes) at each branch and an MX105 (hub) at our HQ with site-to-site VPN setup. 
 Our networking partner is telling us that Cisco AnyConnect cannot be used with these appliances and that we must use native VPN clients built into Windows and other supported operating systems. Yet, this documentation states that all these models are supported for use with AnyConnect. Note that we also use Duo Security and SAML for MFA-protected SSO logon to AnyConnect. 
 Is our networking partner correct?
 EDIT: Thanks so much to everyone for your detailed responses. I appreciate the help. I will now push back on my networking partner.

 ​
 I have a question for fellow EU admins. Can you setup automatic forwarding from one personal email address to another. This is blank rule where all emails are forwarded. Let's assume that both parties have agreed to this.
 ​
 Bonus question: If we assume that we can, what happens after one of the parties leaves the company, can the forwarding rule be kept ?
 ​
 I know this is question for lawyer more than sysadmins, but I was wondering if anyone had experience with such requests.

Olddomain.com - points to three correct forwarders
 Olddomaintest.com - points to three correct forwarders
 Newdomain.cn - points to four incorrect forwarders
  
Of those four forwarders, two point to DCs that were decommissioned over a year ago, and the other two are IP addresses that neither I nor the lead engineer have any clue about, as they're not even on a Windows subnet.
 I've tried deleting them and replacing them with the correct forwarders, but am consistently running into an error message "The data on the conditional forwarder failed to set. Access was denied."
 This is what I've tried so far:
  
Domain admin account, through DNS
 Added the DA account to DNSAdmins
 Tried dsacls "\\servername\CN=MicrosoftDNS, CN=System, DC=domain, dc=com" /G DNSADMINS:GA /I:T, to confirm the DNSAdmins group had full access
 Verified that Domain Admins have full control to DNS via DNS
 Verified that Domain Admins have full control to DNS via ADSI Edit
 Tried adding myself to Enterprise Admins
 Looked in Event Log (can't find anything at all)

 Does anyone have any suggestions?

 With legacy LAPS we were able to provide the password for longer periods of time to some software engineers. The 24h limit is really not practical in our case. :/

 When a scan is attempted, the scan log is printed; email server response: 530-5.7.0 Authentication Required.

The mail we are using is set to access less secure applications but generating the app password did not help. The problem seems to be that the server can't recognize the device for some reason.
 So I tried using smtp2go where the only way it works is that the user has to manually type in the smtp server authentication credentials each time they scan, because there is no way to enter them in the printer? Is there any way to solve this so that it is not necessary to enter those details every time I print? 
 Is this a problem of the model or me? Is there a more advanced approach to this problem that could help?

 User details:
  
Primary UPN: [name@oldcompany.co.uk](mailto:name@oldcompany.co.uk)
 Licences: Microsoft 365 Business Premium, Teams Business Voice
 Laptop: Signs in with [name@oldcompany.co.uk](mailto:name@oldcompany.co.uk) - AAD Joined
 Shared Mailbox: [name@company.co.uk](mailto:name@company.co.uk) (using some magic around the SMTP address so that it matches the primary (so john@ is both from a receiving perspective)
  
They now want to shift everything so that newcompany.co.uk is the UPN, with the old company becoming their shared mailbox. 
 I would like to achieve this with the most minimal amount of disruption but have no idea where to start without breaking things. 
 They use SPO and OD also, so this will be a consideration.

 So the very first question WSL vs HyperV,
 As far I know WSL2 uses HyperV now to run its VM. So kind of a moot question but maybe I'm missing something.
 Second is WSL2 permissions,
 As far I know WSL VM inherits windows permissions and user, with enhanced container isolation we fix our other issues. Network is bridge so same rules should apply.
 Anything else Im missing? I don't us to be a pain for the actual sysadmin. We will responsible for maintaining our container and VMs.

I have the impression that they just open tickets, but after meetings, there are no solutions, and they just close them. It seems like they have a system of scheduling meetings, having a chat, and quickly closing the ticket. Every ticket means money, but they are not solving issues. Pointless.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a program that's written in python and its sending its logs to the local rsyslog. And my local rsyslog is configured to connect in a tcp fashion to a remote rsyslog. Now the thing is that I want to know when my local rsyslog is connected to the external rsyslog so that I can show it in my python program. I know that rsyslog has this property for imtcp called 'NotifyOnConnectionOpen' but this will log its connection on the remote rsyslog. And I don't have access to the logs on the remote rsyslog. Is there a way to get it on my side? 
 I know that I can find if it's connected or not with ss -tunp but that seems like a lot of trouble to go through just to automate the process of finding out if the tcp connection is up. And it's very hard to scale up when I have multiple remote rsyslogs.
 I don't know if this is the correct place to ask this question but hey, a shot in the dark.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So our the Problem is as it follows:
 Our Cert on our vSphere server (win 2016) run out the other day. We cant login with our domain users because we always get the error "please input your crendetials" even after inputing them.
 So i tryed changing the cert which the server already got from the ca and ran into a even bigger problem.
 With the the "C:\Program Files\VMware\vCenter Server\vmcad\certificate-manager" manager. Not a big problem i thought as i run the setup i came across another BIG problem. After selecting 1 for changing the cert the setup asks you to put into your pw for "administrator@vsphere.local" and yea we lost that somehow.
 Okay next step trying to reset the "administrator@vsphere.local" user acc. I used the "vdcadmintool" tool tot reset the pw. Which worked BUT when i try to log into the acc via the webinterface i always get "wrong username or pw" so as it now stands i cant login with my user due to the cert problem and when i try to change the cert i cant login into the local admin.
 Have any of you ever experienced such problem? Which pisses me of the most is that resetting the "administrator@vsphere.local" account gives me a pw but that just doesnt work.
 Oh we are using vSphere 6.7
 So googeling a few yours brought me nothing so now my hope is with you guys.
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have been tasked with upgrading our 2012r2 servers to 2019 and they are 2014 SQL servers as well. 
 I have read some google articles on the upgrade. But most are either just in the server OS or SQL. Not them together. I know SQL has to be upgraded too. All servers are VM’s and I am obviously going to take snapshots. 
 I have never upgraded a SQL server and I am a bit nervous and I am definitely not a DBA. 
 I according to what I read it sounds like I upgrade the server OS first (2012r2 straight to 2019) and then the SQL (2017?)? Is this the proper path? What should I look out for? Any gotcha’s? 
 It sounds relatively simple and it’s either going to work or it’s not and I have to revert and do a migration which I REALLY don’t want to do. 
 Thanks in advance.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of our clients has a fully licensed 365 account that they plan on using with a site chatbot, and the problem is that MFA is keeping the account from working properly on the side of the chatbot provider. 
 In the past we'd have made an App Pass and it'd all work swimmingly but that's no longer an option. So my next idea was turn off MFA on the account and just make a conditional access policy to keep it secure, but no dice, even when I disable MFA on the account it still prompts for it both on that account and any other account I disable it for/bran new test account so I'm getting the impression that:
 A. You cannot disable MFA per user any more
 B. There's a policy enforcing this from outside 365 as currently no conditional access policy is enforcing this on everyone
 I know that they have manage engine and supposedly this may also be enforcing it somehow, never touched ME before, and frustratingly the person at the client who set it up left with no documentation so now I'm trying to work it out with 1 IT guy they have left.
 Literally anything to point me in the right direction would be helpful

Call me lazy, but I am not a very deep sysadmin. I use linux on my main, but sometimes find myself having to do things like setting up a node stack on an AWS EC2 instance, with a specific flavor of linux. I love command line, but I've always dreamed of not having to spend half my time looking up the commands to run for the same thing on different systems.
 This brings me to my script. I have already found a ton of use cases and usefulness out of it and it has only been an evening! I am sharing here the github as I have made it open source, and a friend of mine has also made a windows port of the script called wombat.
 Please let me know what you guys think as sysadmins. I know that using AI is basically cheating, but for someone who's not really so much sysadmin it is good. I also made it so that it saves the generated scripts in the scripts folder so it is easy to use as a reference/cheat sheet for commands in any OS/shell.

 I have a new manager which luckily supports me but there's no way I'm going to get help or a second FTE due to budget. The way I see it, I'm the IT manager/sysadmin without the title/pay and skills.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm Studying for the CCNP-Service Provider and I'm trying out H-vpls / e-tree n-pe redundancy design. I'm following along with Cisco docs but I'm stuck. I've been troubleshooting for the whole day with no success.
 Here's where I am.
 My bridge-domains have a Mac stored from their cpe but I can't see them being forwarded to their xconnect peers the NPEs. The x-connect is showing up up and the NPEs vfi are showing up as well. It seems all vfis and x-connects peers are up but I'm not seeing the upes exchanging their mac's or mac's in the bridge-domain of the NPEs. I've tried pinging end to end to watch / capture icmp debugs and wireshark analyze the traffic but once the traffic from the CPE enters the UPE I don't see any icmp traffic. I've also tried debugging the ingress and egress node with no luck with the various combinations.
 At this point I have no clue what to try next or if the virtual nodes in my cml lab (ios17.03) support H-vpls redundancy. I know that virtual images may have some difficulty imitating l2 traffic. Also the documentation for this topic is sparse so even knowing what to troubleshoot or debug is a nightmare.
 I'm open to suggestions and even recommendations for books about l2vpn Cisco support.
 Here's the doc I am trying to following along with (https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/asr920/configuration/guide/mpls/17-1-1/b-mp-l2-vpns-xe-17-1-asr920/m_mp-hvpls-npe-red-mpls-access_asr920.html)

I'm working as a tier 1 technician for an MSP, but no longer feel that I'm really learning anything. I've been taking time outside of work to learn what I can and do some certifications, most recently being the AZ-104. They like me and are promising a promotion to a tier 2 position once I get one last cert. It seems to me from looking at some other tier 2 technicians that my current responsibilities won't change much at all, just a small pay bump. 
 I'd really like to build up into some cloud engineering or DevOps eventually as I've found the cloud very interesting and I've always loved to code. It doesn't feel like I'll ever get there by just doing what my company tells me to do, but when I look at other job posting I feel so inadequate. Are there certain projects I could do or anything to help build my skills further? I take every chance I can to create PowerShell scripts and automate things and advance my career past helpdesk, but it feels like 90% of my job is "WhAT iS MFa?! i DoNt WANT tHaT!!". How am I supposed to differentiate myself from other helpdesk?

 Today I told my boss and 2 co-workers I will be retired by late Sept or early Oct.
 Retiring and obtaining/preserving maximum benefits will be the hardest project of my entire life.
 I was cruising along, making good money/benefits, WFH easy peasy. But was tasked to "upgrade" an app that was written over 20 years ago (I have been with the org 16 years). I have been trying to wash my hands of that app for a decade. Looking at the git repo, I last made a change 5 years ago (simple link in HTML).
 That just broke me. I am done, I hope my retirement opens up an opportunity for someone younger. I work for a great team within an great org.
 Peace out.

This is where the trouble first started.
 The first issue occurred when I automated a per-interface change in the FMC, something that when configured manually was completely innocuous, and appeared to be the same when automating, but ultimately ended up breaking NAT across the company. Luckily we have very limited use of NAT, but it still caused some minor blips before I was able to remediate. Ultimately it was just seen as a near-miss and a on…]]></summary>

 I'm wondering what this network community thinks of this, as well as what distros are you using? 
  
What distro do you use for your network automation and/or NMS systems (or do you use something other than Linux)
 Do you (network department) have control over the OS used? Or is it prescribed to you by overall management? 
 Are you aware of the RedHat controversy? 
 If you are, and are affected, what are your plans?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I was looking at a redesign of the network where I work. I work in the Energy sector and we have multiple methods of communication across a large regional area of states in the USA. We currently have a mixture of BGP and OSPF routing protocols with route redist at several places in the network. The more the network grows and the more "routing rules" we put in place, the more I think that just going BGP full stack all through the network is a good idea. The issue I have with going forward is that not EVERYBODY on the network staff is fully proficient in BGP routing, and its easy to just slap OSPF on interfaces for them. My issue is that if prefix lists for redistribution are not followed and updated properly, then it still causes issues routing from BGP to OSPF or vice versa anyway. We might as well just BGP it all and attach route preferences using BGP attributes such as weight, path prepending and local preference. 
 ​
 I also think I could make things a bit easier to roll traffic using community values that would be propagated through the entire BGP environment, and use some of those values for path selections and ease of rolling traffic when I get it all scripted for those who may not be as proficient with BGP. My thought was that it would be easier for those folks just to maybe change a community value in one edge router to roll internet traffic, and have all other routers in the environment follow the rules attached to that community value. Hopefully that makes sense. I don't want to over complicate things, but honestly, things are getting more complicated just in the redistribution of routes that are happening today anyhow. It just keeps getting worse the more we grow.
 ​
 Thanks,

 I am currently working on hosting TFTP to provide config files to a phone system. I am currently planning to use solar winds TFTP as the server for the requests from the phone. I'm currently in the testing phase and when I run the command "tftp -i XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX get 1.txt" I get a fairly diverse set of messages from my multiple sources. I'll share them bellow
 From the terminal I am putting the request into I get the following message: "Connect request failed"
 From the Solarwinds TFTP interface I get "Dropped because the peer didn't respond."
 From Wireshark I get a few alternating messages: 'Data packet, block 1 (last)',' read request: File 1.txt, transfer type: Octet', 'error code, code: Not defined, Message: Connection timeout', and 'Error Code, code: Unknown Transfer ID, message: Connection isn't established.' 
 I've turned off windows firewall so nothing should be stopping anything from communicating to the server. I've tried downloaded from 2 different sources, with the exact same issue. Both are on the same subnet, with one being from a computer in a different building and the other being from a computer plugged into the same switch. 
 I will answer any further questions in the comments bellow. Thank you for your help!

I am thinking of semi-retiring, but I don't really want to do gig or contract work. I'm going to see if I can talk my employer into reducing my hours, but if that doesn't work, have any of you been able to successfully transition out of I.T., and if so, where did you land? I don't have any side gigs, either, which probably complicates things a little.

I statically assign an IP address, burn it, reset it, even power cycle it, and no problem. I can accessthe GUI via my assigned address. But a day or two later I go to access the GUI and get a time out error from the browser. I can't even ping it anymore. But when I console in to it, it says it's still has the IP I assigned to it. DHCP is disabled. It is running the latest and greatest SW. This has happened in four different locations/ network (3 production and 1 lab). Even when directly connected with my PC. So, I reset it back to defaults and access the GUI via its default IP address and assign an IP address just for it to happen again. What am I doing wrong?

 We are using SAML with Azure AD as the authentication source for our Google Workspace users. In Google Workspace Admin there is a setting for Chrome devices that will pass users google username through to Microsoft so the users can then just enter their password without re-entering their username. We have this enabled and it is working properly on Chromebooks (which some of users use.)
 I can not find any way to have this functionality for users on Windows devices using a Chrome browser. In Google Admin panel there is no setting I can find that would enable this type of pass of username to the Microsoft login screen.

There isn't anything wrong with Confluence other than we do not use all its features and that it is priced like an Atlassian product. Really, I am just looking for something that can store a combination of text, screenshots, and maybe the occasional video.
 Does anyone have a product they use for a KB that they like? Any recommendations?

 Firstly, the equipment:
 - Router MikroTik RB201 rb2011uias-2hnd-in (Managed by ISP)
 - Switch D-Link DGS 1210 (4x)
 - Phones Grandstream GXP1615 (30x)
 - PBX MIZU running on up to date hardware (16 GB RAM, 8 core CPU)
 Config of network (done by provider):
 - Two VLANS
 - 1 is for PC traffic [tagged]
 - 9 is for VOIP [untagged]
 - Phones are able to passthrough the traffic from PC
 What works:
 - Calling outside from any VOIP phone
 - Calling inside between any VOIP phone (except one, dunno why, every phone and port is configured the same)
 - Transferring calls inside the network
 - According to VOIP provider the call is…]]></summary>

 So we use Exchange (hybrid env), PhishER, and Mimecast to control email phishing spam. I'm now on my second run of a Monday morning where I walk in with 6 phishing tickets that people have reported because 1 spam GMAIL user managed to send some crap to the office, and I already know that more of these will trickle in all day as people see them. We have 400+ users, so it would be a lot.
 Question I have is, as a domain/exchange/o365 admin, is there a tool I *should* have readily available to me that can find and yank emails before these guys have to pop in and find them? I've never needed it before now, so I'm just hopeful.
 Thanks!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I work in IT for a small school system. We're trying to find some workarounds/alternate methods to issues since it's summer and the kids are out. We have a small Meraki network and have a student SSID as well as a teacher SSID, the SSIDs are the same, but the passwords differ by school building. Teachers have been prone to writing their SSID password down on whiteboards and pieces of paper and leaving it where kids are able to see it and make use of it. 
 We're looking to find a way to prevent them from being able to do that, and an early idea is trying to bake the password into the SSID so they never get their hands on it. I was thinking of a splash page for teachers that would require them to sign in with their full credentials once and then be all set, but I think I might need all their credentials in advance which would be likely fraught with potential issues. Can anyone recommend an easier/more effective way of saving teachers from themselves? Thank you!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We're setting up a new EAP-TLS secured WIFI network leveraging NPS and issuing certs to laptops that are largely used off premise via SCEP and NDES. Devices are currently HAADJ (I know!) so in theory could obtain certs directly from a CA but looking to futureproof as ultimately we want to utilise AADJ. In testing we're falling foul of the Strong Cert Mapping without manually/scripting populating the AltSecurityAttribute in AD.
 Nothing I've seen from MS yet as to how they're going to address this shortcoming and I see the final enforcement has delayed until Nov 23. Correct me if I'm wrong but I'm guessing the only viable solution at the moment is to run a scheduled task that looks for certs that have been issued using the specific template and auto populate the AD attributes. If anyone has a fully fledged solution a link would be appreciated or have any insight as to how to work around this?
 Also how do people in their environment work around an issue where a device certificate has expired due to the workstation being offline and it not renewing their cert? Do you have an open WIFI network on premise with only enough access to pull down a new cert via SCEP or GPO?
 This has been asked previously but this thread has been archived so can't bump it: https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/yrb7bu/strong_certificate_mapping_w_scep_how_do_you_do_it/

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a unit that needs to be domain joined, but regardless of user I would like it to have no access to network shares. I tried locking down the firewall to block SMB through a GPO as part of a newly created security group listing only the piece of hardware. I’ve also made the adjustments manually on the unit itself. I’ve put GPOs in place to block the units access to the server, but as it acts as a domain controller as well, this did not go well.
 I’m sure there is someone out there that regularly does this. Making this user based rather than machine based isn’t an option as the unit is in an open area and while users know not to login with their own credentials it has already happened more than once.
 Any help or ideas would be greatly appreciated.
 Thanks

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve been in my Sys admin role for a year now, and since day one it’s been pretty chill (coming from an MSP). I’ve gotten to implement new things and fix broken things. No real KPI, and nothing is really ever that urgent. I definitely haven’t conquered the environment, but it’s mostly pretty simple. I get a lot of time to study, focus on strategy, project planning, etc. 
 I now have the opportunity to increase my income 30-40% at an MSP doing infrastructure work. I know for sure it would be more stressful, but I’d learn a lot. 
 The issue I run into is the typical fear of a new environment and new stress, even though I know it would grow me. Anyone else run into this mindset? I find that I was way more ambitious about IT before starting this role. I’m still only 4 years into my career, but I spent the first three really grinding and studying hard. Now I’m more concerned with just enjoying my life, even if it’s on a lower income. 
 This isn’t really a question. More of an open discussion.

My iPhone is set to backup only on trusted WiFi networks to avoid being throttled by my cell company. Assuming my work’s network is trusted since I spend more time there than I do at home, I’m sure a lot of backups to iCloud happen when I’m at work. Is there any way someone in IT who has access could see what’s contained in those backups? Like contacts, conversations (let’s be honest - photos)? Or does the encryption Apple uses prevent this?

 Minimum password age is set to 0. There was a bad update last year I believe on Server 2019, but our DCs are 2022 and are fully patched.
 There is nothing that seems to fix this, except a simple reboot. And it's random, does not affect everyone when theirs expires. Also, the systems are hardwired LAN, they are not roaming devices that are off the network/domain like roaming laptops.

 We got a big TV in our Entryhall and my boss got the idea that he wants this to be a great display of our company. He wants it to play our Company presentation video and wants things like a live weather map, UV map and Windinformation to be displayed next to the video. Of course everything automated so it can run forever without anyone having to turn it on or off or open anything.
 I've thought about things like a custom HTML Page with the video playing and webhooks to get the Weatherinformation integrated into the page. The Problem is i have never done something like that and don't really know where to start. i got a Mini PC i could use and connect to the Monitor but i don't know what to configure.
 I would be interested if you know some other/simpler ways i could accomplish that goal or maybe just give me some pointers in the right direction.

 One folder is called FINANCE and in that we have FOLDER A
 I need to get a new user to the FINANCE folder and ONLY to FOLDER A inside of finance. The only, messy way I know to do this is to give the user LIST FOLDER CONTENTS to FINANCE folder, then turn off inheritance on FOLDER A and give that user specific permissions to that folder.
 I'm thinking this is the wrong way of doing it but can't think of the better way.

 I have my own domain (foo.bar) registred on Cloudflare and I'm runing a Windows Server 2019 VM with installed AD using the same DC domain foo.bar.
 I issued a certificate request using IIS and created a signed SSL certificate out of Cloudflare while being cautious to use the right CN and SAN's as stated here: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-fs/operations/set-up-an-ad-fs-lab-environment#install-a-server-ssl-certificate
 I have the root certificate installed and Cloudflare issued certificates are trusted. When I install the Cloudflare certificate, I can use it on my machine for websites and such, but when I try to add the certificate in the ADFS installation process it's simply not visible. Even importing .pfx file doesn't work.
 Any idea what I'm doing wrong?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[My company runs critical industrial hardware, and pays maintenance on it. 
 In order to reduce downtime, maintainers can get access to their machines, using our Forti SSL portal.
 Authentication is done with an AD account, that we create for every person allowed to access our hardware, typically with a random password, to be changed at first connection.
 The issue is that hardware is pretty reliable these days, and maintainers only connect a few times a year, at most, and every single time cannot remember the password they set.
 Since things break down in the middle of the night or the weekend, as they always do, it’s always a call to the on-call person to reset the password, which is silly.
 Do you have similar issues? How do you handle that?
 (On the maintainer side, all of them have the same answer - they don’t understand why TeamViewer is not used like everywhere else, but my security colleagues think it is not a good idea at all to allow that on mission critical hardware, and I tend to agree)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We have recently deployed a U6 Pro AP within our infrastructure, which is the sole Unifi device in operation within the organisation.
 One of our main goals with this is to enable the support of a Guest Wi-Fi SSID which supports client isolation to ensure that guests have restricted access on the network.
 I have enabled the hotspot portal to achieve this and configured the settings as needed in the portal.
 Within the Pre-Authorisation Allowances, I have added the IP addresses of the internal DNS servers, the default gateways, along with 8.8.8. However, when clients are connected, they are unable to resolve any hostnames. They can ping via IP.
 Our anti-virus does put its own DNS into the IP configuration of clients. I added this IP as a pre-auth, but I had no luck. 
 As a test, I had amended the AV policy on my laptop to use the static DNS servers within the organisation (also added as allowed pre-auth IPs) and flushed the DNS cache.
 However, I am still unable resolve hostnames across devices.
 Due to the above, the captive portal never displays on the devices connected to the Guest network.
 I can't get access into Unifi support to be able to query this. Just cannot get DNS working for the life of me. I can see DNS queries going back and forth between my laptop and the DNS server via Wireshark.

 Is there any solution to this outside of renaming the on-prem domain or setting up IIS on each DC to redirect to the external website? Yes I know this is also bad practice.

 I already believe this isn't possible. At least not without making a mess so I'm happy to push back and say it can't be done providing I've not missed an obvious solution!

 I have to make an AP join a WLC on a different subnet. I can SSH into the core and access switch that the AP is connected to but I don't know whether I can reach a DHCP/DNS server in that subnet. What is the easiest way to go about this?

 we get a lot of Dell Devices with Windows 10/11 which dont get added to a Domain. All of the devices have several language versions of Office 365, which all need to be uninstalled in order to Uninstall our version of Office 2019. Is there a way to simplify the uninstall process ? The Microsoft Support and Recovery Assistant does that but is not portable and needs a Internet connection, also I did not have any luck creating a batch file for it.

 What would you recommend as a free, open source printserver? It should be as simple and low maintenance as possible. I looked into CUPS, but this seems to be build to run locally?

 Picture of the electrical box:

 electrical box
 I need to move the ONT to the garage because my rackstation / firewall / switches are there. Good news is that the main electrical box has some corrugated tubes connected to different rooms, including the garage. But these corrugated tubes are narrow and have some complicated corners (I've already checked with fishing cable). I need 10gbe all arround and I'm afraid that passing cat6a or cat7 could be a problem, so I am also considering changing ethernet cables to fiber.
 ​
 This rough diagram shows the current config and my initial proposal:
 First propossal
 The required equipment is clear to me, but if I move all to fiber I have no equipment to finish the connections and I do not know if it could be a good idea. Using the fishing cable I measured about 130 feet (40 meters) between the 2nd floor (our office) and the electrical box. If I use copper I guess unshielded cables are not realistic for 10g, but all cat6a/cat7 cables I've been researching are too wide/flexible for the corrugated tube path.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi Guys
 I have a requirement for a copy which I don‘t think Robocopy can address, but would love to be proved wrong.
 The scenario is that our admin screwed up a server migration so we have a bunch of OLD files/folders on our target (that do not exist on our source). However as the server has been used, we also have new files folders that have been created from say “today”
 Is there a way for robocopy (or any other CLI tool) to:
 Remove all files on the target that do NOT exist int the source BUT ignores any files that were created today/ 1 day old / newer than a certain date (Like today’s date)
 I know things like /mir or /purge will delete orphan files on the target, but that will include any files created today
 I also know we can use /xo or /xn but that only applies to the source I believe.
 I don’t think Robocopy can do this…as it’s an unusual request, but hoping i’m wrong.

 I have taken over our Gmail admin account, and is tasked with making the usernames better. People have been running wild and the former admin gave them whatever they wanted.
 Just to give you an idea, we have a person in management with the e-mail [TheDragon@domian.com](mailto:TheDragon@domian.com) and we also have one called [TheCount@domain.com](mailto:TheCount@domain.com)
 I have the following I want to do/need help with:
  
Owners want [firstname@domain.com](mailto:firstname@domain.com) for their e-mail addresses and so be it
 For employees I want to do [firstname.lastname@domain.com](mailto:firstname.lastname@domain.com)
  
My big issue is:
  
We have point of sales pc's with shared e-mails for each store, those are a mess.
 Some are name after what the store sells like [teddybears@domain.com](mailto:teddybears@domain.com) and others are named what the employees think sound logic or cool like [teddybarstoreInCityname@domain.com](mailto:teddybarstoreInCityname@domain.com)
 What is a good naming practice for this?
 Many of our users don't have their own e-mail, since they just use the store e-mail.
 I want every user to have their own e-mail, is this wrong?
 There are no mailing groups, so if you want to mail all the store owners then you have to know who they are, should I setup some groups?
  
Thanks in advance for any help :)

 Clients in my company have problems accessing an internal homepage during certain hours of the day.
 WinMTR shows a foreign IP (198.19.250.2) as first node on the way to the application server. It is not a known IP of our network.
 The problems started around the same time we upgraded to ESET Protect Complete and someone else fiddled around with our Sophos to configure an IPSec VPN tunnel to a different site.
 All clients are Windows 10, the application server in question is Ubuntu Server.
 How can I figure out why the first node is not the specified gateway?
 I blocked all traffic to the foreign IP for now because it seems like an attack to me.
 Hosts file is correct, network settings on the clients are correct, outside of a certain time of the day (~7:30 to 8:30) WinMTR shows the correct gateway and there are no performance problems. I also haven't found the IP in our Sophos UTM config anywhere.Deleting DNS cache or ARP cache does not solve the problem. 2 different AV scanner haven't found anything.
 Any help is appreciated greatly!

 So I've recently implemented Protected Users for a customer's domain. We've added only users with Domain Admin to the group. Aware of NTLM and CredSSP being disabled in these circumstances.
 So far so good.
 Got a bit of a curveball that I didn't realise would be an issue. User reports being unable to RDP onto a server. It turns out the hostname is actually a SQL Failover Cluster. They can log into both nodes individually with no issue, but trying to use the cluster hostname, that should then always forward the user to the active node, will fail.
 It looks like it's throwing an error about the connecting computer not supporting NLA, which I suspect is also caused by Protected Users disabling a bunch of protocols for the included users.
 ​
 Does anyone know if there's something I can configure to get around this, or will users in the Protected Users group have to connect using the hostname of the specific nodes and not able to use the cluster name?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[An email is sent from one domain using Microsoft Exchange Online (entity 1). It is addressed to a recipient who as it turns out also has Microsoft Exchange Online (entity 2).
 Entity 1's tenant is configured with Mimecast Email Protection and uses an Outbound Connector to send ALL email via Mimecast. Entity 2's email protection is unknown.
 Normal emails from entity 1 to external parties (inc. Gmail and Outlook) deliver OK and are received OK. Email headers show the email sender IP is 103.96.23.103 - which is Mimecast. SPF passes, DKIM shows as dkim:entity1server:mimecast20181211 and DMARC is aligned. All green ticks when run through MX Toolbox's header analyzer.
 Emails from the entity 1 to entity 2 however... these are delivered to entity 2's spam/junk folder (this was confirmed by calling entity 2 and asking if they've received the email). 
 Checking Mimecast message tracing, and even getting the headers of the email that entity 2 received (by way of them forwarding back as an attachment) show in the MX Toolbox header analyzer that the sender IP is 104.47.71.239 - which is Microsoft. SPF fails, DKIM shows as dkim:entity1server.onmicrosoft.com:selector2-entity1server-onmicrosoft-com, and DMARC alignment fails. Even though the email appears in the Mimecast outbound logs when a message trace is run.
 It's like the email is being handed directly from Exchange to Exchange even though it's going through the outbound connector and subject to the Mimecast outbound policies.
 How and why is this happening?
 Is the solution to simply add inlclude:spf.protection.outlook.com to the domain's DNS TXT SPF record or is there more required to deal with the DKIM? 
 FWIW - Entity 1's Mimecast and Exchange tenant configuration is as per Mimecast recommendation.

 My work domain is public.workdomain.net.
 I have GPOs set up the way I want them for mydomain. I want to export the GPOs from them, then import them to WorkDomain.
 Questions:
 Will this work as intended? What could go wrong? What would happen if there are templates that I had installed on my test machine but are not installed on WorkDomain? For instance, I know for a fact that Google policies are not installed on WorkDomain, but I'd installed them and had set some Google Policies up.
 I really would like to avoid tedious work of having to Copy/Paste policy settings from one PC to another.
 I do know that there are Backup/Restore options and Import options for each GPO. If Powershell is involved, I'm comfortable with that as well.

 I have been in help desk since 2017. I have been at my current job/company for a year and a half and they have been telling me for a while now they are going to move me to an admin spot. I have been doing a lot of the system admin duties/ job already. But we have had 2 admin spots come open in the last 6 months (1 was a brand new spot) and they didn’t even give me an interview….
 The director is the one wanting to hire me as an admin, but the VP of technology is the one that hired the last 2 guys even thought the director is the hiring manager and supervisor of the spots. VP didn’t even let him in on the interviews that were given.
 I am making decent money but I am really starting to get discouraged and seeing no end to my help desk spots. Every job that comes available say they want 7+ years experience but I can’t get experience with getting hired lol..
 I am wanting some thoughts on what y’all think I can do.
 Thank you.

I had never heard of them and from what I can gather they are a kind of gold standard for IT operations and IT project management. Since a lot of the information I found comes from "Best IT cert " lists on random sites I was wondering do you all feel like it's a journey worth exploring? Mind you the cost for taking a training/foundation exam is roughly $800 to $1000
 ​
 Context about me: I work as a junior sysadmin of shorts in a midsized company. I hope to grow in the company I'm at but where that will take me is fairly opened. I would like to become a network engineer/architect down the line and that is why the ITIL cert piqued my interest

 What's the best way to set up an SLA tracker / Wan failover on a FortiGate without the SDWAN License? Currently, we have 2 ISP and source based ECMP enabled on two 10gb circuits. In a recent outage, the primary wan default gateway was still responding to ping but the carrier had an issue that led reachability failing beyond the default gateway. This inability to reach the internet prevented the route from being removed from the routing table leading to connectivity issues. How do I how make the FortiGate remove a default route if it can't ping Google but the link is still up and the next hop is still responding? Fortigates are running 7.2.5.

 IE: A business grows and requires more IPs for RAVPN users. /24 is in place, but we will need to double this and add another /24. Expanding the pool isn't an option because the IP space is not contiguous.
 TAC says the FTD will exhaust the first pool of addresses before assigning any from the second pool. I am assuming this is probably true but it'd be nice to see it in a document or hear from someone else that this is how it works.

 My CEO is wanting to celebrate every milestone we hit this year and wants to know how to make the computers for all users 'explode' with confetti and celebration when we reach a milestone.
 I told him we could use teams, but he said he doesnt want users to use an app! it shoudl just explode on their screen.....
 ​
 ​
 so.... Im asking for help haha
 ​
 But thinking as a Manager - and someone whose CEO gave him direct instructions I thought, this could be a cool concept....
 We reach a milestone, maybe a user posts praise on teams about making some money and bam, all users get a pop up, some confetti graphics rain overlay over the desktop screen and so the whole company can know at once and celebrate....
 But nonetheless I have never heard of anything like this whatsoever! kind of sounds more like a virus...
 So Whilst I setup a demonstration of Cheers/Praise within Teams for him tomorrow, I thought I would ask the world if they have heard of anything like this?
 Environment is all windows 10. We use Teams. Moving to AAD.
 TL;DR:
 Is there a way for computers to rain confetti and inform all computer users that we have reached a milestone! (literal graphics overlay on the PC - when we manually select it to)

 ​
 My old DC is 2012 so I created a new 2022 server, promoted it and copied all the dhcp/nps etc config over and then transferred the fusmo roles. Everything seems to be working so after a few days I turned my old DC off to see how it would go before demoting.
 ​
 It seems to be perfectly fine, but I have noticed if I run dcdiag I get the below error.
 ​
 [Replications Check,NEWDC] A recent replication attempt failed:
 From OLDDC to NEWDC
 Naming Context: DC=DomainDnsZones,DC=domain,DC=wa,DC=edu,DC=au
 The replication generated an error (1256):
 The remote system is not available. For information about network troubleshooting, see Windows Help.
 The failure occurred at 2023-07-10 07:50:45.
 The last success occurred at 2023-07-07 09:23:20.
 71 failures have occurred since the last success.
 [KITE] DsBindWithSpnEx() failed with error 1722,
 The RPC server is unavailable..
 [Replications Check,NEWDC] A recent replication attempt failed:
 From OLDDC to NEWDC
 Naming Context: DC=ForestDnsZones,DC=domain,DC=wa,DC=edu,DC=au
 The replication generated an error (1256):

 The last success occurred at 2023-07-06 14:49:51.
 89 failures have occurred since the last success.
 ​
 Is this just because I have the old DC turned off and will fix itself when I turn it back on and demote it?
 I also have a second DC running 2016 that has essentially the same error. I am also planning on creating a new 2022 DC to replace that server.
 ​
 Am I safe to demote the old DC and create another DC to replace the 2016 DC and then demote the old 2016DC as well?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So I recently there was a decision in my company, that we'll be switching from CentOS to Ubuntu Server. Okay, management "found" this "new" packaging format, called Snaps, and asked me to investigate, if it would be good for our company to use.
 I never was a huge fan of Ubuntu and Snaps in general, but now, when I dug deeper into it, I'm stunned. Really, it looks like Ubuntu doesn't give a single F about Snaps, allowing them to rot and become unusable.
 Two quick examples, that are ESSENTIAL in app development:
  
Docker - published by Canonical, latest version in snaps is 20.10.24, released April 4th, in Docker APT repo we have 24.0 already, two versions ahead
 Jenkins - published by Snapcrafters (star developer, responsible for example for Gimp, Discord, Android Studio, Sublime), in Snaps latest stable version is 2.290, released IN APRIL OF 2021!
  
Weren't Snaps supposed to be a way for developers to publish official packages, up to date and self-contained? A way to install latest version of software even on older distro release? 
 In my humble opinion, it's just harmful. If Canonical is going to push Snaps down our throats, delete APT versions in favour of Snaps, shouldn't they make absolutely sure, we are getting up-to-date and supported versions of software? Especially, since they advertise Snaps as a great way to install production-ready, stable and up-to-date packages in enterprise environment?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am new to an office and there is an existing setup using Avaya Phones.
 The phones have this weird deal where it will receive a "phantom" phone call. It will ring twice, then stopped. If one answers the phone, there is nothing, there is a beeping (not a fax sound, just a beeping Beep-Boop back and forth). The Caller ID contains a broken string (see picture). When called back, the phone plays the busy tone.
 I have tried looking through Comcasts call logs, no sign of inbound calls. They appear to happen on every line. (we have 9 lines that enter through an Avaya hub.
 I have no idea how to get into the hub (I can't seem to find the IP address) and the calls are getting worse. today they've rung 50 times since the office opened. 
 Does anyone have any suggestions?

 I am trying to setup some resilience in our WAN. We currently have a 100Gb link between two data centres and will soon have 2x 1Gb links to a third site, we currently only have the one. So we will end up with a triangle with the base of that triangle being 100Gb between the two DCs. This 100Gb must stay up at all times and not be affected by spanning tree. Am I correct in thinking that if I make the ports for this Admin Adge this we be the case. I can then enable spanning tree over the 1Gb links and one of those will be blocked and this wont affect the other link?
 ​
 Thanks

I'd like to get more involved in infrastructure as code, network automation, etc. At this point I can write basic python scripts but have no formal CS training. A CCIE on the other hand might be more sought after in the networking world, and would allow me to really drill down on protocols. I'm currently a CCNP with 6 years experience. I'm just worried the newest iteration of the CCIE is very Cisco-proprietary and I work in a Arista/Juniper shop. Which do you think will be more useful for the next 3 decades of my career?

I was setting up co-management to use the SCCM client for unattended remote access on AzureAD only devices but I noticed that they weren’t showing up in DNS forward lookup. They’re all in reverse lookup, they’re in DHCP, DHCP successfully registers non Windows devices in forward lookup but non local AD Windows devices were not showing up. I tried to allow secure and insecure updates in our office to check but that didn’t fix it. The only way I’ve been able to get them in forward lookup is disabling name protection on DHCP. I could get it if only the domain joined Windows devices we imaged to AD didn’t show up but over half our devices are AzureAD already and none of them are in forward lookup. Like I said, I’m not the networking guy and I’ve just been trying to look through all the settings and see what I could find. Anyone have an idea?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm scheduled to have a 3rd round interview for mid-level Sysadmin position (I already got through a great 2nd round interview with the Senior Sysadmin/Hiring Manager)
 The 3rd interview will be with the Jr. Sysadmin and the "Director of Quality".
 I'm assuming the Jr. Sysadmin will be there mostly to see how they like me on a personal level. But I'm wondering what sorts of things the Director of Quality will be asking me (I've never heard of this job title before), and what sorts of questions should I be asking this person?
 Based on the LinkedIn profile of the Director of Quality, they handle a lot of compliance related issues (it’s for a biotech company). But the job listing did not emphasize deep knowledge of regulations (only briefly mentioned knowledge of HIPAA as a “plus”)
 Seems curious that the hiring manager/Senior Sysadmin would send me to an additional interview with both the Junior Syasadmin AND the Director of Quality in the same interview, so I’m kinda confused as to what I should expect from this interview, and what sorts of questions I should ask?

 We are currently paying $5.50/device for around 100 devices. I'm wondering if any other admins have an alternative service to recommend that is either the same price or cheaper and offers some benefit compared to Mosyle.
 There's a fair amount of threads on here about MDM in general but it would need to be one that supports education specifically - so that the Education-specific profiles for Classroom and Shared iPad continue to work.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So right now I am trying to set up some bonded 10G interfaces for a Ceph cluster.
 Switch is a Arista 7124SX running EOS 4.8.6
 I have 3 nodes, each with 2x 10G interfaces. I configured them for LACP and connected them to the switch. 
 It looks like this: https://imgur.com/a/XPEHkhA
 I then configured the port channels on the switches, and they negotiated properly, as far as I can tell. 
 However, I can't ping the servers from each other. None of the ARP requests are getting answered.
 Here's the kicker, I disabled the bond and port channel for one of the nodes, and then was able to ping the other one just fine! So the port channel wasn't messed up, AFAIK.
 I tried it the other way, flip-flopping who had the bonded interfaces, same result.
 So the question is:
 Is it not possible to traverse between two port channels on the same switch? Or am I missing something here?
 I can provide configs if needed, but I think this is mostly a higher level (my brain) thing that's going on.

 You know how we keep bumping into companies where SSH keys and passwords are all over the place? And every user and their dog are using the same key? Revoking access in this scenario is almost impossible.
 When I talk to IT teams, they're like, "Oh, we need some pricey 'zero trust' solution to fix this. And guess what, it's not in the budget." But when I tell them there's a free open-source way to do it, they look at me like I've grown a second head.
 So, to prove them wrong, I wrote this nifty script. It uses PAM, SSSD, and the Google Authenticator PAM module. What it does is, it lets your Linux machines authenticate with Google Workspace, AD, or other IdPs. And the cherry on top? It can even set up 2FA for you.
 Here's the link to my script: https://github.com/smulikHakipod/idm-ssh-configurator
 I'm hoping some of you find this useful. Or at least, I hope it gets you thinking that maybe managing SSH keys doesn't need to be such a mess.
 Cheers!

 We have different generations of hardware running in different environments (2-3 hypervisor hosts per environment), most of the older hypervisors are running Intel Xeon, with the more recent servers running AMD EPYC.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 We have a couple of laptops that were given out during lockdown. Some are joined to the domain, some are workstations but user logged in with their Azure AD account and some are logging in with a local user account but accessing Office 365 with their credentials
 They are all going to be Azure joined laptops now. Is the best plan:
 1) Domain joined - wipe and reset and log in at OOBE
 2) local login - same, wipe and reset? Or can they login in with Azure AD credentials and enroll?
 3) logged in with Azure AD credentials. Can I "just" try enroll this to Intune to make them a corporate laptop?
 I'm looking for the cleanest way, even if it will cause more work in the short term.

Although, the work lifestyle in the IT Administrator job looks very laid back while the IT Support role looks pretty daunting. I suppose that would be due to how big the business is. Overall my skills in IT is on par with IT Support level 3 and my IT Administrator skill set is rather lacking but the person who wanted to hire in me in the IT Admin role told me he feels that i will be able to do good things and learn in the company.

 The place I work at (a bank), uses BMC CM for patching desktops as well as laptops and while the desktops are easy, laptops are a huge pain. They always seem to be behind and take a long time being patched. 
 I'm interested in how you professionals do it. Windows update? Deferred updates? Another patch management software maybe? Or maybe even organizational policies enforcing users to keep their devices updated? 
 Would love to hear your ideas/opinions/experience with this!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey,
 So recently we purchased 3 laptops - hp elite book g9. We have the e5 license for all devices. 
 Tried both windows 10 enterprise iso and pro iso 22h2 and even windows 11 22h2 pro,with the same issue. 
 It's having a weird behaviour every time i reinstall/and enroll it to the domain.
 Most often there is a process called vmemm taking up upwards of 1.5 gb of memory.
 Another is when Microsoft application guard goes upto 90% and fails and loops edge opening. On some resets this is fixed.
 This issue happens on all domain join after reset. after awhile the whole desktop freezes up, like not being able to click on the taskbar or desktop icons, but if I press the win key it fixes this desktop and task bar. But issue appears again.
 Our usual laptop enrollment goes like: * reset * change name, restart * create admin account * run a basic Ps script that disables few functions) * enroll to domain using user account * switch user 
 Keep resetting it because I can't seem to leave the domain either. When I try to leave and provide the password it says its incorrect.
 The laptops work fine before domain join. I tried enrolling another old lenovo laptop, it's able to join, leave and reset with no issues whatsoever.
 On Monday I'm gonna try an older iso like 20h2 and update it to the latest version instead.
 Any thoughts will be much appreciated.

So I have been doing IT support/Helpdesk for about 5 years now ever since I started college. I have a bachelor’s in IT which I just finished focused on networking which I completed last December and have Comptia A+ and net+. I want to get out of Helpdesk/IT support role and go towards Sysadmin or cloud engineering role and possibly eventually go to cyber security track. Right now I am making 61k and Helpdesk does seem to eventually would top off at 70k possibly. 
 I want to break into 6 figures (eventually maybe make my own business in IT)
 So what can I do? What else should I learn? What certs I should get? What should I learn more while still working in IT support role? Also whatever I have to learn, how much can I avoid coding especially advance coding (not really big fan coding on a computer a whole day and practice leetcode all the time like some of my coder friends do)

 My current title is a Application Administrator. My responsibilities currently involve rolling out any new software purchased within IT or by any of the other departments in the organization. This requires working the data center team to get a new virtual server setup, the network or security teams to allow clients to access the application if necessary. After rollout of the application we try to be first point of contact for troubleshooting any issues and scheduling patches/upgrades. As of right now me and my team handle about 60 or so applications and list doesn't seem stop growing. 
 The reason I want to make a career change is that I feel that I am not learning anything I can transfer anywhere else and the tasks and daily work are generally not very fulfilling. I have other things I do outside of work with my homelab I think are more interesting to me, specifically all the stuff I can do with my proxmox server.
 I was considering maybe getting a vmware cert but I am not sure where to start or what the job market for a entry level vmware engineer/admin looks like. If anyone with experience in that field can let me know what is involved in the getting the cert and what day-to-day of the job would like, it would be greatly appreciated.

 Since this is a the future of Windows File system, I thought I'd give it a go. It's has been 2 days and so far so good but with some interesting trade-off. 
 It's either psychological or just the some executions (mainly read/write tasks) are slow compared to NTFS. Some apps on MS store aren't installing such as snipping tool, but the rest are OK; only a few hickups.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we are moving to the office of our parent company soon and I got the opportunity to redo the entire network stack there since the current setup has a lot of issues and I am looking into what kind of hardware I should be getting. 
 Currently their network consists out of 9 Unifi switches, a unifi security gateway and 12 Ubiquiti UAP-AC-Pro access points for roughly 100-150 clients and they are having wifi drops constantly. I am guessing that the current APs simply can't handle the density and having all settings set to auto won't help either. 
 The office doesn't need much in terms of complexity, there will be 2 different networks, one whi h does basic internet access and the other connects to a more restricted network. For now they'll get seperate SSIDs, but eventually we'll be moving it to a RADIUS assigned VLAN setup. 
 So currently I am looking into another Ubiquiti unifi setup since it has served me well personally, and I do like the centralized management interface. But I want to make sure I am making the best choice here. Preferably I like to keep the single pane of glass interface for switches and wifi, but it's not required. I do need switches which do POE+ and can aggregate to a central 10g switch for distribution since we have a high bandwidth backup server. 
 What kind of setup would you guys go with? Any recommendations?

However, IP addresses tend to change with DHCP (especially for machines that get turned off when not in use) so it makes it a pain to find and access them. Fixed IP addresses may be possible but would be difficult. Is it possible to open a webpage by mac address instead of IP? It would be awesome to just be able to bookmark a specially formatted URL or something that won't change with DHCP. It gets more complicated as we add more machinery.

 Would it be a red flag to have an RHCSA if you have no 'professional' experience with linux?
 I would like to maybe retake one of these - does anyone have advice on all-around useful certifications / things to know before you are a sysadmin ?

 I have heavy experience with windows but the only real professional experience I have with linux systems is my labbing experience.

 We need to test an 80KM length of dark fiber, and I had a couple of questions about accurate testing. We need to make sure our length test is within 1KM as we need this data to choose what dispersion compensation module we need.
 We have an OTDR but really the main question I have - which seems to have very fuzzy answers out there - is what length launch cable I need for testing an 80KM span. I get answers like “1000M, 2000M or maybe 4000M” - but no good way to calculate it, except by using pulse width, but even that isn’t clear on what the best pulse width should be.
 Any tips on the following would be appreciated:
 launch cable length? do I really need a receive cable, and if so, what length? pulse width settings? We have an auto-mode but would like some discussion of the best settings here Thanks in advance for any help!

Is there an application that works with 0366 that we can install on their PC to authenticate instead? We looked at Authy but we can't find a way for it to work with 0365. 
 Any suggestions, fire away!

Bit of a noob question here: it seems like a lot of people here are actively applying and seeing what's out there while happily employed at their current job. What do you do about the reference check/awkward situation where a potential employer might contact your current employer during the process? Does this happen?
 Edit: this is my first industry relevant position out of school

 Couldn’t i just say if it is coming from lap-001 then do not ask for mfa.
 I figured mfa really shines if a password is stolen and used elsewhere.
 I don’t anticipate a password being stolen and a user’s physical laptop also being stolen.

These are mostly targeting ET Exploit Realtek SDK with attempting to gain admin privileges. 
 How normal are these? Is this something to worry about? Also why is basically only this switch getting so many attempts and not any other device? The Switch firmware is up to date.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys, I had a debate with my cybersecurity expert recently about updating one of our software. 
 We use GLPI (ITSM software) and it recently got an update with some security fix, while I'm aware we do need to do it at some point. My CS colleague and I were arguing about when to do it. I would much better prefer to wait until all our 10 used add-on are tested then updated (that may or may not take a while) while he would test and get rid of the un-updated add-on or if not possible use another soft which have the feature we need without needing to use third party add-on which are prone to not get updated as often. We are pretty early in our deployment so it still make more or less sense to change software. 
 I get his point which is that it's absolutely terrible not to correct a known cybersecurity risk for some feature but these feature are all needed for our use case and I know that updating when using multiples add-on can get messy quickly. We didn't setup a test environment yet, we plan to set it up as fast as possible to see if these feature do break. What seems clear to me is that the same issue will arise for each of our app later down the road. 
 How do you guys tackle updating software in your company especially when certains third party features might break, do you simply get rid of it ? Do you develop yourself these features so that maintaining it is less an issue ? Would you use a software that would support theses features natively (if it exist) ?

 Anyone know of a good IT asset inventory / asset management tool that might work for us? We are looking to gather info such as make, model, software installed incl. versions.
 Including mobile devices / BYOD.
 We already use InTune, so thinking maybe we could utilize that inventory &/or pipe into the asset inventory tool.
 We want to utilize the asset inventory to improve our IT and Security functions (mainly to streamline processes such as vuln. management, patching, software licensing oversight)
 Any guidance would be appreciated ! Thank you.

 I am from the government sector but on the county level onsite. This position would be remote and they would sponsor a top secret clearance YAY! I heard it could take some time to get everything in order, so what should I expect? When should I tell me other job? When should I expect my equipment? When should I expect my first paycheck? 
 I heard the work life balance is great and in general it looks like the sysadmins I know that work for my county do the bare minimum of their contract in order to satisfy the requirements of butts in the seat. They don't get micro managed and if something doesn't work, they don't know how to fix they generally just sit on their hands until it can get fixed. 
 I also would like to move up from sysadmin to cybersecurity at one point maybe working with the same company. Any other insights or tips would be greatly appreciated :)

 I was curious to see what type of recommendations you have for securitywhile setting up a new Microsoft 365 enviorment for a Enterprise ( arroud 20 office staff, and about 100ish remote / site based employees ). The I.T show is mainly a one man show, with a a couple L1 Helpdesk employees. 
 FYI : I have approval for Microsoft E3 plans for every user which includes Azure P1
 What security defaults would you reccoment to tweak to maximize security and accesibility in the transition, from local stoarge, imap for email, and 3cx for calling and a local DC to 100% cloud based ( sharepoint, teams, exhchange, intune etc ). 
 I have previous experience in low level managment of these systems but not really sure about how to lock down these systems for security and a smooth transition/rollout.
 Thanks in Advance!

How do you add newly added Arc enabled servers to periodic assessment automatically. Using policy definitions? Trying to implement automation here. I know you can manually select each machines and enable periodic assessment.
 How to patch servers in batch to avoid outage? Create a dynamic group using tags or resource group and attach a maintenance schedule to this group? (Say for example group servers as three batches and tag them based on their groups. servers will be added to groups based on tags and each group have it's own maintenance schedule. Maybe fist batch get update on week 1 and second batch get update on week 2 and third batch of mission critical servers get patched quarterly).

To drill down into what I'm really looking to see is if IT teams will use this windfall of funding to change the architecture of their network from the known "big box" players to a more nimble and economically viable approach such as Disaggregated White Box Networking. 
 I've had more conversations with Network Managers or equivilent over the past 15 years and the one thing I've probably heard the most was they will drop Cisco the moment they are able. This is obviously easier said than done. For networking professionals I've spoken to in the service provider space I've heard the same sentiment with Juniper often replacing Cisco as the big bad.
 I don't want to know the name of your company, just curious if there is any talk of either going Whitebox for the additonal buildout of the network or even a plan to completely rip out Cisco or Juniper in a lattered approach over the next 3-5 years as an example.

When our latest server upgrade came into play we did the usual and got multiple quotes and went with a new reseller because they gave us a steep discount for us using other services of theirs. When I informed the rep we were using a different vendor for this purchase I was told that I would be reassigned to a new account manager because of this. Anyone else have anything odd like this??

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’ve posted about this before, but I’m back with more answers but still no resolution. Long story short, Apple devices spoof their MAC by default. Each time the client roams from one WAP to the next (even under the same SSID) the mac address changes. In theory, this sounds great! 
 Here’s my problem, each time the MAC address changes a new DHCP request is sent. At smaller facilities this typically doesn’t cause much issue. However, at our larger facilities this is causing our DHCP pool to run out of IPs. 
 In an attempt to free up IP space, I’ve turned the DHCP lease time down to 1 minute and increased that network to a /22. On average, this network has around 150 users, at its busiest around 200. My attempt to relieve the issue worked for about 2 hours, then the DHCP pool was full again. 
 Think about it this way, if 1 person walks across the facility and passes 10 WAPs with their phone in their pocket, they’ve just leased 10 different IPs. Now imagine 150 people constantly running around a hospital. 
 I’ve been racking my brain over this for months, and without implementing an MDM I don’t think there’s much we can do. Thoughts? Suggestions? Anybody else ever run into this issue?

 I'm trying to find a way to filter out specific RADIUS attribute in authentication and accounting messages from NAD (IOS XE) to RADIUS Server (ISE).
 I'd like to reduce the unnecessary overhead caused by Framed IPv6 address attribute which is getting snooped from client devices.
 I don't want to disable IPv6 on the client devices but after integrating ISE API with 3rd party firewalls, I'm seeing v6 Link Local addresses there which are not useful in our enviroment.
 I've managed to sort this out on switches by tweaking Device Tracking policy but I also want to get rid of these addresses on our Catalyst WLC (IOS XE).
 The WLC is centrally authenticating clients to RADIUS server.
 I read a bit about RADIUS attribute lists and I thought I could use that but I didn't succeed.
 Did anyone of you try to deal with it this way?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, I was laid off 3 weeks ago or so. After a slow start to the process, finally had a few interviews today.
 I was....taken aback at a job requirement, not in the job description, that was dropped in the interview. Now, in the job requirements, it DID says, "Has to be OK working PST hours". I am on the east coast. I mentioned it to the recruiter, he said as long as it mostly overlapped it wouldn't be a big deal. 
 After rapid firing me through....7 or 8 different tech stacks, the interviewer (my potential future boss), asked about how I did standup previously. 
 I told him we had a standup, typically in the morning. 
 He said "Well, we have a daily standup, but since 4 of our members are in India, it's at 9 AM India time and its required every day, would this be a problem?"
 (I originally thought it was 9:30 EST, i was mistaken, it's 11:30 PM EST). I said I'd have to think about it. I mentioned I have no issue doing an asynchronous standup and he was adamant that it was a requirement. I repeated that I would have to think about it. 
 This isn't something common right? I certainly get with distributed work force there can be some odd hours, but requiring a daily standup EITHER part of the world where one has to be up at 11 PM local time is unreasonable. has anyone seen this or had to do this as part of their job? I'm withdrawing my name from consideration for the role, I am just curious if others have seen this.

 I’m thinking :
 1)employee hasn’t logged in in 6 months and we have a 90day retention policy, then they don’t need an E5 license, or if they’re not issued a computer (truck driver, welder, etc a person that at most sends an email but doesn’t touch excel) then F license. 
 2) Employee has both an E5 & and E3, then something is wrong and they don’t need both.
 3) Service accounts not sign in’ing in 6 months, needs a review. 
 4) Conference room, licensed for Teams Premium or another license type that costs, if not used, in 3 months, needs a review .

 When this happens and I go into explorer there are no drives with the little x on them to indicate that they are not reconnected, and all the mapped drives (2 of them, from a login script) are mapped fine.
 I just went through all of my GPOs to see if I can find some indication in there as to what is going on, but there are no drive mapping settings anywhere in my GPOs.
 I searched the Windows logs to see if I could find more details on this, but I cannot find anything.
 And lastly, I do have the "wait for network connection" option set in my GPOs, so it's not that.
 Since this happens on every windows machine I log into, the mappings have to be coming from somewhere in AD, but I cannot find it.
 Any suggestions on how I can work out what drives are being mapped so I can kill this message?
 EDIT: Thanks to /u/bigtime618 who was spot on in identifying the issue. My login script maps a share with different credentials from that of my user account, and this is what caused the issue. To fix it I just needed to add /persistent:no to my net use command in my login script.

 I am on the beginning on my network journey and would appreciate some advice regarding VLANs.
 I am mostly surrounded by TP-Link, Unifi, and other low end devices, and often time they are geared towards SOHO use, but hey... it is what it is. 
 I plan the VLANs, what endpoint goes where, but my mind stops working when I am given a SOHO switch which can separate VLANS,i can set wich port is trunk, wich port is a member of a specific VLAN... 
 However when it comes to setting it's own management IP address, I can not set a VLAN. So that device is reachable from all VLANs knowing it's IP address, or you have to allow untagged packets on the entirity of the network and call the untagged network the management network?
 ​
 What is the best practice for dealing with low-end switches if you want to separate the production traffic from the management traffic?

I had to fight to get us moved over to M365, instead of just letting everyone use their personal Gmail address for company email. Every laptop across the whole company is refurbished.
 I'm my own boss. The only person I report to is the CEO, and he lets me run things. I feel great about what I do. My SMB makes things that people need, and I help make that possible. I am well respected by everyone I work with. I'm paid enough to live comfortably, and I get to go to all my kid's school events. My work-related-stress is easily manageable. I have very little interest in working for a large entity, though admittedly I don't know what it's like to be part of a large enterprise team. I suspect that in some ways it's different and some ways the same. There are probably great enterprises to work for just like there are great SMBs, and terrible ones. I think my setup is preferable, but I can understand why someone would want a more sophisticated environment.
 I'm really tired of seeing derision and disrespect lobbed from one side of this divide towards the other here on /r/sysadmin. I have been guilty of it myself, but no more. I promise from now on to stop and think before I fire off an angry reply. The sysadmin on the other end of the comment may have a totally different perspective on the issue, but they are still my brother or sister in arms.
 Thanks for reading.
 TLDR: Be nice, your department's budget doesn't define your worth as a SysAdmin.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So we introduced a new core stack at our HQ, which was necessary at the time because our new storage needed 10gb networking. 
  
Current core sw IP is 10.177.1.10 on the "switch mgmnt vlan", the new stack is 10.177.1.40 on the "switch mgmnt vlan".
 The new stack has a etherchannel trunk to the current core.
 The new stack's default route is ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.177.1.10
 At that time we were not ready to retire the old sw that is the current core, and it handles all the routing. 
 We now want to retire the old core sw, and do all the routing on this new stack.
  
I know I need to create the svi's on the new core stack (leaving them shutdown till cutover) and any ACL's and ip routes and vlans. And move the last remaining cables plugged into it to the new cores.
 All other switches in the building (about 35 of them) have 10.177.1.10 as their default route currently.
 What's the best practice to get all those sw's pointing at the new core sw stack instead of the old?
 Or is it as simple as changing the new core stack mngmnt IP to 10.177.1.10?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working on an assignment for my Distributed Systems class as part of my CS undergrad, and I need to generate a simulation that demonstrates the differences in efficiency between cloud computing vs edge computing.
 I want this sim to give evidence of the reduction in latency and overall bandwidth that the edge approach provides for one specific context, however I don't really know the best context is to demonstrate this (online information about edge networks seems to bring up self driving cars a lot).
 Another problem is I have absolutely no idea what software I should use, I found a resource with links to a bunch of simulators specifically focused on edge computing networks, but they seem quite obtuse (especially to someone who has a quite basic understanding of networking).
 Is there some kind of "network simulator for dummies" that lets you put together a topology graphically?
 I will admit I am painfully naive to the complexity of this task, and the resources provided to me by my University aren't helpful. Any advice you can give as to what software to use, and where to learn how to use it is much appreciated.

 Since I’m often dealing with problems, most of the time committed by users, to prevent sounding overly critical and not making the individual feel stupid I structure my sentences to add emphasis on the object and what happened to the object rather than the user (subject) or just omit the subject entirely. 
 Example: The keyboard wasn’t plugged in. 
 I could easily blame the user for not plugging in the keyboard by adding them to the sentence, but I don’t. 
 I’m curious if anyone else speaks like this.

 I'm not a common redditor so if I do anything here thats not cool please correct me immediately.
 I have a CCNA and a CASP. CCNA expires end of this month so I'm starting the CE work. Does anyone have any advice for what to use? Last time I used a 60 hour course for the CCNP but I can't remember where it was from. I'm hoping to find one that will cover both the CASP and CCNA CE so I can optimize my time.
 I work for the DOD and have 10 years in the game. Bachelors in theatre and bartender for 10 years before that. I just like to subnet I guess.
 Thanks in advance!

 I find the concept of the toolbox with different drawers (use-cases) really useful. There are so many tools out there that can be used for network automation at various points in the network life-cycle that it's a bit overwhelming when you're trying to evaluate possible solutions.
 The problem is that this presentation is several years old now and I was wondering if anyone has something similar that's more up-to-date? Has anyone recently gone through the effort of categorizing some of the tools that are now out there and their various applications? If so, anyone willing to share their notes?
 I'm trying to evaluate what automation tools I could bring to my environment and which ones might be good candidates for various use-cases.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I'm working up DR/BC plans, and wondering how to approach this scenario. I've heard of a company's entire Azure tenant getting corrupted, or somehow becoming inaccessible for a long time. We've got a hybrid AD, in an Azure VM-Windows Server. We keep files in a server share, as well as in like 50 different Teams/SP libraries. 
 I back up our server shares externally to an AWS bucket, in addition to Azure's built-in backup. I run test file restores once a month. We use Afi to backup mailboxes, Onedrives and Teams/Libraries. But the only backups of our AD are stored in Azure's backup; I've never tried to restore it. 
 Should we consider what happens if our whole Azure/MS365 tenant goes sour? Do companies keep an alternate domain? Testing the viability of restoring AD and Teams to it? Should we have a plan in case Microsoft goes south altogether? 
 Also, we're supposed to do vulnerability scans and network penetration testing, for our insurance policy. Should I be outsourcing DR planning and testing, along with scanning and pen testing? 
 Thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy Friday
 Where are you folks buying S/MIME Certificates for your employees? I'm currently using Sectigo.com but each employee is having to create their own account to order it & we're having to put the company credit card on each employees account. There doesn't seem to be a way to centrally manage it. Is there a better service where we can order certificates for employees while being able to centrally manage them, see expiration dates, etc? 
 Muchas Gracias

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. Throwaway. The organization I work for is trying to restructure IT so that work is escalated more appropriately. Right now it's pretty devil may care but they want/need a more corporate and policy based support structure. We have about 1000 users, about 300 admin.
 Currently, Service Desk kind of handles everything that isn't on a server (and a good bit of server stuff too). My boss and I have talked about a new "T2/3" position that I could take on. The idea here is that Service Desk would be responsible for being T1 and then anything they couldn't figure out or the refining of processes would be escalated to T2. That team would be me and then possibly 2 contractors below me.
 On top of T2 support, the stuff I'd be doing day to day would include:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[For some years we've been using a well-known web filtering provider, but are considering alternatives due to poor support, design decisions they've made with their latest platform and decreasing product quality in the platform we're using.
 Currently we use an endpoint-based filtering solution where traffic is either:
  
Steered to a proxy server running on the endpoint itself (via PAC file)
 Transparently intercepted by a Windows Filtering Platform driver
  
The endpoint makes policy decisions and the traffic is sent to its destination directly. Our requirements (at a very high level) have been to:
  
Block inappropriate categories
 Block security risks based on category
 Provide real-time assessment for potential security risks (e.g. compromised sites hosting phishing pages)
  
We've spoken vendors with varying offerings:
  
Baracuda
 Censornet
 Cloudflare
 Menlo
 Netskope
 Skyhigh
 ZScaler
  
The majority of these vendors take a different approach, where traffic is routed through a transparent proxy via ipsec/gre tunnel. I'm a little wary of this approach from a performance perspective. I understand the various vendors arguments in terms of better peering etc, but wary of further complexity in troubleshooting performance issues for our service desk team (which we don't really have with the incumbent).
 We have a decent remote-access VPN solution and no immediate desire to do anything with it.
 Does anyone have any vendors they can recommend that offer endpoint-based solutions, or vendors to avoid if we do go down the tunnel route? TIA.

 Shopping around for a new RMM. We currently use Action1 because the 100 count free, but I do feel it's somewhat lacking.
 Curious what some of you would recommend for a very small IT team that manages about 65 workstations and 20 servers/devices.
 Ive looked into ninjaOne but I'm scared that price tag is going to be nuts.

Essentially, HR sends out a list of staff movements between units every few months which on the sysad side involves removing the user from their current departmental security group and into their new departmental security group (possibly also OU).
 The script would have to be able to determine which group the user is currently in is the department security group , remove them from it, then add them to their new department security group.
 Ideally the script/tool is easy enough that a non IT person can use that way I can eventually push this task onto HR since they're the ones generating these movement lists.

 I think there is an option for it, but I haven't found it after one hour.
 Could someone kindly assist me with this issue?
 Is there an option in total commander that enables copying files that are over limit?
 Is there any other software that you would reccomend me?
 ​
 I heard that Robocop is good for that, I found some GUI version and will try to back it up that way. I am still not sure if there are some parameters that need to be configured in order to copy long files. I thought that it is integrated by default in Total Commander?

We need to do tunneling for it. I'm failing to understand the point of tunneling. I've read articles after articles like this(https://www.gaia-gis.it/fossil/virtualpg/wiki?name=port-forwarding), but it's not entering my head. Can't anyone who knows the server IP and has company VPN; tunnel and get access to that server? I know they can, but what's the point of that tunnel? They could've just filtered by requests coming via a particular IP say xx.xx.xx.xx to be allowed and reject everything else. What's the point of tunneling?
 What's the problem that tunneling is trying to solve?

 I came up with the idea of auto URL safety checker.
 Use case: When others send you a URL (on Slack or promotion emails)
 The old way to check the safety of the URL you received is: click it, or copy & paste it to the checker
 The new way: you can see if it's safe right after you received it.
 Really need your feedback on it, thanks a ton!

 Looking for the best system or method for employees to state they are working remotely of in the office. We are currently reviewing or fire safety proceures and one major item is determining who is in the building and being able to produce an employee checklist. 
 We have a door system, however 
  
it does not track outoging staff
 Tailgating is a big issue. 
  
We are a heavy office 365 enviornment, so it would be beneficial to integrate for ease into 365. 
 ​
 Was initially thinking an office 365 clock in system that simply requests are you remote working or office working. Allowing staff to switch to remote if they leaving for meetings during the day. currently the line of thinking is a simple power app that will produce a 30 day log. 
 ​
 Note; we are not looking to track employee productivity, soley if they are in the physical building or not.

 The mailbox is used for company suggestions from staff, so the reply is as you'd expect, 'thanks for your idea blah blah', but it appears as an email/notification from "Microsoft Outlook postmaster@company.onmicrosoft.com", and as I said, in its own inbox.
 The problem isn't necessarily that the user isn't getting the message, because we want to change it anyway; the problem is that I have no idea where this message is coming from. As it's a shared mailbox you cannot log into it so auto replies weren't set up this way. Using the Exchange Admin Center also shows that there is no auto-reply set up, and I've tried using the Exchange PowerShell module to Get-InboxRules, of which there are none. 
 Is there anything I'm missing, as I can't think of anywhere else to check where this reply is stored and why it's being sent?

 Thanks for your help!

Every user has a windows log in password. So, if that user wants to use their laptop, they just have to enter their windows log in password. Where does bit locker come in handy then? (ofcourse if they "guess" your windows log in password correctly, they are in your laptop and there's nothing you can do about it?) In the case if someone steals your laptop, they will need your windows login password which they won't have right? So you're covered there. After that, if they take the disk out and plug it in anywhere else, they will need a recovery key that you extracted to an external disk when setting up bitlocker?

 Is that all there is to it?

 iam searching a solution for the following workflow.
 Our Monitoring-System is sending an alert via E-Mail.
 Jira is creating a Ticket for the alert and is sending a notification/invitation to the worker who has shift - jira should getting the information, who has the shift, from a calander.
 If the shift does not respond to the Ticket/Alert in a specific time the next person in shift is getting the information. 
 Is there a free or self-hosted solution?
 I think GoAlert is going into this direction. 
 Our Monitoring-System is Intermapper and our E-Mail-Server Kerio with CAL-Dev.

They can use the private network or the global internet.> My office is a very long building, with stone walls.> I was asked to find an inexpensive solution.I had two ideas:OPTION 1) use a 4G/4G+ router with a SIM, to give connection to the 1 or 2 rooms (stone walls) that have decent 4G signal and ask the employees to move there for connection;OPTION 2) use some USB 4G Modem Dongle. I would buy 2 or 3 and give them to the users that are in the building.I excluded creating a wifi with WAPs; it seems expensive and there's the security server to manage (here we don't even have a Windows Domain).Give me your opinions/suggestions please. thx

 I'm not far into my career, but I'm contracting for a client and they have an environment that is public cloud based, and I'm evaluating the need for engineers to VPN in to utilize the features, like decryption and content filtering, on our enterprise firewall to harden our security stance while working on public cloud resources. Unfortunately we use a firewall which requires licenses for VPN connections.
 Is my thinking wrong here? Is there really no need for remote users to use any kind of VPN when performing their job function?
 The first thing my mind goes to is a MOTM attack on some shitty insecure coffee shop wifi, or poor browsing habits leading to someone's device being compromised. No one seems to be considering this. Is there really no need to have any kind of VPN if defender is installed? They may be using an Azure client VPN, but no mention has been made of this.

 The Problem: We were experiencing difficulties accessing the web interfaces of certain devices on our LAN. After some troubleshooting, we discovered that the root cause was related to the Dell N3200 series switches and their handling of packet fragmentation during inter-VLAN routing affecting mostly clients on the WiFi but also just across Data/Security/Voice VLANs.
 The Solution: Thankfully, we were able to resolve the issue by specifying the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) of all the switches in our network. By setting the MTU to 1532 using the command #sys…]]></summary>

 (I currently have a Windows PC, Raspberry Pi 4 with Linux, and I'm looking into getting a Mac so I'm open to any OS specific USB if that matters)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Is there a simple usb-powered 3-port gigabit switch, or a USB network adapter with integrated 2-port switch?
 Background…
 In my work, I visit multiple sites with my laptop, and connect into our corporate network. Unfortunately some of the sites I visit don’t have a spare network port in the office for me to connect to. 
 My current solution is to carry a 5-port Ethernet switch, and jump-in between one of the existing computers - connecting the switch to the wall outlet, and the existing computer and my laptop to the switch. It works well. However, a 5-port switch is bulky, it also has a wall-wart, which I need to plug in, many sites don’t have a spare power port either, so I carry a power-board which I put between the existing power and one of their devices… yes everything works, but it is a lot of equipment to carry around, and since I will usually only be at the site for a day, it is a pain unpacking and packing up etc.
 If there was a USB-powered switch it would reduce the need to carry a wall-wart and power board (my laptop easily lasts the day on battery, so power for it isn’t a concern), or even better, a USB Ethernet adapter with integrated switch, since I need to carry a USB Ethernet adapter anyway. Then I could just piggy-back in between an existing computer and the wall outlet.
 Anyone know of such a beast? I have googled, and not found anything, but maybe my search terms are wrong.
 Edit. Since many are saying to refer to Corp IT, our corporate IT are aware of the situation, and their recommended solution is “go to a computer store and buy a cheap switch”. They are happy for us to do it, because it is cheaper for the few mobile staff to do that, than for them to get extra outlets wired in at each site that has hit capacity. This is about getting a switch that is smaller and more portable than the typical budget 5 port switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I just started as a junior sysadmin at a new company where they have a dedicated senior security engineer. After deploying a couple of VMs, I noticed that on all pre-existing servers the Windows Firewall is disabled, while I leave it enabled and only open the minimum required ports/protocols. When I asked about the reasoning behind this I got an answer which basically comes down to:
 - It can easily be bypassed by hackers so it's not that useful
 - In a full Windows environment you need so many ports open that you might as well disable it
 - We have a good datacenter firewall (servers are segregated and firewalled in different vlans: mgmt, web, SAP, etc)
 - We don't have the time/staff to figure out the required ports for all servers, and even for new servers it needs to be configured, documented, etc. 
 It felt a bit awkward to react to because I don't want to come across as an asshole-know-it-all right from the start, but I tried to explain my opinion that I don't see it as a magic solution for everything but just an additional layer in the entire security picture. In the end the conclusion was that we keep it disabled to keep it consistent with all the existing servers. Which is fine I guess, it's not what I would do, but it's not my call. To me it just seems weird and contradictory for a security engineer to have this kind of opinion, but at the same time the guy does have a lot of experience, so... Am I crazy? Is this a waste of time and better to just disable?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So...stupid question but if I were to turn on 'strong global encryption' at the firewall and disable weak algorithms then as long as everything communicating across the network accepted the remaining strong methods then we'd be alright, right? I mean, of course I'd want to follow up later on the switches (and GPO for Windows boxes) to make sure I disabled weak algorithms in all the places as well as setting AES strength. 
 I'm mostly concerned about all of the unforeseen consequences though. What will this do to our VMWare setup, will our linux boxes have any issues, printer communication and the like. You never know until it's too late what might break when making major changes like this so any advice/thoughts on the matter are greatly appriciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there,
 one of the customers came lately with the idea to use a cloud-based firewall (FWaaS), e.g., as offered by Fortinet or PaloAlto, instead of a common hardware appliance, e.g., from Sophos.
 I have no experience using FWaaS from arbitrary providers (Fortinet, PaloAlto, uNameIt) but how is such a firewall actually operated? In most shiny white papers, they discuss the removal of the classical "internal <-> perimeter <-> external" architecture, but how is this actually done? Does each internal client simply use some kind of (VPN) tunnel to the FWaaS before routing to the internet or is a site-to-site VPN configured? Is a hardware firewall still in use on the customer network or is it just the clients + router?
 Hope you have some input for me for this issue, most white papers focus more on the marketing than on the technology.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I recently built a lab for testing a redundant edge router deployment for a service provider environment. Initially, I used EVPN ESI LAG with virtual gateway address but also have a lab using VRRP instead. I have found a major roadblock in deploying IPv6 in these environments: there is no state redundancy for DHCPv6-PD. The routers I am using serve as DHCPv6 relays and my CPE uses DHCPv6-PD to request prefixes. The relays snoop the DHCPv6 process and dynamically build routing information to the requestor CPE’s WAN address for the delegated prefix. However, this state is only ever built on one edge router or the other, meaning if one of the routers fails, all routing state for the prefixes delegated via DHCPv6-PD is lost. Even though I have a redundant PE, the redundancy is useless.
 This blew my mind that there was no mechanism for hot-standby of the DHCPv6 relay state. I found an article that Huawei switches apparently have such a mechanism, but looks proprietary.
 I found an ipSpace blog post from over 10 years ago on this topic: https://blog.ipspace.net/2012/03/do-we-need-dhcpv6-relay-redundancy.html
 Anyone found a solution to this problem?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I come from a Cisco background and I'm getting confused about tagged ports.. the goal here is that all ports on my switch are VLAN17 for ports 1-46. Then port 47 & port 48 need to talk to all the VLANS I have, which is 17,19,20&50.
 Port 47 is connected to a WiFi AP that utilizes VLAN 19 for WiFi access, it uses VLAN 20 for Guest WiFi & it uses VLAN 50 for its management IP. So I need port 47 to behave like a trunk and allow all my vlan traffic through.
 Port 48 is the uplink for the switch, connecting it to the rest of the network, so it also needs to be "trunk"-like and accept all the VLANs on my network.
 Does this config look correct to you guys, for an HP switch?
 vlan 17
 name "NEW_VLAN"
 untagged 1-46
 tagged 47-48
 exit
 vlan 19
 name "VLAN19"
 tagged 47-48
 exit
 vlan 20
 name "VLAN20"
 tagged 47-48
 exit
 vlan 50
 name "VLAN50"
 tagged 47-48

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Admittedly I'm not experienced with SQL server. Just wondering what everyone recommends for SQL server best practice with performance as a primary consideration?
 We have an application that uses SQL server as the backend database, and performance has been pretty crummy since implementation. 
 We're replatforming the environment and I want to take best practices into consideration during the environment refresh. From what I've gathered here are some of the changes we'll be making:
  
Separate application server and SQL server to be two separate VMs so SQL server is not fighting the application services for resources
 Create seperate virtual disks for C drive, DB drive, and logs drive (currently everything is just installed under C drive)
 Configure memory allocation settings to equal or greater value of the sum of all of your DB files if possible (it is doable in our env) -- From my understanding with manipulates the SQL server to favor logical reads vs. physical reads?
  
Any other recommendations? Any that I've listed above that are unnecessary/outdated? When setting memory do you set a minimum memory value or leave it at default? Right now our SQL instance max memory is set to 2147483647, should I leave that or set it explicitly to >= to the sum of DB files or does it not matter? When considering storage, we have an all flash Nimble SAN, should I be specifying any settings on the LUN for optimal performance or are those recommendations obsolete with the use of NVMe flash? Any maintenance tasks that can help optimize performance? And lastly, how do I validate that these changes have improved anything? Or rather, what is your method for validating and pinpointing the cause of performance issues in SQL server?

 I work as an HPC engineer on our infiniband networks. For those familiar with infiniband I'm sure you know documentation and and resources in general are thin. I'm looking to setup a pretty complex lab environment at work to do some testing, but I was curious... Does anyone know of a utility like gns3 or packet tracer that is compatible with infiniband architecture? I need to do some testing with routing across multiple networks using the new Nvidia Skyway Gateway's and want a bit of a virtual proof of concept before I rack and cable a bunch of things. 
 Kind of a long shot and a bit of a niche thing, but figured I'd put it out there and see if anyone has any info. Thanks in advance!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey there, 
 I just need to get something off my chest and have a little rant. I'm not even sure what I hope to achieve by posting this, but sometimes you just need to vent.
 I pride myself on being a self-motivated individual who actively seeks out opportunities to learn new things. I even go the extra mile by taking classes outside of work hours. When it comes to PowerShell, I'm absolutely passionate about it. Most of my projects revolve around automation, utilizing PowerShell, APIs, and Power Automate.
 But here's where things take a frustrating turn. Our company got acquired by another company last year, and unfortunately, they don't have many people with skills like mine. So, naturally, they're quite pleased with my abilities, and I've been automating a significant portion of their processes.
 However, recently, something has been happening that I'm not comfortable with at all. Every time I update my manager on my progress, she insists on having two other individuals join the meeting. It's as if she wants me to showcase everything I do to them. It feels like I can't even perform a simple right-click on my computer without those two people hovering over me.
 Now, don't get me wrong—I'm all for knowledge sharing. But here's the issue: the focus should be on "sharing." These individuals have their own projects, and I'm not included in any of them. 
 I think I'm the only person in the entire team who has to do something like this. It feels entirely one-sided. They seem to only want my knowledge without any interest in reciprocating or fostering my growth.
 It's frustrating.

 When I have some slow time at work, network mapping is one of my favourite activities. It is not stressful and I can take my time doing it.
 And it is useful as a part of documentation and monitoring.
 For me at least automated tools and protocols usually leave some gaps in the mapping, so manual intervention is always needed.
 And if you have a network of any notable size, it is cool to see once you are done. 
 What do you think?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ok, so after a rather lengthy disagreement with a few coworkers, wanted to bring this topic to Reddit for some health debate. What is your stance on putting settings into the Default Domain Policy (DDP)? 
 My Stance
 Over the last 12 years of career, my philosophy is, settings in the DDP are settings that are any settings that are universally true and should not ever be overwritten under any circumstances regardless of what those settings are. 
 General Wisdom
 "As a best practice, you should configure the Default Domain Policy GPO only to manage the default Account Policies settings, Password Policy, Account Lockout Policy, and Kerberos Policy. " 
 Supporting Evidence (My Stance)
 - Settings such as "Network Security: Force logoff" are required to be in DDP contradicting their own guidance.
 - AD Engineers I have worked with at previous job specifically stated that guidance was not relevant post Windows Server 2003/ 
 My Argument:
 I deem the setting set in the DDP as universally true under any/all circumstances. Settings that no matter the user or computer, must have as part of the mandatory configuration baseline. These are almost all security-relevant settings. Any settings that would deviate from this "universal truth" is broken into a separate user/computer policy and applied as/where needed. My goal at the end of the day is K.I.S.S. and to me this the easiest way to achieve that.

 I'm not that experienced with MPO-12 and am needing to buy some cables to connect at 100G. I wanted to check my understanding before i hit the order button. The transcievers are 100G-SR specification and needs OM4 duplex fibre according to cisco docs.
 To the questions... The trunk cable between the patch panels I've been told is 'crossover' which i assume is reverse type B therefore.
 My understanding is then the patch leads could be polarity A (straight through) or Polarity B (reversed).
 For devices that are DIRECTLY connecting in the cabinet (not through patch panel) they would need to use polarity B (reverse) however.
 Am i being stupid or misunderstanding this! I only know it's crossover trunk and it's male. The Polarity C is confusing me slightly in honesty!
 Any pointers at all would be helpful from someone with experience in this area - thank you in advanced.

 tldr; a security test that checks if a host is vulnerable to CVE-2023-34362 and attempts to execute techniques associated with Cl0p Ransomware Gang: https://www.preludesecurity.com/advisories/aa23-158a
 Longer Version
 I dropped in here a few weeks ago to better understand how CISA advisories flow through your organization.
 I'm back with something you can use. Basically, I'm curating (for now) CISA advisories and adding a security test (scale-ready TTP) to validate that you're devices, if relevant, are protected.
 The first publicly promoted one (there are others avail) is for #CL0p Ransomware + exploitation of MOVEit Vulnerability CVE-2023-34362.
 This tests whether a host is vulnerable to CVE-2023-34362 and attempts to execute techniques associated with Cl0p Ransomware Gang, which is actively exploiting this vulnerability. There is a .go source code file available if you decide you want to see whats running on the endpoint. 
 Note: this test utilizes basic port and version verification scanning to identify if an endpoint is vulnerable and does not modify the endpoint in any way. Command execution does not attempt to modify the system in any harmful way.
 Here are the actual steps of the test:
  
Get the external IP of the endpoint.
 Exit PROTECTED if unable to determine external IP and continue if not.
 Execute a version check for the applicable MOVEit Transfer version.
 Exit PROTECTED if applicable MOVEit Transfer version is not found and continue if not.
 Execute ingress tool transfer by dropping a pseudo malicious DLL containing Cl0p artifacts to disk.
 Execute a file write containing Cl0p-specific ransom note verbiage to disk.
 Exit PROTECTED if the test is stopped. UNPROTECTED if not.
  
Give it a shot. Let me know what you think: https://www.preludesecurity.com/advisories/aa23-158a

I investigated the logs, and there is no indication of anything out of the ordinary happening. I have metrics set up for it in the RMM tool, and it is running at 20% CPU and 15% RAM before shutting down. The thermals are within the normal range of 40-65.
 There have been no changes to the server since it began, and the updates have been running on the machines without difficulty for weeks.
 I'm attempting to figure out what's going on because the problem is on our main DC; this is a tiny office with only one employee.
 What I've been up to since acquiring access to the machine.
 - Removed the updates - Verified the GPOs
 - Removed unnecessary apps - Examined the internals (everything fine)
 - Verified that the Windows Server Key was activated.
 - Examined the hard drive (it was fine).
 - Dism and Sfc scans
 I am thinking of reinstalling the OS and seeing if that may help. It makes it a little more complex as this is their only DC and only available machine.
 Any suggestions to move forward with this?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all. So ive hit a bit of wall with this issue we have been having at our office which I could really use some guidance on. Our office is surrounded on most sides by another training provider who seems to think that any and every room they move into needs around 2/3 AP's. We are having issues where their AP's seem to do a channel scan every 30 minutes or so and change their channels around which causes all our AP's to hit 100% interference and connections drop off (We are using Unifi AP's and Controller). On a normal day 2.4Ghz is 100% taken over with their 4 SSID's overlapping themselves and the 5Ghz band is around 80% used up. We have tried to speak to them however they have said that it isn't their problem and suggested we just boost the signal of ours (we tried that for the sake of it but it just ended in more interference) or move all our devices over to 5Ghz which we currently have set to do if the device supports it. We have plenty of AP signal strength to cover the office for both 2.4 and 5Ghz.
 We've wired everyone we can in but the top dogs at the company come in and demand that their teams calls must not drop for even a second while on wifi. Have any of you guys had this kind of issue and how was it resolved/dealt with as me telling and showing them the graphs and stats seem to fall on deaf ears. To add to all this we have also had the students and staff from the other company complain to us because every 30 minutes they all lose connection (which when i suggested they might want to check that setting they ignored).

 We would like to automatically set an initial 16 digit startup PIN for users and then the users can change it to a shorter and easier PIN themselves since changing the existing PIN doesn’t need admin rights.

 For context I'm a new student in sys/network admin (1y) and currently in internship. I'm not really "new" in info, I did 2y in dev web/app and I'm truly passionate in info in general, and more specifically now in sys/network admin. I love to fully understand how the things I use works and you problably saw the problem coming, sys/network admin is an ocean and I think I'm drowning.
 One solution will be to just take time but I don't have much choice, I've to do a thesis for my school, and it have to be about a projet in my entreprise (RADIUS implementation + 802.1X). Big problem is, in my entreprise I don't really have a "mentor", honestly I don't need someone who know everything but just explain me what do we have in the entreprise and how things connect each other. All I have is a lot of doc scattered.
 Balance between learn the basics, search what I've in my entreprise and understand how it works is really diffucult. I don't want to complain about how life is difficult lmao, I've no choice but keep going however do you guys have advice to manage everything ? I don't think I'm there, but how to reconize when you're near to burn out ?
 Have a nice day

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TLDR: How does Windows identify known networks?
 ​
 I use Microsoft Always-On VPN, and it uses trusted network detection to determine if it's on or off-prem. Sounds good. It's supposed to use the DNS suffix issued by the DHCP to determine that. Except, it doesn't... It seems to actually use the "friendly name" of the network, and therein lies the problem.
 ​
 My internal dns suffix is ad.company.com. I also have wireless for corp-owned devices, which hands out the same suffix. So, random users' laptops may create new known networks with names like "Corp Wifi 2" or "ad.company.com 5" and can use them interchangeably regardless of whether the device is hardwired or on wireless. Since AOVPN seems to want to use the friendly names instead of the dns suffix like the MS docs say it uses, clients will randomly decide that they're off-prem and connect to the VPN server when they're on-prem breaking any access to internal resources. My temporary workaround has been to blackhole any connections to the VPN server from within the network, but that's causing other weird issues and delays in accessing network resources, though it ultimately does work.
 ​
 But you say, "just use GPO to create a network profile so the name doesn't change!" I'm sure you're absolutely correct, but when I'm creating the GPO, it appears to only let me select existing known networks on my computer, and it seems that I too have had those weird incremented network names in the past.
 ​
 Ultimately, my question is, how in the world is Windows fingerprinting the network, and why is it thinking the exact same network is a different one? Looking in the Computer\HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\NetworkList\Profiles\ registry hive where that info seems to live, I don't see anything like DNS suffixes, subnets, or anything other information that would be used to uniquely identify my corporate network.

 I understand that between the ISP modem and both Fortis, I must put a switch.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, as you all know many businesses use shared Android devices to provide their employees with access to corporate resources. However, managing these devices can be challenging, as they are often used by multiple people and may be exposed to a variety of security risks.
 Problem that businesses face:
 The following are some of the problems that businesses face when managing shared Android devices:
  
Security: Shared Android devices are at risk of being lost, stolen, or tampered with. This can lead to the unauthorized access of corporate data or the installation of malware.
 Compliance: Businesses must comply with a variety of regulations, such as data protection laws and industry standards. Managing shared Android devices can be difficult to do in a way that meets all of these compliance requirements.
 Cost: Managing shared Android devices can be expensive, as businesses need to purchase and maintain the devices, as well as the software and services needed to manage them.
  
Solution to their problem:
 There are a number of solutions that businesses can use to manage shared Android devices. These solutions include:
  
Mobile device management (MDM) software: MDM software can be used to remotely manage shared Android devices. This includes features such as remote wipe, password policies, and app management..
 Containerization: Containerization is a technique that can be used to isolate corporate data from personal data on shared Android devices. This helps to protect corporate data from unauthorized access.
 Bring your own device (BYOD): BYOD allows employees to use their own personal devices for work. This can help to reduce the cost of managing shared Android devices.

 I got a message this morning from one of our reps that an email from their client is being bounced back with the error "remote server returned 554 5.0.0 the account xxxxx@domain.com is disabled"
 The email this person is trying to contact on our end is a google group, which is receiving emails from others with no issue. It is also receiving email from others on that email chain without problem. 
 I used mxtoolbox to take a look at the sender domain, and nothing is blacklisted. The email is coming from a Microsoft exchange server from what I can tell. 
 There is no block of the domain in our Workspace admin console. 
 I did a bit of searching and found this post - https://forum.bestpractical.com/t/inbound-emails-bounce-for-a-specific-active-user/32256 
 But I do not believe the sender is sending from a google account in the first place, and their email account is clearly active. 
 The above linked post also points to this google article here, but as the sender does not appear to be using a google account, and our google group is not disabled and is actively sending emails, I am at a loss.
 Any idea how to proceed from here? I appreciate any and all advice!

 we use Cisco Meraki & NPS for WiFi Authentication (Device Certificate based).
 The device is a hybrid joined Windows device that obtains its certificate through intune. (on prem PKI,NDES Connector). For Fallback purposes we defined multiple RADIUS Servers (NPS Servers) on meraki.
 Here comes the problem:
 As long as the NPS Server resides inside in the same domain as the AD Computer object there is no problem with authentication, but if the NPS Server is located in different domain (Domain Trust established ofc) authentication fails with "NULL SID". We did have this setup working in the past (with an orphaned domain we wanted to get rid off)
 Any idea what can cause that problem?

I asked my manager and he said to research it because he would like to make a vm that everyone in our network team could log in with when they want to do a lab. After googling I found out the VIRL is now CML. We are a university 
 They have different versions of CML and I have questions because I don't know how to interpret their site perfectly. This is the website I'm reading from: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/cloud-systems-management/modeling-labs/index.html#~licensing 
 Personal - Single use only. Does this mean only 1 person can be logged in at once and others must wait until they are done, or does it mean only 1 person can be logged in and it always the same person logging in?
 Enterprise:
 - Multi user - Maybe this is what I really need.
 - What does TAC support mean? Will I be able to call someone and they can help me if I get stuck in a lab? I doubt it. Maybe it means they support in the setting up of the VM and installing the software?
 Higher Education:
 - I work at a university. Would this mean I can use this type of CML? Why would I choose this over enterprise? The site says it licenses for concurrent users instead of nodes. This makes me think enterprise works like this: you have license for 20 nodes. User 1 logs in and uses 5 nodes. User 2 logs in and uses 15 nodes. User 3 logs in and has no nodes to use until the other 2 users shut their labs down.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all, I have a question that I am trying to troubleshoot with users and I am really struggling so I thought I would reach out to see if anyone has seen similar.
 When a user who uses Windows 11 tries to RDP to a server there is a delay between clicking 'Connect' and the password prompt appearing. This delay is about 5 minutes from our testing but once it has happened and the password box appears then all is fine from then on, no other slowdowns at all. This happens to servers both on the same site and remotely.
 While the delay is happening, there is a screen in the background that you cannot interact with or click to have appear, only if you hover over it from the taskbar do you see it. A screenshot of which is linked here: https://imgur.com/a/9XDdwDH.
 If we delete the cache for RDP (as noted here: https://www.tachytelic.net/2019/01/clear-rdp-cache/) then it works once as normal but the delay occurs again on subsequent connections until the cache is cleared again. I can't see anything in the cache that would cause a delay like this, its only impacting Windows 11 machines and it only started this week.
 Has anyone seen anything like this before?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have a series of background tasks written in Python such as checking for today's date, monitoring my inbox for specific emails, triggering some reminders etc.
 At the moment, I have managed to schedule those tasks to start at a specific date and time, or at specific events using the windows task scheduler (WTS). However, I have come up with several issues:
 1. For some of these tasks, like the inbox monitoring script, I need them to run continuously in the background, and for some of them I need specific time scheduling (run between this and this date)
 2. 1. For some of these tasks, I need to implement some stopping clauses (ie. events that terminate these tasks external to the list of events provided by WTS). An example of such, is when some specific file was saving into a folder (the background tasks keeps checking the existence of that folder continuously/periodically) or when an environment variable is modified following another user manipulation.
 3. It is easy for the user to shut the task by mistake, and I have little to no traceability of these tasks in WTS
 My question is: Do I need to consider a virtual machine or setting up a container (using Windows containers or Docker) to achieve a better orchestration of these tasks? The goal is to have a clearer overview of all the tasks that are running, their state (terminated, failed or running) as well as ensure that I can implement some stopping clauses for these tasks.
 Any help would be much appreciated. Thank you.

 I wanted to ask how others do it. I am an IT admin in a it-system house for various customers and for the IT-system house itself. During my day the following work comes up: • new orders from customers - install hardware and replace it with existing one, software installations and setups - come via email from our ERP system • incidents and less time-consuming changes in the existing system - come in via our ticket system • Projects, some of which last one or more weeks, sometimes involving several colleagues from other departments Fixed appointments, which are entered in the Outlook calendar My problem is that there are so many things, and there is a mess in my head the whole workday. I look in the Outlook calendar, in the ticket system, in OneNote in my to-do list and, as I said before, I always have this feeling that I might forget something. How do you do that to get an order in your tasks?

 We have different vlans for prod and dev but i can't think of way to enforce that the vm is only allowed into dev vlan as the employeen could just change the interface in virtualbox, hyper-v etc. 
 The end result should be that employee device and the vm's should be in different vlans. Maybe someone here went through something similiar like this and has some input?

 ​
 I am currently struggling with implementing Intune for our devices. Long story short its related to blocking USB Devices, BUT allow certain ones.
 ​
 We are running a hybrid AD to make things even more fun. Company has never used Intune further than to test it for Mobile devices, but now wants to use it just for the USB issue. We are also running a inventory program that is doing all the heavy lifting, which should stay that way. Does Intune screw with inventory programs?
 I have looked on a few microsoft resources already, but non have been able to solve the issue.
 ​
 I did try to join a device via corperate portal but since the device is already AD joined it wont let me past the domain join page. Besides that I did also try autoenrollment, but that was also unfruitful.
 ​
 Any ideas?

 I'm facing an issue I can't find anything about by googling but as a long time lurker in this forum I'm sure someone here can help me ;-)
 ​
 I'm installing clients with Opsi via PXE-boot. After the installation of Windows 11 I can enable bitlocker with PIN but it's not the familiar blue screen. It's like bitlocker is in some legacy mode: https://imgur.com/a/EmNk5Ht
 I can install Windows 10 just fine the same way and bitlocker looks normal.
 So far I've tried to install the os manually from the same image (normal bitlocker), installing the os via opsi without any follow up packages (legacy bitlocker), creating a new winpe for Windows 11 (legacy bitlocker) and different settings in BIOS (legacy bitlocker).
 Thanks in advance.

We already have a normal server with Proxmox as the OS, while this new server would be configured with Windows Server 2022, since we don't need to create VMs on it and installing Nvidia drivers on Windows is less of an headache.
 Is there any platform we can use to manage both servers at the same time, without having different panels for each of them? I've already considered installing Proxmox on the second server and creating a cluster with both of them, but it would be necessary to configure PCI passthrough for the GPU to work with the VMs, and as for all I've read it is not really stable, so I would really like to avoid it, if there are any other ways. 
 Thanks! And sorry if I did any mistakes, it's one of my first posts on Reddit.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Some things to keep in mind when it comes to secrets management:
 - Secrets management is a major challenge for organizations and can lead to leaks and breaches.
 - Stolen credentials are frequently used to gain access to an organization's systems.
 - Revoking credentials is more important than rotating them in the event of a leak.
 - A well-oiled credential management system should have closed loops to maintain a desired state.
 - Detective controls and logging are important for detecting credential usage and leaks.
 - Expiry times for credentials should be carefully considered to balance security and practicality.
 - Store credentials only where they are needed to avoid single points of failure.
 - Secure enclaves provide the highest level of security for storing credentials.
 - Utilize reliable authentication mechanisms rather than implementing your own.
 - Regularly check for weak secrets by comparing hashes.

 Let's say that I had a laptop get stolen, and it was enrolled into Autopilot. So as I understand it; if the machine gets wiped in any capacity, it will contact MS and do it's configuration again.
 But what would happen if someone unauthorized tries loads a version of Windows Home on the machine? Would it still "enroll" into Autopilot and prevent the device from being used?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings folks.
 The HR department at my current place of employ is pushing us to deploy a product called "Indie" by a Pioneera
 This thing is basically an AI plugin to teams which listens to everything (calls. Chats. Channels. Mentions. Everything), and "nudges" you to be more production/healthier/various other things - all things HR wants to push.
 The trouble is, it has some requirements which wave massive red flags at me from a security perspective - quite ignoring the "listens to everything" aspect, which is way, way too big brother for my liking.
 Some include
  
Uses OATH to access Azure for AD mappings, and wants access to everything - the entire AD detail of every user in Azure - names, phones, group memberships o- you name it.
 ridiculously high security permissions in Microsoft365 - including, but not limited to, reading the user profile, reading and writing all chat messages, reading all mail in all mailboxes the user has access to, and other levels which simply boggle my mind.
 No indication of where data is stored (we are a multinational company with staff all over the world, including in GDPR covered locations)
 Infinite time data storage unless specifically instructed by the company to delete it
  
There's a lot more issues jumping out, but those are the biggies.
 So - has anyone here actually implemented this thing anywhere? Have any experiences - good or bad - from a security/administration perspective to relate? I can't find any genuine reviews online from any source I actually trust to be objective - I'll take anything anyone knows onboard.
 I realise this may be a little obtuse for anyone here to have actually come across it, and if it gets me nothing, at least I tried.
 Thanks

 I'm facing a challenge and I'm hoping to get some help from this community. 
 This one is pretty basic, so I’ll lay it out there. 
 We have an offshore team member who urgently needs VPN access with Remote Desktop to sign in from their laptop to a machine hosted in the United States. It's crucial for them to work with EMRs and maintain secure access for auditing data.
 Currently, I'm stuck because the RDP is configured by Microsoft for in-network access only. Therefore, I'm looking for a VPN solution that I can quickly download and configure to enable immediate access for our team member. I apologize for the broad question, as I'm currently on my way home and seeking a timely solution. 
 It's worth noting that we have a Watchguard Firebox firewall with VPN capabilities, but I'm hoping to provide access as quickly as possible. Any assistance would be greatly appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey Reddit community,
 I'm facing an issue with IP address translation using NAT, and I could really use some assistance. Here's the situation:
 I have a packet coming from a client within my subnet (let's call it Subnet A), but it's intended for a server with a public IP address outside Subnet A. I want to translate the destination address of the packet, so that my router directs it to a private IP address within Subnet A instead.
 I've been trying to figure out how to accomplish this, but I'm not quite sure which NAT feature or configuration would be suitable for my case. I've explored options like "Virtual Server" and "Port Forwarding," but they seem to be geared towards incoming packets from outside the subnet.
 I've read about Destination NAT but I checked the 5 different routers I have available at the office and none of them support DNAT. I've seen on the internet that some people use routers that work with line commands instead of an HMI interface, but I also don't have one of those.
 Can anyone guide me on how to achieve this translation within my network? Are there any specific NAT settings or techniques I should be looking into? Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!
 Thanks in advance!

 Am I right in thinking the best solution to get each site communicating with one another is to connect fibre directly to firewalls, give the interfaces an IP and then create a static route on either side? Both sites have their own single /24 lan.
 Then I will add a firewall policy allowing specified traffic over the route.
 I feel like I've been overthinking this and I'm also not fully familiar with watchguards just yet but will be working with them a lot over the coming months.

 I maybe thought Fibre Ethernet but EFM by design is a copper service.
 Edit: It seems like the First Mile is actually just referring to the entire length of the connection between you and the exchange. And Ethernet is jsut referring to copper over Ethernet. Right?

 ​
 Helping a friend out who is renovating a music venue. It is a 3000 capacity venue, somewhat of an open ballroom style space - I’m helping delegate where cameras, AP’s, etc are going to go as this was overlooked previously. Edit - I am not necessarily doing anything end to end on this project, just trying to help a group who is trying to delegate to contractors. 
 Is ubiquiti sufficient to just use across the board for this kind of thing? Every phone won’t be on the network as far as I know unless they opt for a public network, so likely an artist and staff network. 
 Any suggestions as to what to use for ap's and or just some back end tips and advice to help me talk and walk through some things to help figure out cable pulls?

 Trying to get my head around how SSO works with NetSuite. Once setup I was expecting to be redirected to my IDP for authentication and then given access to the roles within NS however I'm still logging in via NS and then selecting the role with no interaction with Azure. 
 ​
 I've created the SSO role as per documentation and test from azure is successful however we have many roles for different aspects of NS. When I've setup for other applications in the past its been more of a blanket SSO if that makes sense. 
 Appreciate any help and apologies if I'm not clear in my post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi all,
 Been having an issue with this for awhile now, and just wondering what the general accepted procedure would be.
 Our setup: Multiple O365 tenants using Veeam for Office 365 backup Onprem AD sync to Azure AD/O365 
 When a user leaves, I believe the other techs are manually removing their account in O365 and disabling their AD account, however we then get a large list of warnings on our Veeam job report that it can no longer find the users. The way I've been dealing with that is manually excluding those users from further backups.
 I know this is not a good practice, just not too sure of what would be considered good practice? Our Veeam provider has suggested we create essentially an 'All Users' group and only backup that group, however that relies on multiple people actually adding new users to this group at creation. 
 Any help/suggestions would be amazing

 I´m in academic Institution and so far we are striving to get lost of as many as possible standardPoolPCs. I guess the times changed , and we were a classic computer pool for long time..
 For like 20 years we bought like everytime Dell Optiplex SFF (SmallFormfactor) with midrange Dell Monitors. We buy stuff on like 5 year rollation every half oft , so this year we gonna find a followup configuration to really 10 year old PCs (Optiplex 3020 , sff, Celeron, 4gb RAM , 400 GBHDD)
 So far we are like to about buy a Optiplex 3050 ssf, I3-12100 as standard with 8GB and 256 nvme, which is enough. Monitorwise a 24 Inch Dell is intented.
 But since Corona the students put money in their equipment and so there are many more laptops which have thunderbolt or USB-C PD
 so we are planning to buy decent and good monitors/screens with integrated KVM / LAN (LAN is important because in the rooms there is no sufficient WIFI, we will use eduroam 802.1X for connections)
 recently i tried those Configurations* Dell P2723QE mit USB-C Hub (fi this review : https://www.pcworld.com/article/630195/630195.html)* Fujitsu Fujitsu P2711 TS QHD mit USB-C (https://www.fujitsu.com/de/products/computing/peripheral/displays/p2711-ts-qhd/)
 with both USB-C PD (Powerdelievery works fine)with both Screen is connected properly
 ... we tried like 5 Devices on it, just to get a feelingt..
 no Problems so far, unless sometimes there seems to be some freezes in LAN , one Windows 11 Device connected to usb-C also lost totally the LAN connection. Strange but it seems like Realtek Network 8153 related Problems which occur sometimes on specific situations.
 ​
 Questions to you:
 Do you guys have any suggestions on good other KVM Integrated Screens? Which is your favorite?
 Do you guys have other Ideas towards my plan. First I tended to buy USB-C Docks, but now I think integrated is way better!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hello, 
 In our current situation we have a large portion of our infrastructure being managed by the IT department of our parent company. Everything down to the ESXI hosts are their responsibility, while the virtual servers of our factories are our own responsibility. This works reasonably well, although I wouldn't mind having my own team doing the managing like I am used to at other jobs (lets just say we have had our issues with the IT department, like them running WEP SSID's till end 2022). 
 Anyway, when we run a project we request a new virtual server, they deploy one via a template and we get on our way. We use their KMS server to activate our Windows products and occasionally when there is Office on the server installed to activate that too. 
 Now we run into the situation that we are most likely being sold. The IT manager of our parent company informed us today that they do not want to assist with creating new servers (requested 10 more) because when moving to the new owner they expect us to create new servers with them and moving the application and data over, and not move the virtual servers itself. 
 The servers run in our own domain separate from the parent company, meaning they have no cached administrative credentials or anything like that saved on our VMs that could potentially leak. Their reasoning for migrating applications + data rather than the VM itself is because of Windows licensing. But from my limited experience with KMS a Windows server will contact the KMS to renew their activation every X months. Surely we could simply release the current licenses being assigned to our servers via KMS, switch over to the KMS of the new owner and bobs your uncle? 
 Or does KMS licensing work differently? 
 Any insight would be appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Synopsis: I have 2 VPCs with different CIDRS, each with a public and private subnet. There is an Ubuntu in each public subnet with an WG setup, which connects the two VPCs.
 Goal: My goal is to be able to connect to a machine in the private subnet of one of the VPCs from a machine in the private subnet of the other VPC over the WG connection, without setting up additional WG instances on the machines in the privates subnets. 
 Detailed Setup:
 1. VPC_cloud:
 - CIDR: 172.16.0.0/21 - public_subnet CIDR: 172.16.0.0/24 - private_subnet CIDR: 172.16.1.0/24 - WG ip address: 192.168.0.1/24
  
VPC_edge:
 CIDR: 10.0.0.0/24
 public_subnet CIDR: 10.0.0.0/26
 private_subnet CIDR: 10.0.0.64/26
 WG ip address: 192.168.0.2/24
  
In my current setup I am able to ping 192.168.0.1 from the WG Machine in VPC_edge and vice versa. I'm also able to ping the none WG ip of the WG machine in VPC_cloud from the WG machine in VPC_edge and vice versa. Like:ubuntu@10.0.0.10 ping 172.16.0.4 (and vice versa) works. But any other instance (except for the WG instance itself) on the same VPC can't be reached. IP forwarding is also enabled on both machines, BTW.
 As I understand the problem is with my routing, since WG setup works as expected, but I'm not sure what do do. Any help/advise is appreciated. Thanks! BTW, this is no homelab. It's a PoC that will be used in production. I'm sorry if this isn't the right place to ask.

 We want to set up a KMS Server for offline activation (are completely disconnected from the Internet and partially not in the domain) of Windows 10/11 Client as well as for Windows Server 2019+2022. 
 But how do we get the KMS host key now? We can't find it in M365 portal. I have read that the old Volume Licensing Center is no longer supported. I can only see the different Keys for example Windows server 2019 0/120 available in the M365 Portal.
 Is this still a viable way with KMS? Can someone help me? Thanks a lot.

 Azure - Networking - West Europe - Investigating
 Starting at 07:22 UTC on 05 Jul 2023, a subset of Azure customers in West Europe may experience packet drops, timeouts and increased latencies in responses. We determined a number of fiber links between datacenters have become unavailable due to a fiber cut. Automated systems are balancing load and rerouting traffic, but customers may still experience degradation.
 Current Status: Our investigations are showing that service-to-customer communications over Internet/Express route are not experiencing impact currently, with impact predominantly to internal service-to-service communications from one datacenter to another datacenter in the West Europe region.
 We continue exploring multiple mitigation options. The next update will be provided in 60 minutes, or as events warrant.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All, 
 This is driving my around the twist, so thanks for any help. 
 I have a specific scenario that would normally be prevented but has been allowed through under special request from the higher ups. 
 The context is this - 
 A user wishes to connect via the standard RDP client from a off domain device to their work laptop. This would not normally be allowed, but hey ho. 
 The mitigation i am putting in place are these : 
 Firewall rule to only allow a connection from the static local IP of his device on the RDP port
 Preventing drive mapping.
 Preventing Clipboard. 
 To achieve this it appears a local group policy can be created. This policy then changes the following keys: 
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server - DisableDriveRedirection = 1
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services - fDisableCdm =1
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Terminal Server - DisableClipboardRedirection = 1
 HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows NT\Terminal Services - fDisableClip = 1 
 I have enabled all of these however I'm still able to connect with local drives mounted from the off domain device to the on domain device, aswell as access the data on them. 
 The goal is to prevent file transfer and copy + paste. 
 I may be missing something really obvious. I'm deploying the reg keys via intune, I'm aiming to avoid local GP so that if the user changes device or moves to a new one the settings are deployed down. 
 Thanks all in advice, Sorry if this is a really obvious solution, It may be a case of getting in too deep and not being able to see the trees from the woods.

 This means that part of the barcode is not printed and it is not scannable by the courier. We temporarily have to print all labels on normal paper and secure them with tape.
 We suspect that the printing head may be failing, but the replacement part is very expensive. Do you know what may be causing this issue a part from a failing printing head?

 Probably a simple query but not something I have come across before.

 There has always been a main/default domain to which users are set when created, however last week a handful of users has their default domain changed, seemingly randomly.
 Some users received a pop-up in outlook asking to restart as the exchange admin has made a change.
 Is there a best way to check why this happened?
 I was looking through the audit page however non of the parameters seemed correct in this scenario.
 Cheers, all!

 So my question is, can I connect one monitor to the PC via HDMI and then run a DP cable from 1st to 2nd monitor? The PC is located a bit far away so i can't test it right now, that's why i ask here..
 Or does anyone have another idea why the 2nd monitor gets detected but won't display anything?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 I’ve been tasked with conducting a research into the possibilities to configure Azure Active Directory programmatically and monitor for configuration drift afterwards. The first seems to be covered by the Graph API, well at least for a large part, but I can’t find any information about monitoring configuration drift for Azure AD. I had hoped that Azure policy could be used for that, but apparently AAD seems to be out-of-scope for Azure Policy. 
 Does anyone have some information or pointers I can use to cover these questions.
 Thanks!

 If I apply this patch, my 2 DCs have broken KDC service. I think it's the evolution of Netlogon that does it but I can't seem to fix it.
 The registry key "KrbtgtFullPacSignature" is 2 and I can't change it to 0 because I have to upgrade a NetApp NAS.
 If anyone has a lead, I take it.
 Thx

 This morning when I arrived at the office, I couldn't do anything. I started troubleshoot the problem, trying to see if one of our links to the outside had fallen, but no, it wasn't there.
 After a few nslookup and other command, started to see some failure.
 The problem ? Our head office had migrated it's DNS servers to AWS and apparently had forgotten to move one or more VMs (Or other things).
 The result ? All the company's national MPLS had no connection to the internal service and beyond.
 Have a coffee everyone, today is going to be a long journey.

Strange thing is occurring though - on first login (before FSLogix VHD creation) the user's fine, start menu functions as you'd expect. Log off and back on, Start menu opens, but completely devoid of any tiles, applications, or anything - aside from 'Settings' & 'Windows Security'.
 Killing the explorer.exe process as the user, then respawning it brings everything back to as it should be. Can't see anything in the FSLogix logs pointing to this.
 The stranger thing is, the exact same policies on our Citrix shared desktop OU works perfectly fine.
 In both cases (RDS farm & Citrix shared desktops) we're running server 2022.
 Anyone have any ideas?

 Having a bit of trouble with printer sharing on around 15 of our desktops running Win10.
 They have specialist USB thermal printers plugged into them and all working fine as local printers. However I need to be able to print to those from other desktops. I have shared the printers from each PC but something is still stopping them from being visible to the network. Are there any other places in Windows 10 that printer or network visibility could be turned off other than Control Panel -> Network and Sharing -> Advanced Sharing Settings ?
 Many Thanks!!!!

We've put an exception on the transport rule so if the recipient is gmail.com then to route outside of the connector as outside of organization.

 Our email filtering provider is aware and are working towards this but we don't want to drop the send connector entirely as we then lose tracking of our outbound messages in the portal they provide us with.

We would only be doing 500-1000 seals a year. I have approached two certificate companies and I have been quoted £5000 to set up a certificate and I think this is a lot of money, and I'm not sure if the certificate companies understand the requirements.
 I'm just wondering if anyone has set up a seal and how they set up the the certificate etc. Any help appreciated

 I'm trying to implement LAPS, following the steps in this website
 When I try to set the Set-AdmPwdResetPasswordPermission, I'm getting a:
  
Set-AdmPwdResetPasswordPermission : No such object foundAt line:1 char:1+ Set-AdmPwdResetPasswordPermission -OrgUnit "Laptops" -AllowedPrincipa ...+ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~+ CategoryInfo : NotSpecified: (:) [Set-AdmPwdResetPasswordPermission], DirectoryOperationException+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : System.DirectoryServices.Protocols.DirectoryOperationException,AdmPwd.PS.DelegateResetPasswordPermission
  
I did some searching and it looks like the OU, or the security group cannot be found.
 To make sure that I'm using an OU and a security group that actually do exist, I created a little script:
 $ouName = "Laptops" $ou = Get-ADOrganizationalUnit -Filter {Name -eq $ouName} $ouDN = $ou.DistinguishedName $ouDN $groupName = "*supportdesk*" $group = Get-ADGroup -Filter {Name -like $groupName} -Properties CN $groupCN = $group.CN $groupCN #Set permissions with Set-AdmPwdResetPasswordPermission Set-AdmPwdResetPasswordPermission -OrgUnit $ouDN -AllowedPrincipals $groupCN 
 The output of the variables is as expected, but I'm still getting the error
 What could this be?

I looked, and there are no errors, and the system says it printed fine. User complains that nothing showed up. They confirmed the IP of the printer, and said it was printing other stuff fine. First thing I do is ping it. No response. Then I find out they shut all the equipment down at night, including all the printers. Ok, I can’t diagnose what I can’t connect to. They leave the printer up, and I take the time to send a printout and trace it through the output server and watch it route to China with no error. The next day they say there is no output.
 I logged into the HP print server page, and there is nothing showing an error, except the toner is at 5%. I type up a ‘hello world’ in notepad, hook up my window desktop to it, and print. No errors. I follow it immediately with another server print.
 Just heard from them that nothing showed up. Neither document. At this point, I’m going all Det. Murtaugh and saying “I’m too old for this shit.” Dumping it back on the support team. If windows won’t print to it, let desktop support take it. I’ m out. Let them prove to me the printer they are looking at is the one they told me. There’s probably a pile of output sitting on someone’s printer 3 buildings over.

We received quote directly from Citrix through the portal. The var we use contacted the Citrix rep and passed down a quote to us around 8k more than direct quote from Citrix. After weeks of back and forth, the citrix rep gave a cryptic answer and ghosted both the var and us. I went ahead and process through the portal with PO#. Citrix sent renewal confirmation with renewed certificates and keys that expire 2024. Invoice is now sent as well. Just for anyone that may run into this, challenge it and see if you can keep costs down. What a sketchy company this has turned into. The end is near I am afraid administering Citrix for over 20 years now.

 What is the industry standard/common approach for hosting web applications? Is there a best approach? Or is it dependent on use case? What would be the use cast for each approach?
 Similar with web applications, what is a better approach with databases? Having multiple docker containers for hosting databases for redundancy or deploying database replication (MySQL master-slave replication)?

 For example, say I want to use some automation to push a config update with netmiko to 10 devices. I could use my individual credentials to runn that and connect to the devices. However, what if I want to run some other automation like grabbing config backups or collecting the status of various network devices at regular intervals?
 There comes this debate of always using individual credentials vs having a non-user/master account. A master account can be very useful, but I get the feeling some people get turned off by this and view it as a security risk.
 How do you navigate this in your automation? Is every bit if automation run individually by each employee, or do you have non-user specific accounts that are used to connect and authenticate to things? (If the later, how is security handled)

 I want the employees to log in with user and psw using a simple webpage and then, if ok, start using the network.
 If I understand well, to implement all of this you can use Captive Portal authentication (that includes WAPs and a WLC with a RADIUS server for authentication).I searched for WAPs/WLCs and read some manual but can’t decide what to use. I don't have Active Directory. Can you please suggest me:
  
some WAP/WLC that is all-in-one with a RADIUS server and is good, affordable in your experience;
 or some good, trusted, affordable WAP that can use RADIUS installed on a PC, that is not too complicated to configure (in this case the server is acting as WLC I think)?Thank you very much and sry for the confusion.

 Remoted in and TrueNAS server is down. This is critical to their operations and gets the highest priority. Customer said “When I press the power button, the server doesn’t turn on like everything else”
 I built this server personally using a Dell Poweredge R710, Perc H310 in HBA mode. 
 Fortunately I have spares, I took the staging server were were going to use to deploy an exchange upgrade and brought it with me.
 Went on-site, the power supply LED’s were on, pressed the power button and, nothing, pressed the blue light indicator and nothing, must be a bad motherboard. Since it would be much easier and faster to move the HBA and hard drives to the other server then it would be to replace the motherboard, that’s what I did.
 I didn’t move the processors or the RAM. The replacement server has 32GB of RAM and faster processors, so that’s fine (more than overkill) for a NAS.
 After the swap I reconfigured the BIOS, and the server came right up, added the Static IP and bingo, everything is back online, total time from initial call to completed server replacement 3 hours. 
 I’m feeling pretty great right now. Customer was off today, the end users won’t even know what happened.
 This is how smooth a “disaster” should be. When you’re prepared, even a server failure is piece of cake.
 Now it’s only 1:00 PM and I can enjoy the rest of the holiday.

 For 5061- Tenant 1:
 When making a call from teams the Teams SIP proxy with souce FQDN sip.pstnhub.microsoft.com sends an INVITE packet to the SBC and advertises the IP it wants you to connect voice data on. The SBC does it's magic with the local PSTN trunk and eventually replies with a 183 Session progress packet to the Microsoft SIP proxy telling it to send voice packets to the public IP:Port 88.88.88.88:5061. Microsft acknowledges this and then sends another invite packet to start the call. The call works

So far, for just a modem/media converter-type device, I've only been finding devices with USB ports, but I need an ethernet port. Ideally, it would be 5G compatible, but I don't need mmwave since this is for a more rural site. That said, I won't turn down mmwave-compatible devices.
 Normally, for a small/mobile site, I'd grab a Cradlepoint or maybe a Pepwave and be done, but I need to integrate with an existing firewall that only has ethernet wan interfaces. I'm hoping for the existing firewall to get the public IP from the cellular network so I don't have to worry about extra routing or double-NATting. Any suggestions?

 As it stands today we're a pretty heady mix of 30% wireless and 70% wired spread across 10 locations and 400 users. As of today all laptop docks have a CAT5 to them and everything else is wireless.
 Is there any good reason why we shouldn't go 100% wireless if it is designed properly?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Happy 4th, folks. I'm trying to get a single Palo Alto VM Series running in Azure, and I know Palo's pretty well but my Azure skills come and go as I don't use it all the time so I'm trying to get past the cloud specific nuances to be able to hit the mgmt IP via HTTPS and get to the normal firewall config stuff. I do understand azure basics like VNET's related to Subnet's which associate to Route tables and how UDR's are needed often times or inter-vnet connections, etc.
 My main issue is when I went to deploy the NGFW this time in Azure, I only have public subnet, Private subnet, and public IP. I remember and see in older documentation there was a management subnet to configure as well but I don't see that currently when configuring one.
 So my question is.... given the context that I just want to get a basic Palo up and running and reach it via mgmt.... not even worried about the nat stuff or data plane route tables and whatnot in azure yet..... what is the easiest method to do this? I can't seem to find a good guide or video on it... and I know it shouldn't be a process that technically needs one anyway, simple concept but I'm just not sure what to do next. Any help is appreciated and will be gifted with all the upvotes I have to gift. No gold because I'm mad about the API changes killing my RIF app though.
 ​
 Edit: and for the record if the public IP is what I'm supposed to be hitting, no dice currently, and there's no NSG associated with it.... if that public IP is the answer..... maybe I need to figure out how it relates to a route table and make a 0.0.0.0/0 to internet or something. but anyway, point still stands... I M Noob today.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[One of our buildings on campus is going to be part of an arts event with projections going onto the building, synchronised with music coming from speaker stacks etc.
 This is a longstanding event happening every couple of years, but new this year, is a live element, rather than everything being pre-recorded, so they need an internet connection delivering to their (temporary) control location.
 Logically, I think we're sorted, chuck them in the guest VRF, new VLAN, and some basic firewall rules, but physically it's going to be an area we don't have much experience in, and I'm looking for any advice from anyone who's done similar?
 It's temporary, so any changes to building fabric are ruled out (e.g. nobody's going to be getting Estates dept. out with a drill.)
 Their kit doesn't support WiFi, but would do 4/5G. We're ruling that out due to signal strength being poor in the location at the best of times, and once you add in a significant audience, we wouldn't want to rely on it.
 They're approx. 50m from a nearby building, so we're probably within spec to just run a long piece of Cat6A through the window from an existing data point, but this cable will need to share containment with mains power (240V/50Hz), and so I think there may be both technical and regulatory issues with this? I don't want this to fail an electrical inspection just before the event and lead us to have to frantically replan.
 My two main thoughts are fibre from an existing switch in a ground floor room, or P2P Wireless, with a preference for fibre (for cost reasons as we'll always re-use SFP modules and switches, but P2P kit is less likely to find any future use for us.)
 Has anyone done anything similar?
 If fibre is the answer, what level of armouring/ruggedising is necessary? This will be in a publicly accessible area with kids running around etc.
 Event isn't until much later in the year, but I'd rather have everything planned, purchased and tested well ahead of time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL/DR - what do you think people without tech/IT/etc knowledge think you do for work?
 As the 4th of July holiday in the US brings people and families together I always run into the “so what do you actually do” type questions but I never feel people really get it even from a high level. 
 My basic spiel as a network engineer is “when you use the internet your phone is connecting to something like Netflix for instance, Netflix uses tons of servers so everyone can watch at the same time, these servers are in data centers which are huge buildings filled with servers. These servers need to connect to the internet so you can use them, I make sure these connections all work fast and for 1000s of devices”
 Really the launching point of this question is someone in my family equated data center with warehouse which made them think I was basically moving around boxes. This prompted them to ask if I was a manager or warehouse manager and when I said no they said that our other relative could put a good word in at the candy factory they work at that I should consider it. 
 I understand not knowing the ins and outs of a job because most people don’t know that for most jobs but to not even have a high level concept of it was a bit mind boggling especially since they equated it to something very random. 
 So how does everyone else explain what they do to non-tech/IT/etc folks and more importantly do people actually understand at all?

 I'm aware of the above security features on access switches; however, if I spoof my mac-address and use the matching IP on the ARP table, I cannot see how these features can prevent any attack since they only look to the mac-address and IP.

 Am I wrong? Please comment.

 I have a few customers in a rural location that are experiencing issues with downstream errors and lost syncs but I can't figure out why. Each node is an 8x4 DOCSIS 3.0 setup.
 One customer in particular reports issues with lag spikes and disconnects throughout the day. I did some troubleshooting, their modem is receiving about -2dB on the DS and TX is about +35dB. Return SNR on the node is ~30dB. I did a constellation on each of the DS channels from the customer modem and I didn't see any obvious issues. No blurring or DC offset etc. The modem itself is consistently reporting ~ 0.05% error rate across all of the downstream channels, and has logged a bunch of timeouts and lost syncs over the past few days. 
 My techs did a sweep of the area and didn't find any obvious issues. No damaged lines, taps, etc. This customer's tap and drop are brand new. No splits or any other devices in the home, just the cable modem. We've finally had some steady temperatures over the past few weeks so levels have been well within the AGC window overnight. 
 Any ideas? My next step is to try a different cable port or line card on my CMTS, but not everyone on that node is having the same issue.

 If we assume that Bitlocker itself has no vulnerabilities and is properly implemented, I don't see any way to crack it, assuming a secure password was used, which to my knowledge is not the case with the TPM. The way I see it, the TPM gives an additional attack vector, since the keys are stored in the TPM and someone might find a way to extract them.
 I would very much like to hear your opinion on this.

 I noticed that there is no dedicated Barracuda subreddit to post this in, but there seems a to be an aweful lot of people having experiences with this glorified linux boxes.
 I come from a Fortinet background, but have used Barracuda to prepare for my exams in previous years. Currently i have the task to take a json file from the interweb, extract a certain portion of ip addresses and get them into one of Barracuda's 4 CustomExternalObjects.
 Technicalities:
  
Hardware: Barracuda F82 Annex-B Revision A
 Firmware: 9.0.0-0511
 License status: Unlicensed, DEMO mode
  
Achievements so far:
  
Writing a python3 script that downloads a json file with ip addresses from the web (script can be provided if someone finds it useful)
 Parsing the json and getting rid of duplicates
 Writing the final IP list to a file with one CIDR entry in each line
  
Where i fail:
  
Using /var/phion/bin/CustomExternalAddrImport to import those CIDR IPs into the CustomExternalObject
 The command runs without errors (no message in linux is usually a good message)
 The address file disappears, but the Firewall Admin shows me an empty list
  
Questions:
  
Has anyone done this successfully on a newer firmware build?
 Are there any logs i could plow through? A quick check showed me no signs of command execution logging.
  
Thank you in advance

 Our ISP currently emails their bills to me as It was my email that was used during the application, because of that it falls under me to print and forward the billing statements in-person to the accounting team.
 My email is the admin email of their Google Workspace (on the way to migrating to Office 365 in about a few months), I'm currently thinking of a way to make my life easier by having the billing statements just pop into the accounting team's inboxes instead of relying on me to hand it to them (also means I don't have to worry about giving it late due to being busy).
 I'm kinda back and forthing with how I'm suppose to be approaching this. I would assume that the ISP (or any company that offers subscription based billing) would only take in 1 email as their main point of contact for the company. So I'm having a hard time figuring out a way to delegate those billing emails through distribution lists or shared mailboxes.
 I would like to be enlightened on how stuff like these usually goes for other companies. I get that my email was used because I am the SysAd and will be the ISP's point of contact but I'm pretty sure the billing shouldn't be put into my inboxes no?
 In addition how should emails be setup if there would be another SysAd personnel added, how would that work out?

 Probably a simple query but not something I have come across before.
 We operate one of our tenants on Microsoft 365, in which we have 3 domains.
 There has always been a main/default domain to which users are set when created, however last week a handful of users has their default domain changed, seemingly randomly.
 Some users received a pop-up in outlook asking to restart as the exchange admin has made a change.
 Is there a best way to check why this happened?
 I was looking through the audit page however non of the parameters seemed correct in this scenario.
 Cheers, all!

In this case, the WLC is located locally, but since it resides on one of the APs, I'm wondering if utilizing the FlexConnect mode will result in greater throughput compared to running the APs in Local mode. In Local mode, the connection to the Embedded WLC-AP becomes the bottleneck, is that correct?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are beginning to slowly roll out Windows 11 to users, and I mean slowly. Basically, we have only a few IT staff, myself included, that have them. The IT staff all have secondary admin accounts that have admin access to their laptops, these are also active directory accounts. 
 Now for the issue, we all WFH at least three days a week which is great. However, there seems to be an issue with Windows 11 caching the credentials for our standard accounts. Let's say I work from the office on Monday, on Tuesday morning I can turn on my laptop at home and log in with my standard account just fine and connect to the VPN and work the entire day without issue. At the end of the day, I disconnect from the VPN and shut down my laptop or maybe I just lock it after disconnecting as I will be using it the next day (this is the most common). The next morning when I attempt to log on I receive the message that I cannot be logged in because my domain cannot be reached. The following is the process I have to go through to get logged in with my standard account.
 Log in with my admin account (for some reason this works just fine off the network, most likely due to being a local admin account)
 Connect to the VPN while logged in with my admin account
 Switch user and log in with my standard account
 Once logged in with my standard account, reboot the laptop, log back in with my standard account, reconnect to the VPN, and begin my day.
 This was not an issue on previous Windows 10 and 7 laptops so I am not sure what is causing this on 11, and it seems like it has gotten worse with recent updates. Has anyone else seen this and found a fix?

 We received our Monthly Account Assessment over the weekend and noticed an abnormally high number of inbound rejections towards the beginning of the month. Looking back at the same report for May we can see these started on 14th May. Normal daily inbound email values for us are around 10,000 and we can see these hitting 100,000+ through this period.
 Having dug into the rejections deeper using the info within Reporting -> CSV in the Mimecast portal it reads like a DDoS attack with multiple source IP addresses and randomised FROM addresses. The TO addresses are also randomised, so it doesn’t seem like a targeted attack from that point of view.
 Our main concern is that the TO domains extend to all our domains within both our Mimecast and 365 tenant, some of which are not in the wild as such and would normally see very few inbound emails. It’s as though someone had a complete list of our domains and sent high amounts of email to randomised addresses in a DoS attempt. Mimecast did its thing as these were rejected due to the sending IPs being in RBLs.
 We’re trying to determine whether this was unique to our organisation or whether Mimecast customers as a whole were targeted.
 Did anyone else experience this at all?

 To detect whether a hexnode device is viewing a web app we can use URL parameter wildcards which inject device variables like so:https://www.hexnode.com/mobile-device-management/help/pass-device-information-from-hexnode-to-the-web-apps-added-in-the-device-through-wildcards-faqs/
 For example, we could use the wildcard to check against the UDID of a device to determine if a client is a hexnode device and its location. But what if the UDID was to be leaked, anyone could just enter the UDID string and access the web app as that device. 
 My question is how can we implement secure authentication for devices accessing web apps to prevent unauthorized access?

While I have come across datasets that focus on URL-based data, my research specifically requires payload data. If anyone knows of any existing datasets that fit this criterion, I would greatly appreciate any information or links you can provide.
 Alternatively, if there isn't a readily available dataset, I would be more than willing to create my own dataset by classifying payload data myself. If any of you have access to a collection of payload data or any logs or know of any resources where I could find such data, I would be extremely grateful. I couldn't find it on Kaggle.
 Thank you in advance for your time and support. I look forward to hearing from this knowledgeable community!

 1: Configure the home page URL - string - [("website.name.here")]
 2: Block access to a list of URLs - string - [("*")]
 3: Allow access to a list of URLs - string - [("website.name.here")]
 It's assigned to the correct group and shows a successful install status. All other configuration policies are working correctly, including Managed Home, WiFi restrictions, exit kiosk, etc..

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi All,
 We are looking at changing legacy HDDs on our campus systems for above 1,000 Windows systems to an SSD or NVMe drive as their primary drive. The systems currently have individual data of each of our organization members' company user profiles along with maybe secondary HDDs of sizes varying from 500GB-2TB. We would only expect to move the primary drive which is usually no more than 1TB in size, average is 500GB.
 As this will be a large task for our small team to migrate the data from the existing drive to a new drive-through normal (home user) imaging tools the work is expected to take a few weeks or months to complete for all 1000 systems. 
 A few considerations we are still uncertain on:
  
If any suggestions on professional imaging tools are there for moving the content from the old (HDD) physical drive to the new (SSD) drive that can give us a rollout of maybe 100 systems per day over network backup/restore imaging methods then we can consider this. Have any approached something like this procedure before?
 If we are buying the SSDs in bulk as all the same model and capacity, we should not expect much fuss from Windows OS in the hardware imaging process as no other components (like motherboard, GPU, etc.) are being changed right?
 Should we expect potential data loss from bad sectors in existing HDDs being cloned to SSDs, maybe OS blue screen errors as the data might not be perfect in the old HDD?
 Any other precautions we should expect if we plan to do this in-house?
  
We are considering outsourcing this task to a vendor for fixed SLAs and agreements and having our users up and running in a known timeline with the least amount of downtime. I am not sure whether they will have data loss in their contract.
 Let me know what you think is the best approach here.
 Thanks!

 I've got a little problem with NM.
 I wrote a script and putted to /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/ folder. I've added chmod +x and restarted the NM service.
 The script is for testing purpose because i want to add a little more after that will work.
 #!/bin/bash echo "TEST | iface $1 state is $2" >> /var/log/iface.log 
 And now, the NM reacts only when i deactivated device using for example a nmtui tool, then i've got in logs down and up state. But it doesnt react when i unplug the cable or put that interface manually down using ifconfig iface down. The NetworkManager-dispatcher should invoke for a while when something happend with ifaces but nothing really happend and serivce says it's dead. But when i deactivate interface using nmtui it's works fine and Active state for a while.
 Could someone could help me with that? I've read a lot of website and even ask chat gpt but response was 'check the script, check the status of NM, restart NM' which doesnt helped at all.
 Edit: Oh, i forgot to mention that i use Redhat.

 I have one of the directors complaining at me regularly about how things just dont work and how it used to be better (before I showed up and 'changed everything')
 The things he like to complain about is MS Teams for starters, sharepoint, onedrive etc. He also has trouble with different headsets/speakers/devices any time theres a meeting and its somehow my fault too. A website I have nothing to do with was 'hanging' today and thats also my problem or the fualt of the brand new high spec laptop that was issued to him a month or so ago. Even things like searching for email being a pain in the outlook client (doesnt seem to search archived items) but working fine in OWA. 
 I think he just likes to complain, and im happy to stand and fight my corner, the other 100+ employees have no trouble, but this guy is impatient and unwilling to learn. Its frustrating to deal with, as much as its frustrating for him to feel like hes being held up by these technologies.
 I guess i dont know what im asking and am venting as much as anything else... does anyone else deal with this? Im lucky in that I dont repot to this guy, I think id have left pretty sharpish if that was the case.

 We have been managing multiple domains. There is no any trust relationship between domains. 
 - Not Enabled DNS Publish
 - Already activated 2022 KMS Key on 2019 OS Server (installed latest patch)
 - Joined KMS machine into domainA.local
 Already opened TCP 1688 port.
 I am using use the (Key Management Service (KMS)). NOT Active-Directory based activation.
 My question is : 
 1 - For testing purposes, I have installed fresh 2022 OS machine (WORKGROUP). Later I have ran those command like below.
 slmgr /skms KMS_Server_IP_Address:1688
 slmgr /ato
 As you can see attachment , I am getting a output for SLMGR /XPR is it normal ? it writing expiry time : 12/31/2023. 
 Will it cause any problems with activation?
 ​

 2 - I have been using VM machines. sometimes I am changing hardware for VMs such as CPU and/or RAM increase. Will it cause any problems with activation?
 3 - Also , I can't see my test 2022 machine inside VAMT Tool. How can I get report?

 Does anyone have any recommendations? We had been recommended to use hostinger but this does not do what we need it to because you can set up multiple users but you can't actually view billing \ account info separately from the main account which doesn't fit our needs.

 I have a pair of Nexus 5596 that are EoL but we have extended support on them through a 3rd party.
 Recently I have needed to run BGP on them so I enabled the trial to get us going and it seems that we will be needing this feature indefinitely. 
 My problem is, after contacting Cisco about purchasing the LAN enterprise license, I was told that I'm SOL because it's EoL and told to buy a new switches. 
 What are my options here? The grace period ends in about 20 days and I would like to continue using BGP on these cores as the other end only supports BGP. After looking it doesn't appear you can reactivate the trail (worth a look eh?).

 ​
 One of our customers asked us the question to export his 'Projects' Public Folders from Exchange Online. I thought it should be peanuts to do, but of course he couldn't make it too easy.
 Underneath the Projects folder we have 276 seperate folders, one for each project.
 What the customer wants is that we export each direct subfolder into a separate PST file. To make it more clear let's say we have 'Project A', 'Project B', 'Project C' folders. They sit directly under the 'Projects' PF. What the customer doesn't want is to have a 'ProjectS.pst' file from which he could scroll through the folder hierarchy, no. What he wants is to have a pst-file for 'Project A.pst', 'Project B.pst', which only opens the folder structure he needs at that moment.
 Do you guys have any ideas? I came up to a lot of shady-looking tools and tested some of them, but most of them are unable to export the public folders the way I want it.
 ​
 Thanks in advance for any advices.

 Long time lurker of this subreddit, finally got a job offer for a sysadmin role, yay!
 After working in HelpDesk for 3 years, I wanted to get more techy and start managing the stuff by myself.
 From those who went from HelpDesk to Sysadmin, how was the step? Was it a difficult one? I’m really excited for this because I’ll be the only IT there (there’s one other guy who has been managing their stuff there, but always with external support). 
 They want to start doing things the proper way, deploying a decent infrastructure and I also have to do a bit of user support, but that’s not an issue.
 Any tips are appreciated!

 We haven't made any big changes to our spam policies, however, now emails that are being classed as 'spam' by Exchange online, are being delivered to people's inboxes.
 Message trace states that its been delivered to the junk folder, but we know otherwise that its not the case
 Does anyone with the same issue even know where to BEGIN looking? Unsure if its Microsoft having an oopsie..

 I originally made a post in ITCQ, but someone DM'd me and told me to post it here for more traction.
 At the moment, I am currently looking for new opportunities and I was connected with one of the head guys for a Hotel chain that is currently looking for an IT Manager (for five of their hotels) to join in with the small team they have established. The position itself is mainly remote (WFH) as they have one or two other IT guys that are mainly onsite. The only time I have to check in/on the properties and deal with any updates/changes are for extra assistance.
 Those of you who worked in the Hotel IT, or any of the 'travel niche' side of the business, what are your general thoughts on the industry as a whole? 
 Thank you for your comments in advance!

Is there an issue running S/FTP into a (shielded 6a) keystone patch panel and F/FTP out of it?
 My thinking is that the grounding issues introduced by using UTP patch wouldn't be present, and I'd just be sacrificing some negligible level of interference protection within the racks, but I'd like the sense check from someone more knowledgeable.
 Somebody is going to tell me to make my own in the lengths I want... But it's hundreds of patch cables and I don't have the time to do it myself!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A few weeks ago we started getting reports of certain computers not waking up properly. Upon investigating, my techs found that the computers (Optiplex 7090 micros) would be normal sleep mode, and moving the mouse caused the power light to go solid and the fan to spin up, then... nothing. We got about 10 reports of this, out of a fleet of at least 50 of that model among our branch offices.
 There had been a recent BIOS update, so we tried rolling it back. That seemed to help for one or two boots, then back to the original problem. We pulled one of the computers, gave the employee a loaner, and started a deeper investigation. 
 So many tests. Every power setting in Windows and BIOS. Windows 10 vs Windows 11, M.2 Drives vs SATA, RST vs AHCI, rolling back recent updates... The whiteboard filled up with things we tried. Certain things would seem to work, then the computer would adapt like Borg to a phaser and the wake issue would recur.
 After a clean Windows install, one of my techs noticed that it seemed to only happened when the computer was joined to the domain. We checked into that, and sure enough, that was the case. Ok, a weird policy issue, finally getting somewhere. There was only one policy dealing with power, so we disabled that. No change.
 Finally, we created an Isolation Ward OU, and started adding GPOs one by one. Finally one seemed to be causing the wake issue... but it made no sense. It was a policy that ran a script on shutdown, that logged information to the Description field in Windows- Computer name, serial number, things like that. No power policies, it didn't even run on wake.
 We tested it thoroughly, and it seems definitive: A shutdown policy, that runs a script to log a few lines of system information, was causing a wake from sleep issue, but only on a subset of a specific model of a computer.
 My head hurts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm working with a client on a setting up IPSec VPN with BGP and wasn't sure if the existing routing BGP/EIGRP redistribution design would have any issues. Here are the details of the setup and topology
 https://imgur.com/a/WHVlUf0
 ​
  
Physical connectivity: HQ Campus, datacenter Silicon Valley, and datacenter Seattle are connected via dark fiber on Nexus 9K switches.
 EIGRP: The Nexus 9K switches in each location (SE-SW, SV-SW, HQ-SW) are running EIGRP to exchange routes internally.
 BGP: BGP is configured on the Nexus 9K switches for external routing. In Seattle, the Nexus switch (SE-SW) has a BGP peering with a Fortigate Firewall (SE-FGT) on AS 65010. In Silicon Valley, the Nexus switch (SV-SW) has a BGP peering with a Fortigate Firewall (SV-FGT) on AS 65011.
 Redistribution: The firewalls (SE-FGT and SV-FGT) are learning the 172.22.1.0/24 network from their respective Nexus switches (SE-SW and SV-SW) through EIGRP redistribution.
 Partner1: Both Fortigate Firewalls (SE-FGT and SV-FGT) have a BGP peering with Partner1, which advertises the 10.0.0.0/24 network.
  
Now, here are my questions:
  
Do I need to configure iBGP between SE-SW and SV-SW? Both Nexus switches are already exchanging routes via EIGRP redistribution, so is iBGP necessary in this case?
 Is it necessary to configure BGP peering between SE-FGT and SV-FGT? Since both firewalls are connected to their respective Nexus switches and are already learning routes from Partner1 through BGP, is direct BGP peering between the firewalls necessary?

 We have 9200 access switches that are hitting tcam limits on multicast, this is causing issues for unicast traffic as well somehow.
 Config wise we just have ip pim smarse dense mode enabled on uplinks and ip multicast enabled so super simple..
 We only really need mcast on voice subnets, is there anyway of stopping other subnets/blame from participating and reducing the load on the TCAM table
 Many thanks

 I have always been curious how actually networks interface with the physical boxes. For a company to make a switch, how do they add things like TCP/IP suite. How do they do they mac address learnings? How do they keep encrypted packet encrypted etc?
 I want to understand network from a very low level. Anyone ever had this sort of curiosity?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I work at a small shop, there are less than 10 of us, and I have sort of become the impromptu desktop engineer, I guess? My main function is desktop support. My predecessor would keep images of each desktop by model and processor. Right now we are using Dell desktops, and HP laptops. I was thinking we really just need to keep maybe 2 images? One for desktop, one for laptops. The desktops are 8th and 9th gen Intel CPUs, where the laptops are 8th to 11th gen Intel CPUs. I am using DISM to apply and capture images, and I sysprep the images. These are all "thin" images, just Windows 10 that was installed on them and decrapified/customized to our liking to get rid of OEM bloatware and keep the image size down. We will add to domain and install SCCM, etc later. Any reason to keep more than one image for each type of hardware/manufacturer? I know sysprep generalizes the image, removing hardware identifiers and such, and Windows 10 is pretty forgiving when it comes to different hardware. I just need to run Updates on the hardware after imaging, which I am already doing, correct? I tried googling this, but maybe not phrasing it correctly and just would like some advice from veterans. TIA!

The gateway provider gave us an IP range, and we created an Exchange mail transport rule (priority 0) to set the spam confidence level (SCL) to -1 for anything arriving from that IP range. This works great... except for one user. And this user is complaining quite loudly, all the way up to C-level.
 I just joined this company (SMB), it's a small team and everyone but the director has turned over in the past year. Seems a lot of things in this environment are held together with (figurative) glue & duct tape. I'm trying to approach this problem with a detective mindset as I don't know what's been done before me. What are some things I should check?

 I got hundreds of clients with their own, separate vlans. All currently going from datacenter A to datacenter B by path:
 ZTE ZXR10 5960 (A) <-> (B) Cisco Nexus 3064. Of course on both devices we got jumbo enabled.
 Currently we added Cisco Nexus 93180 to our set. It looks like this:
 ZTE ZXR <-(40g)-> Nexus 93180 <-(100g)-> Nexus93180 <-(40g)-> Nexus3064.
 After we switch to new 100g FO link some of the vlans in where clients put their vlans (qinq) stop working. Nexus 93180 all totally in switchport mode, no routing interfaces, on every interface I added: # mtu 9216, and so it shows on both devices in both datacenters to every direction. I am almost sure that this is somehow to inproper jumbo handling. Communities say - set „system mtu jumbo” but I have no such command, and after reading through manual - I can set up on interfaces manually (like I did).
 May I have any thoughts on this? Thanks in advance.

 From what I read online, atleast with other cisco switches, this is a software bug in other IOSXE versions. We are currently running 17.9.2 on this switch, and 17.9.3 is the newest software.
 Is this most likely another software bug, or is there something else I should check to fix this issue?

 Just curious if there is a quick fix for this error that will solve the issue immediately? Or is it definetly a software bug? I cannot do an update right away as I need to schedule an out*** with upper management, and that will take some time.

I don’t see any way to cancel this - do I need to contact the system administrator? I’m not sure what mimecast does except for scan links, but I don’t like the idea that my phone is now enrolled in it.

 We have activated the previous versions for a share on a server some time ago.
 -Logon is done directly on the server (Windows 2019).
 The previous versions are displayed for me and my college (local admins) until today. (31 versions/snaps)

 Does anyone know this problem?
 Any ideas?

As someone who has been working as a Windows administrator for almost two decades, I can't help but feel that the profession is gradually fading away. It seems that the new generation of tech enthusiasts are more drawn to DevOps, leaving traditional system administration behind. While I possess some coding skills and can handle infrastructure management, I have never officially held the title of a DevOps engineer. This raises concerns about the future of infrastructure management using Windows/VMware. Will on-premises solutions eventually become obsolete? Are DevOps professionals simply the new version of system administrators? I apologize for my scattered thoughts, but I am genuinely worried about my relevance in this evolving landscape.

 I'm looking for some recommendation to setting up some security cameras on an UK allotment site, I said I'd help them out.
 Being an allotment they don't have much money budget is 2k max but hoping to do this around 1k if possible. They do not have internet and due to no postcode can not get anything installed, the only power is at the "Office/Shed/Shop".
 I am famililarwith homelab software and IP cameras but wondering if this is the right solution? It needs to be simple to manage as well as the site managers are mostly retired and not tec savy. It would need to have decent storage 3-7 days rolling recording I think, and mutliple cameras, first thoughts are one on each corner and one inside. Should I use IP cameras and install a wireless router and POE setup or maybe look to use a coaxle setup instead?

 I am running into issues with WSUS on a new environment. I can't go into details, but it is an environment without internet connection.
 There is a WSUS server (Server 2022) with imported updates from an upstream server. The updates including metadata are imported successfully.
 The clients are also reporting to the WSUS server and the status of the clients in WSUS is 99%.
 The updates that are pulled from the WSUS server on the clients are stuck at downloading 0%.
 I've confirmed that I can reach the WSUS server IIS on port 8530 but the updates are stuck on all my clients.
 Disabling Windows Update service and deleting the files in SoftwareDistribution folder was not the trick. Windows defender firewall service is running.
 Would appreciate any tips about this one!

 I'm struggling to find out the root cause of this issue or a permanent solution to prevent this happening. These are brand new out the box hp laptops. 
 I am going to reimage one with a windows bootable usb (created within windows and no other 3rd party apps) but this is becoming increasingly common and frustrating.

 We have a company that helps us to install patch panels/cassettes and has the tool to join the fibers. We'd like to ask them to buy/expand their equipment to create patch cords, so that we may have them in a short time and with correct lenght (as they already do for copper).
 Does anybody make its own patch cords this way? Possible problems to be aware?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hyia, we're currently moving to a new school site and this will be the occasion to rearrange configuration and settings.
 We currently have these VLANs:
  
Core: Servers and on premise trusted workstations
 Staff: BYOD and mobile phones
 Guest: Students and guests
 Printers: to allow selected VLANs to print
 PBX: as it says
  
Now, apart from adding a videosurveillance system, which will use its own VLAN, we're wondering if it makes sense to separate servers (Active Directory) from on premise trusted workstations. 
 What we would achieve: 
  
Security: By segregating servers and workstations, you create a logical separation between them. This helps in implementing stricter security policies and access controls. Even if the server firewall is compromised, an attacker would still need to bypass additional security measures to gain access to the workstations' network.
 Reduced Attack Surface: Placing servers and workstations on separate VLANs limits the exposure of critical server resources to potential threats originating from workstations. It minimizes the attack surface, reducing the chances of unauthorized access, data breaches, or lateral movement within the network.
 Performance Optimization: Servers often require more bandwidth and have different traffic patterns compared to workstations. By segregating them on separate VLANs, you can prioritize and optimize network resources for server traffic, ensuring efficient communication and reducing the risk of congestion caused by workstation-related traffic.
  
Now thinking of the extra complexity layer added by the above setup. Implementing Inter-VLAN Routing, to allow for controlled communication between VLANs. By selectively permitting specific traffic between VLANs, you can ensure that essential services, such as DNS, DHCP, domain authentication, print queues, and file shares, remain accessible to workstations but this might be a long trial and error process
 Your thoughts?

 I have the opportunity to purchase an APC Back-UPS Pro 1500 or an APC Smart-UPS. The main difference I've noticed between the two is that the Smart-UPS offers a pure sine wave.
 In addition, both UPS models are available at a highly competitive price of 150€.
 What other factors should I consider in my decision? And which of the two models would you recommend?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi here's the problem - when you get a certificate drop-down selection prompt in Edge or Chrome, how do I prevent it from showing certificates belonging to previous users?
 https://textplain.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/image-7.png?w=1024
 Background - I'm in charge of a unusual project to create a kiosk mode Windows 10 account for a multi-user government computer. Most of the users rely on their government issued "PIV" cards for authentication to log into various websites. Even though this is a multi-user computer, the users are handling sensitive HR forms and privacy is important. I've configured the kiosk mode as such. But the certificate prompt they see where they see former users' cards and names is a disaster and a privacy violation.
 Right now I have a script running in the task scheduler that clears the certificate cache every 24 hours. But it's not a solution, just a workaround. Any ideas?

 I have 2 different GPOs in this example, one is directly under the Domain - Global GPO - and one is burried down in an User OU - Custom GPO.
 In my Global GPO I have set the Setting "Local Area Network (LAN) settings" to yes. This Setting is located unter User Configuration - Preferences - Control Panel Settings - Internet Settings - Internet Explorer 10: Internet Explorer 10 - Connections.
 This Setting works just fine.
 Now in my Custom GPO I have set the Setting "Local Area Network (LAN) settings" to no, and it does not override my Global GPO. I even tried to set it to forced and it didn't change anything.
 When I enter gpresult on an User affected by Custom GPO, it shows that the GPO is applied however, it shows Global GPO as the winning GPO.
 Am I missing something?
 edit: Global GPO is not set as enforced

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone,
 I'm new to whole sysadmin stuff. So the issue is nearly 10 servers of my institution went "dead" and not booting up at all. I have checked the GPUs and atleast one of them work, so its safe to assume that I can salvage the GPUs, but the technician said there is an issue with the Motherboard and that's why it isn't booting up anymore, no BIOS flash screen.
 I'm genuinely interested in re-using the hardware, there are atleast 40 GTX 1080Tis in there (each server has 4 GPUs in it.)
 The server racks were bought in 2016 when 1080Tis were a big deal. All of them are SuperMicro or Fujitsu systems.
 Any ideas what to do in order to reuse the compute power? The technician said the power supply is not manufactured of this model anymore, and the motherboards are hard to get, basically he is quoting for new purchase order altogether.
 Any ideas on how to proceed further?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I was wondering how everyone else in here are managing their certs. Currently we have a wildcard cert and a few other certs as well as some self-signed certs internally.
  
 But lately we have considered getting a seperate certificate for each of our public facing services instead of using the same wildcard cert for services.
  
 I'm curious if this will be a pain to manage or if there is a nice tool for this. We are using Azure quite heavily and i see they have an SSL store, but i would idealy like something that could potentially autorenew the certificates.
  
 It seems like Keymanager Plus from ManageEngine can do something like that.
  
 How is everyone else managing it? Any software recommendations?

It's just a fatter SPOF at this point no? Isn't the whole point of a lag redundancy + bandwidth? You're chopping off the other purpose entirely and it's preventing the lags from coming up anyway.
 These Junipers connect over to Cisco PE routers - is there some obscure compatibility issue I don't know about?
 In writing this it seems settings them to a lower count and then back at least let's them come up, still totally confused though.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Newbie here. So i've got an opportunity to work & impliment a network design for a small plant. Their existing design is that they are terminating all their ISPs in the Fortigate & from there they are getting a LAN network (10.3.70.0/23 - Gateway:- 10.3.70.1) to an unmanaged switch. They have few servers on that switch & from that switch they are giving uplink to other unmanaged access switches. My work here is to configure a Core switch(9300L) which will have VLANs for Data & Voice & will handle all the inter-vlan routing & DHCP request as well as default route to the Gateway (FW). Easy, but the catch is that i can not touch the Fortigate firewall or change anything there. 
  
If i divide the /23 network into two /24 network, will there be any issue in the FW?
 
Is there any way that can i put the servers on Data vlan(10.3.70.0/24) without changing their subnet mask?
 
Can i terminate the LAN from the FW to Core in the Data vlan as an access port or is there a better way.
 
 If you have any good suggestions than feel free to let me know. 
 *Sorry for the lengthy post. Thank you.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Come tomorrow morning all managers will be made aware that staff must submit tickets to the help desk if they want IT help. No more banging on my door or "paging" me. I used to put in the tickets for the staff to record my time, but I'm not doing it anymore, because of the abuse. Friday I got pulled in all different directions all because a staff member didn't realize a power adapter and outlet was not working and they had to keep their laptop charged. They literally didn't understand the concept of charging a laptop. :D It was two hours of fighting with managers about getting up and "fixing the problem," while I was in an unrelated meeting with my bosses.
 My two main questions are should I deactivate my personal extension? I don't see the need for it really. I'm not really ever going to be answering it again. My team has my cell phone number and our slack channel. It will get in the way of the enforcement and the users will have the help desk main line that they can call. The only people who may need to call me is an outside vendor but I do have another number they can use.
 Also another question is, how does a user submit a ticket if they have no internet at their workstation? I am assuming that they tell their supervisor and they put in the ticket? How does it work for you guys?

 I, a lowly sysadmin, humbly beseech you for information on a Cisco issue I have been having. Please see fit to provide the information you may have to help me.
 I've been tasked with updating the firmware of 5 Cisco 9200L-48 switches in the education lab I'm in charge of. The firmware file I received worked fine on the first three, but the last two are saying that the calculated md5 hash doesn't match the embedded md5 hash, and so they won't use it. I've tried with both 17.6.5 and 17.9.3. (I tried the 17.9.3 first, because it was what I was given, and after that didn't work, I thought to ask for the 17.6.5 as an intermediate step.) I've tried multiple downloads of each, but keep getting the same error.
 Now, not being a habitual Cisco person, I've been using the web gui to do these updates. I am well aware more netadmins prefer to use the cli, but I am just not good at the Cisco cli, so I avoid it. If there is something in the cli that I can use rather than the web gui, I'm willing to try it. I just don't know enough about the cli to know what to try right now. 
 As for going to my corporate net admins, they are overloaded, and don't respond to tickets for months, so I can't really do much there. I'd rather not uselessly add to their workload, with them in that situation. So, any help for me would be helping them.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Purpose, trying to backup about 14TB of data from a server to 2 NAS's. Server seems to max out @ 1Gbps.
 Recently, I added a 10Gbit SFP+ NIC into our Dell T430 server. Purchased 2 SFP+ MM Fiber 10Gbit fiber modules along with a 10Gbit MM fiber cable. Running a Unifi US-48-500W switch (Flow control/Jumbo Frames enabled). SFP+ Modules & MM fiber cable go directly from server SPF+ Port to SFP+ Port on switch.
 Windows shows full 10Gbit connection (Verified in Device Management that "Speed and Duplex" are set to "10Gbps Full Duplex") and Unifi Shows a 10Gbit connection in the console.
 We have 2 main NAS's configured in 802.3ad LACP (One Synology DS416 and one WD EX4100 both with RAID 5 4x 8TB drives) Both show 2000Mbps connections.
 T430 has 8x 8TB Drives and when copying a file (Not through network) from RAID to SSD boot drive, achieves ~360MBytes. So I know the RAID is at least capable of those speeds.
 Copying files from RAID to either single NAS averages around 110MBytes. I understand that LAG does not increase transfer speeds for single client as it will just use one connection technically.
 However, when trying to transfer data from the server to both NAS's, the Server NIC pegs out at 1GBit. Both NAS's should be able to take at least 1Gbit each and the server should be putting out 2GBits total.
 Also tried copying one file from Server to NAS and copying another file from Server to Desktop PC at the same time. Originally transfers around 100MBps and as soon as the 2nd file transfer starts, the server file transfer speeds are split between the two to about 50MBps each.
 Thoughts/Idea's anyone?

 I am put on a new project/product that has been acquired and the people who worked on it has just left with no documentation. I am now asked to figure out the bare bones of the infrastructure so it can be moved over to the main company. They are thinking of potentially recreating it, which is weird but they want the option in case. 
 They want me to get an inventory of what is in there and how much it costs.
 The infrastructure as I see it is in Azure.

Specifically in relation to guest accounts that are automatically created when documents from sharepoint are shared externally with guest users. However I am not clear on how this was setup within 365 and I can't find documentation related to this specifically.
 I did locate Sharepoint setting: "Guest access to a site or OneDrive will expire automatically after this many days" - However based on what I read in the documentation, this is not the setting that has generated the below email notification.
 ​
 Are any of you aware on how to set this up? 
  
This is an automated email from "Organization" - your "Organization" guest account is about to expire.
  
This email address is registered as having 'guest' access to some shared information or services with "Organization" systems. As this guest account access has not been used recently (almost 90 days) your account access is about to expire and be deleted.
 "Organization" Guest accounts must be used every 90 days to retain their active status. To renew your access - simply log into the "Organization" system to which this account was invited; or contact your "Organization" contact person.

 When playing around with the Hyper-V, I noticed that some Group Policies were accessed from the local computer. To be clear, we're talking about GPMC, not GPEdit (or Local Policies). What I did on my Hyper-V, not on the DC but the PC which accesses GP on it, I installed some templates on it.
 Do the templates NEED to be installed on the DC or only the PC used to access the Group Policy Management Console? Would these policies, when abled, have any effect on the client PCs where the GP applies?

 Can any sysadmins working in Texas speak to the quality of life down there? I'm thinking of relocating.
 The average rent for a 1 br apartment in Vancouver increased to $2,850 this year, and it just feels like we're working hard for nothing, with no prospect of home ownership at the end of it.
 If I ever want to buy a 2 br home in Vancouver, this is what the market's like. (And remember: all this in a city where the average income is $61,000. A lot of IT jobs here don't pay significantly more than that.)

 I've been looking into labels, specifically the bluetooth one, such as - niimbot, phomemo, brother cube,etc. And have just realised that most of them are shown to be printing black on white, and never the other way around. Are these thermal bluetooth label makers able to do it - print white on black, or does the printer have to have some special technology?
 Whichever it may be, please give me recommendations for good label printer/makers (that are able to print white on black ofc xd).

 what are the chances of that?
 I've purchased new enterprise grade ssds, and have fixed the backup system. Now its time to recover the bits of the VMS that died and rebuild.

 Just after a bit of insight into how the company you work for offers training to its IT staff?
 I work for a large company in a 3rd Line role and have been with them for around 5 years. In that time I cannot remember any meaningful training that's been offered to me either individually or as a team and its incredibly frustrating. We get the standard corporate crap like heavy lifting, gdpr, modern slavery, etc etc but no training for our roles.
 As an example, we've recently moved over to azure and although I have quite a lot of access within it, I have received zero training on it from the business. The access for the team gets less as you go down the levels e.g. 1st line and 2nd line have restricted access and can only do certain things like add someone to a group.
 We have a knowledge base but I wouldn't say it's the best - we do try to keep it up to date though as much as possible. 
 What does your company offer you? If anything? Or do you just learn in your own time? 
 I'm interested to find out if anybody has time set aside for them to train e.g. Comptia courses, azure fundamentals - stuff like that. 
 I find I have to use my own time to train which I don't think I should be doing.

 offline install of same .msu updates in Audit Mode + sysprep + DISM image capture 
 run online Windows Update in Audit Mode + sysprep + DISM image capture

This slows the whole setup down and is driving me crazy.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi people,
 For a project I want to extend routing from the host into the VM. VMs run in KVM. So basically VM->Vm-Host->Leaf->Spine, and so on. 
 My first idea was to create a bridge, add the VMs interface and a dummy interface on the host to it and have a routing daemon run on both “sides”. On the host have routing between the dummy interface and physical interface setup. Repeat for each VM that runs on the host. But this doesnt sound like a very good design and is cumbersome, bc extra bridge for each VM. 
 Would that even work? What would be a better idea? 
 Cheers and thanks!

 Does anyone have any experiences going from a small IT team at a small/mid-size company to a huge company with like hundreds of IT staff, and in-house development, etc? How hard of an adjustment was it for you? What did you like most about going to a huge company? What did you dislike the most moving to a huge company? What about the interview process at a huge company vs a small company? 
 or maybe share an experience going in the opposite direction from a huge company to a very small company?

 Hi everyone! Has anyone tried using OMADA and tp link products for SCHOOL WIFI ZONE CAMPUS WIDE use? About 5000 concurrent users.
 Here's the Plan: There will be 5 buildings and Im planning to use PTP to bridge the connection from Server room at the main building to the other 4 buildings. (Its a big campus and they do not allow cables to cross on each buildings). Then setup a wired AP (EAP610) per floor. Other APs will be configured as MESH per floor with the wired AP as their main AP. 
 Can you give me advice, feedback or recommendations with this setup? Thank you.

 I had this idea to secure more my server and wanted your advice:
 Imagine for example if:
 1- I configure Restricted ssh access to my server by IP Address
 /etc/hosts.allow 
 sshd,sshdfwd-X11: 192.168.2.111 192.168.2.101 
 /etc/hosts.deny 
 sshd,sshdfwd-X11:ALL
 2- I configure restricted wp-admin access in nginx conf
  
 location ~ ^/(wp-admin|wp-login\.php) {
 allow 1.2.3.4;
 deny all;
 } 
 If now there is a wordpress vunerability that allow the attacker to upload a shell backdoor to my website. will he still be able to modify files in website directories, gain access, ect... ? How usefull are restrictions like this ?

They liked my experience and said how they wanted to hire quickly and asked me when I could start. It even turned slightly casual when they asked me about my hobbies.
 Is this a good sign? They'll tell the agency after the 4th of July weekend.,

 I have followed this blog for a while, I love the fact we have a successful business resource saying what the technical teams already knew, the cloud isn't cheap!
 From my point of view I am at the other end of the process with management coming along every 6 months or so saying why don't we "use the cloud" - the general first response is why should we.
 When I run the numbers again and show it increasing our infrastructure costs by 250% they go away again for a few months. The one quantifiable I don't include in figures is staffing to run the physical hardware, mainly because from experience outside of replacing hardware, our team going to server room is probably a once a month event. Running a VM in VMware doesn't need more manpower than running on Aws. The fact the move back to on prem required no extra staff is a confirmation of this.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi
 I was wondering if someone could help me with this. I am seeing a lot of alerts for the event ID 4625 - Account Failed To Log On. 
 Below is a example:
 An account failed to log on.
 Subject:
 Security ID: S-1-0-0 Account Name: - Account Domain: - Logon ID: 0x0 
 Logon Type: 3
 Account For Which Logon Failed:
 Security ID: S-1-0-0 Account Name: TomJones Account Domain: mydomain 
 Failure Information:
 Failure Reason: An Error occured during Logon. Status: 0xC00002EE Sub Status: 0x0 
 Process Information:
 Caller Process ID: 0x0 Caller Process Name: - 
 Network Information:
 Workstation Name: - Source Network Address: - Source Port: - 
 Detailed Authentication Information:
 Logon Process: Kerberos Authentication Package: Kerberos Transited Services: - Package Name (NTLM only): - Key Length: 0 
 We are seeing a large number of these events within our monitoring systems, which I believe may also be the cause of our current where multiple users are getting locked out randomly. 
 I have cleared cached passwords on the users machine ( credential manager), purged their KLIST, removed invalid passwords from their Edge browser which uses SSO, but still no change.
 I spoke to one user when the alert came through and they stated they had not been near their laptop. These events are network related as the logon type is 3.
 The status code indicates - STATUS_UNFINISHED_CONTEXT_DELETED
 A security context was deleted before the context was completed. This is considered a logon failure. 
 I am not sure what this means exactly.
 Has anyone come across something like this similar?
 Thanks

Like sure we can see the cpu usage and how much traffics are going in and out. But that's it. There's no logging whatsoever. I'm no expert in that field but ideally shouldn't we have some logs about all the configurations in the router? Like when a user added an IP Address, a change in interface configuration, etc etc. Also details each traffics from each IP and VLAN should be logged to a certain extent no? The thing is, let's say that there's a 1 second spike in the traffic, but no one was paying attention at the time and only realized it few minutes later. Then we wouldn't know what happened and from which IP or VLAN that spike came from. In Mikrotik there's the "Torch" function to monitor real time traffic only for selected interface. But no logging at all which i think is really necessary.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ladies and gents,
 I'm at somewhat of a cross road, I'm making as much as a generalist would make, or so I think. I'm looking for a career change for a few reasons, 1) moar money, duh. 2) WFH FTW!. 3)More options in the future.
 We're all familiar with the dead end tech support, customer support positions so I'm not gonna go into that rant/vent here. As I've always learn by doing, I hardly have certificate/certifcations under my belt to show for what I can do.
 What I can do: recently got CCNA, CCNP is well within reason. LPIC-1 is probably low hanging fruit too, might strive for LPIC-2. Most recent dabbling with python & powershell. Not a front end guy, but back end, bring it on.
 So, I'm going to hunker down and get certs to try and get myself another position. The way I see it, I can either go into product customer support, which would somewhat limit myself to my employer's products, but that can be lucrative. Or go into DevOps/SRE/Data Analyst.
 Any advice on which to focus on, or something else I'm not aware of, and the path to it, that'll be great. WFH is definitely a must for me, as I planned to WFH and move some place with lower cost of living before my current job which doesn't allow WFH. If I can manage to double employ down the road, even better.
 So lay it on me, guys.

 I heard from another student this guy was bored, so he uploaded a Windows ISO file (~4 GB) multiple times. We're no way near our shared storage limit but it's just annoying af.
 How would you handle this? Could go the formal reprimand route and tell him to stop wasting storage space but just wondering what would happen if I applied a storage quota once someone's already over the limit?
 I had a look in the log files but it only seems to show the names and times uploads occur, rather than sizes of files.

 My colo facility says their racks are 48 U tall starting at 1 and have the industry standard 19” mounting width. Unless there is something I don't understand, my servers 17.2 will not fit in side 19" with rails right?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have recently been put in charge of an expanding project for my manufacturing company. We are adding a bunch of operation technology to the manufacturing floor and the problem I am running into is that the machines on the floor are using a standard IP scheme that is apparently not able to change at mass scale and the problem is, each manufacturing line uses around 40-50 "IPs" locally which I am not sure what they are but for example sake lets say they are 192.168.1.0/24 network. Now the IT Network is 10.5.1.0/25 per manufacturing area. Only one or two of the devices within the 40-50 devices in the 192.168.1.0/24 subnet need to be able to export its data to the 10.5.1.0/25 subnet that contains a server collecting the data. How we have been currently doing that is one to one NAT's with port level NAT's using industrial DINN network switches. The problem I am trying to solve with this, is that this requires a switch per device since these switches we are using only have 2 or 4 ports on. One port for the 192.168.1.0 IP and one for the IT Routable subnet. What I am wanting is either a fix to this without re-IPing the machines but a more central device that can handle the NAT's. I am thinking a 48 port switch that I can basically NAT the machine IP's in mass? Anyone got Ideas? If I am completely missing an easy solution please no hate.
 ​
 EDIT:: So the IE-2000, Could I implement that back at the Network cabinet and terminate all of the devices needing connected to it then have one uplink port to the OT Network and configure L2NAT instances for each interface?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Trying to grab a users certificate from ldap system. Able to grab it though it shows up as an attribute type. I can convert that to a string but that gets me nowhere really.
 When I use ldapsearch via terminal i'm getting a base64 encoded string from the query for "usercertificate;binary" which I can convert to binary to toss up into my own AD. When I run it through by python though i'm getting a byte string b'0\x84\x939\usercert info\x393\'etc etc.
 with ldap3.Connection(server, auto_bind=True) as conn:
 conn.search("base", "(uid=$username)", attributes='*')
 Then I can just do a test = conn.entries[0] and call test.usercertificate to get the data.
 if I do a type against it I get <class 'ldap3.abstract.attribute.Attribute'>
 I'm trying to either:
 1) Download usercertificate;binary and be able to reupload it into my internal AD
 2) convert what I'm getting into something you can import up into AD, such as a straight binary value or something else.
 I've only dabbled in python with other projects so getting into the deepend with this. I suppose I could also just do a sys call against ldapsearch to get the value I want but figured there has to be a way to do this in python itself.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hey guys! First time posting here, I hope it’s not a duplicate.
 I’ve been desperately trying to figure out a solution to this issue that was assigned to me by my senior team member, thus leading me here.
 We have two Synology NAS (DS920+), each loaded with 14TBx4 disks. The first one is used as main storage, we got the same one to expand our storage, and I figured it’s easier from a client’s pov to have both NASes joined together as a whole storage.
 What i came up with was mount both nfs shares on a VM, unify them with mergerfs and then re-export from VM. It worked but as my senior team member said it’s a single point of failure, therefore I duplicated the VM then spawned another one as a load balancer (HAProxy), but in the end it did not work as NFS refused to mount the LB IP.
 I want to know if it’s possible to unify them under a shared volume or one NFS export.
 I heard about Ganesha and gluster fs but I did not find anything or anyone using it for a similar use case of mine.
 Does anyone have an idea how to scale out nas synology? I’m somewhat desperate and any help is highly appreciated

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We had a bad switch that started spewing malformed broadcasts onto the subnet at a satellite office. No big deal. It was older, so we replaced it. I configured it based on the configuration of the switch that went bad. I could have swore it was a /23 network.
 This, of course, was a weekend, and come Monday we had endpoints with “stuck” IP addresses that refused to renew, and weird SIP problems where calls went through without problem, but conversations were suddenly muted. I suspected a NAT problem so I went on the hunt. Two days later I still found nothing and felt defeated.
 So, there are a number of issues that lead to this, many of which “existed before me”, but I’m here now and the bottom line is it was my fault. The big boss figured it out and all I could do was slap myself on the forehead. It was originally a /24 network. We reconfigured the PBX and all downstream appliances to use a /23 space. Within 10 minutes all was well.
 Lesson learned was always verify the IP space you are working in. I could have saved myself a lot of time, frustration and embarrassment.
 BTW: I know this is more netadmin stuff. Like many of us my sysadmin duties really run the gamut. So I thought I’d share the lesson here.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I have seen the earlier posts regarding DCU but they stop short of some detailed info that would be helpful. 
 What I am thinking is:
  
Use TDM (Tech Direct Dell) to create driver packages, BIOS, tools, etc. That allows me to download a Zip file
 Put the unzipped BIOS files (for example) on the source directory of the SCCM MP. 
 Replicate these folders/files to the DP's (using Package\Program)
 Run a command which copies these folders to the local machine (say, C:\Source)
 run the DCU-CLI with appropriate switches to install the updates from the Source folder
 Setup the ADMX Template to turn off Dell.com as a source
  
​
 When thinking a bit further, these drivers, etc are many Gigs of data and will fill things up if I do this repetitively without deleting them periodically.
 This model may not make the best sense, and alternatively I could have the computers run the DCU-CLI and point it to the DP's to get the updates. 
 Ideas? Suggestions?
 I've been playing with the switches to try this using just a \\server\share and have not been able to use the UNC path appropriately (not certain which switch specifies the \\server\share), but more problematic is how to have computers in a remote site point to the local DP to scan and apply. 
 Has anyone done it this way? thanks!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Earlier post asking about V6 adoption. Dinosaur here, recollecting that the big issue for adoption late-90s early 2000s was that the design/policy was that enterprise V6 allocations were only from an ISP, there would be no Provider-Independent allocations. (I think this was because v4 routing tables were outpacing router memory at the time. Having ISP allocation allowed greater summarization) Naturally there was a storm every time this policy was brought up on NANOG. If one wanted to have more than one upstream for resiliency, there would be two entirely separate V6 address spaces. So a complex protocol came out of the Network Working Group: RFC 5533, Shim-6: Multi-homing Shim Protocol. When the policy was inevitably changed to PI allocations I felt so sorry for the folks who must have spent many meetings working out the Shim Protocol. PI address space allocation was the beginning of the long adoption process.

 I'm trying to make a career change into IT and am currently learning about Active Directory and creating my own. With VirtualBox I created a virtual machine and installed Windows Server 2019 to use as my domain controller. I promoted it to a domain controller and added the AD tools and everything seems fine. 
 With another virtual machine I installed Windows 10 to connect to the domain controller. Everytime I try to connect to the domain I get the error: An Active Directory Domain Controller for the domain could not be contacted. 
  
The domain name is correct and being spelled correctly. 
 I've made sure to change the Windows 10 computer DNS to the IP address of the DC. 
 Both computers are able to ping each other successfully with both IP Addresses and computer names.
 I've disabled the firewall on each computer to ensure certain traffic isn't being blocked.
  
After all of this I'm still getting the same error. Can someone point me in the right direction to what I may be missing?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[So, our engineers have been tasked with setting up a 12 server (Windows 2019 Server) environment to run software for a manufacturing plant. These were likely member servers that were dis-joined from their domain and placed within their own domain. One of the tasks I was given was to harden the security via GPOs. 
 The second I popped into Group Policy Editor, I was greated with a warning that was something to the effect that it couldn't sync (I forgot exactly what it was when I looked at it yesterday). It does appear that it retained some of the previous policies from the previous domain. I created some of the policies like not allowing anonoymous logins and basic objects of that sort, but some of them lost out on the winning GPO that was in place. I deleted a few of them, but they are sticking on the other servers creating issues with service accounts that the software needs to run. I even tried writing new policies to reverse them, but am still having issues with them sticking. 
 I know the proper thing to do would be to rebuild the entire domain, but we don't have the time frame given to us to complete. I'm probably just overthinking this, but is there a way to rip everything out and redo all of the policies? TIA!!!

 I'm working for a company that has oil wells spread across several thousand acres of land. We are looking into the feasibility of a multiyear effort to fit all of the wells with various kinds of sensors and detectors, which will give us maintenance data a lot faster.
 I'm just posting here to get a general sense of the options that are out there. We will hire a network consultant at some point down the line, but for now I'm just putting together a presentation for the higher ups about this potential project, and I wanted to be able to add additional details about the technologies we would use and perhaps a very rough budget.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our environment has 5 hosts, two of which are out of support, a Dell R620 and two R630's along with two R740xd's that are still supported until late 2025. Our storage arrays are a Dell VNXe 3200 which is long out of support and a Unity 300 and HPE Nimble that are going up next year. My original thought was to replace all of it with a new HCI cluster but there is a fear that it's "too much" for our environment of about 40 VMs. As a result, I've been asked to look into a traditional SAN solution to replace it instead. 
 Considering what we have, the most cost-effective option would seem to replacing all 3 storage arrays with 2 new storage arrays, keeping the R740xd's while dropping the 3 other hosts, and adding in one new host. It would be the minimum amount of hardware to replace and while it kicks the can down the road on our remaining hosts, we'd have over two years before they need to be replaced.
 Any thoughts or other suggestions that I may be overlooking?

 I (fullstack web dev) have proposed to develop an in-house tool using a Flask API and Vue.js frontend as our SAP tools weren't cut out for the job (company never did development, but they recognize the utility in a developer so they hired me to improve UI development).

 Im in my late 20s, I intend to work in/around networking for the rest of my career, so that leaves me with around 30 more years in this industry. From a selfish point of view, I hope we just keep using IPv4.
 But if I’m not wrong, Asia is using more and more IPv6 so that leaves me wondering if I’m 5/10 years, IPv6 will overtake IPv4.

 We're all familiar with the warning message we receive when accessing a new server via SSH, indicating that the server's hash isn't in our known_hosts file. We're prompted to type "yes" to confirm access, and once we do, the warning doesn't show up again for that server.
 I'm curious to know if anyone has ever found this warning to be genuinely helpful in their sysadmin career. Has it ever prevented you from connecting to a fake server? In my experience, I always end up typing "yes" when I see this message, even when a server has been rebuilt and its hash has changed. This makes me wonder if the warning is as useful as it's intended to be.
 Please share your thoughts and experiences on this topic. Thanks!

They are in an mlag configuration with servers dual connected to both switches. The switches have l3 links up to the spines. We want to guarantee the upgrades go as smooth as possible with no traffic loss. 
 Wondering if someone that has done this has any tips they would like to share
 What we are planning to execute is the following 
 Drain l3 traffic ( bgp as path prepend advertisement the spines)
 Shutdown all host facing ports and uplink s
 Stop / disable clagd
 Shutdown peer link 
 Perform upgrade
 Bring up peer link 
 Enable / start clagd 
 Remove as path prepend 
 Bring up ports ( at this point nvidia said ports will only be single connected because they switches will be running different version) 
 Switch roles make primary secondary 
 Then do the same steps.

We had our providers on calls all day long doing traces to find the issue with no success so far ... Until we came across a comment way low in a BleepingComputer article.
 The comment mentions that enabling the Windows service "Routing and remote access" helped them fix a similar issue.
 We were skeptical as this is usually used on a server and not on workstations, but we tried it anyway and... Well damn... It actually works. All packet drops stopped.
 We are currently working with Microsoft and our VPN provider to identify what the service changes in Windows that affect this issue.
 If you are having strange stability and packet drops on VPN, give that a try maybe.
 Disclamer: I do not know all consequences of enabling this service yet. Use at your own discretion and risk.

 Supports costs $10,000s / year & yet some sysadmins take it as a personal insult. Even issues that are urgent and they're still working on a week later while users are screaming......oh we're still looking into it........LOG THE FUCKING CALL!!!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi,
 I was wondering what everyones offboarding procedure is. We are running on-prem AD synced to Azure with AD connect. Moving towards making the on-prem ad redundant. But it takes time and it's still used for servers and a bunch of legacy stuff. Either way our offboarding procedure is just weird to me. It works, bjt we have a tonne of disabled users and the number only grows. 
 Currently our procedure is as follows:
  
 Right away:
  
User is disabled disabled
 
Password is reset reset
 
user is removed from all groups (effectivly removing licences as this is applied using groups)
 
user is added to a single group that gives them an exchange online plan 1 license license
 
user is converted to a shared mailbox
 
 -1 other user gets access to their mailbox and 1 forward is made. To the same user or another user( chosen by the manager)
  
 After 2 months:
  
add old_ prefix to users mail address and UPN UPN
 
remove delegation and forward
 
  
 Now i guess my question is, at what point do we just delete the user account? Security are worried that deleting a user will also remove them from our sentinel and other logs. Or at least make it harder to trace the logs. But at some point i think that this is irrelevant. Nobody investigates 12months + old logs?
 How do ylu habdle offboarding?

I feel like I am technically pretty good but I find myself having tasks or tickets being open for weeks because I can't distribute my time on them efficiently. I often spent several days focused on a task and the others get procrastinated on. I feel I could work straight for weeks and never run out of work and I can never shake off the feeling that I'm not being efficient. My question is, how do you guys manage your time so that there is a healthy balance between your tasks and avoid constantly pushing the "smaller stuff" for later? Should I get into some project managing courses or something?

 New teacher comes in with only an iPad, and any attempt to get AirPrint in CUPS to work has been naught, always returning "You do not have permission to use this printer". Already spent a couple of days poring through articles online to setting up AirPrint/Bonjour through Avahi, no dice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm making my first attempt at setting up FOG Server to deploy images for 4 different Windows 11 buildouts that will need to go onto mix of desktops and laptops. I've been able to get all the way through registering an image, but I'm stuck at deployment. I'm still trying to figure this thing out, and I feel like I'm missing something simple.
 I'm using VirtualBox to create the VMs for the FOG host, FOG server, and the Windows 11 golden image. The FOG host is Ubuntu Server 22.04, FOG Server is version 1.5.10. DHCP is set to the FOG Server IP in 066, and I have 067 set to snponly.efi. On the golden image, I have generic apps (Chrome, Everything, VLC Player, Office365,) as well as larger installs for SolidEdge and AutoCAD Viewer. I went through sysprep and created an answer file for unattended installation for UEFI, and have a volume license key as well, so I'm covered there. I then was able to successfully register and then capture the image in FOG.
 ​
 Where I'm stuck: I've tried deploying this on a physical desktop as well as a VM, and this is as far as I get:
 Filename: snponly.efi
 thtp://10.xx.xx.xx/snponly.efi... ok
 snponly.efi : 274944 bytes [PXE-NBP (may be EFI?)]
 Nothing happens beyond that point. I've tried using ipxe.efi as the boot file, and I get the error could not boot image: exec format error. I feel like this is something simple that I'm overlooking. 
 Any help and/or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I do pro bono work for a nonprofit organization. They called me on Wednesday morning and informed me that some websites were not working for all users. Additionally, Outlook had issues. Upon investigation, I discovered that major websites like YouTube and Facebook were displaying SSL certificate errors. In the Chrome web console, I noticed recurring reconnection errors. The organization mentioned that they had recently upgraded their Comcast connection and were told that their modem was outdated. Consequently, I advised them to contact Comcast and request a replacement. A technician replaced the modem, tested it, and confirmed that all sites were functioning properly on his PC.
 However, when I reevaluated the situation tonight, I discovered that connecting a PC directly to the modem resulted in the same issue. Changing the DNS settings did not resolve the problem. After spending two hours troubleshooting, I found a temporary fix by enabling DNS over HTTPS, which resolved the issue for everything except Outlook.
 I am aware that this is not a long-term solution. Based on my best guess, this appears to be an issue with Comcast. However, persuading them to acknowledge and address the problem may prove challenging since they rely on the Comcast modem for DNS and DHCP services. Since not all devices support DNS over HTTPS, I need to find an alternative solution.

 OK, I just got a job, they paid my moving expenses and I started 3 weeks ago.
 In those 3 weeks, 2 weeks of time entries have been changed from around 52 hrs down to 32 & 40 since we are on 9/80 work weeks with every other Friday off. Looks like they missed a week.
 US law applies, so my understanding is that you must submit accurate timesheets regardless of whether you are in a salaried position or not. This has not affected my 2 paychecks so far, but I am concerned about my future reviews and promotions since my work is not being accurately shown.
 I'm coming to you guys for advice on how to proceed, I am a very direct and confrontational individual and do not want to start off on a bad foot, but feel this is very wrong. I have checked with my immediate supervisor who got a BS answer from HR about payroll only being used to bill vendors. And I have checked with 2 others on my team and their timesheets are correct and accurately reflect their 50 hour weeks, so I am at a loss.
 Thanks guys, I know some great advice is coming my way..
 EDIT: Some of you just really don't understand..
 I am being told to lie about the number of hours I work. This is not acceptable period. Not to mention against the law and probably in violation of SOX. 
 With no official record of my time, if something were to happen I have no recourse.
 NM state law is very clear on this matter:
 50-4-9. Records, subpoenas, etc.
 A. Every employer shall keep a true and accurate record of hours worked and wages paid to each employee. The employer shall keep such records on file for at least one year after the entry of the record.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I worked 2nd line support for 3 years at my current company. Left for a consultancy gig but one year in an opening appeared for an MS 365 engineer at my precious company. I thought 'hey fuck it, I'll just apply to see where I'm at and learn what I am lacking.'
 To my surprise I got the job. I'm now part of the team that I used to escalate things to and ask for help. Awesome. But my teammates all have decades of experience more than me and it shows in meetings. When we go over stuff that we did the past week and have in the agenda, I always feel like it's the equivalent of them saying 'I've updated VMware tools, migrated x from our data center to y, configured our Cisco Firepower to do this and that' and then there's me saying 'I deployed my first Autopilot pc.'
 They knew about my experience, they know what I'm capable of but I feel like a massive loser in my team. I'm trying my hardest to gain experience by shadowing them, doing self study about Intune and our whole cloud environment but fuck me, I feel like a junior first line guy all over again.
 I know I'm not technically a sysadmin but I feel like/hope that some people in here know what I'm talking about and how to cope.
 Sorry about the rant, I learned so much from you guys on a technical level. Maybe I can get some mental advice too.

 I'll start by saying that I work for an MSP that supported our local airport for some specific parts of their infrastructure (we don't anymore, thankfully) and one thing I can say is that their servers used for baggage sorting is running on super old citrix machines running Server 2003 OS, and there was no sign that they would upgrade anytime soon. But hey, at least their corporative servers were on Server 2019.
 I'm interested in some of your stories about just how outdated is infrastructure that we're all so reliant on.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Got a performance review back today and apparently got maximum points everywhere but customer service. Issue is it is claimed I am too fast to say "not the network." Crazy thing is I cannot remember one time I said "not the network" and was wrong. Someone says, "it's a routing issue" and I am like, "um there are 600 other endpoints in that subnet... if it was a routing problem, none of them would work." OR I send the ticket back... "What have you done to troubleshoot? Sounds like an authentication issue ... the network isn't broken just because the supplicant on the device isn't doing 802.1x properly, or it isn't joined to the domain OR it isn't getting the group policy. All those things aren't the network.
 Ultimately, I deployed ISE securing the network and now everything on my side is working but others blame the network each time a device cannot authenticate. It's like I secure the network and do my part then when it doesn't work, they are mad at me when I don't' manage devices and pass it back to the useless teams that do nothing whatsoever but pass every damned ticket to our NOC. I cannot single handedly deal with every individual devise that acts up out of 50,000 total each time a devices cannot connect to the network.
 Am I wrong for not wanting to do a bunch of handholding for IT people?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, I'm preparing for a computer communication exam and want to make sure I am calculating subnets correctly.
 Let's say I have the IP 129.19.40.0/25. I am told to subnet it into three subnets: A, B, and C, where:
  
A has 11 hosts
 B has 12 hosts
 C has 45 hosts
  
Is the following approach correct?
  
Take log₂(#hosts + 2) -- adding 2 for network ID and broadcast addresses. So for instance in the case of subnet A I get: log₂(13) = 3.7 --> and rounding up I find that I need 4 bits.
 Then I take the number of bits and adjust the subnet mask accordingly, so again in the case of subnet A instead of using /25 I would use /28 (because the 4 LSB are 0)
 Now I want to find the range of IPs for the subnet, so for subnet A I will start from 129.19.40.1 (since .0 is reserved) and go til 129.19.40.14. The addresses ---.1 and ---.14 here will be the network ID and broadcast addresses, respectively.
 Repeat this process for the remaining subnets, resulting in:
  
 Subnet B: Range = 129.19.40.15 - 129.19.40.29, subnet mask \28
 Subnet C: Range = 129.19.40.30 - 129.19.40.77, subnet mask \26
  
Thank you in advance to anyone willing to either confirm or correct the above :)

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you look at the CQURE Hacks 39 video on YouTube, it shows a quick demo of how easy it is to use pass-the-PRT to steal Azure PRT tokens even on a fully patched Windows system with Credential Guard enabled and TPM protections.
 The attack requires local admin access, but that isn't an insurmountable obstacle.
 Even if the local user doesn't have admin privileges, there are constantly application flaws, driver flaws and OS flaws that can be exploited to allow privilege escalation that would give the attacker local admin rights. Then there is just plain malware and zero day flaws between updates to do this if the attacker gets on a perfectly patched system. Users can be tricked into clicking on malicious links and opening files with malware and there is even occasional malware that requires no user interaction (Malvertisements and Outlook flaws that allow malware to run without even opening the message).
 You can have A/V and EDR to detect and block tools like Mimikatz, but Mimikatz does not need to run locally on the system. In the video, the data is copied to a different system with Mimikatz installed. No hacking tools need to be installed on the system being attacked.
 Besides all that can be done with the local user's Azure credentials to send spam and phishing emails and exfiltrate data, if any device admins had entered their credentials into the system (UAC prompt etc.) to assist the user within the last 14 days, their active PRT will also be on the machine and that would give the attacker access to everything the device admin has access to in the tenant.
 This type of attack gets around credential guard and TPM protections and then bypasses all forms of MFA and passwordless authentication (FIDO2 security keys etc.). So, what protection exists to prevent this?

 In Linux, you can use PAM (more specifically, pam_ssh_agent_auth) to authenticate to a machine through the use of an SSH agent, thus bypassing the need for a password. Is there anything like it for Windows, i.e. something which would allow you to authenticate/log-in to a computer upon startup - either bypassing or being used in conjunction with a password or other Windows Hello auth method? 
 Without going into too much detail, I've got a working agent, and USB device which stores/generates a pub/priv key pair. Furthermore, I've managed to make an SSH connection to my machine, from my machine.

 DH1- 48 connections
 DH2 - 48 connections
 DH3 - 96 connections
 I am figuring on 4 Cisco Meraki MS120-48 connected to Cisco Meraki MS410-16 for aggregation and connection to our existing network. 
 Networking isn't my strongest suit, we currently use Cisco Meraki for all our other switches. That is why they were selected, but i need very little management, and the traffic requirement is pretty low, based on it just being modbus data. If i can do it much cheaper with "dumber/cheaper" devices, is it worth it?

 MSTP is running on all switches. If I turn it off on switch (a), my SIP packet from my phone to 224.0.1.75 makes it to the server. If I turn it back on, it blocks it.
 When MSTP is on, the port state does not change from forwarding. There are no loops.
 Some part of MSTP blocking multicast. Any ideas?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Here is the scenario. My wife is a school teacher at a new school. To visualize her new classroom, imagine a square with the white board and smart projector installed on the front wall. 
 The back wall is cabinets and counter tops from one side to the other. Also on the back wall and above the countertops, is the ethernet port for her computer, printer, and the phone line for her classroom phone. The pervious teacher was clearly using the countertop as her desk, which kept her back to the kids, forced her to sit on a stool, and block some cabinets with her desk. 
 Ideally, my wife would like to have her computer/desk at the front of the room, so that she can face her students while at her desk. This would require 30 foot of cords to cross the room. Is there some way to have her computer at the front of the room, without cords, and still be plugged in to the ethernet? 
 Any help or advice would be appreciated.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a junior sysadmin in charge of a small network that services 300+ users. The network/domain infrastructure was built by a contracting company and I swear it was designed to be broken from day one. There are 50+ virtualized servers to manage and I barely know anything about them because I came here two years after the installation and the previous sysadmins were hotshots that only applied bandaid fixes so they couldn’t tell me anything of value. The only people that saw how it ran as intended are long gone and I’m stuck piecing together whatever I can with my limited experience. Getting information out of the contracting company is next to impossible because I have to fight my way through their help desk that of course only answer to emails. And even then they are intentionally vague in order to bait my company to pay extra to go fly over to fix whatever’s wrong. I might as well not even be here. The contractors were supposed to build the network then hire junior techs to maintain it but how am I supposed to maintain anything when it’s all hidden behind a contract. I have full access to the network. Im not just a user with limited access. Yet I feel like im running into a new major issue every week and nothing is ever a quick fix or even something I’ve dealt with before. It almost feels like it was engineered to be complicated and they convinced their clients to hire under qualified techs so they can get more money to fly out and be the “subject matter experts”. I’m so sick and tired of this, it’s actually killed my desire to continue working in this field because I’m being set up left and right by these greedy fucks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Basically the title.
 I'm an IT manager/sysadmin, in charge of a small team for a company of over 200. When it comes to "IT" people, I'm the top of the organization. My boss is a person who is sort of a catchall for departments that don't have a home. They lead a bunch of random "teams" and have no real knowledge or interest in IT at all.
 In previous roles I've had at minimum an IT Director above me who could advocate for IT in the strategy of the organization, even if they weren't assisting or super knowledgeable about the tech itself. I've found that without that, IT is very much pushed off to the side and viewed as a bother. Even when we're doing projects that are genuinely to assist the staff, no one is taking that up the chain to get buy in from the higher ups.
 Anyone else in a position like this?

In researching this I found these instructions which have a blurb stating "NOTE The rebuild is always sourced from the primary SD card to the secondary SD card." I have also read on blogs/etc that you just put a new card in the old cards slot and let it rebuild on boot. 
 For anyone that has rebuilt an IDSDM array on an older Dell server running iDRAC 8. Do I need to move the good SD2 card to the SD1 slot, put a replacement card in SD2 and then rebuild -or- can I simply replace SD1 and rebuild?
 ​
 Also, this is my homelab, I know that VMWare on SDCard is not best practice I don't need this to devolve into that. I just need to rebuild the array correctly.

 I need to prevent a remote desktop session from going into idle. The setting to not logout/disconnect user was already made, but still if I let the window, minimize and work on something else, it shows as idle:
 in cmd: query user /server: MY_SERVER, shows idle after 1 minute of inactivity
 I need to have this active all the time, as a user makes some activity, since I have some scheduled tasks that will run some GUI actions/applications. Also the remote connection will at some point start by itself, if the server gets rebooted or so.
 What I have tried:
 - mouse jiggler
 - caffeine
 - autohotkey scripts (click and pressing keys)
 - powertoys - awake
 -vbs, powershell scripts
 None of them worked. The cmd query still showed idle after one 1 minute
 Am I missing something? Does this have to do with windows being opened (not minimized), or having focus or something else? Is there any tricky thing regarding how windows detects inactivity
 If I have the window not minimized, and something is running (like a mouse jiggler or something) then, the connection is not being shown as idle at all
 Thank you
 ​
 P.S. Hopefully I did not put this into the wrong category. But I did not found one for the remote desktop connection

I haven't stopped working, nor have I quit doing tickets, deployments, etc but I have taken a much more relaxed and hands-off approach; only doing what needs to be done, not trying to do a million things a day that aren't essential.
 But I've realized I'm taking it a bit to far and not pulling my weight, upholding my obligations. My team isn't to bothered by this because they know I do my work when I'm asked but I don't want to become a lazy lard and let it become an issue (could be thinking to much into it).
 Like I said, I'm not coming back cold turkey. I've been working, but not up to my own standards. (I'm grateful my team let me do this because I was under stress but I want to get back to help them on more complicated matters like deploying VDI, and a new virtualization stack at another office).
 ​
 Any advice for someone who wants to get back into the saddle and start being more productive?

 I have a portchannel with two 10Gig ports. There are two VLANs in trunk in this portchannel and I would like to limit the bandwidth for the vlan as follows:
 VLAN1990 - Allocated 1Gbit
 VLAN1991 - Allocated 19Gbit
 VLAN1990 is vlan with multicast TV service, when the other VLANs traffic is more than 19Gbit, it causes the disruption of TV service.
 I tried to create the class-map with "match vlan 1990" but this command is apparently not available on C4900M, we are running:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[We are in the process of renewing our RDP deployment in Azure. The current servers are all Server 2012 and since this OS will be end of support by October 2023, we have created a new deployment with all Server 2022 VM's.
 We provide our applications within the RDP deployment as RemoteApp. Users can acces the RDWeb page through URL cloud.example.com where they have to login and then see the icon(s) of the applications they can use. 
 When the new environment is fully functional, we will point the DNS server to the IP address of the new RDWeb server, but we are not yet fully ready for that. When we open the RDWeb from within the server, we can login and start an application, but when we try to do that from outside the environment (by IP address, ie https://123.12.3.4/rdweb/pages/en-US/default.aspx) we still can login to the server but applications won't open. Instead, an error message is shown:
  
RemoteApp Disconnected 
 Remote Desktop can't connect to the remote computer "cb.cloud.example.com" for one of these reasons: 
 1) Your user account is not authorized to access the RD Gateway "cloud.example.com"
 2) Your computer is not authorized to access the RD Gateway "cloud.example.com"
 3) You are using an incompatible authentication method (for example, the RD Gateway might be expecting a smart card but you provided a password) 
 Contact your network administrator for assistance.
  
​
 We are not sure why this is happening. Could this be because we are not accessing the environment by the domain cloud.example.com but by IP address? Any suggestions on where to look at are welcome. 
 Of course, I would prefer to test accessing the RemoteApp over the domain name, but unfortunately this requires help from external parties that are not available to me at the moment.

 I have a few users who have told me that some e-mails from specific other users are missing. I can find them in my backup and restore them, but the users are 100% sure they don't delete them (I know, I know.. ) they just don't show up anymore when they search for them in Outlook. 
 Does any of you have any suggestions where to start? I've told the users that Outlook shouldn't be used as an archive for important mails, but still, what could cause this? It seems random and has nothing to do with specific dates or mail older than xx, it's just completely random "missing" mail in their inbox. 
 Thanks in advance!

 TLDR: Where to learn
 ​
 I apologise in advance for the broken english.
 I have been helping around at work (small factory) with the IT system and the ways to improve it.
 Since we obtained good results my boss asked me if I wanted to take on the role full time, since the factory is growing and the old IT systems (all LAN cabled, nothing online, no Active Directory, all devices on microsoft HOME 10 and server with no backup as basically a dump-in archive of documents).
 At this point, improving would mean having a site hosted on our server, dividing it in different virtual machines and setting up a DNS to be able to reach it from outside and inside without displaying the Public IP.
 Now, I have learned by myself 3 quarters of the things I'll need to do, the only doubt is the DNS part (and everything correlated as HTTP, Certificates ecc..), since I can't really understand where to read online.
 In your experience i need to go the old way and spend some nights on youtube/reddit/forums or there is a book/course you can recommend me?

 so basic premise: We are trying to get intune (we probably only need Plan 1) for the Deployment of Laptops and MDM for our iPhones and iPads, together with it being a good tool for inventory and patch management.
 We are a 250 people company at the end of the year with 4 offices in 1 EU Country, that runs Hybrid with a AD Connector and we will have DC in every office. 
  
Are there relevant benefits for us in intune plan 2? 
 
Regarding safety. Expect the conditional access and some nice to have things like Self service password reset. Any opinions on Azure AD P1/P2? We do use the default MFA functions that come with default o365 
 
Some higher ups want to use Windows Hello For business, is this only in M365 E3 and higher? Currently we run on Win-Licenses for the Device not the user

 We decided its time to hire a sysadmin. 
 Now with developers the rule is to give them minimal access, which is required to do their tasks. 
 This rule does not translate well for a sysadmin. He will need full access to our microsoft environment and he will need access to our mail domain account, so he can tweak DNS settings etc. Thats a lot of access.
 I am curious how other companies handle that? Do you give so much access on day 1 or do you give him smaller projects to build trust first?
 Currently I am planing to give him full access to the microsoft environment, but not to DNS settings. Here he has to work with us.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Currently, our team is heavily invested in the process of having field cabling installed. Our approach looks something like this:
  
Ticket arrives requesting additional cabling/outlets from our Service Desk
 
If required, we will visit the site and determine the exact location and placement of the outlets based on the requirements of the customer
 
We take those requirements and feed them to an external cabler for a quotation (Cablers are vetted and know our Standard)
 
Once the quotation is provided we pass this to the end customer and let them review it and decide if they want to proceed
 
If the customer ends up proceeding with the quotation, we will work with our Facilities Maintenance to organize Fire isolation
 
Once the cabling is installed, we will visit the site and patch in outlets, and provide patch leads for the work area
 
 During this process, we are documenting and recording details and keeping a register of all information collected (Quote, Request details, Cable test results etc.). We're doing this about 2-3 times a week. I find this is somewhat "low value" work I'm wondering if others push this to their facilities team and only interface in this work as a point of escalation?
 Some of the drawbacks to doing this:
  
Staff are fickle, things change and a single site visit can turn into multiple
 
Stuff changes, cabling can be installed as requested, and then a project changes its mind and the desks are now on the other side of the room
 
Sometimes with this work, you become a defacto project manager because the cabling is in the critical path
 
There are only so many hours in the day while doing this work... you're not deploying new kit or working on audits and cleanups
 
This process is followed by our Junior and Senior Engineers alike

 we are about to pull the trigger on SentinelOne. 
 We have some doubts on our reseller (EU based). 
 Are there different SKUs for S1 for server and clients? Our reseller insists that there are and they are charging double for those. Apparently the modules are not different in those descriptions. 
 I do not have any access to distributor or other resellers. Could you please just confirm that there are or not those different SKUs.
 ​
 Thank you all in advance.

 We have some standalone ESXi hosts in our company. Recently we encountered a werid issue where the mac address of the ESXi host flapping.
 Issue description:
 I found that the IP of some esxi hosts will occasionally be unable to ping, but the vm network on the host will not be interrupted. At this time, if you ping the IP of the ESXi host on a server in the same VLAN, the ESXi host network will be restored.
 At first, I thought it was due to the EEE function of the NIC. So I upgraded ESXi version(ESXi 6.5 -6.7-7.0), disabled the igbn driver and enabled the ign driver, disabled EEE function but these did not work.
 I finally found that when the issue occurred, ESXi host MAC would flap to G2/1 port. G2/1 port is connected to Sangfor Access Control Device and AC device is connected…]]></summary>

 We are having an issue in our environment with update KB5014754 (https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5014754-certificate-based-authentication-changes-on-windows-domain-controllers-ad2c23b0-15d8-4340-a468-4d4f3b188f16).
 All our DCs have the security patch installed and when our users try to login with their certificate (using a SmartCard), event 39 is being logged on the event log. We are trying to create a strong certificate binding with the AD attribute altSecurityIdentities (issuer + serial number) but it's not working, the event 39 keeps showing after updating the attribute:
 - altSecurityIdentities = 'X509:<I>C=ES,O=(redacted),OU=(redacted),OID.2.5.4.97=(redacted),CN=(redacted)<SR>(inverted SN)'
 We have tried to configure the altSecurityIdentities in several different ways, we have added the certificate to the user on AD and a we have done a lot of different tests, but event 39 keeps appearing, so we are a little bit lost. Do you know where could we investigate further or what could be the cause for event 39 still being logged?
 Thank you!

 ​
 All the system, cables everything is about 20 years old and all of the things inside is out. The room has no cabinet, old pc cases etc. 
 ​
 What I have to do is take the shelves to outside of the room to make up space, build 42U Cabinet, build 2x48 Port switch, couple patch panels, build some rack servers or a workstation. And then move the ups, file server and rest pc's to the cabinet, reconnect them. Remake about 20-30 cable connectors, label each of them. 
 ​
 In total cables are about 50 and they only said not to replace the whole cable. Only I can move and make a new connector.
 ​
 The thing is I said to them I would check the parts and prices for them, will not get a commission. 
 It is roughly 5-day job and I am not familiar with the market. New in the country(US-CA) so I would have some opinions if you could just guide me.
 ​
 Thanks a lot!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi everyone, I have an unorthodox situation I'm trying to figure out. I'm going to give a very simplified version of the problem I am trying to solve, for simplicity purposes.
 I hope that the smart people here can help me out so that I don't need to buy and install additional copper NICs.
 We are in the midst of a network re-design so I am trying to make do with what we have at this current time to try to make my new server function. In a nutshell, I want to combine what used to be two copper access ports from two physically separate networks to a single SFP connection which my new server has, and assign them to my VMs by VLAN. 
 Old scenario:
 I have an old server that had 2 copper NICs each connected to respectively 2 physically separate networks. The access ports come from Cisco 2960X without VLANs configured. At this time, it is not possible to have these reconfigured.
 On the server, NIC1/Network 1 was attached to VM1, and NIC2/Network 2 was attached to VM2.
 This has worked fine for years.
 New scenario:
 I have a new server that only has 1 SFP port.
 Is there a way I can combine or (reverse) trunk these two networks so that my new server can see either network depending on what VLAN I assign to each VM?
 I tried to create two access ports, Port1 on VLAN10 for Network 1, and Port 2 on VLAN 20 for Network 2. I then connected Port 24 (SFP Trunk) to my new server. This didn't seem to work.
 I have been toying with the scenario and it doesn't work. I know I must be doing something silly, but I feel like there should be a way to make it functional.
 I have a diagram drawn up of my test design but I can't seem to upload it yet as I might be too new.
 Hope someone can help!
 Thank you!

 We're installing devices on the wells that will provide measurements for what is going on. However, we need some kind of network to get the data to our offices. 
 We have a separate electrical grid that supplies power to all of the wells, so that is not an issue. 
 What is the best solution here? Is there way to have a giant mesh network with thousands of nodes all connected to each other over this giant acreage? What are some possibilities for creating such a network?
